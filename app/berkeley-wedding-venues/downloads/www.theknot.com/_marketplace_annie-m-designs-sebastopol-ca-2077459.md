Annie M.

owner

Hi, I’m Annie! Since a young girl I’ve had a deep passion for creativity, a love for nature, and a pull towards flowers. My background in mixed media painting and jewelry making has shaped my unique approach to floral design. I work and live on 3 beautiful acres on my Grandparents old farm property with my loving punk rocker husband and sweet cat. My floral business flourished from planning and styling my own wedding and through that process I fully understand the importance of details from the perspective of the Bride. I pour my heart & soul into my creative business and feel so fortunate to be doing what I love!

h me to ensure the order fit my needs. I did not have a specific vision in mind, just a color palette, vibe, and a few Pinterest inspo photos and let Annie work her magic - all of the florals (bouquets, centerpieces, aisle arrangements, chuppah mounts) were absolutely stunning!! Still one of my favorite things about my wedding, and Annie executed the perfect vision. She was so easy to work with, responsive, professional, and worked with my photographer, caterer, and venue to make set up seamless and a breeze. I would highly highly recommend Annie!

She is so thoughtful, kind and professional and worked with me to incorporate some of my own hand thrown pottery into the arrangements as well. She is an incredibly talented florist and we were thrilled that we got the opportunity to work with our top choice! Our guests kept messaging us after to gush about how insanely beautiful the florals were. If you want top tier service and stunning floral design she is the cream of the crop. 100000000/10!

It’s hard to find the words to describe how absolutely incredible our experience with Annie was. It goes so far beyond her immense talent and exquisite creations. The arrangements ...

she created for us were true works of art; stunning, evocative and wildly creative. Her attention to detail, brilliant eye for beauty and a magical touch unique to her- we could never have imagined that someone who we had never met, could somehow create wedding flowers that were so perfect for us. And the flowers are just the beginning of what she gave us. She also provided exceptional communication, answering all my questions and tackling all my (many) desires and requests with warmth, patience and care. She went above and beyond to fulfill our every wish and even brought sweet surprises, including special keepsakes that we will treasure forever. I can’t say enough how wonderful it was to work with her- we started calling her the flower angel! Everyone at our wedding said the flowers were the most beautiful they had ever seen. I actually made a photo of my bouquet the background on my phone so I could look at it every day. She is an extraordinary artist and a lovely human and we will tell everyone how much we adore her for many years to come.

Annie’s florals made my wedding vision come to life! We got married on the beach in Monterey, Ca. I had a vision of creating a coastal, vintage aesthetic for the day. We went with ...

blush color tones in gold vases and they looked so beautiful paired with the white sand beach that we got married on. Annie not only created beautiful arrangements but also helped me make decisions on the layout of the flowers and decor. Her flowers added so much to my dining tables, cocktail tables, and cake and welcome table. Annie was wonderful with communication and went above and beyond to make sure everything looked perfect. Floral designs is definitely Annie’s passion and I felt very assured knowing that her commitment to quality would be reflected on our special day. One of the highlights of my wedding was when I saw my bouquet for the first time! It was the most beautiful bouquet I have ever seen! It was so full and fresh and she wrapped the stems with a frayed velvet ribbon. She even had a card for me with some descriptions of the flower meanings. Annie’s attention to detail and little touches added so much and was beyond what I had ever imagined. Annie is truly dedicated to making her client’s flower dreams come true and I can’t encourage you enough to hire her for your special day.
