s, stress-free, and incredibly memorable. The views are absolutely stunning—rolling vineyards, beautiful open space, and a ceremony site that feels both elegant and naturally romantic. Our guests couldn’t stop talking about how gorgeous the setting was, especially during the ceremony. What truly sets Eagle Vines apart, though, is the staff. Everyone was professional, warm, and attentive, but a special thank you goes to Tiffany. She was phenomenal to work with—responsive, organized, and genuinely invested in making our day perfect. Communication throughout the planning process was easy and clear, which made the entire experience feel calm and stress-free. If you’re looking for a venue that combines breathtaking scenery, an incredible ceremony space, and a team that truly cares, we cannot recommend Eagle Vines highly enough. It was the perfect place to celebrate one of the most important days of our lives.

We are so pleased and satisfied with the level of professionalism and execution with this venue for our wedding. Since day one with our communication with Tiffany, we received time...

ly response, detailed information and adequate answers for our various questions, and continuous support whenever we needed recommendations from vendor selections, timeline, menu options, accommodations to our specific requests. Tiffany went out of her way to meet us where we were at budget-wise, cultural traditions, and the flexibility to access the facility. The venue is absolutely beautiful and the staff is super friendly. Parking is spacious and close distance to the ceremony. There is a bridal suite that is available to the bride to get ready the day of the wedding. They go above and beyond to ensure you are happy! There are many choices in Napa, but I am so happy we decided to have our wedding here. I would book this venue again in a heartbeat. The food was delicious and serving size for the buffet was plentiful. Thanks again for such a beautiful day that I will remember for the rest of my life. Truly blissful!

alked onto the property we were in awe of its beauty, and even after several visits, on our actual wedding day we were still amazed by the beauty that it holds. It is absolutely breathtaking. We loved how the ceremony was on the grass right next the vineyards overlooking the mountains. It provided for wonderful pictures afterwards! The reception area inside the tent was beautiful as well, with the white drapings, the chandelier lights, and the wooden backdrop. It was really nice that you could leave your car overnight after the wedding and come pick it up the next morning. The venue is gated so definitely secure. We loved that this venue only required us to get catering and alcohol done by them. This allowed us to get extra outside food such as desserts from other vendors. Tiffany was our main contact and she was amazing from start to finish. She is very energetic and professional. She was very prompt in her responses and made sure to follow up with us. The food itself was actually really good! We received many compliments from our guests not only on the beauty of the venue but the dinner itself too. We were also really happy how accommodating and involved the chef was. For one of our dishes the beef we had opted to have tortellini accompany it, but Tiffany called us to say the chef personally recommends a mushroom risotto that is normally not on the menu but something he’ll do special since he thinks the two pair well together. We are so thankful for the advice because the risotto was delicious and did pair extremely well with the beef. We both voiced we had wanted tortellini initially since we both love tortellini and since we were getting the beef the chef made us our own plate of tortellini to try as well! We would highly recommend this venue to anyone looking for a location in the Napa area. It is in a prime location close by to Napa for a weekend getaway for your guests for wine tasting. Also, just the beauty of this venue says it all, you definitely will not be disappointed.

As a recent bride however, the best part about this place was the wedding coordinators, Tiffany and Denise who made every step of this destination wedding for us possible, flexible, and wonderful! The grounds are breathtaking, the pictures we took our incredible, the food was delicious. This location allows you to be as creative as you'd like and with all the beauty surrounding it it does not require much extra which saves a lot on cost. I miss it already and hope to visit next year on our anniversary! My only hope is that other future brides appreciate its value and beauty and keep it as charming as it is. Neighboring competitors did not even come close to this place!! It is a hidden gem. ♡
