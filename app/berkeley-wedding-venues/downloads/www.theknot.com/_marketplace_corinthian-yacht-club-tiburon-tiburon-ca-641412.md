Imagine your "I do"s surrounded by one of California's most jaw-dropping panoramas, encompassing Tiburon's rustic downtown, the deep waters of Raccoon Strait, Angel Island's wooded profile, the silvery Bay Bridge, and the high hills and towers of San Francisco. Combine this stunning setting with a legacy of impeccable, gracious service, and you'll get a sense of what Corinthian Yacht Club has to offer. This Marin County landmark is housed in a striking Colonial Revival building with grand 40-foot columns and a pristine white façade. The entire third floor is yours to transform into the wedding of your dreams; throughout your celebration, the experienced and attentive team will ensure every detail is flawless, from perfectly timed hors d'oeuvres to seamless transitions between events. The Grand Ballroom, the jewel in the club's crown, is a redwood-paneled room with a 22-foot-high ceiling, an imposing stone fireplace, and a large stage. Giant picture windows in the adjoining Sun Porch afford sweeping bay vistas, with a connected outdoor deck perfect for soaking in the sunsets. A cozy Cocktail Lounge, adorned with nautical décor and a granite-topped bar, adds a touch of yacht-club charm.

Our experience with the Corinthian Yacht Club was good. The view from this venue is unmatched. The space is perfect for a large group-- it has room for a dance floor and a stage fo...

r the band. The food was very good and we paid $21 corkage to bring in our own wine. We brought in a lot of our own purchased decor along with rentals and their team was very helpful and set everything up for us. They also make sure the bride and groom get their own plate of hors d'oeurves and we got our dinner first. We felt well taken care of! Photos by Ellie Koleen Photography.

I have always loved the Corinthian, even so I looked at many locations for our wedding before choosing. I love the high ceilings, view, warmth of the wood interior, the outdoor dec...

k - it can go from elegant to casual. Lelia and her team are WONDERFUL to work with - both relaxed and organized. The whole staff really seemed to deeply care that the day went well for us. We did a plated salad then small plate food stations for dinner and I would recommend going that route if budget permits. I have to say we were lucky with the weather - I picked the night of the full moon and it was magical - moon rising over Angel Island, City view - beautiful!
