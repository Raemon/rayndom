**Lyrics you'll love:** "I've tried to hide it so that no one knows/But I guess it shows/When you look into my eyes/What you did and where you're comin' from/I don't care, as long as you love me, baby" 

This classic hit from your favorite boy band is a must for a mashup and choreographed wedding dance, complete with '90s dance moves. It's got enough romance for a slow dance, or you can pair it with something more upbeat for your first official dance as a married couple.

## 13\. "I Need You Tonight," _Millennium_

**Lyrics you'll love:** "All those endless times we tried to make it last forever more/And baby, I know/I need you/Oh oh, yeah, I know deep within my heart"

Here's another piano-heavy song that fits seamlessly into any wedding playlist, from the ceremony to the final song of the night. This is especially a must if you have a live band or quartet that can add some strings to this beautiful melody.

## 14\. "I Promise You," _Black & Blue_

**Lyrics you'll love:** "You're searching for clues of just how deep my feelings are/How do you prove the sky is blue, the oceans wide?/All I know is what I feel when I look into your eyes/I promise you from the bottom of my heart/I will love you till death do us part/I promise you as a lover and a friend"

If you're marrying your best friend, this sweet song is an excellent way to show your appreciation for them and their love. Plus, it has the added bonus of the lyrics "I will love you till death do us part," so consider an instrumental version during your vows.

## 15\. "Safest Place to Hide," _Never Gone_

**Lyrics you'll love:** "When this whole world gets too crazy, yeah/And there's nowhere left to go (nowhere left to run)/I know you give me sanctuary/You're the only truth I know/You're the road back home"

For your person, your home and the one who makes you feel at ease, this Backstreet Boys love song may just bring tears to your eyes when it plays. Imagine this as your first dance or during your walk down the aisle.

## 16\. "I Want It That Way," _Millennium_

**Lyrics you'll love:** "You are my fire/The one desire/Believe when I say/I want it that way" 

You can emulate the choreography from this Backstreet Boys video during your first dance for an exciting throwback your guests will love. Pair it with "Everybody (Backstreet's Back)" for a fun way to start the celebrations at your reception.

## 17\. "All of Your Life (You Need Love)," _This Is Us_

**Lyrics you'll love:** "I wanna know/Can we spend this life together/Be a shield from rain and weather/Tell me can I/Baby tell me can I be your man"

This song brings the dance club vibes of the late '00s while still giving the boy band harmonies you know and love from BSB. Use this party tune post-first kiss, during your reception entrance or as your exit song for an unforgettable night.

## 18\. "It's Gotta Be You," _Millennium_

**Lyrics you'll love:** "Now I know why I was born/You feel my feelings one by one/Can't see the world I'm walking through/'Cause baby I see only you, oh yeah"
