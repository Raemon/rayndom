About this vendor

Based out of Santa Rosa, CA, Moonlight Blooms Farm is a one-stop shop for all your wedding floral needs. What sets them apart is that they are not only florists but also farmers specializing in DIY buckets of blooms, a la carte weddings and full service weddings. They sustainably grow seasonal flowers that are exquisite, farm fresh, elegant and a little bit wild. With enough time they can even grow the color palette and variety of seasonal blooms you prefer. Many of their flowers are unusual in that they are not easily available through other florists because of their fragility (think Dahlias and Zinnias). They simply can't endure the intense handling necessary to package and deliver flowers over a long distance. Because they grow and handle the flowers themselves, they can provide unique farm fresh blooms that will set your flowers apart! Just let them in on your color palette, likes, and dislikes, and they will take it from there. Moonlight Blooms Farm's pricing is transparent. They can easily piece together bouquets, boutonnieres, flower crowns, corsages, centerpieces, venue decor, and more to suit your taste. Alternatively, you can order a bucket of blooms or host an arrangement-making party to whip up your own. Get in touch to know more or receive a quote.

Hiring Moonlight Blooms as our florist was the best wedding decision we made. From the very beginning, the team at Moonlight Blooms seemed just as excited about our wedding as we w...

ere, and they put so much love and care into creating floral arrangements that were perfect beyond our wildest dreams. We told them the colors and vibe we wanted and trusted them with the rest, and we are so glad we did. They designed the most jaw-droppingly gorgeous arrangements for us, and set them up at the venue perfectly. No one could stop talking about how stunning our flowers were. They even created a custom lapel arrangement for my partner that turned out SO COOL. We also love that they only use local and sustainable blooms. Not to mention how affordable and transparent their pricing is. We really cannot say enough good things about Moonlight Blooms, and we highly recommend trusting them to bring your wedding floral dreams to life.

Katie did the florals for my wedding and they were so lush, colorful and perfect! When I started working with Katie I just knew I wanted lots of colorful, spring flowers and I did ...

not want to spend a ton. I did not have to give Katie much direction, she was totally able to work with my limited knowledge of flowers. Katie delivered the most beautiful florals and bloom buckets for me! The arrangements were sturdy and lasted all night. The flowers she chose were dynamic and very unique looking. All the flowers were perfect; I highly recommend Moonlight Blooms for your wedding florals!

nity to go right to her farm and see/pick out the perfect flowers for the wedding! The cost/ experience value was excellent, and I stayed under budget, which as any bride will tell you, is key! Whether or not you’re getting flowers for a wedding, birthday, special occasion, you’ll not find a better, sweeter local farm!

oach, attention to detail and outstanding customer care make them outstanding as florists; their exquisitely fresh and unique flowers lift them over the top! My wedding flowers were perfect! My bouquet was the most distinctive and gorgeous composition of dramatic, textured and delicate blooms, in an exquisite color palate. Our boutonnieres, bridesmaid bouquets, and table arrangements were all beyond our imagination. Our wedding flowers were so fresh that they continued to bloom and evolve for weeks afterward, extending the glow of our remarkable day! I am so grateful for Moonlight Blooms for making such a creative design statement for our wedding day and delivering a lasting impact. Thank you! Thank you!
