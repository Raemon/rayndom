tists were simply incredible. The experience began with my MUAH preview two months before the wedding (see attached photo), where Taylor made me feel so comfortable and confident. She listened carefully to my vision and offered expert recommendations that perfectly enhanced my ideas. Beyond her amazing talent, Taylor is such a kind, calming, and FUN presence—a true gem to work with. On the big day, Taylor and her team seamlessly handled hair and makeup services for myself and 9 other women. Our group was wonderfully diverse in skin tone, age, and individual preferences, and they managed to make everyone feel stunning. I was initially nervous about finding a vendor who could accommodate our needs, but Taylor assured me her team had it covered, and they absolutely delivered. If you’re looking for a glam squad that is not only skilled but also warm, professional, and efficient, Bridal MUAH is the team for you. My wedding morning was smooth, stress-free, and filled with joy—and I owe so much of that to Taylor and her incredible team. 💕

and Haley consult me on every aspect of of my hair & makeup look (and I needed some direction and guidance!), their team also managed hair & makeup for 10 bridesmaids and two mothers and made it look easy (even though I know it was not). The whole team rocked each and every look and they ran a tight, on time ship - again, not an easy feat. Even my bridesmaids who had been in other weddings were seriously impressed by their skills. I got so many compliments on my hair & makeup that day and they made me feel like a million bucks. Plus, they're just FUN. Book them for your wedding - you will not be disappointed.

at we wanted, but she worked with what we did know we wanted and made everything gorgeous. We had a bit of a miscommunication the morning of so we were an hour behind schedule when she showed up, but her planning made sure she had plenty of buffer time. Not only did she get through all of us, she redid one bridesmaid’s hair to match the others and still had time to spare. Taylor was professional, had such fun energy, and really knew her stuff. I’d definitely hire her for your wedding needs if you want to put your faith in someone!

If I could give 10 stars, I would. Taylor and her BridalMUAH team is absolutely AMAZING! Taylor did my hair for one of my best friend's (and bridesmaid!) wedding, and I just knew ...

she had to do my hair for my wedding. I've had my hair done a handful of times for past events, and I was never happy with the result, but on my special day, I had exactly what I dreamed of! And it was brought to life by Taylor, so I cannot thank her enough!! Super professional, and settles for nothing less than perfect. Tyler did my makeup, and again, I was blown away. I feel like it is so incredibly hard to find a hair and makeup artist you actually love, but with Bridal MUAH, I did. I feel like what sets them apart, is they truly take the time to apply their talent that is customized to YOU and what YOU want. I wouldn't trust anyone else to do my hair and make up! Definitely 10/10 recommend.

Hair and Makeup was one of the most important vendors I was focused on for my wedding on 8/11/18. I started my search well before the usual 6-9months before. I tried a couple other...

salons/stylist but when I met Taylor I knew she was the best! She was very talented and creative. I had picked the hairstyle I wanted and we did a trial and then about 3 weeks before my wedding I had an unfortunate tan line that I wanted to cover up. Without having done it before, Taylor saw the picture I wanted and transformed my hair the day of my wedding. All my bridesmaids and mom/aunts loved her and her assistant. I've been in weddings before where the only person who liked their hair was the bride and it was really important to me that girls in my wedding didn't feel that way too. I can't think Taylor and her team enough for making my wedding dreams come true!

I cannot say enough wonderful things about Taylor. From our initial meeting (hair trial) I knew that she would be a perfect fit for me and my bridesmaids. She is incredibly sweet a...

nd very talented. She listens to what you want, responds well to feedback / changes and executes all styles flawlessly. I changed my look completely from my trial to my wedding day and Taylor was understanding and made me look beautiful. She is also the fastest stylist in the world and has a fantastic personality and attitude. YESSSSSSS, Taylor!

Tay has been my haircolorist/stylist for the last 10+ years of my life. She is beyond amazing at what she does. She has always had a gnat for all hair/makeup and she's clearly made...

her break through. She's braided me,colored me, trimmed me (and my daughter) and wouldn't trust anyone else. She is truly beyond talented and is so unique with her style. Taylor is so ridiculously talented in all ways to the point where you question your own skills lol . She deserves all praise...

Taylor and her team were life savers - I don't mean that lightly. I was SO lucky she was available A WEEK before my wedding as the women I had scheduled bailed on me. Taylor is no...

t only a sweetheart and easy to chat with but she was on-time, flexible, dedicated and amazing! When I told her that I wanted a woodsy, rustic, loose, braid pony she was SO excited to create it; which only affirmed that I should do it. It was literally everything I had envisioned and I received so many compliments about it. I will recommend to Taylor to every bride I know and work with. She is the best and worth every penny!

If you want to look fabulous and I mean Beyoncé fabulous Taylor is your girl! I have been using Taylor for the past several months and every time she creates the most unique and fa...

bulous hairstyles. She did all my events leading up to my wedding as well as my wedding and my hair always stayed in tact and looked gorgeous. She set up an amazing team and coordinated my giant bridal party of 15 ladies for both hair and makeup!!! We all looked perfect. Her braids are flawless, I can't tell you how amazing her fishtails look. Just show her a picture and she can make you look even better. She is professional and super friendly, and I can't say enough good things about her, just see for yourself. Her creativity is above and beyond any hairstylist I have ever been too!!! I can't wait to get styled by her again!!!

day to do my hair and I could not be happier. My hair was EXACTLY what I had envisioned and more. She also did updos and curls for my bridesmaids, mother, and flower girl, ALL of which were amazing! (Especially if you want any kind of braid... I am convinced she can do it better than anyone!). We all know how important hair is for your big day, and with how happy I was (and all my girls), I can confidently say Taylor will help make your day perfect!

Taylor was absolutely wonderful! I literally could not be happier with booking her for our wedding in Lake Tahoe. Regardless of it being an out of state wedding, Taylor was ready a...

nd on time for an 8 am hair/makeup start for my girls! Each of my bridesmaids and my mother were beyond delighted with her work. She even took the time to make sure my sweet flower girls felt special by braiding and curling their hair between the other appointments. Something she did not have to do since those were her few minutes of break during the long morning. If you are looking for one of the best stylists to ensure you look your best on your big day I would only recommend Taylor. Her professionalism and talent are such a relief for a very stressed out bride!

everyone, especially me!!! I loved loved loved my hair. She is very quick, which is great especially when you are running behind schedule., but her quality is never affected. She really takes the time to listen and understand what you like and brings your vision to life. I have very curly hair that I straighten and often gets frizzy in humidity, but Taylor prepped my hair so well that it did not frizz the entire time!! I would highly recommend Taylor for any bride who is looking for someone they can trust and who is so talented and will help make them beautiful on their special day!
