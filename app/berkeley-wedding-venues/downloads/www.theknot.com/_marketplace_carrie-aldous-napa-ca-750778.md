Carrie is absolutely AMAZING! Her talent and attention to detail is unmatched. I hired her for my wedding in May 2022. After working with her in the wedding industry, having her a ...

part of my special day was a no brainer. She focuses on skin care and making you an elevated version of yourself. Aside from her talent she is such a calming presence. As most brides know nerves are inevitable. She was amazing to have around and keeping things in perspective. She offers packages where she stays for pictures and ensures you look great. I cannot recommend Carrie enough. Thank you for making me feel like a bride and getting me down the aisle!

Carrie did my hair and makeup for my elopement. She came HIGHLY recommended by the venue for her personality and talent, and she definitely delivered on both! It was more than I ha...

d planned to spend but totally worth it. I was particularly nervous not being able to do a trial, but she totally understood exactly what I wanted and checked in with me all along the way. I don't usually wear makeup so usually I am uncomfortable with a full face of it, but it felt light and natural and I loved how I looked. Definitely go with Carrie if you can!

Carrie was so amazing. She first did my hair and makeup for my engagement shoot because I am a bit particular and afraid of people touching my hair. She was very reassuring and app...

lied the makeup in such a way as to enhance my beauty rather than to just pile on the makeup. Then, during the preview, she changed my hair style twice because the first time it was just not the direction I wanted to go. She really wants to make sure her clients feel themselves and feel beautiful and confident. It is so important to her, which is why she is so incredible. Finally, on the day of the wedding, she was so professional and amazing. She needed up doing my grandmothers hair, my mother's hair and makeup, and my hair and makeup. She was always on time, made everyone feel special and was so pleasant and fun to work with. She couldn't have created a better organic style for my hair and my makeup was just drop dead gorgeous! She even customized my false lashes! Then, she followed me to my venue to make sure I had the touchups I needed for the first look and family photographs before the wedding. All I can say is I'm sad I only was able to work with her twice! Pick Carrie! You will never regret it!
