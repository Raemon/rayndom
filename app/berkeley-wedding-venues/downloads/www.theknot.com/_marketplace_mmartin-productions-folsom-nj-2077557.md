Thanks to recommendations from couples on The Knot

Hey y'all, I'm Michael Martin Jr., owner of MMartin Productions, a wedding photography. I am located on the West Coast & East Coast as a Destination, Published, and Traveling Photographer / Cinematographer. I have been behind the lens since I was 18 years old. Over the years, I have developed a unique style that magically recreates a couple's love for one another. I passionately apply my motto, "Create, Capture, and Make Magic." Create to evolve from one's imagination, Capture the beauty in one's eye, and always Make Magic by seeing what is not in the lens but to envision what no one else can see. I would be honored to participate in any of your upcoming life events. Services Offered: I' am here with you every step of the way, capturing all those special moments on your big day! Those moments captured can not only be turned into thank-you cards but into canvas prints as well. I love to think outside of the box, and in doing so, I offer unique shots through aerial drone footage as well. Regardless of the style or method of capturing those special moments on your big day, I will ensure this will be the best investment you've made in your wedding planning process. I fully invest my time and attention in each couple; this is one of the most important days in your life.

I'm going to start off by saying BOOK HIM AND HIS CREW NOW!! I promise you it will be THE best thing you do for your special day!! I met Michael while he was photographing my frien...

ds wedding. Once I saw the pictures and videos from her wedding I fell in love with them. When I got engaged we booked him for our engagement pictures and he ABSOLUTELY SLAYED it. Captured exactly what I was going for. I found out he does travel photography and we ended up booking them for our Wedding in Hawaii before we even had a venue. Communication during the entire process was super simple. Him and his crew arrived on the island 2 days before the wedding and from the minute we all met, everyone just clicked. They blended in with our friends and family like we had known each other for years. We gave them full creative reign to capture whatever and however they wanted and IT WAS THE BEST THING WE EVER DID! Their attention to detail and their dedication to their craft is UNMATCHED. We did a pre wedding sunrise hike shoot, the wedding day, and a day after shoot and let me tell you what they captured was beyond anything I could have imagined. I cried and laughed and every other emotion in between looking through the photos and videos. Your photos and video are the only tangible things you have from your wedding day. When I tell you it is the one area you want to make sure you book someone you wont regret TRUST ME. Their vision is a beautiful thing and it will be one less thing you have to worry about on your wedding day! Michael and his team were born to do this and it 100% shows in their work. Booking them was without a doubt the best choice we made for our wedding and I promise you it will be for yours too! We booked a photographer for our wedding and ended up with someone we call a friend.

It’s hard to put into words just how thankful we are for Michael and the incredible work he did on our wedding video. From the moment we met him, he brought such a warm and calming...

energy that instantly put us at ease. Neither of us are used to being in front of a camera, but he made it feel so natural. Watching our video for the first time brought us both to tears. The way he captured the emotions, the laughter, the little looks and details, it honestly felt like we were reliving the day all over again. You can tell how much love and care he pours into his work. We’ll cherish this video forever. It’s something we’ll show our families, our friends, and one day our kids. Thank you, Michael for giving us the most meaningful keepsake imaginable and for being such a joy to work with. You made everything feel effortless, and we’re so grateful to have had you as part of our day. Xoxo, The Jones’s🖤

We thought we were just booking a photographer back in 2021 for our wedding in 2023, but little did we know we would be finding our lifetime one. Michael is now the only photograph...

er we trust to capture our most special moments. From his attention to detail, respectfulness, kindness, professionalism and overall personality, he is someone I would recommend over and over again. He understood every vision we had and truly made it come to life. He took his time to make sure we were comfortable and always joked around with us as if we were old friends. He even captured moments that I didn’t even think would be special to me or that he was even there to get it! As mention we thought we were getting a wedding photographer but he did more than our wedding. He got in the ocean to help capture our engagement photos, traveled to CT for an intimate couples session, spent all day at our wedding and just recently captured our first family photos in our new home. He was amazing with our new born daughter and truly captured moments that I will treasure forever. MMartin Productions is truly worth it all for any session you are looking for. He is more than just a one time photographer- he’s a lifetime one!

My husband and I had the absolute pleasure of working with Michael and his team for our wedding this past May, and we cannot recommend them highly enough! They were professional, e...

fficient, and genuinely wonderful to work with. We had a distinct moody, romantic, gothic vision for our wedding, and Michael captured it flawlessly. The entire process felt seamless and completely stress-free. Posing for photographs can be awkward (especially when your husband dreads having his picture taken), but Michael’s guidance and artistic direction put us at ease. The turnaround time for their work was exceptional. We received our entire gallery of edited photos and videos within a month, and the results truly speak for themselves. Without question, we will be booking Michael and his team again for future milestones, and we wholeheartedly encourage you to do the same!

Michael and Moi also brought fun energy and good vibes to the party, I am so happy they are a part of our memory forever! Michael has been amazing to work with. Michael and his team came highly recommended by many friends, and everyone that I know who have used Michael and his team have been blown away by their engagement, wedding and family photos. My fiancé and I felt so comfortable during our engagement shoot and had so much fun! We received an absolutely stunning photo gallery just a few days later! Michael really pays attention and listens to your needs to make sure the desired style and vibe of your photos come to life. Michael communicates well and provides resources and support to make sure every single detail of your wedding day will run smoothly and be captured accordingly. I cannot wait for our wedding day and would not trust anyone else to capture the memories on our special day!

He was on board with all of the ideas we had- from driving to Cape May, NJ to get in the ocean with us for our engagement photos, to driving to CT to capture personal intimate moments with the utmost respect and professionalism, and lastly to him and him assistant capturing every moment of our special day. He made us feel so comfortable to be around and work with. He worked so well with our videographer to capture photos and videos. He listened to all the styles we wanted and never missed a photo that was on our list. When we got our photos back, we were in awe of all the special moments he captured that we didn't even notice he took. Those photos are some of our most loved. Michael, will be someone we never want to stop working with for even family photo sessions and will be referring him to everyone and anyone.

professionalism and talent were clear. Everyone who has seen the photos knows that they captured the essence of who we are! The videographer and photographer did an amazing job documenting both our family and the more intimate moments, and every photo reflects the love and joy we felt that day.

If you're looking for a photographer who blends artistry and fun with genuine care for their clients, MMartin Productions is the way to go. We couldn't be happier with the results!

As a Bride & Groom or Parent with children, you want to preserve your special moments. Capturing a single photo among the chaos of a family session with energetic children, a less ...

than obedient dog and a father trying to multitask work and his wife’s demand of family photos seemed out of reach. Michael made it happen and did so patiently and creatively, capturing the natural moments we wished for. We are so pleased with his work and truly enjoyed being part of his art. He’s so easy to work with and managed to navigate our lack of direction and discipline to produce beautiful family photos.
