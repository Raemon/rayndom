**In this article:**How to Plan | Etiquette | Why Have an After-Party?

## What's the Party After a Wedding Called? 

The name of an after-wedding party is simply a wedding after-party. This additional gathering takes place after the wedding reception, either planned or impromptu. These extra bashes are totally optional and typically take place in another area of the wedding venue or at a nearby location. An after-party after a wedding will also typically skew more casual in terms of drinks, entertainment and energy. 

Do note that the party a day after the wedding is usually a different event than an after-party for a wedding (unless you purposely plan it otherwise). Often, these day-after gatherings take the form of a [wedding recovery day](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-recovery-day), where you might consider [planning a postwedding brunch](https://www.theknot.com/content/where-to-begin-planning-the-postwedding-brunch) for all of your guests to say goodbye in a more low-key setting, with chill, relaxation-based activities throughout the day for the wedding party to unwind.

## How to Plan a Wedding After-Party 

We've answered the question: "What's the party after the wedding called?" Now it's time to dive into how to execute one well—if you want to, that is. Your after wedding celebration can definitely be loosely planned (like calling ahead to a local bar to see if they're okay with an influx of wedding guests later in the evening), but for those who prefer some structure, read on. 

### 1\. Select Your Spot

![People dancing at night with confetti in the air](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/41e44c2d-525e-4bc3-b25e-c1e9bf668d42~rs_768.h)

Oftentimes, your reception venue will be able to accommodate an after-party, especially if it's a hotel or space that offers multiple event rooms. If not, scoot on over to [The Knot Vendor Marketplace](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/wedding-reception-venues) to browse venues (it'll yield much better results than frantically Googling: "wedding after-party venues near me." Proximity is key here: You want your wedding to flow seamlessly into the after-party, so prioritize wedding after-party venues close by so guests won't lose steam in transit. If your party spot isn't easily walkable, consider providing transportation like shuttle buses or offering ride-share codes for a seamless transition. 

Additionally, you should correlate your choice of where to have a wedding after-party with your anticipated energy level postreception. For example, a local dance club or arcade are both high-energy options, while a lively dive bar or jazz club are a touch more mellow. A cozy wine bar or listening bar are great, uber-chill options. You can also get inspired by your typical weekend plans as a couple and plan an after-party that feels like an authentic night out with you two. If you're posted up at a local brewery often, gather guests at a beer hall venue. If you're belting out tunes at your local karaoke bar, get musical with your people. 

### 2\. Think About Themes

Your choice of venue can inform some [wedding after-party ideas](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-after-party-ideas) for themes. And while you don't have to go full-send with a theme, it can be a fun excuse to explore an aesthetic totally different from your nuptials (especially if your wedding is more traditional). Chances are, most of your after-party attendees will be younger guests, so don't be afraid to get funky and cheeky. Example: If your wedding felt like an English summer garden, choose a wedding after-party theme like "sexy tropical tiki." If you're stuck, take the quiz above and get matched with one of our favorite wedding after-party themes.

### 3\. Figure Out Formality

Of course, your wedding after-party will likely be at least a little more relaxed than your wedding, but it's important to determine just how cozy and casual you'd like to get with your guests. Is your after-party energy more martinis and caviar bumps? Or beers and bowling? The formality level will influence the wedding after-party dress code for you and your newly minted spouse. (For example, should you look for [wedding after-party dresses](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-after-party-outfit) with fringe that'll shimmy and shake on a club dance floor? Or frocks with stretchy fabric that allow you to easily curl up in a cozy wine bar banquette?) Speaking of dress codes, save any specific attire requests for guests for something like a themed welcome party, as most won't have the time or place to change outfits between the reception and the after-party. 

### 4\. Score Decor (or Not)

![Event in a cave with various decor](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/82923775-ff66-4e3f-978e-8cd8a7b74a44~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.768.576)

_[Photo: Katherine Elyse Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/katherine-elyse-media-lawrenceburg-in-965818)_

A few candles and a disco ball are easy ways to create a party atmosphere, but don't feel pressured to bring in more decor. You can easily keep it simple and let the space's existing decorations do the work for you (even if it's a dive bar's neon beer sign—that's kind of a vibe, honestly.) 

### 5\. Settle on Sips and Snacks

![Small burger sliders](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/49af6355-0034-47e7-8c61-22da126a2a29~rs_768.h)

If you remember anything from this article, let it be to NEVER have an after-party without food. Ever. Wedding cake won't tide your attendees over into the wee hours, especially if they're still sipping cocktails well beyond dessert. Elevated snack food or comfort food will always go over well as wedding after-party food, like chicken and waffles, breakfast sandwiches, party sub sandwiches or a big order from a favorite fast-food chain. It can be as catered as a buffet or as casual as ordering a bunch of pizzas (your guests will sigh with relief once that stack of cardboard boxes comes through the door). [Food trucks](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-food-trucks) would also hit the spot. Another can't-miss ingestible: coffee. A late-night latte or espresso martini will help your guests fight fatigue.

### 6\. Identify Entertainment

![Guests dancing on the dance floor](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/c3041925-3663-43e3-b8b2-b8bbbdb6b3c0~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.768.576)

_[Photo: Joseph Lin Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/joseph-lin-photography-new-york-ny-350465)_

Think about how you'd like your guests to have fun at your after-party. If you're thinking of dancing more and you're not at a venue with built-in music, make sure you check in with your DJ to see if they can extend their time slot. You should also identify any after-party wedding songs you might want (because certain tracks are more enjoyable after the older crowd heads home). If your vibe is a little more low key, consider some wedding after-party games like cornhole, giant Jenga or Connect Four, or even a few simple board games. Anything you'd find at a brewery would translate well.

Just have them follow you to the party once they photograph whichever one of your undoubtedly amazing [wedding send-off ideas](https://www.theknot.com/content/18-creative-exit-toss-ideas) you decide on. Alternatively, place disposable cameras around the room (or in the hands of some VIP guests) to take some impromptu snaps throughout the event. "You can also have guests upload images from their phones to a file-sharing app," says Steve Feinberg, owner of [Bunn DJ Company](https://bunndjcompany.com/san-diego-wedding-djs/) in Charlotte, North Carolina.

## Wedding After Party Etiquette

The after-party for your wedding doesn't have nearly as many rules and traditions as the nuptials themselves, but there are some etiquette considerations to keep top of mind. Catch answers to your most-burning questions below, now that you already have the answer to: "Do weddings have after-parties?" 

### Who Pays for the Wedding After-Party?

Wedding after-parties are a somewhat new [wedding trend](https://www.theknot.com/content/gen-z-wedding-trends). As such, there isn't one definite person who "traditionally" foots the bill in the [breakdown of who pays for a wedding](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-budget-who-pays-for-what). Though, it's generally expected the couple pays for any food, drinks or entertainment at the celebration. Feinberg says that soonlyweds should set aside some extra dollars for the after-party as a part of their [wedding budget](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-budget-who-pays-for-what). 

"The after-party would be part of their budget if the couple paid for the wedding reception," says Feinburg. "Otherwise, whoever hosted the reception will cover the party costs. Ideally, guests shouldn't have to pay to attend a party." If you need some insight into local wedding costs, [The Knot Budget Advisor](https://www.theknot.com/wedding-budget) will be your bestie as you hash out your cash allocation. 

Jamie Chang, owner of and destination wedding planner at [Mango Muse Events](https://www.mangomuseevents.com/), suggests an alternative way to cover costs: "If it's more casual, like going to a nearby bar that's also open to the public, the couple could either take care of the tab or guests can cover their own drinks/food, or some combo where the couple covers the first hour or two and some initial snacks and then guests are on their own after that." An open bar is not necessary here, but you do need to communicate your decision to your guests either way so they can come prepared.

### When Should the Wedding After-Party Start?

The wedding after-party should begin directly after the wedding reception so that the upbeat energy continues into the next event—it's a key aspect of [planning your wedding timing](https://www.theknot.com/content/what-time-do-weddings-usually-start). "Having downtime in between kills the vibe, and people can decide [they] no longer [want] to attend the after-party," says Chang. "Even if not everyone shows up immediately, having it directly after just makes for a better continuation of the party and festivities."

If you're staying at the reception venue for the after-wedding bash, Feinberg says to "seamlessly move into the after-party with a change of lighting and [music](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-after-party-songs). Hand out glow sticks or necklaces to let guests know you're shifting into after-party mode." For example, if you're hiring a [live band](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-reception-music-questions-to-ask-a-band) for the reception, consider using a DJ for the rest of the night (one equipped with a killer [after-party playlist](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-after-party-songs)).

### Who Should You Invite to Your Wedding After-Party?

Deciding who to invite to the after-wedding party is simple: If they're invited to the reception, they're invited to the after-party. "It's the polite thing to do," Feinberg says. "If someone was kind enough to take the time to attend your wedding and deal with the expenses of being a wedding guest, that kindness should be reciprocated." Even if you know some of your guests won't be up for partying after the reception, still extend the invitation so no one feels snubbed. That said, you can position the party as more of an affair for younger attendees by choosing a location like a dance club or divey pool hall. But if your parents and their friends still want to come through, they should be welcomed onto the dance floor with open arms.

### How Can You Invite People to Your Wedding After-Party?

Unclear on how to invite people to a wedding after-party? Keep reading. Sending out party-after-wedding invitations isn't really a thing. If you want to ensure your guests are aware of the postwedding festivities (and won't make other plans), include the information on separate cards with your [wedding invitations](https://www.theknot.com/paper)—these cards will act as after-party invitations of sorts. You can easily customize a wedding details card on [The Knot Invitations](https://www.theknot.com/paper/invitations/wedding) to include this info. You should also mention it on your [wedding website](https://www.theknot.com/gs/wedding-websites?vers=0). Bonus: Once you have a wedding website on The Knot, you can use [The Knot Guest List Tool](https://www.theknot.com/gs/guest-list), which allows folks to RSVP to multiple wedding-adjacent events, to track after-party RSVPs. For a more low-key after-party, it's fine to let everyone know about the plan through word of mouth. Ask your wedding party to start spreading the news at the prewedding events and remind everyone of the plan during the reception.

**The Knot Expert Tip: No matter if you're partying until midnight or until dawn, if you're hosting a postwedding brunch or leaving early for your**[**honeymoon**](https://www.theknot.com/content/best-honeymoon-destinations)**the next day, make sure you've got someone to give you a wake-up call so you don't oversleep.**

## Why Have an After-Party?

Now that you have the lay of the land when it comes to how to have a wedding after-party, you might grapple with the choice of if you _should_ throw one. Here are a few benefits of another bash to help you make an informed decision:

### You Can Spend More Time With Loved Ones

Real talk: You're going to be super busy during the ceremony and reception. Your [wedding day timeline](https://www.theknot.com/content/a-traditional-wedding-reception-timeline) will be packed with things for you and your partner to do, like giving your [welcome speech](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-welcome-speech) and [cutting the cake](https://www.theknot.com/content/cutting-the-cake). In the end, you won't have as much quality time with your loved ones as you might think. Keep the party going if you want to celebrate your nuptials with your nearest and dearest even more.

### You Can Have an Outfit Change

A wedding after-party outfit is the perfect way to explore another facet of your style. If your "I do" look skews traditional—like a marshmallowy ballgown—maybe you opt for a mico sequined number you can really shimmy and shake in. Similarly, a slick suit can be dressed down with a fun patterned blazer. 

### Your Wedding Venue Has a Curfew

Lots of venues have to abide by restrictions from the city that limit noise levels depending on the time of day and zoned area. Usually, noise levels have to be lower at night and early morning to respect homeowners in residential areas or hotel guests. Unfortunately, to comply with noise restrictions, many venues aren't available to rent after 10 p.m. If you're more of a night owl, you can use an after-party as an excuse to keep the revelry going into the wee hours without compromising on your venue choice.
