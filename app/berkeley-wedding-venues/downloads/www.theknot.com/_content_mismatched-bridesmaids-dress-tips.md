When choosing wedding party attire, it's not always easy to please the whole group. Coordinating mismatched bridesmaid dresses, however, can be a great way to incorporate each person's unique style and preference. When executed correctly, this method allows your bridal party to look cohesive without being overly uniform.

There are a number of other reasons why you might choose to mix and match your bridesmaid gowns. According to [Kate Boswell](https://www.theknot.com/content/author/kate-boswell), Fashion Editor at The Knot, "coordinating a mismatched bridesmaid look is a great way to keep your wedding party members happy—not only because it allows them to infuse a bit of personal style into their look, but also because it provides a bit more flexibility when it comes to budget." "Giving bridesmaids options when it comes to where they buy their dress means they can choose how much they'd like to spend rather than being required to shell out a certain amount," she says.

"What I love about mixing and matching is that there are really no rules, says Grace Lee Chen, CEO and founder of [Birdy Grey](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=9ibcrDa*U1o&mid=44848&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.birdygrey.com%2F&u1=tk-mismatched-bridesmaids-dress-tips). "Brides are taking more risks these days, with various silhouettes and even mixing fabric." While opting for different [bridesmaid dress colors](https://www.theknot.com/content/what-color-bridesmaid-dresses-should-you-have) or styles is certainly on-trend right now, we're not quite ready to call matching gowns a thing of the past. Ultimately, the decision comes down to personal preference. Someone having a glam ballroom wedding may like the luxe uniformity of all-black matching bridesmaid dresses. On the other hand, an outdoor spring wedding might lend itself nicely to more laidback floral prints and patterns.

## How to Coordinate Mismatched Bridesmaid Dresses

![Mismatched bridesmaids dress ideas](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/f4e2196a-127b-494b-bfd5-e81dc51f632f~rs_768.h)

At the altar, non-matching bridesmaid dresses offer an effortlessly beautiful look, but coordinating outfits for each of your bridesmaids can actually require a bit of effort. "We definitely suggest that the bride provide some guidelines for their bridesmaids' dresses, like a color or a family of colors–the last thing you want is one person showing up in black and someone in a ruffled pink number," says Lee Chen. Fortunately, we're here to help make the process as seamless as possible. Here's our expert advice on how to nail the look.

### Create a Vision Board

When coordinating different bridesmaid dresses for your wedding party, Pinterest will become your best friend. [Creating a vision board](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-to-make-an-inspiration-board) filled with inspiration and dress options is a great way to give your group a better idea of the overall vibe and feel you're hoping to achieve. Better yet? You can fill your vision board with shoppable looks that you approve of and all your bridesmaids will have to do is pick the one they want. "As a bride, you should make sure your group understands the vision of the wedding, the venue, and the dress code, that way, their dress choices will be the perfect balance of what you want them to wear and what _they_ want to wear," says Lee Chen.

### Order Fabric Swatches

To narrow down your search, you'll want to see how various colors, patterns and textures look next to each other. The good news is that many bridesmaid dress brands make this easy, by offering fabric swatches that can be sent straight to your door. Take full advantage of this by requesting swatches of each color or fabric type you're considering. Remember, things can look different online, so it's always best to play it safe and have swatches on hand.

### Determine a Unifying Design Detail

Even if you decide to go the mismatched dress route, it's important to determine at least one consistent element between each look that will help create cohesiveness. For instance, you may give your bridal party the freedom to choose the style and cut they want for their gown, but request that the color match the specific swatch you've picked out. Alternately, you may not have a specific color in mind, but ask that they each pick out a thematic outfit, like a [floral bridesmaid dress](https://www.theknot.com/content/floral-bridesmaid-dresses-to-shop) or [boho bridesmaid dress](https://www.theknot.com/content/boho-bridesmaid-dresses), to keep with your vision. "For solids, choose a family of colors or a tone (muted, brights, pastels, etc.). For floral prints, it's easiest to start with a print you love and look for colors that show up in the print as a throughline," says Lee Chen.

### Shop From the Same Retailer

Many brands make it easy to coordinate a mismatched wedding party look by offering various bridesmaid dress styles in the same fabric, or different shades of popular wedding color palettes. For a more seamless shopping experience, consider working with a retailer that specializes in bridesmaid ensembles. They might even have stylists available to work one-on-one with your crew.

### Consider Convertible Dresses

One of the simplest ways to achieve a mismatched bridal party look is to go with convertible gowns. Convertible gowns are able to be worn in a variety of different ways. Going this route allows each of your bridesmaids to wear their dress in a silhouette that makes them feel the most confident. Plus, because there are so many different ways to style convertible dresses, they can even switch up their look between the ceremony and reception.

### Talk to Your Wedding Party

If you're unsure of whether you should go the mix and match route, consider getting your bridesmaids' opinions on the matter. While it's your decision at the end of the day, it may be helpful to hear from the group about what would make them feel the most comfortable and confident.

## 6 Ways to Mix and Match Bridesmaid Dresses

Ready to get inspired? Here are six of our favorite ways to coordinate mismatched bridesmaid dresses for your wedding day.

### Different Style Dresses in the Same Color

![Mixmatched bridesmaid dresses](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/b5885409-c638-4208-869a-a863a734b3a5~rs_768.h-cr_0.65.1000.1398)

Maybe you love the look of matching bridal party dresses, but want to cater to each of your bridesmaids' personal styles and preferences—after all, there's no "one size fits all" when it comes to fashion. If that's the case, you might want to consider bridesmaid dresses with different styles in the same color (think: varying lengths, necklines and silhouettes). Many bridesmaid dress retailers make it easy to coordinate this kind of look by giving bridesmaids a variety of shapes to choose from that can then be ordered in the color of the couple's choosing.

### Dresses in Different Shades of the Same Color

One way to incorporate different colored bridesmaid dresses without straying too far from your wedding color palette is to experiment with shades. If you have a desired color in mind for your bridal party's attire but don't like the idea of looking overly uniform, this might be the way to go. Once you've decided on the color, explore similar dress options in slightly darker or lighter shades. When you combine the looks together, you're left with a unique ombré effect. Pro tip: This method works especially well for larger bridal parties.

Who says you have to choose just one color for your bridesmaids' attire? Chances are, you've selected a handful of colors for your wedding, whether they're going to be incorporated into the floral arrangements, table settings or elsewhere. Why not have your squad rock those same colors down the aisle?

### A Mix of Solid and Patterned Dresses

When you think of bridesmaid dresses, chances are, an image of a solid-color gown comes to mind. While simple dresses are a popular choice for many weddings (as to not create too much of a distraction at the altar), the reality is that you have options. Patterns are a great way to add an interesting element to your group's attire, especially when paired alongside solid gowns. Our advice for coordinating this type of look is to start by finding a pattern you truly love. From there, you can use the colors within that pattern to determine what shades your solid dresses will be.

If you're more of a maximalist and you're not afraid to take risks when it comes to style, you might consider having each of your bridesmaids sport a different printed gown.

Whether you decide to go with sparse florals, gingham or even swiss dot, this method is one of the best ways to let your bridesmaids showcase their personalities.

## Can Mismatched Bridesmaid Dresses Ever Go Wrong?

Adding variation between bridesmaid dresses is a great way to elevate your wedding party's attire, however, too much variation can lead to your group looking uncoordinated. One of the most important things to remember when shopping for mismatched wedding party dresses is that less is more. Try varying just one or two things about each dress in order to keep some level of coordination. For example, you could opt for dresses in the same color that have different silhouettes, or you could try mixing and matching printed and solid-colored gowns while still sticking to the same color palette. According to Boswell, the best way to avoid mismatched bridesmaids dresses gone wrong is to oversee everyone's picks. "Creating a moodboard, ordering swatches and even picking out some pre-approved styles is a great way to provide some guidance and cohesion while still allowing personal tastes to shine through," she says.
