Terrific hotel in a great location. We were greatly aided with our meeting details by Marsha Augustine and her sidekick Kseniia. The did a great job on organizing our meeting room and meals. Rooms were very nice and location is a 10 because it ...

is convenient to highways and also in the middle of shopping. Great recommendations on a bus service and restaurants. We will definitely stay here again on our next trip.

We stayed in the VIP King Suite room for a week. The room was spacious and well equipped. Only complaint is that the room soon needs a deep clean. The upholstered furniture is pretty dirty and the shower is ready for some bleach. Other than ...

that the room was great. We really enjoyed watching the dogs in the dog park from our balcony. Parking in the garage was easy and the staff were very friendly.

Overall, an ok stay, but too many issues to be worth staying again. Front desk was nice, but the room itself was mediocre with multiple problems. First and foremost, the floors are super thin. If you're a light sleeper, forget about it. You h...

ear (and even feel) the upstairs guest each time they walked around, moved a chair, etc. A/C did not work when we arrived. Maintenance tried a couple things and eventually got it to at least turn on, but even after being fixed, it was very weak (the room would heat up by 5 degrees each afternoon even with curtains shut). I can't imagine staying here on a hot day--it was only 75 outside at its peak, but due to direct sunlight, it heated up like a greenhouse. The room was decently clean until you look closely. The window sills were filthy and under couches had trash left from previous guests. The pool is small but the hot tub is pretty big. Both were clean and got nice sun during the middle of the day. Walking distance to multiple restaurants and grocery stores.

My room was disappointingly dirty — the floor was covered in crumbs, cracker pieces, and dirt. Some of the towels were threadbare and stained. There was only one garbage can in the room, oddly hidden under the desk, which was inconvenient when ...

using the bathroom. No pen or paper was provided, and when I asked the front desk, they seemed confused and eventually handed me a sheet of printer paper. It feels like management is trying to cut costs wherever possible. The front desk staff were unfriendly and never smiled; they acted as though checking me in was a bother. On a positive note, the lobby restaurant’s breakfast was tasty, though the staff hovered and tried to clear my plate multiple times while I was still eating—likely because it was nearing the end of breakfast service. The hotel itself has a lot going for it: the rooms and lobby are modern, well-appointed, and very quiet. The food was good, and the location is excellent. I paid for a one-bedroom suite and was genuinely impressed by its size and design—definitely worth the cost. However, despite my World of Hyatt Explorist status, I didn’t receive any upgrade, supposedly because the hotel was sold out (though it didn’t seem very busy). Overall, this Hyatt Centric has great potential, but management needs to stop cutting corners. Raise rates if necessary—but it’s already quite expensive, even for the area.

We stayed at the Hyatt over the weekend. They charged us a $20 parking fee to park in their gated parking lot. That's all fine except our car was hit in the parking lot. No cameras, nothing to really help us to identify who hit our car. They ga...

ve us the building management's number to pass us off to someone else, but that's about it. And of course, no one could help us. This totally ruined our whole experience. We basically paid a fee to get our car hit and raise our insurance all in a private parking lot.
