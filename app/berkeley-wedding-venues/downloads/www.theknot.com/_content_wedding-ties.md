To tie or not to tie, that is the question. Choosing a tie for a wedding—or opting to go without a tie—can be a daunting process. Whether you're the groom, a groomsman or a wedding guest, there are certain rules when it comes to [wedding dress codes](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-guest-attire-cheat-sheet) that dictate whether or not a tie is needed. From knowing what kind of tie to wear, where to buy a tie, and [how to tie a tie](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-to-tie-a-tie), there are quite a few points to consider when looking into tie etiquette. To help guide the process, we spoke to Michelle Kohanzo, president at [The Tie Bar](https://tiebar.sjv.io/c/64733/1974071/24176?subId1=TK-wedding-ties&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thetiebar.com), for her expert insight on wedding tie etiquette. From whether or not a tie is necessary to the best places to shop for ties, we've outlined everything you need to know about men's wedding ties.

**In this article:**

  * FAQ About Choosing a Tie for Wedding Guests & Grooms
  * Where to Buy Wedding Ties



## FAQ About Choosing a Tie for Wedding Guests & Grooms 

Understanding when wedding ties are needed and the [types of ties](https://www.theknot.com/content/types-of-ties) can be confusing, but don't worry, we're here to help! Below, we've answered some commonly asked questions about ties that will help inform your wedding attire. 

### Do I have to wear a tie for a wedding?

When deciding whether to wear a tie to a wedding, whether as the groom or a guest, it all ties back to the dress code. A [wedding dress code for guys](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-dress-code-for-guys) is a bit more structured than those for women, and usually directly addresses whether a tie should be worn. Take [black-tie](https://www.theknot.com/content/what-to-wear-black-tie) optional, which literally notes that wearing a bow tie is optional. You may also choose to wear a suit and forgo a tie altogether for weddings that have a more casual or [semi-formal](https://www.theknot.com/content/what-to-wear-semi-formal) dress code.

"The answer really depends on how formal the event is; a beach wedding may be very laid-back with ties optional, whereas a black-tie event requires a tie," Kohanzo explains. "A tie is always traditional for both the groom and guests. With the tie trending again amongst the current fashion set, there is no better time to knot up."

### Should I wear a tie or bow tie to a wedding?

A common dilemma for wedding guests is deciding between a tie and a bow tie. Traditionally, a bow tie is worn with a tuxedo for more formal events, such as black-tie or white-tie wedding dress codes, though you can also opt for a bow tie for less formal weddings if that is what aligns best with your personal style. If you're really stumped, it doesn't hurt to reach out to the bride or groom and ask for further clarification on the dress code. 

"A bow tie is typically reserved for more formal events, but can also make a style statement in a more laid-back ensemble," Kohanzo says. "Wearing a beautiful black-tie with a tuxedo is a beautiful modern alternative. Menswear dress codes of late really encourage healthy style experimentation and aren't as rigid. When in doubt, opt for personal preference and ask a friend or the groom for a second opinion."

### What kind of tie should a groom wear?

Traditionally, the [groom and groomsmen](https://www.theknot.com/content/fashion-rules-for-grooms) wear ties to the wedding, no matter the dress code. "It is traditional for the groom to wear a tie that complements the colors of the bride's bouquet and/or the colors of the wedding party," Kohanzo shares. "For a less formal look, it is fun to play with a small pattern, maybe in floral. Accessories are a fun way to add a pop of color or pattern without going overboard. Don't be afraid to have fun with it! For a formal event, black-tie or very formal, white is best."

### What are the best tie colors to wear to weddings?

While you can never go wrong with a classic black or navy blue tie, we suggest leaning into the colors of the season when choosing men's wedding neckties and [suit colors](https://www.theknot.com/content/colorful-mens-suits-tuxedos) for a fun pop of color in your wedding guest look. If you're bringing a date to the wedding, it's also a great idea to coordinate a color scheme—it'll look amazing in all your photos! 

"For spring and summer weddings, soft palettes in blush, butter or pale blue are lovely. In the fall and winter, jewel tones are a beautiful choice, think burgundy, hunter green and deep marigold," Kohanzo offers. "Butter is having a huge red-carpet moment as well; it's definitely a color we've been seeing trend for us across the board."

### What is the proper tuxedo and tie etiquette?

When deciding on [what to wear to a wedding](https://www.theknot.com/content/what-to-wear-to-a-wedding), men will have to choose between a [tuxedo versus a suit](https://www.theknot.com/content/tuxedo-vs-suit). Again, this all comes down to the wedding dress code. A tuxedo is typically worn only for black-tie and white-tie weddings. A tuxedo is much more formal than a suit, and is often made with satin detailing and accessorized with a bow tie and cummerbund. Tuxedos are also worn with a specific kind of tuxedo dress shirt that differs from your typical button-down. A suit is less formal, but is more versatile and can be worn for most wedding dress codes and formal events. A suit can be dressed down for various events, while a tuxedo is reserved for special occasions, which is why men typically choose to rent a tuxedo. 

"Traditionally, a tuxedo is worn with a bow tie, but more and more grooms are opting for a beautiful black silk tie, as a modern twist on a classic look," Kohanzo shares. "Again, use your best judgment, but don't be afraid to take risks as well; there is no better way to feel special in your formal look."

## Where to Buy Wedding Ties
