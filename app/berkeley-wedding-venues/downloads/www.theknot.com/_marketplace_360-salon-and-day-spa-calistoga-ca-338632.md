I had my hair done by Kyla, the salon owner. She's done my hair for years and was the only one I trusted with my wedding day hair. She did a great job, my hair lasted ALL DAY, and ...

so did my bridesmaids' hair. I even took a video of my hair around midnight because it basically looked the same as the morning. She even swooped in when we had a groomsman hair "emergency" and helped with a hairstyle gone wrong. Kyla is great, she is well-priced in the valley, and so down to earth. Cannot recommend her services enough. I included some photos from our styling trial as well, since the shots are easier to see the hair.

My wedding party and I went to Salon 360 for our wedding hairstyles. My matron of honor and I also had our make-up done. There was a bit of confusion with getting appointments set ...

up, which was probably due to the fact that I was having trials done there, as well as mani's and pedi's on top of the things we had the day of the wedding. They got it all straightened out and everything went so great! Kyla, my hairstylist, did an excellent job on putting my hair up in a way that I was very happy with and she did it super quickly, too! Also, my make-up artist did exactly what I wanted the first time around. They were all very responsive and worked hard to please all of us. We were all happy with the outcomes and our hair stayed in place all day! Everyone working at the salon had happy and relaxing attitudes, which was perfect for the morning of my wedding. I was very relaxed when I left. They are also reasonably priced. I definitely recommend Salon 360.

The girls at Salon 360 did such a great job with my bridal party, I would recommend them to anyone planning their day in Napa! I went to them for my test run two days prior, then ...

on the day of the wedding the whole group of 3 girls came to us. Two girls did hair, while one did make up on my bridal party of four, and my mom. The hair and make-up looked great, and the girls were so fun to get ready with. They really contributed to the excitement of the day and were very sweet. A lot of places who do this kind of thing charge by the hour, or fraction thereof, and can get very expensive if you're not completely sure of your getting-ready schedule (and who is?!), but Salon 360 charged a la carte, so no matter how all over the place we were, we weren't penalized with upcharges, etc. They were great!
