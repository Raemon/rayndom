There are so many options for the perfect wedding hairstyle that settling on just one can feel like a challenge.

Half-up bridal hair allows you to pull back some of your hair so that it's not in your face all night long, while still giving you the chance to show off those gorgeous locks.

  * 45 Half-Up Wedding Hairstyles To Show Your Stylist
  * How to Choose a Half-Up, Half-Down Wedding Hairstyle



## 45 Half-Up Wedding Hairstyles To Show Your Stylist 

Half-up, half-down hairstyles are a versatile option that can be done with any hair length or type, whether you have lots of curls, pin-straight locks, tons of volume or rows of braids. When [choosing a wedding hairstyle](https://www.theknot.com/content/choosing-a-wedding-day-hairstyle), consider whether you want it to be elaborate or more casual. Embellishments like sparkling headpieces or dainty flowers make the look more interesting, while different types of braids are a great way to add texture and an overall boho-chic vibe. Look for inspirational photos based on what you like and the [latest bridal hair](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-hair-trends) trends. 

### 1\. Half-Up With Real Flowers 

![Half-Up With Real Flowers](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/d8c386e6-399b-4e6c-a3c6-4eb77e5f3553~rs_768.h-cr_0.333.2000.3000)

_[Photographer: James Rubio Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/james-rubio-photography-hilo-hi-345229),__[Hair: Indigo Grace Artistry](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/indigo-grace-artistry-kailua-kona-hi-987743)_

You can make your half-up, half-down hairstyle more unique by adding real flowers as embellishment. This is whimsical and so pretty, and you can use blooms that coordinate with the bouquets and floral arrangements. Weave them into a twist or braid and pin them into place for the day. 

### 2\. A Hair Clip in the Back 

![A Hair Clip in the Back](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/6da65a78-7eb3-49ed-8cea-602ee3f5ebb5~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1333.1777)

_[Photographer: Bo Shim](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/bo-shim-new-york-ny-980553),__[Hair: Beauty on Location](https://beautyonlocationnj.com/)_

This type of hairstyle gives you the chance to switch things up with your hair accessory. Instead of adding the clip to the top or front of your head, add it to the back, right underneath a loose braid crown or twist. This half-up wedding hair is unexpected, looks beautiful in pictures, and doesn't overwhelm your look. 

### 3\. Loose Tendrils Around the Face 

![Loose Tendrils Around the Face](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/c62c8d46-f1b0-4956-8c45-ba63e73d1acb~rs_768.h-cr_0.10.2000.2677)

_[Photographer: RTFaith Photography](https://rtfaithphotography.com/),__[Hair: Off White Makeup and Beauty](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/off-white-makeup-and-beauty-seattle-wa-346458)_

Make your half-up wedding hair more romantic by leaving some hair in loose tendrils around the face. This gives the style a softer look and is especially nice with loose waves or curls. It can also be a bit more casual depending on how loose you keep it. 

### 4\. Half-Up Ponytail 

![Half-Up Ponytail](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/8fcdc95b-e764-4bb3-a751-a2b2b3bbf8e3~rs_768.h-cr_0.50.1066.1471)

_[Photographer: 515 Photo Co](https://515photoco.com/),__[Hair: Dorka Jones](https://dorkajones.com/)_

Opt for sleek, modern and trendy with this slicked-back half-up ponytail. Instead of a loose, soft look, this one features some hair pulled tightly back into a semi-high ponytail, with hair wrapped around the elastic for a more formal look. Add some curls, keep flyaways at bay, and turn front pieces into a side-swept look to complete it. 

### 5\. Half-Updo With a Crown

![Half-Updo With a Crown](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/ff474ab6-e57a-4dd7-870e-17e9a77237aa~rs_768.h-cr_0.22.1810.2435)

_[Photographer: Sposto Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/sposto-photography-signal-hill-ca-620447),__[Hair: Meleah and Co. Makeup | Hair | Da](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/meleah-and-co-makeup-%7C-hair-%7C-da-san-diego-ca-241194)_

Go for all-out princess vibes by adding a tiara or crown to your wedding day look. You can do curls or waves and a classic half-up, half-down hairstyle, then [ask your hairstylist](https://www.theknot.com/content/questions-to-ask-your-hairstylist) to tuck the tiara into your hair for the finishing touch. 

### 6\. Boho Braid Crown

![Boho Braid Crown](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/358f9501-6bd2-45d3-91e3-b0bc87dae3b3~rs_768.h-cr_0.114.1365.1934)

_[Photographer: C. Hope Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/c-hope-photography-macon-ga-571964),__Hair: Christina Dedo_

One of the best ways to pull off a braid crown without looking too over-the-top boho is to do it with a half-up hairstyle. Pull only some of the hair back into a braid that wraps around the back of your head, and leave the rest in waves or curls. It's easy, beautiful and so versatile. 

### 7\. Romantic Twist With Flowers

![Romantic Twist With Flowers](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/b462fcde-dfad-4bfd-851f-9ed19a62bcee~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1333.1000)

_Photographer: Divya Pande,__[Hair: Ardone Artistry](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/adorne-artistry-houston-tx-253802)_

Pull your hair back into a half-up hairstyle by gently twisting two to three pieces that end up looking almost stacked on top of each other. This results in a soft, romantic hairstyle that looks lovely on its own, and even better when you add some flowers. These can be real or artificial clips, but bonus points if they complement your bouquet. 

### 8\. Half-Up With Glittery Clip 

![Half-Up With Glittery Clip](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/1c713fc0-ef1b-4dff-89ae-2dbeefeea715~rs_768.h-cr_0.527.3840.5647)

_[Photography: Rachel Red Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/rachel-red-photography-charleston-sc-877572),__Hair: Ananda Hair Salon_

An easy way to take your half-up, half-down hairstyle from simple to more exciting is to add a sparkling hair clip to one side. This is still a classic bridal look, but it just adds a little something that makes your look stand out.

### 9\. Half-Updo With Fishtail Braid Crown

![Half-Updo With Fishtail Braid Crown](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/3146ec0f-6dce-4a54-9af5-90367985b891~rs_768.h-cr_0.36.1334.1815)

_Photographer: Shane and Lauren Photography,__[Hair: Kelly Jones Makeup and Hair](https://kellyjomakeupandhair.com/)_

A fishtail braid crown looks intricate and so cool, and if you leave it soft and a little undone, it results in a gorgeous and slightly more casual half-up and down hair for a wedding. You can do it as a half-crown like this, adding loose waves throughout to complete the vibe. 

### 10\. Half French Braid Crown

![Half French Braid Crown](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/be642a0e-337c-41ab-b934-fa342ea2ff3b~rs_768.h-cr_0.119.2000.2786)

_[Photographer: Greta Tucker Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/greta-tucker-photography-westbrook-me-562526),__Hair: Shades with Prithvi_

This half-braid crown has to be one of the best ways to incorporate French braids into your [wedding hairstyle](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-hairstyles-you-will-love). The front of your hair is braided to the back, while the rest falls in soft waves or curls. 

### Find your kind of venue

From barns to ballrooms, discover reception venues that feel like you.

### 11\. Double Small Braids 

![Double Small Braids](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/52e9cf89-42ea-482a-9902-ac1e1c074846~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1760.2347)

_Photographer: Josh Gruetzmacher Photography_

Small braids might be trendy, but they are still a classic, and they look really bridal and beautiful when pulled back into a half-updo. You can do some small braids into the half-up style to add texture and interest to an otherwise simple look. 

### 12\. Wildflower Laced Half-Up Hairstyle

![Wildflower Laced Half-Up Hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/8d064a13-299e-406a-9b60-764ab373a0e1~rs_768.h-cr_0.337.4912.6886)

_[Photographer: Yellow Feather Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/yellow-feather-photography-salida-co-525737)_

Perfect for an outdoor spring or summer wedding, this half-up, half-down wedding hairstyle features an intricate twisted half-updo and gorgeous wildflowers. Lace them throughout the updo to make them look more natural and boho-chic. This is a great choice for [medium-length hair](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-hairstyles-medium-hair).

### 13\. Romantic and Curled Half-Updo

![Romantic and Curled Half-Updo](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/f59d7b77-5c8d-4810-958e-b9621b4e21ce~rs_768.h-cr_0.106.3000.4106)

_[Photographer: Jaimee Morse](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/jaimee-morse-portland-me-609607),__Hair: Viva Voce Salon_

This half-updo is an absolute classic. Start by doing barrel curls throughout your hair to achieve those soft, glamorous curls that look so bridal. Then, pull back some of your hair and add a pretty clip to secure it, adding a subtle touch of embellishment. This is so versatile and works well with almost any gown or wedding. 

### 14\. Loose and Boho Half-Updo

![Loose and Boho Half-Updo](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/1d87c64e-570e-465c-96ec-b2f5648e0cad~rs_768.h-cr_0.26.2096.2821)

_[Photographer: Lauren Peele](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/lauren-peele-dallas-tx-985054)_

If you're looking for a more casual wedding hairstyle, then opt for these loose waves. Instead of pulling back a large section of hair, just pull back a few pieces for a more undone, effortlessly cool style. 

### 15\. Twisted Half Crown

![Twisted Half Crown](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/c6d61cce-ade9-4a99-a0a4-51e39f33dde9~rs_768.h-cr_316.0.3729.2560)

_[Photographer: Stacy Hart Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/stacy-hart-photography-dover-de-438037)_

This is a cool take on a braid crown: instead of a braid, it's a twist. One of the keys to making this work is to keep it just a little bit tighter so that it doesn't fall apart immediately. This is also a good way to pull off a sleek half-up look: keep your hair shiny and smooth, either straight or wavy. 

### 16\. Braided Half-Updo With Unique Embellishments

![Braided Half-Updo With Unique Embellishments](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/a45dd398-e84b-42ec-9aec-a5e3be4a3f74~rs_768.h-cr_0.167.2000.2834)

_[Photographer: Anastasiia Photography](https://anastasiiaphotography.com/),__[Hair: Sara Tamargo Makeup and Hair](https://www.saratamargo.com/)_

Don't be afraid to have fun with your hairstyle—this is your wedding day, after all! You can opt for a half-braid crown and long, loose waves, and then you can make it feel more like you with unique embellishments. In this case, flowers and butterfly clips make this feel so different and special. 

### 17\. Sleek and Straight Half-Updo

![Sleek and Straight Half-Updo](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/7e94a3c7-c73e-4d51-8d28-12d9a582d9cb~rs_768.h-cr_0.48.3000.4048)

_[Photographer: Tamara Gruner Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/tamara-gruner-photography-highlands-ranch-co-848912),__Hair: Reiman Condron Beauty_

A lot of half-up, half-down hairstyles include soft curls and waves, giving a slightly undone vibe. But you can also achieve this look with straight hair—the outcome is sleek, smooth and so sophisticated.

### 18\. Loose and Curled Half-Updo

![Loose and Curled Half-Updo](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/5835ea02-0d0c-4196-bcea-805c3091c319~rs_768.h-cr_0.250.3000.4250)

_[Photographer: Cloud Craft Wedding Films](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/cloud-craft-wedding-films-austin-tx-1058801),__[Hair: LUX Beauty & Bridal](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/lux-beauty-and-bridal-austin-tx-2006391)_

The opposite of sleek and straight is loose and curled, and it works just as well for a classic, elegant bridal hairstyle. You can opt for brushed-out curls or long, loose waves, and leave some face-framing pieces out for a more romantic look. 

### 19\. Half-High Ponytail

![Half-High Ponytail](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/30bf4503-8cab-48a1-9aae-fde9bc2d0318~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1079.1439)

_[Photographer: Jordan Maunder Photography](https://jordanmaunder.com/)_

A half-high ponytail is cute, fun and playful, so it's perfect for wedding celebrations or a slightly more casual wedding vibe. You can curl the rest of your hair for the texture and volume, and add a cylindrical holder like this one to really get the ponytail to pop. 

### 20\. Glamorous Curled Half-Updo

![Glamorous Curled Half-Updo](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/7ada2d17-24e3-43c9-b309-bbba06fd5a6c~rs_768.h-cr_0.90.1080.1530)

_[Photographer: Ivy Weddings](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/ivy-weddings-dallas-tx-427778)_

If you want to keep things simple, opt for a [curly wedding hairstyle](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-hairstyles-for-curly-hair) like this one. Curl all of your hair, then brush through the curls to make them a bit softer. Pull half of your hair back loosely, leave some face-framing tendrils out and tease for a little volume, and you're ready to go. 

### 21\. Beach Waves With Half-Updo

![Beach Waves With Half-Updo](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/ed902a55-1b38-4c7e-891b-b4d93312644d~rs_768.h-cr_0.250.3000.4250)

_[Photographer: Daniela Ortiz Photography](https://www.danielaortizphoto.com/),__[Hair: Blanc Bridal Salon](https://blancbridalsalon.com/)_

The tousled texture of these beach waves makes your half-updo look a bit more casual and lived-in, and it's perfect for a seaside or daytime wedding in a destination location. It's simple and low-maintenance, and since you want it just a bit messy (in a good way), you don't have to stress over it throughout the day. 

### 22\. Half-Loose Waterfall Braid Crown

![Half-Loose Waterfall Braid Crown](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/2cd3e355-2e56-4291-8fec-0b36d9760035~rs_768.h-cr_0.133.1600.2266)

_[Photographer: The Snells](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/the-snells-dalton-ga-963717),__[Hair: The Style by Lori](https://www.facebook.com/TheStylebyLori/)_

Both elegant and fun, this hairstyle features a loose braid crown and an embellished hair accessory. You can do a waterfall braid crown and then pull at each section to give it a fuller feel, so it doesn't look too tight or sleek. Add a sparkling clip along the braid for a little something extra.

If you want to keep things simple and minimalist, this is the perfect hairstyle for you. Start by doing a deep side part, then pull your hair back into a half-updo and secure it with a nice clip. It's so pretty and unexpected. 

### 26\. Half-Updo With Flower Crown

![Half-Updo With Flower Crown](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/109d3ff3-e6b5-46c1-82e3-b5e6be72d615~rs_768.h-cr_0.182.1094.1641)

_[Photographer: Sweetwater Portraits](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/sweetwater-portraits-philadelphia-pa-256306)_

Go for the ultimate boho chic look: a flower crown that sits right on top of your hairstyle. This looks especially great when paired with a half-up, half-down hairstyle like this one. Very loose curls and softly pulling your hair back add to the effortless vibe. 

### 27\. Half-Up Wavy Hairstyle 

![Half-Up Wavy Hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/845d8fe7-bd37-4902-9202-870c740acd82~rs_768.h-cr_0.111.1333.1888)

_[Photographer: B Hull Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/b-hull-photography-yonkers-ny-549319),__Hair: Gallery Salon_

This half-up hairstyle is a nice mix of sleek and romantic. You can pull hair back tightly for a neat look, and then leave the rest of it more carefree and undone. Achieve this by brushing out waves and adding texturizing spray for a less messy beachy look. 

### 28\. Half-Up Hairstyle With Bangs

![Half-Up Hairstyle With Bangs](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/82e0c890-58d5-4be9-a051-ddbf2654c7cb~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1000.1333)

_[Photographer: Callie Hobbs Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/callie-hobbs-photography-denver-co-763698)_

One of the things about half-up, half-down hairstyles that we love is how versatile they are—they even look great with shorter bangs. This look is a great example: You can leave your bangs down and pull back the rest of your hair into a half-updo. Add a sparkly hairpiece for something special. 

### 29\. Pulled Back Half-Updo With No Part

![Pulled Back Half-Updo With No Part](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/999c4642-21a3-488c-89c5-78073590078d~rs_768.h-cr_0.189.2267.3212)

_Photographer: Captivated Photography,__Hair: Bliss Studio_

Many half-updos incorporate either a side or middle part, but this is a reminder that you can also pull back your hair without any part at all. This looks a bit more classic and romantic, and it also gives you the chance to add a lot of volume. 

### 30\. Short and Curled Half-Updo

![Short and Curled Half-Updo](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/055dc8b4-4c26-4b16-9ce1-7c3fb7d12205~rs_768.h-cr_483.0.4295.2859)

A half-updo is an excellent [short wedding hairstyle](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-hairstyles-short-hair) option. In this look, simply pull back some hair, leave face-framing strands, and curl the rest for something polished and classic. 

### 31\. Tight Half-Braid Crown 

![Tight Half-Braid Crown](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/6b8f7458-2a99-4d20-9683-a6d1b441fe6c~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.2800.3733)

_Photographer: Sara Joy Photography,__Hair: J Gregory Salon_

Many half-braid crowns tend to be loose and very soft, but if you're looking for something sleek and put together, opt for tighter braids. This look uses multiple small and tightly wound braids around the back of the head to create an interesting contrast against loose curls. 

### 32\. Knotted Half-Updo

![Knotted Half-Updo](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/e5d6d3f8-2a98-491d-8a78-079cf032206b~rs_768.h-cr_0.320.3840.5440)

_[Photographer: Koby Brown Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/koby-brown-photography-galveston-tx-563650)_

This knotted half-updo is hard to resist if your wedding feels nautical-inspired or takes place during the summer by the water. It's interesting and unique, and this one is really in the shape of a Celtic knot, which is a nice homage to Irish or Scottish heritage. 

### 33\. Side-Swept Half-Updo

![Side-Swept Half-Updo](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/18cb22bb-73a5-4994-9c7b-6008846f6969~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.2840.3787)

_Photographer: Katie Lewis Photography,__Hair: ADAE Salon_

Glamorous and classic, this side-swept half-updo is gorgeous, especially with a piece like this brown fur stole. It looks like it's meant to be on a Hollywood red carpet! Keep the updo soft, show off some earrings and go for loose curls. 

### 34\. Loose and Wavy Half-Updo

![Loose and wavy half-updo](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/8f977ed0-de07-4589-9007-014debcd3645~rs_768.h-cr_0.95.1667.2318)

_[Photographer: Brett Matthews Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/brett-matthews-photography-roslyn-heights-ny-293166),__Hair: Andrew Deep_

This wavy, half-up, half-down wedding hairstyle is simple and subtle, but it's also gorgeous and so romantic. Brush out your curls for old-fashioned-inspired waves and only pull back a little bit of hair to keep it low-key. 

### 35\. Classic Bridal Hairstyle

![Classic Bridal Hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/88a6b43e-5793-4cd3-adb0-5598aacb856e~rs_768.h-cr_0.213.2560.3626)

_Photographer: Robert Godridge Photography_

There is something traditionally bridal about this classic half-up, half-down hairstyle. It features a little volume, soft tendrils around the face and romantic barrel curls, and it's lovely as [wedding hair with a veil](https://www.theknot.com/content/long-hairstyles-with-veils). 

### 36\. Half-Up Bun Hairstyle

![ Half-Up Bun Hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/1213cdf4-a099-4508-9ef1-2d8687a939fc~rs_768.h-cr_0.17.1080.1457)

_[Photographer: Lisa Blume Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/lisa-blume-photography-chicago-il-230428),__[Hair: DC Elite Image](https://dceliteimage.com/)_

This is truly a half-updo: Pull some of your hair back into a tight braid crown, then wind it around into a half-up bun. When sitting toward the lower crown of your head rather than on top of your head, it looks much more formal. 

### 37\. Romantic Wavy Half-Updo

![Romantic wavy half-updo](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/32f5c337-c032-4475-a65b-9699b38f97bf~rs_768.h-cr_0.254.3000.4254)

_[Photographer: Banga Studios](https://www.bangastudios.ca/),__[Hair: Megan Naik](https://www.instagram.com/megannaik_)_

This half-up hairstyle is perfect for brides with long hair. Brush out curls to get a gentle wavy look and pull some hair back, leaving a few tendrils out in front. It's simple but beautiful and really shows off your hair. 

### 38\. Half-Updo With Hair Out in Front

![Half-Updo With Hair Out in Front](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/466fe49e-98d1-4b6f-90c1-9ae79c6cec61~rs_768.h-cr_0.116.2560.3529)

_Photographer: Our Story Creative,__Hair: Color by Maica_

This relaxed half-updo is an excellent choice for the laid-back bride who wants something bohemian but also wants to keep things really simple. Leave a good chunk of your hair out in front, then pull just a few pieces back at the crown of your head. 

### 39\. Half-Ponytail With Natural Texture

![Half-Ponytail With Natural Texture](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/1d90fbac-8d1e-4ced-8540-ecd8c4ff58cf~rs_768.h-cr_0.266.1600.2399)

_Photographer: Angel Patricia Photo_

There's no reason to hide the natural texture of your hair on your wedding day. Instead, use it to create a gorgeous curly half-up, half-down style like this one. Natural curls look so pretty when pulled into a simple half ponytail, and you can add some small sparkly clips if you want. 

### 40\. Elegant Half-Updo

![Elegant Half-Updo](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/4da74728-4ecd-449b-b53b-51637759c841~rs_768.h-cr_0.320.3840.5440)

This classic half-updo is beautifully simple. Start with a smooth blowout and some soft curls at the ends, then pull hair into a careful half-updo with just a little volume. This pairs so nicely with a traditional bridal gown as well. 

### 41\. Cute Half-Ponytail 

![Cute Half-Ponytail](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/63d034a2-b55f-4731-8ff8-6554319c1780~rs_768.h-cr_0.250.3000.4250)

_[Photographer: Divine Day Photography](https://www.divineday.uk/)_

This sleek and bouncy half ponytail feels trendy and cool in a way that isn't trying too hard. Leave some face-framing tendrils out, but make sure the pony is pulled back tightly. The rest of your hair can fall in loose waves for a nice contrast. 

### 42\. Retro-Inspired Half-Updo

![Retro-Inspired Half-Updo](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/a7fc398d-1175-4e21-ad53-371eae432b20~rs_768.h-cr_6.0.3739.2800)

_[Photographer: Jillian Bowes Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/jillian-bowes-photography-grand-rapids-mi-520927),__Hair: Otto Grand_

If your wedding is giving retro or vintage vibes, then you need a hairstyle that works with that. This half-updo, which features plenty of volume, has a '50s or '60s vibe that pairs perfectly with bright red lipstick. 

### 43\. Half-Updo With Elaborate Hair Clip

![Half-Updo With Elaborate Hair Clip](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/7a790c8e-e620-4b15-ac2f-2c3c3c470235~rs_768.h-cr_0.185.2186.3100)

_[Photographer: Cindy Lee Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/cindy-lee-photography-ballwin-mo-415643),__Hair: Stephanie Kruchowski_

The easiest way to make your half-up look stand out is to add a really beautiful and unique hair clip. Something more elaborate, like something very sparkly or something like this floral look, is perfect. 

### 44\. Half-Waterfall Braid

![Half-Waterfall Braid](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/b81f291f-41d7-43b3-bbc1-8e4b7dc03e10~rs_768.h-cr_197.0.3346.2362)

_Photographer: VRAI Photography_

A boho waterfall braid is unique and fun, and it's perfect for a half-updo look. Opt for a more casual vibe by keeping hair in very loose waves for just a little texture. You can also add small flowers in the braid if that matches the vibe of the wedding. 

### 45\. Tons of Volume 

![Tons of Volume](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/ae8a20a4-000d-4de8-971a-753569fa1b60~rs_768.h-cr_94.0.1066.729)

_[Photographer: Riverbend Studio](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/riverbend-studio-chicago-il-155609),__Hair: Perfect Hair Anywhere_

If you don't want your hair to look flat in any way, opt for lots of volume. It's pretty easy to achieve this with a half-up, half-down hairstyle. Keep the rest of your hair in traditional curls and add a long veil for more bridal drama (in a good way). 

## How to Choose a Half-Up, Half-Down Wedding Hairstyle 

Finding the best half-up, half-down hairstyle for your wedding means looking for something that will keep you comfortable and feeling your best. You want something that looks great in person and in pictures, but you also don't want your hair to be bothering you all night. Keep the following considerations in mind when finding your inspiration photos. 

### Note Your Hair Length and Texture

Half-up, half-down hairstyles are versatile enough to be used with short, long, curly or thin hair. That said, picking a specific style for your [hair type](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-hair-type-tips) is still important. If you have long hair, you might want to opt for long loose waves or curls, or incorporate a braid halo or crown into your look. If your hair is short, consider something a little simpler that doesn't require help from extensions. If you have beautiful natural curls, work with that texture to create a stunning result. 

### Think About Bridal Hair Accessories You Want to Include

Thinking of adding a [bridal hair accessory](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-hair-accessories), like a sparkling hair clip or pretty wildflowers? These go great with a half-up, half-down wedding hairstyle. Opt for something with a braid or fishtail braid to weave flowers into. If you're adding a hair clip, keep the rest of the hairstyle simple so that it doesn't feel like there's too much going on.

### Consider the Location of the Wedding

The where and when of your wedding affect your hair. If you're getting married by the beach, consider that the salty air or wind may mess with a sleek hairdo. Work with that type of atmosphere by opting for something loose and purposefully mussed up, like beach waves or a braid. If your wedding is quite formal or has a black-tie dress code, you may want something more put-together, like a half-up bun or a classic and sleek half-updo. 

### Keep Comfort in Mind

Comfort is key on your wedding day. A very tight half-up, half-down hairstyle might make you want to rip your hair out after a few hours. Something too tousled might end up looking a little too messy by the end of a long night of dancing. Think about how long you'll be rocking the look and your comfort level.

### Book a Hair Trial

Once you pick a half-up, half-down wedding hairstyle you love, be sure to try it out during your hair trial with your professional hair stylist (which you can find on [The Knot Vendor Marketplace](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/beauty-services)) and leave it in for several hours. Take a bunch of photos and videos, show them to your closest friends, and maybe even try on your wedding dress while you're rocking it. This is the best way to see how it will sit over time, how you like it in photos and how comfortable it feels.
