When it comes to beach weddings, comfort is key. Thankfully, when you find a dress with these features, it'll be _smooth sailing_.

### Lightweight Fabric

Don't bury your head in the sand when it comes to the weather. When attending a beach wedding, especially during the summer, chances are you'll be encountering heat and humidity. The good news is that you can keep cool and comfortable by opting for a dress made from lightweight fabrics like linen, organza and chiffon.

### Breathable Silhouette

Perhaps more important than fabric choice is the type of silhouette you choose to sport on the beach. Walking on the sand is hard enough, and you may not want to do so in a form-fitting dress. A-line silhouettes are always a safe bet, but if you're attending a semi-formal event, we recommend opting for a short or midi-length dress.

### Short or Sheer Sleeves

If sleeveless isn't your style, don't worry. Short flutter sleeves and even long sheer sleeves are great options for keeping cool in the summer heat. They're also non-restrictive, meaning your arms will be free for dancing the night away at the reception.
