I was definitely not the type of bride that dreamt of her wedding since childhood. But I knew what I wanted and liked, and my husband let me run with it. We live in San Jose and we...

were having our wedding in Santa Rosa. I spent weeks reaching out to florists and most were not available during mid-June, which is when our wedding took place. But one of them connected me with Tina at SoCo, and I will forever be grateful. Tina was quick to respond and even made herself available for a call the same day. She was great at asking open ended questions (not assuming), was incredibly patient, and kept things light and fun. She also has a contagious laugh, which was a great reminder to enjoy the process. We were so lucky Tina was available for our wedding. One thing I knew I wanted was white flowers coming out of the ground, down the aisle. Tina thoroughly understood the vision. She was in constant communication with my planner and the venue. Because our venue, a winery, was not OK with things getting stuck into the ground (which is fair), Tina came up with a Plan A, B, and C. She ran everything by me and told me she’d make something happen. I trusted her and at that point (closer to the wedding), I was quite frankly over making decisions lol. On the day of the wedding I arrived and was blown away by Tina’s work. Our venue itself is gorgeous but her flowers really made everything come together and gave our big day the romantic feel and look I was hoping for. Honestly, her flowers are my favorite memory from our wedding day. Another thing I want to make sure to note, is that both Tina and I were set on not being wasteful and wanted to repurpose as much as possible. The gorgeous meadows she designed, we ended up using for our cake cutting, sweetheart table, and our dance floor. She was kind enough to also decorate our cake so exquisitely. Mine and my MOHs bouquets were out of this world and our table center pieces were so elegant. She made sure that all the folks I had listed got their boutonnieres and corsages (which were also perfect) on time. She stayed back at the end of the night to organize and make sure our family and friends took the center pieces with them. This was perfect because we did not have wedding favors and her center pieces were better than any favors we could’ve come up with. All in all, Tina was an absolute angel and delight to work with. She was communicative, supportive, kind, and everything I’d hope for in a wedding vendor. Beyond her kind spirit, her designs and work are out of a dream and in my opinion, worthy of a feature in Vogue. She will forever have a special place in my heart and in the memories of our wedding.

ed in planning my own wedding and Tina's passion, energy, and expertise gave me confidence that the arrangements would be beautiful and they were. I loved my bouquet and all the arrangements, they brought such joy and happiness to our day. We used our florals at our brunch the next day and as they were still so beautiful and after I found a local hospice and was able to donate our florals hoping they would bring the same joy I felt. Thank you so much to Tina and the team at SoCo In Bloom.

t be happier with how everything turned out. From the very beginning, Tina was kind, communicative, and incredibly thoughtful in helping bring our floral vision to life. Every arrangement — from the bouquets and boutonnières to the ceremony arch and reception décor — was stunning. The flowers were fresh, vibrant, and perfectly captured the romantic, elegant look we were going for. So many of our guests complimented the florals! Tina truly went above and beyond, not just in her artistry but in her care and professionalism throughout the planning process. She made everything feel seamless, and we felt fully supported and confident in her expertise. We’re so grateful for her role in making our day feel magical. If you’re looking for a talented and reliable florist with a heart of gold, look no further than SoCo In Bloom. Highly recommend! — Chin & Shawn

id the flowers for my wedding, she completely outdid herself!! My bouquet was, hands down, the most beautiful thing I have ever seen! The head table arrangements looked like they were straight out of a fairytale—lush, romantic, and absolutely breathtaking. Every detail was perfect, from the color palette to the delicate floral combinations that tied everything together so seamlessly. Tina’s passion and artistry truly shine through in her work, and she is such a joy to work with. She listened to my vision and somehow made it even better than I ever imagined. I have been married for 3 years now and I will tell you that one of the main things you think about when you reminisc on your special day, is the flowers. Every single time I smell a fresh cut hydrangea, rose or eucalyptus branch I am transormed right back to the magic of our wedding. If you’re looking for a florist who will bring your floral dreams to life, SoCo in Bloom is the place to go. I will forever be grateful for the magic Tina created on my special day!

of service and customer care, and the beauty of the floral arrangements that she created for my son's wedding at the Sea Ranch. Without hesitation, Tina responded to last minute changes we asked her to make and she was able to decorate the ceremony location beautifully despite the fact that the bride and groom did not make a final decision about where it would be held until the morning of the wedding. I unreservedly recommend Tina for any occasion if you are looking for both exceptional quality and a wonderful florist to work with.
