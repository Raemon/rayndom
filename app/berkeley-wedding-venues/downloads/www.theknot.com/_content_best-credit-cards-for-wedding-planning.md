## Can You Pay Wedding Vendors With a Credit Card?

Yes, many [wedding vendors](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace), from venues to wedding dress designers, accept credit cards as a form of payment. As you're [asking wedding vendors questions](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-questions-you-didnt-know-to-ask) before booking, make sure to inquire about how payment works. Some vendors may be able to directly take credit card payments while others may process those charges through third-party billing systems, such as [Rock Paper Coin](https://rockpapercoin.com/), [Honeybook](https://www.honeybook.com/) or [Maroo](https://www.maroo.us/). Additionally, it will vary from vendor to vendor on whether a fee is applied for paying with a credit card instead of a check or wire transfer. 

## How to Choose Credit Cards for Wedding Expenses 

Here's the thing, do wedding vendors and venues accept credit cards? Often, yes. However, does that mean you need to pay via credit card? Not necessarily. When evaluating your [wedding budget breakdown](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-budget-ways-to-save-money) and weighing if a credit card is the best form of payment, you need to consider the decision mindfully. 

### Consider Your Overall Financial Situation 

While you can use credit cards to pay for wedding vendors, Sara Rathner advises that you do so mindfully and only if using that form of payment works within your broader financial situation. "Credit cards are merely a tool you can use to pay for things in a strategic way," emphasizes the financial expert. "You can use them to earn rewards on money you were going to spend anyway, and that helps make every dollar spent work a bit harder for you. Or you can use them as a short-term, interest-free loan." 

The pro goes on to note that anyone [who pays for a wedding](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-budget-who-pays-for-what) with a credit card "need to be thoughtful whenever you're spending a lot of money in a short period of time. Credit cards aren't going to set your wedding budget for you. Even if they allow you to take on no-interest debt, it's up to you to pay that debt down as aggressively as you can. So, yes, a $5,000 credit card limit is technically money you can use for wedding expenses, but be cautious about spending more than you can afford to pay back." 

### Understand the Credit Card's Rewards Structure 

"If you're able to fund your wedding without taking on debt, this opens up some possibilities for lucrative rewards cards," says Rathner. While selecting the best credit card for the wedding, Erin Lowry explains that "there are three common types of reward structures" to be cognitive of. 

  * **The Sign-On Bonus:** With this kind of reward, "you get miles or points after you spend a certain amount of money," says Lowry. This could prove useful when planning your honeymoon or a destination wedding. Rathner is a fan of these rewards, especially ahead of major vendor payments. "A few weeks before a big deposit is due could be a good time to apply for a new card with a generous sign-up bonus, because that one large expense can help you reach the spending minimum required to get that bonus. When I got married in 2015, we did just that to put down a catering deposit," says Rathner. "That helped make our honeymoon in Maui more affordable"
  * **The Flat-Rate Cash Back:** "You get a certain percentage of cash back every time you make a purchase," explains Lowry of a flar-rate cash back reward structure. If you're early in the wedding planning process, this could be a strong option, especially when making larger purchases.
  * **Rotating Categories:** Credit cards with this type of rewards give you "a small percentage of cash back every time you make a purchase, usually 1%. And then increased cash back in different categories each quarterly," says Lowry. If you're flexible with your spending, rotating categories may be a great choice for you!



### Look for Interest-Free Credit Cards 

"If you need to spread out payments for those big-ticket wedding purchases, a credit card with a 0% APR promotion can give you at least a year to make payments interest-free," explains Rathner. However, the pro warns that there are a few important considerations with zero-interest credit card offers. First, "you may not qualify for a credit limit high enough to put really big charges on the card." Additionally, once the no-interest promotional period ends, "you'll begin to owe interest on any remaining balance. If you use a credit card to finance part of your wedding, you want to go into this with a plan to pay it all off," advises Rathner. 

### Prioritize Balance 

Credit card companies try to make it as easy and enticing as possible to sign up, but that can be a slippery slope into opening more cards that is wise for your financial situation. "The number of cards you use for wedding purchases depends on how many cards you feel comfortable managing at once," says Rathner. "The moment you struggle to keep up with payment due dates is the moment you need to scale back. It's perfectly fine to pick one card, like a travel card with a sign-up bonus that earns points on your spending. Or you can use two or more cards if you're spending enough to earn more than one sign-up bonus." 

### Don't Change Your Regular Spending Habits 

Lowry advises, "Your goal should be to match a credit card to your regular spending instead of changing your patterns for a specific credit card." She also gives sound advice when it comes to considering a credit card with an amazing rate — but a steep annual charge. "Many reward cards can come with annual fees that can give you a bit of sticker shock." She cautions reward-seekers to look at a credit card from every angle to see if it will fit best into your lifestyle and budget.

### Be Strategic With Timing

Choosing the right credit card goes hand-in-hand with picking a wedding date and a venue. Make it one of the first things you and your partner discuss when you first begin to plan your dream day. If you plan to apply for a new credit card, do so a few weeks before you make any deposits so you have the card available when you need it. 

## Choosing the Best Credit Cards for Wedding Planning
