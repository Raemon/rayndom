Rod was great to work with and was very helpful in the planning process. He was great with listening to our vision providing advice and filling in the gaps, e.g. their own playlist...

My husband and I were so happy we hired Rod for our wedding back in May! He is incredibly organized, hands-on, and friendly, which made the entertainment planning process so simple...

for us. My husband is extremely picky about music (his Do Not Play list was infamously 5 hours long…) and Rod worked really well with him to put together the best playlists. One of our guests was a wedding planner herself and commented on how impressed she was by our DJ in particular. The music was always right on queue, never too loud or quiet, well mixed, always matching the energy at the moment, etc. - all things she said she rarely sees done flawlessly throughout the day. We’ve had so many compliments on the music and particularly on how incredible the dance floor was! The energy he helped curate was pure magic, and we could not have been more thrilled with how it all turned out. We also chose to do a photo booth and it was such a hit with our guests. Athelie and their son did a great job and provided lots of fun prompts for everyone! Overall, we were so impressed with the Grapevine team and couldn’t be happier with the decision to work with them.

DJ Rod kept the dance floor packed all night! Working with him and Athelie throughout the planning process was very smooth. They do a great job of following your vision and request...

s on the things you care about while also providing advice and filling in the gaps, e.g. their own playlists for cocktail hour and dinner. Rod knows how to make everything run very smoothly at Vine Hill House and did a great job on each component of the wedding sound, music, and emceeing. During the dancing, he kept the party moving and mixed our songs with other great picks. We would highly recommend Grapevine!

We had a wonderful experience working with Rod and his team on our wedding in early October of 2023. I (last minute) asked Rod to help edit the song I danced to with my dad, and he...

NAILED it!! (Thanks Rod, sorry for the last minute request). Music was REALLY important to me, and Rod was able to sift through my playlists and curate the perfect soundtrack to our day. We also added on the photobooth which we are SO happy we did! They supplied props, a backdrop and everyone was able to put in their phone #s so they could have their silly photobooth photos on their phone instantly. It was perfect. If you're looking for the perfect wedding DJ with a photobooth add on, this is the place for you!

We hired Rod to DJ our Sonoma County wedding. He was so personable and always available when we had questions. He was extremely helpful in guiding us through the process and giving...

advice for how many songs you need for each part of the wedding and what works and what doesn't. He helped quell any nerves that we had leading up to the wedding. He was very adept at accommodating all our needs from a pianist at cocktail hour and a live singer during our ceremony and a mix of music for an older crowd and hip hop for our friends. On the day of, he was an amazing MC, very friendly and kept the vibe high. Once the dance party started, our guests never left the dance floor and neither did we. The music selections and transitions were perfect and majorly added to the energy all night. We highly recommend him! A++++!!!

DJ Rod brought the party! He played everything we asked for and nothing from our "do not play" list. If we didn't have to turn the music off at 10, I think we all could have danced...

all night!

i first have to say that rod was AMAZING. he was so professional, incredibly easy to work with, so nice, and listened to us when we said what we wanted. the show was not about hi...

m, he made it about us and played the music we wanted and knew exactly when to play it. he had great ideas for music selections, but didn't get offended if we turned down his ideas. great music was a must for me for the reception, he did not let me down, or the guests! he had the dance floor going all night long. my husband and i love country music, and he incorporated fun country songs perfectly without playing too much for the guests who don't prefer it. he started out with awesome music to get all ages, young and old on the dance floor to get the party started and finished off the night with more modern pop music for the younger crowd that continued to dance the night away, myself included! and he offers a Photo Booth. it was a hit! everyone loved it and now we have a nice photo album that he gave us with all of the photo strips and sweet messages from out guests. besides the awesome service, he is insanely affordable. i would definitely recommend rod at grapevine. we are so happy we went with him, he made our night the perfect party to celebrate us!

Rod was fabulous. We were hesitant about hiring a DJ because we didn't want the reception to feel like a high school prom. Rod was very professional, did just the right amount of...

directing to keep things moving, was very personable, and was super flexible about changing music selections to match the mood of the crowd. We thought he was terrific!
