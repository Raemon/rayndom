My husband and I got married in June 2025, and it was such an honor to have Ms. Young and her team as our wedding florist. They did an AMAZING job, and made the whole process so sm...

ooth. When we first contacted Ms. Young, we had no idea what kind of floral decorations we wanted, what kinds of centerpieces were out there, etc. And Ms. Young walked us through that process, showed us some inspo arrangements and examples, and helped us narrow down to what kind of style we wanted for our wedding (the floral color scheme, bud vases for rectangular tables, the floral arch style, etc). As our wedding date approached, if we wanted to make changes to the floral color scheme, they were so flexible to accommodate our request. We also had an open wedding, so we were constantly re-evaluating our guest list and # of tables (and floral centerpieces we needed) - and they were so kind enough to be accommodating to any changes that happened on our end. We also didn't have an official wedding venue (we used our church courtyard), so we had no idea how to make use of the space we were given and where to put the sweetheart table and the guest tables - and Ms. Young offered her professional opinion on where the tables would look best and most aesthetically pleasing. This helped our reception layout a lot! The day of the wedding, the florals turned out so beautiful!! They helped us work within our budget to make our dream wedding reception come true. We are so grateful to have had Ms. Young and her team as our wedding florist!

I with such compassion and were helpful every step of the way. I was worried about going over my budget, but they did everything they could to bring my vision to life. During our meetings, I provided pictures of my inspiration, and they took over from there which was very nice, especially during a time that can be stressful. When I walked into my wedding venue and seen the amazing job they did, my heart was filled with joy to witness such beauty. They truly are experts! Annie and Young, I can't thank you both enough! God bless you.

I recently had the pleasure of working with Events by Young Florist for both a corporate event and my wedding, and I cannot speak highly enough of their exceptional service. I firs...

t decided to collaborate with them for my wedding after seeing the incredible work they did for my company. Their attention to detail, creativity, and ability to bring visions to life was evident from the start. For my wedding, they completely exceeded all expectations. They created a cohesive floral design that was absolutely stunning and became the true highlight of the entire event. The florals tied everything together beautifully, making the space feel like a dream. Their professionalism and talent shine through in every arrangement, and I couldn't have asked for a better experience working with them. Beyond their incredible work, the team at Events by Young Florist is a joy to collaborate with—both professionally and personally. They are kind, approachable, and truly invested in making your event as perfect as possible. I will absolutely use their services again for future events, and I highly recommend them to anyone looking for flawless florals and top-notch service. Thank you so much for making my wedding day truly unforgettable!

ad to change our arch floral design two days before our wedding day. Despite the rainy day, Young prepared two arch designs (indoor and outdoor) for us in case we could do our ceremony outside. She was very thoughtful and talented. I almost cried when I walked down the aisle and saw how beautiful it was. It turned out so beautiful and everyone complimented me about florals. I highly recommend Young as a professional florist. Just trust her! She has such good taste, you will definitely like it.

I highly, highly recommend Annie, Young and their team to take care of all your floral needs. They unequivocally and significantly exceeded our expectations in every aspect, includ...

ing but not limited to the final implementation of our dream design (the floral arrangements were stunning and gorgeous), professionalism, flexibility, and price. Young and her team were extremely professional, talented, and easy to work with. I had a particular vision with many specific details/elements that I wished to include and Young was able to bring my specific design and color scheme to life. She was extremely easy to work with and met all of my particular wishes, providing guidance when needed but otherwise receptive to and accommodating of all of my creative input. Initially I was a little worried because I was planning and coordinating my wedding in another state, but they were extremely responsive and easy to communicate with. Many of the other florists I reached out to took multiple days to reply, but Young always replied in a timely manner, which really put me at ease. Another extremely important piece to wedding florals is pricing. Young and Annie’s fantastic work is extremely reasonably priced, definitely on the lower end when compared to the other quotes we received. Young and her team were very flexible and made our vision come true according to our budget - we felt that we did not sacrifice any quality and did not lose out on even the slightest bit of our wedding florals vision, yet we met our price point. Ultimately, we were extremely happy and satisfied with the floral arrangements done by Young and her team. They helped make our dream wedding come true - their floral arrangements were stunning, they are the utmost professionals, and we could not be more eager to recommend Young and her team to other engaged couples.

When I first reached out, Kay was very responsive and helped me figure out the cost for my two day events (ceremony & reception). My mom and I met with Kay and Young at their studi...

o and saw the styles and items that could be used in the events. We were very happy with their ideas as we wanted sunflowers/rustic theme for the ceremony and romantic/subtle for the reception. Young was amazing for using Paris Hilton's wedding theme incorporated in mine (with a much smaller budget compared to Hilton's hehe). Ceremony day, they did amazing with the flowers, the theme, the decor. I was so in love with everything. As for the reception, it was their first time designing for an indian-pakistani reception where there is a main stage. They focused more on the decor and flowers and did amazing. I personally preferred the ceremony day since that was very unique and not a known theme used in weddings. Their prices are similar to other places but their quality of work made up for that price. I was very pleased and everyone kept complimenting their work. I had a great time meeting with them and definitely recommend them for beautiful weddings.

Young truly made my wedding look so magical with her floral design - she exceeded all of my expectations and made our venue look like an absolute dream! I also had her prepare my b...

ridal bouquet, bridesmaids bouquets, groom & groomsmen boutonnieres, and mothers' corsages, which all perfectly enhanced what everyone was wearing and brought cohesion to the wedding party. As a shorter bride I asked her for a petite bridal bouquet and she executed it perfectly. She also created a dreamy arch for our ceremony and sweetheart table, and created the most unique and thoughtful centerpieces for each table. Our venue was a pretty blank white warehouse, but her flowers filled it up perfectly and made it feel warm and intimate. I kept getting so many compliments on our wedding colors and flowers. She took my very simple vision and listened carefully, but also went above and beyond - my jaw dropped when I walked into the venue for the first time on my wedding day because she made it look even better than I could have ever imagined. Young and her team are incredibly experienced and know how to use florals to enhance any type of venue - she's the one who recommended taller centerpieces due to our venue's high ceilings, and those ended up being my favorite element of our wedding decorations. I didn't want anything too extravagant, but looking back at my wedding photos I'm so glad that I had a florist as talented as her to make all the memories and moments look extra beautiful. She's also extremely responsive and was easy, kind, and pleasant to work with throughout the whole planning process. Just a tip, prepare a Pinterest board or gather as many photo references as possible to best help you communicate your vision! If you are looking for a wedding florist, look no further!!! HIGHLY recommend Events By Young to make all your wedding day flower and decor dreams come true :)!!!!!! PS- She also has a lot of additional items that are available to rent which ended up being SO helpful when i needed picture frames, easels, table numbers, signs, and other things last-minute.

Young and Reya did a phenomenal job with the flowers and decor for my wedding! They listened attentively to my ideas and were very kind, professional women. They were able to take ...

inspiration/pictures I had saved from Pinterest and turned them into reality. The flowers, arrangements, and decor they provided were beautiful and exceptionally high quality. They held up throughout the entire wedding day and looked beautiful for days after taking them home! During the planning phase, they were very accommodating of my schedule and so easy to work with. I was able to meet at their design studio and see all that they had to offer in person, which I absolutely loved—it made things so much easier to visualize. They made sure every single detail was covered. Young and Reya provided all of the flowers and decor on time and did a beautiful job setting up at the venue. They worked so hard and I didn’t have to think or worry about the flowers at all on my wedding day—everything was where it needed to be, when it needed to be. They responded extremely quickly to my emails and calls, which made working with them a breeze. You cannot go wrong working with these ladies for your wedding. I cannot recommend them highly enough!
