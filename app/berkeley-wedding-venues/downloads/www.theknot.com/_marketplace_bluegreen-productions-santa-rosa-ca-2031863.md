Joshua CRUSHED it. Literally, cannot thank him enough. We had a last-minute (like week before) cancelation of our "live guitar/singing" and I called him and told him what was going...

on and we worked together on a resolution. He was also able to accommodate 4 set-ups for my event, luckily he carries all the equipment with him or we probably would've been screwed! He was awesome, took requests for dancing, and was also able to do a custom song for my husband and me which was a Jason Mraz song mashed up with an Indian song. All-around super awesome to work with and very organized, punctual, and friendly! 10/10 would hire him again!

Josh was easy to work with from the very beginning. My husband and I had our ceremony and reception at my in-law's backyard -- he was accommodating and met us a few days before the...

event to help plan things out. He made his job look seamless even though I totally messed up in not providing a list of announcements for him (sorry!). He went with the flow and made it a fun/inviting environment for everyone. We danced all night and had the time of our lives! Thank you so much Josh for your fun energy!

e it fun for everyone (ages 3 to 83). A lot of DJs cannot cater to their environment or the various ages of the party. Not Josh - the party was a huge success because of Joshua.
