r was a saxophone player and he would’ve loved to see these gentlemen perform. Not only is their music sense and taste incredible, but their overall energy and attentiveness to adapting to our audience at the wedding reception was unmatched. We absolutely recommend them and pray you take the time to read this and see how great our experience was and don’t hesitate to book them for your next event. 🙏

It was an absolute pleasure having Magnolia Jazz Band perform at our wedding. They created the perfect atmosphere during our ceremony, cocktail hour, and dinner - we couldn't have ...

asked for anything better. Their professionalism and musicality is unmatched and we would hire them again in a heartbeat. Robbie was a breeze to work with during the lead-up, being highly communicative, and guiding us through the sometimes daunting task of choosing the vibe we wanted during the event. The playlist of songs Robbie provided helped us curate what mood we wanted, Robbie gave some additional song suggestions when we got stuck, and the band was even able to learn a specific song that we requested. During the wedding we got so many complements from our guests about how much they loved the band, and we couldn't agree more. Thank you Magnolia Jazz Band for making our special day that much more special!

pecial requests which they were able to accommodate, even though most were not traditional Jazz songs. They played Scottish traditional music for our procession, and several Beatles hits. They even played the Pizza Parlour theme from Club Penguin, which lit up the face of the bride and groom as it was an in joke for them. They played the dance music superbly, and even stuck around for a couple of encore extra dances at the end of the evening. I would highly recommend hiring them for any sort of intimate wedding or garden gathering.

ut a month ago, and I got dinner with a friend last night, and she brought them up again! We had them play at our reception. They graciously arranged The Swan for their group (a favorite of my mother in law's) for the groom/mother dance and did a lovely job during our first dances. They brought the fun! People danced. People mingled. They added to the vibe perfectly.

d another reason to hire them again! Our wedding guests raved about how good they were, and continued to talk about them after our wedding day. Robbie was so communicative and helpful, and definitely knew his stuff! He did a great job of both taking our requests and offering helpful suggestions. He was able to help us pick songs for the ceremony, and we picked songs off of the band’s set list for the special dances. Other than that, we entrusted him to pick music to set the elegant, upbeat tone for the day and he did a great job. It was also very easy to work with him on logistics for moving between the patio for the reception and the porch for the ceremony (pictured). I would recommend the Magnolia Jazz Band to anyone looking for jazz music for their event. They were upbeat, fun, and incredibly responsive - I can't say enough good things.

If I could give Magnolia Jazz Band more than a 5 star review, I would in heartbeat!! We booked them for our wedding reception on 12/9/23 at the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco, and...

it was one of the best wedding decisions we made! From the moment I stumbled upon their website and Robbie's YouTube channel, I knew they were the perfect match for our occasion. Robbie and the band were easy to work with, replied promptly to all our questions, and showed us such kindness and professionalism during the planning process. On the day of our 4+ hour event, their upbeat and elegant music truly set the tone for our special day. We gave them full autonomy and trust in their music selection and let me tell you- they did not disappoint! It was everything I dreamed of and more! Our family and friends absolutely loved the vibe the band gave us and are still raving about them weeks after our wedding! I highly recommend the Magnolia Jazz Band to anyone who is thinking about booking live, jazz music for any event. I'm already looking for an excuse to party plan and book them again myself! We can't thank Robbie and the band enough. Their music was truly a highlight of our special day and I can't wait to make more memories together in the future!

waiting for the photos from the photographer, and finally, I'm able to post the review now. I've scrolled through Robbie's posts on IG and was very moved by his passion for music performing. We exchanged a few chats, and Robbie was super sweet and accommodating of our requests. My hubby and I had a few unconventional songs in mind and the way Magnolia Jazz Band arranged the songs made the day even more special for us! Their website has a song list so you can get an idea of what songs or vibes you'd like for the event. We had the band performing for the ceremony, cocktail hour, and a little of the reception for 3 hours. Our guests had been raving about the band and we loved the vibe that the band gave us. I can't thank the band and Robbie enough for pulling off an amazing performance to make our wedding day so unique, memorable, and special. I highly recommend the Magnolia Jazz Band to anyone who is thinking about getting a jazz band for any event.

ss, responsiveness, and capability were evident in all of our interactions leading up to our big day! Robbie took the time to ask the right questions in order to determine the mood we wanted to set for the wedding - which, through his help, we determined to be upbeat and romantic. Robbie did a great job of both taking our requests and offering helpful suggestions. On our wedding day, the band showed up well ahead of time, well prepared, and played incredibly well! Their timing, of when they played everything they played, was impeccable. They learned songs that we requested - including the processional and a few other songs for the reception - and it was obvious there was a lot of preparation that went on behind the scenes leading up to the event. We are still having guests comment on how they loved the music and the atmosphere that the band created. We can't wait to create another event...even if it's not a wedding :) ... just to have a good excuse to book them again! Thanks Robbie and Magnolia Jazz Band!

my request! To say they go above and beyond is an understatement.

l the more special. Also, it was really easy working with Robbie in the months leading up to our wedding. Communication was smooth and Robbie often checked in on us to ensure that we had everything we needed to prepare for the big day. As for communicating our musical preferences, it was as easy as creating a Spotify playlist that contained a bunch of jazz songs that we enjoy listening to and sharing it with Robbie. The band did their best to play as many of our requested songs as possible on the wedding day. We also appreciate the band's flexibility. We had them play for two hours — the first hour outdoors in the cocktail hour area and the next hour indoors for dinner. The trio was more than willing to work around our timeline and accommodate our request. We are truly grateful that Magnolia Jazz Band made our wedding celebration an unforgettable one with their music. We highly recommend them for your special celebration as well.

their quality. Robbie reached out immediately upon contacting them, and maintained consistent communication throughout the whole process (which is a godsend when trying to organize all the moving pieces that eventually become a wedding). They were able to accommodate two requests for songs and did phenomenal jobs writing arrangements for both. Their upbeat presentation was perfect for the mood we were trying to create.

Adding an elegant ambience, and playing all the first dance, father-daughter, and mother-groom dance songs wonderfully. I HIGHLY recommend the Magnolia Jazz Band!

hour and they were incredibly talented, always professional, and just lovely human beings. There was great communication before the event as Robbie checked in with us to understand what vibe we were trying to create. He and the band offered a great range (from Jazz and Bossa Nova to Hip Hop) but also were always open to learning new songs if needed. They made our wedding feel even more elevated and warm. And the bonus is that they are very reasonably priced. We are already thinking of what event we could plan for the near future so we can book Magnolia Jazz Band again.
