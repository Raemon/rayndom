One of the late-night snacks the happy couple offered their guests were large peanut butter cups. To elevate this classic candy for their formal wedding, they requested a gold leaf be on each peanut butter cup. This is a perfect example of how you can take any dessert item and make it fit your wedding.

### 3\. Marshmallow Pops

Handheld foods will always be fan favorites at weddings since some guests like food that doesn't leave them stuck at a table. Give your desserts the handheld treatment with marshmallow pops. These delicious wedding desserts were dipped in chocolate and rolled in graham crackers, also known as deconstructed s'mores.

### 8\. Chocolate Dipped Fortune Cookies

![Fortune cookie dipped in chocolate and purple sprinkles. ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/c7ca42b0-e2e6-4032-b27c-713ee68a049e~rs_768.h-cr_0.110.1335.1890)

_[Photography: Emily Wren Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/emily-wren-photography-philadelphia-pa-595214)_




At this glamorous wedding, the couple had multiple sophisticated desserts instead of one wedding cake. We think the black velvet bow at the bottom of the tower is the perfect touch to this elegant wedding dessert showpiece.

A fondue fountain station is a fun and tasty way to include sweet and savory snacks at your dessert table. Ensure you have someone overseeing the station if [kids will be at your wedding](https://www.theknot.com/content/the-kids-stay-in-the-picture) since it can get messy without parent or adult supervision.

### 35\. Field Hockey-Inspired Rice Krispies Treats

To show their love for Alabama and their alma mater, the bride and groom not only held their wedding at the University of Alabama's sports stadium, they also hinted at it in their dessert. The field hockey-inspired Rice Krispie Treats had the couple's player number they wore while attending the University of Alabama.

### 36\. Chocolate Oreo Display

Want a croquembouche-style dessert without the pastry puffs? Try it with doughnut holes with varying flavors to surprise your guests.

## Mini Wedding Dessert Ideas

### 40\. Boozy Tiny Doughnuts

![Plate of elegant mini donuts. ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/26d7af9a-2cd0-4a35-a7e0-753ebd41540a~rs_768.h-cr_0.111.1333.1888)

_[Photography: Red Gallery Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/red-gallery-photography-westerville-oh-333975),__[Catering: Brewnuts Donuts & Beer](https://www.brewnutscleveland.com/)_




"When you get married on a Tuesday, you'd better send people home with breakfast for the next day. When you get married on St. Patrick's Day, you'd better have a boozy dessert," the bride jokes about their mini boozy doughnuts. If you want an alcohol-infused dessert at your wedding, properly labeled so parents can ensure their kids don't mistakenly eat one.

### 41\. Petite Chocolate Milkshakes and Chocolate Chip Cookies

![Tray of milkshakes topped with chocolate chip cookies. ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/c1f21867-6d14-4ed5-bdf8-73798b3a6d84~rs_768.h-cr_0.90.1080.1530)

_[Photography: Meg Cooper Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/meg-cooper-photography-minneapolis-mn-432159)_




Dessert shooters are popular at many events and celebrations. Almost any sweet treat can be made into a shooter, which makes it a great option for couples who want handheld food items at their wedding.

### 43\. Small Fruit Tarts

![Mini tarts topped with fresh fruit. ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/1b48bf47-1f47-4318-b58f-90fcec98a5a0~rs_768.h-cr_0.111.1333.1888)

_Photography: Mon Petit Studio,__[Catering: The Wicked Sweet Sugar Boutique](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/the-wicked-sweet-sugar-boutique-tampa-fl-971280)_




For a quick and easy dining experience for your guests, offer bite-size wedding desserts. Let your guests fill up on anything from small fruit tarts to mini cheesecakes.

### 44\. Bite-Size Cannolis

![Tray of mini cannolis dusted with powdered sugar. ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/4f62c07f-5fbb-4ed9-b63c-1baaed573d49~rs_768.h-cr_0.140.1333.1917)

_[Photography: Stephanie Tudin Photography](https://www.stephanietudin.com/),__Catering: Valentina's Sweets_




If you want another dessert in addition to your cake, consider a miniature version of the second dessert. The bride and groom served decadent cannoli dusted with powdered sugar alongside their white wedding cake.

## Frozen Wedding Dessert Ideas

For couples having weddings during the warm seasons, serving something refreshing or cooling is key, especially if it's an [outdoor wedding](https://www.theknot.com/content/outdoor-wedding-planning-guide). Consider having one of these icy treats below at your wedding. 

### 45\. Signature Popsicles

![Couple holds colorful popsicles. ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/03a7362d-bd55-4940-9d0e-ca401a2ffc62~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1334.1779)

_[Photography: The Brauns](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/the-brauns-columbus-oh-360122),__[Catering: J-Pops](https://www.myjpops.com/)_




You've probably heard of [signature cocktails](https://www.theknot.com/content/your-ultimate-signature-cocktail-finder), but what about signature popsicles? Have a wedding dessert menu with your and your partner's respective popsicle flavors so your guests can choose their favorite.

### 46\. Soft-Serve Ice Cream

![Couple enjoys soft serve ice cream at their wedding. ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/a08cdb00-63cc-4ce5-9fe0-5f9f842024eb~rs_768.h-cr_0.50.1080.1490)

### 47\. Chocolate Taco Ice Cream

![Chocolate ice cream tacos displayed on ice. ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/c966f676-1501-4033-973a-48f50681081f~rs_768.h-cr_113.0.1888.1331)

_[Photography: Jessica Frey Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/jessica-frey-photography-austin-tx-557211)_




We love this creative frozen wedding dessert idea. The chocolate taco ice cream went with the couple's taco and tunes wedding theme.

### 48\. Colorful Ice Cream Sandwiches

![Mini ice cream sandwhiches in a variety of colors. ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/7abc5eb4-2bb3-45f9-aae5-fa0e4aeade12~rs_768.h-cr_153.0.1933.1335)

_[Photography: Two One Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/two-one-photography-denver-co-399916)_




These cute and eye-catching rainbow-sprinkled ice cream sandwiches were a big hit at the bride and groom's wedding. This kind of dessert is perfect for kids who love food with fun colors.

### 49\. Snow Cones

![Couple holds cups of colorful snow cones in hand. ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/fc60c5c0-d1f2-4165-b102-900fdb4bd081~rs_768.h-cr_0.1.2000.1501)

To go with their beach wedding, the couple hired a caterer to serve snow cones to their guests during the reception. This a great beach wedding dessert idea to cool your guests down in warm weather.

### 50\. Assorted Gelato

![Retro gelato truck at an outdoor wedding reception. ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/4b3ab5f9-f6e8-4532-8487-39d7e8a664fa~rs_768.h-cr_0.180.1080.1620)

If you want ice cream at your wedding, but want something slightly different, try gelato. Authentic gelato has more milk, less cream and typically doesn't use egg yolks as ice cream does.

### 51\. Frozen Custard

![Individual portions of frozen custard on ice. ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/390c05bc-74c2-407d-a8f7-a34ccefee45a~rs_768.h-cr_0.194.1333.1971)

### 52\. Sweetheart Ice Cream Cake

![Beautifully decorated ice cream cake adorned with fresh roses. ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/e7397b37-e59e-4def-9ee0-588a10ccf636~rs_768.h-cr_111.0.1888.1333)

You can totally offer your guests a multitude of dessert options but have a special dessert for just you and your partner. This bride and groom requested an ice cream cake as their sweetheart confection.

### 53\. Ice Cream Sundaes

![Newlyweds hold delicious individual ice-cream sundaes. ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/22d6a2f2-e564-4e46-9fa6-853a34ad780e~rs_768.h-cr_2.0.1022.1360)

To honor where they had their first date, the bride and groom hired the local ice cream shop Ted & Wally's to be their wedding dessert caterer. The couple made custom his and hers flavors for the ice cream sundaes.

## Simple Wedding Dessert Ideas

It never hurts or disappoints if you go back to the basics for your wedding dessert. Serve one of these simple and classic sweets on your special day that is guaranteed to satisfy. 

### 54\. Jordan Almonds

![Small bag of sugared almonds given as a favor to the wedding guests. ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/8a8591c8-94ae-48a3-82ec-f641ed07bcda~rs_768.h-cr_0.49.1333.1826)

_[Photography: Frances Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/frances-photography-denver-co-193769)_




[Jordan almonds](https://www.theknot.com/content/all-about-jordan-almonds) are a dessert wedding tradition that is rich in flavor and symbolism. Consider giving these as party favors to your guests, with an added warning about the candy's outer shell.

### 55\. Chocolate Chip Cookie Wedding Cake

![Chocolate chip cookie cake topped with fresh flowers. ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/94cbd7a8-60d5-4804-8dd3-b577d6e2d007~rs_768.h-cr_0.113.1330.1886)

If cake isn't your thing, consider having cookie cake instead. Choose any cookie flavor(s) that speaks to you and enjoy a dessert that's simple yet fun.

### 56\. Milk Chocolate Mousse

![Miniature glasses of milk chocolate mousse. ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/cb3331b1-d3d2-4ea0-b831-e598534e9fc0~rs_768.h-cr_0.223.1333.2000)

Every aspect of this couple's wedding was colorful and vibrant. To continue with their bright color scheme, the couple had pretzels sticks dipped in chocolate and rainbow sprinkles at the reception.

### 58\. Upscale S'mores

![Chef toasts a marshmallow to create a gourmet s'mores. ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/7634ea44-9f50-4f9b-b3cb-cb9c82bc151d~rs_768.h-cr_0.134.1334.1913)

_Photography: Mary Alice Hall,__[Catering: 1927 S'mores Company](https://www.1927smores.com/)_




We love the idea of serving s'mores at a wedding, especially if you're having a campfire at the reception. You can have a s'mores station for guests to make it themselves or have the catering staff make them if a campfire isn't allowed on your venue's property.

### 59\. Belgian Waffle à La Mode

![Belgian waffles served with a scoop of ice cream on top. ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/cdba2501-537c-486e-baed-2c7c607511b5~rs_768.h-cr_0.150.1333.1927)

_[Photography: She Wanders Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/she-wanders-photography-san-diego-ca-411422)_




The groom's grandmother had a no-bake cookie recipe the couple loved, so they used it as a wedding favor their guests could make. The milk bottles had all the ingredients needed and the instructions for the recipe on the back.

### 61\. Caramel Apples

![Caramel covered apples on a tray. ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/ab169192-bf86-4b8e-917f-de21488eb645~rs_768.h-cr_0.111.1333.1888)

![Tray of chocolate brownies with a white chocolate drizzle. ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/78d1a9e7-a60d-4d6c-b3b8-626baa013b79~rs_768.h-cr_113.0.1888.1331)

_[Photography: ByCherry Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/bycherry-photography-santa-barbara-ca-591566)_




Since the groom wasn't a fan of cake, they served fresh fruit, cookies and brownies. The brownies were made of fudge and had white and milk chocolate drizzle.

### 64\. Flan

![Plates of flan to be served at a wedding reception. ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/4419ac0d-a08a-431b-afda-18a06e85ed55~rs_768.h-cr_113.0.1888.1331)

Even though bundt cakes are still in the cake family, it's a simple way to make your wedding dessert different. Bundt cakes get their name from the type of pane they're baked in.

### 66\. Mini Banana Pudding Cups

![Mini cups of banana pudding. ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/f6b669d5-e952-459b-acfc-4d31cafe70eb~rs_768.h-cr_111.0.1888.1333)

_[Photography: Lyndsey Sullivan Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/lyndsey-sullivan-photography-little-rock-ar-528438)_




The bride wanted a special dessert for the groom but didn't want to have a [groom's cake](https://www.theknot.com/content/most-amazing-grooms-cakes). Instead, the bride asked their caterer to make mini banana pudding cups, the groom's favorite dessert.
