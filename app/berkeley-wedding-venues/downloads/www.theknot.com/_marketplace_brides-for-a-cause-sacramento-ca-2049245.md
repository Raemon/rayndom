dress that I did not expect to love. I saved so much money, and my dress was unworn! It was one a bride ordered and ended up not using. Everything is in beautiful shape, most donated directly from bridal shops. The people are really helpful, but let you peruse the rack and do your own thing. PLUS they support a ton of charities that help women, so double win!

sparkles, to lace, different shades of white/nude. The staff was so friendly and helpful. They were genuinely interested in what I thought about the dresses what I liked/didn’t like. They also ask questions about your big day to give you recommendations on dresses. I bought 2 that I couldn’t decide on because they were amazing!! $255 for both! ($150 for one, $75 for the other) highly recommend!!!!!

ing felt a little overwhelming. I like to do my own thing and time restraints can add to the stress. I needn't have worried. Taylor was simultaneously helpful (bustles can be confusing) and chill, offering the perfect combo of support as well as space for my mom, sister, and I do our own thing as I tried a great variety of dresses. We even went over the time limit being the only ones there, which wasn't an issue at all. We also had to postpone our appointment by 30 mins since travel time from Redding got delayed. Again, no issue there. The atmosphere was bright, comfortable, and cheerful. The time was fun, exciting, and giddy. And at the end of it all, I'm stoked my purchase not only participates in sustainable practices but supports other groups doing valuable work. And an originally $3,500 dress down to $800? That's a win-win-win scenario ◡̈

ses or help you try them on, as you would expect at a more traditional bridal salon. I didn't know this was how they operated when I first arrived at the store and candidly I was a bit shocked. Because the stock is donation based, there may not be a ton of options to search through. That said, the store was definitely worth visiting overall. Not only did I find my dress, but it was way more affordable than I could have hoped for AND I got a second mini-dress for my bachelorette!

n my size. I took my mom, sister and friend with me and we had a great time being able to dig through the dresses and try them on. The dressing room area is small and has multiple groups going on at once, but it made for a more communal vibe, and we all talked and tried on dresses together. So fun! The best part though was easily the value. I found a dress that was extremely close to what I was looking for less than $200, which would have easily been 10x that price if I had found it at a boutique. It needs some alterations but that is to be expected, and I feel so much better about the cost that the alterations because I was able to find it for such an affordable price. I highly recommend future brides stop here first when looking for their dress! There is a huge variety of styles and it's a great opportunity to try on a bunch of different styles to see what might work - you may be surprised!

I had such a nice experience here. The instructions are pretty clear. You can choose 5 dresses at a time and have 60 minutes. They have different types of dresses organized by size...

. I found a few that were all types of styles. They have fitting rooms and chairs. You can bring up to 3 people with you. I went through maybe 8-9 dresses and then found the dress I loved! Their styles go from 50-90% off. They gave me good suggestions for alterations if needed. The staff were very nice and the selection of the dresses was great! I highly recommend. I had such a cool experience here and loved the process. It was something more relaxed than a formal bridal dress experience and that's what I wanted. Highly recommend! The dress price was reasonable too. They have a range of prices from $150 to higher end prices as well.

I would absolutely recommend going to this shop if you're looking for a wedding dress! I went a total of 3 times (including their bride bash which everything was $150 to make room ...

for incoming inventory) before I found my dress for a extremely discounted price (about 80% off of the original price)! My only complaint is there is a lot of the very sequined and patterned dresses but I genuinely don't think it's the shops fault, it is just what is in trend right now in the wedding industry! Everyone there is so nice and the staff are always ready to help and to give you words of encouragement through your journey! Lots of size variety, bridesmaid dresses, veils, and capes too. Definitely worth checking out even if you think you won't find anything, this could help you work out what type of dresses you like! Some words of wisdom, don't go based on how it looks on the hanger. If it catches you eye, try it on you never know!

I ended up grabbing a few more (with the help of my consultant) for the last haul. Once I put MY dress on I just knew it was THE ONE! It is true that when you know it's your dress you just get that feeling. I'm so glad Brides for a Cause was there to make my experience wonderful and to find MY dress!!

dresses is bright and beautiful. She found the perfect dress and we saved SO much money. Weddings are expensive and this just freed up the budget for some other things we didn't think we could afford! :) Sizes below 8 and above 14 have a smaller selection to choose from only because they can only sell what is donated. But, we found hers outside the "most popular" range and the thing about buying a dress off the rack is that the alterations can be minimal. This saves you a ton as well! In our case, the dress only needs minor alterations to the corset back. The length is perfect and it is already bustled. A 10/10 experience all the way around!

Response from Brides for a Cause on 05/01/2024

Hello! Thank you for your feedback! We are unlike most bridal stores as we resell donated ...

inventory sourced from designers, bridal stores and individuals! Most of our dresses are floor samples from other stores! So they've been tried on at other salons and may come to us with a little wear. Pricing is reflected on the condition, so dresses are marked own further with any major damage. Everything is discounted 30-80% off! We're surprised to hear that you found most dresses to be highly worn. While some may need minor fixes, most are in great condition! If browsing our entire inventory, the majority of our dresses are current styles and great shape, as we accept gowns 5 years and newer to ensure the inventory offers newer styles! Perhaps there was just a handful of dresses in your size that happened to be a bit more damaged than usual. We're always getting new inventory in, so we encourage our brides to check back often! Thanks for shopping with us!

d up with the pretentious vibe. If you are looking for a classy yet friendly bridal shop then Brides for a Cause is a great place for you. The prices are very budget friendly and the quality is top-notch. I saw so many designer gowns that I had seen in previous shops but these were a fraction of the price. It was well organized so going through the racks was a breeze. Many of the gowns were unaltered so the length was still perfect for my tall frame. The staff were kind and encouraging but in no way pushy. You can tell they truly have dedicated their time and expertise to making the shop a great success. They are dedicated to the cause and super friendly. I would recommend any bride to go browse their racks before going to the high end stores. And if you are looking for a great way to give back, you can donate your dress to the shop after your event.

zation that was doing such great work. But I really thought I would have to sacrifice my ideal dress to make it work and that was not the case at all. I got one of their last available appointments while I was home in Portland for Christmas (I live in Chicago now) and I found my wedding dress with my best friend/MOH on Facetime giving me advice as I furiously tried them on. The dress was exactly what I wanted and it was originally $2,750 but I got it for $450, all of which went to support great causes. I cannot recommend Brides for a Cause more.

ull 5 stars is because the shopping experience was a bit hectic. It's hard to visualize what the dress will look like while it's on the rack, and there is no one to assist you besides the basic functions of checking-in/out and answering questions. It would have been impossible to shop here alone, as I needed a second set of hands to hold dresses I was pulling off the racks, zip me up, grab a veil, etc. That being said, I did find my dress here and I love it! They were able to hold the dress for me, while I left to do some soul-searching, and let me try it on again right at closing to make sure that Yes! It's the dress! The women that work there are extremely friendly and helpful, I just wish there was more of them to assist the brides. All-in-all a great experience, just make sure you bring a buddy to help you shop!

long), bridal separates (tops, skirts, pants), and accessories (veils, jewelry, hair pieces, shoes, etc.). Not only are we contributing to amazing causes, but also giving clothes a new life. Everything's so reasonable compared to going to retail stores and buying everything new. Scheduling is super easy whereyou can make appointments online. They were even willing to meet virtually to go over the items they had since Sacramento is a far drive from San Francisco. One of my favorite parts about their stores is how inclusive and organized their sizings are. I struggled to find my size 14 in bridal shops, but their store makes it so easy to find what you need. Highly recommend their store to anyone and everyone!

An overall great experience! Many dresses to choose from organized by size for an easier shopping experience. Great great prices and you can find any type of dress here (including ...

backless and current trends). Just know you have to clip yourself as you do not have a personal stylist, but they can help you if you need it!

I'm pretty sure I've already given this rant to every woman I've encountered in the past few months, but it deserves to be posted here too. I cannot say how happy I am with BFAC. ...

So many of my friends are paying thousands of dollars for their wedding dresses, which take months to be delivered. I spent an hour at BFAC and went home with my dream dress AND a veil, which only cost me $340. You're not going to get the "sipping champagne and shopping with 10 of your best girls" experience here. And if you have a very specific idea of what you want, there's a good chance that this shop won't have that exact dress. But it's definitely worthwhile to start here, to see what styles look best on you, and in case you get lucky like me and find a gorgeous lace dress with sheer paneling and a bodice that fits like it was made for you. Make sure to book an appointment online, and bring a friend or family member to help pick and try on dresses. The dresses are organized by size, which makes selecting dresses easy. The attendants were super helpful in using clips to show how the dress will fit once altered. And do make sure to leave room in your budget for alterations. Happy shopping, ladies :)

ples so you have a chance at getting a brand new dress. You have to keep in mind that the dresses can have flaws in them, but they are not flawed to the point where they are unwearable. I wish at least the samples were put in dress bags, but I can understand how that could slow the shopping process. Also, since we are shopping the racks ourselves, I think the appointments should be at least an hour and a half to give us time to look through the racks and try on. When I first got engaged, I knew this is where I wanted to shop, and I found my dress the first time around! It was a sample and a Lazaro! It is nothing like the dress I saw myself in, but it made me feel so much like a bride. Plus, it was a mix of champagne and blush, which matched my wedding colors perfectly

t the time. The price for dresses is better than anywhere and all the staff are very helpful and give suggestions on possible alterations for the dress you want. All dresses are available on the racks at the store, you shop your size, and can try up to 10 dresses on your visit. They have a great selection of wedding dresses (various sizes and good quality), veils, accessories, and bridesmaids dresses. They also have various sales, so try and visit during a sale if you can!
