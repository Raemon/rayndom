In our ever-evolving wedding plans, Isabella + Olivia have been patient with our specific needs, specific budget, and special requests (i.e. including my disdain of chicken breasts...

at weddings). We've found them prompt, congenial and honest when it's come to the realities of an ideal location for our wedding consisting of mostly out of town guests. Those perspectives have been critical in our process thus far. Additionally, we've worked with S&H on other personal events and the staff has been excellent, the food superb, and the details out of my periphery -- just as they should be.

We were really hopeful about Salt and Honey for our wedding of 68 in my parents’ backyard. From the first meeting Olivia (the owner) answered all our questions and created a menu t...

hat was farm to table with local fresh ingredients which we wanted. She ensured us that her and her team had ample experience with receptions in private homes. After we signed the contract with Olivia things changed - our first “tasting” (granted, during COVID) was food delivered in to go containers that had been sitting on a hot plate and portable fridge in a van on a hot day for over 2 hours while her FOH manager toured my parents’ house first. Nothing was hot or cold enough so it was difficult to figure out how the food would be for our wedding. When we asked to have a complete repeat tasting by Olivia she declined, only offering to redo specific items and said we could come to a location closer to her if we wanted the items hot. To her defense, the food was delicious when we tasted it at a park 15 minutes from her kitchen. A few months before the wedding we had another in person meeting with the new FOH manager at my parents’ property, Jessica (who we love.) Unfortunately she didn’t have a lot of the correct information from Olivia on what the company could and couldn’t provide. A week before the wedding, there were numerous email threads where Olivia had no idea about items needed for the wedding, such as asking for a tent rental for BOH and talking about flipping the ceremony and reception space cocktail hour items when there was only 1 location. She also asked for hundreds of dollars more in event rentals days before the wedding (which we ended up not needing most of it) and stood up our planner for meetings. It was an incredible amount of undue stress days before the wedding for us, my parents, and our wedding planner. The day of, none of the food was served hot. When we told Jessica (as Olivia wouldn’t speak to us directly), she said that she was sorry and dishes could be reheated. That said; the service staff were attentive and the bartenders were fine. Olivia showed up to the wedding the day of and told our planner she wanted to give my husband and I our meals separately (never did) and also got into an argument with my planner and her assistant over the service. This resulted in her shutting the door in my wedding assistant’s face. I do not understand how someone providing a service could be so blatantly disrespectful. Following the day, Olivia ended up apologizing via email and giving us money back for the food which was greatly appreciated. That said, it really doesn’t make up for the fact that our wedding was significantly negatively impacted because of the food and service, including so much unnecessary stress for us, my family, and our planner. Based on our experience, I would never recommend this company for your event.
