If you want your hair to be longer and more voluminous, with the potential for more styling versatility, you may want to consider getting a sew-in before your wedding day. First, though, you may be wondering: how long does a sew-in last? This protective style can be one of your best options for transforming your hair so it works with any number of [Black wedding hairstyles](https://www.theknot.com/content/black-wedding-hairstyles), but the lifespan is a detail that brides (and even bridesmaids and wedding guests) should be mindful of. After all, you don't want to put the time and effort into a style that won't make it to the big day, and if you want it for pre- and post-wedding events, you'll want to come up with a good sew-in maintenance timeline. Read on to find out more. 

**In this article:** How Long Does a Sew-In Last? | Factors | Maintenance | Timing for a Wedding




## How Long Does a Sew-In Last?

In general, a good quality sew-in will last about **six to eight weeks**. "That's why I love sew-ins for brides: they stay beautifully through all the events, from the showers to the big day and even into the honeymoon," says Jazmine Robinson, certified wig and extension hairstylist and Head of Product at [UNice](https://www.unice.com/). 

FEATURED VIDEO FROM THE KNOT

It's important to also note that a sew-in is different from wigs or tape-in extensions. A sew-in is ideal for [Black braided hairstyles](https://www.theknot.com/content/black-braided-hairstyles). It refers to a style where your natural hair is braided down, and then a stylist sews extensions onto those braids with a needle and thread. "It's one of the most popular protective styles because there's no glue or chemicals involved," Robinson explains. "People often use 'weave' as a catch-all term, but a sew-in is a specific method." 

Unlike a wig, which comes off on a daily basis, a sew-in is secured for weeks at a time and looks like it could be your natural hair (that's the ultimate goal, at least). You can choose between different textures and colors to match your hair. 

## Sew-In Weave Longevity Factors

When it comes to how long a sew-in can last, it's usually a few weeks – but there are factors that can ultimately affect their lifespan. Keep the below in mind when choosing a stylist and the type of hair you want to use. 

### Sew-In Quality 

A sew-in can be done with artificial hair or real human hair, and the quality of that hair will ultimately help determine how long it's going to last—and how long it's going to look natural and beautiful in your hair. "The hair itself is a big factor," Robinson says. "100% human hair will always last longer and look better than synthetic." Be sure to look for virgin hair, which is more durable and versatile than synthetic hair. 

### Stylist Expertise

Proper installation is key: not only for an overall look that is natural and gorgeous, but also for extensions that last as long as possible. "Neat braids and strong weaving thread make a big difference compared to cotton thread or a rushed job," Robinson notes. This is why it's important to pick a stylist who knows what they're doing. Get recommendations, read reviews, and try to see photos of their other work before you pick someone to do your sew-in. (Pro tip: [The Knot Vendor Marketplace](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/beauty-services) is a great place to start your search for a talented stylist.) 

### Sew-In Type

There are a few different types of sew-in methods and the one you choose can have an effect on [how long extensions last](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-long-do-hair-extensions-last). For example, a full sew-in (which covers your entire head with extensions) and a closure sew-in (which uses a lace or silk closure piece on your head) may last longer than a traditional sew-in. 

### Maintenance and Upkeep 

Taking proper care of your hair and the extensions is essential if you want your sew-in to last a while. "When you combine good hair, good technique and good care, the style lasts," Robinson says. You have to be sure to treat your extensions with care, but also to pay special attention to your [natural hair](https://www.theknot.com/content/natural-wedding-hairstyles) as well. 

## Sew-In Maintenance Tips 

Healthy natural hair and healthy extensions are a must if you want your sew-in to go the distance. Read on to learn exactly how to get the most out of your sew-in extensions. 

### Give your scalp some love 

You'll want to keep your scalp and natural hair healthy to ensure that your hair looks its best and that it's in good condition when the sew-in comes out. Robinson recommends cleansing the scalp every week or two using diluted shampoo. "Press the shampoo into the scalp instead of scrubbing hard so you don't loosen the base," she advises. 

### Avoid certain products 

Heavy products can weigh your hair down and affect the extensions. Robinson recommends lightweight, alcohol-free products that keep hair soft without adding any build-up. You can also [ask your hairstylist](https://www.theknot.com/content/questions-to-ask-your-hairstylist) for their product recommendations. 

### Keep strands hydrated 

Be sure to do some sort of moisturization pre-treatment before getting your sew-in, as this helps keep hair healthy and strong. A leave-in treatment or conditioner can keep your hair and scalp hydrated and can be used while extensions are in as well. 

### Care for the extensions too

Don't just focus on your natural hair—you'll also need to give your extensions some love. Protect your style while you're sleeping to keep it looking great. "At night, wrap it with a silk scarf or bonnet, or sleep on a pillowcase to cut down on frizz," Robinson says. She also recommends gently detangling extensions with a wide-tooth comb, starting at the ends. 

### Be careful about heat styling 

You can usually heat style your extensions (just double check that if you're using synthetic hair), but you need to be careful about doing too much. Robinson says to use a low heat if you're curling or straightening to keep them in good shape. 

### Don't try to push it for too long 

Ask your stylist how long your sew-in should last, and stick to that timeline. "Don't keep a sew-in in longer than eight weeks," Robinson says. "Taking it out on time protects both your hair and the extensions." Plus, trying to extend their lifespan past their prime can result in hair that doesn't look fantastic. 

### Book a maintenance appointment

If you feel uncomfortable washing your scalp on your own, you can usually book a maintenance appointment with the stylist who did your sew-in (or someone else). They can help keep your scalp and natural hair healthy while caring for your extensions. Just note this is going to be an extra cost. 

## How to Time Weave Installation for a Wedding

If you definitely want a sew-in before your wedding, you need to think about a few things. Do you want the extensions for all prewedding events, or just the big day? Do you want the sew-in to last through a honeymoon as well? Does your budget allow you to spend more on high-quality hair? These answers will affect when you should get your sew-in done before your wedding. 

If you're only interested in having a sew-in before the wedding day, Robinson recommends having a **sew-in installed three to five days before the celebration** , as this gives the style time to settle. "If it's your first sew-in or you've got a sensitive scalp, five days gives you more time to adjust," she explains. "If you're planning for the honeymoon, doing it about a week before works best so it's still fresh while you're away." 

If you want your sew-in done before your bridal shower or bachelorette party, consider the timeline. If your bridal shower is a month before the wedding, get it done a few days before so that it should last up until the wedding. If your bridal shower and/or bachelorette party are several months before the wedding, know that a sew-in done before those isn't going to last through until the wedding—you'll need to get another sew-in done in that case. 

And if you're looking for a Black wedding hairstylist you can trust to know the specifics of your ideal hairstyle and wedding or prewedding event timing, head to [The Knot Vendor Marketplace](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/beauty-services).
