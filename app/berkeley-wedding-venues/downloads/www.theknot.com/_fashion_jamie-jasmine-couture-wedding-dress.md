Description

The Jamie gown balances sophistication and bold style in luxurious Twill Mikado. Its structured yet fluid silhouette features a strapless bodice with a unique crisscross design and a flattering V waistline. The smooth A-line skirt flows into a semi-cathedral train, creating a dramatic, graceful finish. With regal design and understated luxury, Jamie is perfect for brides who want to make a statement without losing classic elegance.
