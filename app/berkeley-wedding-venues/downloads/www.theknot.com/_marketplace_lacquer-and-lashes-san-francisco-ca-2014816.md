I can’t recommend Nicole strongly enough if you want to have the most phenomenal makeup and lashes for the moments that matter most. I chose Nicole for my wedding make up and I am ...

so glad that I did. I’m the kind of girl who only wears make-up for special occasions, so I was very nervous about finding the right make-up artist who could make me look and feel beautiful but not “overly done.” At my bridal trial, I felt instantly comfortable with Nicole. She listened closely, understood exactly what I wanted, and executed it flawlessly—polished, timeless, and completely me. I was also curious about getting my lashes done because I was worried about a lash strip coming loose on the most important day of my life. Nicole talked me through the pros and cons of wearing a strip lash vs a lash set, and in the months leading up to my wedding, we decided to try out lash sets. This was super fun because not only did I discover I love the look of a fresh lash set, but I also got to spend more time with Nicole before my wedding, so when I actually saw her on the day of my wedding, I felt completely at ease. My mom and bridesmaids also loved her and her work. Nicole did a masterful job accentuating the beauty of multiple skin types, skin tones, and facial features. Our make-up photographed beautifully, lasted all day and night, and never felt heavy or cakey. She was calm, organized, and a genuinely grounding presence on a hectic wedding morning. I felt confident, comfortable, and like the best version of myself. I would recommend her without hesitation to any bride who wants herself and her entourage to look stunning and still feel like themselves. Absolutely incredible experience from start to finish.

olutely saved the day. Even though she wasn’t feeling well, she still showed up and did an incredible job. That kind of dedication and reliability meant the world to me. Almost a year later, she made my actual wedding day feel completely stress free. And let’s be honest, weddings and stress free don’t usually go together. She brought such a calm, comforting energy, and I really loved talking with her and getting to know her while she did my makeup. She also did makeup for my mom, my sister, and my mother-in-law. We all have very different skin tones (and personalities, haha) but Nicole took care of each of us flawlessly. Everyone felt confident and beautiful, and that was all thanks to her. For my own look, I asked for something a little different than our trial bridal makeup, and she completely delivered (also she remembered what she used for our trial, again a year ago, which is crazy when you see all the products she has). Nicole is not just a professional, she’s a true artist. I have nothing but kind words to say about her, and I’m so grateful she was part of such a special day.

e us feel and look like elevated versions of ourselves without pushing us too far out of our comfort zones. Nicole was exactly that person for us and so much more. From the moment she met us at the door to her studio we knew we were in good hands. Nicole is not only incredibly knowledgeable about all things beauty, but she is truly one of the most warm, approachable people we have had the fortune to meet, let alone work with. She took time to learn about us as individuals and as a couple, and asked very thoughtful questions about what we were comfortable with in terms of makeup and lashes. She fully respected our preferences and made recommendations informed by what we had shared with her. Starting our wedding day with having our makeup done by Nicole put us at ease, like we were just chatting with a friend while getting ready. We both looked gorgeous and felt gorgeous thanks to Nicole's artistry. Nicole was always prompt, friendly, and professional in her communications and that translated to every meeting with her in person, too. She is precisely the person you want on your team for an event as important as your wedding, and we feel so lucky to have had her on ours. Thank you, Nicole!

I also tried out eyelash extensions with Nicole in her beautiful studio a couple times ahead of the wedding, and I LOVE them. On my wedding day they traveled down to Half Moon Bay and ensured that everything kept on time/ahead of time so nothing got stressful. Nicole and Ashley were so fun to get ready with, and my bridesmaids and myself were so happy with the results. We felt beautiful! Highly recommend!!!

I had the opportunity to do a few lash sessions prior to my wedding, and Nicole helped me get used to and discover my favorite lash extension shape and type! She’s very communicative, comforting, and clear, and also does a great job at listening and really hearing what your vision is. I can’t wait to come back for future lash appointments!!

Not only is she really talented, she is an absolute JOY to work with and we had the best time! She took all of my feedback and literally executed it *perfectly* on wedding day! Also, she is cool as a cucumber no matter what—our makeup room was crazy and busy with 11 girls to do and she was just calm and steady the whole time. Everyone looked phenomenal. And I’m particularly grateful for how she made my mother-in-law feel— she was super nervous as she doesn’t ever wear makeup, but has been undergoing chemo so she didn’t have any eyebrows or lashes and wanted to feel like herself for our big day. Nicole made her feel like a queen, and it showed. THANK YOU SO MUCH!

I do not wear much makeup normally, and Nicole was able to distill my random adjectives about my ideas for my makeup (natural, glowy, not too much, slightly glammy), into a PERFECT wedding look. She really understood what I was looking for, took her time getting everything perfect, and my makeup was flawless all day long! She came early to do makeup for me and three others and spent time getting to know us each and what we wanted, was flexible and accommodating, and a complete pro. AND if you are considering lashes, she is the best–I feel really lucky to have found and worked with Nicole in all capacities.

Nicole has the greatest personality, and really knows what she is doing! 10/10 would recommend her!

re of than the day of my wedding. Having done our makeup trial a year and a half prior to my wedding due to covid, I was a little nervous that it might look totally different than our trial run, but if it's possible, I looked even better. Nicole is both makeup artist extraordinaire and exact scientist, getting the perfect tones by blending various products. She is so kind and friendly, and even my moms (whose daily routine is a little bit of foundation and mascara and have never had someone else do their makeup in their lives) absolutely loved her. She took her time and explained to all of us what she was doing and made some product recommendations for my parents. I'm pretty sure my mom even tried to hire her as an esthetician at her clinic on the spot. I'm not one to pamper myself regularly, but the knowledge and care that Nicole brings has me thinking about getting lash extensions from her! I cannot recommend Nicole enough. Get her on your wedding glam squad now!

She listened to my requests for slight changes from my trial and gave me a look that was exactly what I wanted and more.

I'll for sure hire Nicole for my next makeup/lashes/beautification related needs. She even recommended my amazing hairstylist (another Nicole) so I have her to thank for my whole wedding look!

Nicole is wonderful, talented, and a true professional! I was fortunate to find her and have her do my makeup for both my wedding day and a second wedding banquet celebration a few...

days later. I also had two separate trial sessions with her beforehand, plus a lash appointment the day before my wedding. On all 5 days we met Nicole was punctual, efficient, and so easy to work with. I appreciated that on the days where time was limited she even kept a timer to make sure we stayed on schedule. She's also easy to talk to and just a very nice person in general. As a professional she listens to what you want and is very open to feedback to adjust anything that doesn't make you feel like "you." Her work made me feel so beautiful on my wedding day, and the makeup really stay put from 7am through the late hours of the night. By the time I went to wash my face after both celebration days, everything was still in place. Her lash work is also fabulous, and she will take care of your lashes, without putting on more than is good for whatever your natural lashes can handle. I would recommend Nicole in a heartbeat to any future brides, or anyone who needs makeup or lashes for special events. You will be in the best of hands!

Nicole was truly the best ever! I am not someone who wears a lot of makeup and both myself and my now husband (!! :D) prefer a natural look. I was debating about having my make up ...

done professionally, but once I met Nicole and had a trial session, I knew it was going to be worth every penny and I was right! My overall experience with Nicole exceeded all of my expectations. She was professional, thoughtful and efficient. I've heard horror stories about hair and makeup taking longer than planned, but Nicole and Ashley (her friend who does hair - I also HIGHLY recommend Ashley) were so well-timed and on top of things I never had to worry on the day of my wedding. Nicole was the only make up person I had, and she handled my mom, myself and a handful of my bridesmaids. She was so good - both in execution and time management - that she even accommodated one of my bridesmaids who made the last minute decision to get her make up done after meeting Nicole and seeing how amazing her work was! I was skeptical about wearing the fake eyelashes because my makeup routine is so simple, and Nicole really listened to my concerns and in between my trial and the day of my wedding, looked for a set of eyelashes that would fit my simple/natural looking requirements. The end result was FLAWLESS. I got so many compliments and people were amazed when I told them that they weren't my real lashes. Bottom line, trust Nicole - she's got you and definitely knows what she's doing. Finally, it was really important to me that my wedding vendors felt like family and I cannot speak enough to how amazing Nicole and Ashley are as people. I was legitimately sad to see them go! If you want someone who you can trust, who can handle anything, be on time and efficient, is calm, reassuring and a blast to be with on your wedding: hire Nicole (and Ashley!). It will be one of the best decisions you'll make (other than marrying your soon-to-be spouse ;) )

contact, she responded quickly, with detail, and with a positive and warm attitude. She spent quality time on my trial and made sure I looked glamorous, but also like myself, which was important to me as someone who doesn’t wear a ton of makeup on a day-to-day basis. My skin was flaring, and she made sure to cover everything so I felt beautiful and confident. She arrived right on time at 5:40am (!) on my wedding day and finished everyone’s makeup promptly so we had time for photos before our early ceremony at 2pm. Nicole really listened to the wants and needs of each of my bridesmaids who all loved their makeup! Very talented makeup artist and all around lovely, kind person. If she’s available, book her!

Nicole Meadows is pure magic! I had Nicole as my makeup artists for my wedding on July 14, 2018. She not only did my makeup, but all 8 bridesmaids and my mom! First, I did a trial...

with her in December prior to my wedding in July to see her work. I provided her my Pinterest board filled with makeup ideas for my wedding. She went through it with me to help me decide what would be best together for my bridal look. I appreciate her going through the eyeshadow colors, blush and highlight, foundation for my skin type, and a bunch of different lipsticks and lip stains. Not only was my makeup trial amazing but it was so fun! It felt like a day hanging with the girls! After the trial, I was talking with Nicole about how I wanted to buy a lip stain like the ones we tried on me for the trial. She mentioned to me she was in area and met up with me at Sephora to help me pick out some colors. Wow! How amazing is she! She went out of her way to personally help me! It did not stop there- I would ask her questions about skin care and she would send me recommendations/ideas. I had one more trial in June to go over some bridal look changes and have my mom do a makeup trial too. Nicole started doing airbrush foundation and I wanted to give it a try. She did a wonderful job matching my skin color and it looked amazing! My skin looked so smooth and it felt so light! I planned to use this for my wedding. My mom’s trial also went very well too! She enhanced my mom’s beauty with a perfect Mother of the Bride look. My mom loved it because she wanted to feel polished but not overdone. Wedding Day!!! Nicole had to arrive very early- 5:00 in the morning to make sure everyone was done on time. She was so calm throughout the entire day even with her workload of 10 women! When I was getting my makeup done, she made me feel so relaxed- like a spa day! I also threw in a wrench and wanted my original makeup trial look that was waterproof because I was already caught up in the wedding bliss and was feeling very emotional on the day of. She didn’t even miss a beat and was absolutely understanding about my change of heart! I’m glad I did as I cried throughout my wedding ceremony- and my makeup looked flawless even with all the happy tears! I am so thankful that I had Nicole there on my wedding day! I felt so beautiful and so did all my bridesmaids and my momma. Like I said, she is magic, in her talent, time management, and sweet calm demeanor! I love you, Nicole!!!!
