This is almost 1yr after our wedding (I know, so late for our vendor reviews 😬) but we loved our experience with Wine Country Entertainment and their violin/piano duo! They played...

We used Wine Country Entertainment for all of our wedding entertainment, including an accoustic guitarist (Tom Duarte), string quartet (Synchronicity Strings), dance band (Entourag...

e), and karaoke DJ...and all of the artists and performances were amazing and completely exceeded our expectations. I cannot speak highly enough of the artists that work for WCE and the experience they provide.

We used the Dave Blakely Duo for our recent wedding in Napa Valley. We had them learn a few new songs, and asked them to played as the whole wedding congregation sang a hymn. I was...

a little nervous about those things, but they did a good job. They also were perfect for the cocktail hour, and were nice to my little nephew who was very interested in their instruments. They were a little late coming in at one point in the wedding, and email communication was only okay. Still, they were very nice and probably would be even better if it was not a destination wedding, and we had been able to meet before hand. I would recommend them to other brides!

FUN! Wine Country Entertainment may have been my favorite vendor to work with! They were so easy, responsive, and they really made sure that our wedding was fun! They really went a...

bove and beyond to make sure that our wedding was special. Definitely spring for the photo booth – not only was it super fun for our guests – but we received a link for all of the photos after our wedding – and that brought on a whole new round of fun and laughter at getting to see ALL of the pictures that our guests took. Thank you for everything you did to make our wedding great – and thank you for being so easy and professional to work with!
