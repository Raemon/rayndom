of their way to rave about the tri tip and the chicken, and the Greek salad was one of the best I’ve had. Portions were generous, flavors were excellent, and everything was served hot and on time. Aliki and her team were professional, organized, and very easy to work with throughout the planning process. Communication was clear, timelines were handled smoothly, and execution on the day of the wedding was seamless. They were calm, efficient, and clearly experienced with large events. We chose Kitchenina for our wedding and would absolutely book them again for future events. If you want high-quality food, reliable service, and a team you can trust on an important day, Kitchenina is a great choice

d thoughtful, and went above and beyond in every aspect of our planning. Our reception dinner was amazing and exactly what we had imagined for our wedding. We can’t count how many of our guests came up to us during the wedding to share how much they enjoyed the food. And not to mention how thoughtful it was that Kostas personally served us our meal to ensure we had time to enjoy our food during a very busy wedding. In addition to the delicious food we were most impressed when we saw how they operated during the day of the wedding, managing the entire serving staff, and executing a pretty big flip between the ceremony and reception without a hitch. Overall we could not speak higher of the Kitchenina staff and would hire them again if given the chance.

with our wedding but catering was not one of them. Kitchenina worked with us on the price, helped us navigate the reception space, and fed 200 people in a buffet style set up in under 30 minutes. They were kind, supportive and professional throughout the process. We received so many complements on the food as well as the friendliness of the staff. The food was so yummy that we are still eating it 5 days later and have not tired of it yet. I highly recommend the salmon. I am so happy I went with them and would hire them for any large event I have in the future.

of our guests took time to compliment us on how delicious the food was and how friendly all the staff were. I wish I could take credit, but that was all Aliki, Kostas, and their team's doing. The entire process was straightforward and transparent. The tasting was easy to schedule and they made adjustments to fit some dietary restrictions we knew some guests would have. Overall the cost was very reasonable compared to the quotes we got from 3-4 other vendors. If you are someone who is looking for a great caterer that is very communicative, attentive, and willing to go above and beyond to make your day that much more special while all still fitting in a reasonable budget, then Kitchenina is the right choice for you.

were opting for a slightly different dinner experience, and they were with us all the way. We went to a tasting months before which confirmed how delicious the food was, and Aliki was great at communicating the various steps and requirements of the event. At the vendors' walkthrough, her experience of the venue really helped us visualise the set-up. The day itself went flawlessly (except for the weather!) and we had many compliments on the food that was offered. Aliki and her staff were super friendly and helpful before and during the evening, which helped us feel at ease.

ibly delicious food was a struggle, but Kitchenina absolutely exceeded all expectations. From the very beginning, Kitchenina was a dream to work with. Their website was informative and easy to navigate, and working with them to design our completely vegan menu was a yummy and enjoyable process. They were so flexible and communicative throughout the entire planning, making us feel completely at ease, taking care of food, catering, rentals, and bartending. On the day of our wedding, the food was a standout! Our guests, many of whom are not vegan, raved about how yummy everything was. Seriously, we had so many compliments on the flavors and quality of the food. It was a testament to Kitchenina's skill and creativity that they could create such satisfying and delicious vegan dishes that everyone loved. Beyond the incredible food, the service provided by Kitchenina's team was top-notch and very professional. Everything ran smoothly, and the staff were attentive and friendly. If you are looking for a caterer who is not only talented and produces amazing food (vegan or otherwise!) but is also incredibly easy to work with, flexible, and communicative, look no further than Kitchenina. They helped make our wedding day truly special, and we are so grateful!

nsive and professional (she managed to answer most if not all questions I had before I even got to ask). During our tasting, we met with Chef Konstantine, who not only prepared our initial selections to perfection but also gave honest feedback for crafting our menu design, which really shows how passionate and genuinely they care about not only executing the cooking aspect flawlessly, but also elevating the holistic experience of the guests. On our wedding day, Aliki and the Kitchenina team were punctual, helpful and efficient in setting up. From the cocktail hour hors d'oeuvres to buffet dinner, they were so attentive about serving our guests in a timely manner. We had a good amount of vegetarians/pescatarians amongst our 180+ headcount and Aliki and her team were mindful of that as well. Everyone including my husband and I loved the food! If i had to pick my top 3, it would be 1) apple brie arugula flatbread, 2) guava honey chipotle chicken, 3) salmon with lemon & tomatoes, 4) lamb roast, and 5) cauliflower souffle (yes, I couldn't just pick 3). Thank you so much to Kitchenina for making our day extra special not only with your delicious food but also for the most amazing catering experience :)

The entire Kitchenina team came ready to work and provided exceptional service. They were dedicated to ensuring that our experience was seamless, and we never felt like just another paycheck. Their attention to our guests was outstanding, treating everyone with the utmost respect while maintaining their signature style. In our community, dessert and tea play a significant role in the celebration. Kitchenina went above and beyond to ensure hot water was available and collaborated with our parents to ensure everything went smoothly. This level of attentiveness showed that they truly listen to their clients and value every detail. The food was simply delicious! The groom can't stop raving about the tri-tip—it was just as perfect as it was during the tasting. Working with Kitchenina was a breeze. They genuinely care about you from the initial booking through the event itself. I felt no need to follow up; I trusted the team completely, and they delivered beyond our expectations. Choosing Kitchenina is a decision you will not regret!

e an effort to fit us into her schedule for a tasting outside normal hours when we were in the area, which we really appreciated. Kostas is an excellent chef across a variety of cuisines and styles, and every dish we had at our wedding was excellent, and in many cases even better than the samples we tried at our tasting! The Kitchenina staff also did a great job setting up our reception, and the result was visually even better than we had imagined. The event staff was also great, and made sure we were well fed and taken care of throughout the evening. One small thing for other couples to know is that Kitchenina charges fees for things like tastings and vendor walkthroughs (even when required by the venue), when some of the other caterers we spoke to do not. These fees are quite reasonable and Kitchenina's overall service fees and costs are considerably lower than most other caterers at their level of quality, so it was not a problem for us at all, but hopefully good information for others so there are no surprises later on. We're very glad we hired Kitchenina for our wedding and would happily recommend them to other couples!

(We had lots of tasty savory items.) She communicated well with the event space manager and made sure things went well behind the scenes on the night of event. After the event I noticed that a special cake serving spatula that I brought with me had been accidentally packed away with their catering items. They promptly sent it back to me once I notified them. Aliki and her team met and exceed expectations and I recommend them.

ncredibly communicative and promptly scheduled a tasting, even though our wedding was over a year away. The tasting was exceptional—the food was so delicious that we wanted to include everything on our dinner menu! With Chef Kostas's expert guidance, we finalized our selections. As the wedding approached, I realized that our menu featured a mix of different cuisines, and I wanted to streamline it to focus on one. We had also initially chosen a buffet-style dinner, but after a venue walkthrough, it became clear that there wasn't enough space. Just a month before the wedding, we decided to change both the dinner service style and the menu. Kostas and Aliki were incredibly accommodating, understanding, and helpful during this transition, with Kostas offering excellent suggestions for the revised menu. On the day of the wedding, Kostas and Aliki went above and beyond, personally serving us at the sweetheart table. The food was divine—I still dream about the risotto! My brother and several guests made a point to tell us how much they loved the food throughout the evening. When we ran out of alcohol shortly after the cocktail hour, they even sent someone to buy more, seamlessly handling the situation without missing a beat. Everything was flawless, and the food was simply unforgettable. I cannot recommend Aliki and Kostas highly enough. Thank you both for making our day so special!

the wedding working with Aliki was extremely easy, professional, and carefree which was a relief and gave us quite a bit of peace of mind throughout the entire process. We also met Aliki's husband during a delicious tasting session before the wedding which was in Redwood City. We both rented various dishes, silverware, and decor from Kitchenina as well as doing appateizers and mains for food. Logistically all the dishes/silverware and looked as we expected and were all correctly set up for all our guests. The food was delicious! There were so many options/variety that we were able to choose from and everything turned out delicious. There was plenty of food for the guests and seconds for those that wanted it. I can't say enough great things about Kitchenina and would highly recommend them for any catering need you have!

The hummus meatballs were so good they were all gone by the time the after party wrapped at 3am.

delicious the food was. It was also easy to put together a selection (we served dinner buffet style) that had plenty of vegetarian/vegan and gluten-free options. We saw several guests go back for seconds, including one of our vegan guests. Even before the event, Kostas and Aliki were incredibly helpful. They helped us settle on our menu and gave us other pointers and tips to make our day go smoothly. In addition to the meal, they also set up our dessert table (we rented dessert stands from them). We would highly recommend them for any and all events.

nd after we chose the food, they hooked us up with chair, table and bar rental as well as a bartender for the party. Aliki and her husband (and the staff) were very easy to work with and responsive to our questions and request and very easy to work with. Literally couldn’t be happier with how the food and service turned out! I looked around when I was done with my plate and every single person had cleaned their plate and was offered second portions (although most people were already full from apps and the dinner!) we had some many people taking for days about how great this or that food was, and a couple people even came up to me and said “It’s very rare you have food this good at a wedding” Vern pleased. You will not go wrong hiring Kitchenina

ost importantly, the food was amazing!!! We started working with Aliki and Kostas almost a year before our wedding. We didn’t love any of the vendors on our venue's preferred list so we went looking for better and found Kitchenina. Our first experience with them was a tasting that was basically a 5 course meal. We got to try multiple appetizers, side dishes, entrees, and a salad. Needless to say, it was delicious. I keep asking Kostas if he will bottle the sauce he used for the salmon so I can buy it. On the day of our wedding their team was amazing. They transformed an empty museum exhibit hall into our reception dinner in less than 2 hours, setting up 19 tables, 2 buffets, 2 bars, and a sweetheart table. All 190 guests had been served and finished eating in less than an hour. We never had to worry about a single thing on the day, if anything came up, we never noticed and they didn’t tell us haha. The food was so good we were excited to eat the leftovers for the next week! We also were purchasing our own alcohol for the reception and Aliki let us ask her bar manager tons of questions so we could make sure we had enough variety and quantity in our alcohol and mixers. We cannot recommend Kitchenina enough, they were amazing to work with, incredibly kind, and remarkably talented.

We even have some family members, ourselves included, trying to mimic their recipes– however, our attempts don’t even come close :) Our guests loved the food, the service was amazing, and everyone was so kind and generous. Their kindness, responsiveness, and professionalism are all things we really appreciated throughout this process. We have many newly engaged friends and family and we have already been recommending Kitchenina– just another excuse to hopefully eat their food again! They even let us take home leftovers so we got to enjoy their food a little longer. 10/10 would recommend using for your big day.

menu changes, We got meatballs and endive leaf bowls (my favorite) for our appetizers, and our main course was salmon, beef tips, green beans, rice, and asian salad. At first I thought my husband and I had missed out on appetizers while we were taking pictures, but Aliki thought ahead and grabbed a plate for us! They did the same with dinner so we got huge servings of everything. Unfortunately, because of my nerves and stomach butterflies, I couldn’t eat much, but Kitchenina packed up all the leftovers for us, so I got to truly enjoy everything again! They also cut our cake, and did a great job making sure all our guests got a piece, even though our cake was probably a little too small. The staff was friendly and really went above and beyond cleaning our venue’s dishes and helping us move tables at the end of the night! Definitely will use them for any future catering events.

e allergies and food intolerances. Our venue also did not have an onsite kitchen and only provided tables and chairs. Aliki and team helped us navigate these obstacles seamlessly before and during the wedding. They have so many food options on their website and for our final menu at the wedding, each of our guests had several dishes they could choose from that could accommodate their specific needs (including our friends who were vegan and gluten intolerant and had nut allergies). Aliki had great attention to detail, and translated our vision and our guest needs into a beautiful and tasty dinner and table setting. She was great at anticipating potential hiccups at the wedding (such as advising us to choose darker table cloths for our coffee bar to decrease the look of any potential coffee stains) while also staying within our budget. We got multiple compliments from our guests about the food and the service. They helped us keep the whole day stress free and joyous. We will definitely recommend them to any of our friends who are getting married.

onstantin, husband-and-wife owners of Kitchenina, were wonderful to work with. Aliki was extremely responsive, professional, and honest. She helped guide us through our menu design, offering suggestions on items she thought would be more of a hit while avoiding falling into the trap of upselling unnecessary items. Not only was the food unbelievably delicious, but extremely reasonable as well (they could definitely increase their price per head if they wanted to!) We went for a Greek theme, serving falafel, dolmas, and spanakopita during cocktail hour, and Greek salad, pita & hummus, chicken, lamb, roasted potatoes, roasted vegetables, and Mediterranean risotto for dinner. We chose to go with family style even though Aliki was transparent about the fact that this would cost more, and I'm very glad we did - the presentation was warm and inviting, allowing us to feel like we were hosting an intimate dinner party for friends, and the service was impeccable. And of course, I would be remiss if I failed to mention again how AMAZING the food was! All of our guests loved the catering - we received so many compliments on the food and everyone shared that our wedding was one of the best they'd ever been to. Aliki and Konstantin hosted us for two separate tastings - once to sample their cooking when we were deciding on a caterer, and once to sample additional items when we were finalizing our menu. Both times they were warm and accommodating. We sourced our own drinks but used their bartending team to serve them at the wedding, and they were very flexible with us even though we made several changes to our beverage menu at the last minute. Just another example of their willingness to accommodate our needs even down to the wire. I could go on an on about how amazing it was to work with Kitchenina. I would 200% work with them again! I honestly can't recommend them enough. Thank you, Aliki and Konstantin, for helping us throw an event we will truly never forget.

If we had to summarize our experience with having Kitchenina cater our wedding, it would be amazing food, amazing service! We got married at OVY Camp in San Gregorio, CA in May 202...

3 with a headcount of 165 guests, including 10 children. Kitchenina had catered dozens of weddings there and was highly recommended by the venue, so after we looked at their menu online and found dishes we liked, we contacted them to learn more and check if they were available on our wedding date. Kostas provided a very professional tasting experience at Kitchenina’s kitchen in Redwood City. We loved the dishes we tasted, including the chile verde mac and cheese, teriyaki chicken, and coconut curry tofu. We left the tasting with all of our questions about the menu, rentals, and logistics answered. We requested menus and quotes from a few of our venue’s other recommended caterers, but Kitchenina’s fresh menu appealed to us most and was the most affordable per head. Aliki and Kostas explained that they buy ingredients in bulk because they cater a high volume of meals for large tech companies in the Bay Area and pass on the savings from buying in bulk to their customers. In the month before the wedding, Aliki scheduled a meeting with us and our day-of coordinator to go over all the details, including headcount, logistics, and rentals. Aliki helped us add rentals and had us specify the color of the napkins and tablecloths. She also went over all of our questions about dietary restrictions of guests. Many dishes are gluten free, dairy free, or onion and garlic free without compromising on flavor! Day of, the set up and service went very smoothly, thanks to the professionalism of the bartenders, servers, and chef. The servers kept the buffet line flowing, while the bartenders moved guests quickly through the line for drinks. All of the staff were friendly and welcoming, creating a positive atmosphere for our guests. The team put together a beautiful dessert table that guests loved. Partway through dancing, the servers put out our late night snack of spanakopita and flatbread. At the end of the night the staff worked with our coordinator to pack up all of our decor and the leftover food. They left the space incredibly clean and tidy, which was especially helpful because we had guests staying on site and using the space for activities the next day. We would absolutely recommend Kitchenina to any couple planning a wedding in the Bay Area. Throughout the whole process, Aliki and Kostas were professional, warm and friendly, quick to respond, accommodating of our needs, and knowledgeable about everything we would need to make our event a success. They are pros in this business and it shows in everything they do. Their past experience catering at our DIY venue made the process even more smooth because they could tell us exactly what to expect. Thank you for making our special day so special, Aliki, Kostas, and team!
