Updated May 15, 2025

Benson Boone's "Beautiful Things" was the most-streamed song in the world in 2024, but don't call the artist a one-hit wonder—especially when it comes to romantic tracks. Skimming through his catalog, we found tons of Benson Boone wedding songs suitable for everything from touching first dances, to heartfelt processionals, to some chill cocktail hour mingling. Not to mention, the teaser of his unreleased "The Momma Song" has our team getting teary eyed over the thought of the tune being used as one of the sweetest [mother-son dance songs](https://www.theknot.com/content/mother-son-wedding-songs) ever. 

[READ MORE Need a Live Band? We've Got 'Em Right Here ](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/live-wedding-bands)

Whether your wedding feels more in line with the singer's soft-and-slow ballads or his electric-and-spirited stage presence, these Benson Boone love songs will totally tug at your heartstrings. PS: Don't forget to book a wedding DJ on [The Knot Vendor Marketplace](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/wedding-djs) to help you create a playlist you'll want to stream over 2 billion times (à la "Beautiful Things").

**Bonus:** Listen to our picks with The Knot's list of [Benson Boone Love Songs](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/76FkRvlNYeFJ8vRTierP3I?si=e7ac969777794457) playlist on Spotify.

## 1\. "Room for 2," _Walk Me Home…_

**Lyrics you'll love:** "When you're barely holding on/I'll be anything you want/Open up my heart for you/Baby, I got room for two"

This sweet-and-upbeat track would make a great addition to your reception playlist, if you're on the hunt for a dance floor song that offers a little breather from jumping and bumping around. The beat's moderate tempo holds throughout the verses, while the chorus begins with a more stripped-down score and then crescendoes. An orchestral or acoustic version of this song would be a nice choice for music during cocktail hour or as guests filter into the ceremony space. (Though if you do have a live wedding band, you'll get the benefit of hearing the lyrics, which suggest that you and your partner will always have room in your hearts for each other, no matter how tough life gets.)

## 2\. "Work of Art," _Walk Me Home…_

**Lyrics you'll love:** "I sit here, painting perfect pictures/Of every moment with you/I've known it from the start/Darling, you're my work of art"

If you select this Benson Boone love song as your ceremony processional, there won't be a dry eye in the house. The track's soft score feels sentimental, but also builds in all the right places—like during the chorus from which we plucked the lyrics above. It's one of our favorite [songs to walk down the aisle to](https://www.theknot.com/content/songs-to-walk-down-aisle-to) on this list, since the lyrics draw attention to the radiance of the marrier as they step toward their true love. Plus, it has potential to be even more emotionally resonant (if that's even possible) if played by a string quartet. 

## 3\. "Beautiful Things," _Fireworks & Rollerblades_

**Lyrics you'll love:** "I found a girl my parents love/She'll come and stay the night, and I think I might have it all/And I thank God every day/For the girl He sent my way"

### Find your kind of venue

From barns to ballrooms, discover reception venues that feel like you.

Of course we couldn't make a playlist of Benson Boone songs for weddings without including his most-popular hit. Performed at the 2024 VMAs, 2025 Grammys and on Taylor Swift's Eras tour, "Beautiful Things" would be a slam dunk at your celebration. The track is suitable for a first dance, especially if you're looking for a tune that has slow and romantic moments along with passionate and energetic parts. Imagine a slow sway that bursts into a dip or lift—too good. And given the song's popularity, there's no doubt that a crop of your late-Millenial and Gen Z guests would sing along if Benson Boone's most-popular song played during your reception or after-party. 

## 4\. "Death Wish Love," _Twisters the Album_

**Lyrics you'll love:** "I'll scream your name until my lungs give out/Pull me down again/I love you, and I'll love you to death/Love you for as long as I get"

This one goes out to all of our spooky/macabre couples: Is there really anything more romantic than "'til death do us part" energy? You might recognize this Benson Boone song as the one in the 2024 film _Twisters_. "Death Wish Love" has some light country-folk vibes going on and moves at a moderate pace. It would be a great choice to play during cocktail hour and could even work as a joyful, yet relaxed recessional. Think of how cool it could sound at a chill outdoor wedding in the country with plenty of wildflowers around. 

## 5\. "Before You," _Before You_

**Lyrics you'll love:** "All of the nights I spent/Drowning my discontent/Wasting me away, everything has changed/Now that I've found us/And it feels like home/Darling, if you don't mind/I'll take your hand tonight/We could just slow down time/Let me adore you"

Is someone chopping onions in here? This darling ballad would make for a tear-jerker of a first dance. The lyrical storytelling is beautiful and the song captures the feeling of falling in love for the first time. It beckons the listener to slow down and enjoy every moment spent with their partner, even the small ones. (Whew, we need tissues.) 

## 6\. "Little Runaway," _Pulse_

**Lyrics you'll love:** "There's a universe in front of us/That knows how small we are/Won't you come, and we can stare at the stars?/From the roof of my car"

This tender ballad would make a beautiful choice for preceremony music. The lyrics are definitely romantic, though might skew a little less joyful and traditional for some. However, an instrumental version of the tune played on the piano would definitely still work for those softer, more contemplative moments of your wedding day. Bonus points if you and your soon-to-be spouse spent a date night or two stargazing in the early days of your relationship. 

## 7\. "Forever and a Day," _Fireworks & Rollerblades_

**Lyrics you'll love:** "I knew that smile from miles away/I knew that I have loved you/Forever and a day/A day"

If you felt an instant connection with your partner the first time you met (and it felt like you've known each other your whole lives), this is one of Benson Boone's best songs for your wedding. The singer's warbling voice on this track gives us butterflies every time we hear it, and the small crescendo after the chorus is the perfect opportunity for a dip or twirl during a first dance. The ultra-romantic lyrics deserve to be heard, so if you have a live band or singer crooning during your cocktail hour, reception or right before you all hit the aisle, definitely ask them to add this song to their repertoire.

## 8\. "Intro," _Fireworks & Rollerblades_

**Lyrics you'll love:** "Do you believe there is a life/Where it's just you and me and I?/We don't need to wait, we don't need a sign/It's only you and me and I"

For such a short song (just over a minute) this one really says it all. The lyrics give a nod to getting married and starting a life together, just the two of you, and how you're embarking on this journey right now. A pretty piano melody—a hallmark of many of these Benson Boone wedding songs—grounds this tune. We could see this [love song for him](https://www.theknot.com/content/love-songs-for-him), her or them playing as you walk into your reception as newly minted spouses, or even as a super-short first dance for couples who don't want the spotlight for more than 60 seconds. 

## 9\. "Be Someone," _Fireworks & Rollerblades_

**Lyrics you'll love:** "Someone to have, someone to hold/Somewhere to go when nights get cold/Somebody to love, somebody to be/Someone to sweep you off your feet"

On Boone's 2024 album "Intro" leads right into "Be Someone," and the lyrics of the former tune reappear in the latter. This is somewhat of a higher-energy track compared to the rest of the crooner's catalog, so it could make a nice cake-cutting song or chiller dance floor hit. The "to have and to hold" language in the lyrics totally sold us on this being a wedding song. 

## 10\. "Coffee Cake," _Pulse_

**Lyrics you'll love:** "You can talk with me for days/Over lousy coffee cake/We don't need to watch the time"

This upbeat, poppy tune could play in the background during your cocktail hour or at the very least have a spot on your Benson Boone song list for getting ready on the day. It strikes the perfect balance between bright and easygoing. Plus, the lyrics give us that giddy first-crush feeling. 

## 11\. "Mystical Magical," _Mystical Magical_

**Lyrics you'll love:** "My love is so mystical, magical/Oh, baby, 'cause once you know/Once you know/My little hard-to-get baby/I wanna give you the world"

If you or your partner were notorious for playing hard to get in your early dating days, this sassy, retro-esque banger will be your anthem. Whether it makes its way onto your pregame playlist, your reception DJ's set or you use the catchy chorus as a recessional or reception entrance song, we're so here for it. This is one of Benson Boone's newest songs, and the flirty lyrics make us blush. 

## 12\. "There She Goes,"_Fireworks & Rollerblades_

**Lyrics you'll love:** "Oh, there she goes/Out of the blue, she comes around/She turned my whole life upside down/Out of the blue, out of the clouds/And I can't stop her now"

It's not your typical wedding song, but this jam feels like a fit for the wedding playlist of a couple who spend some time dating long distance before tying the knot. Boone's lyrics are a lament for being away from the woman he loves without being too slow or saccharine. We love how this song would sound performed by a live band.
