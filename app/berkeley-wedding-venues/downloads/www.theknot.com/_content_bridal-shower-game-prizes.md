## Bridal Shower Game Prize Etiquette

You have the ideas for your bridal shower prizes—now it's time to finalize the details. These tips will answer the basic questions about how many prizes you need and how much to spend.

### How much should I spend on bridal shower game prizes?

The amount of money you spend on bridal shower prizes will ultimately depend on your overall budget, but anywhere between $5 and $20 per item is usually an appropriate range. You may opt for some "splurge" prizes to reward the big winner(s) of the games, especially if you're playing a game that requires a lot of effort on the guests' part. A top prize at a slightly higher price point (think: a set of wine glasses or gourmet cupcakes) will raise the stakes and entice guests to participate. If you're giving bridal shower prizes to all of the game participants, you might consider maximizing your spend with bulk prizes or smaller items at a lower price point.

### How many shower prizes should you have?

You'll need one grand prize for each of the bridal shower games you're playing during the party. (Think: [bridal jeopardy](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-jeopardy-questions), [bridal shower bingo](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-shower-bingo) or a [bridal shower word search](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-shower-word-search).) If there's room in your budget, you can include optional second- and third-place prizes for each game, or reward all the players with small prizes for participating. Remember: Bridal shower game prizes are different from [bridal shower favors](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-shower-favors). The favors, which are usually distributed at the end of the party, are a way to thank your guests for their time and should be given to everyone who attends.

### Are gift cards good bridal shower prizes?

Gift cards make great bridal shower game prizes. After all, who doesn't love treating themselves to a fully-funded shopping spree? Think about some common interests shared by your crew to help you decide which gift cards to get. For instance, if you and your friends love sharing book recommendations with one another, a [Barnes & Noble](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/b/gift-cards/_/N-8rg) gift card is sure to get them fired up during game time. If you're friends with a lot of foodies, consider choosing gift cards for [DoorDash](https://www.doordash.com/gift-cards). When in doubt, you can never go wrong with an [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BRSC4Z8C/?tag=tkcommerce-218-20) gift card.
