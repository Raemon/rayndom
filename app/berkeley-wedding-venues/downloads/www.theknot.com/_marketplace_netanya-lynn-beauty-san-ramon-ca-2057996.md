ne a trial prior to the wedding which I loved and on the day of we made minor tweaks to get my hair exactly how I wanted to look on my big day! Netanya was so easy to chat with while she was working and really helped add to the calm ambiance I was trying to keep amongst all the wedding day excitement. All of my bridal party that had their hair done by Netanya loved the way that their hair turned out and she was able to accomplish every ladies different styling request! Also big bonus points for how well my hair stayed, I have hair that is kind of a pain to keep a curl, but my hair did. And even after hours of dancing in the rain outside (because it did rain, and yes, we did dance through all of it) my braids still looked perfect and though the curls began to fall, my hair still looks amazing in all the photos! I can't thank Netanya enough for her services provided on my big day!

Her procedures and workflows are user friendly and convenient. I was also amazed at how well the hairstyles held up throughout the entire day and evening. No adjustments or touch-ups required for the full 10 hours! Do yourself a favor and book Netanya for your bridal styling!

The search for a talented beauty expert you feel you can trust for such a big-deal occasion as your Wedding can already be a daunting task, but when you factor in having very uncoo...

perative, "bratty" hair such as mine, I was getting a little panicky and sad about my seemingly limited options for Wedding-worthy hair for my Big Day. I called MANY hair and beauty stylists during my research, and Netanya was BY FAR the most responsive, right from my first call to her. She was so kind, friendly and approachable, and remained incredibly accessible and communicative throughout the entire lead-up to my Wedding. When I had my hairstyle trial with her, it was gorgeous, but it did bring to light the specific aspects in which my personal hair is lacking - It's baby-fine and on the thinner side, won't hold a curl, loosens and falls out of all styles quickly, produces tons of whispy fly-aways, and basically doesn't do ANYthing anyone wants it to do! Netanya worked tirelessly with me to figure out products, styles, and tricks of the trade in order to make my hair look like it's the most cooperative, luxurious hair anyone could wish for, ESPECIALLY for their Wedding Day! During our "research and development phase", I decided to purchase a wig-style "topper" to experiment with, to add some extra bulk on the top so there'd be more to work with, tease, and add volume to my crown area, and I was extra impressed that she was willing to take on the task of figuring out how to hide the topper line... you could absolutely not tell AT ALL that there was anything other than just my own real hair sitting up there! And on the Big Day, my hair did not budge an inch! It also didn't feel too tight and give me a headache, and I have no idea how she managed both of those aspects at once, but it felt like magic! I also really wanted to look extra glamorous in the eyelash department, but was very hesitant to go with falsies for my Wedding Day, as I've never worn them before, and I was worried not only about the "learning curve", but also about them starting to slip or fall, and having to take time away from the festivities to go fix them, as I've heard and seen so many of my girlfriends have to deal with. I was very uninformed about eyelash extensions, and the idea of a "semi-permanent" adhesion to my lashes made me nervous. Netanya took the time to really explain to me how they work, told me different options, and we also did a trial run of those well before the Wedding, to see if I'd have any reactions to the adhesive, and so that I could get used to them before the Big Day if I decided to go for it. SO glad I did! Not only was mascara running during the Ceremony one less thing to worry about, but I loved just rolling out of bed every day on our Honeymoon and feeling glamorous without having to do anything! I have never felt so beautiful and glamorous as I did with expertise of the amazing Netanya, and would whole-heartedly recommend her for any occasion you have coming up! (Even just to treat yourself with a new cut and style, as I did after we got back from our Honeymoon).

I booked Netanya for my October 2022 wedding and she did a fantastic job! She has a very professional quoting/billing set up and takes the business side of thing seriously, which I...

really appreciate. She worked with me to try 2 styles during my trial, and she works very fast! I was very happy with my wedding hair and my curls lasted all night long.

Working with Netanya was the best experience! Even though I was getting married across the country, she was very helpful and communicative along the way. She was willing to try two...

different styles, when I wasn't sure which one to go with! She ended up giving me a beautiful style that was able to withstand the wind on the sailboat! Her salon is also really beautiful and comfortable. Would recommend!!

Netanya is an absolute hair WIZARD. I thought my hair was stunning after my trial, but the actual day-of style was even more beautiful. Her braiding skills are unparalleled. She's ...

also very professional and easy to work with, and I recommend her to anyone looking for a bridal style.

Netanya came thru with my hair style. I wanted a more natural flow low bun with some lose hairs. She understood the assignment. I am an indecisive person when it comes to hairstyle...

s. She really made that hairdo last all night. It looked perfect throughout all the photos, dancing, and hugging. One thing only to complain about would be to have more hair tools for different hair lengths to make sure all the clients leave happy and satisfied.

Thank you so much for the feedback! I appreciate the kind words about your bridal style! I...

am so happy to hear it was beautiful all night! I was prepared for the styles discussed upon the consultation, but was not aware I would be styling a pixie cut. I request the length of everyone's hair receiving services beforehand so I can bring what I need day of. I apologize that some clients were unhappy. My goal is to make sure everyone loves their hair and feels confident for the special day.

This is LONG overdue as our wedding was October 2020; however, every time I look at our photos I am once again floored by how beautiful my hair + makeup was thanks to Netanya. Neta...

nya did my hair + makeup for our engagement shoot in August 2020 as well as our wedding. Not only did she do a wonderful job with my hair + makeup, but also for my mother, mother in law & my sister. She really went above and beyond creating looks that fit their personalities & wants perfectly. Netanya is THE QUEEN of braids & can make all your Rapunzel dreams come true! I highly recommend Netanya for all your special events!
