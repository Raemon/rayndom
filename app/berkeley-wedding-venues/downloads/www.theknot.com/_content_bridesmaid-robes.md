## Where to Buy Wedding Robes for Bridesmaids

So many retailers, yet so little time. When shopping online for bridal party robes, the sheer number of options can get overwhelming quickly. To make finding the dreamiest robes easier, I've rounded up five bridesmaid robe stores that offer the best styles, the best quality and the best prices. 

[**Birdy Grey**](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=9ibcrDa*U1o&mid=44848&u1=TK-bridesmaid-robes&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.birdygrey.com%2Fcollections%2Fbridesmaid-robes): We all love them for their $99 [bridesmaid dresses](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridesmaid-dresses-online), but did you know Birdy Grey offers plenty of bridesmaid robes too? The retailer has a lovely collection of floral, solid and lace designs in an impressive selection of hues. Shoppers rave about the wide range of personalization options and inclusive sizes, which range from XS to 3X. Even better? Buying more will help you save money: When you get four or more bridesmaid robes, you'll get 10% off your order.

[**Etsy**](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6220&awinaffid=565019&campaign=&clickref=TK-bridesmaid-robes&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2F%3Fref%3Dlgo&platform=pl): Etsy carries one of the largest selections of bridesmaid and maid-of-honor robes in so many styles, fabrics and hues, many of which are designed by small businesses or independent artisans. For your convenience, some shops sell Etsy bridesmaid robe sets in bulk at a discounted rate, which is especially useful if you have a large wedding party.

[**Azazie**](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=88935&awinaffid=565019&campaign=&clickref=TK-bridesmaid-robes&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.azazie.com%2Fall%2Frobes%3Fsort_by%3Dpopularity&platform=pl): You know Azazie as the bridesmaid dress store that has hundreds of colors and silhouettes, and I'm happy to report that their robe selection is no different. Not only are Azazie's bridesmaid robes budget-friendly, their extensive palette makes it easy to find styles that coordinate with your wedding palette. 

[**Printfresh**](https://printfresh.com/collections/robes): For wedding robes bridesmaids will love and wear again and again, Printfesh is a can't-miss spot. You'll find short and long styles in a range of unique patterns—think everything from chic tigers to champagne towers. (PSA for brides: If you're shopping for yourself too, don't miss the iconic [Happily Ever After print](https://printfresh.com/products/happily-ever-after-luna-robe-cloud).) Although the prices skew higher for these bridesmaid robes, they'd make a great standalone gift or can serve as the statement piece in your [wedding party proposal box](https://www.theknot.com/content/creative-ways-to-ask-bridesmaids). 

[**Kennedy Blue**](https://www.kennedyblue.com/collections/bridal-and-bridesmaid-robes): You'll find plenty of lovely satin, lace-lined and ruffled wedding party robes at Kennedy Blue. With over 20 colors to pick from and inclusive sizing, your 'maids will definitely appreciate whatever style you choose.
