### The Whitehall Houston

Whether it's at the in-house art gallery, walking paths that loop around a lovely fountain, or near the picture-worthy staircase, there are several places to find a private spot at[ The Whitehall Houston](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g56003-d99116-Reviews-The_Whitehall_Houston-Houston_Texas.html).

"As a photographer, I always tell my clients to find somewhere with meaning to y'all as a couple," said Boehm, when asked about the best places in Houston to propose. "That might be the first place you met, your favorite dinner restaurant, or even a fun activity to do together making memories. Coming from a photographer's standpoint I always look for the best lighting and best backgrounds."

## The Best Time of Year for a Houston Proposal

"As we all know Houston weather is unpredictable at times," Boehm said. "Houston is the perfect place for spring or winter proposals. Spring prompts beautiful blooms and gorgeous trees. Wintertime brings in all the twinkly lights. Almost every street in Houston will be lit up with strands of lights and probably some Christmas trees."
