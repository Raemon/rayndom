Our wedding was the most magical experience. From the first conversation with our wedding coordinator we were able to share our vision for the day. Both Lisa and Jennifer who were ...

our main point of contacts were able to help us curate our special day exactly as we had envisioned. The weather took a turn for the worse on the morning of our wedding, Jennifer was able to help us come up with a back up plan in case of rain. It was seem-less and the staff were able to set up an indoor ceremony within minutes. As we said our vows the sun came out and right after the ceremony the staff quickly moved the champagne and canapés to the deck so that guest could enjoy the sun. The bridal suite upstairs was stunning and we enjoyed sometime up there before the ceremony. All the little touches that Mavericks House provided are really nice, the bathroom had a basket of useful things like hair spray & cotton and many thoughtful items. Our day was so beautiful, every detail made our wedding so perfect. All the staff were so polite and worked around our timeline so well. Our idea was to have an intimate ceremony with our close family and friends. That is exactly what we got, the messages that we received the next day from our guests were amazing. Both my husband and I would highly recommend this venue for your special event, large or small. Melissa & John Marshall ❤️ 10/26/25

Our wedding at Mavericks House was everything we imagined and more. We had the very ambitious goal of finding a coastal venue in the Bay Area that was easy to access for out of tow...

n guests and could accommodate our guest list of 150+ people, while not grossly exceeding our modest budget. This was a big ask for the location, but we found it in Mavericks House. Half Moon Bay serves as an extension of the venue and we were able to host all of our wedding activities, including rehearsal dinner and afterparty at restaurants/bars within walking distance of Mavericks House. The venue itself is just stunning. You don't need much in way of decorations, because the setting has so much natural beauty. Finally, I cannot speak highly enough of the staff working at Mavericks House, specifically Crystal and Lisa. They were easy to communicate with, knowledgeable about the wedding process, and seamless day of coordinators. To us, the wedding was perfect and we cannot recommend Mavericks House highly enough!

Food, drinks, service were all great. And the photos came out very well too! We could not have asked for more.

Mavericks House is a hidden gem. Nestled in the cozy nook of Half Moon Bay near the Oceano Hotel & Spa, the venue is amazing; with beautiful bay ocean views, a newly renovated boat...

house reception area (with an outdoor deck) and an amazing new bridal suite, the venue was equipped to host our perfect wedding in September 2024! No one prepared my husband and I for the wedding planning process, especially finding a venue since that is one of the first things on the list. There were many we looked at around California, but when we found Mavericks, it was clear to us that this venue had it all, especially the best staff team on the planet. From the moment we inquired, to the tour, to the tasting, and all the way through the end of our wedding night, Brittani, Lisa and the rest of the Mavericks House staff were sensational. The process was so easy with them; all costs and pricing were transparent, communication was timely, and questions were all answered throughout the year or so of planning. Which resulted in our wedding day being absolutely seamless! It is a joy to look back and think about everything that went right, because with all the prep we did with Mavericks House, really nothing went wrong the day-of. One of the biggest callouts was the food, as that was the most-loved part of our wedding day (besides the ocean views) by our guests. The tasting was amazing, as the Half Moon Bay Brewing Co provides so many great options (as well as GF and VEG), and the food on our wedding day was even better! It was actually so good that the entire wedding party and most of the guests went to the HMB Brewing Co for brunch! If you’re looking for a venue that really has it all, look no further. Our experience was perfect, and we hope anyone looking for the right wedding/event venue finds it with Mavericks House!

ck’s. This was my first flip as a Planner, and I was adamantly a bit nervous about completing a full transition within 90 minutes (for those of you who do not know what a flip is, it is when we transition a ceremony site into a reception/dinner site) all while guests enjoy cocktail hour and watch. I was so impressed with how smoothly everything went and how well organized the team was. From the moment the truck arrived with tables and chairs to the quick and efficient set up by all the team members. Working with the Maverick’s staff truly felt like being part of a well oiled machine. Each and every person contributed to the success of the evening and I couldn’t have asked for a better experience as a Planner. The couple had the most perfect day! They went above and beyond for not only the couple but for my team and I and I cannot thank them enough for all the support. Thank you to the entire Staff at Maverick’s and a special shout out to Brittany, Annie & Lisa for their exceptional support and communication throughout the entire process. Every single person went above and beyond to ensure a smooth day for the couple! They’re incredible and I can’t wait to work them again! Highly recommend this venue.

ct, was incredibly responsive and helpful throughout the entire process, ensuring that we were always up-to-date on deadlines, payments, and required documentation/forms. The venue's payment schedule and pricing structure were transparent and easy to understand, and the payment portal made transactions simple and convenient. The portal also let us refer to current and past documents at any time, making planning much easier. One of the highlights of our experience was the delicious food and drinks provided by the venue. The menu we chose offered a variety of options, including 3 cocktail hour appetizers, starter salad, 3 different mains, 2 sides, a churro bar, wine list, beer list, and His/Hers signature cocktails. The tasting process to choose our menu and drink list was not only enjoyable but also helped us customize our selections to our preferences. During the tasting, we also chose tablecloth/napkin colors, table configurations, and many other details for our wedding. They also took into consideration our guests with sensitive food allergies. We needed accommodations for gluten free, nut free, and shellfish free guests. Our guests with these allergies said the staff were very helpful and provided food they could enjoy. One thing that truly set this venue apart was their accommodation for guests who didn't drink. They allowed us to have two His/Hers signature cocktails and a mocktail, ensuring that everyone had a special drink option. Additionally, they provided Martinelli sparkling cider in addition to champagne for our toast, catering to our non-drinking guests. Throughout our wedding day, the staff provided full support and assistance when necessary, including helping us set up our DIY decor/centerpieces. Whenever we wanted to get more drinks from the bar, a staff member made us feel special by getting our drinks quickly, making us feel like the VIPs of our event! Since we were busy taking photos during our cocktail hour, at dinner, the staff provided us with a sampler plate of the appetizers we missed during cocktail hour, which was very thoughtful! At the end of the night, clean up was a breeze as the staff quickly and efficiently helped us clean up well before our 11pm cut-off time. Overall, our experience with Mavericks House was wonderful, and we highly recommend them to anyone looking for a picturesque venue that offers great food, drinks, and exceptional service.

PRAISE FOR LISA GRAYE, the Events Manager, who helped us not only plan every detail from A-Z, but during a pandemic! She was always the consummate professional ~ upbeat, genuinely welcoming, endlessly patient, 100% responsive and seamlessly able to trouble-shoot last minute dilemmas (it started to drizzle right before our outdoor ceremony). Our menu tasting was ever so slightly better than the food turned out to be the day of the wedding, but honestly, we were so pleased with all other aspects of Mavericks House, it wasn't of concern. Mavericks House is a true gem!

My husband and I held our wedding at the Mavericks Event Center on June 10th, 2017. From the initial meeting at one of their open houses, the team was absolutely amazing. I met wit...

h Jodie and Melanie to confirm our date and make general decisions over several months, and then Lisa Graye took over to finalize all the details. Jodie and Melanie were extremely accommodating and communicative, and then Lisa ensured all our needs and concerns were addressed. During the rehearsal, Lisa was just lovely with my family, she helped us to organize our ceremony schedule (we needed it!), and answered all our last minute questions. On the day of the wedding day, she made sure everything was accounted for. I was also so impressed with the staff who were professional, welcoming, and on top of food, drinks, lighting and transitions throughout the entire event. The ceremony grounds were neat and clean, the event center was beautifully arranged, and the schedule went seamlessly! All I had to worry about at our wedding was my vows and spending as much time as I could with our guests. The beer is from the Half Moon Bay Brew Co, which owns this venue. Their beer is excellent and such a treat to offer to our guests. We chose to bring in our own wine and the corkage fee was very reasonable. The only area of improvement was the dinner, though this was fully addressed. Full disclosure - My husband is a Chef so we have high expectations, and several of our guests were Chefs as well! Fortunately, when we shared our concerns, we were offered a second tasting, and Mavericks Chef graciously met with us to review all our changes and recommendations. The day of the wedding, the food was even better than our second tasting, and many of our guests commented on how much they enjoyed their meal, as did we! I am so thankful to the staff at Mavericks Event Center for helping us to realize our vision for our wedding day.
