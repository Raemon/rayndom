Plus, we've compiled 25 editor-approved picks for wedding guest accessories you can shop right now. 

**In this article:** What You Need | How to Choose | Jewelry | Hair Accessories | FAQ

## What Wedding Guest Accessories Do I Need to Complete My Outfit?

When curating your wedding guest look, accessories are an important finishing touch that can elevate any outfit. Whether it's a chic [wedding guest purse](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-guest-purse) or stylish [wedding guest shoes](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-guest-shoes), selecting the right accessories to go with your outfit is crucial for creating a stylish look. To help you get started, we spoke with [Kenzie Welch](https://www.instagram.com/stylingwithkenzie/?hl=en), fashion stylist and wardrobe consultant, for her expert advice on choosing the perfect accessories for a wedding guest. You may recognize her from her viral [TikTok styling videos](https://www.tiktok.com/@stylingwithkenzie?lang=en), where her more than a million followers look to her for sage wisdom to help curate the wardrobes of their dreams.

"Statement accessories are always a nice touch to an elevated occasion," Welch says. "I recommend beaded or sleek clutches instead of handbags, statement or sparkle jewelry and, of course, personal touches like brooches, unique ties or textured fabrics."

## How to Choose Wedding Guest Accessories

Choosing the perfect wedding guest accessories comes down to a combination of the event and your own personal style. If you're unsure [what to wear to a wedding](https://www.theknot.com/content/what-to-wear-to-a-wedding), jazz up your trusty black dress with some new accessories to give it a new life—the possibilities are endless!

### Outfit Color & Style

One of the first things to pay attention to when shopping for wedding guest accessories is the color and style of your [wedding guest dress](https://www.theknot.com/content/where-to-buy-wedding-guest-dresses). You can opt for complimentary or monochromatic colors for your accessories for a simpler look or go bold with a striking contrasting hue—think back to your color wheel days in art class. The color of your accessories can totally transform your look. Creating a Pinterest board for inspiration can be a helpful place to get started saving colors and styles that speak to you. When in doubt, you can never go wrong with either gold or silver accessories that tie into your jewelry. 

### Season

The season of the wedding is an important factor in choosing the right accessories. For example, a simple LBD can be worn year-round and styled differently depending on the season. A [summer wedding](https://www.theknot.com/content/what-to-wear-summer-wedding) outfit is going to look very different from [winter wedding](https://www.theknot.com/content/what-to-wear-to-a-winter-wedding) attire. 

"Depending on the dress code and season of the wedding, I like to tell clients to pay attention to the small details such as color or texture," Welch explains. "For example, if the wedding is in the summer season, then raffia clutches or pastel hues are great for styling. And if the wedding is in the fall or winter season, then suede or leather textures are perfect for accessorizing your outfit. Same goes for shoes—in the spring and summer months, you want to stick to open-toe shoes, and then in the fall or winter, you can opt for an open toe, but a closed-toe heel is appropriate."

### Dress Code

Accessories can help to dress a look up or down, depending on the formality or [dress code](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-guest-attire-cheat-sheet). High heels and elegant jewelry are perfect for a [black-tie](https://www.theknot.com/content/what-to-wear-black-tie) or [formal wedding](https://www.theknot.com/content/formal-wedding-attire), but may be a bit overly formal for a more casual wedding. Pay attention to the dress code and don't be afraid to reach out to the couple or another guest if you're unsure what is appropriate. "Wearing casual accessories to a formal event is a big no," Welch tells us. "Avoid sneakers, hats and leave the Apple Watch at home!"

### Wedding Guest Accessories Mistakes to Avoid

There are a few common wedding guest mistakes you should avoid when choosing your accessories. "Wearing white or bridal-style accessories is a big one," Welch tells us. "I recommend avoiding styles with pearls or white lace and instead, stick to colorful or neutral styles."

"Over-accessorizing is another mistake I've seen guests make. Let the couple have their moment and keep your accessories to a minimum, especially if you are going to wear a statement handbag or jewelry."

## Wedding Guest Jewelry Ideas

While it can be easy to skip over, choosing the correct wedding guest jewelry to complete your look can create a world of difference. Even the simplest of styles can help to elevate your look beyond what you might wear every day. From maximal and bold to chic and understated, there are countless stylish jewelry options out there to suit every guest's wedding day style—even the option to [rent jewelry](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-to-rent-wedding-jewelry).

"I recommend simple sparkle jewelry, colorful statement styles, and/or minimal gold or silver jewelry," Welch says. "Jewelry is a great way to add personality to your look, just make sure it follows a formal or casual dress code."

## Wedding Guest Accessories FAQ

Have more questions about wearing accessories for your wedding guest outfit? From how to style a black dress to whether it's bad luck to wear pearls, here are answers to the most frequently asked questions. 

### Can wedding guests wear hair accessories?

The short answer: yes! While we'd recommend you steer clear of anything too bridal (think pearls, white and satin), we absolutely support guests who want to rock a stylish hair accessory to complete their look.

### How to accessorize a black dress for a wedding?

A black dress is the perfect blank canvas to have fun with your accessories. We're particularly fond of a metallic monochrome moment with your accessories, but a colorful pair of earrings or statement heels also works. The styling possibilities are endless, so you can totally transform your favorite black dress for years to come. 

### Can you wear gold or silver jewelry to a wedding?

Yes—in fact, we recommend sticking to either gold or silver if you're not sure where to start with your accessories. You can also opt for a bold mixed metal look if you're looking to switch things up.

### Can you wear pearls to a wedding?

A commonly asked question is whether [pearls are bad luck at a wedding](https://www.theknot.com/content/whats-the-tradition-behind-wearing-pearls). While there have been some negative connotations and superstitions with pearls throughout history, we're here to bust that myth. Rest assured, if you feel confident and beautiful in pearls, they are perfectly appropriate for a wedding. With that being said, use your judgement and try not to choose anything too bridal, as when choosing your wedding accessories for guests.
