Business Owner

I purchased Moxie’s Frozen Yogurt from a bookkeeping client in June 2019, not knowing the challenges that lay ahead. Just four months later, our town was evacuated due to the Kincade Fire, which left our store with smoke damage. After a week of cleanup, we reopened full time, only to face another major hurdle, the pandemic. Like many restaurants, we adapted to ever changing regulations and came out stronger than before. My love for desserts and creativity started long before Moxie’s. While raising my three young sons, I decorated wedding cakes for extra income, which allowed me to be a stay-at-home mom until they started grade school. Later, I built my own bookkeeping business, which eventually led me to Moxie’s. When the opportunity arose to purchase the shop, I knew it was the perfect fit, a chance to blend my business expertise with my passion for sweet treats. In 2022, we decided to expand and bring Moxie to more people. That dream became a reality with Moxie’s Frozen Yogurt Truck! Our truck features six delicious flavors and three twist options, available as either full serve or self serve. We also offer a variety of toppings, giving customers the joy of creating their own perfect, decadent desserts, especially at self-serve events, where we love watching their creativity shine. Moxie’s is more than just a business, it is a family run operation built on hard work, resilience, and a love for serving our community. Whether at our store or from our truck, we take pride in sharing our frozen yogurt with you, made with care by a family who loves what we do.
