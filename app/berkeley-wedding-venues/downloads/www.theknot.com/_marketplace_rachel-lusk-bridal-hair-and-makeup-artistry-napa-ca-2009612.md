Rachel was absolutely incredible to work with! She did my makeup for both our welcome party and wedding day, and I truly felt so beautiful. Not only that, but she also worked her m...

agic on my sister’s hair and makeup, making sure we both looked and felt our best. Rachel has such a calm, steady energy that made getting ready on such an emotional day feel relaxed and enjoyable. She’s a true artist—she listened to what each of us wanted and created looks that were flawless yet natural, which was so important to me. My makeup held up perfectly through all the happy tears and dancing, which is no small feat! I’m so grateful to Rachel for helping make our day so special, and I’d recommend her to anyone looking for a talented and thoughtful makeup artist.

I am so incredibly grateful for Rachel and cannot say enough kind words about her! I felt confident and beautiful on my wedding day while still looking and feeling like myself. Bet...

ween my hair and makeup trial and the wedding day, I spent quite some time in Rachel's chair, and she was always so kind, calming, and the energy you need on your wedding day. I fully trusted her to take the inspiration I had and create a look that suited me, and she even came to the wedding day with ideas on how to improve on the look I already loved from our trial. There was a heat wave on the day of my wedding (almost 100 degrees!), and my hair and makeup lasted all day and night. I can't imagine my wedding day (or wedding photos) without Rachel!

I emailed this lady back in June of 2024 for a wedding in December of 2025. Only one response nothing after. Bad business practice. Shame on you!

ng and positive energy, which is exactly what every bride needs. She was very bride focused which made me feel like a princess on my wedding day! The hair and makeup? Absolutely flawless! Rachel enhanced my natural beauty in a way that made me feel like the best version of myself. It was an elevated version of natural. My look held up perfectly through hours of happy tears, hugs, and dancing the night away. I received countless compliments, and I felt stunning in every single photo. Thank you, Rachel, for making me feel so confident and beautiful on such an important day. If you're looking for a talented, professional, and genuinely wonderful person, look no further!

Let me start with WOW, Rachel is truly amazing at her craft! She is the utmost professional--knowledgable, skillful, and incredibly kind. She does both hair and makeup (amazing!). ...

We absolutely put her skills to the test given that my wedding was in 95 degree Napa heat, and I can share that her work surpassed our wildest dreams. My makeup looked just as flawless at the end of the night as it did the morning of my wedding! I also consider myself to be pretty picky when it comes to makeup (because I seldom wear any in my daily routine) and Rachel made me look gorgeous and glowing, but most importantly, still like ME. She cares so, so much about her brides and it was a true pleasure to work with her. I will absolutely be recommending her to all of my gal pals!!

most genuinely kind and ready to help person to have by my side on my wedding day. I have never felt more beautiful and well taken care of than with Rachel. We just got sneak peak photos too and wow I am blown away by myself which is thanks to her. She was so helpful assisting with touch-ups during our first look and family photos and made sure everything was picture perfect. She was also always there to help me when my tiny bridal party was busy being social and helped with me my train and whatever else she could. She was absolutely amazing and I could not recommend her more.

he listens to what you want, and the final look on my wedding day was absolutely perfect- So romantic, timeless, and made it look effortless. She is a excellent communicator, and responds to emails so quickly. We had a little rain briefly visit us after the ceremony, and it was amazing how my hair and makeup lasted the entire day even after that! On top of that I am a naturally very oily person but she was able to give me great info on how to take care and prep my skin before the big day. My makeup and hair stayed super fresh/ amazing (she also gives you a little freshen up kit). I got so many compliments on it. Rachel is amazing!

We were able to hold my preview for the rehearsal dinner and I felt so at ease and comfortable with Rachel. Rachel and her assistant are so talented and it made my wedding morning so easy (and she stayed ahead of the timeline)! Everyone was in-love with their hair and make up. I cannot say enough good things about working with Rachel. Thank you Rachel!!

my wedding and booked her immediately for rehearsal dinner AND wedding hair and makeup. She was very communicative and organized throughout the entire process. And she provided a detailed hair and makeup day-of timeline, which made the getting ready process run smooth for the 8 women in my group. Rachel and her partner (who she brought in for bridesmaid hair) were even ahead on their timeline which was amazing. Makeup and hair lasted throughout the entire day and night. Thank you Rachel!

o we didn’t get to do a trial, however I shared my vision board and had a phone conversation with Rachel to be sure we were on the same page. This was extremely key! She did an amazing job on all of our services, was extremely clean and neat and listened to each of our visions. She was also very calm in a chaotic “getting ready” hotel suite! Without a doubt I recommend Rachel Lusk for hair and makeup.

ving a trial but Rachel was so wonderful to work with and kept my mind at ease. I had a call with her as well as a few emails about what I liked and dislike for wedding makeup and hair. We kept in touch all the months leading up to the wedding. She was always so quick to respond and was very professional and helpful with her suggestions. On the wedding day Rachel made everything so calm and was flawless on hair and make up. She even taught me some new tricks with the face mask before my make up and the hair paste they kept my hair perfect through the entire day. (I didn’t want to take it out of the end of the night because it still looked so good!) I wouldn’t change a thing about my wedding day! I highly recommend Rachel, and would love to be able to work with her again in the future. I’m so grateful to have had her on our special day! ❤️

or a trial run (on the day of the rehearsal), and on the wedding day for myself and two bridesmaids. She asked for inspiration for each of us and asked good questions before and during the whole process. I threw and extra curveball at her, I have extremely sensitive skin, Rachel sent sample and gave excellent suggestions so I could find the right product for me without suffering an allergic reaction. I love love love what she did for each of us! We still looked like ourselves but an upscale-classy-natural-beautiful-selves. I can’t recommend her enough and hope to work with her again in the future!
