I want to give MAJOR props to Audio Ecstasy for DJ'ing and MC'ing our wedding. We got so many compliments from our guests who loved John's energy and musical choices. We had people...

out on the dance floor all night long! Our videographer even noted how his equipment was perfect for capturing the audio from the ceremony and speeches! John was very responsive and checked in with us throughout the planning process. We spoke with a number of DJs when we were first looking for vendors, but as soon as we spoke to John, we knew that he would be the best person to work with - we just loved his energy/vibe! He really made us feel special and reminded us to soak in the moment. Thank you John and Dianne! Our wedding was perfect!

killed it from the ceremony all the way to the reception. We have had positive feedback from all our guests and one guest even asked who our DJ was and how amazing of a mixer he was! They were very communicative and on time and they put in the effort to make sure we had the wedding that we dreamed of. We cannot recommend them enough! It was an absolute pleasure working their team and I hope for wonderful endeavors to come their way!

As a wedding planner, it's so crucial to trust that you have a great vendor team to make the day spectacular. We worked with John for the first time last year and he's been on our ...

preferred vendors list ever since. As an emcee, he's the perfect balance of upbeat and no-nonsense. As a DJ, he excels at reading the crowd and anticipating the vibe. If some folks need a little encouragement to make it to the dance floor, he's there with the classics you can't say no to. If folks are really feeling the Backstreet Boys, there's more where that came from. He stays current and on-trend, while also listening to clients with specific needs (just recently he did a lovely cocktail hour of worldly jazz and Brazilian bossa nova for a Brazilian bride). We can't say enough great things. Thanks for always delivering!

process and open to our requests. They worked diligently and came up with suggestions to help with the flow of the event. Communication during wedding planning is crucial--and Audio Ecstasy has that down. They reply as soon as possible, which helps move planning forward. During the wedding, the guests really enjoyed themselves as John kept the atmosphere super fun. We undoubtably recommend booking with Audio Ecstasy for any events!

eedless to say, we postponed our large, wedding reception to 2021, and Audio Ecstasy were very easy to work with through the postponement communications and resuming the plans in 2021. They have reasonable options that worked well for our small-medium budget, and we decided to go with them rather than some of the packaged options from our venue for a backdrop photobooth (which John and Dianne manned during together our event) and uplighting around our eating area. Communication was very reliable. John made sure to have a video chat for the initial planning so we could get to know each other and talk more easily. We used email the rest of the way. It was easy to get in touch with him and ask questions ranging from the package to design opinions, and getting transparent quotes. We highly recommend Audio Ecstasy to those in searching of event services that they offer!

ng our reception! We wanted our wedding to play hip hop/party, Spanish, Tagalog, and country music and he did all that. His transition from one genre to the next was on point! The dance floor was lit. We decided to add uplights last minute, and woah what a different vibe and energy those brought to the space. We are so glad we included uplights, it enhanced the room and looked so great! He can turn a blank empty room into a party! John definitely knows how to keep a crowd staying on the dance floor. Thank you for hyping us all night, John and team!

John is a tremendously talented DJ. From our initial meeting, he knows what questions to ask of his clients as well as having us fill out a day of event questionnaire to make sure ...

he was putting together the perfect sound mix for our wedding. He and his crew are very professional and worked flawlessly with spur of the moment changes that occurred during the event. Our wedding happened during COVID and our venue was requiring no group dancing but the music was so good everyone was dancing in small groups spread out. We are in our 30s and we requested a lot of 90s/2000 music and he had such a great selection all ages were dancing. So many friends and family complimented the djs dance music selections during and after the day. We highly recommend John and the Audio Ecstasy team!

Audio Ecstasy was one of our favorite vendors to work with. When we first reached out, we were a little nervous due to issues with some other vendors we reached out to. John met ...

with us personally, and spent the afternoon reassuring us he would make our wedding perfect. Their team did just that! We had an outdoor ceremony, which sounded perfect and allowed everyone to hear. There was no awkwardness with microphones or anything; it was just seamless. During the reception, the background music was perfect and John did a great job emceeing the event and keeping up with the pace. Meanwhile, the photobooth they provided was firing away in the background, letting everyone have a great time. We even got digital copies of every picture to keep for the memories. Our dancing portion was awesome. Nearly every one of our guests made it to the dance floor, and the music was varied enough that everyone was happy, while at the same time our choices were played prominently. Our wedding was perfect, and Audio Ecstasy made it happen!

What's more, the sound was perfectly interfaced with our videographer, making our video sound perfect. During our reception, John did a great job of serving as our emcee, making sure the event went off without a hitch. The music was thoughtfully curated, and included all of our favorites. They also provided us with an awesome photobooth, and we got copies of all of the photographs after the event to enhance our memories. We will never forget our wedding, and it definitely was thanks to Audio Ecstasy!

ng they provided speakers and mics for the ceremony, lighting, DJ/music, MC (more like John your best hype man), the most fun photo booth, & our 1st dance we "danced on clouds"! It made it so much easier for us to go to Audio Ecstasy for all of these things rather than work with even more vendors. What my husband and I loved most about working with Audio Ecstasy, besides them playing GREAT music for us during the reception (music is important to us), was how comfortable John and the team made us feel throughout the planning process and in doing so, showed their true care for the couples they work with and their craft. Thank you John and the rest of the team at Audio Ecstasy for helping make our day so awesome & taking care of our guests. Guests continue to tell us how much they loved the music and photo booth. Don't hesitate - go with Audio Ecstasy for your wedding/event needs! Thank you again, Audio Ecstasy!

Audio Ecstasy came highly recommended from a few of our friends, so we decided to have a free consultation with them. Right off the bat you sensed great energy and enthusiasm from ...

both Dianne and John, both super down to earth people and easy to speak with; you can tell they were genuinely excited and eager to get this wedding planned with our best interest in mind. We went over every little detail from the theme we had in mind, to a certain type of look and decor we wanted; from what genre of music we wanted, to specific song lists; from what type of ambiance we wanted with the lighting, all the way to the type of dance floor we had in mind. You name it, we went over it in detail. We decided to go ahead and book with Audio Ecstasy, the contract signing and deposit payments were all done digitally and secured. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic hit and we decided it would be in our best interest to postpone our wedding with the health and safety of our families in our best interest. We reached out to Dianne and John, they were extremely empathetic with our decision to postpone. We have no doubt in our minds that we want Audio Ecstasy for our wedding when some sort of normalcy returns. We have had nothing but great and professional interactions with Dianne and John during this whole process, we highly recommend Audio Ecstasy!
