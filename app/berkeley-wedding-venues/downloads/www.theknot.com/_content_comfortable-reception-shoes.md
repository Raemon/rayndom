**In this article:** Top 10 | What to Look For | Most Comfortable Bridal Shoes | Where to Buy




## How to Find Comfortable Wedding Shoes

To find the most comfortable wedding shoes, I had to step into the mindset of a bride. I thought about how long brides typically have to be on their feet during the wedding, which, between the ceremony, reception and after party, can often be over eight hours. Next, I thought about the different types of terrain a bride might encounter on their wedding day. An outdoor wedding taking place on sand or grass would require a much different shoe choice than one taking place indoors at, say, a banquet hall. Finally, I thought about how bridal shoes should fit. In my experience, even shoes that you would think are comfy, like flats or sandals, can start to cause pain after some time if they don't have the right amount of support. 

With all of this in mind, I narrowed down the key things to look for in a pair of comfortable bridal shoes:

  * **Arch support:** Since you'll be on your feet for most of the day, look for a shoe with adequate arch support that will help distribute your body weight properly. This will alleviate that nagging pain in your feet's arches and help maintain your posture.
  * **Foam padding and cushioning:** Always select shoes with ample padding in the footbed and insole for walkability and overall balance. This will reduce the impact of each step and is crucial for preventing pain in the ball of your foot and providing increased support.
  * **Range of width and overall fit:** To ensure you have the correct sizing for your feet, opt for a brand that offers different width styles and a roomy toe box. Narrow shoes or pointed-toe boxes are especially harmful for wide feet. Not only do they cause pain, but they can also squeeze your toes together, leading to long-term foot issues.



Based on your comfort preferences, including arch support, foam padding and a range of widths, it's important to look for keywords to ensure that shoes are designed with proper fit in mind. For sufficient padding that reduces the overall impact on your feet, look for the words "gel" or "air cushioning," "shock absorption," "memory foam" and "foam padding." To ensure proper midfoot support, look for "arch support," "contoured footbeds," "anatomical design," and "EVA midsoles." To avoid ill-fitting shoes, look for "flexibility," "adjustable straps," "wide" or "narrow width options" and "extended sizing." Lastly, other keywords that indicate comfort are "anti-slip," "lightweight," and "breathable."

Beach brides, listen up. If you're planning a ceremony on the sand, you'll need to skip the classic stilettos and pumps.

Searching for the perfect pair of kitten heels that you can wear throughout your bridal era? Opt for these comfortable wedding shoes by Tony Bianco. Their adjustable ankle straps will ensure they don't slip off while you're showing off your moves on the dance floor. Plus, they have a padded footbed for added comfort. Trust me: You'll love them so much that you might even want to grab them in the two other neutral color options they come in.

**Size range:** 5–10 | **Heel type:** Stiletto | **Heel height:** 2.5 in. | **Colors:** 3

**The review that sold us:** "These heels are perfection! I bought them in black, white, & tan. They are so comfortable & easy to walk in. The heels look amazing on, so feminine and sexy. I was nervous about the thin strap, but it holds well. The width is more on the narrow side. A 2.5-inch heel height is amazing, so it's hard to find sexy heels at this height. The sizing is true. I'm a true 8 & 8 fits great. Seriously, my dream heels!" –Tracey, [revolve.com](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=2866X1446373&isjs=1&jv=15.9.1&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theknot.com%2Fcontent%2Fcomfortable-reception-shoes&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhowl.me%2FcmixgGuxa5N%3Fu1%3Dxid%3Afr1757683676192eie&xs=1&xtz=240&xuuid=83ce372aec31486af80ace85f9d35596&xjsf=other_click__contextmenu%20%5B2%5D)
