### About this venue

The Hibernia is a unique, historic wedding and event venue located in the heart of San Francisco, CA. Originally constructed in 1892, the building is the cornerstone of the city's storied Mid-Market neighborhood. This iconic treasure is a grand example of Beaux Arts architecture – the style originally introduced to San Francisco by the architect, Albert Pissis. With its prominent corner location and dramatic stained glass dome, it’s been a beloved San Francisco landmark for over 125 years. The Main Hall is dressed to impress, with a soaring 30-foot ceiling, massive arched windows, and ornately gilded fixtures—it's a truly striking celebration room. Downstairs, though, you’ll find something completely different: an industrial-chic, warehouse-style space with a distinct nightclub vibe. Move up, up, up to the Penthouse and Roof Deck for yet another unforgettable experience. Here, you’ll dine and dance surrounded by the Mid-Market skyline, with a breathtaking, close-up view of the building’s colorful dome. Be sure to check out the gallery for an exclusive 360° Virtual Tour!

e is the most beautiful venue we have been a part of so far, and not just because it was our wedding reception. People thanked me after the event, including many architects, saying it was something out of a storybook and dream. The venue is worth every penny. \- On the night itself, the Hibernia team worked with us to find a place for us to get dressed and use the rooftop for wedding photos and a place to get away from the chaos. They gave the top floor to us at fair value as well. Needless to say, this was a very kind gesture and another way the team went above and beyond. \- Next, the venue offers many bartenders all stationed around the back of the bar. They did a phenomenal job to a point that NO ONE waited for a single drink because of the incredible organization by the team. \- Some members of the Hibernia team really went above and beyond to make this night one night to remember! So thank you Terry, Cali, Eli, and Carrie for being incredible to work with, flexible through the night, and incredibly accommodating leading up to the big night and even after the event happened. \- Overall, I give The Hibernia a 5 STARTS A++ RATING for it's historic and mesmerizing venue, outstanding customer service from the team, and that magical ability to create a perfect night regardless of what you are celebrating there. P.S.- Also happy to be a reference if anyone wants to reach out to me about planning an event there. This is definitely the place you want to be if you plan on getting married, having a reception, or even do a large social or corporate event.

n absolute delight to work with. First and foremost, the team at the Hibernia was incredibly responsive and attentive to our needs. They listened carefully to our vision for the event and went above and beyond to ensure that every detail was executed flawlessly. Our guests were in awe as they were greeted with valet, walked up the red carpet, and entered into this beautiful interior enhanced by Jason's amazing light work. One aspect that truly stood out was their accommodation of our ideas. They not only welcomed our creative input but also provided valuable suggestions and guidance to enhance our vision even further. It was evident that they were genuinely invested in making our event memorable and unique. Moreover, the Hibernia proved to be the easiest vendor to work with throughout the entire planning process. Their professionalism, efficiency, and proactive approach made the experience stress-free and enjoyable. I also want to commend the Hibernia for their commitment to helping us stick to our budget. They offered cost-effective solutions without compromising on quality or service. This level of transparency and integrity was truly refreshing and greatly appreciated. Additionally, our other vendors echoed our sentiments and expressed how much they enjoyed collaborating with the Hibernia team. Their seamless coordination and teamwork contributed to the overall success of the event. In conclusion, I wholeheartedly recommend the Hibernia to anyone seeking a venue for their special occasion. Their responsiveness, accommodation, encouragement of ideas, and dedication to staying within budget set them apart as a top-notch establishment in the industry. Thank you to the entire team at the Hibernia for making our reception an unforgettable experience! Decor by: @specialmomentsdecorr

From start to finish, our experience at The Hibernia was great! It started with a tour where we were shown the entire building and were able to discuss date options with staff. We ...

knew right away that this was the perfect venue for our wedding - the building is absolutely gorgeous, with beautiful details throughout and a rooftop deck that was perfect for our cocktail hour. Staff at The Hibernia were able to work with us to put together a package that met our requirements and budget. Throughout the months leading up to the wedding, they were helpful in getting prepared, including working with our caterer to order all necessary glassware and doing a final walkthrough a few weeks before the event. On the day of our wedding, The Hibernia's day-of coordinator Eli was with us from start to finish and really helped the day run smoothly. He worked with vendors as they arrived and made sure that things progressed on schedule. At the end of the night, he and his staff graciously offered to finish the cleanup so that we could go out and celebrate with our friends. Our guests raved about the beautiful building, great bar service, and central location! We'd highly recommend The Hibernia, and we hope we have a chance to hope to host (or at least attend) another event here.

The Hibernia was the perfect place to host our August 2023 wedding reception. We looked at venues all across the Bay Area, and the Hibernia was the best ballroom around by a mile. ...

It's a well kept secret - we were shocked we were able to get a booking given how amazing it is on the inside! No hotel ballroom, this; soaring stained glass domes, high ceilings, columns, marble counters, floors, and more. It delivered a level of old-world elegance that was perfect for our celebration. We turned the brick basement into a speakeasy for our cocktail hour full of funky drinks and music, then brought our guests up the staircase for a grand reveal of the ballroom. The size was perfect for our 220 guests, who danced the night away. We loved the acoustics: the soundproofing completely hid the noise of San Francisco, leaving us in our own world. The room amplified and accommodated our live band without a hitch. And, we were able to party past midnight!

day. I wasn't involved in the planning of this extravaganza, but the execution was flawless. Kudos to Daniel, Alden, and all the staff. I had no idea The Hibernia had been converted into such a spectacular venue. The space was beautiful and everyone enjoyed themselves. We couldn't have asked for anything more.

The Hibernia is an absolute gem in the heart of San Francisco. Our reception went perfectly thanks to Daniel and Alden, who were thoughtful, communicative, and flexible from day on...

e. They helped us get logistics right for a cocktail hour in the 1 Jones space, then a reception upstairs in the main hall with five different performances on top of the normal wedding activities! Our vendors and coordinator were able to get all their questions answered, load in and prep, and do their job seamlessly. My dancers and performers and I had a whole beautiful space upstairs to get ready and take a breather when we needed to. I could go on and on honestly, I had so much fun and have nothing but good things to say. Also, the Hibernia invested in really nice furniture, upgraded the acoustics in the main hall, and had a lot of other small touches that made the venue feel extra luxurious for our guests. Our wedding had 120 people, so even though the Hibernia can hold a lot more, the spaces can be roped off or organized so it feels right for a small or large event. We also saved a lot on decor since the place is so beautiful—I had minimal flowers and rented some lighting from the venue and it looked fantastic!
