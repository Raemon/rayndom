I had the absolute pleasure of working with Ella and her co-artist Michael for my wedding hair and makeup, and I cannot recommend them enough. They were both incredibly kind, patie...

nt, and thoughtful, and truly did everything within their power to make not only me, but also my mother and sister, feel beautiful and confident on not one, but both of my wedding days. Ella and Michael created two distinct yet equally stunning looks—one for my Indian wedding ceremony and another for my Western ceremony—perfectly honoring the style, tone, and vision of each celebration. I genuinely enjoyed working with them throughout the process. Ella was especially amazing at calming my nerves on my wedding day, and she listened so carefully to all of my input and feedback, making sure I felt completely myself and comfortable every step of the way. Their talent, professionalism, and warmth made such a difference in my wedding experience, and I am so grateful to have had them as part of such a special moment. I would highly recommend Ella and Michael to any bride looking for artists who truly care and deliver beautiful results.

y. She also recommended what hair piece I should get (because I totally forgot!). Day of, she was professional, kind, and made everyone feel super confident. I felt so radiant all day and was happy that everything held up, and it felt ME. She handled a variety of hair types and skin tones without question. She adjusted to our early morning start time and happily accommodated our last-minute addition to do the flower girl's hair. On top of her talent, she was such a calming, positive presence on the wedding morning. I love how she was able to balance getting all the girls done on time, but also being an anchor for me in the craziness! I cannot recommend her highly enough.

I got my hair and make up done for my wedding and it was more then what i could have imagined i would ever look like, on my big day. My experience was totally unforgettably amazing...

. She arrived early and on time, set up was fast and neat, she answered my phone calls when i had to keep my eyes closed, constantly asked if i needed anything, brought music to listen to for the bride to calm her nerves, and made me feel in charge of the whole process while making me look/feel like a princess. I had an updo for my hair and it felt secure, not heavy at all, and i was able to boogy down without fearing my hair would fall down. My make up was flawless! She made sure to always ask questions on each step to see if i liked the color, pigmentation, or anything i wanted more of. This wasnt the first time i got my hair and make up done, but this was the first time i had a stress free session and i had nothing to worry about. All i can say is thank you, thank you, thank you for making my day so special!

ness of her work. She could not have been more sweet and accommodating the weekend of my wedding! I really appreciated her flexibility throughout the weekend. Ella arrived punctually at our Villa at the top of gringo hill for my trial. She was able to do the trial then leave me with a different look for our welcome party. Fortunately, she was not phased at all by the chaos of all of my wedding party arriving to the Villa at the same time. She was extremely generous to go out of her way to let us borrow an air mattress from her when she saw me starting to panic over not having enough bed space. On the day of the wedding, she came to my parents Villa at the top of Villa Amor. She gave me the perfect natural, glowy, and bronzed look I was going for without making me feel like I had a pound of make up on my face. She told me all of her products are tailored to the climate and humidity in Mexico. My hair turned out better than I could have imagined. Above all, what stood out to me the most was that she really went out of her way to calm my nerves and yet hype me up about my special day. By the end of the weekend she felt like a part of the family and I didn’t want to say goodbye! Thank you so much for your hard work and dedication, Ella!

ure I felt like myself on my wedding day. Ella made sure I was able to look in a mirror every step of the way to make sure I was happy with the final look. I was also impressed with how Ella and Anita worked with my mom and the mother of the groom to create hair and makeup looks that they also felt like themselves in! Ella was so responsive and easy to communicate with as well and provided me with a day of schedule weeks in advance which helped with wedding day planning. Finally, Ella and her team were endlessly flexible - a member of my wedding party had to drop out due to Covid and Ella didn’t miss a beat. In fact Ella sent over a new schedule that let us start hair and makeup later which allowed us to take a more relaxed approach to the day. Work with Ella, you won’t regret it!

at would be able to do a more low-key look for the wedding. From the trial at home to my hair and makeup for the wedding events to the way she handled my family, I couldn’t have asked for more. With COVID throwing curveball after curveball during the wedding week I was incredibly anxious, and it was so nice to have Ella there to talk to. She may have been the only person to really calm me down! She’s communicative throughout the process and very intuitive when it comes to one’s style goals. She suggested I do a more fun look for the rehearsal and even incorporated a family heirloom in my hair. I was also in touch with her before the trip about which hair extensions to purchase - and they ended up looking perfect for both my sister and myself. I absolutely loved my wedding day look! She totally understood what I wanted and everything turned out even better than I expected! My friends couldn’t stop complementing the look. Don’t hesitate to book her for your wedding or event! Thank you, Ella, for your patience and your glam artistry. It was so nice of you to stay longer in order to take first-look videos of us at the hotel, too:) I hope we can hang out in the Bay!

I know for me I had a really hard time figuring out how I wanted to do my hair, but she was persistent and tried many ideas until she knew I was sold. On top of that, Ella just cares about you and your bridesmaids as people. She is so sweet, down to earth, and determined to make you feel your best on your big day. I absolutely love Ella and so did my Bridesmaids and my Mom. She really helped make the day extra special and I couldn’t have pictured a better hair and make-up artist for my wedding day. Love her! Highly recommend!

working with a professional who wouldn’t no-show on the big day. For a lack of a better word, I asked Ella to give me a bombshell look and I’ve never felt prettier. She was very patient when I wanted to change my lipstick last minute (she told me lipstick was the hardest decision a bride had to make. I didn’t believe her, but it’s so true!). Ella is also very sweet; I had a great time getting to know her during our almost three hour trial run as well as the morning of the wedding.

She provided excellent guidance and worked hard to ensure that I felt beautiful on the wedding day. She also provided me with a detailed timeline to get hair and/or make up for 8 women in time to take pictures before the ceremony. She and Anita were able to keep to that timeline without rushing anyone's hair and make up. All of us looked so beautiful and the hair and makeup held for all the pictures and ceremony despite it being a super windy day.

did a wonderful job! Fast-forward to my wedding last October 2019. Not only did she and her partner do a wonderful job with hair/makeup for my bridal party and I, she really went above and beyond. I was in a real jam when I found out that I didn't have the boutonniere for my groomsmen. I forgot them at home, which was an hour and half away from the event site. Not only did she comfort me, Ella stepped in and helped make some last minute boutonnieres for the groomsmen by taking flowers out from the bridesmaids' bouquets. She did a wonderful job! I highly recommend Ella for all your special events!

I was so lucky to have Ella as my hair and makeup artist for my big day! I hired her services for myself and my 4 bridesmaids for my wedding at the Berkeley City Club. I was amazed...

that she was able to adorn my bridesmaids with retro hairstyles that fit the venue perfectly. As for the makeup, she has an uncanny ability to bring out everyones best features while still looking natural. I was also very pleased with my bridal hair and makeup. I choose a romantic style - half up, half down with curls. She took her time to make sure it was perfect. My makeup was so pretty - I felt like myself only enhanced. When I looked at myself in the mirror after being styled - I looked incredible! Seriously, I felt beautiful and confident on my wedding day thanks to Ella. My hair and makeup lasted all night and looked great in photos. Ella is a true professional and a ROCKSTAR! Book her if you can :-)

Which was awesome to have that flexibility in the morning of your wedding and not have someone knocking on your door as you are trying to wake up and slightly hung over from your rehearsal dinner. Ella is amazing at her braid work. We went with the boho theme and wanted loose fish tail braids and a side braids and she killed it. Her make up was great to, I have been in weddings where they over due it MAC style and you look at yourself and don’t even recognize the person in the mirror. Our makeup wasn’t to light or heavy with just enough glam. The both were easy talk to and kept it real. I also loved that Ella let me do my trial for my engagement shoot, she even took out the braid for me after she styled me to give me a different look for my engagement photos. I would definitely recommend Ella and her team!

Initially I had asked for very natural make-up because I didn't want to look caked on with make-up, but due to general stress I broke out and I had to ask her to cover it up. She did such a great job, you can't tell in any of the photos. She knows what she is doing! Book her, you will not regret it.

ong hair and I was somewhat more concerned about what his hair would look like than mine. I found a few vendors through The Knot, but had the best feeling about Ella based only on the positive reviews here and her photos. We are not local to the Bay Area so were not able to do a hair trial, but Ella graciously took the time to meet with us face to face. It was so clear from the first meeting that she was the one for us, as she was easy to speak to and was comfortable getting right in and hands on with our hair, which was very assuring. She gave us very helpful tips on what lengths our hair should be for the day, and suggested that I get some hair extensions, since I was worried about how full my hair style would appear. We booked her soon thereafter, and signing the contract and communicating with her along the way was very easy and enjoyable. On the day of, Ella passed by our remote location an hour early to make sure that she was on time and had the right location, but stayed out of our hair until she was supposed to be in it. She brought everything she needed (including a chair!), and got right to work. She was comfortable working in the midst of something like 20 people popping in and out, including crazy parents, children and friends. She did hair for myself, my husband, and our mothers, and was so easy to work with and receptive to our feedback and questions. She also ended up doing light makeup for my mother-in-law. We all looked amazing and she even stayed until my husband and I came back from our pre-ceremony photo session to touch up our hair. My hair stayed in place all night, and I was so happy with how everything turned out! We cannot say enough good things about our time with Ella, and would recommend her to all. I found out that she had been going through a difficult time then, but she still showed up on the dot and gave us her very best. I wish that I had more fabulous functions to go to so that I could have Ella do my hair again! Thank you, Ella!
