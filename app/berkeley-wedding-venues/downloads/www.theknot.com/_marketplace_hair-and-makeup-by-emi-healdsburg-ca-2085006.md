r a look that was natural and made me feel like myself, but elevated, and she completely delivered! I got so many compliments on how lovely the whole look came out, and I couldn't stop gushing over how gorgeous my mom, stepmom, and bridesmaids looked as well! Each person’s preferences were honored and they were so sweet to us. Emi was also so communicative leading up to the wedding weekend, and I had a wonderful time doing my hair and make-up trial with her. On the day of, she was such a calming support during the most stressful period of the day, including delivering my vows to me at the venue when I forgot them at the getting ready location!! Emi and her team were incredible, I can’t recommend them enough!

If I could give Emi Navas more than 5 stars, I absolutely would. I found Emi by Googling hair and makeup artists in my area and then checking out Instagram and reviews. From the mo...

ment I saw her work, I knew she was incredibly talented. What truly sealed the deal was how professional, warm, and down to earth she was when we met over Zoom. She instantly put me at ease, answered all my questions, and made the entire process feel exciting instead of overwhelming. From the very beginning, Emi went above and beyond. I received a full hair and makeup preview, on site services at my home on wedding day, and she even came to my venue to touch up my hair and makeup before and after the ceremony. That level of care and attention was incredible. During my preview, she took the time to really listen to my vision of soft Hollywood glam with red lips. She made thoughtful suggestions without ever making me feel pressured. She recommended extensions, color matched them perfectly, and styled everything beautifully. She even included lashes and application. I asked for Hollywood waves, one of the most challenging bridal styles to perfect, and instead of hesitating, she was genuinely excited to bring my vision to life. What stood out most was how comfortable she made me feel. Emi does not just do your hair and makeup. She takes care of you. She asked about my life, my fiancé Landon, my boys, and shared about herself too. By the end of our first appointment, I felt like I was sitting with a friend. She is kind, real, warm, and incredibly easy to talk to. Conversation flowed effortlessly, and even moments of quiet felt completely natural. On wedding day, she was punctual, organized, calm, and in the best mood. She handled everything with such grace, even when it started raining. She calmly told me exactly what to do to protect my hair, fixed me up perfectly once we arrived at the venue, and stayed by my side to make sure I looked flawless for photos and the ceremony. And when I say she went above and beyond, I truly mean it. She helped me into my dress, helped with my jewelry, adjusted my sticky bra without hesitation, and even offered to help me in the restroom if I needed it. She was my glam artist, emotional support, and personal cheerleader all in one. She even offered to drive me to the venue if I needed it. I truly felt cared for in every way. The final result was breathtaking. Emi did not just make me look beautiful. She transformed me into the most beautiful version of myself. My hair and makeup lasted all day and night through rain, photos, dancing, and lots of happy tears. She also gave me detailed instructions on how to remove my lashes and take down my hair at the end of the night, and everything worked perfectly. Knowing Emi was part of my wedding day gave me an overwhelming sense of relief. Feeling confident and gorgeous was so important to me, and she made that happen in a way that exceeded every expectation. What makes Emi different is not just her incredible talent. It is how she makes you feel. She is calming, encouraging, grounded, and genuinely invested in her brides. Imagine having someone cold or rushed doing your hair and makeup on your wedding day. It would ruin the experience. With Emi, it was the exact opposite. She made the entire process joyful and stress free. I would hire her again in a heartbeat, and I plan to use her for future events. Emi is truly something special, and any bride would be lucky to have her.

s well as worked with my mom and a close family friend, and was incredibly accommodating and flexible throughout the process. All services were done at her salon, but Emi was also very open to being on-site at the venue or hotel if needed, which made planning easy and stress-free. Her professionalism, talent, and calm presence truly stood out. Everyone was thrilled with the results. My mom even said that if she lived in the area, she would hire Emi full time to take care of all her beauty needs—that says it all. Emi was an absolute pleasure to work with, and her work made our day even more special. I don’t plan on getting married again, but I highly recommend Emi to anyone looking for exceptional hair and makeup services.

e everything so easy and I really loved my hair and makeup. She had really good suggestions and she also colored my hair so that it would look perfect on my wedding day and now I still see her regularly for coloring! I also slept in my hair and makeup and was able to wear it the next day to a family dinner and it looked great still after wearing it for my whole wedding day, night, and the next day! I also loved her all in pricing it really made it easier for organizing with everyone getting hair and makeup and took the stress off of me when budgeting and thinking about tipping

us feel weighed down from all of the product, yet still produced hair and makeup designs that lasted through all of the inevitable tears, toasty warm weather, and the whole night on the dance floor! She brought a second artist to help take care of all of the bridesmaids, our moms, and myself so we didn’t have to start crazy early. She adjusted the timeline as needed to accommodate a few hiccups in the schedule, and even found time to help my groom style his hair for the day! I absolutely would hire her again for any hair or makeup needs.

One of my favorite parts was that Emi stayed through the ceremony so we could do a quick hairstyle change before the reception—a sleek “party ponytail” that was perfect for dancing the night away. Her talent, professionalism, and kindness made the entire experience seamless. I couldn’t recommend Emi enough to future brides!

Emi is the absolute best! I was apprehensive to even get a makeup artist because most of what I'd seen was too heavy for my liking and I was worried about not looking like myself....

Emi has forever changed that for me. I was looking for someone who specializes in natural make up and she came up, since working with her for our trial I have been recommending to her to any friends who want the same thing. She was so kind, understanding and really took the time to understand what look I was after and how she could achieve that for me. She helped me navigate new things like eye lash & hair extensions. She even did a re-trial when we didn't have enough time to finish my makeup due to a dress alteration appointment I had made. She was so gracious and understanding about my concerns and immediately made changes until I was over the moon! On the day of, she was such a positive energy and made my girls feels special and pampered. She adjusted things until I was so happy and confident. I cannot express how much joy and happiness she gave me upon my now husbands reaction! It was perfect. My mom never wears makeup and Emi was so patient and helped her have the best time - her and my MIL came to the wedding beaming and expressing how Emi was so helpful and made them feel pretty. MUA really play a big role in your day - she came to the venue to make sure my hair and makeup were perfect before I walked down - and I just feel like I had the best one!!

I think it’s so important to take that into consideration because so many times people don’t and are not satisfied. I was blown away by my hair and makeup when I looked in the mirror. I started tearing up because I felt so beautiful and was so thankful for Emi. Emi made my hair and makeup dreams come true! I felt so beautiful and confident all day long. I can’t thank emi enough! All the girls were so satisfied with their hair and makeup and received serval compliments.

I am so glad I found Emi for my wedding! She is such a kind and talented person. We started things off with a consultation & trial where she truly listened to my ideas, offered her...

thoughts and did the full hair and makeup look. Talked through slight tweaks and adjustments and took photos along the way. I wanted a somewhat non-traditional hairstyle and she really to get it exactly where we hoped. I highly recommend people book a pre-trial with Emi, which helped work through any concerns or hesitations. Leading up to the wedding she had great communication, checking in frequently to make sure my vision still lined up. Day of she was on time and completely professional, not to mention so NICE, it felt like having a friend there with us, not some stranger. She did my hair & makeup as well as family and flower girls. She took the time to listen to each and everyone of them and tailored their look to them, not just a cookie cutter typical approach. My hair and makeup remained flawless all day, even while standing on a ocean side cliff and dancing all night. I highly recommend Emi!
