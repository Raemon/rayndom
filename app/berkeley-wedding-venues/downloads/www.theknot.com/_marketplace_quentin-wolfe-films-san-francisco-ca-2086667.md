"No reviews? That's suspicious." Makes sense, but I promise I'm real & legit! When I first started wedding videography, almost all of my couples came via word of mouth, so I never had a need for being on the knot. However, now in a new location, I decided to come on. Operating out of San Francisco, CA, Quentin Wolfe Films specializes in capturing timeless stories and candid emotions. You have put so much effort into making these moments perfect. Now, let me capture them for you so you can relive the beauty again and again. I began filmmaking by creating videos for my friends and family on vacation. It quickly became a passion, inspiring me to start my own business. With a focus on storytelling, I capture authentic moments and emotions. I look forward to working with couples with engaging stories to tell, from proposals to the big day.

Hey there! I'm here to capture your stories and tell them in a way you will cherish forever. I know how important it is to remember moments as they were, and that is why I put in the effort to get the real emotions of every moment on camera. Your memories should be impactful and everlasting, and I want to ensure that they are. I’m currently living in San Francisco, and am excited to work with people who have engaging stories to tell. Whether it’s a wedding day, a branding idea, or you just have something you want to show the world, don’t hesitate to reach out. Talk soon!

Really nice guy! The highlight video turned out beautifully, and we got the fomo edit as well (full unedited footage of ceremony, speeches, dances) which was very worth it :)
