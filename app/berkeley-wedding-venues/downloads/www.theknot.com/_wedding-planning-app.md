Hallei & Andrew

Iowa City, IA

âEverything you could ever want in a wedding planning tool and more! Helped me find vendors and a venue! Great tools for to-do lists, budgeting, timelines and even a messaging system to message vendors directly.â

Courtney & Daniel

Estes Park, CO

âThis app is amazing! It makes wedding planning so much easier. It helps you keep track of when things should be done. It tells you what things you might be missing. It also lets you make your own wedding site, helps you get your registry, your guest list, RSVP. This app/site is a life saver!â

Kristin & Allen

Antigo, WI

âI am living by this app! It was extremely helpful with finding and contacting vendors. Its timeline is thorough and you can add/delete/customize your to-dos (and their dates). The guest list and tracking has also taken a lot of work out of tracking RSVPs and the reminders for RSVPs are very helpful.â
