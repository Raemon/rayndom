We had Sally Tomatoes cater our wedding with a plated dinner service, and they absolutely delivered. The service was seamless and professional — everything ran smoothly, and their ...

staff made sure our guests were well taken care of throughout the night. Our guests are still raving about the food! From the main dishes to the appetizers and dessert, everything was fresh, flavorful, and beautifully presented. If we had one tiny regret, it’s that we didn’t get a chance to enjoy more of the appetizers ourselves — and we missed out on the tiramisu, which we know from our tasting was incredible! Overall, Sally Tomatoes exceeded our expectations, and we would highly recommend them to anyone looking for delicious food and top-tier service for their big day. -Marc & Meredith Turenne

We went with Sally Tomatoes because we trusted our venue who recommended them and when we went to our tasting, we were blown away. This Italian family absolutely crushed it. Our fo...

od during the tasting and especially for the wedding was INCREDIBLE. We felt so lucky that it all unfolded the way it did. Also, great portions! For some reason, I was worried before we found a vendor that we wouldn't have enough food but everyone had a plentiful amount of food and raved about it. Would definitely recommend them!
