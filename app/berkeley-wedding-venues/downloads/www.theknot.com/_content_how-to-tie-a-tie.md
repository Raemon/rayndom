If you Google search something along the lines of "how to tie a basic tie" or "how to tie a tie easy," chances are you'll find lots of tie tutorials breaking down the Windsor knot. Featuring a polished triangular shape, this simple tie knot style is a classic option for job interviews, presentations and social occasions. Because of its wide appearance, this knot looks best with a spread-collar shirt. Although it might look complicated upon first glance, it should only take a few practice tries to get the hang of this easy way to tie a tie.

### Full Windsor Knot Steps

1\. To begin tying the full Windsor knot, raise your shirt collar and drape the tie around your neck so the wide end is on the right side and extends about 12 inches below the narrow end.

2\. Cross the wide end of the tie over the narrow end.

3\. Pull the wide end up through the opening at the neck, then down.

4\. Pass the wide end underneath and to the right of the narrow end, with the wrong side facing out.

5\. Cross the wide end over and to the left of the narrow end, with the correct side facing out.

6\. Pull the wide end up through the opening at the neck.

7\. When bringing it down, pass it through the loop at the front.

8\. Holding the dangling parts with one hand, slide the knot carefully up toward your collar with the other hand until snug, then lower your collar.

## How to Tie a Half Windsor Knot

![How to tie a half windsor knot](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/46e3f534-94d4-4865-b1b8-0ba30fed1c06~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.2000.1500)

_Design: Tiana Crispino for The Knot_

Understanding how to put on a tie will give you a wealth of options to choose from when getting ready. The half Windsor knot offers a triangular and symmetrical shape for a classic presentation. Because it's smaller than the full Windsor, it works best with wider, medium-weight ties and pairs well with any dress shirt.

As with the full Windsor knot, begin the process by raising the shirt collar. Drape the tie around the neck so the wide end is on the right and extends roughly 12 inches below the narrow end.

### Half Windsor Knot Steps

1\. Cross the wide part over the narrow part.

2\. Cross the wide part behind the narrow part so the wrong side is facing out.

3\. Bring the wide end up and over to the left.

4\. Pull it through the opening at the neck so it lays the wrong side out to the right.

5\. Bring the wide end over the narrow part from right to left with the correct side facing up.

6\. Bring the wide end up through the neck loop again.

7\. When bringing it down, insert it through the loop at the front of the collar.

8\. Adjust the knot by sliding it upward with one hand and holding the tails with the other.

9\. Lower the shirt collar to complete the look.

## How to Tie a Four-in-Hand Knot

![How to tie a four-in-hand knot](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/6bf2d617-9919-4493-b5f0-85a7fb154647~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.2000.1500)

_Design: Tiana Crispino for The Knot_

The four-in-hand knot works well for wide neckties in heavy fabrics. Learn how to knot a tie in this style if you're hoping to dress up a traditional look. It looks best worn with a standard button-down dress shirt. With a few easy steps, you can tie the four-in-hand knot in a matter of minutes.

### Four-in-Hand Knot Steps

1\. To complete this knot, raise the shirt collar and drape the tie around the neck so the wide end is on the right side and extends roughly 12 inches below the narrow end.

2\. Bring the wide part of the tie across the narrow part.

3\. Then bring the wide part under the narrow part.

4\. Bring the wide side back over the top of the narrow part.

5\. Bring the wide side up through the large loop at the neck.

6\. With a loose hold on the knot, insert the wide end in a downward direction through the loop in front.

7\. Holding the bottom narrow part of the tie with one hand, slide the knot upward with the other until neat and snug. Lower the shirt collar to complete the look.

## How to Tie a Trinity Knot

![How to tie a trinity knot](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/9053ee43-5b2b-4bcd-ba89-f10a507c38b5~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.2000.1500)

_Design: Tiana Crispino for The Knot_

As you get more comfortable with the basics of how to tie a tie, you can graduate to more sophisticated options. The trinity knot offers a stylish look patterned after the Trinity symbol. With a more complex design than the Windsor and four-in-hand knots, tying the trinity knot is a little more complicated, but it makes a great statement at formal functions.

### Trinity Knot Steps

1\. To tie the trinity knot, raise the shirt collar and drape the tie around the neck with the wide edge hanging on the right side, just above the navel.

2\. Just below the collar, pinch the wide side of the tie long ways to form a dimple in the fabric.

3\. Take the thin part and cross it over the thick part.

4\. Bring the thin end up through the neck opening.

5\. Bring it back down toward the right side.

6\. Cross it under the thick part of the tie and to the other side, wrong side up.

## FAQ About How to Tie a Tie

How do you tie a tie for the fanciest of occasions? Do certain dress shirts work best with certain tie knots? We're answering all that and more in the FAQ below.

### Do I have to wear a tie to a wedding?

Whether or not you wear a tie to a wedding largely comes down to the [dress code](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-guest-attire-cheat-sheet). More formal occasions like black-tie and semi-formal tend to require some sort of tie to go with your wedding day 'fit. For more relaxed dress codes, like dressy casual, you may not be required to wear one. When in doubt, wear one—you can always take it off.

### Are certain tie knots more formal than others?

Yes; generally, the more intricate the knot, the more formal it comes across. An Eldredge tie should be reserved for [black-tie](https://www.theknot.com/content/what-to-wear-black-tie) and black-tie-optional weddings, for example. Similarly, a knot like the half Windsor is a bit more casual—save that for cocktail attire and semi-formal weddings.

### Does your dress shirt determine the type of tie you should wear?

The short answer: Yes. As with all things in suiting, proportion is key. Thicker, wider knots should be worn with wider shirt collars. Smaller, thinner knots should be worn with slimmer shirt collars.

Whether for business or social occasions, certain ensembles look better with a tie. It brings a level of professionalism and elegance to a suit, vest, or shirt and slacks and adds a level of sophistication to almost any [wedding guest outfit](https://www.theknot.com/content/mens-wedding-guest-outfit). Although clip-on ties may seem like the easiest route, hand-tied straight ties are the most attractive option. Knowing how to tie a tie can open up a number of new styles and looks. With seven of the best tie knots to choose from, there's something for every neck size and shirt style. If you prefer an easy knot, we suggest starting with the full Windsor. Our how to tie a tie videos and simple instructions allow men and women to sport a polished tie in minutes. Practice tying knots in front of a mirror for best results.
