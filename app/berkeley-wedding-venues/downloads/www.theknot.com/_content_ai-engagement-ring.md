# How Does an AI Engagement Ring Generator Work—and Should I Use One?

AI platforms are great for gathering ring inspiration, but less so for structural design.

 _Portions of this article were created with the help of generative AI._

Wedding planning in 2025 looks a lot different from what it did 10 years ago. Now, AI has become an integral tool for inspiration and execution—and it comes into play long before the wedding begins: Many couples are using ChatGPT and other platforms as an AI engagement ring generator.

[READ MORE How to Design a Custom Engagement Ring  ](https://www.theknot.com/content/custom-engagement-ring-design-101)

"Over the past year, an increasing number of couples have shown us AI-generated concept renderings," says Ben Luna, the creative director and founder of Philadelphia's [Workshop Underground Fine Jewelry](https://www.workshopunderground.com/). "There has definitely been a shift from relying mostly on Pinterest boards to experimenting with AI generators to explore creativity, with the goal of creating something truly unique that doesn't necessarily 'exist' yet in real life."

[READ MORE How to Design a Custom Engagement Ring  ](https://www.theknot.com/content/custom-engagement-ring-design-101)

There are pros and cons to this, of course—and the technology is far from taking over. "In our experience, AI can suggest designs that are not viable to manufacture," Luna says. "For instance, AI could design bands that are too thin to support the setting, or create intricate open galleries that aren't practical for daily wear." Couples can get inspired, but should still turn to a jeweler to execute a more true-to-life rendering. "Rely on your jeweler to make sure the ring is engineered to last a lifetime."

To learn more, we tested it out. For this story, I used ChatGPT, Perplexity and Gemini, giving each prompts to help visualize a design, try on styles, compare and contrast and more. ChatGPT took the longest (especially when it came to image generation) and gave me the least helpful responses; Perplexity was almost _too_ thorough. I found Gemini to be the sweet spot for AI engagement ring design, but suggest playing around with different tools. (In my research, it became easy to see how you might use AI for other wedding elements too, such as [writing your wedding vows with AI](https://www.theknot.com/content/ai-wedding-vows) and more!)

**In this article:**

  * Can You Use AI to Design Your Engagement Ring?
  * How to Use AI as an Engagement Ring Generator
  * Prompts to Consider When Using AI to Design an Engagement Ring



## Can You Use AI to Design Your Engagement Ring? 

Yes and no. While you can certainly use AI to get _inspired_ and curate a general aesthetic for your engagement ring, the technology doesn't yet take into account structural specifications—so it's unlikely you'll be able to design the _exact_ ring. "Couples can use AI platforms for ideation to create rough design concepts," Luna says. "These platforms can help articulate your particular aesthetic as a starting point, but cannot create the actual final design. After narrowing it down to a few stylistic themes, you can present those ideas to your jeweler, who can refine the design into realistic specifications that can be manufactured."

Note that some jewelers ([Brilliant Earth](https://www.brilliantearth.com/engagement-rings/start-with-a-diamond/?sid=19424930&dc=), [Richter Phillips](https://designer.richterphillips.com/) and [Milestones Fine Jewelry](https://milestonesfinejewelry.com/custom-ring-builder/), to name a few) offer digital design platforms on their websites, where shoppers can choose a setting, diamond shape, [engagement ring metal](https://www.theknot.com/content/engagement-ring-metal-types) and more to piece together their dream ring. While it's not as specific as a completely [custom engagement ring](https://www.theknot.com/content/custom-engagement-ring-design-101), the tools are helpful for gathering inspiration. 

## How to Use AI as an Engagement Ring Generator 

As Luna notes, an AI engagement ring designer is better for inspiration than exact details. It's also great for information gathering and learning more about the styles and settings used to create a [unique engagement ring](https://www.theknot.com/content/unique-engagement-ring-ideas). Here are some helpful ways to engage AI. 

### Try on Different Styles 

Trying rings on IRL is an important part of the engagement ring shopping process; the feel and fit are paramount when it comes to everyday wear. But to visualize what a ring will _look_ like on, you can turn to AI and narrow down what you might want to try on in-store. For example, curious what a two-carat ring might look like on your hand? Wondering if a marquise stone will elongate your fingers? Try uploading a picture of your hand and telling Chat what you'd like to see on it. (Note that, at least with the free version of Chat GPT, image creation takes quite a while—sometimes a full minute or more.) 

### Take a Closer Look at Design Elements

**"** AI can quickly help you explore nontraditional styles and help you visualize different design details very quickly," Luna says. I asked Gemini what a basket setting looked like and got an up-close image of that particular part of the ring. Traditional engagement ring research can turn up loads of technical terms; AI can help break them down.

### Input Inspiration Images 

AI can take elements from different rings and show you what they might look like together. For example, I uploaded photos of a bezel-set engagement ring and a traditional three-stone ring and asked AI to combine the two into a ring for me. Remember that the resulting AI engagement ring isn't always a technically feasible structure, but it will give you a general idea of how elements might work together. 

### Design a Ring From Scratch 

You can give AI prompts to design a ring—"show me an art-deco-inspired rose gold engagement ring with an oval center stone," for example—but take it with a grain of salt; be inspired by its general aesthetic rather than its structural intricacies. "AI cannot (at least for now) understand the wearability or construction limitations of a jewelry design," Luna says. "You definitely need the help of a jewelry professional to understand whether or not your design is not only comfortable to wear, but also created for longevity. After all, fine jewelry should be able to become future heirlooms and be passed down for generations."

### Compare & Contrast

Aside from imagery, AI offers a wealth of knowledge about stones, shapes, designs and more—and is able to break down complex ideas.**"** Couples could use tools like ChatGPT to explain why certain designs feel more balanced than others," Luna says. "As an example, ask: 'Compare a bezel-set elongated oval to a double claw-prong round brilliant diamond, describing the pros and cons in both aesthetic proportions and wearability.'" The more specific the question, usually, the more specific the answer. "AI can help clarify the reasoning behind your preferences, so by the time you meet your jeweler, you're already halfway to the perfect design."

## Prompts to Consider When Using AI to Design an Engagement Ring

I put AI to the test, considering the points above. I asked it to create AI-generated engagement rings, compare and contrast elements, help me pick a style and even show me rings on my hand. Alter the prompts below to your preferences and get inspired. 

### Style Discovery 

**Prompt:** Luna suggests asking AI platforms to break down different styles you're interested in and see how they best fit with your personal style. He prompted Perplexity: "Describe the differences between vintage Edwardian and art nouveau engagement ring styles, and suggest styles that suit someone who prefers clean lines, but also likes romantic nature-inspired details."

**AI response:** The response was ultra-detailed, filled with charts, imagery and links. Here's the summary of recommendations Perplexity made at the end: 

For someone who prefers clean lines but also loves romantic, nature-inspired details, consider:

  * Edwardian-inspired modern rings that use platinum or white gold with subtle botanical engravings or geometric layouts—the structure keeps lines clean while floral motifs add soft romance.
  * Refined art nouveau reinterpretations that simplify the flowing vine or petal outlines into minimal sculptural settings, perhaps using ethically sourced colored gemstones with light metal frameworks.
  * Contemporary nature-inspired designs (like those from Valley Rose or designers blending twig or leaf motifs into modern solitaires) that merge geometry with organic texture for an elegant, natural look.​



In essence, art nouveau brings whimsical, hand-shaped nature to life, while Edwardian design embodies ethereal refinement—making a simplified modern hybrid of the two ideal for your taste.

### Aesthetic Design

**Prompt:** "Design a unique antique-inspired engagement ring in rose gold with an oval-shaped diamond." Gemini, in particular, is all about creating AI imagery, so you can use this platform to create an inspiration ring. The more specific, the better; and if it doesn't quite nail it on the first try, give modifications. 

**AI Response:** Gemini served me up a pretty photorealistic ring that fit the bill. After my original prompt, I asked for a more toned-down version; when I asked it to remove the milgrain detail, however, things got a little messy and far less realistic looking. 

![Gemini prompt to design engagement ring](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/1819c7eb-9038-4f53-9656-5448e68f746f~rs_768.h)

### Lifestyle Fit

**Prompt:** Tell AI a little bit about your daily routine or lifestyle to see what type of ring it might suggest. For example, "What are some engagement ring styles that work best for a healthcare professional who routinely puts gloves on and takes them off?" Or, "I'm usually dressed down (jeans and a T-shirt is my go-to) and I work with my hands on a daily basis (washing them a lot and wearing gloves). Based on that, what style of engagement ring should I look for?"

**AI Response:** Gemini had some great advice, with this as its summary recommendation: "For your active, hands-on lifestyle and casual, dressed-down style, the most practical and popular choice is a: low-profile bezel-set round solitaire in platinum or 14k gold. This combination offers the best protection, comfort, and security for everyday wear, all while still providing a beautiful, modern and sophisticated look that matches your casual style."

### Virtual Try-On

**Prompt:** "Hi Chat, here is a picture of my hand. Can you show me what a two-carat marquise-shaped diamond engagement ring would look like on it?" I posed this question to ChatGPT. 

**AI Response:** Granted, it took a couple of minutes to generate the image, but Chat served up a pretty realistic visualization—or at least one good enough to give me an idea what my preferred stone shape would look like on my finger. (In my opinion, the ring it showed me seems quite a bit larger than two carats, but that may be splitting hairs.)

### Style Analysis

**Prompt:** Often, you'll fall in love with some parts of a ring but want to change others. AI can help with that. I uploaded an image and asked Perplexity: "I love this ring, but I want it to look a little more modern. Can you analyze the elements and tell me what to change to modernize it?"

**AI Response:** Perplexity started with an analysis of the original style, then offered up some recommendations: 

To modernize this design, consider these updates:

  * Replace the yellow gold with platinum or white gold: These cool-toned metals enhance a contemporary feel and give the ring a crisper, sleeker appearance.
  * Reduce the bezel thickness: A thinner, more open bezel or even a minimal prong setting makes the center stone appear larger and more modern.
  * Floating or open gallery: Adding negative space beneath or beside the stones (openwork or floating settings) makes the design airy and fresh.
  * Play with asymmetry: Shifting one or both triangular diamonds so they don't mirror perfectly adds a modern, artistic twist without sacrificing elegance.
  * Soft curves or mixed shapes: Instead of rigid geometry, try curved bands or one triangular and one round accent stone to break up symmetry in a subtle way.
