Mona Amanat

Founder & Floral Designer

Hi, I’m Mona Amanat, the heart behind Mona Floral Design. My love for flowers began in my childhood. I was inspired by my mother’s resilience and creativity during challenging times. I vividly remember saving my pennies to surprise her with a tuberose bouquet. That moment sparked my lifelong appreciation for the emotional power of flowers. Watching her turn simple materials into works of art taught me that beauty can bloom even in the hardest of circumstances. Floral design, for me, is about connection. It’s about bringing together stories, cultures, and emotions through the language of flowers. Every arrangement I create reflects the individuality and vision of my clients, celebrating life’s most meaningful moments. Based in Contra Costa County, I proudly serve the greater San Francisco Bay Area and Napa Valley. I travel wherever my clients need me. I look forward to helping you transform your vision into unforgettable memories through thoughtful and personalized floral artistry.

We loved working with Mona from MonaFloralDesign for our wedding. Not only is she a joy to be around, but her work is incredible. From the very beginning, she took the time to list...

en to our vision and made thoughtful suggestions to bring it to life. Not only did she deliver exactly what we wanted, but she somehow made it even better than we could have imagined. She did all of our floral arrangements including the bridal bouquet, boutonnieres, centerpieces, arch, sprays and aisle markers. The flowers transformed the venue and made it come to life and our guests couldn’t stop complimenting the flowers! Mona’s creativity, professionalism, and passion for her craft truly shine through in her work. Would definitely recommend her for any event.
