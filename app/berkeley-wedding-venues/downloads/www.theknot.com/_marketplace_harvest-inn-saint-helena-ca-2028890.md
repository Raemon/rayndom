We got married at Harvest Inn on 10-25-24 with a group of 30 of our closest family and friends and it could not have been more perfect! Harvest Inn was a dream. Our guests were b...

lown away by the beauty of the place, and people said it was the best wedding food they ever had. Everything was perfect. My only note to destination brides looking at Napa is to be aware of harvest time; it's their busiest season (for good reason, it's beautiful). Communication may be slower as all vendors tackle the overwhelming volume of items on their plate, but these guys are pros - they handled everything perfectly. Also, the rooms and the hotel itself is amazing. They are large, beautiful rooms. And, the location is perfect. We can't wait to go back and stay again.

As a wedding planner I absolutely love working with the Harvest Inn team for a million reasons. Their staff is absolutely wonderful from the events manager to the banquet staff. Th...

e food is incredible. I always feel like I'm in good hands and don't have to stress about making sure all the important details and communication will be handled smoothly. The venue is gorgeous, between the vineyard views and the redwood trees, the proximity to town (yet it's set back and quiet), it's like walking into a vineyard fairytale. I highly recommend the Harvest Inn for so many reasons and it's absolutely one of my favorite places to be when helping my clients with their memorable celebrations!

5 Stars for the property and views. We were really excited for this venue and had heard great feedback but unfortunately this was not the case for us. Food was above average but no...

t great. Service was really disappointing during our cocktail reception (only served red wine vs white) and dinner where there was a long lag before the main entree came and we had to ask for servers to pour wine. Maybe it was because our wedding was on a Sunday and staff was tired? Nobody from the Harvest Inn checked in with me nor did they follow-up on how they did. I do not write a lot of reviews but I was disappointed. Did I mention the mouse in our room and the cigarette butts on the pathway that got stuck in my wedding gown? We honestly felt like they did not need our business or care.

My husband and I want to give a 5 star review for the Harvest Inn as our wedding venue. It is a gorgeous venue. The staff at the Harvest Inn were exceptionally thoughtful and dil...

igent in their planning / logistics, while being super responsive to our many questions. They removed the stress of planning our wedding. Additionally, I want to call out Mimi and Claudia in their help in planning the wedding. They made things so easy from Day 1 and were so helpful throughout the wedding weekend. In searching for a wedding venue, the Harvest Inn provided excellent value. Weddings are expensive and many vendors charge a premium, but the Harvest Inn provided a fair price for services delivered. Moreover, our guests thought the food provided was best wedding food they have ever had! The Harvest Inn completely exceeded our expectations.

We had our wedding in December of 2022 at Harvest Inn. When we first stepped into the property to check it out, we instantly fell in love with the picturesque and storybook like ch...

arm the venue had. Then we walked towards the vineyard and fell in love with the rustic vineyard view. We instantly knew that this would be the venue for our wedding. The Harvest Inn staff were extremely helpful, approachable and accommodating. They truly made the planning process easy for us, which put as at ease throughout the planning process leading up to our big day! What made it extra convenient for us is also having lodging on-site, which made it easy for us and our guests to easily walk into the ceremony and reception from the guest rooms. We did not have to worry about shuttles or transportation, but Harvest Inn did provide a private shuttle to venues nearby, which we utilized for our wedding rehearsal dinner at a restaurant about a mile away from Harvest Inn. We, and our guests, truly enjoyed our experience at Harvest Inn, and created such beautiful memories in such a rustic charming venue. We highly recommend this wedding venue.

The redwoods, the vineyards, the ivy, the brick and stone!.... The Harvest Inn is a beautiful wedding venue. They offer full use of any/all of their spaces, including a rose garden...

, large shaded lawn, terrace overlooking the vineyards, and indoor space. Mimi, Brenna, and the Harvest Inn staff were accommodating and kind throughout the entire process, and were very mindful of all the little details. Food is catered through the hotel restaurant, The Harvest Table, and was absolutely delicious. Guests raved about the stunning property and the delicious food. Only limitation is that outdoor amplified music is not allowed past 9pm, but this can be easily planned for my moving the DJ/band into the available indoor space located directly off the terrace. Would highly recommend if you're looking for a quintessential Napa Valley location that is beautiful before you put a single decoration on the property with delicious food and lovely staff.
