Besides, you can't help but groove to its irresistible beat, offering guests the chance to truly let loose and embrace the celebratory vibes.

Plus, the celebration party song will add a much-needed burst of energy after dinner service.

## 17\. "Hey Ya!," Outkast

Everyone, from your grandparents to your teenage cousin, knows and loves this Earth, Wind & Fire hit, so much so that it's practically synonymous with celebrations. The grand horn instrumentals, fast-paced beat and infectious chorus have all withstood the test of time.
