From the first minute being welcomed by Fernanda at the door till walking out two hours later (again with the lovely Fernanda), this was a completely wonderful dining experience. We started off with a drink with Chase at the bar before dinner ...

who was very funny and with whom we share a love of Barolos. At dinner with the professional and fun server, Emma, and the ever helpful, Luis, we had the Tagliatelle and Gem Salad for starters and the Fried Chicken and Pork Chop with a side of Snow Peas for mains. All were terrific. The fried chicken is the best we have ever had including in Korea, anywhere in the South and at Thomas Keller's. Fabulous. All of it was great but the real treat of the evening was Will the sommelier. He is so knowledgeable and enthusiastic about his craft that a wine lover like myself could have spent hours talking to him. It really made our dinner special. Great food, great ambiance and a terrific crew make for a wonderful dining experience.

Stopped by for happy hour at 4pm. The drinks and apps we got were very tasty. By the time we left at 515 the place was busy!

Food was all really well cooked and the vibes of the restaurant were really nice. The wait staff was super friendly. Really enjoyed the fries and dip but everything tasted delicious, fresh, and interesting.

OMG--Prospect still SLAPS with the same DELICIOUS and AMAZING flavors as ever! I'm here for the popular Prospect burger and fries this time. Amazing! Service is top-notch and keeps getting better. If Jerry, your server, buckle up--you're i...

n for a next-level dining experience! Plates come out looking like works of art--bright, colorful, and full of love. And the taste? Even better than the presentation. Every bite is a wow-moment. The wine list is selective, special, and impossible to mess up. Pick anything, and you'll be golden. The vibe is romantic, classy, yet super fun--exactly the kind of atmosphere that makes you want to linger all night. I seriously LOVE everything about this place. Parking, though... that's the only adventure. Between the rideshare chaos and tight spaces, finding a spot--especially with a big car--is tricky. Pro tip: get here early before dinner hours, and with some patience, you'll find one. And trust me--it's 100% worth it once you're inside.

It’s a nice place that seems to be trying to come across as sophisticated and innovative. However, some of their culinary choices didn’t quite work for me—for example, hazelnuts in a pork chop dish just felt a bit out of place. The tartare was ...

pretty spicy, and the portion was very small, definitely not enough to share. I also wish they offered a kids’ menu, as that would make the restaurant more family-friendly. The atmosphere itself is pleasant, and the presentation of the dishes is attractive, but overall the food didn’t fully live up to the expectations set by the concept. With a few adjustments, this place could be much more enjoyable.
