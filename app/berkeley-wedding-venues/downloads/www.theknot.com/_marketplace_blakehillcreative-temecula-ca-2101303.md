With BlakeChillCreative, your videos will focus on crafting romantic, cinematic wedding films that feel personal, intentional, and timeless. Rather than simply documenting the day, I approach each wedding as a story; capturing the quiet moments, genuine emotion, and meaningful details that matter most. Weddings go by fast, but the way it felt deserves to last. BlakeChillCreative is a wedding videography company based in Temecula, CA.

I'm passionate about storytelling, and love to make memories look and sound how they truly felt. I enjoy creating thoughtful, custom built sound design and movie trailer quality music; your wedding song specially remastered to tell your story. I am skilled in advanced color grading and retouching, so even if the lighting or conditions aren't perfect in the moment, I will ensure you look incredible and well lit in the edit. I am empathetic and a hopeless romantic, who often feels very connected to the memories and emotions captured on your special day. It's my passion and honor to create a gorgeous memory for you to enjoy rewatching and it's my hope that you'll find yourselves cuddling on the couch, reliving these moments, and falling in love with one another all over again.
