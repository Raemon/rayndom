This was a great hotel for playing tourist in San Francisco. The location made it easy to take transit everywhere we wanted to go. The heated pool was a hit with the 9yo even in November. We'd stay here again for sure.

Maria at the front desk was amazing! She was super friendly and went above and beyond to ensure I had a great stay. She provided a complimentary upgrade to a room with a Bay view and worked with me to ensure my big truck had a parking space. Th...

e parking assist was huge! It’s nearly impossible to find a hotel that can accommodate a truck or SUV. Maria really did a standout job! I was exhausted on arrival and her kind manner and assistance made all the difference. I’ll definitely keep this hotel on my SF travel list as a must-stay. The location is great and within walking distance of the wharf and excellent restaurants and cafes.

We had a wonderful stay at Hotel Caza! The location is fantastic — close to Fisherman’s Wharf, shops, and restaurants, which made exploring San Francisco really easy. The rooms were clean, comfortable, and well designed, and the atmosphere thro...

ughout the hotel felt relaxed and welcoming. The staff were friendly and always happy to help with recommendations or directions. We especially appreciated the fun touches like the games area and complimentary coffee in the lobby. Overall, a great place to stay for families or anyone wanting to enjoy the best of San Francisco. Highly recommend!

Pro: Good surroundings with nice restaurants and quite clean. City centre easily reachable by bus or cable car. Cleaning service did a good job. Cons: Very noisy rooms, you hear everything from the street and also from the rooms next door. I ha...

d to sleep with earplugs. They also charged me 200 USD too much for the room and I had to go talk the front desk 6 times until the issue was resolved - very unprofessional. Rooms have no amenities like free bottled water, kettle, coffee machine, etc

In their booking confirmation email/reservation it says it charges us in full when you book. "Full payment due at time of booking" I guess that did not happen and they requested full payment when we physically checked in, this whole time I thou...

ght they charged me in full already because that's what their email said.... Email only included "daily room rate" but not the total or the extra fees. We paid extra for a "city view" that had example photos of Coit tower.... It feels VERY misleading as we do not have a view of Coit Tower but paid extra for it. No complimentary breakfast when we are paying $45 EXTRA a night on top of the daily room rates The "milk and cookies" option they said we would get between 8pm-9pm was animal crackers... Very noisy area around the hotel and thin walls where we could hear so much noise from sidewalk/street. It's 1:37am currently and the nightclub next door has been keeping me awake. If you are a light sleeper stay away from this location! Front desk staff and bartender have been fine, nothing exceptional nothing bad. Ice machine broken on floor 3 Check out was at 12pm, but our key cards stopped working before 12pm Body soap was never filled in our bathroom we arrived on Friday and Saturday it was empty and they never filled it we checked out on Monday It's more so the Caza company that needs to update on their terms/email on when they are taking payments and update their city view photos on their website so it's not so deceiving when you pay extra for a city view of Coit Tower
