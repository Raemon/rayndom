axed instead of stressful. They really paid attention to what we wanted and made sure we felt comfortable and confident the entire time. Our hair and makeup turned out beautiful, and they were so thoughtful with all the little details. It honestly felt like they cared just as much as we did about how everything looked. If you’re looking for a team that’s talented, organized, and just genuinely great to be around, I would definitely recommend Ritual Salon. They helped make our wedding day feel really special.

g, the communication was effortless and organized. Natalie, the bridal coordinator, was phenomenal. She handled every detail with so much care and clarity, and she made the entire planning process feel calm and seamless. On the wedding day, the artists were incredible. They arrived fully prepared, created the exact look I imagined, and somehow made it even better. My hair and makeup lasted through photos, wind, fog, happy tears, and hours of celebrating. Every member of the team was kind, talented, and truly invested in making me feel beautiful. I cannot recommend Ritual Salon enough. If you are getting married in San Francisco or anywhere in the Bay Area and want a team that delivers luxury, professionalism, and artistry, this is the place. My experience was perfect from start to finish.
