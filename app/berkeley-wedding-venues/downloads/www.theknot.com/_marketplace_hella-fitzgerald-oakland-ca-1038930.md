A musician's dream! Per the recommendation of our wedding planner, we worked with Hella Fitzgerald for our wedding in Big Sur, CA in August 2023. One of the best decisions we made...

for our wedding. I am a musician myself and had a lot of specifications for what I wanted throughout our ceremony, first dance, and dancing portions of the evening. And I mean a LOT of specifications! Music is something I am very particular about. Lilan worked closely with me on everything from which 2nd singer to hire to match the feel we wanted (the band works with various singers) to learning new songs that we had requested to adjusting songs to specific BPMs!!! She never seemed to lose her patience with me and would text me randomly with ideas or singer leads. One time she even texted me a couple vocal riffs she sang into her phone to see what I would prefer. We wanted a fun, sexy, big band feel and a talented group of musicians who could perform soul, Latin, swing, R&B, and everything in between. That is exactly what we got. Thank you HF!

Hearing those songs, which she arranged for the band, really warmed our hearts—thank you! Look, hiring live music, especially a large band like this, is not inexpensive. There are cheaper options out there. But if you want something extra, something people will remember, this is it. It was so worth it.

ng was rather small (<100 attendees) music was such a big priority for us, we wanted to create a lounge like atmosphere with a trio. Lilan was clear and communicative about the bands needs, she made sure to provide options within our budget which was a huge plus. The performance the day of our wedding was like out of a dream. Lilan's voice was absolutely stunning and I can't imagine our wedding reception any other way. We chose "Sunday Kind of Love" for our song and it was just so deeply moving so many attendees went out of their way to compliment us on the band. I gladly recommend Hella Fitzgerald!

3-piece jazz ensemble (vocals, grand piano, upright bass) to play after the reception. They sounded amazing and perfectly set the tone for a relaxed jazz club like scene where my wife and I could mingle and actually enjoy the company of our guests. Lilan has an amazing voice and was also wonderful to work with leading up to the event. She made the entire process seamless and put together a perfect repertoire for our intimate soiree. The entire band was a pleasure to work with from start to finish, and I appreciated their professionalism and attention to detail. All in all, I couldn't have been happier with Hella Fitzgerald's performance at my wedding. They truly made the night unforgettable and created a fantastic atmosphere that we'll never forget. I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a talented and charismatic jazz band for their next event.

The musicians in the audience had their jaws on the floor listening to the amazing skills on stage, and everyone else was just dancing their butts off to the awesome funk, soul, pop, and rock. Our wedding was outside and it was really cold, but Hella Fitzgerald handled it with no problem, and everyone on the dance floor was shedding their layers as they heated up from dancing!

Hella Fitzgerald was fantastic. Lilan and the band got everyone on the floor and moving all night! In addition to the main band, at our cocktail hour we also had Honor Brass Band (...

Hella Fitzgerald's New Orleans brass band with many of the same members). Between the two groups, they played so many different styles of music - jazz, funk, pop, everything in between - and did a great job reading the room to keep the energy high. Aside from that, Lilan and the team were amazing to work with. SUPER professional and organized (but like, in a fun way), and came with a lot of great ideas based on their experience of what was going to work best. They were also really open and accommodating about the ideas and requests we had. Anyway, everyone should hire this band. They are the best. Thanks Hella Fitzgerald!

Hella Fitzgerald played for our wedding August 2019 - and they were AMAZING!!! They were easy to work with during the planning process, and were great performers on the day of the...

show. Detailed review: 1) The Music - This is an incredible group of musicians! We hired a group of 9 musicians (2 singers, horns, sax, guitar, base, drums, keyboards). Several of our guests were musicians themselves and they were impressed by the bands' talent. - The singers (Lilan in particular) are so talented! Soulful, engaging and always in tune - it was a serious treat to get to listen and dance to them! The set list was also perfect. They had a great list of songs, and were respectful of our "do not play list". They played a great combination of funk, soul, pop - providing a unique/memorable all super fun dance party. Our guests kept commenting on how good the band was! 2) MC Skills - Lilan MC'd our reception events (intros, speeches, cake cutting, first dances, etc) and she was professional, succinct, and articulate. We were proud to have her guide the events and keep things running smoothly. 3) Professionalism & Communication- Working w/ Hella Fitzgerald was an easy process. They had a straight forward contract, and were happy to answer questions and work with our venue coordinator as needed. They went above and beyond to meet the venue requirements, which we sincerely appreciated! Overall - from easy-going personalities, to a fun set list, to great musicianship - this band is amazing! They are cool / timeless all at the same time and we 110% would book them again. Thank you to Lilan and her team for making our wedding so memorable!

The dance floor was one of the most important parts of our wedding and we knew we wanted a live band to really bring the energy. This band is legit. They are all extremely talented...

musicians, and all our guests loved it. We got so many compliments on the band, still a couple months later. My biggest advice to couples when working with them is to not try to micro manage. We probably tended towards the type A planning couple, and in retrospect this was unnecessary stress we were putting on ourselves. Communication isn’t always that speedy, but I think they hired a dedicated person so it’s improved. And generally, they know what they’re doing, so just give them some direction and they can craft a set list from there that will keep people on their feet all night. Would work with them again in a heartbeat.

Hire great & talented people and they will make your life easy on the one day when you really shouldn't have to worry about anything. Thank you Lilan and Hella Fitzgerald and Daniel and Honor Brass Band.

tured a trio while the reception featured a full band. The music they played was nothing short of amazing! Cocktail hour set the mood with some light jazz; the reception set built up the energy wonderfully culminating with songs that energized my guests on the dance floor. Best of all, they were highly accommodating when structuring the full package. Would highly recommend!

What an amazing and talented ensemble! We recently had the pleasure of having Hella Fitzgerald play at our wedding (5.12.18), and we are so incredibly happy that we did. Our band...

was led by Natalie and Tasche, who were both incredible musicians with loads of energy, enthusiasm, and charisma. All of our guests RAVED about the band. They definitely set the perfect tone throughout the event: for the ceremony Tasche played lovely and well timed renditions of two classical pieces I requested, the cocktail hour and dinner featured a selection of their jazz, swing and blues cannon, and the reception was brought to life with their incredible soul, funk and contemporary selection. I requested they learn a new song for our first dance, and their rendition was so far and above the source material I had sent them. Both Natalie and Tasche have such beautiful and powerful voices, and with each song I was blown away. Their range was so fluid and impressive! Lilan, the band leader, was the epitome of class and professionalism in her communications with me, and her correspondence was always prompt. She checked in with me multiple times before the event, and her planning shone through in the effortless flow that characterized the event. I made a few last minute requests for the break music, and she graciously accommodated them. If you are considering a live band for your event or wedding, do yourself a favor go check them out live at one of their many regular engagements! We were already wedded (haha) to having some live music for the ceremony and cocktail hour, and their prices were extremely competitive compared to those of a short engagement band and typical DJ. Our reception was made SO SO SO much better with their live music and energy. Any wedding DJ can play the same top 40 hits for your reception, but none can compare to the enthusiasm, musical talent, and pure JOY that you will experience with Hella Fitzgerald at the helm.
