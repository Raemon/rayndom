Joanna was a pleasure to work with when shopping for my wedding gown. She has been doing this for a long time, so I had full confidence in her abilities as a dress consultant but a...

lso as the seamstress. It was nice to know the different ways she could alter the gowns when I was trying on different dresses since she was the one who would actually be doing all of the alterations. My dress turned out to fit me perfectly and looked great. Joanna is truly amazing!

Joanna did my wedding dress alterations. She was always timely and never pressured me to spend more than my budget. In 2 sessions she had my dress altered perfectly and ordered me ...

jewelry and a veil. I was ready for my wedding easily within my 3 month timeline. I'm even using her shop to dry clean and preserve my wedding dress and I know it's in expert hands. Thanks Joanna!

Joanna had already fitted 3 of my friends' wedding dresses, so I knew right away I was in good hands. She was incredibly patient and responsive to my changing weight as we neared ...

the wedding day. My dress had many many layers of lace and tulle, and while this made the alterations challenging, Joanna made it all look seamless and perfect for the big day. I highly recommend Joanna for your wedding dress alterations!

d with, so I spent considerable time researching options near San Ramon online and decided to take it to Joanna's Bridal. Her shop is filled with stunning, beautiful gowns and jewelry (I found some earrings that matched my gown perfectly!) For my gown, she hemmed the bottom of it a bit, took out a layer of the tulle for me and shortened my straps. Everyone on her team was very helpful and responsive, and her rates were very reasonable. She did such an impeccable job -- I have a bridesmaid dress for a wedding next month that I'll be bringing to her also. I would strongly recommend Joanna to anyone in the Tri-Valley area looking for a wedding gown or needing tailoring for a formal event.

Joanna is an extraordinarily talented seamstress, and I have her to thank entirely for my exceptionally beautiful wedding dress! I first visited Joanna’s bridal salon in September...

last year on the recommendation of close family friends. Within a mere thirty minutes, she helped me find “the dress!” Although I had shopped around several boutiques, including the posh, upscale bridal shops of the Bay Area, Joanna’s selection and pricing was top of the line. Joanna constructed a gorgeous sash for the back of my dress, truly turning it into my dream gown. But my perfect experience with Joanna didn’t end there. For the cocktail hour at our wedding, I hoped to wear my mother-in-law’s wedding dress. However, my beautiful mother-in-law is so slim, I simply couldn’t even zip up her gown! I took the dress to Joanna hoping for a miracle, and magically, she expanded the 30-year old bodice to seamlessly fit my ribcage. We were all floored!! I commend Joanna for her remarkable talent and incredible professionalism. To all the brides in the Bay Area, please check out her inventory. For those brides who have already found the perfect dress, put your trust in Joanna’s capable hands for the alterations. This woman is talented beyond belief and will truly make your bridal vision a reality!

e 2nd dress I tried on. While I was there, she was able to accomodate my bridesmaids and I while I shopped. She asked good questions and made good suggestions for helping decide. Once I chose the dress, she was also great with the tailoring process. She is very talented and has a good eye to make you look and feel beautiful in your dress. She has a good price range from inexpensive to higher end dresses so she is able to accomodate everyone. I highly recommend Joanna's Bridal for any brides looking for a calm, easy process.

icked out flattering dresses to my petite body type. We had them do the alterations also, and they came out perfect. I ordered my dress in May 2013 and received it in February 2014, which turned out perfect for my July destination wedding. At one of my fittings we even found a reception dress to wear. I love both the dresses and their prices are very reasonable.

Joanna's is a small business tucked away in a nondescript strip mall, not exactly the first place you go to try on wedding dresses. Despite its lackluster location, it's a great li...

ttle salon with ZERO pretentiousness. I went to a number of such salons in San Francisco and other cities, great dresses, but couldn't find the ONE. Low and behold, on a random Thursday afternoon, I went in with my mom and found it! The Maggie Sottero I bought needed some changes and Joanna was awesome at making those changes. She is a very accomplished seamstress. She took off a ton of (tacky) beaded appliqué and added a beautiful beaded belt. It looked perfect, you would not know it wasn't made like that! In addition to my dress, my mom found her dress there by fluke. Again, Joanna altered it, adding straps and making a beautiful shrug. Joanna's is not fancy and run only by Joanna and her husband, so you just have to roll with it. I did not experience ANY of the negative things written in other reviews, my experience with Joanna was always great. She's a incredibly friendly person and I really enjoyed my time with her. It was personal and every time I was the only one in the salon, which was really nice.

As a local resident of Danville, CA, I knew Joanna's would be my first stop. My mom, thankfully, ran by the day before we were planning on stopping in and made an appointment. We w...

alked in the next day and immediately I felt like I was the most important person in the world. Joanna was so attentive to what kind of style I thought I wanted. Even though the shop seems small, she has more variety and style. Joanna is the only one who handles the dresses, so each dress looked as good as new and I could really picture exactly what my dress would look like. She also pays attention to your reaction when a dress is pulled off the rack. That is how she gauges which order you try your dresses on in. The first dress I put on was it! I tried on several others, but nothing compared to the first one. My mom and I were hesitant to even look at the price tag, but when we did, we were so relieved. It was totally reasonable! As a seamstress herself, my mom can recognize quality craftsmanship and immediately was impressed with the detail with the dress. Not only did I find my perfect dress, but Joanna made the whole experience a dream come true! I am planning on bringing my bridesmaids in to look at their dresses too, since she has an incredible collection. Joanna also does all of the alterations herself which I love! I could not have asked for a better experience and highly recommend a stop at Joanna's!

Joanna's is a small boutique that is very professional. I went to a few other places before landing at Joanna's and when I found my dress, I knew it was the one. Because Joanna's...

is small and is run by her and her husband you do need to make an appt. but they are very attentive as you get closer to your big day! I ended up going somewhere else for the bridesmaids dresses just because the selection was bigger somewhere else, but for my dress it was worth it! I also got some beautiful jewelry there from a women who makes her own jewelry and is there in the store on weekends. Truly unique!

I tried on 20-30 dresses. Some for fun, but I did have a hard time finding the right one. I went to Joanna's because they carried a large selection of the line I liked. For a small...

er boutique they had a lot of selection. The other thing I liked was that I felt like I got a lot of individual attention versus some the national chain bridal stores. Joanna and her assistant really listened to me about what I liked and didn't like about what I was trying on. I ended up choosing one of the first dresses I tried on there. As far as pricing goes, it was pretty fair. I went to other boutiques and the higher prices at other places didn't necessarily equal better quality.

I was so pleased to find Joanna's Bridal right near my hometown. The selection of dresses was very impressive, and the quality of the samples is so high that I bought the dress rig...

I have been waiting until AFTER our wedding to write anything about this experience because I was worried it would get worse... now that the wedding is said &amp; done I can finall...

y talk about how HORRIBLE my experience here was. It all began when I went in for my first dress fitting, and Joanna, the owner, ordered my dress in the wrong size and then insisted that she did not order the wrong size and literally said "You gain weight, not wrong size". Now while I may be a cury bride... with the wedding coming I had been on a strict diet and exercise regimine and had actually LOST weight since I ordered the dress. There was not enough time to order a new dress so I worked my booty of, literally and lost 20lbs just to fit into my dress. To make matters worse, after I fit into the dress and went back in for what was supposed to be my final fitting... she hadn't done ANY of the alterations. There were literally pins still sticking in my dress from my fitting like 8 weeks before. I wanted to cry. Then, on my final fitting day... she told me to not gain weight or it will be tight and look bad. Who says that to a bride two weeks before their wedding!?!? This place is horrible and I would NEVER, EVER reccommend it to any bride.

I have had a couple of experiences with Joanna, and they have been wonderful! I just bought my dress there (a three thousand dollar dress that I got off-the-rack for $600!!!), and ...

my brother's now-wife got her dress there as well. The alterations on her dress were truly stunning. I can't wait to get mine altered for my wedding! Joanna is extremely nice. Overall, I definitely recommend this shop!

t was very excited about everything and that made it fun. When we went back for the purchase, JoAnna was in a very big hurry to get us in and out. Our bridesmaids dresses were two weeks later than she promised and there was no explaination why. My dress was 3 months later than she promised and she blammed it on UPS when it seemed as though she forgot to order it. She was not apologetic at all. Her dresses are reasonably priced, but her accessories are over-priced.
