Our wedding photography and videography team was absolutely amazing. Luke and Eric, our photographers, were so friendly, flexible, and helpful throughout the entire day. They made ...

us feel comfortable in front of the camera and captured every special moment beautifully. Mauro and Ramone, our videographers, were equally wonderful to work with and went above and beyond to get the perfect shots without ever feeling intrusive. The entire team worked seamlessly together, and their professionalism and talent made our day even more enjoyable. We cannot wait to see all the memories they captured.

Our wedding venue recommended A Perfect Impression, and we are so happy we went with them as the photographer for our wedding day. The online photography questionnaire is very thor...

ough and gives plenty of space for you to share exactly what your photography wants/hopes are for the day while also sharing logistical information for different parts of the day. Natalie, who also did our engagement photos, is amazing. We were so happy with our engagement photos that we requested to have Natalie as one of our wedding photographers. We also worked with Hayden on our wedding day. Natalie and Hayden both did an incredible job of making us feel at ease and checking in with us often throughout the day. We highly recommend A Perfect Impression if you are looking for a Bay Area wedding photographer!

My husband and I don’t love having our photos taken and we were definitely nervous for our wedding day with all of the attention and having to take so many pictures, but from the b...

eginning Aaron put us at ease. After months of planning all the details from cake flavors to tablecloths for our big day, what we were ultimately left with were memories and photographs. Aaron was able to take photos that told our story and captured the emotion of each moment. Seeing our photos was like reliving our day over and over again through those moments he captured. We have timeless memories of our wedding thanks to API and these aren’t just any photographs either, these are the ones that will hang above our fireplace for years to come. We are so grateful to the team at API for understanding the importance that photos play in your life and would recommend them to everyone!

Andy was our photographer he did an amazing job! He was thoughtful and really made taking pictures a lot of fun. There was a moment where I almost passed out due to not being used ...

to a corset dress and he took the time to make sure I was okay. We got our pictures right away which was amazing since they usually take two months. The pictures are gorgeous! We haven't received our video yet but I'm sure it's amazing as well. My only little complaint is that they don't make it very clear that you have to pay for the rights to your pictures it's listed in the contract at the very bottom but never discussed. The upside is they are always running sales so the price can drop and in the end it's worth the extra amount because the pictures are just fantastic! I can't wait to see the video.

I was really happy that API was a connected vendor with Wedgewood! I like that they had a detailed checklist with picture preferences to make the process easier. Andy was great to ...

work with as our wedding photographer. The guests were entertained by him. Pictures turned out beautiful. Vanessa was very responsive with our photo albums. I'm glad they were a part of my wedding day.

I could not have been happier with API! We got married at a Wedgewood location in the Bay Area and went with API because our coordinator highly recommended them. We got married...

in a church and then had our reception at Wedgewood, which left about a three hour gap in between. Our photographers, David and Aaron, were wonderful and worked with us to make sure our large gap time was put to full use. They were both friendly and highly professional. I can't wait to see the photos in a few weeks! Vanessa in the front office is also amazing! She took the time to meet with me about two months before the wedding to go over the timeline and desired photos. I'd recommend API to anyone! :)

We had a referral to Perfect Impression and they sent one of their photographers out to our wedding in Texas. I could not be happier with their services! Our photos are absolutely ...

stunning (if you are doing an outdoor wedding, they do an amazing job)! Our photographer was friendly, personable, and worked really hard for us! It was pouring down rain while we were trying to do our bridal party photos. Our photographer took and umbrella, a trash bag and climbed a latter in the middle of the downpour to get some great shots! They also got our photos back to us just a month after our event. I highly recommend A Perfect Impression!

Our photographers not only had wonderful ideas for shots; but they ven helped keep us running on time in our pre wedding photos! They were thorough and helpful in the pre-wedding ...

meetings. We made a thank you sign to take pictures with and send with our thank you cards. Our main photographer allowed us to look at the pictures on her camera the night of the wedding and choose the picture we wanted. She then promised to process the picture and have it to us within the week so that we could get started on our cards. No surprise to us, she came through! Wonderful!
