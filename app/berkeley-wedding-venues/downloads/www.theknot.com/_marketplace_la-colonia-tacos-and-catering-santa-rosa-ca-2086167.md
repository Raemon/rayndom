SO glad we went with La Colonia for our wedding. Our wedding was on a fairly remote ranch, and Victor and his team did everything imaginable to make it as easy and worry free for u...

s. Worried about rain and last minute shifts in logistics? Victor offered to come up the day before to assess the situation and get things in ahead of time as needed. Last minute additions to the menu or late night snacks? Shoot an email to Victor, and he says "good idea - here's how I'd suggest we do it, and I can handle all of it!". On the day, Victor was a confident, smiling, reassuring presence amongst the inevitable chaos of other late-morning preparations, the food (and churros and hot chocolate!) were exceptional, and the bartenders were super friendly, going along with the many strange requests from us and our guests. Overall, an incredible team to have partnered with, and who played a HUGE role in making our wedding the dream it was. Thank you Victor, Coral, and all the team!

guests raved about the food and how attentive they were during appetizers and dinner. The meatballs and chicken parmesan were particularly mentioned a lot. We can't wait to try their tacos in the future.

n. They'll work with you to create the right menu for your event and can do a wide range of dishes. Victor was also really helpful in the lead up to the event, coming to the venue with us to get a lay of the land, helping us figure out the right floor plan for the buffet to serve guests quickly, and even helping us find bartending staff as well. He can also help source tableware and flatware. We're so grateful for Victor and the entire team and we'll be returning to the taco truck in Santa Rosa for lunches and dinners in the future!

La Colonia Mexican Food Truck, owned and operated by Victor Roldan, is a hidden gem in the world of street food. Victor's dedication to quality is evident in every aspect of his bu...

siness, from the meticulously clean environment in which the food is prepared to the exceptional ingredients he carefully selects. The ingredients used at La Colonia are always fresh and of the highest quality, which translates into vibrant, flavorful dishes that stand out from the typical offerings of food trucks. You can taste the difference in every bite. What truly sets La Colonia apart, however, are the special dishes that Victor creates. His menu features classic Mexican fare, but it's his unique twists and the extra effort he puts into each dish that make them unforgettable. Victor's passion for his craft shines through in every dish he serves, making La Colonia not just a meal, but an experience worth seeking out. If you’re looking for authentic, delicious, and thoughtfully prepared Mexican food, La Colonia is a must-visit.
