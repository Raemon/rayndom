A Japanese wedding dress is more than just a garment. It represents centuries of tradition, symbolism and artisan craftsmanship. For Japanese brides, and those hosting multicultural celebrations, saying "I do" in traditional Japanese wedding attire offers a deeply personal way to connect with their culture and family history. It's also an important part of [Japanese wedding tradition](https://www.theknot.com/content/japanese-wedding-traditions), in which brides change into different symbolic garments for each part of the ceremony. To learn all about Japanese wedding dresses, I spoke with Ayuka Matsumoto, luxury bridal curator, stylist and editor of [EDIT FOR JAM](https://www.editforjam.com/), and Chika Murano, creative director of [DRESSMORE](https://dressmore.co.jp/), Japan's leading wedding dress company. Keep scrolling to learn more, and discover where you can buy a Japanese wedding dress near you. And as always, if any photos catch your eye, you can tap the heart in the top right corner to [favorite them](https://www.theknot.com/your-favorites/inspiration) and add them to your wedding vision board.

## What Is a Traditional Japanese Wedding Dress?

So, what do Japanese brides wear? A Japanese wedding dress is called a kimono. It's a T-shaped robe that wraps around the body and is secured at the waist with a sash. Kimonos typically have a rectangular silhouette with wide sleeves and a crossover V-neckline. Although they can be made from a variety of different fabrics, the kimonos that are designed to be worn in weddings are traditionally made from silk.

There are many different types of kimonos, each holding a distinct meaning. Some are reserved for the groom and wedding guests, while others are for the bride during different wedding ceremonies. According to Murano, the bride may change kimonos once or even twice throughout the event. 

What color do Japanese brides wear? Well, that depends on the event too. Brides traditionally wear a white kimono at the start of the ceremony, then change into a red, orange, gold or multicolored one during the reception. (Pro tip: Guests shouldn't [wear red to a wedding](https://www.theknot.com/content/can-you-wear-red-to-a-wedding) of a Japanese couple, since there's a chance the bride might be wearing it.) Of course, as traditions continue to evolve, we're seeing more modern Japanese wedding dresses in pastels, jewel tones, and even metallics.

## Parts of a Japanese Bridal Outfit

The kimono isn't the only part of a Japanese wedding dress. In fact, there are a number of different pieces that come together to form the entire bridal ensemble. Below are a few of the main pieces to know.

### Shiromuku

The shiromuku kimono is an all-white ensemble worn by Japanese brides during their wedding. The name "shiromuku" means "pure white clothing," and the garment itself represents the bride's purity and new beginnings as the bride prepares to take on the colors of her new family. According to Matsumoto, "the shiromuku is considered the most formal and sacred garment, and is typically worn in Shinto ceremonies."

### Iro-uchikake

"The iro-uchikake is a richly embroidered outer robe often worn at the wedding reception," Matsumoto explains. "It's typically decorated with auspicious colors such as red and gold and motifs like cranes or cherry blossoms that represent longevity and happiness." Brides will typically layer the iro-uchikake over the shiromuku after all formal ceremonies have completed.

### Obi Sash

The obi sash, or obi belt, is a decorative belt that wraps around the waist of the bride to secure the kimono in place. They don't have any buttons to keep them fastened. Instead, they are tied into a bow or knot (which can be either at the back or front, depending on the bride's preference). 

![Bride wearing Obi Sash](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/3bf4de08-6193-4d41-b8ad-51032b6d0cd6~rs_768.h-cr_120.0.1080.720)

### Accessories

"With traditional bridal kimono, brides often carry a set of five items, which may include a decorative pouch, a small dagger, a folding fan, and cords used to fasten the kimono and obi," says Murano. "These accessories are carefully color-coordinated to add elegance and vibrancy to the outfit. For hairstyles, the traditional choice is a Japanese-style wig called nihongami, but many brides today prefer Western-style hair with a white hood called a wataboshi (which is essentially the Japanese equivalent of a wedding veil) or floral headpieces as modern alternatives," she explains.

## Modern Japanese Wedding Gown Tips for Brides

Japanese brides, or brides planning a multicultural celebration, are by no means required to wear a kimono on their big day. Contemporary wedding practices invite nearlyweds to embrace cultural attire in a way that feels natural and authentic to them. That might mean wearing a kimono during the ceremony, then changing into a Western wedding dress for the reception. That also might mean foregoing a kimono altogether. According to Matsumoto, "many brides in Japan choose Western-style wedding dresses rather than traditional kimono."

Of course, if you do decide to wear a kimono, there are plenty of modern ways to do so. For instance, you could wear a style of kimono called a hikifurisode. According to Matsumoto, this is a long-sleeved kimono with an extended train that was once reserved for unmarried women in Japanese culture. "Today, some brides choose it as a symbolic final appearance in this style before marriage," she explains.

## Where to Shop for Japanese Wedding Dresses

When shopping for a Japanese wedding kimono, brides can choose to either rent or buy their garment. According to Matsumoto, "about 90% of wedding attire in Japan is rented rather than purchased." However, purchasing a wedding kimono is always an option, especially for those who wish to pass it down to a loved one after wearing it. Below are a few of our favorite places to rent and buy Japanese bridal attire here in the United States.

  * **Japanese wedding dress designers:** Working one-on-one with a Japanese wedding dress designer allows you to have a deeply personalized dress shopping experience.
