icularly impressed with the on-site accommodations, which were great for bringing together close friends and family for our wedding weekend. Everyone loved the scenic grounds and beautiful barn, which are brilliantly set up for wedding usage. One note: don't be afraid about their stated capacity, if you have a smaller event! While Stemple Creek *can* accommodate 100+ guests, our group of 55 still felt right at home, without feeling like we were drowning in the space.

ited. The ranch did not disappoint on the day of our wedding either. The trees stood tall, the fall flowers were in bloom, and the sky was painted with beautiful colors amongst the golden rolling hills. Additionally, the site managers, Lauren and Katie, are also the best humans. We are so grateful for them. They were flexible and supportive throughout the whole wedding process. They also added so much joy to the day of our wedding as well. Stemple Creek Ranch will always hold a special place in our hearts because our favorite day was there. We can’t wait to come back to visit one day.

Stemple Creek is the most perfect place to get married. The location is stunning, there are so many spots for the ceremony, cocktail hour and barn for reception. We actually visite...

d the site in the rain the first time and it was STILL gorgeous! Plus they have onsite houses to get ready in. Katie and Lauren were always there to answer questions. I got SO many remarks about how unique and special of a location Stemple Creek was. I can't wait to see the photos. One thing I didn't realize as an FYI is that if you use their tables & chairs you are responsible for set up and take down, something I wished I had taken care of but all in all still worth it. I would also recommend getting the houses to stay on location so you can continue to use them during the event. Stemple Creek will always hold a special place in our heart. Hope you make them your next venue!

venue was the most beautiful place I could imagine to get married at. The team at Stemple Creek was so on top of everything, easy to work with, and also very communicative. 10/10 would get married again if I could, and definitely at Stemple Creek!

st beautiful spot they'd ever been to for a wedding. It also needs almost no decoration since it's so gorgeous as is. It's also really customizable as a space - we did our ceremony up in the grove, then happy hour outside the barn and dinner and dancing inside. Highly recommend them for a ceremony/reception spot!

e our families that flew in from all over fall in love with it too. From the super cute and remodeled "Schoolhouse" that the bridal party got ready in to the trees we said I do under and the gorgeous barn we danced in, it was perfect. Working with Alissa, their event manager was also easy as could be, she was super helpful and accommodating with everything we needed and we couldn't be more thankful.

e under the large redwood tree was beautiful. And the barn is the crown jewel of the property. Alissa, who we worked with from Stemple Creek, was also great. She was very helpful throughout the planning process and was also on site on the wedding day. She worked very well with our planner and the other vendors so everything went smoothly on the day. We were inundated with compliments about the venue from all of our guests! Thank you Alissa and Stemple Creek! We are forever grateful!

o many compliments on how beautiful the day was and how the venue was so unique to our guests. Not to mention, Alissa, Loren & Lisa are such a great group to work with! They were extremely flexible, accommodating and responsive through the entire planning process- something that any bride needs and loves! Our wedding was the weekend after the devastating Sonoma/Napa fires, which definitely caused some stress and last minute changes. Loren made us all feel so comfortable and was so considerate with carrying out our original game plan. Alissa is such a rock star and was so helpful with recommendations - and knows this gorgeous venue inside and out. We could not have asked for a better place to get married!
