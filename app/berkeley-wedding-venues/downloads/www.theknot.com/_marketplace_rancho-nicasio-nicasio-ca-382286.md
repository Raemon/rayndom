Thanks to recommendations from couples on The Knot

Rancho Nicasio is a wedding venue located in Nicasio, CA. This rustic destination is situated in the heart of Marin County and is surrounded by rich natural surroundings, including picturesque gardens, woodlands, and distant hills. For couples picturing a party under the stars or a traditional reception, there is plenty to choose from at this charming spot. Originally built in 1941, this historic roadhouse has retained its rural atmosphere while also offering convenience and accessibility. The sleepy village of Nicasio pulses with provincial charm. Rancho Nicasio is seen by locals as its beating heart. A church dating back to 1890, a local store, and a post office complete the town square. These traditional landmarks help maintain the country feel of this quaint region. The ranch itself offers a number of scenic spots that are perfect for photo opportunities. Endless views of the surrounding pastures and fields provide an authentic agricultural backdrop to any occasion. Inside, the influence of ranch-style Western charm can be felt as everything from wagon wheels to an exposed brick fireplace create a welcoming atmosphere. Couples looking to exchange vows in the great outdoors can do so on Rancho Nicasio’s manicured lawns. Newlyweds and 300 guests can enjoy the celebrations under a gazebo adorned with vines, and sip cocktails by the outdoor bar. Banquet-style or round tables line the garden area, laid out to each couple’s liking. For couples seeking a ballroom and outdoor wedding, the Rancho Room can accommodate 160 people. Exposed wooden beams complement the oak dance floor, and refined French doors lead to the deck, brick patio and lawn area. Live entertainment can use the custom-built stage, which is fully-equipped with high-quality sound and lighting. For more intimate receptions or rehearsal celebrations, the Western Room can seat up to 50 guests. Revelers can enjoy a cocktail hour and canapés at the adjoining Western bar and soak up the ambiance of this locally-loved watering-hole. The in-house planner will assist couples in planning their ideal day. The expert team assists in wedding design, and they collaborate with couples to source everything from catering and entertainment to flowers and photographers. As well as offering a number of wedding packages, these experts are happy to customize weddings. A dressing room is available to the wedding party during their stay. There is ample parking available for your convenience, or you may arrange a transfer bus to take attendees to and from the venue.

As a queer mixed-race couple with a very diverse community, we wanted a place for our May 2024 wedding that reflected who we were and that would be comfortable and inviting for eve...

ryone. Our criteria were that it was somewhere beautiful, had delicious food, and wasn’t too far from the East Bay. We visited a few venues around the Bay, but they all felt like copy/paste of whatever pinterest wedding fad was happening at the time. Beautiful, but just not us. I heard about RN and asked a friend from the area if she knew it. Without hesitation she said, “That place is great!” We went to visit in May 2023 to scope it out and meet with Marina, the event coordinator. The backdrop for RN is quintessentially California: tightly nestled in golden rolling hills flanked with redwood forest. The venue itself is funky, rustic, and meticulously cared for. We went through the event space and overviewed the planning process. Before we even left, we knew it was a solid yes. People say planning a wedding is stressful but not when you’re working with Marina. Over the next year we had regular phone calls to go over the spreadsheets she’s created that cover EVERYTHING, and were customized to our vision. We did our own flowers, had friends make cakes, a memorial table, and lots of bespoke table decorations/ signage. The organizational planning we’d done over the previous months made it simple and easy to drop off the items the day before/morning of, and they were set up exactly how we wanted. Picking up the items the day after was just as easy. When the Big Day came, we walked through the gates into our own private and stunning wonderland. The garden teemed with flowers, butterflies, and birds. During the ceremony, a family of quail scuttled behind the arbor. During cocktail hour, servers passed delicate appetizers and fresh drinks to our guests. Dinner was superb. “Buffet” and “salmon” don’t usually go together for me, but the chef is a sorcerer; it was moist and perfectly seasoned. As the evening progressed, the friendly bartenders crafted our specialty cocktails with consistency and finesse. When the fog rolled in, we headed inside to the dancefloor where the nearby tables offered space for non-dancers to still be a part of the party. The entire experience went off without a hitch. The whole experience exceeded my expectations. As for Marina. It’s palpable she genuinely cares about not only the couple, but also the guests, staff, and the West Marin community. Her approach to planning is methodical, focused, empathic, and invested. She went above and beyond to make our wedding special. Marina did her own research and worked with the chef to come up with recipes for foods we wanted to reflect my fiance’s culture but they didn’t offer on the menu– Cuban pork and black beans. We wanted to make sure the venue was wheelchair accessible, and Marina happily sent us measurements and photos of all the door thresholds. Her care reflects in the staff– everyone seemed happy to be there. In all the packing and unpacking of the decorations, nothing was missing or broken. On top of being REALLY good at her job, Marina is a brilliant and funny person. We were happy to have her as a wedding coordinator, and now thrilled to have her as a friend. Tips: Marina offers various table decorations to rent for the event such as votive candles; This will save you time, space in your garage, and money. Also, rent the heat lamps. That fog is cold.

ervous bride heart at ease. Our guests still talk about how amazing their dinner was and how fabulous the service was. Marina worked closely with my husband and I on curating the most beautiful seamless reception. The string bulb lighting glowing over the tables as we ate our dinner in addition to the rustic gazebo which held our cake and the friendly bartenders who served the most delicious cocktails were just a few of the bonuses. I highly recommend considering Rancho Nicasio when you are planning your wedding. Couldn't be more satisfied.

siderate, and an overall pleasure to work with. Her organized planning document and phone calls helped me feel heard and on top of things! She helped my wedding vision come to life! The venue itself is beautiful and it was the perfect space to accommodate 160 guests. The food and drinks were fantastic, and there were many options for every dietary need. Rancho Nicasio's crew and sound tech were all so kind and professional. There is a bridal cottage on site that my bridesmaids and I had access to the morning of the wedding. This made getting ready and seeing the venue come together easy and relaxing. Our wedding day was the best day of my life, and Rancho Nicasio played a huge role in that! I cannot recommend and thank them enough!!

Rancho Nicasio is truly a hidden gem in the heart of Marin County! From the very first visit, I knew this was where I wanted to get married. The venue is absolutely breathtaking — ...

the rustic charm, sweeping views, and peaceful countryside made for the most beautiful backdrop imaginable. Planning the entire wedding was so easy and enjoyable thanks to Marina, who was there every step of the way. She made the process seamless from start to finish — always organized, responsive, and incredibly kind. Every detail came together perfectly, and I never felt stressed once. The bridal cottage was such a wonderful perk — cozy, private, and perfectly set up for getting ready with my bridal party. It made the morning of the wedding feel relaxed and special. And the dinner buffet? Absolutely divine! Every dish was delicious, beautifully presented, and our guests couldn’t stop raving about how scrumptious everything was. It truly felt like a fine-dining experience in the most welcoming, country-chic setting. The whole day was smooth, easy, and full of joy — I couldn’t have dreamed of a more perfect wedding. It was the best day of my life. I also love that I can return to Rancho Nicasio anytime for lunch or dinner and relive those wonderful memories — it’s like stepping back into that magical day every time I visit.

y needs, and offered amazing recommendations for the event. My husband and I wanted something casual with a lot of flair and boy did they deliver. The setting is unreal and offering a shuttle to our guests made things easy and fun. Marina was there to greet us as we arrived and handled every aspect of the day. The actual ceremony was underneath the trees with 125 guests. After cocktail hour, guests were seated at beautifully decorated tables. The food was wonderful and exactly what we asked for. The band (shout out to Mitch Polzac!!) has played there many times and knew exactly what to do. The dance floor was filled all evening. I have never been so relaxed hosting a party. If you are looking for something with character you really need to check out this place. Honestly, it was perfection!

ting. The rental included the use of a large patio and it gave my guests plenty of room to spread out and mingle. There is also plenty of parking! The food was absolutely delicious and was a generous portion size. The real highlight of this venue however is the event coordinator Marina! She treated my small reception with the care and attention of a large event. She had the answer for every question I had and was always very easy to get a hold of. The way Marina and her team decorated the space was even more beautiful than what I had imagined in my head. Just a few weeks before my event I had a family member go through a sudden surgery and when I reached out to Marina about discussing some dietary accommodations she jumped right onto finding the perfect meal for them and truly went out of her way to make sure my guest was taken care of. Her compassion during a difficult time meant the absolute world to me and my family. If you're thinking about booking here do it asap! This place was truly a gem with absolutely incredible people working here!

We hosted our daughter’s wedding ceremony and reception at Rancho Nicasio in late September and could not have been happier with the outcome. From initial contact throughout the p...

lanning and execution of the 150 person event, Marina was a pleasure to work with and made everything effortless. Her guidance and recommendations were very helpful and always aimed at delivering the best possible guest and bridal experience. From coordinating with our band to the minute to minute timing of the day, it all went without any hitches or surprises. Clearly this venue knows what they are doing and does it well. The setting is gorgeous, surrounded by the beautiful Marin countryside and provides an ideal layout for ceremony, dinner, and dancing. While space is abundant it maintains an intimate feeling to ensure guest are comfortable, relaxed and have an enjoyable time. The cottage provided to the bridal part for the entire day was a huge benefit for overall logistics and providing the bride that special time with her closest friends. Last but certainly not least, the food was amazing! Getting a buffet done right for 150 is not easy task, yet the kitchen delivered perfectly cooked salmon and chicken, a beautiful spread of roasted vegetables as well as everything else on the menu that simply exceeded expectations. We were beyond pleased as was our daughter. At the end of the day, giving the bride her dream wedding is what it is all about and with the right excellence of Rancho Nicasio, her dream came true.

My husband and I cannot say enough good things about how amazing RN is! From the moment I went to tour the venue, I couldn't get over how special and picturesque it was, and I was ...

so excited for our guests to experience it with us. The food was phenomenal, and there were so many great options to choose from. Not many venues also include beverages/food cooked on-site, and the fact that RN provides all of that makes for an incredibly seamless experience (and better tasting food)! There's also an amazing cottage on site, which we were able to use as a bridal suite! It's essentially the size of a one-bedroom apartment with plenty of space and natural light for getting ready. It was perfect!! Our guests also raved about the convenience of the location in relation to the church. We chose to have our ceremony in the nearby church, and it was so easy for our guests to go from one location to the other -- really just a short walk! What really sets this place apart from anywhere is Marina -- she is an INCREDIBLE coordinator! She was organized and communicative every step of the way, and she truly made our wedding vision come to life! I knew I was in amazing hands, so that by the time the day actually came, I was really able to be present and felt I could enjoy every second of it rather than running around trying to make sure everything was running properly. I truly believe our day would not have been as perfect as it was if it had been anywhere else. RN is a very special place, and I couldn't recommend it to other couples enough!!!!

y have people telling us it was their favorite wedding they've ever been to. The venue itself is absolutely amazing. It’s a totally gorgeous, rustic, and charming slice of Marin County. It perfectly nailed the vibe we wanted—it’s classy and elegant but still feels super laid-back and fun. We knew the second we saw the space that it was special, and we’ve gotten endless compliments about how unique and cool it was But here’s the real secret weapon: Marina, the event coordinator. She is truly phenomenal. Marina is the reason our slightly chaotic, big-picture wedding ideas actually turned into reality. She’s organized, incredibly fast with responses, and she genuinely cares. She worked with us tirelessly to personalize every single detail, making sure the wedding felt 100% authentic to us, not just some cookie-cutter event. With Marina handling the heavy lifting, we could actually relax and just enjoy being married. The food was fantastic, the staff very attentive, and the whole atmosphere felt like pure magic.

eally appreciate her level of care and hospitality. I wanted to use some of our table runners and chargers, which was not a problem. She arranged for us to drop off the day before a box of items and the cake. They were kept safe and presented eloquently. The presentation was gorgeous. The event was like a dream. We arrived to delicious warm appetizers. One of our guests has a negative response to peppers and heat and hearing this, they made some chicken wings for her sans sauce. They are exceptionally attentive and kind. They even followed up with her as she ordered tacos with salsa - but the salsa was apparently not too hot. This level of attention is not something I would expect. They went well above my expectations. We each ordered from a pre-arranged menu. The soup and salads were perfect as were the entrees. Everyone was delighted with their choice and commented that this was the best food they ever had at a wedding. I ordered the baby-back ribs and could only eat 2 as they had so much meat on them. Each of us took leftovers back to our residences as the portions were quite generous. The cake table was set to look like a magazine shoot. Simple, rustic, gorgeous. They made our vision into a reality. Thank you Rancho Nicasio for adding a page to our love story. (It was so good, we came back 2 evenings later for dinner.) Whenever we are in Marin Co., we stop by. Please don't ever change. We love the hunting trophies, upright piano, western motif, good food and chill vibe.

I grew up in Marin County and now live in Brooklyn, NY. When I got engaged, it was important to me that we had a West Marin wedding as this special part of the state is something w...

e really wanted all of our friends from all over the world to see. The first planner I spoke to told me what I wanted was impossible to pull off. But I’m determined…. My first idea was to have a Welcome Party at Rancho Nicasio for what ended up being 150 people. I had my 8th grade Father Daughter Dance there and its been a special place to me since I was a little girl. From the moment I reached out and started talking to Marina, the events co-ordinator, everything was SEAMLESS. She was so on top of it, helped me plan every detail and stayed in consistent, clear communication. This planning took about one year and had many meticulous details- a roving count of guests, a local band, a little girl’s birthday and provided transportation to name a few. Marina was AMAZING all along, as was Jamie who did the sound for our speeches and the event. A truly TOP NOTCH crew. Then came the actual night- because of other events planned for this Wedding Weekend, I wanted Rancho to not be decorated and just be shown for the beautiful, special and preserved place it is. When we arrived, I was blown away by how beautiful it was- the setting sun, beautiful table settings, lovely bar, such polite and well dressed service. It was far beyond my expectations. The food was amazing, the setting breathtaking and the whole night beyond our wildest dreams. Thank you to Marina and everyone at Rancho Nicasio who made our dreams come true and gave ourselves and our guests a true West Marin night that will remain unmatched and be in everyone’s memories for many years to come. I could not recommend this venue and their staff more, and we will always be back to remember the best weekend of our lives.

Max , Marina and the whole Rancho Nicasio team made the planning process so easy and stress-free, even through multiple COVID cancellations. Their recommendations (makeup, flowers,...

band) were perfect so that we really didn't have to research other vendors - and their food is wonderful so no stress with catering either. Marina's organization was very helpful in the months leading up to the wedding especially since we took a more hands-off approach to planning- she guided us in all the relevant decisions and when they needed to happen so I never felt lost or confused. They helped our guests feel welcome and crafted a casual, fun atmosphere.

Max was great to work with at the beginning as we finalized the contract and the date. He was really approachable, flexible, and we appreciated that he didn't charge a fee for every little aspect of the event like a lot of other venues do. Marina was very helpful and responsive as the venue coordinator during the planning process, and she made sure everything ran smoothly the day of.

Rancho Nicasio was an amazing place to have our wedding. We saw many venues in our search, and as soon as we stepped foot in Rancho, we were sold. It has pretty much THE perfect la...

yout and combination of factors to make for a great party -- there's a grove of trees for the ceremony, an outdoor lawn for cocktails, huge area outdoors for dinner on the lawn, spacious indoor dance floor and stage fully equipped for live music right next to the main lawn, and a huge bridal cottage (actually a small house on the property) that is great for getting ready etc. The way the event flowed from place to place within the venue was easeful and just perfect. Rancho also has an in-house event coordinator/caterer Julii, and she basically took care of everything for us so we didn't have to stress about the small details. I cannot emphasize enough how much of a difference that made - the fact that the venue provides furniture/infrastructure and then Julii and her staff sets everything up for you is worth its weight in gold!! All of those elements and the staff's hard work meant that we could actually enjoy our day with a glass of champagne and not have to ask our friends and family to be setting up chairs and tables all day. Julii also has all kinds of back-up supplies and decor if you need any supplements (table cloths, decor, etc) she will take care of it. One thing I will say is that if you are the type of bride who needs everything to be exactly a certain way and you will freak out if the napkin is one inch to the right instead of left, Rancho might not be for you. That is not to say that they didn't do an amazingly beautiful job, it's more that they have this down to a science and ask you to trust them on a lot of stuff and they don't hand-hold you with details leading up to the event. They definitely came through in a major way and everything was gorgeous, so I'm glad we trusted them. And omg the FOOD - Julii and her team got everything fresh at the farmers market that week and cooked up a bounty of beautiful dishes for our wedding. For cocktail hour we had an oyster bar (!!) and local cheeses and passed hors d'oeuvres, and then the dinner was a huge spread of delicious fresh gourmet dishes. I've had many, many people tell me it was the best food they've ever had at a wedding. Overall, Rancho was fantastic and we're beyond happy that we had our wedding there. Thank you so much to the Rancho Nicasio staff for making our wedding amazing!!

Our friends and family are still raving about the charcuterie table and BBQ oysters, and the buffet spread was unreal. Our guests also really appreciated the late night grilled cheese and french fries. Julii and her team went above and beyond for us, my husband and I are amazed at how smoothly the day went. Julii worked with our DOC to pull off a seamless event. Without them, I truly don't know if we would have been fed - we were sad to miss oysters and cake, only to find that they saved both for us! We had an array of party favors (coasters at the table, bags of popcorn, and custom mugs) and every time we flowed to the next event, the favors moved with them so that guests had every opportunity to remember to grab them. Overall, we were looking for a laid back venue with a rustic vibe, but all of the amenities that make throwing a giant party easier - food and alcohol on site, an event coordinator, an indoor space for dancing and as a backup for inclement weather. What we got was all that and so much more. Julii took care of all the details and allowed us to focus more on the personal touches, and it was so amazing to see our vision carried out so perfectly. We highly recommend Rancho Nicasio, and would get married there again and again if we could!

best' wedding they'd ever been to (thanks in large part, no doubt, to our having chosen Rancho Nicasio as our venue). The beautiful, rustic-chic setting with potential for indoor/outdoor festivities, the DELICIOUS food and the fabulous staff are some of the reasons Rancho Nicasio was the perfect venue for us. Max, the owner, and Julii, the onsite wedding coordinator, were instrumental in executing such a wonderful experience for us and for our guests. They were also responsible for the production of much of the food (I really can't emphasize deliciousness of the food enough -- especially in such large quantities. People RAVED about it)! Julii is an expert (and so fun!) and helped us craft our vision. She accommodated and encouraged us to add special touches to make our wedding as 'us' as we hoped it could be. She and her staff went above and beyond to efficiently execute a last-minute switch-up due to unforeseen weather, which we really appreciated. Julii worked directly with our vendors to ensure everything ran seamlessly. We recently received our photographs from the wedding and were reminded again of how lucky we were to have been able to have Rancho Nicasio as our venue. The beautiful outdoor ceremony among the trees, the picturesque cocktail hour (complete with fabulous oyster bar!) and the cool inside bar and fabulous dance floor are some the visual highlights. We will cherish these memories for the rest of our lives.

proach; how he talked about the food, the day, and the couples before us; it was clear RN knew how to throw a great party with delicious food in a gorgeous setting. What we didnt know was just how great it would be. Family members have said our wedding was the best day of their lives (better than their own!), friends continue to rave about the food (go for the oyster bar!), the rustic and natural beauty of Nicasio, the speeches during sunset, the dancefloor, the staff, everything, and we couldn't have dreamt how wonderful we felt when it all came seamlessly together! Max advised us to reserve one of the few remaining August dates for our wedding, and we're so glad we did. The lighting and weather were perfect, cooling down just enough after a 3 day heatwave. We did end up ordering heat lamps through RN for dinner and the dessert deck, which our guests really appreciated. Julii was a blast to work with - she really knows her way around yummy, local food and how to please a crowd and ensure that the bride and groom are taken care of (that special oyster platter during dinner was icing on the cake!) We also ended up hiring an outside wedding planner about 6 weeks before the big day, which was exceedingly helpful finalizing all the various vendor contracts (shuttles, florals, band, RN sound tech, cake) and ensuring we didnt have to handle vendor communications the weeks leading up to and on the big day. It was also helpful to have the planner take care of delivering gratuities on the day of and orchestrate with Julii behind the scenes, so that we could dance until the last song with no responsibilities other than taking it all in and enjoying being surrounded by our favorite people. Thank you Julii, Max, Steve, and the rest of the RN team for throwing us the best party of our lives!

great dance room and bar to follow. Majority, if not all of our guests and us included, believe it was the best food we have ever had at a wedding. The food was truly remarkable prepared by Julii and staff. The oysters, mini hamburgers and charcuterie board were a huge hit. The salmon, prime rib (Max the owner working the pit), and grilled vegetables were cooked to perfection with amazing sauces. The staff was more than attentive and constantly there to take care of our needs. We were actually shocked how many employees were there checking in on us and our guests. We took photos for part of cocktail hour and were not able to visit the appetizer table but when we sat down for dinner the staff brought us a bit of each appetizer and made sure we were served dinner and drinks. We hired a 6 week planner to help take the burden off us which is not necessarily needed because Julii does an amazing job but she worked great with our planner. We could not have asked for anything more and Rancho Nicasio went above and beyond our expectations.
