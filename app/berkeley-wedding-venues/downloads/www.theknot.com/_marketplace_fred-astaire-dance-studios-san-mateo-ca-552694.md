We worked with Olya to choreograph a first dance for our wedding. Though the studio was very advanced, we were able to come in with minimal couples dance experience and have a gre...

at time for a very reasonable price. Olya was great in both teaching steps of the dance style and putting together sequences that fit into our oddly rhythmic choice of song for our first dance (sorry Olya!). Our only suggestion for those taking the lessons is to practice the sections learned in between sessions, that way you can take the most advantage of Olya's choreography during your time with her. For us, this was less homework and became more a couples' hobby in the months before our wedding. We fully recommend this studio and wedding dance package for anyone who wants to learn more couples dance with their partner and put together a first dance you can be proud of.

When planning our wedding, my husband and I knew that we wanted a choreographed first dance. We came to DanceVita based on reviews and proximity, and they exceeded our expectations...

! We booked the 4-lesson package and within that time, our dance was solid! We worked with Olya who was detailed, thoughtful, kind, and helpful! From our first trial, she intuitively picked up on our strengths and weaknesses and customized a dance for us that we could feel proud of. With her expert teaching and guidance, we mastered a dance to Conversations in the Dark by John Legend and created memories to last a lifetime! They deliver on their promise that within 4 lessons, your dance will be set. Olya also helped us crop the music to fit our dance. She is a pro at answering questions and diagnosing the steps that we were having trouble with. Neither of us being expert dancers but wanting something beyond a step touch, she created a piece with some intricacies that looked beautiful and were manageable. Now we are considering doing some more lessons just as a fun hobby! Without any reservations, I recommend going to Olya (and DanceVita) - from first dances to a new hobby, you will not be disappointed!

We used to go to Dance Vita for Salsa lessons before so already knew their instructors were amazing. Have had a great time learning our wedding dance with Meghan.

Thank you Oksana for teaching us a fun and appropriate dance to show off our new skills. We got four full lessons and one consultation.
