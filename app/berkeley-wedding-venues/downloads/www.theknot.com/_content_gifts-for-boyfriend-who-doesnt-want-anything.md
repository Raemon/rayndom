What gifts do boyfriends want? We think comfortable clothes that are effortlessly stylish will always go over great. Available in six sizes and colors, like blue and gray, we're sure your beau will love this hybrid shirt, since it has the look of a flannel but the feel of a cozy sweater. Bonus: A couple of five-star reviews said that their spouses loved the flannel, which means this is a good [gift for husbands who don't want anything](https://www.theknot.com/content/gifts-for-husbands-who-dont-want-anything) too.

### 21\. Large Body Pillow

We have a lot of ideas for what to get a guy who doesn't want anything, but this one is one of our favorite functional options. This pillow, which comes with a removable cover, can relieve pressure from the neck and back since it contours to the body. You can choose from two different fills, cooling gel and natural latex, to satisfy your boyfriend's need for firmness, durability and more. 

Before you pay for your boyfriend's new body pillow, add an exclusive code from us. **Use code:****KNOT15 to get 15% off sitewide.**

### 22\. Custom Bartender Bottle Opener

Cool gifts for your BF aren't tough to find if he's trying to level up his home bar. We love this wood bottle opener because it can be personalized in two ways: engraved with just your partner's name or engraved with his name on the front and a message on the back. There are three design styles, circle, diamond and vintage, so choose what would look best for your guy's vibe. 

Before you go, we have a gift for you. **Use code: THEKNOT10 and get 10% off everything in your cart.**

If your boyfriend doesn't want anything specific, grooming essentials will always be good presents for him, since he'll use them up in his daily routine. For those with a bearded S.O., this nourishing oil from Tom Ford will help him keep it in tip-top shape. It's designed to soften and condition facial hair with a blend of almond, jojoba, grapeseed and vitamin E oils that won't feel heavy on his beard or his skin.
