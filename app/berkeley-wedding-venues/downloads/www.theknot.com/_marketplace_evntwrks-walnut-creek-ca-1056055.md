Evntwrks catered our wedding in May and we could not have been happier! We worked with Victoria during the planning process and she did such a nice job from the tasting, to the act...

ual day. Everything turned out just as we imagined and the food was absolutely delicious, multiple guests commented about how good the food was. The whole Evntwrks team was so pleasant on the day of and their bartending staff were some of the nicest bartenders I’ve ever met. The whole team really made sure us as the bride and groom were having a good day, but also focused on making sure every single one of our guests were taken care of as well. We really felt like VIP clients throughout every step of the process and we couldn’t be more grateful for this amazing team. We were able to just sit back and enjoy our day because we knew we were in good hands with the Evntwrks team.

Danny, Liz and the whole team at Evntwrks are the BEST! Creative design, attention to detail, flexibility, helpful with budgets, accommodating, delicious food (the fish wasn't dry...

!) and always looking out for what I wanted for our event. As an event consultant myself, I couldn't recommend them more and look forward to working with them again soon.

We hired Evntwrks for our wedding in October and I could write a lot about our experience but I’ll try to keep this brief. Evntwrks was very smooth during the sales process but p...

lanning the final details and execution of the event was rocky to say the least. For those of us who received a full meal, the food was tasty, but Evntwrks was very slow to dismiss tables and by the last four tables there was no more filet and event staff had to carefully ration what food was left. Evntwrks also advertises floral and wedding rentals but to our dismay, they don’t bring on any additional staff to accommodate these services. This resulted in our producers from Evntwrks (Danny and Liz) working until the last seconds tying bouquets (many of which were not ready for bridal party pictures) and forgetting many floral items from altogether. If you do decide to book with Evntwrks, I suggest you hire an independent day of coordinator. Throughout the sales process Danny was adamant that a day of coordinator is redundant since he would be handling all aspects of our wedding, but on our wedding day they were stretched too thin already with floral, set up, and food prep so coordination was scattered. Wedding days are stressful enough and unfortunately you do not get a do-over so I would suggest you steer clear of these guys.

More than a caterer! We worked with EvntWrks for our October 2023 wedding and they were fantastic! They provided catering, day-of coordination, rentals (reception tables/chairs/e...

tc. plus dance floor, lights, sound system, and ceremony arch), and decoration set-up and clean-up. Victoria, Danny, and Liz were our main contacts and each of them was extremely helpful, great to work with, and focused on making our wedding turn out just like we envisioned it. They also made sure things went smoothly and we actually got to enjoy the day! One reason we selected EvntWrks was because they were a one-stop-shop for almost everything we needed for our wedding, and we are extremely glad we chose them. Working with just one vendor for everything described above greatly simplified our planning process, and Victoria also did a fantastic job coordinating with the other vendors like our shuttle company and the ceremony and reception venue staff. Food: We had a buffet-style 130 person reception at a venue with no kitchen for EvntWrks to use, and everything came out great, just like at our tasting. Our guests gave great feedback about the food, including guests with dietary restrictions, whether they were able to select from the buffet or had one of the special meals EvntWrks prepared for certain diets. There was plenty of everything and they moved folks through the buffet efficiently so that everyone had their food in a reasonable amount of time. They also made sure my husband and I actually got to eat, and we enjoyed the food enough to clean our plates! Coordination: Victoria did a fantastic job both directly and through the rest of the EvntWrks team to make sure everything was ready at both locations so our guests had a seamless experience. One other reason we hired a day-of coordinator was for any unexpected wedding-day "emergencies" and sure enough, when we got a call from a guest that the shuttle stop was blocked by a road closure and the guests couldn't find the shuttles, all we had to do was tell Victoria and she immediately handled it while we got back to spending stress-free quality time with our party preparing for the ceremony. Setup/Cleanup: One of the things that drew us to EvntWrks was the fact that they were willing to set up and clean up decorations in addition to everything else, and they exceeded our expectations on this front. We had relatively complex centerpieces (large home-grown live plants, dozens of origami cranes per table, different sized candles, and favors for every guest), and our guest book and check-in tables were also complex, multi-table affairs with special cameras and instructions. EvntWrks took care of all of it, and all we and our family had to do was enjoy! They let us drop everything off with them ahead of time so we didn't need to transport anything day-of, and their team really listened and cared as I talked through all the decorations at drop-off. They were legitimately enthusiastic about each detail, and that made me feel great! They took great care of even our most delicate decorations and they set everything up perfectly. Summary: We worked with EvntWrks for the majority of our wedding day needs, and are so happy we did. Each individual aspect was executed amazingly with thought and care.

I don’t like leaving nasty reviews and didn’t plan on it, but now I’m feeling absolutely cheated and I’d hate for someone else to spend thousands with this company. There were a fe...

w red flags from the beginning, but we were already kinda locked in with the deposit. I had asked for a floral quote and had a whole intro meeting with Victoria. It took months to respond and she was asking questions we had already answered months prior when we met her. Had to send my mood boards over AGAIN. Seemed unorganized, but we brushed it off because she was very sweet. The day of, my florals did NOT match the inspo at all. They charged 40 bucks per vase, which had one stem of cheap flowers (I’m talking calendula and some filler/foliage.) our bouquets were also WILTED the moment they were handed to us. The food was amazing at our trial and tasted horrible the night of. We got candied brussels that were supposed to be sweet and crisped, and what they served was just steamed, hard, and flavorless. Some appetizers even used different ingredients than what we first tasted. We were told we had table side service and ppl would help pour wine, but no one helped guests, even when they asked. I was able to brush it all off the day of and had a great time, but the cherry on top for me was when I came to pick up my decor and Victoria claimed my guests took everything. I found that hard to believe, as I didn’t even see all the decor I provided on the tables. They were bare. She insisted that they took all centerpieces, and when I asked her to pls check their warehouse again, she found multiple of my boxes. I also took inventory of all my things, and she is now claiming I shorted her on decor so they had to use their own. I was told my table signs and menus would be printed on cardstock, and they were on regular paper and looked super tacky. Not what she had described at all. She also claimed my flowers were wilted because we took photos hours before the wedding, which is FALSE. I took photos with my husband only thirty minutes before guests started to arrive. No bridesmaids even had their flowers till right before they walked up. I planned on doing stuff with my floral after and sadly cannot. It’s one thing to not have everything turn out as planned, but now I’m catching them in lies, which makes it 10x worst for me. Victoria was very kind through the process, but that doesn’t matter to me after spending thousands and expecting QUALITY as promised.

I don't think there are enough words to describe how grateful my husband and I are to have met Danny Buell and his team! Evntwrks did our wedding and the night could not have gone ...

more smoothly and everything was beyond perfect! We used them for florals, coordination, rentals, & catering! In full honesty, I am a control freak and Danny was the one person I trusted to bring my vision together! He earned my respect by being communicative and listening to the most important parts of our day! He was always there for us and is the perfect representation of what a business owner should be! And Tony could not have made more delicious food! Every one of our guests complimented the quality of food and attentiveness of the team! I would give them 10 stars if I could! If you are debating on a quality rental company to make your day a success, trust me and pick EVNTWRKS!!! You won't be sorry! We are forever grateful for making our day flawless!

Evntwrks was so much more than just a caterer for us! From the very beginning, Danny and team were there for us as a partner to create our dream wedding. They not only assisted in ...

the planning process, but also provided all services we could possibly need. Aside from delicious food, they produced stunning florals, lighting, rentals, and they promised our day would go smooth, and over delivering was an understatement!

Danny and team were beyond amazing. We hired Evntwrks for our wedding day planning, decorating, and catering and they met all of our expectations and more. He was so organized from...

the first email to the last detail day of. He had a really great presence and calming nature, which always helps when the chaos of your big day is in full effect. He sparked his personal touches throughout the whole planning and helped Brent and I see our vision through to the awesome party we always dreamed of. So so great! Thank you Danny, Chadd, Katy, Tony, and Mariah CHEERS!!
