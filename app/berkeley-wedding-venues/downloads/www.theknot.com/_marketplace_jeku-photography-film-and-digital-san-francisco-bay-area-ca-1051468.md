INCREDIBLE - can I give Jess 10 stars? Our original wedding was May 2, in Arizona. Due to COVID19, we had to postpone. We decided last weekend to still get married here in San Fran...

cisco, and I frantically reached out to photographers on the Knot. I knew immediately when messaging with Jess that she had an awesome, 'let's do this' vibe! She was down to roll with the punches and ambiguity of how the day would play out - it played out perfectly, and in large part due to having Jess there to document. She was so easy to work with, a great presence to take our photos/document the moment, and really make us feel comfortable. She even sent me a sneak peek of a few photos today, the day after, that are absolutely incredible. I cannot recommend Jess enough- any bride and groom are lucky to work with her!

Jess was an absolute pleasure to work with in helping to capture our special day in San Francisco. From our initial meeting to the day of our nuptials, she was able to bring kindne...

ss, compassion, and a professional perspective. Not only a skilled photographer, but Jess was also able to get us to really open up to the camera and express our excitement for the day and for each other. What we enjoyed most about Jess was her passion to collaborate with us. Because our wedding day happened in October of 2020, she helped us completely rethink what was possible during the pandemic. We managed to still shoot in some of our favorite places in San Francisco, and in our own apartment right before the ceremony. What might have been remembered as a stressful day, she helped us turn into some of our most favorite moments of that entire year. She is a true talent and we were extremely happy with the final product. If you're able to secure Jess for your wedding day, you won't be disappointed.

Jessica was absolutely AMAZING! My finance and I got our engagement photos done by her and they turned out phenomenal. We flew out all the way to San Fran from Texas just to use he...

r! We both don’t really feel comfortable in front of the camera but Jessica made us feel very comfortable and helped position us in photos & they honestly looked very natural in the photos. There was lots of laughing and it was overall an amazing experience. The turn over time to get the photos was super fast! I can’t express how much we love our photos, I honestly cried when I recieved then. She also gave us a great list of locations to take photos so she definitely knows what she’s doing. She’s great with using natural light and making images look amazing. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!

My fiancé and I took our engagement photos with Jessica, and she is absolutely stellar! She is very responsive to messages and is good at communicating. I explained to her what ...

I wanted for our photos, and she was able to offer up shoot location ideas. She ended up helping us pick a location that suited our style perfectly. Unfortunately, out first shoot got rained out. Jessica was really flexible and helped us get our shoot rescheduled ASAP. When the next date came along, we got luckier with the weather. Jessica was right on time, which I really appreciated. She was so friendly and kind, she really put us at ease. We were worried that we wouldn't know how to pose, but she was an amazing coach. She took posed photos, and gave us instructions for things that we could do to get candid photos, too. The shoot was so much fun! She sent us a sneak peek photo the same day, which was so sweet of her! She gave us a very clear estimate on when we could expect the full set of photos and she delivered them right on time. Folks, let me tell you... I cried when I saw them, my future mother-in-law cried when she saw them, and my fiancé even got a little teary when he saw them. They're everything I ever wanted. I can tell that Jessica really put a lot of thought into which photos to give me. It's a really well rounded collection. She's very talented, and has such a sweet, modern style. My brother and his fiancé loved our photos so much that they booked a session with her, too! Overall just an amazing experience, I absolutely cherish our photos, and will be using Jessica's services again!
