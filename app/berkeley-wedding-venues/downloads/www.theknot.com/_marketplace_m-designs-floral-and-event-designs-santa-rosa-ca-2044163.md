Maria and her team were a joy to work with. Maria perfectly executed my daughter's vision from the bud vases on the tables to the "trees" she built inside the tent on the poles. ...

She even came to the rescue literally minutes before the ceremony when we realized we had not given her an updated count for the bridesmaids bouquets. She whipped a matching one up in a matter of minutes. I would highly recommend M Design Floral Events!!!

ed out amazing! I loved all of our flowers and they are beautiful in pictures. She was very responsive and passionate about what she does. The day of she took so much care with our flowers, even waiting to put our wine barrel pieces out because they would be directly in the sun and she wanted them to look perfect and not wilt. She also helped move our altar pieces into our reception, staying until after the ceremony. I cannot recommend her enough. Thank you Maria!

unning. I asked for something that was outside of the norm on her website (simply, elegant flower). I was a tad worried about it, but as soon as I saw all the flowers up, it looked PERFECT! I got lots of positive feedback and the flowers truly brought everything together. Thank you and I hope we can work together again the future!

Maria is just the best. I was initially going to do my own flowers with friends and family, but ultimately decided I just didn't want everyone to have another thing to do that week...

end. But Maria was flexible with us, helping me get bulk flowers so we could do some of our small bud vases on the dining tables, and creating beautiful bouquets/boutonnieres for the wedding party. She made the most beautiful ceremony sprays, and the couple that got married the next day at our venue asked us if they could use them because they were so much better than theirs! Maria took my thoughts and just nailed it--we called it "organic but organized". She got me some of my favorite flowers in colors that really worked nicely, and was so accommodating, letting us store our bud vases with her for cooling. It was exceptionally easy working with her, and wedding planning turns out not to be exceptionally easy, so I would enthusiastically recommend M Designs! As a bonus, we used the arrangements at the next day brunch, and my mom said they lasted for over a week after the wedding. Not necessary, of course, but a sign she uses fresh flowers and takes great care of them!

s she creates. We could not have dreamed of a better person to do the flowers for our wedding. As we navigated our way through making changes due to COVID-19's impact, Maria was flexible and partnered with us to make sure we had exactly what we needed for our wedding day. We would trust no one else to create flowers for our wedding, and we look forward to working with her again for a 1 year affirmation of vows.
