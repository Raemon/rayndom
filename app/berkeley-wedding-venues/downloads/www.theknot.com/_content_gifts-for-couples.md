## What Is a Good Gift for a Married Couple?

Still wondering what makes a good couples gift? Simply put, it's anything they can enjoy together. To make it more personalized to the duo you're shopping for, think about their specific hobbies and interests. A [couple who likes the outdoors](https://www.theknot.com/content/gifts-for-hiking-lovers) could benefit from a double hammock, while homebodies would likely have more fun with a [couples board game](https://www.theknot.com/content/couples-board-games). You can also look for gifts customized with their initials.

Another way to choose a good couple's gift is to think of the reason (and even the season) behind the gesture. An [experience gift for couples](https://www.theknot.com/content/gift-experiences-for-couples) is good for their wedding anniversary because it provides quality time together, allowing them to reconnect as they start another year of married bliss. On the other hand, a Christmas gift idea for couples could play on the cold weather, like a set of matching mugs with luxury hot chocolate and a soft throw blanket so they're ready for cozy nights in.
