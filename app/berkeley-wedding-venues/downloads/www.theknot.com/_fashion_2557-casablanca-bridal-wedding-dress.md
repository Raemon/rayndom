Description

Style 2557 Forentina is the sister style to our 2556, reimagined with a modern twist. This mini dress is perfect for the bride who seeks a contemporary and chic bridal look that combines sophistication with a touch of playfulness. The tank strap bodice of Forentina features a flattering scoop neckline, showcasing your shoulders and collarbone with grace. Crafted from luxurious Mikado fabric, this gown exudes a sense of refined beauty. Handmade Mikado 3D flowers adorn the dress, adding texture and visual interest that is both unique and eye-catching. Forentina may be a mini dress, but it doesn't compromise on style. It embraces the beauty of a shorter hemline, allowing you to show off some leg and create a youthful and modern bridal look. This style is perfect for intimate ceremonies or receptions, or for the bride who desires a second dress to dance the night away. Whether you choose to wear Forentina for your entire celebration or as a statement second dress, it will undoubtedly make a lasting impression. It's a dress that allows you to embrace your individuality and showcase your unique style with confidence.
