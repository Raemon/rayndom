**Bridal shower bingo:** What is It? | What You Need | How to Play | Editor's Picks

## What Is Bridal Shower Bingo?

At a bridal shower, bingo is mostly the same game you know and love, but with a few key differences to stay on theme. Bingo bridal shower games come in both premade sets and empty squares for guests to fill in, meaning you can choose which one suits your party best. It's an interactive way to let everyone mingle, as well as encourage some friendly competition. And since this game requires few supplies, it's a hit with any shower budget. With bingo, all you need is a little luck, which is what makes this game so popular. Anyone can win, and you can fill up time with repeat games and multiple prizes for winners.

## What You Need for Bridal Shower Bingo

No doubt you've played a game of bingo or two in your lifetime, but how about wedding shower bingo? There are some other things to consider for this exciting version, so here's the play-by-play for your party game.

### Printing/Customizing

As the host, whether you're ordering printed bingo cards or creating your own, ensure that any customizable options line up with your theme and color palette. For at-home printing, stock up on stock paper, ink and any embellishments (like stickers instead of chips) for each card. For mail orders, double-check everything looks correct upon arrival before the party. 

### Passing Items Out

At the party, give out cards, pen/chips and something sturdy to write on before the game. You can also set up a table with signage for the bingo cards, but be certain it's in an area where everyone can see it well, along with any rules to know during the party. 

### Playing Bingo

Since some games might be different from typical bingo, announce any new rules or things to know so everyone is caught up. For example, you likely won't be yelling out numbers or letters, so tell guests what they will need to look for on their cards to win the game.

### Winning the Game

There are many ways to win bingo. Five in a row across or diagonally, four corners or a square are the usual methods. However, your bridal shower, your rules. See how creative you can get to increase the odds of guests winning.

## How to Play Bridal Shower Bingo

There are a few different types of bingo formats, and for wedding showers specifically, this can vary from fill-in-the-blank cards to ready-to-go squares with chips. Here are some things to know about these varied bingo games and how to play them.

### Bridal Shower Gift Bingo

  * Pass out cards and pens to guests before opening gifts.
  * Guests will fill in each square with items they think the to-be-wed will receive during the party.
  * While opening presents, guests can mark the correct squares for each item.
  * Five in a row, four corners or a square can be bingo.



### I Spy Bingo

  * Pass out cards and chips to loved ones.
  * For this version, guests can either try finding the squares on their own, or you can call out the items on the squares.
  * If party-goers are finding the items throughout the event, the first to shout bingo wins.



### Find the Guest Bingo

  * Pass out cards and chips to party guests.
  * On each card, there will be prompts for finding someone at the party to match the square. ("Is the eldest sibling." "Went to college with the bride." Etc.)
  * The first guest to match enough squares for bingo wins.
