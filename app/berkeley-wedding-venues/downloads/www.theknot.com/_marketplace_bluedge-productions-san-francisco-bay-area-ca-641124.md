Dj James Miranda DJed our wedding & we can't recommend him enough!!! He met with use frequently through the planning process to make sure our vision was met. He was super reachable...

and we were able to get in touch with him anytime we needed. He even made an instrumental version of "Killing in the name of" for our grand entrance, which was amazing! We were worried that our guests wouldn't dance that much, but James kept everyone on the floor the whole time! Even my parents were out there start to finish. Multiple guests commented how great the music selection and flow was. So if you are looking for a DJ to make an amazing event into the perfect night, James is your man.

We and our guests loved DJ King James at our wedding. The dance floor was packed from start until the end of the night. He did a nice job setting up the uplighting as well. He was ...

also super chill and flexible to work with. We received numerous compliments about the DJ from our guests. I’m shocked how affordable BluEdge is–they did our lighting, ceremony microphones and music, cocktail hour music, dinner music, and dance DJing all for a very reasonable price.

You guys executed everything flawlessly and we are still getting compliments from family and our guests!

If I could give 10 stars to the Bluedge Entertainment, and Dj James I totaly would. My top priority for the night was to keep everyone on the dancefloor since we have a big family ...

and we all LOVE to dance...and Dj James totally delivered. We gave him a list of songs we wanted to be played during our reception and he blended each song beautifully for just the right amount of time so I never felt a song was dragging on for too long. It’s been months since our wedding and our guests are still raving about how awesome the music was! The professionalism of the whole Bluedge team was also unparalleled. Cherish our point of contact always quick and responsive with any questions we had and we felt completely taken care of. On the day of our wedding, James showed up early and completely prepared. He set our officiant and my husband up with lapel mics and the timing of our ceremony songs were perfectly played... for my song, I wanted it to start at a very specific place and during our rehearsal I was a bit worried it wouldn’t workout, but James NAILED it perfectly! I wish I had another excuse to book the Bluedge Entertainment - my friends and family are still raving about how much fun they had and I'm still reliving all of the dance circles and conga lines from that evening... BOOK THEM - you will not be disappointed!!

Dj Quan is the BEST - we could not have been happier with his work at our wedding!!! He kept everyone dancing the entire night, and I've had so many people tell me that he was the ...

best DJ they've heard at a wedding. He really stayed true to the input that we provided, both by playing our "must have" songs, but also reading the dancefloor and tailoring the entire set to match what kept people going. It was just great song after great song. Quan is also incredibly professional and so easy to work with. I went back and forth on some of the logistics, and it never fazed him. He even created a medley for our first dance that came out Perfect. super accommodating! You can tell that Quan is very passionate about his craft and about his clients. Highly, highly recommend!!

I would book bluEDGE for all my events if I could, except, I don’t have any parties coming up. Thank goodness because I am still recovering from my wedding 2 months ago. But I 100%...

definitely will book them again. No doubt! Here’s why. They are awesome! My husband and I had the pleasure working with DJ Quan, Philippe, and bilingual translator Shirley. My initial point of contact was with Philippe and he was so helpful and informative that I had to book him without hesitation. Philippe was very accommodating. He worked around our schedule with meet and greets. He came out to the venue to look at the space and gave suggestions on where would be the best place for the DJ and photobooth. He gave pointers on the floor plan, type of music for our intimate wedding, wedding games. It was so helpful given that my husband and I had no clue what-so-ever what we were doing. Quan took it to the next level with his expertise on wedding planning. He was a tremendous help with our wedding schedule. Like I said. We are clueless to wedding planning. Quan helped us organize our schedule and made sure we can squeeze everything in 4 hours time. From when we start the grand entrance (and we started late because some of my guests arrived late) to games and cake cutting. And we still had time to spare and it was not rushed at all. Besides helping with the wedding planning, we really loved how laid back and welcoming bluEDGE is. They are such nice and genuine people. Every time I see them on stage, they are looking out into the crowd with a smile on their face, genuinely happy that the guests are enjoying themselves. I can write forever but like I said, I will book them without a doubt! No hesitation! And I would recommend them to anyone and everyone! Thank you so much Quan, Philippe, Shirley, and bluEDGE for your hard work!!!!

I started out as a cost-conscious bride who was seriously considering DIY our DJing with a playlist on an iPod. But after talking things over with my husband and friends that just ...

got married, I finally relented, realizing it was more important to ensure our wedding guests would have a great time. And wow, am I glad we went with bluEdge Entertainment! Leading up to the wedding, we worked with Cherish, and our actual DJ was James. Cherish was very communicative and helpful when I had a ton of questions. Their music and pronunciations forms were extremely helpful. Admiddinly there were a few key songs we didn't choose till days before the wedding, but they were able to accomodate nonetheless. I was also very passionate about our dancing playlist, and James promised he would do his best to honor all my requests while balancing with reading the crowd to make sure the guests had a great time. Fast forward to the day of our wedding - everything was PERFECT. First, James did a great job timing all of our songs for our ceremony and making sure the vows sounded great. Next, we got to hear James's emcee/DJ voice for the first time, and he was amazing! Energetic and professional without being cheesy or overbearing. He did a great introduction during our wedding party reentrance, and then NAILED our soul train request right after our first dance to get everyone on the dancefloor!! (I honestly was a little nervous about it since it was something we decided to do lastminute and did really know how it was going to turnout). We were ecstatic. Once the dancing started, he read the crowd to play the best of our list and kept our guests dancing nonstop. It was a fantastic time! I'm so glad my husband and girlfriend talked me out of the iPod idea. We can't thank James and Cherish enough!!

He accommodated all our song requests and made our wedding very fun and exciting. The contact and discussions were easy and painless.

Everyone had a great time, and we are so thankful for making our special day memorable!

They made it very easy to set up all our music selections. I can’t count how many time we had our guests come up to me raving about the music and the Dj. Our dance was packed the entire time. Everyone had the BEST time. I highly recommend bluEDGE Entertainment, and Dj James to anyone!

bluEDGE and DJ Quan did a fantastic job at our wedding at the SF Zoo. We had four locations in the zoo for our wedding. There was a ton of coordination but bE was more than flexibl...

e and worked with us to create an outstanding experience in each location. Three examples stand out in my mind: #1 Quan and his team show-up and are very prepared. All our meetings were productive and we never felt like our time was being wasted or that we have to repeat ourselves. They take notes, proactively communicate, and help brainstorm solutions with you. #2 bE is very flexible. We had an Indian priest who sprung on us the day before the wedding that he wanted to be microphoned-up. With less than 24 hours notice, we were able to work with bE to get the speakers and mics added to the list, and for a very reasonable price! We never felt underserved or that we paid more than a fair price for anything with bE. #3 Quan brought everyone to the dance floor. We wanted a party on the dance floor and that's exactly what we got. The dance floor was packed within 3 mins of opening-up and still have a dozen folks dancing after 2 hours (including my wife and me) when everything shut down. We provided Quan with the types of songs we liked and he took those suggestions and created a wonderful set, including sticking in a few Indian bhangra songs. We couldn't be happier with everything and bE helped make our wedding day the best day of my life!

From our first meeting with James, we knew he was a good fit. He was able to quickly grasp our taste in music and even provided some great recommendations for songs we hadn't thought of. On our wedding day James and his staff showed up very early. I was very impressed with how beautiful our reception spaced looked with the lights, our named monogram, and draping backdrop for our head table. During our reception, James had great energy addressing our guests and announcing our dances. My husband and I were getting pulled in so many directions, but it was hard to leave the dance floor because the music was so good. We also really enjoyed the flipbooks. Several guests told us at the end of the night it was one of the best weddings they’ve attended. We truly appreciate James and their staff for ensuring our big day was perfect, and I would recommend bluEdge Productions in a heartbeat to anyone looking for a great company to make their wedding memorable. you will not be disappointed!

response, impressive skill set, professional packages, and great pricing. We had BluEdge for our photo booth, our outdoor lighting, and DJ services. All were more than 5 stars in service. I felt like I could trust them with so many pieces of my wedding thanks to the quick communication throughout the whole process. For our wedding I took every step in the process very seriously and I managed all of the planning for my wedding so I cared a lot. Quan was amazing because throughout the reception him and I were in sync about moving some of the timeline around. He was flexible, nice, offered great recommendations throughout the process. The music was amazing, our guests LOVED the photo booth, the service was 200% - they really went above and beyond. I would HIGHLY recommend them, like if you were my friend and we were getting coffee and you asked me who you should have as a vendor for your wedding I would tell you get BluEdge and dont bother looking anywhere else haha. Quan and the whole BluEdge team really care about you and your event. Or, at least that is how I felt. I felt like I was really valued, taken care of, and that my event was as important to them as it was to me. I wish I could give plus stars.

very professional and helpful during our consultation and he delivered a flawless performance on our wedding day. We had an international crowd and he did an excellent job in reading the crowd and keeping the dance floor packed. We loved his music selections and he played all our requests as well as requests from our guests. They also did a great job with our monogram and texture and up-lights. Sam was very happy with their work. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for a high quality DJ Company!

We give Jeep and Bluedge productions five stars for making our wedding night so memorable, and stress free! After a whole month of researching the perfect Dj and entertainment com...

pany for our wedding, we were torn between our venue’s recommendation and Bluedge Productions. Their website and Jeep’s skills from his demo impressed us off the bat, but were still not convinced at that point. But after our meeting with Jeep we were sold. He was very knowledgeable and professional in his presentation, and we can tell he was very passionate about music. We really loved the promptness in communication and his willingness and flexibility to meet our demanding schedules. Everything looked flawless during our first look on our wedding day. The up lighting was exactly what we wanted, and the flipbook was so much fun! Jeep injected humor in his announcement and really made the entire night fun and energetic. He played our jams and kept our guests on the dance floor the entire time. He even masterfully accommodated some obscure requests from my mom without killing the vibe! Jeep, a huge thank you to you and your staff for an unforgettable night. We are so happy with everything. We highly recommend Jeep and bluEDGE Productions!

d thorough during planning. On our wedding day, they showed up super early, and were very accommodating. I changed my mind on our uplighting color last min and they made the changes immediately. The music for the entire wedding was flawless. Jeep not only was able to incorporate our requests and last minute changes, he had everyone busting moves on the dance floor!. The photo booth was great too. Loved their props and Tyler was great with all my guests. Would hire them again in a heart beat. Great work, and Thank you guys for making my wedding so much fun, and stress free!

nd entertaining MC. He had to play music in 3 different areas of our venue and he did it seamlessly. All our wedding guests were extremely impressed with him. He got EVERYONE dancing and he kept the party going until the end. DJ Jeep who was my first contact at bluEdge was very responsive, professional and helpful until after the wedding. He made sure the company met our expectation. We strongly recommend bluEdge and DJ James. AWESOME JOB!

BlueEDGE productions was a perfect vendor to work with for our spring wedding. We were able to bundle three different services (uplighting, DJ and photobooth) and were VERY pleased...

with BlueEDGE. From the beginning they were very professional and prompt. They had great communication. The MCing was exactly what we were looking for. The uplighting looked fantastic. The photobooth was a big hit and worked great. The music was exactly like we asked and DJ Quan did a great job around tailoring it to who was on the dance floor as well as the current vibe. Choosing BlueEDGE will make your life easier and your event fantastic.

We just want to acknowledge the great work Jeep and the Bluedge team did for our wedding in December. Jeep was very professional and articulate in explaining the different package...

options, and answering our extensive list of questions. I was very appreciative of the fast response time for all of our emails and calls. He took the time to really understand our unique situation, and made sure all of our special requests where played. Our family and friends all had a great time dancing to his tunes. We also had so much fun with the flip book station. Tyler and Eric where super friendly and helpful. All in all, our wedding was a great success with tons of beautiful and joyous memories to treasure, and the entertainment was a big part of it…so Thank You Jeep and Bluedge for helping us create our prefect wedding!

Nothing but good things to say about these guys! They were very professional from beginning to end. We met with James, our Dj pretty early during the planning stages. He was v...

ery knowledgeable and easy going. Really helped us figure out a lot of logistic details we didn't even think of. The communication was quick, and it was great not having to deal with multiple vendors. James nailed all the announcement; We had some pretty hard to pronounce names. Our dance floor was packed, and everyone was dancing. We got really good feedback from our guests on the flip books. The lighting was great as well. Everything went smoothly without a hitch...we couldn't ask for more. Thank you!

DJ Quan was the best!!! Quan was the MC/DJ at our wedding on October 3rd and we could not have asked for a better DJ! We have gotten so many compliments on the music and DJ Quan. ...

He kept the dance floor full 'til the end. He went above and beyond and we couldn't be more grateful. He was prompt, the sound system was top notch and was so easy and helpful throughout the whole planning process. PLannnig a wedding can be very stressfu, but DJ Quan and BluEdge Productions were top vendors and one of our favorites! Highly recommend them.

One word - AMAZING! I hired BluEdge for a few services for my wedding – Photo Booth, DJ, and Lighting. Communication was great - they always answered my emails/calls promptly and ...

throughly, which is one of the reasons why I chose them over other vendors. I worked with both Quan and Felix – such great people to work with – very accommodating, professional, kind, and knowledgeable. Felix was our DJ – we did not give him much direction yet he did such a great job – people were dancing throughout the night and it was evident people enjoyed the music he played! Quan and his staff set up the lighting - which included lanterns and string lights, and up lighting - they spent the whole day at the venue - which took place in the backyard in the blistering heat. He made sure everything looked perfect, functioned properly and most importantly made sure it was how I envisioned the space to look. I could not be happier with the final product - truly beautiful job. As for the photo booth, they offered the open space option which was what I was looking for. The photos looked great and there were also a variety of props that guests were able to use too! I honestly cannot emphasize how wonderful BluEdge Productions was to work with. I would recommend them to anyone! Thank you BluEdge team!!

bluEDGE Productions did a wonderful job at our wedding! We used them for DJ, lighting and photobooth services. It was very conveinent to have one company handle so many things and ...

they gave us a deal for bundling services which made their rates very fair and reasonable. DJ Quan did an excellent job as our DJ and MC! Everyone loved the music and our wedding turned into a huge dance party which is exactly what we wanted! They set up market lights for the dinner area and uplighting in the dance area and everything looked amazing! I hardly recognized the venue after they were done working their magic! They were very easy to work with, always responded to my emails promptly and Quan met me twice at the venue which was very helpful! This is a great group to work with and I would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a great DJ, lighting &/or photobooth!

as. We had a bit of a mash up wedding as I am Cuban and my husband is Ukrainian so there was a crazy mix of music. DJ Quan played every song we requested at the perfect time and the mix of music was done perfectly. He worked very well with my wedding planner and the night went on without a single hiccup! I could not have asked for a better DJ.
