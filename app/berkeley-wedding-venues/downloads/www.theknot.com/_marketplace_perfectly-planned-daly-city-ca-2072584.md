We absolutely loved having Perfectly Planned as our wedding planner & coordinator and would highly recommend. After settling on our venue, my now-husband and I knew we were going t...

o need some help to keep us focused & on-track for the big day. Neither of us is the alpha-planner type, nor did we have any bold convictions about wedding planning, so we needed some help. From the start, Yvonne brought a level of organization and experience that made the whole process feel manageable and exciting. With PP’s help, we molded & crystalized our vision for the event, what was important to us, and how we could make it feel genuinely us. We didn’t want to just go through the motions for a cookie cutter wedding. PP provided a well-structured timeline of tasks, checked in frequently, made tons of great vendor intros, and kept all the balls in the air in the lead-up week. It was super useful to have someone as experienced and detail-focused as Yvonne in our corner to answer our questions & explain different options without biasing our decisions. Outside of our video call checkins, I appreciated the casual texting for one-off questions & ideas, especially in the final 2 weeks. During the big day, she kept the show running smoothly & on-time as inevitable hiccups came up. We were able to completely remove ourselves from the logistics and just focus on being present as the night went on. The whole weekend turned out even better than we’d hoped and a lot of that credit is due to Perfectly Planned. We heard so many nice comments afterwards about how smoothly everything went and how cohesive the night felt. PP made us look like rock star party organizers!

I was especially happy with how she orchestrated the clean up at the end of the night and organized our belongings.

e knew what was coming and how to pace ourselves. She connected us with great vendors and made decision-making easy — never pressuring us, but always offering thoughtful, well-informed advice. As the date got closer, she took on so much of the mental load, checking in and managing our to-do list with bite-sized next steps. The week of, she handled last-minute changes with total calm, fixing things quickly and without needing to loop us in. And on the day itself, everything ran flawlessly, exactly according to her master plan. We could not recommend Yvonne more!

until we interviewed multiple planners and I immediately felt comfortable with Yvonne the second we started talking! She was so fun and easy to chat with, and didn't make us feel judged about how we didn't have a strong vision for our wedding initially, instead helping us talk through our priorities and offering ideas without pressure. Throughout the process it was so easy to stay connected with her - she was accessible by text, email, phone, and for virtual meetings, which was so helpful since we planned our wedding remotely. I felt like I could ask her anything without feeling silly. Of course she was also impeccably organized and knowledgeable, communicated clearly with our vendors, and ran everything with calm competence during our wedding weekend. As a Type A girl myself, I was really able to let go with her by our side. My husband repeatedly said "we'll just do whatever Yvonne says" throughout the day. We could also just really feel that she was actually invested in our day and our relationship, which makes such a difference. If we had to do it over again, we would 100% hire Yvonne, no question, no notes. (As a bonus, she speaks Cantonese which was really clutch with our dimsum restaurant venue!)

ve big shoes to fill when she moves on! She’s experienced and knowledgeable but never pushy. I trusted her to give feedback on our ideas based on her experience without ever telling us what to do. A true pro. She truly cares about executing your ideas, not changing them to her tastes which really allowed our day to feel like an authentic reflection of us. She’s confident and competent but approachable and friendly. I never felt like she was trying to upsell us. I ended up hiring her for additional coordination and month-of support and she answered every tiny question we had throughout the process. She was truly the glue holding everything together on our actual day. Emotions and andrenaline run so high on your wedding day I cannot imagine pulling such a big event off without someone level headed and organized like Yvonne in your corner behind the scenes! We were able to actually enjoy our wedding because we knew she had a detailed itinerary and we trusted her to make sure everything ran smoothly. We cannot thank her or recommend her enough!

or me being new to having a wedding, Yvonne really relieved my partner and I from many stressors that could’ve occurred. She really served us as a month of coordinator since she got in touch with us a month prior and helped us with developing a timeline, contacted our vendors for deliveries or services, and even did an amazing job checking in with us to just see how we were doing and feeling prior to the big day. She is very personable and easy to reach out to - whether that is in person, via text, or phone. When it came to the day of, she explained and guided me (the bride) on where to go and what to do.

Exceptional Wedding Vendor This is a well overdue review from us - my husband and I recently had the pleasure of working with Yvonne for our wedding, and we cannot express how gr...

ateful we are for her exceptional service. From start to finish, Yvonne went above and beyond to ensure our special day went off without a hitch. Here's why we highly recommend her for your wedding: Punctuality and Time Management: Yvonne played a crucial role in helping us stay on track with our wedding day schedule. She meticulously coordinated with all the vendors to ensure everything happened on time, from the ceremony to the reception. Her attention to detail in this aspect alleviated so much stress, allowing us to fully enjoy our day. Outstanding Responsiveness: Communication was a breeze with Yvonne. She was incredibly responsive to our emails and questions (within 24-48 hrs.), making us feel heard and valued. Her quick response time and willingness to address any concerns or inquiries put us at ease throughout the planning process. To be honest, responsiveness is one of the things I value most even at work, so was grateful that Yvonne alleviated the stress of having to follow-up or wait for responses. Thoughtful Extras: Yvonne truly understands the ins and outs of wedding planning. She brought up aspects we hadn't even considered, helping us think of aspects we wouldn't even had thought about (e.g. suggestion on how to manage our timeline and keeping dinner not too late into the program, etc.). Her expertise ensured that we didn't overlook any important details, ensuring a seamless and memorable event. Creative Decorations/Ability to Get Hands-On: One of the standout moments was when Yvonne took charge of our welcome table when we just didn't have the time and mental capacity to do it ourselves (we didn't neither a wedding planner nor groom/bridal party to help out). We provided minimal instructions, but she transformed our vision into a stunning reality for the welcome table we saw on the way to make the entrance. Calm and Composed: Throughout the day, Yvonne remained calm, composed, and adaptable. Her ability to handle any unexpected challenges discreetly and efficiently was a testament to her professionalism and experience. She allowed us to savor every moment without worrying about the little things. In conclusion, Yvonne played a pivotal role in making our wedding day an unforgettable experience. Her dedication, responsiveness, attention to detail, and creative expertise were invaluable. We wholeheartedly recommend Yvonne to any couple looking for a wedding vendor who will not only meet but exceed their expectations. Thank you, Yvonne, for being part of our planning and execution of our big day!

xperienced with all the wedding related stuff, which helps a lot. She guided us though the whole process, set up a timeline, budget, floor map and so many other details that came with her tons of experience planning so many weddings and events before. She knew how stressful the process can be, so she was always trying to help, coming up with suggestions, reminding us with what needs attention on a timely manner, to make sure everything stays on course. We had to make so many changes with our plans, and not only was she always very flexible and tried to accommodate such changes and needs, she was very supportive and tried to propose alternative whenever needed. On the wedding day, Yvonne and her stuff were working non stop to make sure every thing went according to the plan, they helped us set up extra decorations that we got, help with setting up the wedding theme, guide our guests, vendors and the bridal party. It was a long and memorable day, and Yvonne did a great job in helping everyone sticking with the plan and timeline, coordinating between the vendors, communicating to us clearly to help us and the party sticking to the plan, and taking care of any situations that might need attention. She did an amazing job, the day went according to plan, she tried to make the process as stress free as possible, everyone left with great and happy memories, and above all, it was always assuring to have her around throughout the day. We knew we were in good hands. Thank you very much for everything Yvonne.

is important and what is not. She was easy to communicate with - she was direct and up-front about important things like cost and rules and timelines, which alleviated stress and cut through ambiguity. She worked with our specific requests without any kind of judgment or nudging to increase the cost of the wedding, something inherent to lots of aspects in the wedding industry. Yvonne clearly had a lot of experience with hosting weddings, and was able to manage many little details for us (i.e. how the space should be arranged for dinner, how much time is needed for a speech or first dance, whether our officiant should use a podium or a folder, etc etc etc). When you don't know what you don't know, Yvonne could be relied on. Lastly, Yvonne was really cool so having her around throughout the process was a fun little bonus!

She checked in with us throughout the day and kept the timeline moving all without us ever feeling stressed or wondering what time it was. She made sure we had private time with appetizers before dinner and had food and drinks brought to our table during the reception. I know that Yvonne can handle anything thrown her way and I would trust her completely to plan my wedding. Thanks for everything, Yvonne!

e and made sure she understood what was important to us for our special day. She is detailed oriented and made sure everything was perfect on the day of the wedding -- from the welcome sign to the cake cutting and the last dance! We knew we were in good hands on our wedding day and could focus on enjoying celebrating with family and friend instead of stressing about the little details. Yvonne handled it all and our wedding day turned out to be one of the most memorable days of our lives. We can't speak more highly of Yvonne. She is professional, thoughtful, personable and just a wonderful person. A year after our wedding, she invited us back to the wedding venue to have dinner and celebrate our one year anniversary. It was an incredibly warm gesture! We highly recommend Yvonne for planning any special occasions! She will go above and beyond to make sure your event will be Perfectly Planned!

and wants to ensure that you have the best experience possible. No detail is too small for her to notice and take care of. She approaches wedding planning and design with thoughtfulness, kindness, intelligence, and fun. This approach was consistent during our 2.5-year experience with her and the club (our wedding was initially March 2020 and was rescheduled to March 2022).

Where do I begin? When I first initially got engaged, I knew right off my wedding would not be your typical traditional wedding. We needed someone to understand both Chinese and V...

ietnamese culture. And I have to say Yvonne did just the job! Yvonne understood our wants/needs on the big day. Her attention to detail was superb. To ensure we had enough time for everything she carefully planned out our day knowing there were certain items we needed done on the day of. To start doorgames! Yvonne knew this would be the start of the day and generally may take some time of the games to finish, so she perfectly planned out various tasks/challenges that best suited the groom/groomsmen in addition to staying on track for our packed scheduled. Examples of some of the games: 1st round “How well do you know your wife” for every question wrong, each groomsman would have to carry the groom in a different “child” position since I used to be a babysitter. There were a few other rounds in between, but the last game was having them “sing” to me while the groomsmen either danced or was backup singers. Because Yvonne took the time the get to know the parties, she assigned dancers knowing some groomsmen wouldn’t, and preferred singing vice versa to make it fun and interesting. After the doorgames was the tea ceremony on my side (the brides) family. If anyone knows it gets very chaotic during the first few hours, with many family members crowding around, and having to have a new set of teacups and tea poured each time. Thankfully Yvonne knew ahead of time what was needed and was able to assign tasks for the bridal party to get ready. From the pillows on the floor, to the flow of tea being poured, we were able to go through each family we had to pour tea for in a timely manner. We had quite a lot of travel day of so Yvonne really helped our vendors keep on track. She was able to plan out the timing so that when we arrived at my husband’s side of the family the photographers were able to capture the first and last moments. Lastly our wedding reception. We had our celebration at a restaurant, so décor was something challenging to work with as the space couldn’t be changed too much. During this process Yvonne really helped captured what we both enjoyed/like. For starters the centerpieces. We didn’t want too much floral but also didn’t want empty tables. She came up with the idea of having fishbowls in every other table with goldfish to capture my husbands love for fishing, and we can raffle off the centerpieces. All in all, Yvonne was very organized and thoughtful throughout this process for my husband and I. She reminded us of what certain tasks needed to be done, even if we couldn’t make those deadlines, she was able to make it work for us. She ensured that we didn’t have to worry about the backend of things, and that we just needed to be present. I entirely trusted the process with her and thankful she took the time to sit with me to understand the wants and needs ahead of time and asked for my input as needed. The best decision for us was working with her and being open to her ideas.

All the changes went to the new date smoothly and everything leading up to the event was properly adjusted. When 2021 finally came around we were so excited to start the planning process again and with the help of Yvonne and the team it was perfect. The menu tasting was delicious and gave us a full scope of the evenings options. Yvonne provided great suggestions that allowed us to adjust our choices without having to taste them. She helped with my reception arrangement and all the decor. It was a true blessing to be able to explain my vision to Yvonne and have her bring it to light! The night went off without a hitch…she knew what to do and when to do it all at the perfect moment to ensure the day went perfectly. Beyond blessed to have had her by my side through this process.

My daughter was living in Washington DC and I live in southern California so we could not just pop in and see Yvonne, so she was very responsive to our needs. The wedding went off without a hitch and she was there throughout to ensure everything went smoothly. The day was perfect and so many guests raved about the food and the service. I thought after the reception that we had to pack up all our personal items we brought for the wedding (chargers, easels, guest table items) Yvonne packed up everything for us and stored it in a safe location so that the next morning we loaded them into our vehicles. I would not hesitate to use her again. She was great!!

ings got overwhelming, Yvonne Lau came in and guided us. She was able to ease our fears about different wedding details, so we could focus on others. An example of this is our wedding menu. We explained to Yvonne we were looking for a menu to accommodate our Indian and Italian families. We threw a bunch of ideas at her and she ran with them. After our tasting, I wasn’t nervous any more, about anything. The food was amazing; I’ve never been to a wedding where so many people talked about how good the food was. She was extremely easy to work with, very professional and down to earth at the same time. We had a fantastic wedding that exceeded our expectations and Yvonne was a big reason why. We highly recommend her.

nd I toured our wedding venue in the month we got engaged (September 2018) to her comforting words and presence just seconds before I walked down the aisle to my now husband (July 2019), Yvonne was right there. Any questions I had or just needed to run an idea through, Yvonne was there via phone, text, email, in person-you name it. Wedding planning is just plain stressful and you need that go to person there by your side (aside from your partner of course!) to help carry out your vision. Yvonne was there through all the good, the bad and the ugly to keep me sane through it all. I still get emotional thinking about her role as my wedding planner and how she went above and beyond for me every step of the way. These lasting memories, I will never forget. I highly recommend hiring Yvonne as your wedding planner for your upcoming wedding. She is an expert in her field and I can’t express how comforting it is to know you will be in good hands throughout this exciting chapter in your life.
