The food they made was absolutely delicious! Our guests were raving about it and I think almost everyone went back for seconds! We can't recommend them enough! Thank you Wali, Sonia and Dennis for helping making our wedding dreams come true.

ul to identify menu items. Also liked that tasting fee was credited to overall bill. Due to venue constraints, opted to have food dropped off the day of the event in lieu of prepared onsite. When there was a mix-up with one of the sides, catering staff quickly returned back to the venue with the correct item. Would definitely recommend for your catering needs and I will definitely book with them in the future!

or a future event. This included rental supplies, not just food. I understand the opportunity costs for Dennis, but he had a couple weeks to find a gig, he no longer had to pay others for help, and could have saved on supplies and still offered a partial refund. Because he refused to provide any sort of refund I made him make me the food anyway and donated it to charity. But I would have much preferred a refund. This is an incredibly painful experience, and Dennis made it worse.

The apps was totally demolished by our guests and the salad and sides (hello the bread service was excellent!) were customized for what we wanted: fusion of Greek and Filipino. Dennis and the team make beautiful food! Which was great for us foodies.

It's been a month since our wedding and people are still talking to me about how amazing the food was (get the Cadillac mashed potatoes) You won't regret working with this team and their delicious food!

Our Day of Coordinator recommended Liberation Foods because she knew we were on a budget and were looking for affordable, quality food, and both things were absolutely true, so I a...

m glad that I stuck with them. I got quotes from so many vendors and Liberation Foods was by far the most affordable quote for the amount and quality of food offered (seemed to be French style cooking). The tasting we had with chef Dennis was great - all the appetizers, the steak and salmon, everything had was so tasty and presented well, and chef Dennis and the sous chefs and waitstaff who were present were such nice, good people, and they've been with him a long time, which says a lot. They have a rental company they work with and they brought all the linens, plates/flatware/glassware, so that was convenient and on the more affordable side too, so that was good. I was a little concerned that they were located so far away from my venue, but they were on time and it was not a problem after all. The main challenge was with communication. Dennis is the contact person and while he is a really nice guy, was inconsistent in how quickly he would return emails and/or answers to questions would be incomplete, needing multiple further clarifications. He was limited in his options for vegan mains, though he had an open attitude for the vegetarian/vegan/gluten-free item negotiations. If you are considering having Liberation Foods cater your event, I would recommend phone calls over emails (though emails are valuable to refer back to as a record for what was said...) and would just be prepared to be patient and persistent if you have specific questions you need answered. Overall, I wouldn't choose a different caterer because they really came through with good food that everyone enjoyed at a great price point, and with really great servers on the day of the wedding - I was so glad and grateful that it all worked out!

vent is perfect!!! Not only did they brave the worst snow storm in 30 years for our wedding, but they also ensured the event would be a success by bringing portable gear to work around the venue’s loss of propane, and making sure my husband and I got an opportunity to actually eat before and after the wedding ceremony. They brought small bites the whole time I was getting ready and even did lipstick checks to make sure it was smooth and none was on my teeth after eating! I would hire them to be my team of any event in the future without hesitation. Thank you, Liberation Foods!!!

We didn’t have such a great experience as many people rave about. We hired liberation foods for our Big Day based on the stunning reviews. Over the email, our communication was smo...

oth and easy. A week prior to the wedding I sent Dennis a dinner seating and a table set up and explained how many tables are needed on each side. This was a small wedding, 24 people including the couple so we didn’t have a coordinator. For this reason, I was very detailed as I wanted to make sure we don’t have to deal with technical issues during the wedding. When his staff started setting the tables, they were unaware of how many tables are needed. I had to pull up the excel table on my phone and walked them through it. The groom started helping them set the tables HIMSELF as they were just struggling to grasp an easy concept. I said the exact number of tables needed for each side, but they put more tables, so the groom had to remove them as it was very ugly to have empty tables! The table linens weren’t ironed. As the dinner started, they served a salad with dairy cheese to the groom who was vegan, and his diet was emphasized to Dennis during our communications. How hard was it to remember that the groom is vegan? The main dish: some guests had meat, some lobster tail. Everyone who I asked about the meat said it was cold. My brother-in-law said, “I wish there was a microwave.” The lobster tail was EXTREMELY salty and too spicy; my best friend who sat near me and I both ate it just because we had a long day and were very hungry. My ant wasn’t able to eat it. I didn’t ask every guest as I was very embarrassed. Also, they served a few plates at a time with a long interval in between, so some guests were already through the dinner while others had no food. One of his female staff members behaved inappropriately and flirted with my single friend then she started showing us the pictures of her dog all of a sudden. We had several cakes, one for us to cut and the other two to be served. They started serving a cake BEFORE cleaning the table from dirty plates and BEFORE we cut our cake! I was like what the heck?!? We were supposed to have coffee and tea service with the cake, but it was not provided. At this point, I was just too sick and tired of dealing with those people. Overall, it was a frustrating and upsetting experience. I felt like the groom and I had to spend more time communicating with the catering staff and fixing their errors than enjoying the evening with our guests. It felt like these people did not give a damn about providing good service. I am deeply confused by the high reviews of this company.

He explained his cuisine and set up a tasting for us. We knew he was the right person at our tasting because the food and presentation were fabulous. He kept in regular contact with us throughout the time. I remember adjusting food items and service a couple of weeks before the wedding. This was great because sometimes things change! He was accommodating and flexible. The meal was a grand slam with our guests. Everybody kept noting how tasty the food was. The Grilled Ribeye with Mushroom Sauce was heavenly. We decided to go with the elegant plating package turnkey and it was a great decision. Service was great and food even better.
