Not sure where to begin writing this review. There are truly no words big enough to describe how special Cello Joe was as our wedding DJ. He wasn’t just a part of our wedding day, ...

he made our wedding day. From the very first moment to the very last song, he gave us something so magical, so unforgettable, that it still makes us emotional to think about. He was literally the heartbeat of our day. He played live cello pre ceremony for all the guests to enjoy that was truly so beautiful. But the live cello as I walked down the aisle is a memory etched into our hearts forever. It was more than music. It felt like the soundtrack to our love story, and it was the most beautiful beginning to the rest of our lives. Then, during cocktail hour, he transformed the atmosphere with looping, beatboxing, and cello in a way that left every single guest completely captivated. People couldn’t stop talking about it, and even now, they’re still telling us it was the most unique and breathtaking performance they’ve ever experienced at a wedding from start to finish. And then there was the saxophonist he brought in during the dance party. pure magic. Together, they created an energy that was electric, soulful, and overflowing with joy. They didn’t just entertain, they touched every heart in the room. Not only was he the most talented cello musician, he absolutely crushed the dance party and played non stop for 3:30 hours. Not one bad song or bad mix. It was absolutely incredible. But what truly sets him apart is how much heart he pours into what he does. Without us even knowing, he recorded our entire ceremony, our cocktail hour, our dance floor, and gifted us not just music, but memories. He allowed us to relive the most important day of our lives again and again. That level of thoughtfulness is beyond anything we could have imagined. Our wedding was perfect because of him. He exceeded every expectation and gave us more than we ever dreamed possible. He is, without question, the most talented, kind, and extraordinary musician and DJ we have ever met. If we could give him more than 5 stars, we would. To us, he isn’t just the best wedding DJ in the world, he’s someone we will forever be grateful for, someone who gave us the gift of a wedding day that truly felt like a dream. Cello Joe, thank you for all the moments you created throughout our weekend. You truly are one of the most talented people we’ve ever met and I will be recommending you to everybody I know!!

From the very beginning, Joey was such a pleasure to work with. I had reached out to inquire about his services, unsure if we could make it work with our budget—but he was so kind ...

and understanding, and truly went above and beyond to help us find something that fit. Not only did he work with us on pricing, but he also offered audio engineering services, which was such a blessing since we hadn’t yet figured that part out. Joey was always easy to reach and wonderful to communicate with. Every time we had a question or needed to connect, he was there—responsive, thoughtful, and incredibly professional. And when the big day came… wow. Hearing him play as I walked down the aisle brought tears to my eyes. His cello music was absolutely beautiful—it added such a romantic, emotional layer to the ceremony, and truly brought my vision to life. It was a dream come true. We couldn’t have asked for a better musician to be part of our day. Joey’s talent, kindness, and willingness to go the extra mile made such a lasting impression. We’re so grateful and would recommend him a hundred times over.

aylists which guests enjoyed, impressed guests with live cello playing and looping, and was able to adjust for unexpected moments to have musical accompaniment which made the moments our guests were experiencing more magical. His DJing was professional and well timed to the energy of the crowd, and he knows his gear and equipment well. The fact that we had three different locations and need for wireless setups did not deter him, and he was prepared. Thanks Joey for taking care of all of our sound needs from ensuring voices were heard at the ceremony to closing out the night.

I recently had the pleasure of booking Cello Joe to perform at my wedding and what a special experience it was!!! Joey is a true professional on all levels! From start to finish, ...

communication was effortless and always on point. He even assisted us with setting up and dialing in the sound system. Now on to the important stuff... Cello Joe's performance bridged the spectrum of family and friends present for our wedding. It was such a magical experience seeing so many loved ones getting down to veggie maniac, bike girl and so much love :). Cello Joe delivered a performance that brought joy and smiles to everyone's experience. Overall I rate our experience 11/11. It was an honor to have such a talented musician perform and such a fun character to hang out with the rest of the event. Cello Joe's set was the musical highlight of our wedding. We're extraordinarily grateful that Cello Joe made the trip up to Portland and very much look forward to seeing this musical genius again in the near future!

Then onto the party- he absolutely crushed it. The transitions were amazing, he ebbed and flowed with the party and sprinkled in some surprise hits. Our guests all couldn’t stop raving. Just when we thought it couldn’t get better he added some live cello into the reception DJ playlist and everyone was floored. We will absolutely be using Joey again - best wedding DJ ever and we aren’t just saying that because it was our wedding!

nsure our day unfolded exactly as we envisioned. His creative ideas helped maintain a smooth and engaging atmosphere throughout the evening. Not only did he adeptly adjust the energy levels to suit the mood, but his skills as a cellist and his unique personality added an extra layer of charm. He even accommodated outfit changes between sets as requested! From entertaining the youngest guests to delighting the older relatives, he effortlessly catered to all ages. Our 18-month-old niece and 3-year-old nephew even held hands and danced to his music together! Despite initial doubts from our families about bringing in an artist we discovered at a music festival, they are now singing his praises. Cello Joe exceeded all expectations, from his classical cello performance during guest entrance to his cello covers during cocktail hour, and finally, his DJ/MC duties and original music at the after-party. If we could change one thing, it would be to have extended his captivating original set longer into the after-party—it was simply outstanding. Here's to Cello Joe for making our wedding unforgettable and gaining new fans along the way. No one else could have done it like him—truly perfect!

We got married on 10/08/2023 and booked Joey for both live entertainment and DJ. We selected him because he's a beatboxing cellist/DJ which we thought was totally awesome, and he d...

id not disappoint. He was incredible and so much fun to work with! Our vision was pretty quirky; our venue was a funky brewery in an old airplane hangar, our attire was Art Deco-style, we didn't want any tradition "wedding" music, and had a tasteful ode to Batman incorporated into our theme. Joey took our vision and ran with it. He had so many creative ideas and input throughout the whole planning process. Beginning with the ceremony, he played cello versions of non-traditional 80s, pop, and rock songs, which were beautifully interpreted and set the perfect mood for the perfect moment. During "Beer Hour", he shifted to playing the cello while beatboxing and singing to more non-traditional songs. I have to say we were not expecting him to sing, but were pleasantly surprised by his beautiful voice! We and our guests were thoroughly impressed by his talent and charisma. When we transitioned to the reception, Joey switched gears to DJ/MC mode. He and his wife who was assisting him were seriously the life of the party. We requested that our grand entrance song be the Batman Forever theme song, and he came up with a minute-long "movie trailer" intro for us. It was epic and hilarious, and the perfect way to set the tone for the entire evening. Throughout the night, he played both songs we requested as well as other songs that fit our vibe perfectly. We were on the dance floor all night (other than when my husband left when the Niners game started haha). He and his wife were also rocking out with us at the DJ booth. It's easy to see that Joey loves what he does. His passion for music and creativity shines, and we can't thank him enough for making our wedding day "the most fun wedding we've ever been to" according to every single one of our guests. It was the most amazing wedding ever and the best day of our lives. Thank you Joey!!!

a part of the wedding where there needed to be silence, the music just stopped. Cello Joe definitely played a part in making it all happen. Everybody LOVED the music, from my clos...

Plus now whenever I see Cello Joe's name as part of the line up at a festival or party, I get a little giddy thinking "Yup, he was at our wedding. We're cool like that." We had the option of having a DJ for an hour that played with Cello Joe, and that was really cool too. Basically, we had Cello Joe play by himself for the outside processional, and then him and the DJ play together during the first part of the reception. I can't recommend Cello Joe enough. Thanks for some wonderful music!

Joey played the cello at our Chinese wedding banquet and did a spectacular job! He played a mix of classics and pop covers, did both live performances and some DJ-ing. He wowed me ...

and my husband as well as all our guests. Additionally he set up the sound system, speakers, and mics - everything worked seamlessly. He was great at communicating and so easy to work with. We had to reschedule due to COVID (the week of!) and he was kind, incredibly understanding, and flexible when we were stressed out. He has both style and impeccable professionalism. Would recommend him and his original music as well in a heartbeat! He made our wedding so special and is an extraordinary talent.

Cello Joe was great to work with throughout the entire process--from coordinating prior to the event to setting up and performing on the day. I originally reached out to Cello Joe...

to have him entertain my party with his amazing cello skills, but ended up hiring him to DJ due to my restricted budget. When my schedule went a little awry, he graciously kept the party going past our agreed-upon time and even busted out his cello to elevate the atmosphere while asking nothing in return. When you hire Cello Joe, you not only get a professional entertainer, you also get a solid event-coordinating teammate. Do not hesitate to hire Cello Joe for your event.

Multitalented Musical Artist Joey Chang was instrumental in conducting our wedding ceremony and our wedding reception. He brought the highest level of musicianship, ceremony, and ...

professionalism to our special day, making it sing! Joey played classical cello music before our ceremony, for the processional, and during our ceremony. Each music piece was selected for its contribution to the orchestration of the whole nuptial service and brought out and accompanied the feeling of the moment. Joey also played both classical and contemporary live cello (many of his original pieces) at our reception during dinner, creating a warm, welcoming, and nuanced atmosphere. Additionally, offering his multitalented presence, Joey served as our master of ceremonies for the reception. His timing and transitions and delivery were as deft at the microphone as they were at the cello, never missing a beat. Not only that but he also served as DJ for our wedding reception dance party. Working with our established playlist, he brought out the playful and reflective moments of the night, providing music to accompany the entrance, the first dance, the father daughter and mother son dance, and the bouquet toss. He worked magic! Our wedding and its celebration were a work of art, and Joey Chang was a principal artist in its creation. Joey was reliable and dependable in all of our preparations every step along the way; not only was he punctual and prepared, he helped to adapt to the changes in the moment on our special day, capably and flexibly responding to the schedule as it evolved throughout the five and a half hour reception. Joey Chang is a multi talented musician and artist who brought style and poise as well as containment and sheer beauty to our wedding day with his presence at the cello, at the microphone, and at the DJ table.

t, he also DJs! He also has various equipment that you can rent for very reasonable fee - wireless mic, speakers, etc. Leading up to the event, he was great with the planning. His booking process was very organized and clear. He was flexible allowing us to submit any playlists and/or songs that we wanted and even familiarized himself with the songs beforehand. Our wedding day schedule was very complicated, but he did not miss a beat!! Because he was on top of the timing, our day was able to run smoothly and on time. He cued everything right on time and worked closely with our wedding coordinator to remain flexible throughout the day/night. His cello performance was... amazing. Our guest loved his set and were thoroughly entertained. His DJing was equally on par. He was able to read the crowd and kept them dancing all night. He accommodated song requests from our guests too. All in all, I could not be more grateful that we had him there on our special day. He made it magical and easy with his professionalism and talent. Highly recommended!!

autiful scene for the location we chose. During our cocktail hour he played more cello but also included some beat boxing and looping, which my guests raved about and thought was so unique. Sadly, as the bride I missed both of these, but when it came to his DJ skills I can attest that he had the party going all night. He listened to what we wanted and mixed up the playlist so that people were on the dance floor until the very end. He was extremely professional to work with and always listened to our wants. If you want an awesome DJ/cellist/beatboxer to make your wedding stand out and keep you guests talking then hire Joey!
