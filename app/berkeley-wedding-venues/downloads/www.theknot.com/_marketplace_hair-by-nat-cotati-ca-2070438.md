I couldn’t say more positive things about Natalie. She has exceptional talent. Not only did my hair as the bride look incredible, but so did all of my friend’s hair. We still talk ...

about our hairstyles from that day because we loved them so much. Natalie‘s braids are meticulous, tight, clean and hold up through hours of photographs, dinner and dancing. Natalie is also really easy to get along with. We all enjoyed talking with her as she did our hair on the wedding day. She nailed it on my hair trial run, which made me feel really confident and excited for my hair on my wedding day. You would be a lucky bride to have her be your hairstylist!

Natalie is a gem! She did my wedding hair exactly the way I was hoping, and it only took one trial run. She has an amazing eye for detail and is so patient with her clients to find...

the look that they are searching for. My elegant bun stayed in the entirety of my wedding and it never felt uncomfortable. Natalie also has the most gentle hand, and I literally almost fell asleep while she was doing my hair because it was so relaxing. 10/10 would recommend to anyone who is looking for a hair stylist that advocates for the look you want at your wedding and delivers incredible results! Love this girl!
