POINT! Highly recommend! DJ Mark listened to our needs, played our requested playlists, and even helped us stay on time and on script. Planning with this well-run organization was a breeze — invoicing was accurate, as negotiated, with easy payment and total trust in the system. The music and sound were exceptional--we had an outside wedding and I felt like the setup was intimate, but not overblown--exactly as we needed. HIGHLY recommend Elite Sound! I mean, DJ Mark even brought us brides a drink RIGHT when we needed it. Stand up company! Thank you!

d the DJ plays the entire song, and way too much bruno mars. We gave mark a spotify playlist of what we like (of MANY genres) and he completely listened to the vibe, and was actually mixing music. Some DJs also are a bit *too* impactful in terms of MCing, but Mark was clearly a professional and kept the events flowing without interrupting. I would hire Mark for our wedding again no question, and I am incredibly particular. He is 100% professional and I know went above and beyond to make our day special, without any involvement from us. If you need a wedding or event DJ, just hire Mark and be done with it!!

as involved in a lot of the planning process. Elite Sound was my first choice for all our music needs. I was thrilled that they agreed to make the trip. Choosing your DJ is one of the most important decisions you will make because they set the tone for the entire reception! It’s amazing how Mark can adjust the music to everyone’s personal style and still have everyone on the dance floor! I love that he is a clean cut classy guy and that is equipment just blends into the background. Mark really listens to the bride and groom. He blends their opinions and his expertise to create the reception of their dreams. Something that is festive and memorable for all their friends and family, even grandma. I give Elite Sound my highest recommendation for all your celebration needs.
