Samantha Hintz

Owner

Hello future brides and grooms! My name is Sammi Hintz, and I am the owner of Wishful Wedding. For the past eight years, I have had the joy of helping couples in Madison, Wisconsin and Austin, Texas plan their ceremonies, receptions, and all of the special wedding events in between. Ever since I first stepped off the plane in Tokyo in 2016, I have dreamed of making this incredible city my home. I have spent countless days exploring Tokyo, Yokohama, Kyoto, and Osaka, falling in love with the beauty, culture, and charm of each place. I was also fortunate to work alongside an extraordinary wedding planner in Japan, assisting with my first wedding in Kyoto. Through that experience, I gained a deep understanding of the unique challenges and nuances of planning a wedding in Japan—especially for couples coming from abroad. Because of this, I am confident in my ability to help you navigate cultural differences and bridge the gap between American and Japanese wedding styles, all while ensuring your celebration remains a true reflection of who you are as a couple. Combining my love for Japan with my passion for weddings, I would be truly honored to help you plan your perfect wedding here. My goal as your wedding planner is to work tirelessly behind the scenes so that you can enjoy a beautiful, stress-free day that not only meets but exceeds your expectations.♥ With Love, Sammi Hintz

Sammi is a complete planning rockstar in her ability to help us plan our dream wedding at the Four Seasons Hotel in Kyoto, Japan. There will never be any adequate words that reflec...

t her level of professionalism, flexibility and dedication to us during the entire process. We started planning our wedding two years in advance as we are from San Francisco, CA, and the Japanese language barrier and customs proved to be a challenge. With Sammi's help, we were able to blend both American and Japanese traditions effortlessly as her wealth of knowledge about the Japanese wedding industry and professional connections with vendors helped us tremendously achieve the dreamiest Kyoto wedding beyond our expectations. Sammi is an invaluable partner and we highly recommend her for all of your full service planning needs. She is well worth her weight by simply being available, an expert listener and is willing to learn and adapt, there is nothing she cannot do! Her ability to attune to our needs and wishes by being an expert communicator was absolute paramount in planning our special day. Sammi is a gem!

As one of the first couples in our friend's group to get married, we wanted to make sure we went with an experienced wedding coordinator for our big day. We booked with Wishful Wed...

dings, and we were very pleased with our choice. Sammi was wonderful to work with, as she gave helpful advice, was easy to reach, and reduced a lot of wedding stress. For example: \- When we first started wedding planning, we were overwhelmed by how many vendors were available per service we were seeking. We expressed this to Sammi, and she gave us a list of vendors she has previously worked with & had great professional relationships with. We ended up going with her suggested caterer, florist, DJ, and videographer - needless to say, great vendors seriously make a huge difference on the day of! We were so happy with their work, and Sammi did a great job with introductions & meetings. \- Planning sessions with her helped us make informed decisions that ultimately kept us within budget and saved us the hassle of committing to items that we didn't find necessary (welcome sign, flower petals on the aisle, charger plates, etc.). She also let us know what items were important, like having good bouquets since they'd show up in almost every photo. Her knowledge & experience definitely shined! \- Sammid did a great job of creating a timeline for when tasks/decisions should be completed. It was helpful to know that we didn't need to worry about the day-of schedule until the month of, when we should complete our vendor consultations, etc. Our big day was amazing, and we certainly have Sammi to thank for that! It goes to show that having the right people in your corner, especially for such an important event, can really make a difference.

Sammi was an incredible wedding planner. From introducing us to vendors to the execution of the whole event Sammi was there to help make our wedding perfect. While almost everythin...

g went according to plan when there was an error with a vendor Sammi stepped in and turned their SNAFU into one of the best aspects of our wedding. Sammi truly knows the Austin area. This knowledge helped us find some of the best options we did not know about for specific vendors, like a caterer that can pick up food from any restaurant. She helped us pick a venue that worked for our criteria, and she was there for every meeting to make sure all the right questions were asked, and our desires met. I think what we appreciate most about Sammi was her kind and honest approach to giving us a perfect wedding. After only a few meetings, Sammi knew when we were not completely happy with how a vendor meeting went and would immediately follow up with us to make sure we had exactly what we wanted. This thoughtful approach gave us the best and only wedding we’ll ever have, so we’re thrilled that we got the opportunity to work with her. We cannot recommend her more highly as a wedding planner.

highlights: FULL-SERVICE planned IN LESS THAN 4 MONTHS w/ invited guest count >300 for couple both working >70hrs/week. She helped make our DREAM WEDDING. She handled hiccups from ...

COVID SEAMLESSLY, without breaking a sweat. Sammi has become part of our family & we even had her included in wedding portraits. We LOVE her. My husband & I are super busy medical students and we had two options: Plan a wedding in less than 4 months so we could get married before we graduate, or wait 4 years until both of us finished residency. We are both the first in our families and of our friends to get married, so we didn’t know what we were doing. Our family is large (guest count >300 people) and we didn’t want to sacrifice a beautiful wedding with a strong presence of both cultures. I say all of this to explain the difficult situation we were in & ***how strongly I believe that WE WOULD HAVE POSTPONED OUR WEDDING until after residency (4 years later) IF WE DID NOT HAVE SAMMI. I interviewed about 5-6 wedding planners and all were very sweet, Sammi was the clear choice from the minute we met. There was a very clear change in our lives once Sammi came into the picture — everyone spoke of how calm, happy and excited we were during wedding planning, as opposed to how most couples inevitably are (very busy, stressed, etc.). My husband & I’s schedule is pretty rigorous (full of 70-80 hour work weeks, 14-hour night shifts, board exams). One of my FAVORITE things about Sammi was how understanding & flexible she was about our schedule. She was fine having all of our meetings at 8-9pm when we would get off of work, she wouldn’t let me apologize for forgetting to respond for several days because she understood the demands of graduate/professional school. She didn’t care if I responded to her texts at midnight/1am and if she was still up, she would help me out. I can’t express how much this meant to me. I’m a very frugal person and spending so much money on a wedding made me anxious, especially when I thought about paying more for a wedding planner. However, now that the wedding is done, I would have paid TWICE what Sammi charged with no hesitation. She and her services are worth 2-3x what she charges and I cannot believe how lucky we got with her. Sammi became so much more than a wedding planner or a friend — she became part of the family. I ended up inviting her to my bachelorette and bridal shower. My parents kept insisting we have her over for dinner. I invited Sammi to do cake tasting with me so we could hang out and have a little date. We even included her in our family portraits that the photographer took right after the ceremony. When people ask brides how they feel after the wedding, you’ll hear many say “The day went by so fast” and “I’m so glad the planning is over.” Because of Sammi, I got to enjoy all FOUR MONTHS (that’s it!!) of wedding planning and my husband & I got to soak in every, single second of our wedding day together. You only get married once (hopefully) and I vehemently believe that it would never have been this wonderful of an experience without Sammi. My husband and I love her and are determined to keep her in our lives, through friendship and by convincing all our friends/family to hire her, too. Your wedding planner is the most important vendor choice you will make. I am more than happy to be a reference for Sammi and will answer any questions truthfully as a recent client of hers.

Sammi was without a doubt one of the best vendors we had. It took some convincing of my husband that we needed a wedding coordinator, but even my husband told me that hiring Sammi ...

was the best decision we could have ever made. I was planning my wedding without any help from family, and she provided phenomenal insight as I thought through seating charts, layout, timeline, etc. She was always one step ahead, thinking of all the things and asking other vendors things I would have never thought of. Our wedding went seamlessly and that is truly due to Sammi. Even our guests commented to us how incredible and on top of everything Sammi was. My only regret is not hiring Sammi sooner!! We had a quick flip of venue that I was really nervous about, but she made it work and let me know what was feasible and what wasn’t. All of our vendors loved working with her, and she truly made the day stress free. I can’t even begin to imagine what the wedding would have been without her. Sammi is such a MVP and truly the best!!

Sammi is everything a woman could want in a wedding planner and I cannot thank her enough for everything she did for me. Our wedding was more amazing than I ever expected. She even got last minute decorations I forgot to get that I needed the day of the wedding. She is a wonderful wedding planner that I also consider a friend.

nd Sammi on the knot. When I reached out to her, she got back to me quickly, was up front with her very reasonable pricing, and she was so on top of everything. I was working nights and she flexed to my schedule for meeting times that worked for me. She coordinated everything with the vendors, she met with me and my mom and vendors as many times as she needed to in order to have everything set up. She handled the rehearsal and the wedding day flawlessly, and she even stayed to assist with clean up when we were having a hard time with it, even though we hadn’t paid her to do that service. When I went through wedding gifts, she left me a card and a gift card. All in all, Sammi was the best thing we invested money into for the entire wedding process. Thank you for everything Sammi!

Sammi was absolutely wonderful as our day-of coordinator! We are fortunate enough to be Sammi's first wedding in the Austin-area and she did such an incredible job. Sammi was very ...

responsive and met with us multiple times before the wedding to clarify details. We hired Sammi for her Stunning Silver package as we had most everything planned. She took care of ensuring the vendors knew where and when to show up at the day of the wedding, had a detailed and thoughtful timeline planned, and made the entire day stress free. If you need a day-of coordinator for your wedding I highly recommend hiring Sammi. Thank you again Sammi! Jordan & Jacian

order and made sure our wedding and reception went smoothly, allowing us to focus on having fun! The most valuable thing was her organizing and timing the whole day! There are so many moving parts on a wedding day and we could not have done it without Sammi's help. Not only did she time out the ceremony well, she also kept in touch with vendors the day of the ceremony, working everything out perfecly from when photos were to when flowers and special desert would be delivered. We didn't have to worry about anything! We highly recommend her services!

Sammi is AWESOME! Not only is she an excellent point of reference for all these things I know nothing about, but she's also creative and just an all-around pleasant person to work ...

with. We live out-of-state but wanted to get married back home. Sammi was our 'boots on the ground', and trust me, we sent those boots everywhere! My wife and I are planners, which sometimes makes it hard to work with others since we mostly know what we want; but not Sammi. She had a plethora of recommendations on hand, and if we still couldn't find the right vendor, she went out and found more. Sammi scheduled the interviews and guided us through choosing the best ones for us. She showed up in person to every meeting for us, and kept track of all of the bureaucratic (adult-stuff), so we were always on the same page. Sammi was always prepared with her own set of questions to ensure we had the answers to things we hadn’t thought about. She debriefed us each time and reassessed our priorities. At one point, when we were having difficulties getting in touch with Hair and Makeup Vendors, Sammi drove to their locations to speak face to face with them. If that's not enough, I want to point out that we got married right in the middle of COVID! We were literally planning 3 weddings at once since we were never sure of what was going to happen. Sammi never flinched and made sure our backup plans had backup plans. In the end, our day was wonderful. Everything went off perfectly and Sammi coordinated it all from behind the scenes. She was so great and we're incredibly grateful to have found her when we did. Planning a wedding is hard, but Sammi makes it much easier. Thank you so much, Sammi!

g. We knew generally how we wanted the wedding to look and approximately how many people we'd have, but Sammi really helped us get organized and find vendors to make our vision happen. Most of the vendors we ended up settling on were ones she recommended, and they all turned out amazing! The couple of vendors we used that she hadn't worked with before, she seemed to communicate with seamlessly, and she left us with very little to worry about. Throughout the entire planning process she gave us her honest opinions on vendors and helped us consider details that we never would’ve thought about without her. She was also super responsive to our emails and texts about anything wedding-related! On the day of the wedding, she had all of the decorations and vendors coordinated. She prepared schedules for every vendor and a separate one for us and other people in the wedding. We had a couple little hiccups come up the day of, but none of them were a big deal because Sammi had solutions immediately. We followed all of her suggestions on the schedule of events for the day (time of dinner, speeches, etc.) and we got so many compliments on how nicely everything flowed! We would definitely recommend Sammi to anyone looking for a wedding planner!

Sammi set-up pre-wedding meetings with us and came with us to see the venue ahead of time. She also ran the rehearsal and managed all the vendor coordination in the last couple weeks. The questions she had made us think through details we might otherwise have overlooked. It was also fun and reassuring that so many of our vendors had worked with her previously and were excited to work with her again! We kept hearing from our vendors "Your coordinator is Sammi? We love working with her!" Overall our experience with Sammi and Wishful Weddings was excellent! We would definitely recommend her to anyone looking for a wedding planner or day of coordinator!

d out and made us feel like she could make our special day come together. One of the things that we appreciated most, was her willingness to work with vendors that were gay friendly. In a market that is advertised toward straight couples, we wanted to be sure that our vision of love and family was kept at the forefront of any vendor we hired. We hired her for full service. My husband and I are not good with rejecting vendors and are both pretty bad procrastinators. Sammi was able to coordinate everything with vendors for us (as well as rejecting the ones we didn't want). She also made sure that we were making progress on things by sending friendly reminders and making time for meetings at our local coffee shop. She was available to us the entire week of our wedding and coordinated our rehearsal as well. We were so happy to have her there since we had no idea what we were doing. She was thoughtful about placement of people and timing so the photographer and videographer could capture everything of our wedding day. The biggest relief was having her there for our day of ceremony. Sammi created a minute by minute schedule for all of the vendors, as well as, the wedding party. Sammi and her assistant Felicia helped set up our entire venue while we were out getting ready and taking photos. She made everything run smoothly and kept the vendors on schedule so that my husband and I could enjoy our special day. It was honestly better than we could have ever imagined and Sammi is a huge reason for that. She is very kind and fun to work with. We would highly recommend getting Sammi if you ever have the opportunity. Thank you Sammi!
