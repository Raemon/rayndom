est-friendly, un-fussy, full of personality and, most important, upbeat and fun. We bought WDH's Day-Of package, which was an incredible value. WDH was the only coordinator with a package in our price range that included on-site services for all three events. If we had it to do over again, we wouldn't have it any other way. The other factor that set WDH/ Nicole apart from the others -- she understood and respected our budget (which was everything but lavish) and did not steer us toward higher-cost amenities even though they would have made her job easier. Thank you, Nicole. Job well done.

Nicole and Anna are wonderful, experienced professionals! We contacted Wedding Day Hostess for day-of-coordination and they really executed! I could not have imagined managing the ...

last couple months of wedding planning without them. They scheduled regular check ins with us and managed the timeline, seating chart, amenities etc. While the planning process was flawless, I need to give huge kudos to Anna (our onsite day of coordinator) for managing our rehearsal and wedding day flawlessly. The weather didn’t work out quite as we had hoped. It poured during our rehearsal, so we had to practice indoors (back up plan) and for the brief moment it stopped raining, we were able to sneak in a couple of practices outside. On our wedding day, the chance of rain was minimal, so we were hoping to keep the ceremony outdoors, but it stormed right when our ceremony was about to start! Anna and the venue staff quickly pivoted by moving all of the chairs and our guests indoors to stay out of the rain. She kept our guests happy and kept the rest of the evening moving flawlessly. I couldn’t recommend Wedding Day Hostess enough. For one of the most important events/days in your life - you will not regret hiring them to help bring your wedding vision to life.

amless. I did not have a thought about anything the month of my wedding because they really do take care of it all. Talking to vendors, coordinating with quick phone call check ins and reminders. I had a really rough experience with a previous day of coordinator and Nicole and Anna quite literally saved the day, leading up to the big day. They were so on top of everything and asked questions that I wouldn’t have thought of. They were so helpful with layout and interior designs, color schemes and the overall flow of the reception. I didn’t have to think about anything but enjoying my time with my husband on the day of my wedding. When we walked into our reception, the thought that Anna put into the design and the style of all the personal decor-was magnificent. Anna is a stellar day of coordinator and I would get married OVER AND OVER to have Anna and Nicole again. You will never regret hiring this team 🩷 they are pure peace and comfort which is what a bride really needs!!!!!!!

We hired a day-of coordinator through Wedding Day Hostess, and we would highly recommend them! We worked primarily with Nicole on the coordination and logistics side, and Anna was ...

our actual coordinator on site. They also added an additional day-of coordinator, Amy, to help at no extra charge. Nicole was very thorough, and is an excellent asset to have especially if you reach that decision fatigue point in your planning and need help making decisive and well-informed choices on things. Anna and Amy did a great job day-of as well. They struck the perfect balance of keeping everything running smoothly while letting us be free to enjoy ourselves. I only wish that we had brought them on board sooner - we were a little late in hiring them, and I think having them on board earlier rather than later would have made things a bit easier. Overall, we had a great experience!

ything run smoothly, and took so much stress off my shoulders. She was always there for me and able to handle things quickly and professionally. While I knew deep down we needed a day of coordinator and that it would be helpful, when we were looking at costs we started debating "is it worth it, and do we really need it". Let me tell you...IT IS WORTH IT!!! I could not have had a stress free, enjoyable day without Anna and Wedding Day Hostess. After putting so much time, planning, and effort into the wedding day, it would have been awful to not enjoy it fully by having to coordinate on the day of, worry about things not going right, or organize vendors, etc. Anna took care of all these things, and I could just be the bride. We are so grateful for what they did for us on our special day.

Valerie and Nicole (sisters) were essential for our day-of-coordination! We got married in San Francisco at the Conservatory of Flowers on April 15, 2023. Nicole was busy for the d...

ay-of, but kept us on track with a wonderful spreadsheet, and helped us check over vendor logistics and contact information ahead of time. On the day-of, Valerie did a great job corresponding with vendors and making sure our amenities and decor looked beautiful. When we gave her the instructions to "do with the extra flowers/greenery runners as you see fit", Valerie did an excellent job and exceeded all our expectations! I think the only regret for me is not leaning on Valerie a bit more for herding our groomsmen and bridesmaids for some photos and smaller tasks, given how capable she was. Their pricing was also very reasonable. I'd highly recommend them for your wedding as well!

felt like anything could go off the rails - to the point where we didn't have to worry about a thing from the rehearsal onward. A couple phone calls and a walkthrough were all it took, and they handled everything behind the scenes, confirming deliveries, running the setup, even managing the entire show from the start of the wedding through the reception. They helped us enjoy our wedding day with no unneeded stress. Nicole and co are professional, low-maintenance, no-nonsense, and overall GOOD at what they do. They offer a really good value in an industry that's full of markups, too. Highly recommended.

ss. About 3-4 months into the planning process, I had a moment of panic realizing I needed a 2nd set of hands that wasn't a bridesmaid or family member to help me during the wedding day. I was THAT bride that thought I could do it all my own, but was I wrong! I do not regret hiring Nicole as she did everything and MORE! I search high and low for the best wedding planner and found Nicole through The Knot at like 1:00 in the morning one night - she probably thought I was crazy! We chatted on the phone for an hour before she sent over the contract and from that one phone call, I knew I had found the person that would be my right hand woman for the day! In the month leading up to the wedding, her and I talked on the phone weekly; going over the timeline, vendors, decor details and anything wedding related. The week prior to the wedding we had our last phone call and I never felt more relieved and relaxed than I did in that moment - I knew Nicole and Val were going to make our wedding day one of a kind! The day of the wedding came and Nicole and Val went to work - setting up all of our decor at the ceremony and reception and all though I didn't see most of it until I got the pictures back - it was absolutely beautiful! I trusted her judgement to execute my idea of how everything should be, and she did - 100%! She kept my husband/I - and all of our vendors on track with the timeline and made sure we ate!! :) Nicole is by definition, SuperWoman and you need her for your wedding! Our day would not of been the same without Nicole and Val and for sure, my stress levels would of been much higher without her. Our wedding was beautiful because of Nicole and I am so happy she was apart of our special day! Thank you Nicole!

planning on track and pointed out several things that we wouldn't have thought of until much later. She knows her stuff. We had a series of weekly phonescalls and a couple of in-person meetings including at the venue about a month before the event to help us envision the layout and iron all the weird ideas my wife and I had into a realistic timeline. She also offered to be present during the rehearsal, but we did not have one. On the day-of she and her assistant did a great job coordinating with the vendors, venue and deliveries and helping to direct set-up (for example she noticed we had missed placing a few settings at some long tables). We gave her tips to distribute and generally left everything in her hands. The event went off perfectly, everything occurred right on schedule and everyone had a blast. The one "hiccup" of the day was some family showing up who hadn't RSVP'd. We asked Nicole to "deal with it" and she rearranged the seating plan to accommodate before dinner started. Overall, my wife and I got to focus on having a great time with our guests on our wedding day.

Nicole was an incredible day-of coordinator. We planned our wedding ourselves - as in, we booked the vendors - but she was instrumental in making everything actually happen. We had...

a weekly call with her in the month leading up to the wedding, and in our first call, she asked us maybe 30 questions about the day of, and we had answers to maybe two of them. That made it clear how much we needed her! Nicole is the voice you never knew you needed to coordinate your wedding and keep everything on track. On the day of, I realized a couple of things had been left not done at the venue (which we set up ourselves the day before), and I called her, panicking a little, only to hear she was already completing the setup I had neglected! She also made our wedding look incredible, noting every last detail we wanted put in place and making it happen, greeting and assigning tasks to vendors, and making everything else happen throughout the day. She’s the day-of person you HAVE to have.

Nicole and her sister Valerie were immensely helpful in the month of my wedding. The venue owner for my wedding turned out to be very rigid in what she would and would not allow br...

ides/grooms to do. For example, we had a 15 minute, unresolved argument over whether we should have to stand up next to the speech givers, or if we could sit at our table. Another example was whether or not we could have an announced entrance to our guests as husband and wife at dinner (a "new trend" according to our venue owner). Nicole and Valerie were helpful in making sure my voice was heard when I had difficulty speaking up for what I wanted in a way that wasn't aggressive or disrespectful to the venue owner or any other vendors. I would definitely recommend them for a month-of or day-of service if you think you might need similar help! In general I think their angle is more to plan fabulous events so my need didn't tap their full potential, but I was really grateful to have a wedding professional on deck the day of the wedding to make sure things were all happening as they should be.

We couldn’t be happier with our working experience with Wedding Day Hostess. No hitches except for the most important one (my new husband and I getting hitched)!

zing at getting us thinking about the little details of our wedding day - things that had never even crossed our minds - and checked in with us along the way. She got all our vendors organized in the weeks leading up to our wedding and by the time our rehearsal dinner came around, we were able to completely hand over our responsibilities and enjoy our special day! Our wedding day was perfect and we owe that to Nicole. She kept us on schedule, something that we would never have been able to do with all the craziness of the wedding, and made sure that every detail we had imagined for our day was executed. We highly recommend Wedding Day Hostess!

Nicole was incredibly organized and helped share planning resources that helped guide my own personal planning for the big day. I hired the Wedding Day Hostess for "Day of Coordina...

ting" since I wanted to plan the majority of the details for my wedding. But Nicole was involved throughout the entire process to meet in person, talk on the phone, or email ideas back and forth. My wedding had two location and there was a coordinator that worked at the church so Nicole's team only needed to help support with the reception location. With her attention to detail and logistics I knew that I could show up after the ceremony and that she would have everything running smoothly. In the end I wish I could have used her for the entire day because she and her team were so helpful!

s the best decision I made to make our wedding beautiful and run smoothly. Nicole provided suggestions and took a hands on approach with different online tools to streamline our wedding timeline. She communicated with me every day, multiple times a day if need be leading up to our wedding. I truly believe our wedding ran as smoothly as it did because of her. I can say nothing but amazing things about her and will be recommending her to all our friends!

We had everything planned for our wedding except for one main thing. Who would be there from 8 a.m. on to receive the furniture, then the wine, then the cake, then the fruit, then...

the food and let everyone know where to put it all? Then, who would guide the guests to their seats, guide them from the ceremony to the reception, and who would cut the cake, refill the water pitchers, clean up, and finally pack up everything at the end? Online I found "Wedding Day Hostess" -- exactly what we needed! Nicole and her helpers took care to make sure everything ran smoothly the day of our wedding. Her help was essential to making everything fit into the timeframe. In planning ahead, she also suggested we hire additional help, since she and her helpers don't cut or move cake and also because we would need more people to set up, serve and clean up. That was good advice. The entire day was wonderful and worry-free, thanks to Nicole!

I can't say enough great things about Nicole and Vanessa! We hired them to be our "day-of" coordinators, as I had a lot of planning and coordinating leading up to the event that I ...

wanted to do myself. I knew that I needed some help on our actual day. We first met with Nicole in-person a couple of months before the wedding, so that we could talk about our plans and how we wanted our day to be carried out. She was super easy-going, kind and personable, and asked lots of great questions. During the weeks that led up to our wedding day, we kept a shared google doc, updating as we went along. She is very organized and kept me on schedule! On the day of our event, her colleague Vanessa came on-board with her and the two of them executed an amazing wedding event! I had nothing to worry about and felt like I could trust them with everything. They sure delivered!! BEST DAY EVER! My husband and I were not the only ones who were impressed by the day....we had several guests tell us later how our wedding was really special and one of the best they had ever been to. Their price was SUPER reasonable as well, which was a big concern of ours, as my husband and I were paying for the whole wedding ourselves. I would recommend Wedding Day Hostess to everyone I know!

Nicole was an absolutely wonderful wedding planner! I was introduced to her through a good friend, and from the moment I met her I knew she would be the right person for the job. I...

had a clear vision of exactly what I wanted my wedding to look like, and Nicole worked extremely hard to make that vision come to life on my wedding day. She was incredibly detailed, providing me with weekly and monthly to-do lists, along with month by month checklists of exactly what needs to happen as we plan for the big day. She kept tabs on all of my vendor my payments, followed up with vendors and was in very close communication with me. Nicole ensured we connected at least once a week, and during the months leading up to the wedding almost everyday. Sometimes we would email or speak on the phone more than 5 times a day! I felt comfortable knowing Nicole was so hands-on, taking charge and managing the process behind the scenes so I could continue with my full-time job stress-free. She made the process seamless, easy and fun. One of the things I found most impressive about Nicole, were the layouts and floor plans she made, tweaked and finalized for every single room in the wedding. Wow, they were detailed and just amazing down to every single linen and candle placement!! She was timely in sharing these with all of the vendors and making sure everyone was clear on the setups, layouts and transitions in the different rooms. On the wedding day, everything ran perfectly according to the timeline she worked so hard on - I received so many compliments from my guests as to how well the wedding ran and what a great job she had done. I would recommend Nicole to anyone looking for a hands-on wedding planner who loves what she does and takes her work seriously.

ways on-time responding to my e-mail and questions. I did not have to worry about anything on the day of my wedding. Nicole and her team took care of everything and I could have not asked for more! They were very helpful, professional, prompt and NICE. They knew what they were doing, followed our timeline and handled everything on my wedding very well. I am already recommending her to my friends who are getting married this year.. If you need someone to coordinate your wedding for you, Nicole and her team are the right people to do it! I will always be thankful to them because of them my wedding turned out really fun, organized and unforgettable!

Where do I start?! Nicole and her team made my special day such a joy! Nicole was great from our first meeting to the wedding day, she has a way about her that makes you trust her ...

instantly and that is not easy being that this is one of the most important day in a couples relationship. Nicole was very responsive to emails and made sure that all my questions were answered. What I really like about Nicole is that she is truly about making you feel comfortable an is willing to go the extra mile without charging you for every step she takes. Some planners I met with before Nicole were nickel and dime-ing me if they blinked too many times. Nicole understands the process of making a wedding day special. I would absolutely recommend Nicole to any bride that is searching for the PERFECT day of coordinator, someone to make sure that all your hard work pays off. Nicole is not overbearing and makes subtle suggestions, which are always on point. When I walked into the venue, honestly, everything was better than I could have imagined. The stellar service did not stop there, Nicole and her team were attentive to my new husband and myself. Always asking if we were doing fine or if they could get us anything. In addition, Nicole and her team stick to the timeline that you provide- everything went off without a hitch. Bottom line, if you want a stress-free day that you can actually enjoy... Wedding Day hostess is the way to go!

way. I had finally hit the realization that despite any amount of careful planning on my part - I needed someone else to ensure it all happened. From the first 5 minutes of our first meeting to the morning after our wedding I couldnt have been more relieved that I had Nicole and her team to help. She offered amazing advice and thought of all the details I hadn't. Those last few weeks are hectic enough without taking it all on as your own, having an ear, a sounding board, and someone to help you rest that it will all turn out is essential. When it came to the big day it was priceless to have another person who knew the event as well as I did so that we could enjoy the moments. Anytime we needed something to happen that day it did. I can't emphasize enough how great it was to have them.
