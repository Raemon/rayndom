From the very first tasting to the final bite on the wedding day, our caterer delivered an experience that was nothing short of magical. They didn’t just serve food—they crafted a ...

feast that was better than we could imagine, especially for the amount of guest we had. It told a story and brought our guests together in the most delicious way imaginable. Every dish was a masterpiece. From the melt-in-your-mouth hors d'oeuvres (prawn & bacon - a must have) to the perfect buffet, the flavors were bold, balanced, and beautifully presented. Guests are still raving about the tender steak, delish mac & cheese, and veggie lasagna!!! That was incredible. The veggies were perfectly cooked and mashed potatoes were so yummy! And, everything was hot! I am not kidding when I say our guests commented on the food days and weeks after the wedding. 👨‍🍳 The Team: Professional, warm, and incredibly attentive. They anticipated every need, accommodated last-minute changes with grace, and made sure every guest felt cared for. Their service was seamless—like a well-choreographed dance behind the scenes. 🎉 The Experience: They didn’t just cater our daughter and son-in-law's wedding—they elevated it. The presentation was stunning, the timing impeccable, and the atmosphere they helped create was unforgettable. Robert was so kind as to help with protecting the sun for our bartenders which were separate vendors. Everyone was so kind. I am sure there was more that went on behind the scenes that we don’t know about, but everything was perfect. If you're looking for a caterer who will treat your event like a work of art, look no further. They helped make our daughter and son-in-law’s wedding the best day and we are very grateful.

Wilma Lott Catering truly surprised us! We got so many compliments on our food, with many people going back for seconds at the buffet, which we did not expect from ‘wedding food’. ...

We were planning the wedding long distance so did not get a chance to meet the staff in person or do a tasting, so it was based on their reviews and relationship with the venue and our coordinator that we just trusted it would work out. We didn’t want the stereotypical fare and limited vegetarian options so went with a Thai inspired menu that they were able to pull from other recipes. We also did some add on desserts which were very popular. The package and pricing per person was incredibly budget friendly and included water service and a beverage table for tea/coffee/lemonade.

ir services due to having our wedding in 2020, but they arranged wonderful to go boxes that we got to enjoy. Kerri is wonderful to work with and we seriously felt so lucky that we chose them as our caterer. We couldn't have asked for better service or food. They made our day feel less chaotic and more like a wedding and we're so thankful for them.

We originally were going to go with Kinder's to cater the wedding. But, we wanted to do family style and we were worried about the efficiency of the staff serving all the tables so...

we decided to look elsewhere. We first went in to do the tasting which was soooooo good we were all hooked right away! They have such a great selection and we picked very simple BBQ style foods and they tasted gourmet. It was delicious :) I got so many compliments after the wedding about the food, also. The appetizers were amazing with a very professional staff. It was overall just a great experience with Wilma Lott Catering!

I used Wilma Lott to cater my wedding with of 66 people. We had three different buffet stations and 5 passed appetizers. I heard from all my guests that the food was great and ther...

e was so much! This company was easy to work with, they responded to emails and phone calls. They helped with rentals of tables, chairs, glassware and linens. The servers were delightful and friendly. They made sure that my husband and I both were able to taste the food! We were taking pictures during the cocktail hour and when we rejoined the group a server brought me a plate of the appetizers to taste! I heard from many guests how much they liked the servers. We also had sooo much food left over (after feeding all the guests, my vendors, and themselves!) we had enough food to feed people at a brunch the next day, the food was great. They also had these lovely fruit carvings at the stations. I would use them again in a heartbeat! A great family company: excellent food and service for a great price!

I will use these guys any day. They had excellent staff and they really delivered on the day of. Everyone liked their food and they were very helpful. Very reasonably priced too!

The whole crew at Wilma Lott was fantastic. We did an appetizer party for 80. All of the food was outstanding. Our party guests raved about it. But in addition to the food, the ...

staff really went above and beyond. We held our event at our house and we used our own plates and silver ware, they washed and dried everything and had it neatly stacked. My kitchen was spotless. You would have never known we had a party for 80 people. Their prices were very good. They were well under the others we contacted. One more thing- we had our own cake and Wilma Lott did not charge to plate and serve it. I don't think we found any other caterer that didn't charge to plate the cake. Something to keep in mind when you are shopping around for a caterer for your wedding.

aken care of. Any idea I had, they were on it and willing to help. I also want to thank all of the staff that helped at the wedding. They were so kind and seemed as excited to be there as our guests were! It would be impossible to detail every little thing I liked about working with this company, so just know overall that you will not be disappointed with anything, I highly recommend them for weddings or any event! We did a four station buffet, each station had different types of cuisines, example, Italian, Asian, etc. Weeks after our wedding I still have people calling and emailing me about the food! It was amazing! I have never had such good food at a wedding before, I am just glad it was my wedding! Afterwards the staff bagged up all our leftover food and froze it for us. After the honeymoon we had tons of great food to come home to! Wedding day was the best day ever and I owe much of that to Wilma Lott!
