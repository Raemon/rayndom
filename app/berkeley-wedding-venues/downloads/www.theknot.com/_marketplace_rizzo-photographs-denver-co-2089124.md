Expectations were clear, and the quality of her work exceeded them. Chantalle’s dedication to making her clients happy and enjoying the journey is unmatched. Highly recommend her for any occasion—weddings, boudoir, and more!

If you’re even thinking about booking this photographer—stop thinking and just DO IT. She has an incredible, jaw-dropping style and an eye for the kind of moments most people don’t...

even realize are happening. Every shot feels intentional, elevated, and effortlessly stunning. What truly sets her apart is how she makes you feel. She has this rare magic that instantly puts you at ease—like you’re the most confident version of yourself. You feel comfortable in your own skin, fully present, and somehow she captures that energy perfectly. Nothing feels forced, nothing feels awkward—just real, beautiful moments that somehow look editorial-level amazing. Her energy? Unmatched. Fun, calming, hype-girl, and professional all wrapped into one. She doesn’t just take photos—she captures the feeling of the day, the emotion, the joy, and somehow gives you more than you ever imagined you wanted. If you want photos that make you relive your wedding day every single time you look at them, this is your photographer. Book her before everyone else does—you’ll thank yourself forever. ✨📸

y. Chantalle is both an incredible photographer and has the perfect personality for your wedding day. She was there to hype me up when I needed that, to hold my hand when I needed support, to help me feel calm and present. She was able to capture intimate moments without it feeling invasive, and was able to give direction during posed photos to make them all look like magazine ready shots. She was such a joy to work with and I’m so grateful for the photos she got. I would highly recommend hiring her if you want your wedding day to be enhanced (not just captured) by your photographer
