A winter Wedgewood wedding at Boulder Ridge was one of the best choices my now husband and I made. The weather was perfect with its sunshine and temperatures that could make a pers...

on want to stay outside for hours (until the sun set). From the beginning, the Wedgewood planning/sales team were just fantastic to work with. They were kind and patient as we learned the wedding planning process. Wedgewood weddings in general made planning direct and easy with their packages! Our main coordinator, Kelli was someone we trusted our lives with and she did not miss a beat! She understood the assignment and ensured that we had a stress free wedding full of laughs! Our banquet captain, Emily was such a treat. Though we only met for the weekend, we we knew were in good hands when it was her time to run the show. She went above and beyond when I lost a very sentimentally valued earring for more than 12 hours from the wedding into the next day. She and the awesome chef, Alejandro hunted that thing down! Chef Alejandro made the smartest idea of checking the vacuum and they found it! Another person who helped calm the storm of wedding day stress was Nicole. She made sure to grab us drinks and eat during gaps to ensure we were fed! She also became an impromptu camera light pole holder! Boulder Ridge without a doubt left a positive impression on us as well as our wedding guests. 10/10 would recommend to others about this place with their service, conveniently beautiful location, and the overall price. So much recommendation that a friend is going to tour the property possibly for her own wedding!

Oh my goodness, where to begin! Boulder Ridge by Wedgewood Weddings was a dream come true!! My husband and I had a shorter (6-month) engagement, and right when we walked into our ...

tour at Boulder Ridge we knew it was the spot for us, and felt instantly taken care of. The organization and friendly care that the staff gave us made wedding planning manageable and FUN! Shoutout to Melissa - her friendly and confident demeanor was what sealed the deal for us to sign with Boulder Ridge for our big day. Their technology and wedding planning communication is easy to use, and helped us check off tasks efficiently. I have countless good things to say about the wedding day-of. Kelli was our on-site coordinator and she did a fabulous job organizing all of our friends and family to have an organized and beautiful ceremony. I got unexpectedly very sick on the wedding day, and was sick throughout the first look all the way until our dance floor. Kelli was incredible and rose to the occasion, staying by my side caring for me so graciously, while directing traffic with our banquet caption to ensure the evening went off as smoothly as possible given the situation. They did an incredible job flipping our cocktail hour and ceremony times to give me time to feel well enough for the ceremony, so smoothly that none of our guests were even aware of the change! I 100% recommend Wedgewood Weddings, the Boulder Ridge location and team are all top-notch professional, elegant, and beautiful :)

My husband and I could not have been more pleased with the staff at Boulder ridge. From the beginning of the planning process they were on top of everything. Since my husband and I...

are not local to San Jose, we were really stressed about wedding planning, but the Boulder Ridge team helped us through the processes seamlessly. Their wedding planning program is a well-oiled machine, and I highly recommend it for couples like us who need more support in the planning process! (all of their vendors are already so wonderful!) The day of could not have been more perfect. I want to specifically call out our coordinator Kelli and banquet captain Emily. They were absolutely amazing on the wedding day. Throughout the night, they always made sure we were taken care of, often popping by with drinks/food/desserts to make sure we didn’t miss out on eating and hydrating. Even our guests were impressed with their service, many remarked on how happy they were to see us eating so much (which sadly doesn’t seem to happen for couples on their wedding day!) Shout out also to Melissa who helped us throughout the planning process. She was super attentive to our needs early on and responded so quickly to all our inquiries! Go with Boulder ridge if you want easy access to top notch vendors, a less stressful wedding planning process, and just the opportunity to work with a really kind and wonderful team of people.

I had the most amazing experience with Wedgewood Weddings and really did have the best day ever! From our wonderful and helpful planner Melissa! She help make my vision into realit...

y with her can do positive attitude. Every step of the way she was my biggest cheerleader and knew all of it would come together! I could of planned my wedding without her and can't thank her enough for making my wedding day a memory of a life time. All my guest kept saying how amazing it look such a beautiful place and how great the food and drinks were! My family and friends can be so pick but they were really wowed! Thank you to the chefs! My banquet captain Emily was so sweet and help pack up all our things. She even brought me my slippers when my feet were hurting without even me asking. She just went above and beyond and all with a smile. She really help make the end of the night seamless. So thankful to have her as my banquet captain. Kelli was the best coordinator ever! I truly felt like royalty with her helping me the entire day. She help carry my dress, held my boquet, held my drink and made sure to give me and my now husband appetizers in between breaks. She was the one who hyped me up and continuously check on me and brought me what I needed without asking. I was feeling overwhelmed as wedding do that for the bride but she kept me in high spirits and keeping me going all day long. She felt like she was not just my coordinator but my friend. 100 out of 10 I would recommend Kelli, Melissa, and Emily to be your planner, coordinator and banquet captain I had the dream team and will always remember them for make my wedding day feel like the royal wedding. thank you to all the wonderful vendors! my florist was amazing and my flower and decor were beautiful! My cake was breathtaking and had so much fun tasting all the flavors so many good ones to choose from! My DJ and MC went above and beyond in every way. CCE is the place to get your magic wow moment on the dance floor and were the most amazing host. They took my wedding to a whole other level! My photographers were with API and they were the sweetest! Connor and Andy were fantastic! My photos came out beautiful even capture the moments I didn't think I would ever get to see. pro prep event had all my beautiful decor and made my wedding feel like a Million dollar wedding. All vendors were 100/10 and made it so easy to plan! All staff on the wedding day was friendly and kind! From the photo booth staying open late so I could get a final picture of me and my 3 best friends in I'm forever greatful. This was so important because I'm the last of the 3 of us to get married and we all took photos at the photo booth at each others wedding. I thought I was too late to get a picture but my coordinator told then to open again so I could get that last picture. It now hangs on my wall with all 3 wedding and completes the 3 best friend wedding circle I will one day show my kids. Thank You! Wedgwood know weddings and know how important those little moments make a difference and memories. I would recommend everyone to get married at a Wedgewood! Most affordable but also most magical venues to choose from. Boulder Ridge was everything and more went above our expectations. Everyone should get married at a Wedgewood! My day was so smooth that I could enjoy every moment of getting married. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!

issa did an amazing job helping us iron out all of the final details. The day of the wedding, Melissa, Tiffany and Emily took really good care of us. They were super attentive and on top of everything. I dropped off a bunch of decor for them to setup, so I was super grateful that they were able to take care of those things for me. The food was very good, and our guests complimented the bar staff as well. We loved the wedding cake (we used I Do Wedding Cakes through them), and our DJ (Ryan from La Place Productions). I'm glad we booked an all inclusive venue since they took care of so much. I did have an outside vendor for some of our rentals and they took care of managing the drop off/pick for that, so it was super helpful. Once again, I want to shout out our Banquet Captain, Emily. She was so kind, and on top of things. Ending our night with her was perfect.

This is an absolutely beautiful venue for a wedding. The average experience was nice, but I really felt there were things lacking day of. Overall communication was poor throughout ...

the planning and day of. Pros: \- Beautiful \- Customizable options \- Inclusive package \- Food is good \- Bakery was good. IdoWeddingCakes \- DJ was great and really helped the day. Brian Laplace Cons: \- the shuttle service for guest from parking lot to venue was horrible. Guest were waiting in line for one golf cart to take 3 people at a time, very disappointed and affected guests experience. \- florist was not the easiest to work with. Flowers were wilting and browning when received and the incorrect boutonnieres were used. FlowerDivas \- the venue was late to set up, dance floor, tables and chairs, sweetheart backdrop was all being set up when bride and groom got to the venue. A lot seemed to be left behind from the wedding the day before. Silverware wasn't even placed on every place setting and guests had to ask for it. \- the security guard was walking through the reception area, very unprofessional and unnecessary \- the cake service was extremely slow and caused guest to miss out. Very disappointed \- along with slow set up several of the details we went over multiple times with the venue we're not followed through on day of. Just felt sloppy and lack of care. Overall it was a beautiful venue, but just felt slighted by day of details and follow through, especially for the price you pay for your special day here.

We are so glad that we had our wedding at Boulder Ridge and truly wouldn’t have had it any other way! The team was so friendly and helpful from the beginning — I particularly want ...

to shout-out Melissa who was with us from start to finish and made us feel so at ease and supported with her enthusiasm and expertise. The fact that this venue is pretty much all-inclusive with a great team of vendors that they work with was a huge reason we went with Wedgewood. We loved being able to pick from an extensive and impressive menu of food and drinks. (We received so many compliments on the food in particular; several friends said that ours was the best wedding food they’d ever had!) It was also so easy to work with our baker, florist, and DJ. They also offered plenty of options to make the decor and wedding timeline personal to us. Plus, Boulder Ridge in particular has lovely staff, a gorgeous view, and the ceremony and reception space were just what we were looking for: spacious while still being intimate for our guest count of just under 100, and fitting with our more modern yet rustic theme. We met with the team several times leading up to our wedding and the entire process was so straightforward and helpful in keeping our wedding stress and anxiety at bay. It was probably the easiest and smoothest planning process we could have asked for! I would highly recommend having your wedding at Boulder Ridge. You’ll be in good hands and have a truly memorable and beautiful day! Thank you to the team for making one of the best days of our lives come together so perfectly.

sier. First of all, this place is gorgeous! We got so many compliments on how nice this venue was. It's at the top of a hill at a private golf course and overlooking the valley in San Jose. We had the Elite package, and they took care of almost everything from the catering, tables/chairs, open bar, DJ, Cake, Floral Centerpieces, Photobooth, and even a day of onsite coordinator! If I had any questions, I could just text it to them and they got back to me same day most of the time! Our guests loved the food and the whole experience! Don't worry about it being cookie-cutter either... there are plenty of ways to customize your big day to make it your own. If you are looking for the wedding of your dreams, I highly recommend Bould Ridge!

Our Wedgewood bartender had a medical emergency during the wedding and our guests had to perform CPR on the ceremony lawn... Our coordinator mentioned afterward that the bartender ...

was feeling ill earlier in the day, which makes me wonder why they would let her carry on for the rest of the day -- especially during this time and age when covid is still a serious concern. There's a lack of sympathy for their employees and a lack of concern for their guests. Several of our guests were doctors and nurses who were pretty shaken up after the event as they all assumed the bartender passed away after 15-30 minutes without a pulse. The ambulance was called, but took a long time to get there, indicating that there was not a great emergency plan in place (if at all). Keep this in mind if you are planning on having older guests in attendance that are susceptible to medical issues as they may not receive the help they need in time. I'm only writing this review because Wedgewood still has not acknowledged the issues we raised through the survey they provided at the end of the event. The two stars are for the beautiful venue, good food, and excellent coordination. Not sure if anyone is willing it all just for that though...

All the staff at Boulder Ridge were so easy to work with. We had a budget that they helped us meet while still having the wedding of our dreams. The best part is that it is an all inclusive venue. They take care of decorations, food, photo booth, DJ, and provide a day of coordinator. All we had to do is show up. Took a weight off of our shoulders. I especially have to give a shoutout to Heather and Melody, who were so amazing and friendly and made our life so much easier. They made sure that everything went smoothly the day of our wedding. And it went off without a glitch. We all had a blast and I can't thank them enough. I would highly recommend booking this venue for your occasion.

We visited another wedding venue, Hakone Estate and Gardens, before we decided to go with Boulder Ridge. The big difference is Boulder Ridge offers different all-inclusive packages...

. They have the vendors for cake, food, decoration, flowers, photography (not included), etc. We tried to call around for food catering and cake vendors because we wanted to serve Indonesian food with a unique cake flavor. But, in the end, not many of them could cater on our date. A lot of phone tags as well. So, then, when we met and had a tour with Heather at the end of October 2021, we decided this was it. We love the outdoor and indoor spaces. Heather is such a warm and friendly person. She took us through what would happen every step of the way (cake tasting, food tasting, decoration, flowers, the credits for wedding invitations, etc.) and answered a lot of our questions. We only wanted to do a wedding reception, no ceremony and everything worked out well. After paying the initial deposit and deciding on the date, come November 2021, we were given a detail binder containing all the thorough info that we needed to know. So, our wedding date is February 2022. Only 3 months for planning, which is sufficient with Wedgewood because they are very thorough and organized. Karyn and Heather provided exceptional service. They truly love their work and it shows during our planning visits and the day of the event. They answered our emails, phone calls, and questions thoroughly. We had no stress when dealing with Wedgewood because they have scheduled dates and they made sure everything was complete during the meeting. They were very accommodating with everything that we wanted and some changing plans. On the day of the event, Karyn was very attentive. She made sure that we were relaxed, got us drinks when we were taking pictures outside with our families, constantly checked in with us, and got us each two plates of food when the food was served to make sure that we ate (I have heard bride and groom usually end up not eating during the event). We are very grateful to have Karyn on the day of the event. She made our wedding amazing! The event captain was very organized in making sure all items were picked up and gathered on the cart when the event ended. All the internal vendors are truly amazing as well. Shawna, the flower pieces are very beautiful, Debbie, the cake is very delicious, and Pierre, the 80's songs are perfect! We got the photo booth, which was super fun for everyone at the event, had our own photography service, and had a harpist. It is now June 2022. we can still remember that day clearly where we danced until the end of the event. We highly recommend Boulder Ridge. They make our wedding planning so easy and no stress. Thank you very much!

Our event experts, Lauren, Karyn, Heather, and Sierra were so friendly, made us feel comfortable, and welcomed. They are literally one text or call away from answering any questions that we had. Sierra was our coordinator for our wedding day and made it a point to make sure everything went smoothly.

A few things that stood out: \- they were very flexible and understanding when we asked to move our wedding date (due to covid restrictions). i've heard some venues were not flexible at all. they reached out to all of our vendors to make the date change. we didn't have to do anything. another reason why wedgewood weddings are the way to go! \- they're very responsive. it was my 1st time planning a wedding so i asked a million questions and they responded promptly and never made me feel like i was asking a stupid question. :) \- Heather and Priscilla are super organized and always sent my fiancé and me reminders for our meetings (zoom and in person), made sure we weren't missing any deadlines, and kept us on track throughout the entire process. They pay attention to DETAIL. I couldn't have asked for a better team to work with. Our wedding was perfect. Thanks Heather & Priscilla for everything you did.

Don’t waste anytime looking elsewhere. This is the place to have your wedding. In late July, we had a call w/ Wedgewood prepared to cancel because we decided to have a small, int...

imate, wedding (immediate family & bridal party only - 14 guests). We didn’t want to pay the minimums required by Wedgewood with this small party. On the call, Wedgewood said they were happy to waive the minimums if we wanted to keep our original date/venue. I was nearly in tears with joy! With all the horror stories I’ve heard of venues not working with their brides/grooms, I was stunned with the graciousness Wedgewood extended. It didn’t stop there! We used their “Blissful Benefits” to discover local vendors they had relationships with - we found a lovely, affordable harpist! We would’ve never thought of that! Our Wedgewood wedding captain/coordinators/superstars Sierra & Lauren were with us every step of the way. Even standing up for us in email communication. Look, no bride wants to be lectured. And that’s what happened. One of my vendors (my alpaca farmer - I wanted 2 alpacas at the wedding!) lectured me over email about having a wedding during COVID. I get her perspective & a simple decline would’ve been fine. Instead, some strongly worded emails came from her. Lauren, Sierra, & their manager(?), jumped in on the email trail to defend my now husband and I to my great relief. Like what??? I was so impressed and was able to breathe. Needless to say, we had to cancel our alpacas. The Wedgewood team continued to be right by our side. During our wedding rehearsal, someone from the country club interrupted us stating they needed to mow the lawn and refused to leave. Sierra & Lauren firmly spoke to the guy to tell him he needed to come back to mow the lawn. (He was NOT pleasant and didn’t want to leave.) but they were able to get him out so we could finish our rehearsal! & one more thing. We decided to add a zoom portion to our wedding & hired a separate remote vendor to administer - basically, we used 4 iPhones on tripods which this vendor switched views (felt like a tv production almost). This added another layer of complication- Sierra & Lauren handled with ease. They worked with our vendor to coordinate the camera angles, even helped turn our iPhone to get the right shot, and troubleshoot technical issues. On the day of the wedding, I realized their was a miscommunication with me and our florist. WHERE WERE MY ROSE PETALS DOWN THE AISLE? They were nowhere in sight. Sierra remedied the situation ASAP, got her team to Safeway, bought up all the roses, peeled them and got them on the aisle just like I wanted. From the views (AMAZING), to the appetizers and food (actually pretty tasty!!), to the awesome bartender. Sierra & Lauren always kept a smile on my face. They are awesome and I was a lot. My “small, intimate, wedding” grew into a small intimate wedding/tv production. With every request, question and unexpected turn, Sierra & Lauren responded with friendliness, support, & most importantly, a warm and kind smile. Our wedding experience wouldn’t have been the same without them. Also, remember the alpacas that were cancelled? Sierra and Lauren knew how much the alpacas meant to me so they saved some alpaca balloons from an event that happened right before mine and put them in my bridal suite as a surprise. It’s those small warm loving care in the details that makes this place special. I hope you check them out. Thank you Boulder Ridge!

We are so thankful for the most amazing wedding. Even in the middle of a pandemic, our coordinators made us feel so supported and taken care of. Due to COVID, we decided to change ...

venues with just 3 months left before our wedding. Zoe from Wedgewood Redwood Canyon was there with us from our first tour, and we were lucky enough to keep her for our wedding day once we changed venues. Lauren from Boulder Ridge helped take over with planning when we changed locations. Both coordinators were our rocks throughout the process and were there for us up until the very last, nerve-wrecking moments. I can't speak highly enough of them! I’d definitely recommend Wedgewood because of their easy wedding planning process. They have a list of recommended vendors they include in your package, but it’s also SO easy to take any out and go with your own vendors. They don’t charge you random fees like many other venues and their pricing is reasonable! Plus, you have a coordinator with you through the entire process. They helped me along the way with details I would have never thought of. I’d also like to talk about Boulder Ridge as a location. It was absolutely beautiful and I’m so happy to have had our wedding here. Our guests were in awe of the views and the sunset! The pictures you’ll get with the backdrops are stunning!

From the very start, this team of sales reps were AMAZING to work with. We had a consultation in person (pre COVID) with the team, and still continued to shop around, as we didnt w...

ant to say "Yes" to the first place we looked at. After a month of looking at other venues, we knew Boulder Ridge by Wedgewood was it for us, they just had the best deal and a GORGEOUS view you could not beat for the price. I called them back right away, crossing my fingers they still had our date available, only to find out, they saved the date for us without a deposit- who does that?! The was just the first time the team showed how much they truly care about making the wedding planning experience both easy and enjoyable. The second time they wow'ed us, was when COVID hit. We heard other Wedgewood locations were postponing weddings, which we absolutely did not want to do because our wedding date was so significant (10.10.2020). But, the general manager, Angela, worked with us and rest assured we would be able to have a beautiful wedding on our special date. She proposed a split wedding, ceremony on our date and reception postponed to the following year (which were on board with, because we really wanted to keep our friends and family safe and did not want any in person guests). Angela was so professional in working out our package deal, we didn't lose or have to spend more money, it all worked out and we kept our same price package. The Sales Team is outstanding!!! Lauren and Sierra both were extremely helpful all the days leading up to the wedding and especially on our big day. Lauren was very intuitive about my vision and easily coordinated with the accompanying vendors to stay on schedule during our wedding. Sierra was hands on, helping with the few in person guests we had, arranging and re-arranging decor, and also helped wrangle our 2.5 year old, while the B&G took photos. I have to say, the Sales Team/Wedding Coordinators are 100% there for you and it felt so genuine. Although we had a very small COVID wedding, and didnt utilize their DJ, Bar, or Food Service, there isn't a doubt in my mind that those service too, will be outstanding to work with next year and I look forward to returning for our in person wedding reception. Thank you so much to the Boulder Ridge Wedgewood Team for making a huge impact in our day. You guys have got all the details dialed in and I would highly recommend your services to anyone looking for a pain free all inclusive wedding package!

We were lucky to find Wedgewood Weddings while searching for our wedding venue over a year ago and I am so glad we chose this company! Weddings are already stressful to plan but wi...

th everything going on in the world we were worried we would have to postpone or even cancel our wedding. Thanks to Wedgewood we not only got to keep our date but our wedding turned out more amazing than we ever thought possible! We originally chose a different Wedgewood location which could no longer accommodate our wedding with the COVID19 restrictions so we were offered the chance to tour Boulder Ridge and host an outdoor ceremony and reception. We loved the new venue and made the difficult choice to relocate our entire wedding two weeks before our date! Wedgewood contacted all of our vendors and transferred everything to our new venue so we didn’t have to start the whole process over and just made everything so easy! Lauren was extremely sweet and helpful with everything! Any questions we had, she was quick to respond and was available whenever we needed! Between COVID19 and the recent fires in our area we had to make several last minute changes and it seemed like everything was going wrong but somehow Lauren and the team at Boulder Ridge made our wedding the most amazingly perfect day of our lives! It was so beautiful and we will never forget it! Highly recommend this company!!!

e process was amazing! They always answer the phone and they email you back pretty fast! Our wedding day was perfect I have literally nothing bad to say. Sierra was our wedding coordinator and she was wonderful! Please don’t think twice about this venue! All my friends and family members still talk about it every time we see them. We are 100% satisfied with our experience 😍

My consultants were so sweet and friendly! The venue speaks for itself, it's breath taking and feels very exclusive and is SO well taken care of. It definitely sells itself. But wh...

at really sold me was the staff. My two consultants were transparent about pricing, and made me feel so comfortable. I would highly recommend anyone to check out Boulder Ridge! Their wedding packages are inclusive, but they don't cheap our on what they include. You can be sure you're going to have a beautiful wedding here no matter what package you choose or create!

We had our ceremony and reception on 09/01/2019 here and had a blast! From the consultation to the big day, Lauren and Heather were nothing short of accommodating and amazing. A we...

dding planner/binder was provided once we made our deposit and it provided step-by-step instructions on what was needed and by when. The scheduled meetings and calls also reassured us that this team would take care of us and our guests. Honestly, weddings are hard, especially with 200 guests, but Lauren and Heather have been in the industry long enough that they are ready for anything! Boulder Ridge is setup on top of a gorgeous hill overlooking the Almaden Valley. Majority of our guests congregated outside, even at night, just to take in the views. Valet is provided with a fee per person. Both our ceremony and reception areas were setup beautifully and exactly as we had requested. We did not go with the in-house catering, but the team was able to coordinate with all vendors to ensure an effortless night. Shout out to Lauren for coordinating the wedding before and on the day of. Oh ! and thanks for reminding us to stay on schedule. We had a difficult crowd, but you held it together! Forever thankful to the Wedgewood Team!

ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! I don't know what I'd do without Lauren and her team at Boulder Ridge. The service I received from Lauren was second to none. She listened to all my needs and w...

ants, executed everything perfectly, and always put our happiness first. She went completely above and beyond for us - I couldn't have asked for a better venue coordinator. She is amazing! Super sweet, extremely thoughtful and caring, very organized and just an overall pleasure to be around. Love her personality! Trying to plan a wedding is immensely overwhelming - but with Lauren by my side guiding me the entire way through, it was manageable! All my questions were answered timely and efficiently, she kept my days organized and assisted with all my priorities - and she definitely handled all the vendors impeccably! Everything went by sooooo smoothly at my wedding. No hiccups at all. Every detail was covered thanks to Lauren and the team!
