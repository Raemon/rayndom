## 12+ Months Out From Wedding

If you're in this section of the wedding planning list, chances are you're looking to find out exactly [what to do after getting engaged](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-planning-tips-to-get-organized). (Look at you, so organized.) But before you dive into this year-long planning checklist for wedding perfection, know there's no such thing as the "right" engagement length, which means there's no pressure to follow a wedding planning timeline that doesn't fit your needs. Quickly below, see what you need to do before hashing out how to plan a wedding with our step-by-step checklist:

**12+ months before wedding planning checklist at a glance:**

  * **Mull over your wedding vision:** Start gleaning inspiration and thinking through the big-picture questions in terms of the aesthetic of your celebration.
  * **Lay research groundwork:** Set yourself up with an account on The Knot to ensure you have access to helpful planning tools (and a boatload of inspo).
  * **Consider an engagement party:** Whether you throw it yourselves or not, figure out if you want to mark the occasion with a celebration.  




"My advice to couples is the same as it's always been: [wedding planning] should be a joyful experience," says celebrity event planner [David Tutera](https://davidtutera.com/). "Take your time to think about what you both want without racing down the aisle." 

A wedding planning timeline is not one-size-fits-all, which is why we've crafted this wedding to-do list to work regardless of how much time you have to plan. While it's modeled as a 12-month wedding checklist, you can use this guide for whatever amount of time you do have—just follow the order of tasks and you'll be good to go.

According to The Knot Real Weddings Study, [the average engagement length](https://www.theknot.com/content/too-long-to-be-engaged) is 15 months. So, when you're 13-15 months out from the big day, use this time to research, gather ideas and create a vision. Think about what you want your wedding to look like. What colors speak to you? Would you like to follow a theme? Where do you want to exchange vows? What do you think you'd like to wear? We recommend browsing [Real Wedding galleries](https://www.theknot.com/real-weddings/albums) to gather ideas and inspo from other couples just like you,

**The Knot Editor Tip:** "If you're newly engaged, I recommend following wedding planners on Instagram, especially those who are local to the area where you want to get married," says [MaryKate Callahan](https://www.theknot.com/content/author/marykate-callahan), The Knot Director of Content Strategy. "Getting these accounts on your feed is a passive way to start researching and gathering inspo. Anytime you see something wedding-related that sparks joy, save it! Pro tip: Check the tagged vendors and see which ones seem to be popping up more than others—it's a great way to narrow down your list of which vendors to contact through The Knot."

If you want to [plan an engagement party](https://www.theknot.com/content/engagement-parties-411), now's a great time to do so as well. After all, we totally recommend letting loose and celebrating before getting into the weeds of your wedding checklist. While it's common for friends or family to host a soirée in your honor, you can also throw one yourself. There's no such thing as celebrating your engagement too many times.

When you are ready to dive into wedding planning, set up an account on [The Knot](https://www.theknot.com/) and download [The Knot App](https://theknot.app.link/D0tmd4opvCb). Yea, we're a little biased, but our [wedding planning tools](https://www.theknot.com/content/our-top-wedding-planning-tools) will help you simplify and streamline the planning process, from creating a budget to crafting your wedding website. Not to mention, it's all 100% free.

## 12 Months Out From Wedding

You're officially a year out—yay! Now's the time to put those high-level plans in motion. Here's where we dive into that wedding planning timeline. If you're looking for the highlights of this section of the wedding planning checklist, see the bullets below.

**12 months before wedding planning checklist at a glance:**

  * **Determine your priorities:** Decide on what you're prioritizing for your wedding in terms of details like season and location as well as top vendors.
  * **Set your budget:** Nail down a number and also handle if family members (like your parents) would like to contribute to your wedding.
  * **Get a guest list in order:** Figure out non-negotiable guests and a target guest number so you're ready to tour venues.



[Make a Personalized Timeline](https://theknot.com/your-wedding-plan)

### Chat With Wedding Stakeholders

Before you can get into any planning details, you'll need to have a conversation with potential wedding stakeholders—AKA any additional people beyond you and your S.O. who will help fund the wedding. Once you have a general idea of who's contributing (and how much), you can move forward with setting a concrete budget and finalizing wedding plans.

### Set Your Wedding Budget and Size 

The single most important wedding checklist task to complete first is setting your budget, because this number will influence every subsequent planning decision. Now is also the time to figure out who is contributing to the wedding budget; If multiple people will be paying, you'll need to discuss which expenses each person is covering.

As you begin to set your budget, this will require you to think about the potential size of your wedding too. You don't need to get in the weeds with exactly [who to invite to your wedding](https://www.theknot.com/content/who-to-invite-to-wedding) just yet, but the guest list count will influence the overall cost, as well as the venue you book. Now's the time to determine whether you want something small and intimate or large and lavish, because this will have a direct impact on the cost of your wedding and your [wedding budget breakdown](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-budget-ways-to-save-money). "Brainstorming your guest list and talking about an overall budget are the first tasks you should do," advises Ashley Tangerini, wedding planner for [Mavinhouse Events](https://mavinhouse.com/). "These two go hand in hand and will help shape the venues and vendors you procure. It's important to know the financial limits you may be working with."

To get an idea of a standard overall budget for your wedding area and how it breaks down, consult [The Knot Budget Advisor](https://www.theknot.com/wedding-budget) at this stage in your wedding planning timetable. It's backed by real data from real couples and will give you a great jumping off point to tweak and customize your spend as you see fit (which you can do right in the tool). 

[See What Real Couples Spend](https://www.theknot.com/wedding-budget)

### Discuss Your Priorities

Once your budget is set, talk about your [wedding priorities](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-planning-top-priorities). Determining what's most important to you (and therefore what you'll spend your budget on) will help clarify a lot of the below tasks. Is having a great live band a must for your reception? Perhaps you'll allocate more funds to entertainment and spend less on late-night snacks. Or, if a large, fresh floral installation is at the top of your wish list, maybe you'll opt for simpler table rentals to balance out the budget. It's important to be on the same page about what you need, what you want and where you're willing to compromise.

### Decide If You'll Use a Planner

Next, think about whether or not you'll [hire a wedding planner](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-to-hire-a-wedding-planner). Of all the vendors who will join your squad of pros, a planner will be the most involved from start to finish. If a full-service planner fits into your budget, hire them as soon as possible so they can guide you through the process. If a month-of or day-of coordinator is a better fit for your needs, this is still something you'll want to decide when you're 12 months out from your wedding day. "Don't wait until the last minute to seek out help," says Sheavonne Harris, wedding planner and founder of [Events by Sheavonne](https://eventsbysheavonne.com/). "Lock in a wedding coordinator sooner than later."

[Find Your Wedding Planner](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/wedding-planners)

### Get Your Planning Tools in Order

Figuring out how you'll stay organized throughout the wedding planning process is almost as important as the checklist for wedding preparation itself. Yes, there are some who prefer the ol' wedding planning binder with tabs and folders, but for many, online tools and [apps](https://www.theknot.com/content/top-apps-need-for-wedding-planning) are the way to go. Your best bet? The Knot wedding planning app lets you plan right from your phone, and offers everything you need from a customized checklist to the ability to search for vendors on the go. We mentioned this might be a good thing to set up ahead of being a year out to give you time to gather inspo and play around. But if you didn't beforehand, now's the time. Also, the [Your Wedding Plan](https://theknot.com/your-wedding-plan) function on The Knot will help you break down your planning tasks into phases and bite-sized steps.

[Download The Knot App](https://theknot.app.link/D0tmd4opvCb)

### Research and Tour Wedding Venues

Picking your venue is another wedding planning checklist task that should be accomplished early on. As we mentioned above, it'll be helpful to have a general idea of the size of your wedding when you begin researching. Most wedding venues have minimum and maximum guest counts (add a query about this to your list of [questions to ask a venue](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-venue-site-tour-questions-to-ask)), which will help you narrow down the list of potential places to exchange vows. A small loft that can only hold 50 guests max, for example, might not be the place for you if you're envisioning 200+ people. It's also helpful to note that many venues are booking faster than years past. If you have your heart set on a specific [unique wedding venue](https://www.theknot.com/content/unique-wedding-venues) for a fall Saturday wedding, you'll want to book it as soon as possible. Your preferred venue or timeframe could also come into play when it comes to [how to pick your wedding date](https://www.theknot.com/content/picking-the-perfect-wedding-date).

According to [The Knot Real Weddings Study](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-data-insights/real-weddings-study), 73% of all weddings fall between May and October (that's why we call it [wedding season](https://www.theknot.com/content/is-there-an-off-season-for-weddings)!) With this in mind, book your venue as early as possible, especially if you want a day that's highly in-demand, like a Friday or Saturday.

[Find Your Wedding Venue](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/wedding-reception-venues)

### Begin Pulling Style and Decor Inspiration

Consider this one of our favorite wedding checklist tasks. Picking [a theme or style](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-theme-ideas) allows you to get creative and think about the ways your personalities can shine through your wedding. Take our [Style Quiz](https://www.theknot.com/wedding-vision) to narrow down a look that's right for you. (You'll also get tons of personalized inspiration and planning tips at the end.) And don't forget to buy [The Knot Magazine](https://www.theknot.com/content/the-knot-magazine-subscription-details) for even more amazing inspo. And as you peruse our Real Weddings and articles, make use of the Favoriting function to easily save your inspo shots to your account in the [Your Favorites section](https://www.theknot.com/your-favorites/inspiration). Just click the little heart whenever you like what you see. 

The options for your wedding style are truly endless. Whether you're dreaming of a whimsical cottagecore garden soirée, a high-class glam party at a modern loft or a bucolic rustic barn party, this is your chance to make your celebration a reflection of the colors, themes and styles you love most.

## 11 Months Out From Wedding

With just under a year left until your nuptials, here's what's next on your wedding planning timeline.

**11 months before wedding planning checklist at a glance:**

  * **Pick a time and place:** Now's the time to finalize your venue and wedding date.
  * **Get guests in order:** Plan out your preliminary guest list and get started on gathering guest mailing addresses.
  * **Select wedding attendants:** If you want a wedding party, choose who will stand at the altar with you now.



### Touch Base With Non-Negotiable Guests and Vendors

If you're stuck between a few potential dates, we recommend touching base with your must-have wedding guests and vendors. If your maid of honor will be at another wedding the weekend you're considering, you may have to shift your date. Or if you've had your eye on a particular photographer for years, reach out to gauge their availability for your preferred date. This will help you eliminate days that won't work for the people you _need_ in attendance.

### Finalize Your Date and Venue

At this point, your date should be set in stone. It is the most important piece of the puzzle, after all. "Hotels and event venues are now filling up quickly with weddings, so couples wishing to confirm their perfect location should plan to book about one year out," remarks Kate Thompson, Area Director of Sales and [Viceroy Washington D.C.](https://www.viceroyhotelsandresorts.com/washington-dc) You'll need to know your date and venue in order to [book your vendors](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace)...

### Find your kind of venue

From barns to ballrooms, discover reception venues that feel like you.

### Start Booking Vendors

...which is next on your wedding planning checklist. While there's not a specific order in which you have to [book your vendors](https://www.theknot.com/content/when-to-book-wedding-vendors), the venue typically comes first. You'll need the location to book all other pros. It can be helpful to earmark priority vendors during this time as vendor schedules book up quickly. We recommend using a tool like [The Knot Vendor Marketplace](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace) to connect with local pros in your area. Not only can you read reviews from real couples, we make it easy to reach out and set up interviews to help you hire the experts who are best fit for your wedding vision.

[Book Your Wedding Vendors](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace)

### Determine Your Wedding Party

Now's the time in your wedding to-do list to think about who you want standing beside you in your wedding party. Crafting your lineup may take some time, so start thinking about it early on before you need to shop for wedding party attire later in your wedding planning calendar. Once you know who you'd like to ask, start planning [wedding party proposals](https://www.theknot.com/content/creative-ways-to-ask-bridesmaids) as soon as possible.

### Finalize Your Guest List

Your wedding party and guest list go hand in hand. You already have a general idea of how many people will be invited, but now's the time to sit down with your S.O. and bring the guest list to life. Have important conversations about who definitely needs to be there, as well as who doesn't. If you're making hard cuts, respectfully[ tell people they aren't invited](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-to-tell-someone-they-arent-invited-to-the-wedding). And if you're looking for a guide on [how to make your guest list](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-to-make-your-wedding-guest-list) without drama, we can help with that too. Once you have your names down, it's time to start collecting guest addresses to send your correspondence to. Click the button below to mark that task off your wedding planner tick list.

[Nail Your Guest List With Ease](https://www.theknot.com/gs/guest-list)

## 10 Months Out From Wedding

Your 10-month wedding checklist is all about diving into important details, like your wedding attire and hotel room blocks. We take you through it step-by-step.

**10 months before wedding planning checklist at a glance:**

  * **Assemble your accommodations:** Book your hotel room and a hotel block for your guests.
  * **Shop for attire:** Start shopping for your wedding looks so you have time for fittings down the line.
  * **Book transportation for the wedding weekend:** This includes your getaway car and guest shuttles.



### Start Shopping for Wedding Day Attire

The 10-month wedding mark is the time to start shopping for your wedding attire. *Cue happy dancing.* You'll need plenty of time to peruse [local wedding dress salons](https://www.theknot.com/content/affordable-bridal-shops) and suit shops to find the perfect look, so begin early to allow time for browsing, fittings, alterations and any potential customizations.

The same thoughtful consideration that wedding dresses receive applies to shopping for wedding suits and tuxedos as well. "It's never too early to start shopping for a wedding suit or tuxedo, but we find that most of our couples begin shopping between three and six months prior to the wedding," says Jeanne Foley, co-founder of [SuitShop](https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1945580&u=1030781&m=120753&urllink=https%3A%2F%2Fsuitshop%2Ecom%2F&afftrack=TKEditorial). We recommend starting as early as possible. "Much like shopping for a wedding dress, you'll first want to decide on the style, level of formality, and color scheme for your big day, then begin shopping for suits," she explains. "Considering your budget is a great way to start narrowing down your suiting selection." If you won't be shopping off the rack for your wedding day attire, finalize your purchase by the end of this month.

### Book Hotel Room Blocks and Transportation

Your out-of-town guests may be traveling far from home to attend your nuptials. It's common for couples to provide [room blocks](https://www.theknot.com/content/hotel-room-blocks-101) at a nearby hotel (or onsite at your venue if you'll be celebrating at a resort or another space with lodging). "It's ideal to have family and friends staying together at one location, especially so you can truly enjoy your time together," says Tosha Wollney, Senior Catering Sales Executive at [Westin Cape Coral Resort at Marina Village](https://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/rswwi-the-westin-cape-coral-resort-at-marina-village/).

Some locations may only confirm your room reservations up to a year in advance. So, if you're starting the planning process early, you may only be able to confirm a "soft hold" until the year mark. Talk to your venue or a potential hotel about the options they have and how those can fit into your planning timeline. Also, start to look into [local transportation services](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-transportation-costs-tips-trends) if you'll be shuttling guests to and from the ceremony and reception venues.

## 9 Months Out From Wedding

You've got nine months to go—hooray! Here's what to focus on for your nine-month wedding planning list.

**9 months before wedding planning checklist at a glance:**

  * **Select save-the-dates:** Choose a design now so you can mail them on time.
  * **Schedule engagement photos:** Schedule these earlier if you'd like the photos to appear on your save-the-dates.
  * **Pick a band or DJ:** Now's the time to pick what you'd like to dance to, a band or a DJ.



### Choose Save-the-Dates

Invites, save-the-dates and programs, oh my! At nine months out, it's the time in your wedding planning tick list to start thinking about your [wedding stationery](https://www.theknot.com/content/everything-to-know-about-wedding-stationery). This includes all of your required paper, from save-the-dates to RSVP cards to formal invitations and even your ceremony programs and place cards.

A lot of paper goes into planning your nuptials, but here's the good news: You can find everything you need at [The Knot Invitations](https://www.theknot.com/paper). At this stage in the wedding to-do list, it's time to choose a design that reflects your wedding style. You'll want to have these finalized during this time period, because next month your save-the-dates should go out in the mail.

If you do want specialized stationery, it's important to begin shopping as early as possible. "It's often a surprise to new couples that specialized stationery can take a lot of time to produce," explains Heather Wiese Alexander, etiquette expert and founder of stationery brand [Bell'INVITO](https://www.bellinvito.com/). You'll want plenty of cushion time to test samples and land on the perfect design. Right now, finding a save-the-date design is your top priority. You'll have more time to choose formal invites in a few weeks.

[What to Write on Save-the-Dates](https://www.theknot.com/content/save-the-dates-design-qa)

### Plan Your Entertainment

Let's talk music and entertainment. It plays a big role in your wedding day, from the moment you walk down the aisle until the last song ends at your after party. If you haven't already booked live performers, think about what kind of pro is right for your party, whether it's a [live band or a DJ](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-reception-music-bands-vs-djs). Book their services around this point, and start thinking about specific [song requests](https://www.theknot.com/content/best-wedding-songs) you want to make. When your wedding date is closer, your pro will likely ask for a list of must-play songs, as well as a [do-not-play list](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-songs-to-skip).

### Begin Booking Rentals

Rentals are a huge part of your wedding. From large pieces like tents and tables to smaller details like chargers and linens, rentals are essential for completing the ambiance and setup of your ceremony and reception. Because supplies are limited, it's imperative to secure what you need early on. 

"Rentals should be booked at least nine months to a year out from your wedding," explains Carey Bisonet, President of [Alpine Events](https://www.alpineevents.com/). "Inventory is limited for most suppliers and events book up fast so the sooner the better."

Ultimately, there's no such thing as renting too early, especially for large pieces like tents or flooring. In fact, according to Tim Sperry, CEO of [Sperry Tents](https://www.sperrytents.com/), "it's very important to consider a region's busy season. For example, coveted weekends in June and September always close first, oftentimes many months in advance. Also, as tent reservations increase in the off-season, our most in-demand tent sizes become unavailable as well. So, to get the tent of your dreams on the date of your choice, plan way ahead."

Coordinating your rentals far in advance will also help the rest of [your wedding vision](https://www.theknot.com/wedding-vision) (and [your wedding budget](https://www.theknot.com/wedding-budget)) fall into place. "One reason to start early is because the tent and other 'big picture' items like flooring and lighting play a major role in budgeting, particularly when they are in addition to venue fees," Sperry adds. "A site visit might bring up unforeseen costs, such as generators, electric panels, catering tents and more. You'll want to reserve your equipment as early as possible to lock in your desired tent size and wedding date."

### Have an Engagement Photo Session

If you haven't already, consider booking an engagement photoshoot. We recommend [working with your wedding photographer](https://www.theknot.com/content/engagement-photographer) if you've secured one, as this is a great way to get to know them before the big day and establish a connection. The more comfortable you are with your photographer, the more comfortable you'll feel in front of the camera—which will result in stunning photos. You'll be so grateful to have photos documenting this special time in your life. Plus, you can use your favorite shots on your wedding website and your invitations—how's that for multi-tasking?

## 8 Months Out From Wedding

Now things are really getting into motion with the wedding planning timeline. Need an eight-month wedding checklist? We've got you covered.

**8 months before wedding planning checklist at a glance:**

  * **Build your wedding website:** This is where your guests will check for any and all wedding related details.
  * **Start your registry:** It's important to get your registry up early so guests can shop ahead of showers and other relevant events.
  * **Mail save-the-dates:** Send your save-the-dates so guests can mark their calendars. 



### Wedding Website

It's time to make your wedding website, as it's the ultimate resource for guests. It's a hub that houses all of your wedding details that can be easily referenced to answer questions. Plus, you can have a lot of fun customizing your site to match your wedding theme (and stationery, if you get yours on The Knot), thus creating an engaging guest experience. Dedicate part of your early wedding planning tasks to making your website a creative (and helpful) guide for your loved ones. One of the top [wedding website tips](https://www.theknot.com/content/best-wedding-websites): Your save-the-dates will go out this month, so we recommend having your registry and wedding website in tip-top shape by the time your stationery hits mailboxes.

[Start Your Wedding Website](https://www.theknot.com/gs/wedding-websites?vers=6)

### Make Your Registry

We're of the mindset that making your wedding registry is actually one of the most exciting tasks on your wedding planning checklist. Why, you ask? You get to shop for gifts for your newlywed life that other people will buy for you. That's pretty epic in our eyes. In case you aren't aware, [registry gifts](https://www.theknot.com/content/best-wedding-registry-ideas) are insanely amazing these days. You might associate wedding registries with department stores and scan guns, fine china and endless sets of extra linen. But did you know you can register for cash funds, [gift cards](https://www.theknot.com/content/gift-cards-wedding-registry), [experiences](https://www.theknot.com/content/experience-registry-gift-ideas) and really cool gifts, like state-of-the-art espresso machines or money for adopting a pet? It's true—and it's safe to say that registries are better than they've ever been before.

It's important to [make your registry in advance](https://www.theknot.com/content/when-do-you-register-for-your-wedding), as this will help you avoid receiving unwanted gifts from well-meaning loved ones. (Read: If you don't want another set of pots to clutter up your kitchen cabinets, a registry will help you avoid that.) Plus, your friends and fam will want to start showering you with presents as soon as possible, so a registry will help keep their shopping on track.

[Create Your Wedding Registry](https://www.theknot.com/registry)

### Send Save-the-Dates

It just got real. Now's the time to pop your [save-the-dates](https://www.theknot.com/content/save-the-dates-design-qa) in the mail. Sending out these stationery cards at least eight months before the big day will give guests plenty of time to clear their schedules. But if you're excited to get them in the hands of your guests, you don't have to wait until the eight-month mark. "Save-the-dates can go out as early as a year in advance," Alexander says. If you're planning a destination wedding, you could even do this step when you're at the year mark or earlier. What matters most, though, is that guests have plenty of time to plan accordingly.

### Secure Insurance Policies

If there's one thing the pandemic taught us, it's that you [shouldn't skip wedding insurance](https://www.theknot.com/content/postponed-wedding-insurance). Understanding policies and their terms and conditions can feel overwhelming at first, but making sure you and your loved ones are protected is a top consideration when planning. Use these comprehensive [wedding insurance guide](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-insurance-101) to find coverage that fits your budget.

[Wedding Insurance 101](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-insurance-101)

### Daydream About Your Honeymoon

Here's a bright spot in your wedding planning journey: It's time to start thinking about [your honeymoon](https://www.theknot.com/content/honeymoon-definition-guide)! Where do you [want to go](https://www.theknot.com/content/best-honeymoon-destinations)? Do you want to depart right after your wedding, or would you rather give yourself time to unwind and soak up that just-married bliss before extending the celebration? Regardless of what you choose, we're big proponents of taking a honeymoon—you deserve it after all this planning.

**The Knot Editor Tip:** "You'll only be newlyweds once, making the honeymoon a trip to savor as you embark on marriage," says [Esther Lee](https://www.theknot.com/content/author/esther-lee), The Knot Director of Editorial Brand. "If you're crunched for time, book a minimoon to an easily accessible destination (a short flight and/or a car ride away) after the wedding. This can be an extended weekend getaway with the eventual plan to enjoy a full latermoon at your dream, far-flung honeymoon destination. Plus, a trip for yourselves is the perfect way to decompress after the wedding…especially when it involves a luxury resort and a delicious piña colada."

To stay on top of travel deadlines, start looking into potential locations to see how they match up to your wedding timeline now. (Think: Would your trip fall into your potential location's busy or off-season? Are there any weather-related concerns to keep in mind?) While you can definitely start planning this on your own, we also recommend using a [honeymoon travel agent](https://www.theknot.com/content/working-with-travel-agents-for-the-honeymoon) if you'd rather have someone else take on the majority of the planning for you.

## 7 Months Out From Wedding

Give yourself a pat on the back, because you've made it so far on the wedding planning checklist. And, can we just say—you're crushing this whole wedding planning thing. Here's your official seven-month wedding checklist.

**7 months before wedding planning checklist at a glance:**

  * **Select your wedding party attire:** Give your attendants ample time to order their outfits so they have a cushion for alterations.
  * **Book your rehearsal dinner:** Pick a time and place.
  * **Finalize your vendors:** You should have all vendors booked by now so you can guarantee you have the team you need.



### Shop for Wedding Party Attire

Once you have an idea of what you and your S.O. will wear on the big day, it's time to think about your wedding party too. Think of wedding party outfits as puzzle pieces—you'll need the big pieces first, like the location, wedding dress and wedding suit, in order to find outfits for your crew that fit in perfectly with your aesthetic. Then, order them as early as possible to leave time for fittings and alterations. 

"We highly recommend that you order wedding party dresses at least three months in advance," Lee says. "Not every dress is going to fit like a glove, so you'll want ample time for exchanges or alterations."

### Finalize All Vendor Hires

By now, almost all of your vendors should be booked. You'll be able to complete contracts a few months from now, especially because not all of them can be finalized until product amounts are determined (like flowers, for example). But, at this stage of the wedding checklist timeline, you'll need to be sure your pros are locked in and ready to help you finalize planning.

### Secure the Rehearsal Dinner Location

As the precursor to your wedding day, your rehearsal dinner is one element you'll want to pay attention to. Some wedding venues may have the ability to host your rehearsal dinner one or two days before your wedding date, which you'll want to inquire about as soon as possible. Or if you want to host this prewedding gathering at a nearby hotel, a favorite restaurant or a neutral location, book your event as early as possible. In fact, you can book your rehearsal dinner location up to a year in advance to lock in your preferred spot. If someone other than you and your S.O. will be hosting (perhaps either of your parents), they can take control of booking the location.

## 6 Months Out From Wedding

Take a moment and breathe deeply: You're officially six months out from your wedding date. Here's what comes next on your wedding planning calendar.

**6 months before wedding planning checklist at a glance:**

  * **Book hair and makeup team:** Hire pros to pull off your beauty look.
  * **Get invitations in order:** Ensure your suite is finalized and you nail the details from invites to enclosure cards.
  * **Select wedding bands:** Pick a wedding band six months ahead to account for resizing time. 



### Attend Premarital Counseling

While not necessary, attending premarital counseling can be a great way to prepare for being together forever. (Basically, this item should be on both your wedding checklist and your checklist for marriage.) In these sessions, you and your S.O. will work with family counselors, religious leaders or even other married couples to communicate your wants and needs while aligning your goals and expectations for life after the wedding.

[Premarital Counseling Guide](https://www.theknot.com/content/premarital-counseling)

### Shop for Wedding Bands and Day-of Accessories

Don't forget about your wedding jewelry. This is one of the most exciting tasks on your wedding planning checklist. Around six months out from the date, start shopping for your wedding bands. It's common to buy through the same retailer or jeweler that designed your engagement ring, especially if you want a wedding band that corresponds with the design—but the choice is ultimately yours. What matters most is that you give yourself ample time to try different styles to find the perfect fit.

"I tell people to really take their time and think about what speaks to them and to find something that represents their love and partnership," says Toni Zehrer, SVP and Chief Merchandising Officer of [Signet Jewelers](https://www.signetjewelers.com/our-home/default.aspx). "Couples often come into a store thinking they want one thing, and sometimes choose something completely different, yet still perfect for them."

This process generally takes six to eight weeks, though it may take longer if you're opting for custom designs. We recommend starting to shop as early as possible to ensure the rings are in your possession long before the day of the wedding.

Additionally, ensure your day-of accessory lineup is set by now. Veils, cuff links, shoes, jewelry, ties, etc.—now's the time to finalize those details. 

[Pick the Perfect Rings](https://www.theknot.com/content/rules-for-choosing-your-wedding-bands)

### Renew Your Passports

If you're heading to a far-flung locale for your honeymoon, make sure those passports are up to date. Check the status of your passports early to leave plenty of time for any needed updates or exchanges.

### Secure Your Hair and Makeup Team

While you can certainly do your wedding hair and makeup on your own, you may prefer to hand that over to the pros. When you're six months out from the wedding date, your glam squad should be confirmed—you'll want to book your HMU trial three months from now to decide on a look.

[Book Your Beauty Pros](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/beauty-services)

### Complete Your Invitation Suite

At this point, you'll need to finalize the design for the rest of your invitation suite, because formal invites will need to be ordered next month. If you want all of your stationery to match, from the invites to the seating cards to the menu and even your table numbers, we recommend using [The Knot Invitations](https://www.theknot.com/paper). Or, if you'd like to get custom wedding invitations, now's the time to reach out to a stationer and begin bringing your paper dreams to life.

## 5 Months Out From Wedding

You've got five months to go on your wedding planning timeline! Here's what's included on your five-month wedding checklist.

**5 months before wedding planning checklist at a glance:**

  * **Plan your menu:** Work with your caterer to pick your meal style and choices.
  * **Buy your wedding event wardrobe:** From prewedding outfits to getting-ready jammies, buy them five months in advance.
  * **Book your officiant:** Now's the time to settle who will officiate so there's a long window to work on your ceremony.



### Order Formal Invitations

Your save-the-dates are already in the hands of guests, so now it's time to order your [formal invitations](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-invitations-etiquette). These don't have to go in the mail until two or three months before the wedding day, but it's crucial to buy them now so you have time to make sure they're in perfect condition before sending them out. (Plus, you'll need plenty of time to address those envelopes.)

### Plan Your Menu

Consider this one of our favorite wedding checklist tasks to complete. Food is the key to a great party, and now's the time to finalize what you want to serve on the big day. "The discussion of style of food and food service can begin early on, but usually clients aren't working with their caterer until about six months before their wedding," says Tangerini. "During that time frame, you can customize your menu and brainstorm out-of-the-box ideas." Now is also a great opportunity to set up a wedding cake tasting within the next month—you know, for _research_.

### Buy Additional Prewedding Outfits

Ready to go shopping again? While you already have your wedding dress or suit picked out, you'll need to shop for additional wedding outfits for all the fun parties coming your way. Think about what kind of attire you'll want to wear for your shower, bach party, rehearsal dinner, after-party and any additional wedding weekend soirées, like a day-after brunch or a kickoff happy hour. Now's the time to buy those outfits so you have plenty of time to steam, alter, and prepare them.

### Finalize Honeymoon Plans

You've done the necessary honeymoon daydreaming, so now it's time to finalize those plans. At this point in the wedding planning timeline, you should aim to have flights, lodging, and excursions booked.

**The Knot Editor Tip:** "This is where attitude matters," says Esther Lee. "There's a chance you might feel exhausted after experiencing the highs and lows of wedding planning. The honeymoon is a reward for all the hard work you've done while wedding planning, and it's also time for you and your partner to rejuvenate and reconnect alone."

### Book a Ceremony Officiant

If you aren't getting married in a religious institution, you'll need an [officiant](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-to-find-wedding-officiant). (For those getting married in religious settings, this step will come earlier when you book your ceremony.) Whether you'd like to have a trained officiant, a close friend or a family member preside over your ceremony, reach out and book their services now so they have plenty of time to prepare.

[Find Your Wedding Officiant](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/wedding-officiants)

### Begin Optional Wedding Beauty Upkeep

Interested in trying out a [teeth whitening treatment ](https://www.theknot.com/content/beauty-tips-white-teeth-wedding-whitestrips)or a new skincare routine? Now's the time to begin prewedding beauty upkeep. Keep in mind that this wedding checklist step is completely optional—but, if you do want to try out any new treatments, it's important to start now to allow your skin and body time to adjust. This will give you leeway to experiment and find what works best for you. (Read: You don't want to try a brand new skincare facial treatment a few weeks before the date, in case it doesn't work or you aren't pleased with the results.)

## 4 Months Out From Wedding

With four months to go until your nuptials, here's what comes next on your free wedding checklist.  
  
**4 months before wedding planning checklist at a glance:**

  * **Make music choices:** Select your first-dance songs, must-play songs or do-not-play songs.
  * **Take care of little touches:** Get your guest book, ring box, [personalized cocktail napkins](https://www.theknot.com/paper/ceremony-reception/napkins) and other little touches.
  * **Print remaining paper:** Print items like ceremony programs so you don't forget later on.



### Send Shower Invites

This wedding checklist task falls to the person hosting your shower. Now's the time to send out wedding shower invites, but since a shower is often hosted by the wedding party or family members, it's up to them to put the invitations in the mail.

### Create a Music Wish List

Most wedding DJs and bands will ask you for a list of must-play songs, as well as a do-not-play list too. Sit with your S.O. to talk about the songs you need to hear on your wedding day. Now's the time to pick a [first dance song](https://www.theknot.com/content/classic-first-dance-songs), any special dance tunes, your [processional](https://www.theknot.com/content/ceremony-processional-selections) and [recessional](https://www.theknot.com/content/ceremony-recessional-selections) songs, and more. Make sure to share these music requests in a timely manner so your pro has plenty of time to plan.

### Plan Personalized Details

Here's where you can really let your personality shine. Having a memorable wedding all comes down to the standout moments and details that will make your guests think, "Wow, that was so _them_." You can personalize just about everything and anything for your wedding, like vow books, bar menus, [personalized cocktail napkins](https://www.theknot.com/paper/ceremony-reception/napkins), signage, cups, toothpicks, napkins and even food packaging. (Custom french fry holders, anyone?) But, because custom details take time, you'll need a few months to design the details and have them delivered to you. "Sometimes couples wait to add these extra touches until the last minute and, sadly, that often means we can't create their exact vision or at all due to timeline limitations," says Emily Harpel, whose company, [Art of Sucre](https://artofsucre.com/), produces custom wedding cotton candy and drink glitter bombs. "When it comes to planning personalized details, I always say the earlier the better, but not later than four to three months before the big day."

### Finalize Your Ceremony Program

If you've opted to purchase ceremony programs for guests to read as you exchange vows, finalize the design and get it printed now. You'll want the complete booklet in your possession well before the wedding date, that way you aren't worried about printing any final paper goods in time.

## 3 Months Out From Wedding

Can you believe it? The end of the wedding checklist is in sight. With three months to go until your wedding day, this is what's most important on your wedding checklist timeline.

**3 months before wedding planning checklist at a glance:**

  * **Get thank-you gifts in order:** Buy gifts for your wedding party, each other, your officiant and anyone else you'd like to honor.   

  * **Schedule a hair and makeup trial:** Nail down your wedding beauty look well in advance.  

  * **Send your invitations:** Gather stamps, address envelopes and mail invitations this month.



### Attend Your Wedding Shower

Sit back, relax and enjoy your shower with your nearest and dearest. Assuming your wedding party or a few close family members banded together to host this event, you have nothing to do but to enjoy celebrating your upcoming wedding while being showered with love. Wedding showers typically fall between three months to a few weeks out from the wedding date, but you can enjoy this prewedding perk whenever it makes sense for your timeline.

### Purchase Thank-You Gifts

It's common for to-be-weds to purchase gifts for close family and wedding party members, and even your officiant in some cases. Not only is this a thoughtful way to thank them for having a role in your wedding, it serves as a token of appreciation for their time and help offered in the months leading up to the wedding. These gifts are often given on the wedding day, so start browsing now to find the perfect items that express your gratitude.

[Shop for Thank-You Gifts](https://www.theknot.com/content/thank-you-gifts-for-parents)

### Schedule Your Hair and Makeup Trial

Reach out to your stylist and makeup artist and schedule a glam trial. This wedding planning checklist item is essential because it'll help you finalize your wedding day look.

**The Knot Editor Tip:** "A hair and makeup trial is key so you can ensure you're on the same page as your glam team. This is your chance to see the style you've dreamt about in real life—and how it'll hold up throughout a day of dancing and crying," says [Hannah Nowack](https://www.theknot.com/content/author/hannah-nowack), The Knot Senior Manager of Content. "During your trial you should voice any concerns or specific requests you have."

[Prep for Your Trial](https://www.theknot.com/content/prep-for-hair-and-makeup-trial)

### Send Formal Wedding Invitations

Formal wedding invitations typically go in the mail two to three months before the wedding date. (Note: If you're hosting a destination wedding, these should be sent even earlier: four to six months in advance is ideal.) To ensure your stationery ends up in the hands of guests in a timely manner, we recommend sending them now to account for potential mail delivery delays. Earlier in the month, be sure to buy stamps and address envelopes. 

## 2 Months Out From Wedding

Looking for a two-month wedding checklist? We've got you covered with everything to tick off your wedding timeline checklist right here.

**2 months before wedding planning checklist at a glance:**

  * **Finish wedding attire alterations:** Your final fittings will take place from now until close to the wedding day.
  * **Attend your bach party:** Two months ahead is an ideal time for a bach party—plenty of time to recover before the wedding.
  * **Begin your vows:** Write down preliminary thoughts and a loose structure, at least. 



### Enjoy Your Bach Party

After all this planning, you deserve some R&R. Generally around this point of the wedding timeline, plan to embark on your bachelor or bachelorette party with your crew. Like the shower, this is often planned by a wedding party member. All you have to do is let loose and enjoy quality time with your closest friends.

### Start Writing Your Vows

We're big proponents of writing your vows early (read: not the night before the wedding). After all, the words you say at the altar are pretty important. Prevent any potential headaches or writer's block by starting early—that way, you have a lot of time built into your wedding preparation timeline to nail down exactly what you want to say.

[Get Expert Vow-Writing Advice](https://www.theknot.com/content/tips-for-writing-your-own-wedding-vows)

### Plan Your Favors and Welcome Bags

If you're going to surprise your guests with special gifts like [wedding favors](https://www.theknot.com/content/best-wedding-favor-ideas) or [welcome bags](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-welcome-bag), we recommend purchasing them now. While these extra add-ons aren't necessary, they are a nice touch if they fit in your budget. All of your gifts should be packed and ready to go about two months before the date. "Favors are a nice touch, but they are an added expense," says wedding planner Alyssa Pettinato, founder of [Alinato Events](https://www.alinato.com/). "I tell my couples to put them on the end of their budgeting list and explore it if leftover funds allow. Plan to purchase them roughly two months out to give time for shipping."

### Make Final Wedding Attire Alterations

At this point, ensure that your wedding day outfit is ready to go by finalizing your alterations. You'll need at least one month to work with a seamstress or tailor to make any necessary adjustments. 

"At a minimum, we recommend allowing at least four to six weeks for your alterations," says Heather McReynolds, VP, GMM for Bridal Dresses & Accessories at David's Bridal. "Do not wait until the last minute and rely on rush orders. Alterations are a craft." Speaking of your wedding look, you should also book any essential beauty appointments you need before the celebration, like manicures and haircuts.

## 1 Month Out From Wedding

It's the final countdown. You're one month out from your wedding day—hooray! This last month can feel overwhelming, so take a deep breath and take a peek at what's on your to-do list. Don't forget to take care of yourself too, because that's equally as important as tackling items on this The Knot checklist for your wedding.

**The Knot Editor Tip:** "As your final details come together, prioritize celebration and relaxation during the days immediately leading up to the wedding," advises Hannah Nowack. "Consider booking a spa day. You should also put a few date nights on the books where wedding planning talk is off-limits so you can simply relish time together."  
  
**1 month before wedding planning checklist at a glance:**

  * **Secure your marriage license:** You can't walk down the aisle without this important piece of paper.
  * **Assemble your seating chart:** Your final RSVPs have trickled in, seat everyone accordingly.
  * **Check in with attendants:** Ensure your wedding party's attire is all set. 



### Apply for a Marriage License

This is one of the most important month-of wedding checklist tasks to complete—after all, you can't get married without a marriage license. This legal document is your ticket to saying "I do." Once you know the municipality where your nuptials will take place, locate where you can obtain your license. This can be at city hall, the city or town clerk's office, or the marriage license bureau. Requirements vary by state, as do the timing deadlines. Some states require a several-day waiting period between granting the license and your nuptials taking place. Also, most marriage licenses are only valid for a window of time—anywhere between 10 days and a year—during which you must have the ceremony, sign the license (together with your officiant) and file for a certified license and marriage certificate. Start this process now to make sure your paperwork is ready to go.

### Confirm Wedding Party Attire Is Ready to Go

In the same vein, touch base with your wedding party and ask them to confirm that their outfits are ready as well. Any last-minute hems or adjustments should be handled now.

### Make Your Seating Chart

You'll need to pass your finalized seating chart off to your planner, day-of coordinator or the venue staff, so make sure you know exactly where everyone is sitting at this point in the planning process.

## 2 Weeks Out From Wedding

The end of this free wedding planning checklist (and your journey as an engaged person!) is just around the corner. With just two weeks left to go, here's what you need to focus on in your wedding planning checklist timeline.

**2 weeks before wedding planning checklist at a glance:**

  * **Confirm RSVPs:** Ensure all responses are present and accounted for.
  * **Meet with your planner and touch base with vendors:** Confirm small details like the hair and makeup schedule for the day with your vendor team.
  * **Finish your vows:** Tie a bow on your pledges to your soon-to-be spouse.



### Confirm All RSVPs

Do a final sweep to make sure you've got all RSVPs accounted for in this final phase of your wedding timeline planner. You'll need to give your venue a final headcount next week.

### Schedule a Final Meeting With Your Planner or Day-Of Coordinator

Now's a great time to touch base with your planner or day-of coordinator to go over your wedding day schedule and make any last-minute adjustments. Make sure you're on the same page about what's to come over the next two weeks.

### Give Your Shot List to Your Photographer

We always recommend having a list of photos you definitely want to take on the wedding day. Not only will this make our photoshoot session smooth and efficient, it'll ensure you get those "must-have" shots that you've been saving on Instagram and Pinterest. Hand over a shot list so your photographer has plenty of time to prepare themselves.

[Get the Ultimate Photo Shot List](https://www.theknot.com/content/great-wedding-photo-suggestions)

### Touch Base With Your Vendors

In addition to connecting with your planner and photographer, we also recommend reaching out to the rest of your pros too. It won't hurt to follow up and confirm that they're all set (and have what they need) for your wedding date.

### Share Your Music Requests

Remember those music requests you made a few months ago? Make sure your "must play" and "do not play" lists are passed off to your wedding DJ or band by now.

### Attend Final Beauty Appointments

If you want to have any final beauty appointments like a spray tan, a lash refill, a teeth whitening session, or a trusted facial, do so now. (If you're going to get a prewedding manicure or pedicure, save that for next week so your nails are nice and fresh.) It's important to note that now's not the time to try out a brand new treatment, though—the last thing you want is a facial that won't react well with your skin. Only book appointments you've had (and loved) before.

### Finalize Your Vows

Make sure those vows are in their final edits by this stage of the wedding planning timeline. You'll need to start practicing next week!

## The Week Before the Wedding

It's the home stretch. You have [one week until your wedding](https://www.theknot.com/content/week-of-wedding-planning-to-dos)! Take this moment to soak up all of the excitement—this is a big deal. Here are the last planning tasks to tie up before the day arrives.

If you have the ability, consider taking time off from work to focus your attention solely on wedding prep. Not only will this eliminate stress, it'll help you soak up the experience. "If you are able to take a few days off of work leading up to the wedding, that always helps take some pressure off and allow you to be fully present," suggests Tangerini.

**1 week before wedding planning checklist at a glance:**

  * **Give your final headcount:** Ensure your venue and caterer is prepped for the final number.
  * **Pack your bags and organize your personal care:** Double check everything is packed for the wedding weekend.
  * **Rehearse your ceremony:** Get the preliminary otters out at the rehearsal the day before. 



### Give Your Venue the Final Head Count

Get in touch with your venue and give them the [final wedding head count](https://www.theknot.com/content/when-should-we-give-the-wedding-caterer-our-head-count). They'll need this for planning purposes on their end.

### Press and Steam Your Outfit

Have your wedding dress or tux pressed and steamed. When you look back on photos, you'll be so grateful to see that you took the time to make sure your look was in pristine condition. After all, no one wants to sport wrinkles down the aisle.

### Confirm Timing With Your Vendors Again

Do a final touch-base with your wedding vendors to ensure everything is good to go for next week.

### Pack Your Overnight Bag

If you'll be spending your wedding night at a hotel or any location other than your home, you'll need to pack an overnight bag with the essentials (like a toothbrush and toothpaste, skincare, pajamas, a pillow, etc.) Now's also the time to pack your wedding purse, your [wedding day emergency kit](https://www.theknot.com/content/the-brides-emergency-kit), and a tote bag of any essentials you'll need with you on the big day.

### Clean Your Wedding Rings

Treat your wedding jewelry to the TLC it deserves. Your rings will be at the center of attention, so give them a deep clean so that they shine to their fullest potential.

[How to Clean Rings at Home](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-to-clean-diamond-ring-at-home)

### Practice Your Vows Out Loud

Practice makes perfect, so rehearse your vows out loud a few times. This is the best way to shake those prewedding jitters, especially if public speaking makes you nervous. Plus, with practice, your words will flow confidently once you're up on the altar.

### Write Your Partner a Day-Of Note and Package Their Gift

It's common for couples to write each other private notes to read on the wedding morning, so take care of that now. And, if you've decided to buy your S.O. a wedding day present, make sure it's packaged up and tucked in your day-of tote bag.

![Couple having fun at wedding reception](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/63417144-098a-4436-af4f-335d6d73e12d~rs_768.h-cr_292.0.3892.2700)

## The Day Before the Wedding

Can you believe it? Your wedding day is tomorrow! We're so excited for you. Before the party starts, here are the very last items on your wedding checklist.

**1 day before wedding planning checklist at a glance:**

  * **Get vendor payments and tips organized:** Divvy up cash in envelopes so it can be easily handed off.
  * **Hand off your marriage license:** Your officiant will file it for you properly.
  * **Give gifts to your family and wedding party:** The wedding day itself is busy, give thank-you gifts around the rehearsal dinner so you don't forget.



### Give Your Pros Day-Of Contact Information

Your pros already know how to contact you, but you'll be a little preoccupied tomorrow to answer last-minute texts or calls. Give them contact information for someone who can handle any logistical questions, like your maid of honor or best man, your parents, or your planner or day-of coordinator.

### Write Checks and Organize Tip Envelopes

It's customary to tip your pros for excellent service, so organize your cash now so that it's ready to be passed off to your vendors at the right time.

[Your Vendor Tipping Cheat Sheet](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-vendor-tipping-cheat-sheet)

### Hand Off Your Marriage Certificate

Once your marriage license has all necessary signatures, hand it over to your officiant. They're responsible for dropping it off to the county clerk by mail or in person. Once that's completed, you're all set! Keep an eye out for the certified copy in your mailbox.

### Give Gifts to Your Family and Wedding Party

Remember those thank-you gifts you purchased a few months ago? This is a great time to give them to your loved ones. Set aside some time for them to open their presents the night before the wedding.

### Bring Small Decor to Your Venue

If you're supplying any decor, like candles, signage or DIY accents, drop them off at your venue. We recommend calling ahead to make sure they're able to hold your decorations overnight.

### Rehearse Your Ceremony

Gather your crew and rehearse your wedding ceremony. Make sure to work through all logistical questions, and confirm that everyone is one the same page when it comes to timing, positions, and expectations. "Everyone needs to know when they are walking down the aisle, as well as what their cues will be and exactly where they will be standing," says Pettinato. "The logistics of the processional are important to understand, so attention should be spent telling everyone exactly when they need to go and to where."

### Pass Off Your Wedding Bands

While the best man traditionally holds the wedding rings during the ceremony, the choice is ultimately yours. Just make sure the right person gets the rings the day before the wedding and keeps them in a safe place until the actual ceremony.

### Enjoy Your Rehearsal Dinner

Now it's time to party! Once the "rehearsal" part of the evening is over, enjoy dinner with your nearest and dearest. This is the true kickoff to your wedding festivities.

## The Day Of the Wedding

It's time to celebrate—you finally made it! After so many long months of planning, your wedding day is finally here. Relax and enjoy every minute of your special day. "Once you get to the day of your wedding, have fun and take it all in," Tangerini says. "You have spent months planning and preparing, so let your vendor team take care of everything for you that day. They are professionals and know what they are doing!"

## After the Wedding

Congrats...you're married! Give yourself a pat on the back. After many long months of planning, your hard work has paid off. But, believe it or not, there are a few things on your postwedding to-do list. From writing vendor reviews to sending thank-you notes and, yes, enjoying your well-earned honeymoon, here's a guide of what you should [accomplish after the wedding day](https://www.theknot.com/content/post-wedding-to-dos).
