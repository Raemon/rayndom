In the end, they delivered unique, cinematic videos that were perfectly catered to our personality as a couple and the style of our wedding.

m and we are SO grateful we went with Killer Creations. They are absolute professionals when it comes to handling a destination wedding and I never once felt concerned or stressed about their role in our special day/weekend. We met them in person for the first time in Jamaica and it felt like meeting old friends - they were incredibly easy to work with and had already scoped out multiple locations and had been filming/photographing scenic shots for us. They set up a wedding day time line for us and were incredibly efficient and on time the entire wedding day - they had everything in place and all we had to do was show up and smile! They are masters at making you forget they are there, so I felt like our video was authentic in that they captured the moments as they happened and we were able to have genuine reactions to things without feeling like we were being filmed or photographed. It really took a huge stress off us that we didn't have to think twice about the photos and video as they took care of it all. I honestly cannot say enough good things about our experience working with Killer Creations - if you are like we were and are going through tons of different pages and options trying to find the perfect fit for your wedding day, let me save you some time - you won't find anyone better for your wedding day than the team at Killer Creations.

felt like we had a very high bar for the team at Killer to hit in terms of what they shot and how the video was edited — and I’m happy to say that we always felt heard and were thrilled with our videos! The team offers a diverse catalogue of video styles and allowed us to point to some of our favorites so they could target a creative edit that matched the style of our wedding. Everything from logistics planning with Sydney, in coordination with our planner, to the team on that shot us on the day-of, we only have great things to say about everyone involved. Killer’s team got along great with our Wedding Photography team as well, never felt intrusive, and really supported us throughout the day. We’re so happy with our videos and if you decide to go with Killer, I’d bet you would be too!

ere and how they split up to cover more ground in a short amount of time. They even coordinated shots with our photographer (separate from KC), which resulted in no one blocking or inconveniencing each other and allowed for crossover images in both photos and video (i.e. we got to see the moment through still images and video capture), which we really enjoyed! It was also reassuring that their sales/project manager, Sydney, who we had been in contact with throughout the whole process, was available to us if we ever needed anything. :) When we received the post-production edits (feature film, speeches, ceremony, etc.), we were completely blown away by how beautifully they told our story. They delivered a touching video that still had an energetic flow to it. We've watched it a million times already and we've only been married 6 months! Overall, we were really impressed with the KC team's professionalism, communication, and efforts to give us a product that will help us relive our wedding day for the years to come!

eam at KC were amazing to work with and helped us easily reschedule for a year later. We are very thankful for that as it took a lot of stress off of our shoulders. Fast forward a year, we had what we like to call, an "adventure wedding". Our goal was a small destination wedding in the mountains of Montana with Killer Creations by our side filming and enjoying every moment. From Army truck rides up to a remote yurt for dinner, disc golfing at Big Sky, extremely dusty and dirty ATV adventures with incredible views of Lone Peak, to getting married at 8800ft overlooking the beautiful mountains of Montana, they captured it all. I was able to see some sneak previews and clips and everything looks incredible. My wife and I watched just about every edit KC had on their website and Instagram page and we knew that they were the crew for us. The videographers, Jonathan and Tommy, were both amazing and we definitely enjoyed their company. I felt like they were part of the crew and they brought a lot of positive energy that we all really enjoyed. I can't say enough good things about Killer Creations, Sydney, Jonathan and Tommy, you guys were awesome in every way possible we are truly thankful for that! Nick & Tamiko

We had the pleasure of having Killer Creations (KC) capture our wedding videos back in April. From the very first point of contact with Sydney, we knew we were in the right hands. ...

KC’s professionalism carried throughout the initial interactions to final delivery of our footage. We spent some extra time getting to know Jason through our pre-wedding shoot and instantly felt comfortable expressing our wishes to him. Both Jason and Johnathon did an incredible job capturing the most important details of our wedding while blending seamlessly into the events. The Same Day Edit the team delivered was phenomenal as well and many of our guests asked us for KC’s contact info (some are using them at their wedding, too!). Can’t recommend this team enough.

hotos. It was a very smooth process. The only cons that I unfortunately want to mention are that there are no "sneak peek" photos which seem to be a trend that most other photographers do provide. Also, the timeline for your photographs are 60 days, this is how long it took to get even one photo (and they were about a week past contract). If you are a patient bride, their high quality work is worth the wait.

ently took photos with a smile. He knew how to make the kids smile, so the pics are great. He took all the photos on our list with ease. During the first look, he ensured we got great shots. He also had a drone! We loved working with Mike, and he is my go-to photo guy now.

preciated all the details of what Johnathan and Jason were capturing, from arriving the previous night to take some shots of the surroundings, to the stunning drone footage, and multi-camera views of the wedding and reception that really captured the energy of that day. Every choice of color, lighting, and music come together effortlessly. We are a gay couple and it must be noted how welcoming we felt from the second we chatted on the phone, so if you're an LGBTQ couple look no further. Thank you guys for everything.

Killer Creations is the only way to go! From the moment I met with Mike at a local coffee shop, I knew I wanted to work with his team! I could tell that he was passionate, talented...

and truly cared about making the client happy. We had Ilgar and another videographer on our wedding Day and they were more than amazing! Ilgar had a vision and managed to capture every little detail as well as the most important moments of our special day! The entire booking/planning process was a breeze and Mike was always extremely responsive and prompt In answering any and all questions! Thank you again!!

If you’re reading endless reviews searching for a videographer that is tasteful, unique, and has that unmistakeable “X Factor” that separates your wedding video apart from every ot...

her videographer - well, you’ve found your people at Killer Creations. My wife and I hired Killer Creations for our wedding cinematography one month after our engagement. We found them on a wedding website along with a few other videographers with strong reputations. Killer Creations was my “dream” videographer. Their end product is CLEARLY leaps and bounds better than your average cookie cutter videographer. However, I was positive I couldn’t afford them. I almost decided to abandon the idea of even calling, expecting them to be wildly out of my price range. So my wedding planner decided to call for me to see what the deal was. She called me IMMEDIATELY telling me “you HAVE to book these people”. KC was not only the clear leader in quality and taste, but also (amazingly) affordable and within our budget! You can ask my wife - out of all of the details of the wedding, having Killer Creations on site to film our special day was my highlight. They over-delivered on an INCREDIBLE edit of three different video lengths. The footage, editing, audio, and overall production are simply stunning. We have received so many compliments from friends and family. But most importantly, they beautifully captured our special day that, with the help of this amazing video set, we will never forget. We give Killer Creations a whole-hearted, 100% recommendation. Getting married is a deeply personal, intimate, exciting, and scary life event. When you make the leap, you will never regret having a videographer like Killer Creations documenting every moment.

pecial day. They were so great to work with from beginning to end- seriously though, really nice and professional team. I highly recommend doing a pre-wedding "love story" like we did to air at your rehearsal din or reception! We shared ours and our guests really enjoyed it. Our 1min highlight reel, 5min feature film and wedding documentary also blew us away. So happy we have these films to forever remember these beautiful memories that were captured so perfectly!

At no point in the day did I feel tired or cheesy taking photos with Mike. Besides his talent, he is a genuinely great guy and wonderful to work with. Mike will also help create thet timeline and schedule for your big day to make sure it runs smoothly.

special day. Michael Kubert and Mike Peraino both did a fantastic job filming our morning, our ceremony, and the reception. Here's a few things that we felt were extremely helpful and beneficial to our experience. Both videographers were warm, comfortable, and flexible. Getting ready for both of us was a bit hectic but these guys remained calmed and new exactly what footage they needed to help accent our preparations. Their filming was very inconspicuous and we didn't notice them at all. Their cameras were small and discrete and these guys new where to be at the right times. They kept us on schedule with everything and made sure they had covered everything we wanted. They are clearly dedicated to their work and this is reflected in both their final product and their communication. Finally, they are genuinely great guys! Thank you so much Michael and Mike!

re very last minute on our engagement photos (which were free in the package), but Mike promptly took some incredible shots, and had the album ready by the next day. This was awesome because we had these amazing photos on display during our entire wedding week. On Wedding day, his team of four were excellent professionals and were so easy and comfortable to work with throughout the day. Amongst the craziness of the entire wedding day, my wife and I lost our ride from one event to the next. Mike's team gave us a lift, and saved us so much time and distress. They seriously went above and beyond what their service was supposed to offered. Speaking of their service, we have only been getting compliments from everyone about the photos from the engagement photo shoot and the wedding day events. They have an incredible eye for absolutely unique shots, with so much creativity and diversity in their photos. We cannot wait to see the video production of our wedding day that they are still working on. We highly recommend them from their impeccable customer satisfaction to their outstanding photography and videography services. Thanks so much to you, Mike, and the rest of your team!
