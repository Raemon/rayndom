## Average Cost of Wedding Flowers

According to [The Knot 2025 Real Weddings Study](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-data-insights/real-weddings-study), the average cost of wedding flowers in last year was $2,723 overall. This number bundles in the cost of wedding bouquets, the average cost of wedding party flowers, the average cost of boutonniere and average cost of floral wedding centerpieces.But just because this number is the average, doesn't mean it's necessarily the standard for the wedding florals you're used to seeing. "This budget would cover personal flowers, a very simple statement piece for the ceremony and simple centerpieces," says Robyn Hunter of [Songbird Floristry](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/songbird-floristry-sherwood-or-2016584) in Portland, Oregon.

Factors like wedding region, time of year, guest count and whether a couple opted for a local or destination wedding all affected the cost of flowers for a wedding. Couples who wed in the Mid-Atlantic spent the most on their wedding blooms, with an average cost of $3,457, followed by the Northeast/New England at $2,969, the Southwest at $2,821 and the South/Southeast at $2,734—all above the national average. The Midwest dipped below it at $2,424, and the West had the lowest average prices for wedding flowers at $2,402. The order of these prices feel relatively in line with the cost of living for each region, but if we peek at the average wedding flower cost by time of year, the results prove more surprising. 

FEATURED VIDEO FROM THE KNOT

Pairs who said "I do" from January through March actually spent the most on their blooms on average at $2,803 despite marrying in what's usually considered the "off season." This season was followed by nuptials that took place from October through December at $2,742, then weddings in April through June at $2,737 and lastly celebrations that unfolded from July through September costing the least at $2,698. Seasonality and the ability to source locally might come into play here, since flowers may have to be shipped in from afar during winter months, whereas the summer season could see more options grown close to home. 

The [average wedding cost](https://www.theknot.com/content/average-wedding-cost) for florals increased with the length of a wedding's guest list, with weddings with over 100 attendees coming in at $3,282. This makes sense, given the greater venue square footage to cover in blooms. "The larger the guest count, the more table decor is needed," says Hunter. "Also, aisle decor generally increases with guest count as more rows of chairs are required."

There was also a price increase the further the nuptials were from a couple's home, with destination wedding flowers averaging out at $3,000 and hometown wedding flowers at $2,658. Additionally, Millennials spent above the overall national average cost at $3,008, while Gen Z and Gen X both spent below it: $2,360 and $1,943, respectively. Regardless of these numbers, you should draw up some [questions to ask potential florists](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-florist-questions-before-hiring) to ensure your expectations are realistic. 

"It's important to be realistic with your floral budget so you know what that budget will give you," says floral designer Yumiko Fletcher of [Hana Floral Design](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/hana-floral-design-mystic-ct-292738) in Mystic, Connecticut. "The industry standard has always been that floral is roughly 10% of your overall wedding budget, so a couple having a $75,000 wedding should assume their florals are in the $7,500 range. But if you have high expectations and flowers are a priority for your big day, then perhaps you really need to allocate 15% because today's $7,500 is not the same as two years ago."

## Wedding Flower Cost Factors

As we've established, how much wedding flowers will cost fluctuates based on the types of blossoms you want, your wedding season, the style of the arrangements and other factors. But one thing stays consistent: Price proved to be the number-one deciding factor when choosing their wedding florist (71% said it was their top priority). Here are a few elements to keep in mind as you plan out some strategies for [saving money on wedding flowers](https://www.theknot.com/content/save-money-on-wedding-flowers):

### Find your kind of venue

From barns to ballrooms, discover reception venues that feel like you.

### Ratio of Blooms to Greenery

"Flowers are almost always more per stem than a stem of greens; however, this doesn't mean greens are cheap by any means," says Fletcher. "If you prefer a very floral-heavy arrangement for your centerpieces with little to no greenery, this is naturally going to cost more. So even adding greenery will help fill in spaces and help save money." Trendy options like branches or can transform any venue, and [using more greenery](https://www.theknot.com/content/greenery-centerpiece-ideas) than expensive flowers can help you get [wedding flowers on a budget](https://www.theknot.com/content/top-ten-inexpensive-flowers) in general, depending on the type.

### Fresh Flowers vs. Dried Botanicals

Some couples choose to line their ceremony aisle and reception venue with hundreds of fresh flowers. If that's the look you envision for your wedding, expect to pay well over $2,723. But if fresh blooms aren't on the top of your must-have list, there are plenty of alternatives to decorate your space without going over your wedding flower budget. For example, dried baby's breath, which is a great inexpensive option if you're trying to stick to a strict and [detailed wedding budget](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-budget-ways-to-save-money), can be spray painted in all manner of funky hues to match your color palette. 

### Size, Scale and Number of Arrangements

High-impact floral installations (especially in unexpected places) are one of the [latest wedding flower trends](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-flower-trends). Therefore, you might be looking into larger centerpieces and additional arrangements to adorn areas like your aisle, reception entry and even the ceiling of your venue. Of course, larger florals and more elaborate arrangements (think: arches, flower clouds, etc.) will have a higher price tag. And the more arrangements you want, the higher the cost. 

"A simple arbor floral piece could start at a few hundred dollars and quickly scale up to several thousand based on how much of the structure is covered, and the ratio of flowers to foliage," says Hunter. "Higher budget weddings also tend to include fun things like statement pieces to accompany signage and the bar, and often enhancements to the structure of the venue like tent pole or ceiling greening, floral on lighting, or suspended focal pieces in the reception space." All in all, getting some [tips for hiring a florist](https://www.theknot.com/content/steps-to-finding-wedding-florist) will be just as important as ever, since these pros can help you save money (and time) by eliminating the guesswork of sourcing flowers on your own. Our survey found that 60% of couples included a florist in their lineup of wedding vendors (and it was definitely worth it).

### Seasonality of Your Flowers

Selecting your [wedding flowers by season](https://www.theknot.com/content/your-guide-to-wedding-flowers) can also help to reduce some of the cost. Says Fletcher: "If flowering branches are a must for you, then those are only available in the spring months. If you love dahlias, then summer into fall weddings makes the most sense. Ask your florist what's in season for your wedding and let them go to local growers to source some pretty stems for you." Though, certain unexpected harsh weather conditions can make some seasonal blooms more scarce and therefore cost more. Your florist will flag that with you if that's the case with one of your chosen blossoms.

### Cleaning, Prep and Storage 

Hunter notes that the prep work to get flowers usable plays a role when it comes to how much wedding flowers are. There's removing packaging, stripping foliage and thorns and getting a fresh cut on every stem. Plus, assessing and applying special hydrating solutions as needed, placing them in clean buckets of treated water and refrigerating as needed for all stems to reach peak perfection on the event date. "[Wedding flower costs also include] containers and other hard goods, consultation with the client to gather requirements, recipe creation and supply ordering—including delivery vehicles, drivers and time," says Hunter. "And an inordinate amount of time to clean: wash buckets, sweep refuse, get the wax and soot off of the candles, clean all of the vessels. So. Much. Cleaning."

### Level of Logistics

It takes time and energy for a pro to conceptualize designs for your arrangements and bouquets, source flowers, assemble each piece and deliver them to your venue. More elaborate designs that require additional materials will fetch a higher price, while standard shapes will be more budget friendly. If your venue is far away from the florist or otherwise difficult to access, it'll cost more to move the flowers from point A to point B. Likewise, if the florist has to spend time installing an arrangement (like a floral cloud) at the venue, their time will come into play in the final number.

## How Much Have Wedding Flower Costs Changed Over the Years?

The average cost of wedding flowers in 2024 has slightly decreased since the prior year (by a slim 3%)—2023 saw a 17% increase from 2022 and a 22% increase compared to 2021, when the average cost was $2,300. Prepandemic, wedding flower costs were $2,000 in 2019 and prior to that, below $2,000 consistently. From supply chain shortages to shipping issues, it's no surprise the cost rose a few hundred dollars. 

Keep in mind that $2,723 is the _national average_ cost of wedding flowers and centerpieces, with an emphasis on both words. If you're having a smaller wedding that requires fewer flower arrangements, you may end up paying less. On the other hand, if you're having a luxury wedding or want elaborate arrangements with flowers that are in high demand, the average flower budget for a wedding of that scale will be more.

Vendor and venue packages can also influence what the average cost of flowers for a wedding is. [All-inclusive wedding venues](https://www.theknot.com/content/all-inclusive-wedding-venue) with in-house floral designers may create corresponding table centerpieces, boutonnieres, bridesmaid bouquets, corsages and floral decor as part of their price offering. While $2,723 serves as a general price, the average cost of wedding flowers can fluctuate based on volume of stems and the complexity of your order.

The bottom line: Don't get caught up asking yourself "[why are wedding flowers so expensive](https://www.theknot.com/content/why-are-wedding-flowers-so-costly)?" or getting concerned over [who pays for wedding flowers](https://www.theknot.com/content/who-pays-forwedding-flowers). The right number for you all depends on what you and your partner consider to be most important, whether it fits with the average floral budget for a wedding or not. Though it would be an added cost to decorate with trendy or rare flowers instead of blooms that are more easily sourced, you may decide that it's worth it from a personalization standpoint.

As you work with your florist during the wedding planning process, flexibility and trust are key these days. "Couples need to think of their needs versus their wants," Fletcher says. "Make sure you communicate with your florist what these items are and prioritize the needs first, the wants second if budget allows. Be flexible with the types of flowers. Tell your florist your color palette and overall wedding style and let them buy accordingly."

## What Might Influence Wedding Flower Costs In the Future?

While there's been a clear rise in the cost of flowers for a wedding on the couple side in recent years, higher prices are hitting florists too. "Higher prices, as we have experienced for other reasons over the last five years, cause a major strain," says Hunter. "Prices will have to increase and it will impact everyone involved. Many florists will struggle to pass on the price increase in full to clients, especially those occupying the lower ranges in the market where the margins are already the tightest." 

Hunter also notes that market uncertainty is a significant factor that makes the future cost of wedding flowers fuzzy, especially with so much unpredictability on the horizon with [tariffs and trade policy](https://www.theknot.com/content/financial-anxiety). "For example, if prices are set in a floral contract at booking in November then supply costs sky rocket in July when it's time to actually buy fresh flowers, it's really hard to retain a profit and stay in business," says Hunter. For example, if a set of wedding flowers contained roses sourced from Columbia, the florist would have to incur a 25% tariff on those flowers in addition to the base cost of the blooms—not to mention the upcharge for hard goods, like vases and such, shipped in from regions with tariffs. Altogether, potential tariffs could cut into the budget a florist would have originally earned by half.

"Many florists will try to split the difference, reducing their profit in order to still provide a product that they feel good about and staying in the market for couples in that $2700 price range," says Hunter. "Other florists will hold the boundary and couples will get a lot less for what they previously could have gotten with that $2700 budget. While I do hope for many reasons that local and American grown flowers continue to increase in popularity, I would also suggest that the cost of domestic production will likely also increase." Though given the global supply chain, many pieces of equipment and inputs for domestic farming, like vehicles, tractors, fertilizer, fuel, etc., would also be impacted. 

Regardless of how the average cost of wedding flowers might shift in the future, a wedding is a gateway to a marriage, and that's always important to remember: "While Pinterest and social media do a convincing job of making a luxury event with every possible detail designed to the maximum degree seem normal, there are lots of ways to plan a wedding that culminates in a marriage, and to do so within one's means," says Hunter. "That said, we love a luxury wedding and really hope costs stabilize so we can continue making inspired floral art to celebrate the milestone of marriage."
