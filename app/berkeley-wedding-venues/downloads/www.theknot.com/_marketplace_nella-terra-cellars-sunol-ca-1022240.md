nd so well-executed thanks to the incredible team that helped bring it all together. Kendall and Whitney from Nella Terra were so responsive and kind throughout the planning process. They answered every question, big or small, and made us feel confident and supported every step of the way. The venue itself is breathtaking—rolling vineyards, lush greenery, and in May, the weather was absolutely perfect. It felt like something out of a fairytale. One of the things that stood out the most to us (and to all our friends and family) was just how fun and stress-free the entire day felt. Everyone had such a great time, and it was clear how much care and coordination went into making it all happen. Thank you to everyone at Nella Terra team for helping us create such a beautiful, meaningful, and unforgettable day. We’re so grateful!

g down the hills, a breathtaking outdoor ceremony space, and a grand staircase that makes for the most incredible bridal entrance. During sunset, we took photos overlooking the rolling hills, and it felt like we were in another world — even though it’s only about 30 minutes from home! We first met Whitney during our tour, and she instantly made us feel welcomed and taken care of. She was punctual, kind, and so helpful throughout the entire planning process. Whitney stayed on top of everything — from reminder emails to quick responses — and truly made wedding planning feel smooth and stress-free. Booking Nella Terra also meant working with Simply Lovely Events and On The Vine Catering, which was an amazing bonus. Lindsay from Simply Lovely was phenomenal — she helped us through every detail and made our day so special. The catering team was just as great. Their tasting was delicious, and the food on our wedding day exceeded expectations. The bridal cottage and groom’s area were great for pre-wedding moments and photos. While you can’t get fully ready in the bridal cottage, it was the perfect spot for final touches before the ceremony. Our guests couldn’t stop talking about how beautiful the venue was! The drive in is a bit winding, so we arranged for bus transportation — which worked out perfectly. There’s also plenty of parking for those who drive themselves. I can’t recommend Nella Terra Cellars enough. They know what they’re doing and do it exceptionally well. Every single detail came together seamlessly, and we’ll look back on our wedding day forever with full hearts and huge smiles.

Her and our team of vendors are truly superheroes! Nella Terra was the first venue we toured and we knew right away, it was the one. In September, the hills turn this gorgeous golden color and we took photos during sunset. The venue really speaks for itself and Nella Terra's team is incredibly skilled and coordinated. I couldn't imagine our wedding coming together like it did without their support!

Being a wedding coordinator, I'm always pleasantly surprised when a client brings ME a stellar vendor. Nella Terra Cellars not only ticks all the best venue boxes (professionalism,...

incredible food and beverage, excellent staff, flexibility, plenty of event space, everything you need...), but they are also special. The Bay Area is saturated with wedding venues...but Nella Terra is special in that it's family-owned and operated...it's location is beautiful and unique...their clients are treated like family. Their level of service competes with 5-star venues but without the corporate feel. The biggest thing is, you can trust them with your vision, and they care about your guest experience. If you're in the market for a venue, book yourself a wine tasting to check it out and meet them. You won't be disappointed.

Also, special call out for the Bridal Cottage, it was so beautiful (newly renovated) and such a great home base for the Bride and Bridal Party. The Reception Tent provided the most beautiful diffused lighting during daylight and a romantic, moody, ambience for the dance floor in the evening.

They also have a solid variety of preferred vendors to choose from. Our guests all had an amazing time and loved our venue. Nella Terra was our hidden gem in the Bay Area and we were so excited to share it with all of our loved ones. All of our guests were in awe of our wedding and could not stop talking about how beautiful the venue was. The walk down the stairs is something the guests cannot stop talking about.

There were so many great photo spots by the vines, the staircase, the pond, and so much more. All of my guests asked me how I was able to find this venue. It was a very pleasant surprise for them to see there is such a lovely winery nearby (no need to go all the way to Napa). To top it all off, the team at Nella Terra is just awesome. Whitney was so patient with me with my million questions and was super helpful in making decisions from the different customizable options that the venue provides. Thank you for making me the happiest bride on my wedding day. (OH and the wines are so yummy too - my most wine savvy friends all enjoyed them!!).

If you are looking for a winery to have the perfect wedding, this is the place. The first time we walked onto this venue we knew this is where we wanted to tie the knot. The team ...

that runs Nella Terra communicates well and just fantastic to work with. They have a list of preferred vendors that they have already worked with and honestly that saves so much time trying to find reliable companies to work with. The wedding venue is stunning and holds 150+ people. Or wedding day was even better than we imagined! When we first stepped onto the property we were just in awe with how beautiful it was. Kendall gave us a tour and we had plenty of questions that she was more than happy to answer. Our main question was the best month to get married which she told us June. So we chose June 17th, 2023. During June the grapevines are full of color that coexists with the beautiful golden hills that surrounds the property. This gives you the best of both worlds for amazing photo opportunities. The ceremony area is magical with tons of seats to fit a large party. It has a pergola that can be filled with flowers and has a beautiful pond and garden in the background. The Grooms getting ready area has a fun bocci court and shed that was filled with glasses and champagne while the Brides get a beautiful cottage that was freshly remodeled with beautiful décor. The brides cottage has a kitchen, huge bathroom and getting ready room. They have a huge tent for the reception which was a perfect choice during covid. The tent can be decorated with drapery which makes the whole place come together and would highly recommend. The venue provides a shuttle that goes around the property from and to the parking lot to the ceremony/reception area which was a huge benefit for our grandparents and guests with less mobility. I cannot express enough how perfect our wedding was and we look forward to going back and enjoying Nella Terra's award winning wines. Thank you Nella Terra for hosting us!

We were really impressed with how smoothly everything ran, including the rehearsal/walk through and all the communication leading up to the big day. The venue has some of the best photography scenery I have seen, with lots of different spots for photos for the bride and groom and also for their guests. All our guests have been raving about how beautiful everything was, including the tent. The bridal cottage is great for getting ready and is the perfect place to gather the bridal party together before the ceremony for photos and champagne. I can't recommend Nella Terra enough as a wedding venue, having our wedding there was worth the wait and it truly was the best day.

is lush. Food was extremely important to us, and while the caterer's food at our tasting was wonderful, it's only natural to be skeptical that it will be just as good on the wedding day, and yet it absolutely was (get the tri-tip carving station!). All of our guests had a great time and were blown away by the natural beauty of the venue, which was also a tremendous asset for our photographer - our sunset photos in front of the rolling golden hills look incredible. The venue had someone on-site during the day-of to make sure the groomsmen and bridesmaids had everything they needed, and to help ensure the whole thing went off without a hitch (thanks Bella!). Finally, the associated planner/coordinator, Simply Lovely Events, were phenomenal to work with (we relied on them heavily since we were planning from the other side of the country) and ran everything smoothly on the big day.

They say finding a venue for your wedding is the most difficult decision but ours was rather easy once we toured Nella Terra! We toured countless number of wedding venues all over ...

the Bay Area and we were slowly losing hope of finding our perfect venue. Then we found Nella Terra and was instantly in love with the venue! As gorgeous as the venue is, the people at Nella Terra were amazing to work with and made us feel like they really cared to make our wedding as memorable as possible. Shoutout to Bella and Whitney for all of your amazing help throughout the process. Moreover, their preferred vendors were absolutely amazing. We were actually somewhat hesitant to use their preferred vendors since we had other vendors in mind but we can't have made a better choice (Huge thanks to our wedding coordinators Lindsay, Olivia and Tannya!). As daunting a task it is to plan a wedding for 200+ guests, everyone we worked with made our planning so much easier. I can honestly say that after our wedding, all our guests told us how amazing the venue was. We'll definitely be back to Nella Terra to enjoy their delicious wines!
