## How Much Does a Wedding DJ Cost?

While the average DJ cost for a wedding does vary, the average amount couples spent in this category last year was $1,689 according to [The Knot 2025 Real Weddings Study](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-data-insights/real-weddings-study), which polled nearly 17,000 couples. If you want a huge variety of genres, sounds and artists at your reception, a wedding DJ is an excellent option. Around 70% of couples chose to hire a wedding DJ last year. 

Of course, the wedding DJ prices you could end up paying will depend on how long you book the DJ for, among other factors. (Will the DJ play music during the wedding ceremony and cocktail hour? Will they double as a [wedding MC](https://www.theknot.com/content/is-professional-wedding-mc-necessary)?). Plus, the number of DJs and amount of equipment required. Wedding DJs typically cost less than a live band, as this service typically only requires one or two people. Where you're getting married also has an impact on a DJ's price range. Mid-Atlantic couples spent the most on a DJ ($2,371), followed by the Northeast/New England at $2,117. Couples in the South, Southeast, Southwest and Midwest spent between $1,300 and $1,700.

No matter where a couple is based, price came in as the primary decision-making methodology for couples according to our data. "Price comes into play for all wedding professionals at some point; for us, it typically is the driver for couples who may not have done their homework on what's possible or who do not totally understand the value of an excellent entertainment resource and its impact on their celebration," says Jason Jani, DJ and founder of the New Jersey-based [SCE Event Group](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/sce-event-group-farmingdale-nj-370314), which specializes in boutique and production-based wedding entertainment. "It's about using music, technology and entertainment production to shift the emotional fabric of a wedding, making it incredibly impactful on the people who are there to celebrate." 

DJ prices for a wedding peaked from July through September, and bottomed out from January through March. Additionally, the longer the guest list, the higher the average cost of a DJ at a wedding. Still, every DJ (and DJ company) is different and has different pricing—so it's best to ask "how much is a DJ for a wedding" to every vendor individually and brush up on some [tips for hiring a DJ](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-dj-hire) before you book. 

We'll end this section with one of our most interesting findings when it comes to wedding DJ rates: Millennials spent the most on wedding DJs on average compared to Gen X and Gen Z couples, over the national average. This tracks for Jani: "Millennials have become accustomed to DJ experiences and talent; they grew up in a time when the DJ has become an important element of culture," he says. "Over the past 10 to 15 years, the popularity of DJs has continued to increase and become more of a staple in experiences from concerts to nightlife, to dining and shopping, and in TV, movies and more."

## How Much Does a Live Wedding Band Cost?

According to The Knot 2025 Real Weddings Study, the average cost for a live wedding band costs $4,475. A live wedding band provides guests with an extremely memorable experience during your celebration, but will come at a higher price. Wedding-specific bands have a special finesse and know how to work a room, which is why one of our top [tips for finding a live band](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-band-hire) is to always check that the group has plenty of experience at weddings in particular, not just on stage. 

How much a wedding band should cost does depend on a multitude of factors, such as number of band members, hours booked and equipment required. "Bands are typically more expensive for a few reasons, they have more overhead costs (band members, booking agents, equipment, etc.)," says Hailey Keyees of [Simply Golden Events](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/simply-golden-events-brentwood-tn-2026256) in Nashville. "You not only have to take into account the event time frame, but also the time to practice and learn specific songs that the couple may request. Many bands also have to employ sound techs and stage crew, which can add to the overall cost."

While the price tag may be higher than the average DJ cost for a wedding, couples still love to have live bands at their wedding. Per our data, 12% of couples who wed last year had a live band play at their reception, though that does vary by region. And again, millennials are spending the most in terms of cost for a wedding band: "Millennials value authentic, personalized experiences, and live music brings a unique, personal touch to their weddings," says Madison Hernandez, of the Colorado-based [Vignette Artists](https://www.vignetteartists.com/). "Additionally, nostalgia for live performances at family events and weddings may inspire this generation to carry on the tradition."

## Wedding DJ and Live Band Cost Factors

The answers to "how much does a DJ cost for a wedding?" and "how much does a live band cost for a wedding?" are more than just a number. There are numerous factors that come into play. See what might make or break your [affordable wedding music](https://www.theknot.com/content/save-money-on-wedding-music) below: 

### Number of Hours

The longer your band or DJ performs, the higher the cost, especially if the overall amount of hours includes music for the ceremony or after-party. As aforementioned, the price of music for even a standard wedding reception will vary depending on your location. For four hours, a basic wedding DJ from Jani's SCE Events Group will charge around double our reported national average as a starting price (roughly $3,200). This number would rise for DJs performing five hours or more. For our average cost of a wedding band amount, Hernandez motes that couples can typically expect to book a 4- to 6-piece live band for a 4- to 6-hour performance, including basic sound and lighting equipment as well as travel fees within a specific region.

### More Musicians or Special Skills

Larger receptions might require larger live bands, thus increasing live wedding band prices overall. And if there's a specialty musician you might want to add into your live band (perhaps a saxophonist to handle a solo in a requested song), that would bump up the rate as well. DJ-wise, Jani notes that DJs that possess a special skill or talent, like if a couple is focused on [hiring a bilingual wedding DJ](https://www.theknot.com/content/bilingual-wedding-dj), could heighten the rate too.

### Travel Fees

If you get your heart set on a wedding DJ or live band and aren't marrying where they're based, a travel fee will likely be bundled into your overall cost. This could be reflected in our data, as couples who chose to throw destination weddings, both domestic and international, spent more than pairs who said "I do" locally. According to Hernandez, the higher destination wedding cost could also be attributed to this reason: "The higher spending often reflects the desire to make the event extraordinary, with couples willing to invest in premium entertainment to create a truly memorable experience," she says.

### Sound, Lighting and Equipment

"Larger guest lists often require bigger sound systems and potentially a larger band to ensure everyone is engaged," says Hernandez. The same goes for wedding DJs. If a wedding venue is large, wedding DJs and live bands will likely need to bring in more lighting, speakers, extension cords, etc. to ensure they're set up properly. 

### Custom Requests or Additions

Any customizations or extra additions will unsurprisingly up your wedding live band cost or DJ cost. Live bands may charge more for any custom song requests, given the extra time it would take to compose the arrangement and to practice, while DJs would up their price for any services like an on-site photobooth (a popular offering for DJ companies) or a "cloud" or "snowfall" treatment for a first dance, which would involve specialty equipment like a fog machine.

## A Look Back at Wedding DJ Cost and Wedding Band Cost

According to our data, there is a 2% decrease between how much DJs cost for weddings last year and in 2023. The 2023 cost was $1,700, the 2022 cost $1,500 and the 2021 cost $1,400. From 2016 through 2019, the average cost of a DJ was around $1,200. Costs have increased overall slightly in recent years due to inflation and high demand across the wedding industry.

However, most couples deem having a wedding DJ a worthy expense. With a great DJ, you can rock out to your favorite '90s throwback, your current pop obsession, hit [wedding reception songs](https://www.theknot.com/content/billboard-most-popular-wedding-songs) and your extra-special first dance song all with one vendor.

"Many DJs bring their own equipment, so they have to be able to cover the cost of the equipment and the time it takes to curate music for each client's event," says Keiana Hastings, also a wedding planner at Simply Golden Events in Nashville. "Many DJs today offer much more than just music and emcee services, they offer photobooths, uplighting, sparklers, etc. All of which have costs associated with operations. The DJ is also critical when it comes to keeping things on schedule, making announcements and keeping guests engaged. They are so much more than someone who is playing a playlist. A good wedding DJ knows how a wedding processional should flow, they know when to transition music, adjust volumes and how to avoid awkward pauses."

The average cost of a wedding band last year decreased by a slim 1%, while 2023 saw a $400 increase from 2022, putting it in line with 2021's band costs. As with most wedding-related expenses, the average cost of a band is higher today than it was in 2019 ($3,700) and in 2018 ($3,900).

A major pro of a wedding band is that you and your guests will get to enjoy live music all night long (and some offer musicians that can play during your ceremony as well). While you may be limited artist-wise, live bands are extremely well versed in different genres. They can create a set of upbeat dance songs and romantic slow songs so that you have the reception of your dreams. Plus, most wedding bands are willing to learn any special requests (like that song you and you S.O. were listening when you had your first kiss). Not only will they provide an unforgettable set, these talented musicians will also help keep the energy of the room up.

## How to Request a Quote From a Wedding DJ and Live Band

As you're researching wedding DJs and bands, one critical query to include on your list of [questions to ask a live band](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-reception-music-questions-to-ask-a-band) or [questions to ask a potential DJ](https://www.theknot.com/content/questions-to-ask-dj) is one about their pricing. Though, the cool thing about browsing The Knot Vendor Marketplace for a [wedding DJ](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/wedding-djs) or [live band](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/live-wedding-bands) is that it makes the process of finding a pro that fits your budget straightforward. You can apply a pricing filter to customize your search (i.e. "Starting Cost: $ – Inexpensive" to "Starting Cost: $$$$ – Luxury") to find results at varied price points. You will also see a "Pricing" section listed on each vendor's page. Scroll down to find details on rates—many have PDFs posted with their packages and pricing parameters.

Typically your wedding music service quote will be based on these variables:

  * Number of hours
  * Number of people (e.g. DJs, MC, musicians)
  * Ceremony music
  * Cocktail hour music
  * Reception music
  * Sound equipment required for the venue spaces and guest count
  * Microphone(s) for the ceremony or speeches
  * Basic lighting equipment
  * Custom lighting options
  * Travel time and meals



As with other wedding pros, there's a range of prices out there, so you can prioritize your budget as you see fit. The thing is, price isn't the only factor to consider when booking a wedding DJ or band. You also want the best fit. Pro tip: To figure out how much to spend on a wedding DJ and live band in your region, use our free [wedding budget tool](https://www.theknot.com/wedding-budget) to estimate expenses.

## Using the Average Cost of a Wedding DJ and Live Band to Decide

The decision of which music maker you select is entirely up to you and your partner. If you're struggling with the [band or DJ for a wedding](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-reception-music-bands-vs-djs), think about the songs you'd like to drop it low to at your reception. If you absolutely need to hear Whitney Houston belt it out at your reception, then maybe a DJ is the way to go. But if you'd rather hear a special guitar solo live, then a wedding band might be your best choice.

"In our experience, you'll get a more diverse music selection with a DJ," says Hastings. "They tend to be more flexible as they aren't working from a set list. They can typically play more songs and more diverse songs in the time frame. Bands tend to be more engaged with the crowd, and while they play fewer songs they are able to really work the crowd and feed off of their energy—and let's be real, who doesn't love live music. You'll have to really know your crowd to make sure they can vibe with the songs you select from the band."

Either way, these wedding pros will ensure that your dance floor is packed all night long and neither will be counted among any [wedding music mistakes](https://www.theknot.com/content/top-9-wedding-music-mistakes).

Of course, you don't _have_ to choose between a DJ or a band. If you want both pros at your celebration and you have the room in your budget, double down. Split the time between a band and a DJ for the ultimate wedding reception entertainment. Or you can hire one vendor for your reception and the other for your after-party. Either way, you'll get all the excitement of live music plus all the variety a DJ offers. How's that for compromise?

Hernandez says: "As technology evolves, hybrid entertainment, such as combining live musicians with DJ services, continues to grow in popularity, allowing couples to curate a dynamic, immersive experience throughout their event.
