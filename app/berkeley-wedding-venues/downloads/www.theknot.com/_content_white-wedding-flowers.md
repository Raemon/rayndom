## White Wedding Bouquets 

Whether you're wearing white wedding attire or mixing it up and donning a color-packed ensemble, an all-white bouquet will complete the look beautifully. White wedding bouquets are a truly classic and timeless option you're sure to look back on in ten years with the same level of fondness you felt on the day you said "I do." 

### 1\. Cascading Bouquet of White Orchids and Eucalyptus

![Cascading Bouquet of White Orchids](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/943554b3-709c-464e-9461-2d91cb478606~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1132.1509)

If you're interested in a bouquet with only one variety of flower, you can never go wrong with a classic choice like all orchids.

Since orchids are such small blooms, bunches of baby's breath add volume to this cascading bouquet. 

### 4\. Cream Dahlia, King Protea and Thistle Bouquet

[Since this Washington, DC, wedding](https://www.theknot.com/real-weddings/white-decor-brought-snowy-winter-charm-to-this-wedding-in-washington-dc-album) was filled with wintry details, it was only natural that the floral designer would add in evergreen sprigs to complete this white wedding bouquet.

_[Liza Kirk Photography](https://www.lizakirk.com),__[Floral Design: Evergreen Flower Co.](https://evergreenflower.co)_

_[Jessica Roberts Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/jessica-roberts-photography-lexington-sc-877486)_

## Top Tips for White Wedding Flowers

When it comes to choosing white wedding flowers, there are a few things to consider to guarantee results you'll love. Here's what we recommend. 

### Focus on Texture

A lack of color doesn't have to mean a lack of visual intrigue. By utilizing different types of [all-white](https://www.theknot.com/content/modern-white-wedding-details) botanicals, you can still have a bouquet that's eye-catching thanks to ample texture. "While this can sometimes be difficult to achieve, making an all-white floral arrangement multi-dimensional is a sure-fire way to avoid falling flat. You can pull this off by weaving in various types of flowers and playing around with different dried grasses or greenery. This creates character and movement, and your arrangement will look like a high-end monotone creation rather than something that's too plain and one-note," says Eddie Zaratsian, owner of [Eddie Zaratsian Lifestyle & Design](https://www.eddiezaratsian.com/).

### Trust Your Floral Designer

Remember that your [floral designer](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/florists) is the expert and they know what varieties will be available on your wedding date in your wedding location. If they suggest swapping lisianthus for peonies because peonies won't be available, defer to their expertise. They'll be able to artfully meld your vision and aesthetic with materials that can be procured for a reasonable price. Michelle Norwood, owner of [Michelle Norwood Events](https://michellenorwood.com/), advises to-be-weds to "choose a florist whose style you like. But don't get caught up on a specific type or color of flowers."
