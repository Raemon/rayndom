If you're just beginning your search for a [bridesmaid dress](https://www.theknot.com/fashion/bridesmaid-dresses), welcome! You might have initial questions about how much you'll have to spend on your wedding party gown—including _what's the average bridesmaid dress cost_?__ We've got answers. The price of wedding party attire typically depends on a few factors, including whether the couple is choosing the dress for you, or if you're given parameters of what your bridesmaid dress should look like (think: color, silhouette, sleeve length). For example, a [bridesmaid dress for a black-tie wedding](https://www.theknot.com/content/black-tie-bridesmaid-dresses) will look different than a casual gown for a backyard gathering—and the cost will reflect that. 

To give you a helping hand, we're sharing new insights around the average cost of bridesmaid dresses, as well as useful shopping tips so you can score a stylish and [trendy bridesmaid dress](https://www.theknot.com/content/new-bridesmaid-dress-trends) that fits within your budget.

## **Average Bridesmaid Dress Cost**

So, _what is the average price of a bridesmaid dress_? Based on [The Knot 2025 Real Weddings Study](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-data-insights/real-weddings-study), which surveyed nearly 17,000 couples who wed in 2024,**** the average bridesmaid dress cost in 2024 was $128 per person, which means it hasn't really changed since 2021.

Still, it's important to keep in mind that what _you_ pay may be something totally different. In reality, how much a bridesmaid dress should cost can vary quite a bit depending on things like the dress designer, the dress style and even your location. 

For example, when you break spending out by region, it's highest in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, where the average cost is closer to $140 per dress. Interestingly, our data shows that age also impacts the average cost for a bridesmaid dress. Guests attending the wedding of a Gen X couple spend the most on a bridesmaid dress, averaging at $146, while the typical bridesmaid dress cost for guests at a Gen Z wedding is only $118 on average; millennials fall in between the two with an average of $131.

## **Bridesmaid Cost Factors to Consider**

Now that we've figured out how much bridesmaid dresses cost, there are also other expenses to consider when creating your overall budget. We break them down below. 

### **Dress Alterations**

Dress alterations can range and add up, depending on the type of changes you make. Some examples include hemming the gown length, tailoring the bust, waist or hips and shortening the straps. As a general rule, the more alterations a dress needs, the higher the overall cost will be. Note: If you're working with a heavily embellished fabric (with sequins, beads, pearls, etc.), alterations could be more expensive, as these fabrics are more difficult to tailor.

### **Completing Your Look**

To complete your bridesmaid dress look, you might want to spruce up your outfit with a few accessories, such as elegant bridesmaid jewelry, dressy[ bridesmaid shoes](https://www.theknot.com/content/the-best-shoes-for-brides-and-bridesmaids) and a stylish clutch. You should also think about your undergarments ahead of time. Do you prefer to wear shapewear with your bridesmaid dress? Or, do you need to buy a special [bra for the wedding](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-dress-bras) (like strapless, backless or adhesives), or seamless [wedding underwear](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-dress-underwear)? Don't forget all the extras you'll need to complete your look for the big day.

### **Hair and Makeup**

While most couples opt for a professional hairstylist and makeup artist, [who pays for the bridesmaids' hair and makeup](https://www.theknot.com/content/who-pays-for-bridesmaid-hair-makeup)? The couple can pay for the entire wedding party (check out the [average cost of wedding hair and makeup](https://www.theknot.com/content/average-cost-wedding-hair-makeup)), or they might choose to only cover a portion of the getting-ready costs. In some cases, the cost of hair and makeup services is the responsibility of each member of the wedding party. Pro tip: If you know [hiring a beauty pro](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/beauty-services) isn't in the cards for you, have an honest conversation with the couple. Another budget-friendly alternative is doing your own hair and makeup for the big day.

## **6 Tips for Finding Bridesmaid Dresses That Fit Your Budget**

Ready to shop for your [bridesmaid dress online](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridesmaid-dresses-online)? Here are some expert tips on how to stay within your budget, whether you want to buy an [affordable bridesmaid dress](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridesmaid-dresses-under-100) or splurge on a lavish gown. 

### **1\. Determine Your Budget**

It's important to be transparent with the couple about your budget needs, so you don't end up in a situation where you have to pay more than you're able to afford. In many cases, even if the bride chooses the attire, [the bridesmaid covers the costs](https://www.theknot.com/content/what-bridesmaids-pay-for) of their entire outfit, including the wedding party dress, shoes and accessories. The bride might give you a specific dress that you'll need to purchase, or they'll provide a price range that they—or the wedding party—have agreed on ahead of time. 

### **2\. Try Before You Buy**

If the bride has elected to have bridesmaids choose their own bridesmaid dress within the paramaters of a certain color scheme or style, you may consider ordering a color swatch from a retailer like [Birdy Grey](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=9ibcrDa*U1o&mid=44848&u1=TK-average-bridesmaid-dress-cost&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.birdygrey.com%2Fcollections%2Fbridesmaid-color-swatches), where you can order up to six free swatches in various colors, prints and fabrics before purchasing a dress. Additionally, many bridesmaid dress retailers—including [Azazie](https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=663686&u=1030781&m=56053&urllink=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Eazazie%2Ecom%2Fall%2Fsample%2Ddresses&afftrack=TK-average-bridesmaid-dress-cost), [Kennedy Blue](https://www.kennedyblue.com/pages/at-home-try-on) and [Revelry](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=51597&awinaffid=565019&campaign=&clickref=TK-average-bridesmaid-dress-cost&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fshoprevelry.com%2Fcollections%2Fhome-try-on&platform=pl)—offer at-home try-on services to help you avoid buying multiple dresses at full price just to see what looks the best. The details of each try-on service vary, but the general idea is that you'll pay a small fee to have a few styles shipped to you. You'll then have a specific amount of time (like a week) with the dresses to choose which style you love the most. 

### **3\. Choose Mismatched Dresses**

If the couple prefers a [mismatched bridesmaid look](https://www.theknot.com/content/mismatched-bridesmaids-dress-tips) with different styles, you'll have a bit more flexibility when it comes to the budget of your wedding party gown. It also means you can express your personal style and taste through the dress you choose. (Just remember to stay within the confines of the bride's preference in terms of color, neckline, length, print and more.)

### **4\. Rent Your Bridesmaid Dress**

Another way to keep bridesmaid dresses prices down is to rent one! Not to mention, renting is more sustainable and surprisingly easy to navigate. Some [bridesmaid dress rental](https://www.theknot.com/content/best-clothing-rental-sites-for-every-wedding-event) services to consider include [Nuuly](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=9ibcrDa*U1o&mid=44644&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nuuly.com%2Frent&u1=TK-average-bridesmaid-dress-cost) (use the code "THEKNOT20" to save 20% off your first order) and [Rent the Runway](https://www.pjatr.com/t/8-12557-88550-223734?sid=TK-average-bridesmaid-dress-cost&website=177979&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.renttherunway.com%2F). How much are bridesmaid dresses that are rented? Check out the details of each subscription service on the brand websites to learn more!

### **5\. Shop Secondhand Dresses**

You could also shop secondhand if you don't want to spend too much for a bridesmaid dress. Search brand names and styles on [Poshmark](https://poshmark.com/), [thredUP](https://www.thredup.com/), [eBay](https://www.ebay.com/b/Bridesmaid-Dresses/175633/bn_223032) and more to find a [used bridesmaid dress](https://www.theknot.com/content/places-to-sell-bridesmaid-dresses) that's still in excellent condition. Tip: Make sure to look at the dress that you're purchasing up close so you can analyze potential wear and tear. Also, secondhand dresses might already be tailored to someone else's measurements, so additional alterations might be required when purchasing a used gown.

### 6\. Shop Seasonal Sales

Depending on the date of the wedding, you may be able to snag your dress at a discount as a lot of bridesmaid dress brands do big holiday sales. Check out [Black Friday and Cyber Monday wedding deals](https://www.theknot.com/content/brides-guide-black-friday-sales) or [wedding discounts](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-discounts) during President's Day or Memorial Day weekend to find the perfect bridesmaid dress that won't break the bank.
