This review is based on Jenny’s company Blushed beauty bridal not her personal work though all communication was done with Jenny. I booked with Blushed beauty about one year before...

my wedding, I was never sent a questionnaire to match me with the best stylist for my skin type etc. When I went to schedule my trial I requested her stylist Ava as I really loved her work and she did multiple styles that were similar to what I was wanting for my big day. Jenny got back to me and let me know that unfortunately Ava was moving out of state and wouldn’t be available on my wedding day due to that. I didn’t think anything of it until I continued seeing Ava posting on her instagram still working in the Bay Area and for Blushed beauty as late as the week of my wedding. I’m not sure why I was lied to about that. I ended up doing my makeup trial and though the stylist I was assigned was very sweet and talented I feel like she wasn’t the best match for what I was wanting. I was nervous leading up to my wedding day because I wasn’t sure I would be happy with my makeup day of. I ended up getting a completely different makeup artist day of because unfortunately the one assigned was in the hospital so a replacement was sent. The replacement MUA was also very nice and talented but I still feel like I did not get the look I had envisioned for my wedding.

I really hesitated to write a review but I want other brides to be aware of Jenny's business practices and unreliability. I booked Jenny over a year out from my wedding. She reache...

d out via email about 7 months prior to my wedding and let me know that her cousin had gotten engaged and had booked the same wedding date as me at a location a few hours from my venue and she would not longer be able to do my makeup. She told me that she has never had to cancel on anyone before. I completely understand things come up and that her cousin takes priority. However, I don't agree with lying to your customer and I was lied to. She offered for one of her assistants to do my makeup for a $40 discount. Personally, I don't feel that her assistants are up to her caliber of work. I found that to be a bit insulting as it was now a scramble for me to find a new artist as all the good ones book up a ways in advance. On the day of my wedding, Jenny posted on her instagram that she was at a prestigious Napa venue, not in Monterey at her cousins wedding. My guess is that Jenny got either a larger party booking (I was only booked for 3 people) or, she wanted to work at the more prestigious venue. That being said, I don't think a business owner should lie to their customers. My wedding has now passed but after talking to a few people about my experience, I found out that Jenny had also cancelled on one of my friends on another occasion. If this has now happened to 2 people, I can only imagine who else she has cancelled on. Brides have enough stress when it comes to wedding planning, so unless you have a large party or are getting married at a really nice venue, I would advise against booking her and look for someone more reliable.

Jenny was fantastic and helped me feel beautiful on my wedding day. I rarely wear make up and I was so concerned about having too much on and not looking like myself on my wedding ...

day. Jenny understood my concerns and made me look so natural and beautiful! I cannot thank her enough.

each bridesmaid as she moves through her process. She communicates clearly, has smooth intuitive business systems, and helps you prepare for the big day with skin care tips, etc. She did a great job educating about unexpected ramifications, such as helping me realize I did not want “full coverage” due to the ramification of causing creases. The preview was instrumental, and she took thorough notes to make sure that my feedback was implemented on the wedding day. She also worked seamlessly with the hairstylist to make the whole process completely hassle-free. My bridesmaids and I both absolutely loved the experience of working with Jenny and her teammate Sarah!

Looking for a make up artist for your wedding or other special occasion? RUN, do not walk, to Jenny Lucia. We are two brides-- an interracial couple at that. We wanted to find some...

one who celebrated our love, and could also do great work on both white and black skin. Enter Jenny Lucia. We didn't do a trial and decided to just wing it. Jenny and her team arrived on time and immediately got to work. I am FAR from a woman who does their makeup on a regular basis; typically, mascara is for special occasions. I told Jenny I wanted to look "medium glam" and "romantic." These words don't seem to give a lot of direction, but Jenny NAILED it. I have never felt more beautiful in my life. My wife's make up looked like it was off a magazine cover. Her team also did impeccable work; each one of our bridesmaids/family members came off the chair with a huge smile on their face. I truly cannot recommend Jenny enough -- she is the perfect combination of insanely talented, professional, and fun to be around. Thank you Jenny-- you exceeded my wildest wedding makeup dreams!

I would really caution any bride about booking with Jenny as her business communication style is hugely disappointing. I contacted her several weeks prior to my engagement photo se...

ssion to book her makeup services for my engagement photos. We emailed back and forth and we agreed on a location and on a time for her to do my makeup. We settled on a time that worked around some of her other bookings. When I emailed and agreed to the time that she suggested and worked for her, I received no follow up confirmation or any information about sending a deposit. I thought that if she needed a deposit she would have told me, nevertheless I believed she had booked me after we settled on a date and time. About 10 days later and two weeks prior to the date, I sent an email to verify and receive confirmation of my booking and to ask if I needed to send a deposit. No response. Five days later and less than a week prior to my appointment, I sent another follow up email. No response. Three days before my engagement session I finally had to DM her on Instagram to get a response where she claims to have not seen my emails (I sent her screenshots with time stamps) despite her previously having been communicative with me via email, and that if she didn't receive a deposit and didn't send me a confirmation then I wasn't booked. I asked her how this happened because I felt I had done everything on my end to make a successful booking with her and she said that she just gets a lot of messages and can't get back to everyone, justifying her ghosting on her prospective clients. I was then left with no time to book another MUA with so little time prior to my engagement photos. I would rather she have told me from the start that she couldn't accommodate me and been up front and honest so that I could have looked elsewhere. I would have understood. It seems like she spends more time posting on Instagram than checking her business emails. Bottom line: If you want someone who justifies ghosting prospective clients and is totally fine with leaving prospective clients hanging then proceed with caution. I truly hope that she changes her business practices because I can't imagine if she had done this just prior to someone's wedding.

tylist. The trial run was beyond perfect I couldn't wait for the wedding day. She did the makeup for me and six bridesmaids. Everyone loved their makeup and she was able to accommodate different skin types. My makeup was beyond perfect, and I couldn't have asked for a better makeup artist for my day.

Jenny is hands down the BEST makeup artist to have do your makeup!! Once I found her on IG, she was quick to respond and was able to do my makeup trial in the time frame I wanted. ...

We did the makeup trial a few months before my wedding, she took what inspo pictures I wanted and asked questions throughout the whole trial. Jenny listened to anything specific I wanted and even tried different looks making me fall in love with each new thing she did! Even during the complications of me changing my venue (6 times) during this pandemic she was still so sweet and understanding, willing to go anywhere we planned. On the wedding day she was so sweet and friendly, kept me from being overly nervous. The wedding day makeup was beautiful and stayed put throughout the whole day, by the time I got to our after party at the hotel I still looked dewy and beautiful I ended up keeping the makeup on. (Second picture shown) If you are looking for a great makeup artist I highly recommend Jenny!!!
