rvice Full Review: I don't even know where to begin - having our wedding ceremony and reception at Angelicas was the perfect experience. I wanted to get married locally but to get a destination wedding experience where someone works with you to do all of the setup and manage all details in one place. The alternative felt a little overwhelming to me. Angelicas did nearly everything and executed our wedding and brunch reception flawlessly. Wedding Planning: I worked with Crystal and she planned everything with me: guest seating, extra tables for gift bags, music, walk out order for ceremony, timelines, food options, forals, etc. The only items I vendored outside of Angelicas were the cake, the photographer, the officiant, hair & makeup/clothes, and some personal decor items (like pictures or custom seating cards). Everything else Anglicas did in-house, and it was perfect. Throughout the planning process, Crystal and I worked together via a series of phone meetings and email—easy, convenient, and clear communication. I shared pinterest boards, and she provided pictures for reference for the florals and decor, pricing plans, and even worked with me to stay within my budget. She was also incredibly kind and gentle, which gave off a calming vibe (both while planning and at the wedding). Decor: I'm going to attach pictures that will speak for themselves, but the decor was lovely. My wedding was for around 30 people in a courtyard and it felt very spacious. We had a long table for dining, a ceremony area, cake table, book signing table, table for gift bags. I wasn't sure how it'd all fit, but it did and it felt very spacious. Certain areas were changed out (the ceremony area became a buffet table area), but the guests and my husband and I were all shocked at how we didn't even notice this happening. Flawless setup, flawless execution, calming atmosphere. Food & Drink: The food and drinks were wonderful. I really wanted a wedding brunch and Angelicas was the perfect place to do that. Before the ceremony, guests were able to get mimosas and bloody marys to enjoy while waiting, while we did pictures they had a charcuterie board with more drinks, and then we all enjoyed the most delicious brunch together. As the bride and groom, we were served without having to get up - which was a detail I didn't even think of but was very appreciated. And everyone commented after about how we wouldn't even notice and our drinks were refilled. The staff was incredible - polite, kind, and shockingly quiet (in a good way). Music: I decided to go for a less expensive option with music and have music play from spotify. Crystal made all of the right music play at the right time. It sounded lovely, was audible in the wedding space, and was a great experience as an affordable option. Florals: Angelicas does the florals themselves: bouquets, corsages, wedding arch, table flowers - and they were absolutely lovely. I shared what I wanted off of pinterest and it was perfect.

ut out to Crystal, the event coordinator. From the very beginning, she’s been a joy to work with and provided great suggestions on various aspects of the wedding. She is very organized and responsive to all our questions and made planning such a breeze. She executed our day of plans to a tee. Not to mention she had a very calming presence. We were both really nervous before the ceremony and knowing we are in extremely good hands with Crystal put us at much ease. The entire staff was friendly and efficient. We highly recommend Angelicas!

ery, flowers and a water fountain. I sent Crystal, the event coordinator, my inspiration pics and she made it happen! She was very responsive to my emails. We met with her on a couple of occasions to talk about the specifics. She set up everything for the ceremony and reception. If you haven’t eaten at Angelica’s I suggest going there to try. Our guests loved the food! We also had a fun mimosa bar. Angelica, the owner, not only cooks but she also does flower arrangements. This was one of the things I really wanted to go all out on. She special ordered certain flowers, built a backdrop, made all of the centerpieces and the bouquet. Absolutely stunning!! The day of the staff was so helpful, professional and friendly. We provided our cake, dj and photog other than that Angelica’s took care of everything. We will be forever grateful for what they created for us!
