Trivia’s team was warm, attentive, and organized, making the planning process feel stress-free. On the day of our wedding, everything looked beautiful, and the floral arrangements were exactly what I envisioned. We did have a small hiccup with our entry song not playing correctly with the DJ. It was a moment that could have been stressful, but Trivia and her team immediately stepped in, communicating calmly with the DJ and working together to troubleshoot the issue on the spot. Because of their quick thinking and commitment to ensuring our day went perfectly, my song was able to play, and we made our entrance just as I had dreamed. We genuinely felt cared for by Trivia and her team, and it was clear they wanted our day to feel seamless and special, no matter what challenges came up. If you’re looking for a team that not only brings your wedding vision to life but is also prepared to handle the unexpected with grace and solutions, we highly recommend working with Trivia. Thank you for making our day beautiful and stress-free!

r finding out the company went out of business 😭), we were honestly discouraged. Then we found Trivia and her team at Venue To Go, and they were a breath of fresh air. Trivia picked up the pieces where we left off and made planning feel enjoyable again. She was so informative and patient, helping us select all of our vendors and even assisting with my makeup look (by the way, Trivia has incredible style so I trusted her on this, lol!). When the wedding day came, everything was perfect. If there were any hiccups, we wouldn’t have even known! Well, there was one hiccup— I almost tripped over my dress as I was walking down the aisle, but Trivia immediately stepped in to fluff my train and adjust it on the spot, helping me avoid a fall and letting me walk with confidence. On top of planning, Trivia and her team designed and created our florals, including a stunning floral arch installation and pops of color with bud vases that elevated the entire space. I’m not sure how she does it, but wow. This girl is truly a jack of all trades and made our wedding day feel effortless, beautiful, and stress-free. We are so grateful to Trivia and Venue To Go for making our wedding dreams come true! — Sarah & Kabir

ya) booked Venue To Go for full-service planning, I felt an immediate sense of calm knowing I had a team who genuinely cared about bringing our vision to life. Trivia’s attention to detail is unmatched — from helping us find the perfect vendors, to guiding us through selecting our food menu, to making sure the flow of the day reflected who we are as a couple. We didn’t just feel like clients; Trivia truly is the “borrowed best friend” every couple dreams of having during planning. Her support, warmth, and professionalism made the process feel effortless, and Jamal and I were able to actually enjoy our engagement instead of stressing about the endless details that go into planning a wedding. On the wedding day, everything came together beautifully. The Venue To Go team managed the timeline seamlessly, handled every vendor coordination with care, and made sure we could be fully present to soak in every moment with our loved ones. Trivia, thank you for treating our wedding as if it was your own and for helping us create a day that we will cherish forever. Jamal and I are so appreciative of you and your team! If you are considering Venue To Go for your wedding, book them. It will be the best decision you make during your planning journey.

Not only that but they were so willing to just get everything done even though we had very little prep time and a tall order for decor set up. They kept us hydrated and positive, set up all our dessert table and centerpiece decorations, asked clarifying questions with respect (we had a big crazy Jewish wedding with lots of moving parts) and they were just a joy to be around. They added in charger rental and offered helpful advice for floral seasons, and we are so so so so so so happy we went with them. 10/10 would recommend!

We can’t imagine what our wedding day would have been like without Trivia and her assistants’ help. Our first meeting with her was so helpful, reassuring and validating. She helped...

point out some of the things we really needed to focus on and start thinking about more concretely. She asked us all the questions that helped us fine tune our needs and vision, so that we could really focus on what was important for us to materialize our perfect day. Once we got to 30 days out from the wedding date, Trivia started contacting our vendors and making sure everyone was on the same page. She was great at making sure she had all the info she needed, and was so amazing with her communication. She’s sort of like a brilliant “wedding conductor” if you will. She’s unbelievably resourceful, and we really liked her calm and composed demeanor throughout the experience. All the way up to the day of the wedding, Trivia was great at documenting and sharing the logistical milestones and made sure no detail was missed. She made herself available for our wedding rehearsal the day before the wedding. This was incredibly helpful because she made sure the entire wedding party was aware of their role and placement for the whole ceremony. She had us run through the whole procession several times, to make sure everything would go smoothly on the day of - which it absolutely did. We’re still in absolute awe of the work Trivia and her team did on our actual wedding day. They went way above and beyond what we’d originally agreed on. They helped us with more details than we could have imagined: coordinating every item on the timeline and helping us stay on track from the moment the vendors started arriving, to the moment the guests started arriving, running around the whole venue all day making sure everything was on track. Trivia and her team also set up all the centerpieces, checked in with all the vendors (band, stage, Caterers, photobooth, bar, rentals, venue, MC, photographer etc), and at the end of the event, they helped bring in so many of the cocktail tables, cleaned up things that were left out etc. everything felt seamless and stress-free from our perspective as the bride and groom. Our wedding was initially pretty complicated logistically because as the bride and groom we also performed on stage with our bands, but Trivia really made sure that everything went without a hitch! She even made sure there was still time to cut the cake and do our first dance, which we really thought we wouldn’t have time to do since there was so much happening on and off stage. Her team even made sure to pack us up extra food for us, knowing we probably wouldn’t eat much during the day. The cherry on top was a lovely surprise center piece that Trivia made for our Sweethearts’ table. It was gorgeous and even had our wedding colors. That was so thoughtful and kind of her, and is such a testament to how much she truly cares about every detail, and how important it is for her to see her couples happy. Trivia is an absolute gem and anyone would be so lucky to have her and her team by their side on their special day. Trivia is such a wonderful human and professional. She will make sure your perfect day is truly the best day of your life, which it was exactly that for us! We’re so thankful and blessed Trivia and her team were a part of our wedding magic!, and we would recommend them to anyone in a heartbeat!
