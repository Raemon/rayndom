When I’m not at Los Serranos, I enjoy family trips to the Disneyland Parks. My favorite month is October, and I love decorating my house with a mix of Fall and Halloween décor. Lastly, when I have the time, I enjoy curling up on the couch with a good true crime novel.

50 out of 10. Los Serranos gives you an unbelievable amount of bang for your buck. We held our wedding reception at LS yesterday (June 2025). Short and to the point, these were my ...

favorite things about the venue: 1) Gorgeous and classy venue. Beautiful decor inside the dining hall and a clean, festive outdoor patio. 2) The food was delicious and the service from the kitchen/serving staff was on point and friendly. 3) Very competitive price point compared to other local venues. 4) Most importantly, Michele and Marlisha were an absolute BREEZE to work with. Communications were quick, accurate, professional, calm, and always friendly. We felt prioritized and cared for. 5) Gina the partner decorator was incredible as well, she got us exactly the aesthetic we were looking for at a competitive price point. Highly recommend.

more. Michele is amazing and was so helpful to us throughout our planning process and on the day-of. The pricing was also reasonable especially considering how much was included. The food and drinks were fantastic as well and our guests said everything was perfect! Getting to go out onto the golf course to take bride and groom photos after the ceremony was another fantastic bonus and my husband and I were able to get some stunning photos. This venue also has both a bride and a groom suite which we were so glad to have for getting ready with our wedding parties. I would highly, highly recommend Los Serranos to anyone looking for a wedding venue in Southern California!

lle Poladian was by far the best wedding coordinator I could’ve ever asked her if she was so quick on the response time Michelle Poladian made me and my now husband feel like family she was very attentive to my needs as a bride. Michelle Poladian definitely made the whole process smooth and perfect. Will be recommending Michelle Poladian as a coordinator for anybody and everybody who asks about the Serranos golf course for events. Throughout the whole stressful process of planning a wedding Michelle made the coordinating part at the venue less stressful. I couldn’t have asked for a better wedding coordinator than Michelle herself. I enjoyed every minute of every day that I got to spend with her she made the whole planning process unforgettable!! Love love loved her so much!

way to provide things that they normally did not carry. You could not find anyone better. We loved the room, the glass windows gives such a open feeling. We opt to spend alittle for the lighted drapes that just gave the room a more elegant feeling. The food was awesome, had rave reviews from our guest on the whole event. We had the flowers done by Gina , who works with the country club on decorating. She does great work! Have her do the drape for the cake back drop. It is beautiful. She is VERY reasonable on her cost.
