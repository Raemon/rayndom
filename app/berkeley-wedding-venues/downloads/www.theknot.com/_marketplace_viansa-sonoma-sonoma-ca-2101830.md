Jamaal was a fabulous and knowledgeable server. Viansa was my first stop in CA wine country and I’m so glad because it set my bar high! Incredible views and delicious wines. Purchased a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc to take home. Hope I am able to ...

make it back out to Sonoma soon and come again.

Beautiful winery and vineyard with an amazing view. We had a lovely tasting with Adrian on the back porch that was both fun and informative. They have a large assortment of wines which makes it easy to fine one to please both white and red love...

rs. Although we didn’t have a chance to try all their meats and cheeses they had an impressive assortment.

We absolutely loved our afternoon tasting at Viansa. Our host, Adrian, was exceptionally knowledgeable about the wines we tasted along with the terroir that produced each varietal. We loved the rose, the Sangiovese and the Nero D'Avola which is...

certainly a rare treat to experience at a Sonoma / Napa winery. Each wine tasted very individual and this is NOT your standard Napa jammy cab shop! We never felt rushed or under pressure to buy wine, although we did happily leave with three bottles to enjoy at home! Can't recommend this place, or Adrian, highly enough for a wonderful afternoon of wine tasting with spectacular views and wines to match! Pictures of the stunning property and also my parents excited about the prospect of more wine tasting at home :)

Had the best late afternoon lunch and wine tasting experience at Viansa Winery. Cole was a gracious host, very knowledgeable about the wine and nailed our differences in taste, customizing our tastings with perfection. The food was delicious to...

o! We shared the charcuterie board for 2 and an Italian sandwich on a fresh, soft ciabotta roll. The property and views were picturesque. And the music selection completed the ambiance with a relaxing and easy vibe. We could have spent all day there! We took home prosecco and their signature white. I even bought a cute hat and sweater at their boutique marketplace on site. Loved every minute and worth every penny.

We got a reservation at this winery through a family member. For our honeymoon we couldn't have asked for a better experience! Austin our host was our warm and friendly server who made the experience an 11/10. He appealed to us on a personal le...

vel as well as giving us a awesome experience for the tour of the wines for us to experience. My wife's favourite was the light prosecco at the start of the tour due to her affinity towards sparkling wine. Whereas mine was all the wines they gave us on the tour but if I had to pick one that rose ever so slightly above the rest, the Quattro Super Tuscan was excellent. I'm not a wine connoisseur by any stretch of the imagination but it was absolutely stellar. The cheese charcuterie board as well as the other food they served us was amazing. We ordered the ham and Brie cheese sandwich and also the Italian sandwich and the food was great. Excellent, service, excellent wine and food all across the board.
