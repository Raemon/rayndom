Went to my friend's wedding at the Holly Farm in Carmel in July and I couldn't believe the band! I didn't expect to see that level of entertainment at a wedding. They were playing ...

as we came in, just loud enough, and people gradually headed to the dance floor. It ended up being a great night, progressively getting more intense until the band finished. By the finale there was fun audience participation was happening and everyone was having a great time. I'd book them for my wedding if I wasn't already married!

es a great job interacting with the audience and keeping everyone engaged (from youngsters to the grandparents!). At each of the parties, Notorious has done a fantastic job keeping the dance floor filled the entire time. For me, this is an extremely important part of any good celebration. They clearly cater to the venue and individualize songs to match the occasion.

Notorious is synonymous with professionalism, perfection, and PARTY! My husband and I hired this top-knotch band last summer for our wedding and from the initial contact with the a...

gency to the last song of the night, we were so impressed. They honored our song requests, got everyone up and moving and loving every minute of it, and played to the diversity of our guests. The cadence of the song choices showed collaborative musicians who know how to please a crowd; there was an ebb and flow that moved the night along- slow songs for our more mature guests, classic rock n roll, sing-a-longs that had people reminiscing about the best days of our lives, and songs that appealed to the young and “young at heart.” The emcee and drummer, Tim, was energetic and kept the night en pointe. My husband and I will always be grateful to Notorious for giving us one of the best nights of our lives and and something we’ll always agree on- Notorious ROCKS!

There was something for everyone, and it seemed like everyone made an appearance on the dance floor at some point during the evening. There were people dancing throughout the whole night. The band was prompt and professional, plus they were a pleasure to work with, and our planner agreed. If you want a great looking and sounding band for your wedding look no further.

and flawlessly (and an acoustic version at that!) and were an absolute dream to work with. One of my favorite memories from our wedding was getting on stage with my husband and the band to dance and belt out Toto's 'Africa' and have all of our guests singing it at the top of their lungs. We would 100% and with full confidence recommend Notorious to any couple for their wedding day. Thank you for making ours so memorable!

Notorious TOTALLY rocks!! The band brought down the house at our wedding this past Labor Day and had our guests dancing from the moment they took the stage! I have to say too - w...

e saw about 7 bands before we chose Notorious - and they were totally the right choice for us! What was most impressive was that they seemed to be able to read our guests, and respond to the types of songs that kept them really energized. A month later, I keep hearing from people how amazing the band was, and how they couldn't believe how fast the dancing flew by. No one wanted to stop! They also were willing to learn new songs for us (including our first dance) and were generally just a pleasure to work with. We also hired Eli to play guitar during our ceremony and cocktail hour - and he was also amazing. Other than picking the processional and recessional songs, we asked him just to make sure our guests had fun - and his song choices were perfect for the feel we wanted! One other thing that I wanted to also acknowledge was how responsive and easy the band was to work with! Even in the last few weeks, they made it so easy to coordinate, and the management company was super responsive to any questions I had.

whole night. Our wedding was during a massive heat wave and we thought no one would want to dance - but the music was just too good!! The playlist is a mix of 80's, 90's and contemporary... all with a focus on songs good for dancing. They also performed our first dance song (Can't Help Falling in Love) by request and did a great job with it.

There are two ratings as part of this, first is for the band, second is for the talent management company that arranged everything. And yes, they both get the outstanding and extr...

aordinary rating. First Notorious: Our wedding guests are still raving about how amazing this group was, throughout the night and even now talking to guests I get "best band ever", constantly. And while I'll take the credit for picking them it was their energy, skill, and ability to even get those self-proclaimed "non-dancers" on the dance floor that earned them the title around my nearest and dearest. They accommodated all our song requests and kept the energy going straight through the end of the night. I'm not doing them proper justice, we are obsessed with them, and we will continue to go to their shows and dance the night away to the music. Also, I would highly, highly, recommend Eli for your ceremony music. He made everything I wanted work for the recessional and even made new compositions to accommodate some of our music choices that didn’t easily translate into a recognizable acoustic version. Second JSP: So having never planned a wedding before I obviously missed some things; like the stage size, the venue requiring a generator, etc. Sarah at JSP was incredibly patient and made everything work. She coordinated everyone, was proactive with communication and generally made my life a lot easier through the entire planning process. On top of Sarah’s support during the planning process the technicians working the actual event were timely and accommodating. Each delivery arrived exactly on time and worked efficiently to get everything set up. Working with the venue owner to accommodate his requests and went above and beyond to make sure not only I was comfortable but that they were working around and with every other vendor. I didn’t have to do anything other than enjoy the show. They never once needed anything from me and if there was anything challenging that might have happened I had no idea. Exactly how we wanted our wedding day.

king with them - they were so easy to talk with and help plan a super fun reception. They worked with all of our crazy requests and even learned our first dance song for us and were amazing! Their energy was incredible and they really brought everyone to the dance floor - old and young. In fact, we ran out of space on the dance floor because everyone wanted to join the fun. We also worked with Eli to play the guitar for our ceremony and he was amazing. He was willing to work with my friend who is a singer and even had a practice with her ahead of the ceremony. It made for a very special ceremony. I've already recommended Notorious to other friends who had them at their wedding too and had the same experience as we did. I cannot recommend them enough! We will always remember Notorious and how they made our wedding reception! Thank you Notorious!!!

they took the stage, to the last song, they had everyone at my wedding on the dance floor, singing and rocking out to the music. It was fantastic! It was the consensus amongst our guests that they were the best band from any event they had attended. Before my wedding, I corresponded with Sarah, from their management team, to hammer out all the details and she was an absolute pleasure to work with. She worked with me to understand what type of music we liked and if there were any special request songs we wanted so that the band could tailor their sets to our tastes. She even arranged to get us a sample from the band of our first dance song so that my husband and I could practice. I would highly recommend hiring Notorious for any wedding or social event. They are professional and high energy and they made my wedding an experience I will never forget. I wouldn't hesitate to hire them again!

Notorious played our wedding and were absolutely fantastic. They have a dressed up look that fit in well with our black tie event. Their wide-ranging song list is packed with cro...

wd pleasers for both our parents as well as our younger cousins. They have both a male and female vocalist so they can cover pretty much any song well. They read the crowd perfectly and transitioned to more recent songs when our guests from our parents' generation started thinning out of the dance floor. Even so, they kept the dance floor packed and energized all the way until the last song at 11:30pm. In addition to being a wonderful band, they were quite flexible and easy to work with. They were willing to do a recording of the 1st dance song in advance so that we were able to practice with their rendition. They also learned two songs that were special to us but not on their playlist. Nearly every guest came to us later and told us how much they enjoyed the band. We have a few musically inclined guests, including one jazz pianist as well as a drummer in a local rock band, and they all mentioned how impressed they were with the musical skill of the band, and that they were "tight". Before picking Notorious, we watched all of the local wedding bands play at nearby venues, and we picked Notorious because of their music, their energy, and their ability to keep the dance floor moving. They delivered. In summary, Notorious is the best in the area and at the top of their game. They are easy to work with and massively exceeded all of our expectations. Book them early - they are in high demand.

They played lots of 80's per my request but mixed it up with other fun stuff and payed perfect attention to my dislikes too!;I'm sure they are hard to book so don't hesitate if you have the opportunity. They are worth every penny and your guests will think so too. You may think that your 'older' guests may dislike their style but this was not the case. They can be a little wild but will play CD's during breaks for the older folks too!
