Thanks to recommendations from couples on The Knot

Instant Pretty Lashes—Luxury Mobile Salon is a wedding hair and makeup company based in Livermore, CA. The business was founded in June 2014 by freelance artist and Bay Area native Christina Mendez. She provides exclusive services, including makeup application and eyelash extensions, in the privacy of her valued clients' homes. Christina soon realized that a gap in the beauty industry had fallen between the stylist, the client, and traditional salons. She wanted to bridge this gap and continue to provide exceptional service without losing respect for what clients seek in a traditional salon: relaxation, quality, and availability. In 2016, Christina turned a dream into a reality. She collaborated with Mercedes Benz to create a mobile salon specially designed and custom-built, allowing her to bring the traditional salon to the clients's doors.

Absolutely Amazing Experience with Instant Pretty Lashes! I had my wedding in September, and Christina from Instant Pretty Lashes was truly incredible! She did hair and makeup for ...

my entire group — my bridal party of 5, 7 daughters, my mom, and me — and managed everything with professionalism, warmth, and so much fun energy. Christina arrived early, kept us perfectly on schedule, and even provided music to make the morning feel relaxed and enjoyable. She went above and beyond when a few of the girls decided last-minute that they wanted makeup done, fitting them in without missing a beat. Every look was absolutely beautiful — the hair and makeup lasted all day and night, and everything looked stunning in our photos. Christina’s talent, organization, and friendly personality made the whole experience stress-free and fun. I can’t recommend Instant Pretty Lashes enough for anyone looking for flawless hair and makeup and an amazing team to share your wedding glam session with!

credible. She took the time to really listen to my vision and made sure to incorporate all of my preferences, while also offering expert advice to help me look my best. On the day of the wedding, Christina was punctual, professional, and incredibly calming (which was so appreciated in the midst of all the pre-wedding excitement!). My hair and makeup turned out even more beautiful than I could have imagined — I felt like the best version of myself, but with that extra bridal glow! Not only did I love the way everything looked, but it also lasted throughout the entire day and night. From the ceremony to the reception, I never had to worry about touch-ups — everything stayed flawless from start to finish. Plus, the whole team was so friendly and made the entire experience fun and relaxing. I’m so grateful for Christina for making me feel so stunning on my wedding day. If you're looking for a talented, reliable, and truly wonderful hair and makeup artist, I highly recommend them — you won’t regret it!

reakfast consisting of mini bagels and bottle of champagne for the morning of (it was a lovely touch). They were extremely efficient even with such a large bridal party of 10 of us total (7 bridesmaids, bride, and 2 moms) that had to be ready by 2pm. They truly made their magic work. I love that the makeup Christina does is very natural and not over the top. For my mother in law who had never had makeup done before and never wears makeup, she was extremely nervous. However, after Christina was finished, she couldn't stop looking at herself in the mirror! She made my mother in law feel beautiful and still look super natural. As for hair, Erin was equally as incredible. As the bride, I hadn't nailed down my hairstyle decision until the day of. As there wasn't much time before we had to leave, and I was the last to get my hair done, I was really nervous that there wasn't going to be enough time for my hair to be done on time. Erin made it happen and I was in love with the way she was able to incorporate both my mother's wedding hair piece and baby's breath. Definitely got me emotional seeing the final product! This team is so down to earth and easy to get along with, I would highly recommend them for any bride to be!

Christina and her team are amazing. I had a not-great experience with a makeup trial from a different artist. Christina listened to all of my concerns (creasing and makeup settling...

into my fine lines). She paid extra attention to these areas at our makeup trial and I felt really comfortable with who I hired. Wedding day was EVEN BETTER than our trial. Christina and Erin took their time and were so patient on my hair and makeup. Christina gave me the BEST lymphatic facial massage. I swear I still think about it weeks later. She had my skin glowing! Wedding day morning and I still had no idea what to do with my hair. Erin and I threw around options and I’m so happy with what we decided. My hair and makeup were the perfect glam. There was also some family drama happening in the suite. Christina quickly calmed the vibes in the room (while doing my makeup) and I don’t know what I would have done without her in that moment!

d she and her amazing team far exceeded our expectations. I gave her a tall order with me, five bridesmaids, 3 moms, a tight timeline, disgustingly early start time, and an overnight stay and she ensured everything was perfect. Erin, Nicole, and Christina were kind, professional, and took all the diverse ideas, visions, and individual concerns of the girls and made them feel heard and BEAUTIFUL while ensuring their comfort and confidence. My hair and makeup stayed ALL DAY for the wedding and even after a night full of dancing and all day picture taking my makeup looked fresh and my hair in place despite climbing in the redwoods. From the moment I met with Christina, to my HMU trial, and finally to my wedding day Christina and her Instant Pretty Lashes team was helpful and with me every step of the way eliminating any concerns and nerves I may have had leading up to that day. I am honored to of had the team that Christina put together for us on my wedding day. I will ALWAYS recommend Instant Pretty Lashes and will definitely be using Christina in the future for my beauty and makeup needs 🤍

Christina made me feel comfortable and even allowed to me to step aside and do my lip liner (I am very particular about this) to ensure that I was happy with the result. She followed up with me leading up to the event to make sure she had all the colors I wanted to complete my look and went above and beyond. Morgan did my bridesmaids and they were all super happy with their results. The makeup lasted through the entire night. Both women were professional, punctual, and fun to chat with.

No one else is doing this and it was so convenient! She came up to my hotel room and did the eyelashes in her cute and comfortable van because the lighting in there was amazing! She is so wonderful to talk with and I believe I made a new friend during all our sessions. She has good energy, is professional, and responded to my many many many questions and concerns during the entire year before my wedding. On the big day, I fought back the tears after I saw myself in the mirror. My now husband said he's never seen me so beautiful! I've never seen my mother or my sister look so beautiful and confident. Truly she made sure everyone in my party was taken care of and looked absolutely gorgeous! I would give her 100 stars if I could! I am so glad I decided to go with the Instant Pretty Lashes beauty team!

at I scheduled 3 makeup trials with 3 different companies. The first 2 trials were huge let downs. Thank God for Christina who listened to exactly what I was requesting. She chose the perfect combination of shadow, cheek and lip colors to complement my skin and the overall look I was going for. My Hair was done by Erin, who also did an amazing job of giving me the waves I had requested. My hair and makeup needed ZERO touch up - ZERO from the time they left my house until the evening had ended. In addition to myself, 8 of my girlfriends also had both their hair and makeup done by Instant Pretty Lashes. They all looked absolutely stunning. I can honestly say that there wasn't a single complaint from anyone, only rave reviews and comments about hiring the team next time there was a reason to. Not only was Christina professional and organized, but she is also a genuinely kind person who all of us enjoyed spending time with. Here amazing Mercedes mobile solon is just the icing on the cake. I have a small home, so having the mobile salon allowed plenty of space for all of my friends and I to relax in my house while girls took turns being pampered in the salon. I would 100% use Instant Pretty Lashes again! I honestly couldn't have been happier with how my makeup and hair looked on the one day that it really mattered. Thank you, Instant Pretty Lashes!!!

out beautifully on everyone! They were also very experienced with mature hair and skin, as my mother-in-law and grandma looked fabulous. As for myself, I was so happy with the final result- I looked exactly how I wanted to look on my wedding day: classy and super glamorous!!

Christina and her team where more than great, they were PHENOMINAL! If I could give her more than 5 stars I would! Christina’s team did my hair/makeup for my wedding and it by far ...

exceeded my expectations. Christina was flexible and communicative throughout the entire process - beginning to end, not leaving one detail unturned. During my trial, she was very attentive and patient when I showed her ideas and was extremely supportive when we talked through different looks and ideas that I had. She NAILED the perfect wedding look for me! She listened to exactly what I wanted and made me look stunning on my wedding day, I felt like a queen. She is also amazing with brow lamination; my brows had never looked fuller and more FAB. I would seriously consider getting your brows laminated the week before your wedding! Christina is extremely professional, easy going and made me feel so comfortable. She also has the best energy and plays the best music! My makeup stayed on all night - even in the June heat. It looked perfect all the way through even after hours of dancing! My hair never went flat and had volume throughout the entire wedding start to finish – Hollywood waves intact! If you are looking for a MUA - look no further - Christina is your woman! I will be hiring her for every event I attend going forward! Thank you so much, Christina!

le again due to covid and they had availability for my new date. When I was able to book Christina I was very excited especially when I saw her van. My hair and makeup was everything I expected and more. Even my entourages hair and make up was gorgeous. We had amazing photos and videos in their mobile van which was really fun. I love the team that Christina had on my wedding day. We had so much fun with her team they were so amazing and fun to be around with. The champagne that Christina bought was also really good. I also love the fact that my bridal package came with Lashes. It was a nice relaxing day getting my Lashes down on the week of the wedding. Hiring instant Pretty Lashes was one of the best things I did for my wedding. Everyone's hair and makeup was gorgeous and I can't wait to see my photos. Thank you Christina to you and your team. You guys were amazing. Best way to end 2021. P.S. I still have my Lashes on and I'm loving every bit of it.

WOWWW!! I can’t even begin to tell you how AMAZING Christina and Erin are!!! Christina was VERY communicative and responsive with me when booking the trial and day of appointment, ...

she sent my paperwork and it was clearly laid out how much I owed for the deposit and the day of. When I went for my trial I was so amazed by her BEAUTIFUL setup in her van. It was so clean, stylish, organized, and she even let me pick the music to listen to while she did my makeup☺️I felt like I was getting a massage on my face when she was doing my makeup. She was so incredibly gentle and kind. Even if she had to move my face or tell me to “look this way” or “that way” she was AWESOME! Erin came in to do my hair and she made MAGIC happen. My hair was pretty short and I brought a picture of a hair style that I wanted (of someone with longer hair), she did the most beautiful work!! I enjoyed my time with the two of them so much! On my wedding day it was even more fun!! We got to setup in a big room and and they just went to work on making me look beautiful! I’ve never gotten so many compliments on my look before and it made me feel like a QUEEN! I shared with Christina after the trial that I would like more lashes and eyeliner and she made me look STUNNING!! My makeup exceeded my expectations, I was so so happy with how everything turned out❤️ Erin did a PHENOMENAL job with my hair! Omgosh the magic that girl does is like WHOA!! HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend these two🥰 We’ll be doing our engagement photos in a few months and I’ll be hiring the same crew! Yes we did it backwards 😂

s ready at the time we needed. She is an amazing makeup artist and really gets to know you and connects with you. She even brought us a bag of snacks and some champagne. Christina also really pays attention to what you need, For example, my skin is REALLY sensitive and she was able to work with my skin type. At one point my eye was tearing and she gave me a little fan to stop the tearing it helped so much. If I dod not have that fan who knows how much more my eye would have been crying. Oh and she has a makeup van that pretty much goes anywhere. If, you are still reading this review and you have not booked her yet you need to go do that now and not think twice about it.

I had the opportunity to work with Christina per our planner’s recommendation (planner was the amazing Denise of Denise Lillie engagements). I completed a makeup trial with Christ...

ina (as well as a hair trial). I did not really know that I could ask for different looks during the makeup trial – I would encourage you to do this to compare / contrast a few different options. In any case, Christina took her time and created a natural glowy look for me that lasted all day. On the wedding day, due to a miscommunication with my planner *oops*, Christina ended up at the wrong place (ie up a mountain at the venue when I was getting ready in Palo Alto). Despite this, she rushed back with a great attitude and made it to the hotel in time to work through her list of people. She quickly set up and got to work. My makeup looked flawless all day and I ended up amping it up just slightly to create a more va va voom look without going overboard. I was particular about choosing a makeup artist that had my skin color as there are nuances to working with certain complexions that I did not want to risk. The only word of advice I have is for unaware brides like myself, it would be helpful if she gave some info about the trial process (since I had no clue I definitely did not make the most of it) so folks know to ask for different looks etc. But that is also on me, so I can’t knock her for it, I just think it would be a nice touch  Definitely select inspo images and try out a few looks for your trial. Make sure your bridal party all has inspo images so you don’t burn time on changing their makeup. Also highly recommend getting lash extensions. I’m pretty low maintenance, however, Christina recommends these (she also provides this service). Since I live in NYC, I got extensions from someone that was recommended by a friend and it was the best “treat yo self” thing I did before the wedding. Not only did I wake up looking GREAT the week of the wedding and the week after during the honeymoon, I was able to wear no makeup most of the time (with the exception of our welcome event and the wedding itself). Great for my complexion and an amazing secret when you’re short on time and running around like a mad woman. While I cannot speak to Christina’s skill here, her reviews are great and I recommend giving it a try as it looks much better than false eyelashes, feels more natural, and can look good for at least a month if you’re careful. I supplemented Christina’s service with Julie from A List, who did the rest of my bridal party’s hair and makeup (looked amazing but not as warm and cute as Christina). As for hair, Christina partners with other artists to make this happen. I was extremely disappointed with my hair trial. The girl who did my hair didn’t even let me see the style before undoing it…what? Nor did it look like the inspo image I showed her. Luckily it worked out in the end but had I not had a friend who did hair (and it was epic so it worked out!), it would have resulted in me having to book another trip to SF for a subsequent hair trial, which would have been terrible! I suggest you save your hair trial fee and look to a company that specializes in hair (one where you can see some previous work going into it). In any case, Christina is lovely and wonderful to work with, super calming and friendly on the day of when you need it the most. I highly recommend selecting her for your makeup needs!
