## How I Found the Best Wedding Shoes for Brides

Like I said, finding the perfect pair of bridal shoes isn't an easy task. The good news? I put in the work so that you don't have to (you're welcome). I started by interviewing real brides and asking them to review the wedding shoes they chose in relation to several categories: break-in time, comfort for long periods of time, quality worth the cost, wearability in the future, trendiness and overall style. From there, I took to sites like Reddit and Tiktok to determine what shoes are generating the most buzz. After reading over 300 online reviews, I can confidently say that I've narrowed down the 15 best shoes for weddings. Not only are these bridal shoes highly rated, but they also have plenty of reviews from real customers (so when I say these are the best, you don't have to take just my word for it).

**Standout review:** "So good I own it several times over! I have the Sarah Flint Perfect Pump in gray, black, red, espresso and beautiful limited edition styles I own from their holiday drops. It is my go-to pump and more comfortable than pumps I've paid more for." —Meghan D, [witwhimsy.com](https://witwhimsy.com/sarah-flint-shoes-review/)

Whether you're planning a seaside ceremony or simply want to avoid a potential fiasco walking down the aisle in heels (we feel you there), [wedding sandals](https://www.theknot.com/content/summer-sandals-to-shop-now) are the way to go. This pair features adjustable ankle straps that were designed with all-day comfort in mind. These [strappy wedding shoes](https://www.theknot.com/content/strappy-wedding-shoes) also have padded soles and walkable 2.5-inch block heels. Of course, we can't go without mentioning those gorgeous crystal-embellished buckles that give the pair an ultra-luxe look that's perfect for your big day.

**Standout review:** "I am admittedly obsessed with Margaux shoes and own an obscene amount, which I have no plans on stopping. This pair offers all of the Margaux comfort in a lower heel that is more suitable for many daytime events, yet still looks great at night. The first day I received them, I wore them to a reception and dinner that was six hours and my feet felt great! I was standing or dancing most of the time and my feet were so comfortable, just like with the rest of my beautiful Margaux's." —Christine, [margauxny.com](https://margauxny.com/collections/the-lena-sandal/products/the-lena-sandal-ivory-satin?variant=43783720632489)

Whoever said "beauty is pain" clearly never tried on these comfy bridal ballet flats. With low 0.5-inch heels, they were designed to make walking down the aisle a breeze. You'll also be thankful for their heavily cushioned leather soles and adjustable ankle straps when it comes time to bust a move on the dance floor. Plus, their illusion mesh upper graced with delicate Alencon lace gives these [wedding flats](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-day-flats) a distinctly bridal look we love.

**Standout review:** "I searched high and low for bridal flats that would fit my criteria of beautiful, but low and comfortable for all day wear. I kept thinking I would find a cheaper option, but nothing I tried worked out. Finally decided to splurge on these and am so glad I did. I ordered 7.5 which is my standard dress shoe size and they fit well. I will probably wear them around my apartment for a day to break them in but honestly I'm not sure they even need it!" —Rachel C, [bellabelleshoes.com](https://www.bellabelleshoes.com/collections/wedding-flats/products/lace-wedding-ballet-flats-alicia-ivory)

Let's be real here, _you're a gift._ So, why not get wrapped up in a bow for your big day? These white stilettos are an ideal way to *tie* your wedding look together—and not just because they feature detachable sashes that can be tied around the ankle in a bow. Their bold style is guaranteed to elevate any outfit, even after the wedding. Plus, because the bows are detachable, you're really getting two looks for the price of one.

**Editor's pick:** "I wore these pumps for my fall wedding and would absolutely recommend them. Not only did they provide some style versatility (ribbon or no ribbon, the choice is yours!), but they were also comfy enough to wear for 12+ hours continuously." —[MaryKate Callahan](https://www.theknot.com/content/author/marykate-callahan?srsltid=AfmBOoq-Oy2sVaNec58ux90FDtaYA4K5oSimF9kmV6vjRzKFhsdyLNG1), Director of Content Strategy at The Knot

It's no mystery why these classic [block-heel wedding shoes](https://www.theknot.com/content/block-heel-wedding-shoes) from Nina are bestsellers. Brides in the review section are raving about the comfort they offer. Some even said they bought the pair for their ceremony with plans of changing into flats for the reception, but that they didn't even have to—there were no blisters, bruises or discomfort whatsoever. That's all thanks to their unique design which was made to contour the foot and provide support in all the right places. Plus, their thick block heel allows you to balance much easier than your average stiletto would.

**Standout review:** "These were the perfect wedding heels! I had an outdoor wedding with lots of elevation change, grass and rocks at my venue and I was able to wear these shoes the entire night without any problems. They have a very stable block heel and ankle wrap. The materials used did not give me a single blister." —Ashlyn, nina.com

**Size range:** 5–11 (Wide Available) | **Heel height:** 2.5 in.

**Editor's pick:** "Even though I'm not a bride, I am a frequent wedding guest who *loves* heels. But what I don't love is when my shoes give me blisters, or feel too painful to keep on for a late night of dancing. That's why my go-to wedding shoes are Birdy Grey's Julia chunky heel. I love the modern look of the rounded heel, which gives support and stability thanks to its wide base. The design also offers comfy padding under the ball of your foot, meaning you can leave these heels on all day (and all night!) without needing a break. (Trust me, I've been there.) Plus, with a price tag under $50, you can't beat it." —[Sarah Hanlon](https://www.theknot.com/content/author/sarah-hanlon?srsltid=AfmBOor3VzRBLSU3ksjS02q5_m0-SmG4JMJ_53ZEU_JAvcSyuC3Y8q-t), Entertainment and Celebrity Editor at The Knot
