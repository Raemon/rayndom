Given the recommended timeline for purchasing a wedding dress, bridal fashion trends aren't always the easiest to keep up with. Who's to say the up-and-coming accessory you fall in love with won't feel tired once you finally get to wear it 10 months later? The bridal scarf, however, is one trend that continues to feel relevant season after season. Over the past few years, the drapey, ethereal [veil alternative](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-veil-alternatives) has been seen in the wedding day wardrobes of celebrities like Alex Cooper and AnnaSophia Robb (both of whom wore dresses by Danielle Frankel) and has continued to bubble up in the latest collections of designers like Monique Lhuillier, Katherine Tash and Alexandra Grecco. The scarf's consistent reign as the "It" bridal accessory makes sense—it has a modern, high-fashion feel that's just as regal and dramatic as a wedding veil but a bit less fussy.

It's hard to pinpoint when the scarf truly began gaining momentum in the world of Western fashion, though we could definitely give some credit to Princess Diana's iconic red carpet moment at the Cannes Film Festival in 1987. But even back then, the royal's baby blue tulle dress and matching scarf by Catherine Walker wasn't anything new—it was a look that drew inspiration from centuries of South Asian tradition. Indian wedding dress designer, [Harleen Kaur](https://www.harleenkaur.us/), emphasizes that when elements like this are adopted as fashion statements, it's important that the cultural context isn't stripped away. "It's exciting to see mainstream bridal fashion take inspiration from South Asian traditions—but even more meaningful when it's done with an understanding and respect for where it comes from," she says. Scroll ahead for a deeper dive into the cultural significance and history of this [wedding dress trend](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-dress-trends), browse hand-picked shopping recommendations and read my advice for pulling it off yourself.

## Behind the Bridal Scarf Trend

When a trend has staying power, it's often because it's far more timeless than you might think. This is certainly the case with the bridal scarf, a [wedding dress accessory](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-accessories-trends) trend that's heavily inspired by South Asian accessories like the dupatta. A Hindu-Urdu word that combines "du" (meaning "two" or "double") and "patta" (meaning "strip of cloth"), a dupatta is a staple in traditional [Indian attire](https://www.theknot.com/content/what-to-wear-indian-wedding) and has been worn by South Asian women for centuries. That said, the accessory was never merely about adding modesty or style to an [Indian wedding dress](https://www.theknot.com/content/indian-wedding-dresses). "While it's trending now in Western bridal fashion, for many of us, the dupatta has always held meaning far beyond aesthetics. It's something we wear for religious and cultural reasons, often passed down through generations or styled with intention for significant life events like weddings," says Kaur.

Today, brides of all backgrounds are reimagining the accessory in a modern way, whether it's to give a subtle nod to their heritage or simply add an elegant touch to their wedding gown. To clarify, anyone can wear a bridal scarf. The key is to give recognition to the hands that made it— _this_ is the difference between appreciation and appropriation. "While fashion trends come and go, garments like the dupatta carry stories, memories and values that run deep for so many of us," says Kaur. "So if you're inspired by South Asian elements like the 'bridal scarf,' take a moment to learn about where it comes from—it makes wearing it all the more special. And for those of us who grew up with it, it's a reminder that our traditions continue to influence and inspire the world in beautiful ways."

## How to Pull Off a Wedding Dress and Scarf

Itching to try out this trend on your wedding day? If you have a [bridal stylist](https://www.theknot.com/content/working-with-a-wedding-stylist), they'll be a huge help in pulling your scarf bridal look together. If not, scroll through the expert-backed tips ahead to nail the accessory trend yourself.

### Create a Balanced Look

The most important thing to keep in mind for pulling off a wedding dress with a scarf is that the two should feel cohesive. A simple neckline (think strapless or off the shoulder) will make for the most seamless combo, and the scarf's fabric and color should either match or complement your gown's. Though, if your dress is fairly minimal, a scarf with intricate details like embellishments, lace or embroidery will make for a beautiful finishing touch.

### Make It Your Own

Just like with a traditional wedding veil, a bridal scarf presents a great opportunity for personalization. You could embroider your partner's initials, your wedding date or even a mantra onto the border, or you could craft your own scarf entirely out of a relative's wedding veil or dress.

### Use It for a Second Look

If you'd rather wear a traditional veil for your ceremony or simply prefer to keep your dress as the center of attention, try adding a bridal scarf to your look for the reception. This is a perfect way to incorporate the trend without too much commitment, and it will keep your look feeling fresh throughout the night—no changing room required.

Simple as it may be, this tulle bridal neck scarf looks far more elevated than its $38 price tag suggests. According to the reviews, it's "so dreamy" and "worth the buy."

[$38 | Lulus](https://lulusfashionloungellc.sjv.io/c/64733/1810759/21545?subId1=TK-bridal-scarf&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lulus.com%2Fproducts%2Fcascading-romance-white-tulle-veil-scarf%2F2585491.html)
