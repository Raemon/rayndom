_Photo: Miss to Mrs Box_

The Miss to Mrs Box subscription is a fan favorite and for good reason. From the initial Keep Calm & Plan On box for those who are [just engaged](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-planning-tips-to-get-organized) to the Honeymooners box that arrives closer to your wedding day, each box in the series is carefully themed to match your planning stage. As such, deliveries are customized to your wedding date so if you're a year away, you'll receive a bride-to-be box every month, but if it's two years away you can stagger them to be bimonthly. Boxes include robes, a planner, vow books, hairpins, photobooth props and more. Each box is packed with six to eight products, giving you up to $150 in value. It's pure fun, for a fraction of the price.

## Bridal Subscription Box FAQs 

Whether you're treating yourself or looking for a [gift for a newly engaged friend](https://www.theknot.com/content/engaged-friend-gift-guide), a bridal subscription box is a great way to celebrate. Here's what you need to know before you pick the perfect one.

### What is a bridal subscription box? 

A bridal subscription box is a curated package of gifts delivered to your door on a consistent schedule as you plan your wedding. Sign up for a month-to-month service or prepay for up to 12 months of boxes depending on your budget and length of your engagement. Each box is designed to include fun to-be-wed items and planning products. A bride box gives you something to look forward to each month (aside from your upcoming nuptials, of course).

### What usually comes in a bridal subscription box? 

Bridal subscription boxes are full of delightful surprises that could include planning notebooks, [engaged AF](https://www.theknot.com/content/best-engaged-af-products) swag, personalized tumblers, body scrubs, stylish jewelry or a set of champagne flutes. Some subscriptions also send items for your bachelorette party and honeymoon as you get closer to your wedding date. Many boxes include anywhere from five to eight items that are tailored to your wedding timeline.

### How much do bridal subscription boxes cost?

Bridal subscription box costs range depending on the brand and membership tier you choose. On average, you can expect to pay around $30 to $60 per delivery. The great thing about subscriptions is that the value of the products is usually much higher than what you pay, making them a smart (and fun) investment during your wedding journey. 

### Are bridal subscription boxes worth it?

If you love a good surprise and want to add extra fun to your wedding countdown, bridal subscription boxes are perfect for you. Each delivery, you'll be treated to celebratory gifts like a ring dish and "bride" or "groom" luggage tags that get you excited for your next chapter. They can also introduce you to useful products and ideas for your wedding, often at a better value than if you bought everything individually. The only catch is that since you can't always choose what's inside, there's a chance the items may not fit your needs or taste. Of course, you can always regift anything you don't use, and typically you can pause or cancel your subscription at any time. Overall, the excitement, convenience and thoughtful variety make them well worth it for most engaged couples.
