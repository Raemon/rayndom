If I could give more than a 5 star rating I would! I could RAVE on and on about Will Mankin & the Karen Bevels team, but I will try and highlight the most important things. My hu...

sband and I booked KB to do the catering for our wedding in fall of 2019. At that time, Will Mankin who was our point of contact for KB, offered his services as a day of coordinator and we had decided to take him up on that. Fast forward a few months to the beginning of COVID. Will was incredibly understanding and accommodating when we had to move our wedding not once but three times. I know this wasn't an easy time for them either, but they never made it seem that way. About 4 months prior to our actual wedding date, Will and I spoke very regularly and met in person multiple times. He managed not only the food but all the flatware rentals, bar rentals, etc. His depth of knowledge in this space made it very easy for me, he knew all the questions to ask and all the details that would need to be ironed out. The day of our wedding ran smoothly because of Will and his team. He had picked up all of our wedding decor earlier in the week and his team set-up everything, and more importantly they were incredibly self sufficient! The entire team was very personable, we had multiple people come up to us during the night to say how great they were. They managed the timeline magnificently, all the clean up, and so many small details in between. They made it possible for my husband and I to focus on our day and not worry about any of the logistics. Now, the food. How often do you leave a wedding and say 'that food was really good?' Ours was that wedding! And it wasn't just one item that stood out, it was everything. We were told later that people were darting around the cocktail hour look for more trays of the lobster mac & cheese because it was that tasty! The main reason that we picked KB was because our tasting with them was so fantastic, and they had so many options of dishes to choose from. It can be hard to scale food, but they know how to do it. Pricing. KB was one of the most reasonable as far as price. Beyond that, Will made so many changes for us, with no push back or frustration. At the end of it all, I really saw the value in the money we spent with them. The last part of my review is for Will as our day of coordinator, (DOC). If you are reading this review you are probably planning an event and you know that it isn't easy. The money we spent on catering & DOC was the best money we spent for our wedding. Will has a calm demeanor which was very helpful to me, since I am a bit more high strung. He listened to our vision and helped make our plans happen! He was thoughtful, detail oriented, and really took pride in making sure that we and our guests had an amazing day. We truly can't thank this team enough for all they did. I honestly hope this review shows what great hands you can be in with KB & team!

caterers, I can see that Will went above and beyond to help our couple and make their wedding day great. He was helpful and great to work with throughout the planning process and also on the day of the wedding. The entire team was great to work with on the day and the food was also delicious! As a planner, or as a couple, you want to know you have a solid team of vendors working together to make your wedding day amazing. Will and his team were a big part of that, and I will definitely recommend them to future couples and other planners.

rns. They made sure there would be enough food, considering that we wanted a cocktail-type reception with small-plates rather than a sit-down dinner. They were able to accommodate our need for a fully vegetarian menu with gluten-free options. The food was delicious! The day of the wedding, Connie made sure that we had enough snacks in our Bride and Groom getting ready rooms and made sure we were in the right place at the right time. She was amazing! We need to give Will a special shout-out because he also did month-of wedding coordination for us and made sure that all the various vendors were able to work together smoothly. They made the wedding a successful event!

ion. Karen is a consummate professional who is absolutely awesome at translating the customer's vision to reality. Every detail was on point. It was a great pleasure to work with Satahe who was the lead person for the day of my wedding. They transformed our peaceful garden into a majestic venue. Everyone commented on the awesome food. No matter what your food selection, Karen Bevels delivers!!! She handled not only the food, but also the design, flowers, and rentals!!! For me Karen Bevels Catering was one stop shopping. I will most certainly use Karen Bevels Catering for my future events. Can't say enough!! the best experience of my wedding planning.

and thoughtful in their interactions with this harried bride. They answered all my questions, brought up their own concerns, and were enthusiastic about the wedding ideas that I had. Sometimes I really had to follow up on my questions, or they might go unanswered, but if you're more or less on the ball, I don't think that would be a big problem. Karen's staff was really wonderful the night of the event--friendly, pleasant, professional. I'm really grateful to Karen and her company for the wonderful job they did.
