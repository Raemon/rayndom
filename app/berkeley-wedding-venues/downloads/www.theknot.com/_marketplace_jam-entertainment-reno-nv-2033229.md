From our very first meeting with Jerod, we knew we wanted to work with JAM Entertainment for our DJ/MC, and Photobooth vendors. He was very personable, organized, and very passiona...

te about what he does. He made a very good first impression and had plenty of ideas to share to help with the wedding planning process. The app is unique and was very easy to use and help set up a great wedding timeline. You can add songs and rearrange segments of your timeline on your phone or on a desktop. It was easy to share the events to other people such as your partner or a wedding planner if you have one. The photobooth was a hit in our weeding! It was fully customizable, and we were able to do physical prints and digital copies for our guests. The lines were longer than the bar! The dance floor was alive the whole night. We received so many compliments from our guests. "Dancing in the Clouds" was a simple addition that added a very romantic element to our first dance and "The Love Story" added a personal touch and helped show our guest the magic to how we got to where we are. When a majority of our guest had already left before the planned grand exit, Jerod was able to change the timeline quickly and smoothly to a final couple’s dance and a final group dance. I didn’t even realize it was a last-minute change with how well it was executed. We HIGHLY recommend JAM Entertainment.

Patricia! Thank you so much for this amazing review. Your wedding at the the Elm Estate ...

in Reno was next level. From the moment we sat down and discussed your vision, I knew we could bring it to life. I wish more couples would take advantage of the venue meetings and planning session. I believe it was a huge part in making the wedding epic. I am so happy "The Love Story" was a part of your wedding. I loved sharing all the little personal details. And wow. You are right! The photo booth never saw less than 30 people in line all night. Thank you again for trusting us here at JAM Entertainment! It was truly an honor!

I really appreciated the time we spent planning together. Staying connected in the weeks leading up to your wedding helped everything come together smoothly, and seeing it all unfold was such a joy. Your kind words about the Master of Ceremonies role mean a lot to me. My goal is always to guide the flow and support the two of you while keeping the focus fully on your celebration, and I am so glad that came through. Thank you again for letting us be part of such a meaningful day. I wish you both a lifetime filled with joy, love, and moments that feel just as unforgettable as that night.

truly understand us and created moments that we’ll never forget. It wasn’t just music — it was the feeling, the emotion, and the joy that carried through the entire day.

Helping every couple feel seen, celebrated, and completely themselves will always be at the heart of JAM Entertainment. It was an honor to be part of your wedding and to help create an experience that reflected who you are. I wish you both a lifetime filled with joy, laughter, and love that keeps growing stronger every year. — Jerod, Owner, JAM Entertainment 🎶📸

The app provided was also a total game-changer — it made personalizing our day so easy and fun while helping us stay organized and was easy to communicate exactly what we wanted.

am love what they do and care about doing a perfect job...while making it look like a breeze. A DJ is a unique vendor on your wedding day because they literally and figuratively set the tone for the event and then keep the party going as smoothly as possible, which can be hard to do with multiple other vendors (and opinionated family members). I think the most important thing I was looking for was someone we could trust to stay on top of the timeline but who also really "got" us and our musical taste. Jerod *married* these two priorities beautifully and we could not be happier with the result on our wedding day. I wish we had more events to host so we could hire JAM!!

k with and chat with, very low stress because I truly felt that they were ON IT - but not aggressive. In planning they went above and beyond to be sure we had all of our questions answered in a timely manner, and helped us build so much excitement for our wedding day! During the actual wedding, Noah matched our groups vibes flawlessly, spoke with a fun and friendly yet professional tone, I couldn’t have asked for more. I didn’t have to even think once about what music was playing or what was being announced - to me a sign that he and this team know exactly what they are doing. Noah read our rather variable crowd and chose the perfect songs to get everyone out on the dance floor having an incredible time. He kept song choices easily within our preferences but covered all the bases of music (in our opinion). You know it’s good when half the wedding is on the dance floor singing along all together, dancing like there’s no tomorrow. Whatever your needs are for music (and beyond, this is the right choice. They are friendly, professional, easy to work with, on top of everything in a timely manner, you cannot go wrong with JAM!

If you are looking for an incredible DJ to truly make your wedding incredible, look no further than JAM Entertainment! Jerod was the most amazing DJ! From the first day I met him a...

t a wedding fair in Reno, I knew I had to have him DJ my wedding. His energy is what truly makes your wedding a party. He engages with the audience so your guests feel good and included.. he livens up the music so that everyone is enjoying the dance floor. He made my bouquet toss special and made my husband blush during the garder toss! Throughout the whole planning process, Jerod made it so easy! We went through my timeline, talked about the walk through for the Processional, and he had the BEST app for organizing all the music I wanted throughout the day. Jerod Arreguini is the most incredible human being! He is kind, reliable, and truly understands how to make your wedding magical. I highly recommend him for your wedding! Thank you Jerod for everything!

My husband and I are so blessed to be able to have Jerod for our wedding! We had so much fun as well as our guests! When we had our first meeting with Jerod, we already knew that w...

e were in good hands as he was very thorough with what he envisioned for our wedding. We were very much on the same page when we told him that we wanted to have a disney-themed wedding and he shared the same love for Disney like we did. He has an an app that is easy to navigate and helped us plan every little detail with music and helped us formulate a timeline of our wedding details. The app has questions that we needed to answer and we had a meeting before our wedding date that goes over those questions, which helped make the perfect wedding timeline. One thing that was important to us is for us to have “dancing in the clouds” for our first dance. This is a service he offers in one of his packages. He put a lot of effort in mediating with our wedding venue coordinator as they had a hard rule about not doing this. He sent a lot of emails/calls to them but ultimately, they said no but we really appreciated the effort he put. I know Jerod will fight for you to make your wedding day special and that’s what he did to make our disney-themed wedding a reality!

We cannot recommend Jerod enough! Jerod was scheduled to be our DJ for our wedding last June. When we met with him, we knew immediately that he would be a good fit. He was engaging...

and funny, but also took the time to listen to what we wanted and was very thoughtful in his questions and responses. We also valued his transparency when he shared that he was more expensive than other DJs, but that we would get the utmost in quality, value, and attention. And, boy, was he right! He set up a program for us to easily and accessibly choose songs and organize the evening’s events so that he could facilitate them and keep us on track. Additionally, he was communicative and set up a follow-up meeting a week before the wedding to make sure everything was in order. And then, the worst happened… After avoiding it for over two and half years, I got COVID three days before our wedding and we had to cancel. It was devastating. We were well outside of the cancellation policy, and while some other DJs might have just taken the money, Jerod recognized that this was an extreme (and extremely disappointing situation) and was very kind to us. He said that if there was an event in the future we were hosting on a day he wasn’t booked, he would come back and DJ. My husband and I are very very into Halloween, so we decided to throw a Post-Mortem Wedding/Halloween Party! The joke was “the wedding may have died, but the party came back from the DEAD!” Jerod was, luckily, not booked, and was able to DJ. Not only did he curate an epic Halloween playlist while people had cocktails and food and got everyone fully hyped on the dance floor, but he also came in costume (the Phantom of the Opera!) and tricked out the house with his amazing lights. (We had lights as part of our “package”, but he went SUPER full-out and it was AMAZING!) Also, turns out my friend had organized a flash-mob performance of Thriller for us, and she said that Jerod was amazing to work with, communicated quickly with her, and made it happen easily. My last comment would be that Jerod was incredibly intuitive to the group; just as people needed an energetic shift or were over a song, he seemed to just sense it and transitioned fluidly. For weeks, literally for weeks, my friends all brought up how amazing our DJ was and what an epic party it had been. Take my advice: BOOK JEROD!!! You will be in exceptionally professional, thoughtful, and fabulous hands!

Jerrod is the absolute best DJ! Our wedding was a blast and it was all due to the awesomeness that is Jerod Arreguini. Jerod was super professional, extremely organized and really ...

made our night perfect. The song planning app was the original reason we were sold on hiring Jerod, but there are endless reasons why we’d hire him again if we ever get the chance. The app was super easy to use. It allowed us to choose songs for each special moment as well as add dozens of songs for cocktail hour, dinner and of course open dancing. We were able to completely customize the songs we wanted to be apart of our day. The app also made it really easy to give Jerod notes on who was doing speeches, the lineup of our wedding party for the ceremony and grand entrance and so much more, down to every detail. Our wedding was in Mammoth Lakes and we had a difficult time finding someone local for our day. We reached out to a few DJs in Tahoe and as soon as we met Jerod via zoom we knew he was our guy. He played all the songs we requested, song transitions were smooth and he was a great sport when a tipsy guest repeatedly pulled him onto the dance floor. Instead of an awkward moment with a tipsy guest he busted some great dance moves and really got our guests pumped. Jerod was everything we hoped for and more in a DJ. He was quick to answer emails/texts and the dance floor was full the entire night until the very last song. We had a small wedding of 40 people and we weren’t expecting a ton of dancing, but he somehow had people on the dance floor we never expected to see there. We had an unforgettable night and people wouldn’t stop telling us how it was the best wedding they had been to. After the wedding we reached out to Jerod asking if he might have a playlist of the songs that were actually played throughout the day and he was super quick to send us our very own Spotify playlist. Being able to relive the day through the music and memories of dancing to those songs was really special for us and shows how accommodating and willing to go above and beyond Jerod’s willing to go for his clients. We can’t thank you enough, Jerod!

Jerod is, in a word, FANTASTIC!! Jerod was the DJ at our wedding in August 2021 in Graeagle, CA and we had the most amazing experience with him as our DJ. From our initial call bef...

ore we booked, to the planning process, and then finally to the day of our wedding, everything was absolutely perfect. For starters, the planning process was seamless. When planning a wedding there are a million things to think about and plan so the app that Jerod uses to help couples plan their day and choose what songs they want and when is a god-send. The day of the wedding we had a last-minute change and wanted our officiant to use a lapel mic instead of a hand-held mic and Jerod was able to quickly pivot like the professional he is and provided a lapel mic for our ceremony. He also had some great tips to make the ceremony music flow incredibly well. It’s evident that he understand what works and what does not at a wedding! Jerod arrived early and did extensive sound checks to ensure that everything would operate seamlessly, which it did!! His MC set up is fabulous as well - it’s a very clean, sleek, and not bulky set up, which might not seem like a huge deal, but when we got our reception pictures back I was so happy that there wasn’t an eye-sore of a DJ set up in the background of pictures! He has a great light addition to his booth as well that makes it look really great! Last but not least: the music. It’s not an exaggeration to say that the majority of our guests made comments to us complimenting Jerod for keeping the party going, people on the dance floor, and the overall music selection. Yes, we added a lot of songs we wanted to the app, but the way that Jerod made them all flow to ensure the party never stopped and everyone was having a great time is the mark of a true professional. He also added a bunch of songs that I would have never thought about were such great additions and total crowd pleasers! You will make a million decisions when planning a wedding, but the moments you and your guests will remember most are the ones where the DJ plays as a pivotal role, so if you’re looking for someone who is going to execute the day perfectly, make your life easier, and give you peace of mind about things going smoothly, I cannot recommend Jerod enough!!

It was spectacular, having that bit of magic added so much to my wedding and was very appreciated by myself, my husband, and all the guests. Jerod makes sure every moment is exactly what the bride and groom want. He feels out the crowed and will adjust if needed. Jerod has an app to help with the planning process, this is extremely helpful and fun to add songs for the special day. Everyone loved his high energy and how he kept everyone engaged and informed through the whole wedding. If you are looking for a DJ who is interested in what you want and sticks to it, he’s the DJ for you. Jerod helped make my day the most magical.
