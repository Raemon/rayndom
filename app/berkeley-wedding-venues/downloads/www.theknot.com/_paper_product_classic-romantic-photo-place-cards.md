Details

These place cards showcase each guest’s name in flowing cursive script paired with a clean serif typeface. A slim rectangular border frames the design, with a small swirling flourish at the bottom for a hint of romantic charm. A plain background keeps the look simple and timeless.   
Select how many cards you would like printed and after you’ve placed your order, a designer will send you a spreadsheet to fill out your guests' names. After you’ve placed your order, send your completed spreadsheet to help@theknot.com with your order number included in your email, and a designer will send you a digital proof of all of your cards before printing.   
A variety of meal icons are now available! If you would like to include meal info on your place cards, simply enter your guests’ meal choices to your spreadsheet, ordered by meal preference - and our designers will include them in your digital proofs. 

**Size:** 3.5 x 5 inches
