It's important to note that this wedding cost breakdown is based on national averages and should simply be used as a starting point. You might also notice that the wedding budget percentages don't add up to 100%—and that's on purpose! Your final wedding cost breakdown ultimately depends on a number of factors, like how much money you and your S.O. have to spend, the location and time of year you're getting married, and your top priorities. This will inform which expenses you ultimately include in your budget... which will be different for every couple. This wedding budget breakdown is designed to be used as a baseline to give you a general understanding of how to allocate your funds.

## Wedding Budget Breakdown

So what do realistic wedding budget percentages look like? We've gathered information on example wedding budgets from real couples to help you plan your own wedding expenses. Let's dive into more of the specifics of a typical wedding budget. Of note: While the categories and percentages below paint a broad picture of what you can plan on for your wedding budget, not everyone hires every vendor. As such, once you've taken a peek at this general guidance, meander over to [The Knot Budget Advisor](https://www.theknot.com/wedding-budget) to customize your budget based on which pros you're hiring to align with your priorities.

## Creating a Wedding Budget Considerations

Now that you know what a typical wedding budget breakdown looks like, it's crucial to familiarize yourself with the top things to keep in mind when allocating your wedding expenses. As mentioned above, several factors go into how you actually spend your money. This means that no two sample wedding budgets will look the same. Here are key allocation factors to consider while creating a wedding budget: 

### What You Can Afford

It's imperative to be honest about your wedding day expectations from the start. What you can actually afford will impact your wedding expenses breakdown. "The best way to [stay on budget](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-many-couples-spend-over-budget) is to be realistic about what you are willing to pay each step of the way, from the venue to the vendors to your dress and accessories," explains Kristen Gall, retail expert and President of [Rakuten Rewards](https://www.rakuten.com/). "Couples may need to compromise and cut back on spending in one area to get what they want in another. For example, you might cut back on the floral spend to account for your catering bill." Sit down with your S.O., as well as anyone else who you might be [asking for wedding money](https://www.theknot.com/content/in-laws-havent-contributed-to-wedding), and have an honest conversation about what you have to spend, and how you should prioritize the wedding budgeting.

### The Guest List Size

[Who you invite to the wedding](https://www.theknot.com/content/who-to-invite-to-wedding) and the size of your wedding both have a massive impact on the amount you'll spend on your wedding budget. There's a per-head cost for food and liquor, and these two are among the biggest expenses in a typical wedding budget. As a result, consider inviting fewer folks than the [average guest list size](https://www.theknot.com/content/average-wedding-guest-list-size) to decrease your costs. Plus, with a smaller wedding, you can think strategically about [how to save on wedding costs](https://www.theknot.com/content/ways-to-save-money-on-wedding) ranging from decor and stationery to favors and rentals because you won't need as much of everything.

### The Destination and Venue

Some cities and towns are just more expensive than others. New York, Chicago and Los Angeles are the obvious culprits, but small towns and remote destinations can entail greater costs if things like flowers and talent have to come from afar. Tourist towns can also increase your wedding price tag during peak travel season. Likewise, while [finding reception venues near you](https://www.theknot.com/content/finding-a-wedding-reception-location), you'll discover that some spots are more expensive than others. Some—such as a city park—come with no (or low) fees, while others, like a grand ballroom, might cost you the equivalent of a year's college tuition. Also, be aware that many [popular wedding venues](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/wedding-reception-venues) have headcount minimums, meaning they won't host a wedding that's too small, and some may also have a per-head minimum that requires your event to be a certain size.

### The Date and Time

Highly sought-after seasons and days of the week are pricier for obvious reasons (supply and demand!). An event hosted in the middle of [wedding season](https://www.theknot.com/content/is-there-an-off-season-for-weddings), which spans May through October, will likely come with higher wedding costs. An evening wedding reception is usually more expensive than a brunch or afternoon reception. Similarly, weddings on Saturdays and Sundays tend to be more costly than those hosted on weekdays.

### The Wedding Style

What's your dream [wedding style](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-theme-ideas)? Generally speaking, the more formal the affair, the more expensive. This is because you might find yourself [hiring a wedding decorator](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-decorators) and matching the site, food and musical entertainment to the overall upscale [wedding vibe](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-vibes-meaning). The outlay for a full six-course meal is typically greater than for a cocktail wedding with mostly hors d'oeuvres; the fee for a 12-piece band may be greater than that for a DJ or quartet; all-out decor like lighting, specialty linens and dramatic floral displays can also run up the wedding budget.

## Common Wedding Budget Mistakes to Avoid

As a budding wedding budget expert, you're well on your way to completing your wedding expense breakdown. The final wedding budget planning step is to familiarize yourself with potential wedding budget mistakes you'll want to avoid. Here's the good news: We know the most common wedding budget planning mistakes couples often make, which means we can help prevent you from following in other couples' footsteps. Below, we explain where people go wrong, and how to avoid doing it yourself.

### 1\. Not Using a Budget Advisor 

There's a reason that every iconic story involves a guide—from the Jedi to Gandalf. Why? Because everyone can benefit from some guidance. When it comes to nailing your wedding price breakdown, look to a tool like [The Knot Budget Advisor](https://www.theknot.com/wedding-budget) to act as your coach (and we'll be your cheerleaders). 

[Money Advice You'll Wanna Save](https://www.theknot.com/wedding-budget)

### 2\. Not Allocating Funds Correctly

When it comes to [financing a wedding](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-to-pay-for-a-wedding), figure out how much you'll need to spend to get what you want. Set your expectations accordingly, and use our wedding budget breakdown above as a guide. Plus, if you're paying for the honeymoon yourselves, remember to budget for that as well. You could even set up a [cash registry](https://www.theknot.com/content/cash-registry-the-newlywed-fund) or [a honeymoon fund](https://www.theknot.com/content/best-honeymoon-registries) on your [wedding registry](https://www.theknot.com/registry) to crowdsource some extra cash. You'll be thankful you did!

### 3\. Not Keeping Track of Your Spending

Put your accounting skills to the test by deciding on a budgeting system to track all the money coming in and out. The easiest way? [The Knot Wedding Budget Advisor ](https://www.theknot.com/wedding-budget)we mentioned above does more than just educate you on typical wedding budget percentages, local vendor pricing and how real couples are dropping their dollars. It also allows you to track and edit what you end up spending. Schedule frequent check-ins with your partner, as well as anyone else financially contributing to your big day, to ensure everyone is on the same page and your spending is on track. "I recommend that you sit down for a monthly reconciliation to document what was spent out of your budget," says Andrew Westlin, Certified Financial Planner at [Betterment](https://www.betterment.com/). "That also gives you and your partner dedicated time to discuss and align on your plan."

### 4\. Forgetting to Budget for Unexpected Costs & Extras

Knowing all the costs upfront will guarantee that your planned wedding budget can actually cover it all. Of course, it's nearly impossible to budget for every single [unforeseen hidden cost](https://www.theknot.com/content/hidden-wedding-costs), but having some extra space built out in your budget will save you in the long run. "Even the best planners who budget early on might forget to add items or will inevitably have things they need to add on," Westlin adds. "A buffer gives you flexibility, which is such a powerful tool when it comes to financial planning."

We recommend researching potential hidden fees that can add up over time to prevent unexpected surprises while [wedding planning](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-to-plan-a-wedding). It's also important to read [wedding vendor contracts](https://www.theknot.com/content/a-complete-guide-to-wedding-vendor-contracts) carefully to scope out potential hidden fees. Here are common extras to keep in mind:

  * **Overtime:** If the party's still going strong on the dance floor, an extra 45 minutes may whiz by—but you'll pay in overtime costs for everyone from the photographer to the venue manager. If you suspect the wedding may go long, work overtime costs into your budget. And if you don't use it, it'll be a nice surprise chunk of cash.
  * **Service fees:** The service charge is an additional fee venues charge to cover their own cost of hiring servers, coat checkers, and bathroom and parking attendants, which typically amounts to 20%–25% of the event's total food and drink fee.
  * **Prewedding trials:** A florist's demo may be gratis the first time, but if you make repeated changes, you might risk being billed. And you'll definitely want to factor in your hair trial with your stylist into your overall hair budget.
  * **Extra decorations:** Things like stamps for the [RSVP cards](https://www.theknot.com/paper/rsvp-cards), ribbons for the favors and marriage license fees seem so small that you can shrug them off, but like any costs, they add up. Going "just over budget" in a few different categories with a vague plan of making it up somewhere else can push you past your limit.
  * **Gratuities and vendor tips:** From the sexton who cleans the church to the hotel steward who delivers your welcome bags, even conservative tipping can add hundreds to your wedding cost. Use this [vendor tipping cheat sheet](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-vendor-tipping-cheat-sheet) to make sure to account for these costs in your initial budget. You should also set aside at least $800 for gratuities (the additional amount given to your wedding vendors for their hard work). As with a waiter or your hairdresser, tips are generally expected unless you're unhappy with the service.



### 5\. Not Allowing Room for Overspending

If you account for some budget wiggle room, then you'll never actually blow your budget. "Couples should plan ahead by aligning on what they are willing to spend, including the max that they will spend for each vendor, and cross-reference that with their overall budget," warns Gall. Try to earmark at least 5% of your budget for unforeseen costs. Want to learn more? **Here's everything you need to know about**[**how many couples typically go over budget.**](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-many-couples-spend-over-budget)

### 6\. Not Taking Advantage of Rewards Programs

Take advantage of budgeting and money management tricks along the way. Put all your wedding money in one separate account, so you can easily track additions and withdrawals without getting it confused with your day-to-day funds. We also recommend familiarizing yourself with the [best credit cards for wedding planning](https://www.theknot.com/content/best-credit-cards-for-wedding-planning) and opening an account with the one that most suits your needs. Then, pay for as many of your expenses as possible on that one credit card that offers benefits like mileage, rewards or cashback. Make sure everyone making purchases (your partner, mom and so on) is all on the same card system, allowing you to benefit from the rewards and also from the easy tracking of your purchases. To avoid credit card fees, pay the bill off in full each month.

Gall also suggests using smart-shopping programs to make the most out of your purchases. "Use cash-back programs, like Rakuten, on your wedding purchases," she recommends, noting that such sites offer this benefit on top of deals and credit card rewards. "These programs are a great way to maximize savings." Plus, there are plenty of [free wedding items](https://www.theknot.com/content/free-wedding-items) that couples can avail themselves of to save even more money. 

### 7\. Not Discussing Priorities From the Start

Whatever your budget, you don't have to resort to [last-minute DIY projects](https://www.theknot.com/content/diy-wedding-dos-and-donts) to come in on target. Instead, be honest about what's most important to everyone involved up-front. Pick your top three priorities and allocate a little extra money for them (such as your attire, catering and band). Next, pick the three things that come lowest on your priority list and budget accordingly.

Also, avoid going all-out on details that aren't a top priority to you. Free yourself of the pressure to upgrade and instead make honest choices based on what you want. As a general rule, before you sign a contract, look through the itemized list of what you're buying and ask yourself, "Will anyone notice if we don't do this?"

Keeping your priorities in check is the best way to avoid taking on too much debt as well. "You don't want to enter your marriage by taking on debt, as it can cause stress," warns Westlin. "Your wedding is an incredible life milestone, but you need to have a realistic understanding of your financial picture and also prioritize what is most important." However, if you see fit, [wedding loans](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-loans-personal-wedding-costs) are a possibility to consider. 

### 8\. Not Being Tough on the Guest List

It can be challenging, but one of the fastest and most effective ways to lower your wedding cost is by [narrowing the guest list down](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-to-cut-wedding-guest-list). For example, if catering is $100 a head, taking 10 guests off the guest count can save you $1,000. Also, consider the size of your wedding party; gifts and transportation are cheaper for three than for 10.

### 9\. Forgetting to Invest In Insurance

Here's the truth: [special event insurance](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-insurance-101) is absolutely worth the investment. "Special event coverage that protects in the event of a cancellation or postponement—for whatever reason—is important to consider," says Laura Piwinski, Insurance Product Director at Lemonade. She notes that insurance (such as liability coverage) is particularly important for any wedding events held at home, like a backyard ceremony. But beyond that, some vendors will require insurance coverage too.

Even if it seems like wedding insurance is one area you can skip, consider the [wedding planning stress](https://www.theknot.com/content/ways-to-beat-wedding-stress) you'll avoid by knowing your celebration will be protected no matter what. "The sense of security insurance provides, like knowing deposits or non-refundable payments are covered, will make the planning process that much easier," Piwinski adds.

### 10\. Not Being Realistic

As mentioned above, it's easy to oversimplify some of the financial aspects of a wedding. To stay on top of your wedding budget, you have to be realistic about what each element generally costs. Once you know this, it's easier to allocate funds from your budget.

There's a lot to keep track of when it comes to wedding budget planning, but it doesn't have to be stressful. Follow our tips above and you'll be more equipped to stay within your means.
