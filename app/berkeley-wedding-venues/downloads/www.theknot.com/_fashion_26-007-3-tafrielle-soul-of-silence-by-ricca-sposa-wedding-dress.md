Description

This enchanting transformable gown, crafted from milk-toned taffeta, captures the essence of modern fairytale elegance. The off-shoulder neckline gracefully frames the collarbones, while soft draping along the structured corset highlights the waist, adding a delicate romanticism to the silhouette. In its initial form, the gown features a playful short balloon skirt with a voluminous shape, adorned with statement bows on each side. But the true magic lies in its transformation: a detachable long underskirt, designed to impress with its rich volume, turns the dress into a regal, floor-length princess gown with a dramatic train.
