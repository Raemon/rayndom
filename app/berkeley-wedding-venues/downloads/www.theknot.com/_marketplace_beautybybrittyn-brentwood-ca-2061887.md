loved the photos I saw of her work on IG. I don’t generally wear a lot of makeup and wanted to recognize myself when I looked at my pictures. So it was really important to me that my make up look more on the natural side. I feel like she nailed it. I could not have been happier with my makeup on the day of my wedding. She was able to accommodate me, my bridal party, Mother and MIL. Brittyn and her assistant arrived on time day of and made everyone look amazing. Thank you Brittyn!
