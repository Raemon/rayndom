I cannot stress enough how wonderful Kinsley Couture made the entire process for finding my dream wedding dress. From setting up an online appointment and sending over styles that ...

I wanted to try, it was very easy to communicate with them by phone or email. When walking into the store, you are immediately drawn to all of the beautiful wedding dresses from the many designers that the store carries. I was shown to my fitting area with my mom and sister and met by my bridal assistant for the day, Macario. He was so welcoming, calming, and patient in asking about my taste in wedding dresses and asking questions to get an idea of the type of dress I wanted. I can confidently say that every dress that Macario picked for me perfectly nailed what I had envisioned. He brought the most beautiful dresses and constantly checked in with how I was feeling, if I needed a break, or if I wanted to try on a dress again to compare. I cannot thank Macario enough for his patience and care in allowing me to say yes to my dress. Kinsley Couture also works with tailors in their store for their initial appointment and I cannot stress enough how highly skilled Jila was. So thank you Kinsley Couture for offering such an amazing experience and allowing me to find the dress of my dreams for my special day!

Kinsley Couture is the absolute best and I am so grateful for everyone who helped me get my dream wedding dress. Sierra was an absolute gem and she and the team made the whole expe...

rience so easy. They have such incredible designers and were even able to order a dress from Eva Lendel for me that was pretty much impossible to find elsewhere. I had a very particular aesthetic in mind for my Parisian wedding and Kinsley Couture made it a reality. The Eva Lendel Molly was the only choice, even though they humored me while I tried everything else on, and even though the designer couldn’t send any samples the Kinsley Couture team made it easy enough to order it sight unseen. It was clear they have a great working relationship with the designers. Kinsley Couture also brought in such a wonderful seamstress, Jila Tailoring Studios, who altered the dress perfectly and was such a pleasure to work with. They also have amazing accessories. Instead of a veil I went with the Bromelia pearl headband by Maria Elena and it went so well with the dress. For the rehearsal dinner, I went with the Untamed Petal Clara and it was such a perfect dress for Paris. Reflecting back on the experience, I cannot put into words how grateful I am for the team at Kinsley Couture. Thank you so much!

They messed up my measurements, refused to bear the cost of their mistake, and repeatedly broke promises to help make it better. I spent an $2,200 beyond what they advertised when ...

most alterations cost $150-$600. For a $11K dress, this was not a luxury experience. Beware when you're told "if anything goes wrong, this can all be altered!" Why are you getting a custom fit if you fork out $2000 in alterations? 1\. When they measured my long sleeve topper, they didn't measure the arm hole. I asked them if they needed this, and they said it wasn't necessary. It was necessary! 2\. I ordered my dress in Jan 2021. It was supposed to arrive at the beginning of Aug. I had to proactively email to discover it was delayed due to shipping problems. It arrived in mid-September. I had 1.5 months for alterations. (Google says "you should come in for your fitting two months in advance, but not less than 1 month before".) There was no way that I would have been able to solve the subsequent fiasco if my Oct wedding had not been delayed due to COVID. 3\. Sept 2021: My measurements changed. The bust increased by 1-2 cm, and the waist increased by 4cm. The dress was gaping open at the back 4-5 inches. I insisted that they measured incorrectly, since I had not gained weight. They said the dress has no affordances because it has to be tight. (Google says most dresses should be able to let out 1-2 inches from seams). The sales told me not to worry, they would find a solution, and found the situation surprising. 4\. Nov 2021: I was given 3 options: (a) The designer can add additional panels for a large cost. (b) The designer can replace the corset entirely for $3080. The owner offered to cover 20% saving $616. (c) A seamstress can add a lace-up corset to the back for cheaper. I was unhappy with all of the choices. 5\. They spent Sept 2021 to October 2022 "discussing more options with the designer", only to leave me in the same position. The seamstress would now get fabric from the designer and add the panels. I felt like I was backed into a corner to pick this option. 6\. Nov 2022: When I went to my first fitting with the seamstress, the store manager insulted me by asking if I had lost any weight hopefully, as if that was the solution they had been searching for. Unhappy that a year later, I would be expected to bear the full cost, I asked them to honor the offer to cover 20% of the corset cost. This was verbally accepted. I wasn't necessarily looking for a discount, but some sort of acknowledgement of my frustration. 7\. March 2023: After the alterations finished, they now do not want to pay the 20% cost of the alterations (~$400). They told me that they supposedly halved the cost of fabric. This was never communicated to me when I paid for the fabric, so I do not know how I am supposed to trust that. I paid $418 for the alteration fabric and then another $1800 for alterations with a seamstress, for a total of $2218. This was not significantly cheaper than if I had picked (b) which would have ended up being $2464. I'm frustrated that to the end, they would leave a sour taste. I had so many back and forth email conversations and phone calls, and drove from SF to Walnut Creek way too many times than I needed to end up with the same results. 2 years later, none of the solutions offered were anything different than "Just pay for expensive alterations".

To say that Kinsley James SAVED my wedding day is an understatement. I had always dreamed of a big poofy princess ballgown (a bit hard to find right now with the sleeker styles bei...

ng more desirable). I ordered a custom gown which ended up being a complete disaster in every way. It was 27 days before my wedding and I was gownless...a brides worst nightmare. Alexis and Nicole at Kinsley James in Walnut Creek successfully helped me find the gown of my dreams off the rack and even rushed to get me a little extra lace to have off the shoulder sleeves put on. I commend the entire store on there teamwork fitting me in extremely last minute for a fitting and being able to accommodate my extra requests. EVERYONE commented on how incredible my dress was and I still have people asking me where I got it. My gown nightmare turned into a blessing in disguise. Not only did they manage to literally save the day, but the boutique is so cute! They offer champagne and are all the sweetest girls! You can't go wrong with any of the stylists here! Thank you all again so very much!

Hands down, I had the best wedding dress shopping experience at Kinsley James in Walnut Creek compared to all bridal boutiques I had visited, even compared to ones out of state. I ...

went to KJ multiple times, and every encounter was great. The overall atmosphere of the boutique, the attentiveness from the entire staff, and the dress & accessory collections they had to offer made a huge difference in my experience for choosing a dress. The quality of the dresses are incredible and surpass any other store I had been to. The owner, Dawn and all the KJ staff are fabulous and truly exemplify customer service. They really listen to your personal preferences and understand your budget; they are not just trying to make a sale. I worked mostly with Tiffany, and she was such a sweetheart. She helped me find the perfect dress for me, made by Rivini. I did not truly understand when everyone had told me "when you know, you know" after putting on the perfect dress until I had experienced it myself. It was actually not the dress I imagined buying, but immediately once I tried it on, I saw myself marrying the man of my dreams in it. It matched my venues and personality exactly. I also was able to purchase my veil and belt made by Anne Barge at their accessory trunk show. I even found a last minute hair piece there the week before our wedding, and it all came together better than I imagined. I received so many compliments on my dress from all of our family and friends, and I could not have had my dreams come true without Kinsley James!

gaged a week before. So while waiting for a seat outside the restaurant my sister Candy pointed out "Omg that bridal place looks so cute" and i looked at it and it is indeed look elegant and lots of beautiful wedding gowns on display. We made an appt for our first visit to shop for wedding dresses few months later. I have been to numerous bridal salon in LA and this one is by far why favorite and I am so happy to have chosen them to find my perfect dress. Kelsey helped me all the way and she went above and beyond trying to find the best gown for me that fits my budget, the look i want and what i am looking for. Their seamstress work on altering my gown was superb. Hands down to all the girls that work there. Whenever i go down for trial and fitting the girls are super friendly, drinks and champagne on the house and absolutely the best ambience while getting your fitting.

, most places I went to, they rushed me, were rude about trying to make me make a decision and made the entire experience just not so pleasant. I just felt pressure or they just didn't get what I wanted. Kinsley James was completely different. They were amazing! They are so chill about the whole process. I went once and thought I found the one, but wasn't sure. I came back a second time and finally found the one! Both appointments were long and they gave me the time, attention and patience I needed to make such a huge decision.

My experience at Kinsley James was awesome. This was the second bridal shop I went to, and I only had a vague idea of what I wanted. They ended up taking my very vague descriptions...

and a few photos, and selected a handful of dresses that were exactly my style. I quickly got down to 2 dresses, but couldn't decide between the 2. They were so patient as I tried each on probably 5 times trying to decide. The dress I ended up choosing was something I probably never would have picked on my own, but they did such a great job at understanding my style and aesthetic. In other words, the picked the perfect dress I never knew I wanted. I ended up getting my veil at KJ too. The feel of the shop is rustic but elegant, and not stuffy. I felt comfortable and that they were fully focused on me and my group. The dress came in a timely fashion. I LOVED my dress so much! It was comfortable and still looked amazing at the end of the night. I wish I could wear it again!

rted shopping for wedding dresses last fall 2016 in mostly SF upscale bridal boutiques. Although, I found some dresses that I liked, I did not find "the ONE". I did not want to settle for a dress. My friend had suggest Kinsley James and although further than I wanted to drive, I booked an appointment. Just by coincidence, the same day of my appointment was a trunk show with one of my favorite designers Liancarlo. The store is absolutely gorgeous, open, light and airy. The dresses they have are amazing. They have a smaller selection but all couture/high end designers. It made dress shopping a lot easier and less overwhelming. They also, always offer some bubbly while shopping which is such a nice touch! I had the pleasure of working with Alexia for my wedding dress and Rachel for my accessories such as the veil and belt. Both consultants were great, never felt rushed by them, knew exactly what to pull from what I was describing and were calm, professional and most importantly nice. I ended up picking a Liancarlo dress and since a rep from Liancarlo was there during my appointment, they were able to customize a perfect gown for me. I loved a lace from one of their gowns and the skirt of another gown, and voila, they were able to customize it for me completely, including lengthening the train and shortening the torso for my stature. I felt like a million bucks on my wedding day and thank Kinsley James for being apart of my special day!

The Kinsley James staff made me and my family feel special the moment we walked through the door. They asked the right questions to find my perfect dress, treated us like royalty, ...

gave everyone a glass of champagne to celebrate, and provided amazing advice for my wedding day. The staff was incredible and everyone could tell that they sincerely loved helping brides find their dress. I thought it would take months to find a dress, but their expertise helped us find a dress in one weekend! They provide the most unique, romantic, and breathtaking selection of wedding dresses. I also got the opportunity to meet the amazing designer Renee Pawele who helped me find my veil and jewelry. The Kinsley James staff made the experience a memory that my mom and I will always treasure. I have been recommending to newly engaged friends and family to find their dress at Kinsley James.

I wanted to buy a Galia Lahav dress for my wedding and Kinsley James was the only place in northern CA that carried this particular designer. We made an appointment to try on dress...

es and we arrived to the salon, I was so impressed by the dress selection and the service! I found a dress that i really liked, but the price was insane, so I decided to keep looking. About a month or so later I got an email saying that Kinsley James was having a sample sale - my aunt offered to get there at 0500 to wait in line (she got there and was #3 in line) - after a few hours the line was wrapped around the building. I was welcomed back into the store when they opened and the same girl who assisted me for my first appointment remembered me and was helping us out. I found an amazing dress that another bride had worn and was putting up for sale - It was Galia and it was perfect! I bought the dress and was given referrals on where to have alterations and cleaning - both vendors (Jila for the alterations and elegance preserved) were the best. When everything was done, it looked like a completely new dress! At the wedding all of the guests commented on how beautiful my dress was and one girl even wanted to buy it! If you want a dress that no one has ever seen before, come here, it's the best dress salon in northern California.

The ladies at Kinsley James are a dream to work with! I went in with a good idea of what I wanted and they had already put several dresses of that style aside for me. The staff was...

incredibly welcoming to my family and friends that were also in attendance. I ended up ordering a dress which had to be made out of the country and Kinsley James was so great about keeping me in the loop as to my dress' progress and arrival. When my dress arrived I went to try it on and was running incredibly late due to traffic, the staff and the seamstress both stayed late for me even though I had completely missed my appointment time. Their recommended seamstress is seriously a miracle worker, she was able to make some last minute alterations to my dress two days before my wedding when I went to pick it up. Overall, my experience here was absolutely wonderful!!!

had the most perfect day at Kinsley James. The ladies were SO helpful (Alexia was my gal) and so patient with me (I'm incredibly into fashion so this was the number one important ...

choice and I probably sent them 70 emails). She helped me try on all TEN of the dresses on my pinterest list and was so helpful in helping me narrow it down, and didn't AT ALL try to upsell me on dresses closer to the high end of my budget (I actually came in under). The store is also super well put together and made for a super pleasurable experience. I went for a trunk show as well and it really I think says something about this shop that they are one of the first in the US to carry Galia Lahav which is my favorite designer. The rep they had there was also amazing and super knowledgable on the brand and made me feel so beautiful. I got the perfect dress I was beyond impressed/pleased with the whole experience. One of the best days of my life! I will update with more information as the dress arrives and process goes on, but I can't even imagine it getting any better! I'll have to save my "say yes to the dress" moment photo til after the wedding day, but it was such a special moment thanks in NO small part to the ladies at Kinsley James :)

ern and not frilly or lacy, which unfortunately is extremely difficult to find. By the time I walked into Kinsley James, I had already tried on about 50 dresses or so, and was feeling very frustrated by the entire experience. My mom and I were actually in Walnut Creek to visit another bridal salon and we didn’t even have an appointment at Kinsley James, but the staff was able to fit us in due to some last minute cancellations (we got really lucky, apparently they usually have a waiting list!). When I walked in, Amanda and Amber immediately made me feel comfortable. They took the time to ask me about the style I wanted for the dress and my vision for the wedding, and helped me pull dresses that would fit. With each dress, they made sure to ask me how I felt about it, trying to understand my style and what I liked or didn’t like about each dress. Overall, they had better and more interesting dresses than I’d seen anywhere else by a long shot (including the Rivini dress I ended up buying). After trying on several, I narrowed it down to two that I was really torn between. At no point did they pressure me to make a decision (they were EXTREMELY patient as I kept trying on the two dresses and comparing them side by side), and they even encouraged me to take time to think about it. They recommended a great lunch spot, and after lunch we came back and picked a dress! It aligned perfectly with my vision and the staff made sure that they did everything they could to help me get there. I really can’t recommend Kinsley James enough!

es before I visited this salon. After only one visit, I was able to find many pieces of the accessories (sash, headpiece, and bracelet) I wanted. They have a beautiful selection of jewelry varying in styles and prices and the staff was so friendly and helpful. Every bride should check out this salon.

This bridal boutique is simply stunning. I love how modern, upscale and elegant this salon is. I saw some of their dresses on Pinterest and knew that I had to come and see it for m...

yself. I went to 3 other salons prior to coming to Kinsley James and left all of them saying "no that's not it". Once I walked in to Kinsley James I didnt want to leave. From the second I walked in I knew i was going to find my dress there. Dawn was amazing to work with. Actually everyone was amazing to work with. I had a clear vision of what I wanted my dress to look like and Dawn really helped me find the perfect dress. My dress designer Olya went out of her way to customize the dress for me and make my vision come true. I was looking for a unique and modern dress and that's exactly what I got. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking to purchase a wedding dress.

Kinsley James is simply amazing! KJ was my first stop when I started my dress shopping and I could not have had a better experience! I went shopping with my mom and 2 sisters and w...

e felt like celebrities throughout the whole process. We received exceptional service from Alexia and the rest of the KJ team. Alexia actually picked my dress! I was a little unsure about trying it on but followed her lead and fell in love as soon as we put it on. We went to another salon after my appointment because I was nervous that I hadn't tried on enough dresses. We didn't receive half the service at this other salon, so we immediately went back to KJ to meet with Alexia, put my dress back on and the decision was made! The KJ team brought our champagne to toast this special moment. Alexia provided updates on my dress during the ordering process and always made sure to say hello every time I came in for alterations. I so appreciate the constant updates and excellent customer service I received. Not only is the service unbeatable at KJ, they have the most beautiful gowns to choose from! I could not be happier with my dress and I am so glad that I found it at Kinsley James.

nitely had this on my list of places to try on dresses and ended up buying my beautiful gown during a Ravini trunk show weekend. Katie and her team are so incredibly helpful! Katie is not only fun and hilarious, but she was so personable and made me feel so comfortable. Each KJ girl that I met through the entirety of my dress are so educated on the designers and their inventory, not to mention they make you feel so comfortable in the salon. I don't think words can evoke how memorable this experience was for such an important time in my (& husbands) life. From their customer service, to the attention of detail and fashionable recommendations, my experience was seamless. These girls know what their doing and how to make it enjoyable for each bride! My bridesmaids, mom, mother-in-law, and of course myself, had a blast and it was a truly (positive) memorable experience within this craziness of wedding planning. I can't say thank you enough!!

When I first started looking for dresses in Oct 2014, I was overwhelmed. I am not one of those girls who has been dreaming about her wedding since I was five (wish I had been- woul...

d have made some decisions a lot easier). A co-worker suggested Kinsley James. So we decided to go there first for the 'bridal experience' and then go the less $$ places (or so I thought) next. Spoiler alert - I bought my dress, earrings, belt and veil from KJ and it was all amazing. From the moment my mom, sisters and I came to KJ, we were treated like VIPs. Maria asked about dresses and while she pulled a few dresses, we were offered champagne, water and appetizers. The store is beautiful with a long runway, large dressing rooms and many accessories to try on with your dress. On that first day at KJ, there were two dresses I loved but just was not sure (first time ever trying on dresses) so wanted to think about it. We went to lunch and then to our next appt where dresses were crammed together in plastic bags and the whole experience felt more like a cattle call than a dress shopping experience. We left feeling a bit dejected and exhausted from the rapid fire try on session (time limits to appts strictly enforced). Needless to say, there was no dress purchased. Throughout the next week, Maria and I talked and emailed about what I was looking for. She sent me a picture of a dress that was coming for a trunk show for a new designer they were starting to carry, Sareh Nouri, that weekend. When I looked at the picture, I knew it was it. I came in on Friday to try it on to be sure before dragging the family back up. The rep from the company was there too and very helpful. All it took was putting it on in the dressing room to know it was definitely it. My mom and sisters came back on Sunday and we greatly enjoyed the KJ experience one more time! When they dress arrived, we returned again to try on. I loved that they made a big deal about this day too - even though the dress was already purchased - this made it even more special. I ended up getting a beautiful pair of earrings, my veil and belt from KJ. Even the seamstress was top notch! I could not have asked for a better bridal experience and even though I worked mostly with Maria (absolutely amazing!) all the staff were very helpful and knowledgable. Kinsley James has incredible customer service all around. Next month, my mom, sisters and I return to do it all again for my younger sister! Maria was my first call and I'm excited to relive the KJ experience with my little sister and feel pretty confident that she'll find her perfect dress at Kinsley James as well!

I purchased my wedding dress at Kinsley James, after having visited a number of other stores in the Bay Area. The selection there was the largest, in terms of designers as well as...

styles. The service was also very good - my salesperson was very attentive, and helped me with the selection and fitting process. I do wish that there would have been tailoring services onsite; I was referred to an outside tailor. That said, it was a very good experience and I would recommend the store.

Amber and her team are absolutely AMAZING! When I was starting my dress process, they were (and I think still continue to be) the only vendor in the Bay Area that carries Galia...

Lahav, and I'm obsessed with Galia's unique dresses that marry sexiness and classiness. They had a trunk show for the newest collection, and I went in with my mom and my girlfriends wanting to try on a few of her styles. What I didn't know was that trunk shows samples really meant "runway sample size" and I'm a 12, so there was no way to shimmy those samples on. I tried on a range of other styles and brands, but just wasn't getting the "this is the dress" feeling. Amber had the idea to pull the Galia Lahav styles that I originally wanted to try, and pull everyone into the dressing room so that we could hold the dress up against my body to visualize the Dolce dress on me. I immediately got the "this is the dress, I feel like a bride!" feeling. I took some concepts from other Galia Lahav styles that I loved and customized the dress with my mom and Amber. Amber listened to what I wanted from the beginning, and was very focused on making sure I had the best chance to get what I wanted and wasn't pushy at all. Had it not been for her, I may not have ended up with my Galia Lahav. She and her team are customer-centric. My mom passed away shortly after we ordered the dress, so she wasn't able to see me in the wedding dress that she helped to customize, but I will never forget the experience we had together at Kinsley James. I'm getting my dress preserved (vendor recommended by KJ as well!) so that I can keep it as a family heirloom. I highly recommend Kinsley James for any future brides!

ey James. The dress selection is amazing and the ladies who work there are incredible. I was very picky about my dress and they worked with me to find the perfect one, essentially getting me a dress from a line that was not even available at other boutiques yet from one of the amazing Galia Lahav collections. They accommodated my needs and some strange requests every step of the way, including arranging for me to meet the designer at one point when I was traveling. I cannot say enough good things. Don't even think about going anywhere else.

Kinsley James is such a wonderful bridal salon. I first chose to shop there because they are the only salon in all of Northern CA to carry Galia Lahav. I could not have asked for...

a better experience. I had so much fun trying on many of their couture dresses. After finding my dream dress they were helpful every step of the way. They even gave me recommendations for companies to clean and preserve the dress after the wedding. I felt like the most beautiful bride and credit must be given to Kinsley James. The staff there made sure I was happy during the entire process. Thank you!!

definitely appreciated!! I was also provided with a gift bag! The Kingsley James Boutique is truly a gem, I love the intimacy of it! I was lucky enough to secure an appointment during Olia Zavozina's trunk show. Olia and Katie pulled a few gowns for me to try on, and sure enough, my perfect dress was in that group!! The dress is gorgeous and everyone loved it! I've been telling everyone where I purchased my dress and the awesome service that I received!!

If you just got engaged and are starting the hunt for a wedding dress, Kinsley James is your go-to bridal shop. I followed them on Facebook and Instagram before I started my dress ...

search, in addition to having attended several of their events and fashion shows as well. I knew this was the place where I would find my wedding dress. I booked their VIP appointment so that my mom, maid of honor and I could have the store all to ourselves for this memorable experience. I also brought a photographer to capture each magical moment. When I arrived Katie was there to greet me, along with the Sareh Nouri representative, the designer whose dresses I was most looking forward to trying on. They had a Sareh Nouri trunk show going on that weekend so I knew I would find the perfect dress. They had a gorgeous spread of delectable treats and goodies for me and my guests, and I was immediately whisked away to get my hair done by Taylor Cercone of I Do Dry Style in Lafayette. She did an amazing job and I truly felt like a bride. I was also given a bouquet so I could really achieve that true bridal look. Katie was so sweet and knowledgeable and helped me pick out the most stunning dresses. Everyone was so complimentary about every dress I tried on, it was so hard to choose! Katie and the Sareh Nouri rep suggested accessories to complete my look. As soon as I tried on THE DRESS, I knew it was THE ONE. Katie completed my look with a stunning belt by Untamed Petals and a custom Sareh Nouri cathedral length veil. This was a once-in-a-lifetime experience and I truly felt like a princess. I got married 2 weeks ago and the dress and accessories could not have been more perfect. Everything was exactly what I had been dreaming about my entire life and I owe it all to Kinsley James. There is no other place anyone should get their wedding gown.

ay too, it was our lucky day. The designer herself along with Katie actually helped me find a dress that would be within my budget. I wanted to be comfortable and have a simple design, no lace or anything. They listened and I didn't feel pressured at all, that is what I feel is great customer service. I found my dress, plus because I love sparkle, she suggested beautiful crystal buttons that would go down the back of the dress and I felt like it was the perfect unique touch. If I ever get married again (hahaha!), this is the boutique I would go to.

me I went into the shop, I was very impressed with the décor and the amazing selection of beautiful gowns. At my first appointment I found one dress that I really liked. I was with my sister and before I made a decision I wanted to bring my best friends back with me for a second opinion. At the second appointment a few weeks later a Rivini trunk show was taking place. Melissa, being super fabulous, remembered the style I was going for and greeted me with “I know you’re here to try on another dress but there is a beautiful dress here today, part of the truck show, that I think would look great on you…do you want to try it on?” Always keeping my options open, I agreed and boy was I glad she put me it. It eventually became the dress I would buy. The fact that she was able to see a dress and know that it was something that would appeal to me and my body time, was a wonderful reflection of how well the staff listen and get to know their brides. The team at Kinsley James is very knowledgeable. Melissa was incredibly patient with me. I also love that they allow you to take pictures, which was so important to me. Having the pictures of the two dresses I was debating between let me go home, review and make a really thoughtful decision. In having the time to think, I was never pressured by the staff to make a decision and Melissa would just send nice emails to check-in to see if I had any questions. After a few weeks I went back and purchased the gown and it felt GREAT! I looked an many salons across the Bay Area and Kinsley James was hands down the best. A great bonus is that they are in the East Bay (where I live) and saved me from having to go into San Francisco for fittings. Thank you Melissa and team for helping me find my perfect dress. I received so many compliments on my original, classy and timeless Rivini gown!

't find any others to be on the same level as Kinsley James in terms of customer service, ambiance of the store, and quality of the dresses. The ladies at Kinsley James were extremely accommodating from the start, even ordering in additional sizes from two designers so I could fully try on a few of the dresses I was seriously considering (other bridal stores refused to do this). When I made my first appointment, I was instantly set at ease--the bridal consultant was incredibly sweet and helpful, knew right away what styles would look great, really listened to me, and never put any pressure on me to buy. I loved the look and feel of the store as well--it is dreamy and romantic. I ended up buying my (second) dress there, and couldn't have been happier--it looked dynamite on my wedding day! On a side note, the outside seamstress they recommended (Bonnie) was excellent and a true professional. All it took was one fitting to get an incredible fit of the dress. Kinsley James really wrapped up the loose ends--they not only helped me find the perfect dress, but made sure to set me up with a seamstress who would give it the perfect fit.

end, and we all sipped champagne while I got to strut down their catwalk in some gorgeous dresses. I found my dream dress that night, and was lucky enough to meet the designer who was visiting from New York for a fashion show in San Francisco. Once the dress came in, Kinsley James was very flexible with times for me to have my first fitting, despite being very busy helping other brides. And we got the same royal treatment the second time around as we did our first visit. The dresses are high-end, so a little pricey, but they are all fabulous and the people at Kinsley James are wonderful to work with. Definitely recommend!
