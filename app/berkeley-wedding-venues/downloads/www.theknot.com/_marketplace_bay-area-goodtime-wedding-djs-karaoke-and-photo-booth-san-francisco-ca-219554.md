Mark Hester Power

Owner

Mark wanted to be a Dj from the time he was 10 years old. He studied communications and broadcasting at SF State. Mark first saw a mobile DJ in the late 1970's and decided to buy a DJ Mixer and put an ad in the local paper and founded the Marin Mobile Music Company in 1978, which was one of the first four Mobile Dj Companies in the Bay Area. Fast forward to 1984, after training more Djs and expanding to serve the entire Bay Area became the Goodtime Djs & Karaoke Now 31 years later, The Goodtime Djs have provided music for over 6000 weddings, parties and events.

Hired this company to DJ for our wedding, and though their rates were cheaper, we got what we paid for. Prior to the wedding, we had a very difficult time getting responses in ema...

il communications with Mark. Both us and our coordinator would need to send multiple emails over the course of weeks to get a response, and information on timing and coordination would not get through. We also got a call the Tuesday the week of the wedding saying that he had not received any of our forms, but we had submitted them literally months before on his platform that he made. Our biggest complaint is the day of the wedding, every song would play in it's entirety. This was unusual in a dance setting where a 4+ minute song would play all the way through. When we asked about it, we were told they did not have the software to blend songs together, which I assumed to be a core job of a DJ. They essentially put on a playlist that we had built and called it a day. This was further evidenced by finding that more often than not the DJ was away from equipment in other rooms during the dace section. This was highly disappointing. On more minor notes, they also failed to follow some of the playlist instructions that we provided through their own website. This included playing a different song for opening the dance floor, filtering genres of music we had added because of the age group, playing only clean-editted songs through no request of ours, and playing songs we specifically requested to save while the bride and groom were present while we were outside taking photos. They also failed to loop the song the bride was coming out to so there were ~10 seconds of silence when the song should have been playing (which was a pretty big portion of the bridal entrance) We have tried to reach out since the event to address these issues multiple times and have heard nothing back. I would feel comfortable endorsing them for providing sound equipment, but the actual DJ services were lacking.

ot of my questions, and helped us to create a plan of what songs we wanted to play for key parts beforehand. He did a great job playing what we requested and he even sang for a few songs which was an awesome surprise for us. I actually mistook his voice for Elvis at one point. Everyone loved it and he really got everyone out on the dance floor. You could tell he was very experienced at setting the mood and reading the audience. And he did a great job working with our coordinator to announce everything at the right times. The person who ran the photo booth that he partnered with was great too. I highly recommend good time DJ.

We hired Mark for our wedding day, to provide audio starting before our ceremony until the end of our reception. From the moment we spoke on the phone, we knew we were in the hands...

of a professional. His music library is EXTENSIVE, but it was fun to have full say over which songs were played and which weren't, and we've been told that our wedding music was some of the best our guests had heard! What was especially wonderful was, for my super-non-traditional bride-processional song, he was able to splice together an instrumental portion to create a completely seamless arrangement that actually came in handy, since I wound up at the altar a few seconds later than expected, and the music garnered a standing ovation - I kid you not! Overall, I wouldn't hesitate to hire Mark or any of his team members for a future event. From handling microphone placement to introductions to speeches, he maintained a lighthearted professionalism that kept myself and my husband at ease. If we could give more than 5 stars, we would!
