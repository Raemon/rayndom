Forget everything you've heard about wedding party attire "rules"—there really aren't any. These days matchy-matchy looks are entirely optional, so if you're wanting to mix things up a bit, we've got some ideas. It all comes down to curating the right combo of suits and dresses, considering factors like color, fabric and formalness. Here, we've paired some of our favorite looks from [Generation Tux](https://www.generationtux.com/?utm_source=theknot&utm_campaign=2026_brand-campaign&utm_medium=publishers&Ref_Source=publishers&RefDet1=theknot&RefDet2=prospecting&RefDet3=2026_brand-campaign&RefDet4=brand-integrated-static-article&RefDet5=5-ways-to-style-wedding-partyRefDet6=generation-tux) with their wide variety of colorful accessories to illustrate how playing with color can shake up your wedding party look. Generation Tux will even [send swatches straight to your door](https://generationtux.com/swatches?utm_source=theknot&utm_campaign=2026_brand-campaign&utm_medium=publishers&Ref_Source=publishers&RefDet1=theknot&RefDet2=prospecting&RefDet3=2026_brand-campaign&RefDet4=brand-integrated-static-article&RefDet5=5-ways-to-style-wedding-partyRefDet6=swatches), free of charge, so you can be sure you're getting a perfect match.

## **Different shades of the same color  
**

![Generation Tux Gray Sharkskin Suit with accessories](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/ad1bd275-1b69-4ca4-bcaf-44725e775c9c~rs_768.h)

**Color swatches:** 1\. Generation Tux wedgewood; 2. Generation Tux dusty blue; 3. Generation Tux marine

Have your heart set on one hue in particular, but still want some variety? Choose a core color and then explore options in lighter and darker shades. Bonus: This can make for a stunning ombre effect in your wedding photos. Your groomsmen can sport ties and accessories in a range of coordinating tones to echo the gradient, or stick to one shade with the groom standing out in a different variant.

## **All neutrals**

![Generation Tux Allure Dark Brown Suit with accessories](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/4261ed4f-2619-429a-8713-e81eafc34c8f~rs_768.h)

**Color swatches:** 1\. Generation Tux biscotti; 2. Generation Tux champagne; 3. Generation Tux latte

If bold hues aren't your thing, a more subtle, neutral palette might be your perfect match. Start with soft beiges and tans like portobello, latte or sand and accent with lighter or darker tones. This way, your wedding party can choose the neutral hue that suits them best for dresses or accessories like ties, vests and more. For a finishing touch, have the groomsmen wear dark brown suits that ground the palette.

## **Mixing prints and solids**

![Get the look: Generation Tux British Tan Suit with accessories](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/680af230-3ef0-4554-a18e-3b9efeea434f~rs_768.h)

**Color swatches:** 1\. Generation Tux chianti rose; 2. Generation Tux ballet; 3. bridesmaid dress inspiration

Floral bridesmaid dresses are trending and there's no reason groomsmen can't get in on the action. A unifying hue (like soft pink) brings the look together, but feel free to mix and match with accessories in floral prints, pin dot or coordinating solids. The key here is to combine prints in a similar tone for an eclectic look that still feels polished.

_Get the look:_ **Generation Tux**[British Tan Suit](https://generationtux.com/collection/tuxedos-and-suits/british-tan-notch-lapel-suit?utm_source=theknot&utm_campaign=2026_brand-campaign&utm_medium=publishers&Ref_Source=publishers&RefDet1=theknot&RefDet2=prospecting&RefDet3=2026_brand-campaign&RefDet4=brand-integrated-static-article&RefDet5=5-ways-to-style-wedding-partyRefDet6=british-tan-suit), [Pink Floral Self-Tie Tie](https://generationtux.com/collection/ties/pink-floral-self-tie-tie?utm_source=theknot&utm_campaign=2026_brand-campaign&utm_medium=publishers&Ref_Source=publishers&RefDet1=theknot&RefDet2=prospecting&RefDet3=2026_brand-campaign&RefDet4=brand-integrated-static-article&RefDet5=5-ways-to-style-wedding-partyRefDet6=pink-floral-self-tie-tie) or [Ballet Pin Dot Pre-Tied Bow Tie](https://generationtux.com/collection/ties/ballet-pin-dot-pre-tied-bow-tie?utm_source=theknot&utm_campaign=2026_brand-campaign&utm_medium=publishers&Ref_Source=publishers&RefDet1=theknot&RefDet2=prospecting&RefDet3=2026_brand-campaign&RefDet4=brand-integrated-static-article&RefDet5=5-ways-to-style-wedding-partyRefDet6=ballet-pin-dot-pre-tied-bow-tie)

## **Complementary colors**

![Generation Tux Black Peak Lapel Tuxedo with accessories](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/13e193ea-37aa-4d75-9b27-7d95c8c99253~rs_768.h)

**Color swatches:** 1\. Generation Tux peacock; 2. Generation Tux berry; 3. Generation Tux gem

Can't decide on just one shade? Go for a mix of colors in a similar category: like jewel tones, pastels or earth tones. Depending on what you're comfortable with, you can ask your wedding party to choose a look based on your guidelines, or assign everyone a specific shade. Either way, the result is a colorful assortment of festive attire. For the groomsmen, a goes-with-everything black tux can help tie the look together.

## **Mixing textures**

![Generation Tux Mystic Blue Suit with accessories](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/fbeb9db6-f6cd-4d5c-a4e7-632afc2490db~rs_768.h)

**Color swatches:** 1.**** Generation Tux wine

If you love the unified aesthetic of a wedding party all in the same hue, but still want to shake things up, try combining different textures and fabrics. Satin, velvet, chiffon and even sequin dresses and accessories can all add variation to a monochrome color palette. For the guys, a suit in a contrasting color is a stylish twist that adds dimension without straying from the theme.
