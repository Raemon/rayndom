While a bride's wedding gown is arguably one of the biggest sartorial decisions in the wedding planning process, there are others that deserve a decent amount of thought and time. Mothers of the groom play a key role in the wedding party and should also feel their best on the big day, so finding a gorgeous dress to don is of utmost importance. Where to begin the search for the perfect one, however—especially when it comes to something that will be seasonally appropriate for the cold-weather months—is often half the battle.

Before you dive into your search for mother-of-the-groom dresses for winter, take some time to consider the venue, vibe and [dress code](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-guest-attire-cheat-sheet) of the wedding. A tea-length LBD is fitting for a rooftop cocktail celebration, for example, while a floor-grazing gown is better suited for a black-tie ballroom affair. Another factor that's just as important to keep in mind is the weather. If you decide to go with something sleeveless or lightweight, you'll likely want to search for a coat or faux fur topper to match should the forecast call for extra-cold temps.

Now that you have an idea of the dress length and formality you should look for, think about the details you tend to like in a dress. Maybe you're partial to an off-the-shoulder neckline or A-line silhouette. And while you can never go wrong with something classic, don't be afraid to show off your personality and lean into the latest trends. Drop waists and asymmetric details are currently flooding the wedding-guest-dress scene, while burgundy is having a big moment. No matter what vibe you decide to go for, just make sure you get the "okay" from the couple, as they may have a specific color palette or theme in mind.
