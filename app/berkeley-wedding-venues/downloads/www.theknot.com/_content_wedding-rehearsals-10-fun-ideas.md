## Rehearsal Dinner Themes

Rehearsal dinner themes aren't required, but it doesn't hurt to think through a few if you want an evocative, cohesive atmosphere. And by the way, your rehearsal dinner theme doesn't have to go with your wedding theme (in fact, it's kind of fun to choose something totally different). Check out some of our favorite rehearsal dinner themes below.

[READ MORE Found: The Best Rehearsal Dinner Venues Near You ](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/rehearsal-dinners-bridal-showers)

### 1\. Celestial Rehearsal Dinner Theme

![Celestial Rehearsal Dinner Theme](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/57f705d8-41ff-48ac-a5d2-5c28f1f730e7~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1078.1437)

What's not to love about this modern celestial style? 3D stars made of different materials and sizes hung above the long table where guests dined during this Mexico wedding weekend. In addition to star lanterns, you can add some shimmer and sparkle to the room with gold flatware. And if you're interested in [rehearsal dinner games](https://www.theknot.com/content/rehearsal-dinner-games) at all, we think something related to the astrological signs of everyone at the event would be fun and fitting. Perhaps matching the sun sign to the guest? 

### 2\. Amalfi Coast Rehearsal Dinner Theme

![Amalfi Coast Rehearsal Dinner Theme](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/f22df52d-b2a0-4e31-9fcf-9658c6eafae3~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.768.1024)

_[Photo: Madeleine Collins Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/madeleine-collins-photography-laguna-beach-ca-1091021),__[Invitations: Emily Baird Design](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/emily-baird-design-washington-dc-870168)_

The bride and groom wanted to honor their Italian heritage with an Amalfi Coast-themed rehearsal dinner. Lemons were used as decor everywhere, bottles of olive oil as place cards, bright florals on every table and gelato for dessert (one of our fave ideas for a rehearsal dinner, especially if it's served from a cute gelato cart). Incorporating a few touches of blue and white along with your pops of lemon yellow definitely will help evoke the Amalfi region of Italy. You should also incorporate lemon into your dinner and dessert menu for the evening.

### 3\. Coastal Rehearsal Dinner Theme

![Coastal Rehearsal Dinner Theme](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/b8dc102f-321a-4c0c-b341-0b73273d2172~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.767.1023)

_Photo: Abby Jiu Photography_

Use neutral colors and botanicals to bring a beachy, coastal vibe to your rehearsal dinner tablescape. Tan chargers, herbs placed in sand bowls and decorative oysters also graced the rehearsal dinner tables at the event pictured above. Though a coastal theme can take many forms, from a nautical affair with lots of navy blue and rope details to a light and airy coastal grandma vibe, embracing your rehearsal dinner's seaside location will always be an easy win. (A rugged fisherman theme is one of the coolest groom's dinner ideas too). 

### 4\. Tomato Summer Rehearsal Dinner Theme

![Tomato Summer Rehearsal Dinner Theme](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/84948e2a-20fd-46d6-bad2-361ccf5d936b~rs_768.h-cr_0.17.1080.1457)

_[Photo: Twah Dougherty Photography](https://twahdougherty.com/)_

Tomato-season couples, (pairs getting hitched in July and August) this one's for you. Take advantage of the cool and colorful heirloom fruits that are ripe and ready during the late summer by interspersing them with meadow-y flowers to create a farm-fresh tablescape. Mix larger tomatoes with little ones on the vine and vary the hues you use. Serve dishes like tomato, peach and burrata salad, bruschetta and a classic gazpacho to showcase the theme across your menu. And this theme naturally leans into dinner party vibes, so don't forget the candles and cute, yet casual table linens. 

### 5\. Tropical Disco Rehearsal Dinner

![Tropical Disco Rehearsal Dinner](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/23bb8e45-4cf0-4114-9142-54504be17bb9~rs_768.h-cr_0.77.1080.1517)

_[Photo: Bailey Ann Original](https://baileyannoriginal.com/)_

If juicy tropical colors, shimmering metallic silver and maximalist [rehearsal dinner decorations](https://www.theknot.com/content/rehearsal-dinner-decorations) are your bag, give this theme a shot. Have a few disco balls spinning above your guests' heads and a few adorning the table beside funky, sculptural tropical flowers like anthurium and birds of paradise. For even more texture, bring bright tropical fruits like dragonfruit and pineapple into the tablescape. Carry the tones through to the table linens and you can even add silver serveware and glassware to complement your disco elements. And if you want to end the evening with a dance party, we're all for it.

### 6\. Grapes + Ikebana Florals

![Grapes + Ikebana Florals](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/f43355b9-d880-498c-b917-0ef91c1bdf4f~rs_768.h-cr_0.132.1458.2076)

_[Photo: Alasandra Photography](https://alasandraphotography.com/)_

Especially if your wedding skews more traditional, you might want to get funky with your flowers at your rehearsal dinner. Try something like mismatched, but coordinating stemmy ikebana arrangements with bunches of grapes threaded between them. Add a gently draped linen table runner for texture. 

### 7\. Handwritten Menus and Place Cards

![Handwritten Menus and Place Cards](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/d8c47f07-c681-4844-ac74-bf452c8c5cd8~rs_768.h-cr_0.121.1458.2065)

_[Photo: Rachel Leiner Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/rachel-leiner-photography-brooklyn-ny-2025841)_

Doodle/handwritten-style wedding stationery always feels effortlessly cool, especially when it appears as a poppy red accent, like on these place cards and dinner menus. We love how the simple ribbed bud vases filled with roses tie the color scheme together, and also the way the wiggled border on the placecards adds a little whimsy to an otherwise simple tablescape. 

### 8\. Bows on Candlesticks 

![Bows on Candlesticks](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/31dd09b3-c48a-48d3-aa1c-e7b8d4afb81d~rs_768.h-cr_0.3.1458.1947)

_[Photo: Brittany Barb Photography](https://www.brittanybarb.com/)_

Give this sweet and whimsical rehearsal dinner idea a shot if you're looking for a way to bring a touch of romance to your tablescape. Tying a simple ribbon around a taper candlestick softens the silhouette and adds a layer of texture. If you really want to go hard with the coquette vibes, tie some ribbons around the stems of your glassware too. 

### 9\. Love-Note Style Rehearsal Dinner Invitations

![Handwritten Love Note Rehearsal Dinner Invitations](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/ea1a78f4-6a98-4e36-9ba0-5f5af2bf79b6~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1200.1200)

_Photo: The Knot_

If you don't have time to hand write every one of your [rehearsal dinner invitations](https://www.theknot.com/paper/invitations/rehearsal-dinner), consider this lovely stationery style. The details of your event are elegantly relayed in script and formatted like a personal letter. You can also add a sweet photo of you and your partner on the back. 

[See This Design](https://www.theknot.com/paper/product/handwritten-love-note-rehearsal-dinner-invitations?v=6deecdbe-79ac-48de-8af1-e95c8bd1dbd7&q=100)

### 10\. Bonfire Activity Station

![Bonfire Activity Station](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/a1ff2619-0496-4e12-a964-ad2fe69a7098~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.768.1024)

_Photo: Kelly Anne Photography_

Cap off your rehearsal dinner with a fun bonfire for guests to enjoy. Set up a s'mores station so guests can snack on a sweet treat as they sit and enjoy the ambiance. You can also provide a basket of blankets to up the cozy factor. 

### 11\. Sailboat Setting

![Sailboat Setting](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/b754ad87-2ba5-472f-8146-6bff316c053f~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.750.1000)

Instead of hosting their rehearsal dinner on land, this couple took to the seas. The rehearsal dinner took place on a sailboat off the coast of Massachusetts. Opting for an "experiential" venue, so to speak, is a wonderful opportunity to offer guests a unique and memorable experience as a part of your celebration.

### 12\. Summer Camp Locale

![Summer Camp Locale](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/3df7e79d-1b47-41a9-8c80-5f028a641b8e~rs_768.h-cr_114.0.1410.972)

_[Photo: Bethany & Dan Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/bethany-and-dan-photography-portland-me-410767)_

If you're having a summer or autumn wedding and are in the market for a more laid-back rehearsal dinner structure, opt for a summer camp setting. This kind of venue is the perfect place to set up lots of lawn games to entertain your loved ones and a bountiful picnic table set with family-style dishes to be passed around. 

### 13\. Personalized Coasters

![Hand Drawn Cake Coasters](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/1710e8a0-0e51-4020-9384-8ef89432f778~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1200.1200)

_Photo: The Knot_

These personalized coasters, which are adorned with a sweet line drawing of a champagne tower, are the perfect semi-custom celebratory touch to your rehearsal dinner table. You can edit all of the text, so you can write something like "Jeff and Adam's Rehearsal Dinner" and add the date of the event. 

[See This Design](https://www.theknot.com/paper/product/hand-drawn-cake-coasters?v=9a9e12a4-1a5d-44e7-b48c-4a7269706940&q=6)

### 14\. Petite Centerpieces With Cosmos, Mums and Ranunculus

![Petite Centerpieces With Cosmos, Mums and Ranunculus](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/bf3b47f3-662c-4afb-952a-caa33c6f6f22~rs_768.h-cr_0.121.1458.2065)

_[Photo: Rachel Fosbenner Photography](https://rachelfosbenner.com/)_

Maybe you're going for lush and expansive flower centerpieces for your wedding tables. To bring a little contrast, choose smaller, more organically shaped arrangements for the night before. We adore this blend of cosmos, mums and ranunculus, which looks a little more elevated than wildflowers would, but still not too fussy.

### 15\. Wood-Fired Pizza Dinner

![Wood-Fired Pizza Dinner](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/35975649-27dd-44f1-a362-a9dacb2ff78f~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.768.576)

_Photo: Mary Costa Photography_

A wood-fired pizza dinner is a popular food choice for chill rehearsal dinners (and one of our favorite options for [rehearsal dinner ideas on a budget](https://www.theknot.com/content/affordable-rehearsal-dinner-ideas)), and it's not hard to see why. Remember to have gluten-free, vegetarian and vegan options for your guests so everyone can have a slice. Plus, the pizza oven low key adds a cool ambiance.

### 16\. Vintage Car Photo Prop

![Vintage Car Photo Prop](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/1e0db04d-1dba-4d15-a93e-9bd399811321~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.768.1024)

_[Photo: Logan Cole Photography](https://www.logancoleweddings.com/)_

You don't have to save the photo booth moments for your wedding. Consider doing something in the same vein as this happy couple, who parked a white vintage car at their rehearsal dinner for their guests to take pictures in. Bonus points if it's also your getaway car for the wedding the next day.

### 17\. Rehearsal Dinner Gift Exchange

![Rehearsal Dinner Gift Exchange](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/ddc5117c-e405-44b0-9b8e-b7ddc49abfb6~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.767.1023)

_Photo: Abby Jiu Photography_

Share a sweet moment with your loved ones during the rehearsal dinner. It's the perfect time to exchange gifts with your wedding VIPs, like the wedding party and close family members. You can plop down gifts at their seats at the table or hand them out before everyone departs. Consider pairing your presents with handwritten notes. 

### 18\. Personalized Cocktail Napkins 

![Modern Arch Cocktail Napkins](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/7bc96a4a-d67d-4df3-aaf6-9c2a0005db00~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1200.1200)

_Photo: The Knot_

A cute way to customize your rehearsal dinner: personalized cocktail napkins. Place them in a stack by your bar area (if it's a self-serve situation) or drop one beside each guest's plate so they can be admired. Cue the "aww"s when everyone reads your chosen couple fun facts. By the way, the text on these is entirely editable. 

[See This Design](https://www.theknot.com/paper/product/modern-arch-cocktail-napkins?v=aab7b4d4-e5f7-4f54-aff1-ea164511cd58&q=50)

### 19\. Simple Restaurant Venue

_Photo: Ryan Greenleaf Photography_

Your rehearsal dinner can be as low-key as you want. This couple chose a favorite restaurant they loved as the [rehearsal dinner venue](https://www.theknot.com/content/booking-your-rehearsal-dinner-venue) to host their event. And truly, you can never go wrong with this route, since you know the food and the vibes will be top notch. 

### 20\. Minimalist White Centerpieces

![Minimalist White Centerpieces](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/860f2f60-5c63-4da6-9123-165310054fbe~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.729.972)

_Photo: Megan Noll Photography_

One of our most simple and elegant rehearsal dinner suggestions, these wispy, white wildflower centerpieces will pair well with most any rehearsal dinner theme. Have your florist cluster blooms into modern bud vases of varying heights and display them in groups. 

### 21\. Potted Plant Centerpieces

![Potted Plant Centerpieces](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/6960dc1b-fa9b-4fb6-9cfc-38ab0c29b2fe~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1458.1944)

_[Photo: Ruét Photo](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/ruet-photo-georgetown-tx-768995)_

A funky flower alternative: cool potted plants. We love how this couple lined the center of their table with stripey ribbon grass, which works with the funky patterned tablecloth in such an interesting way. Plus, you can easily give them out to your guests at the end of the evening as favors. 

### 22\. Horseshoe Toss Game

![Horseshoe Toss Game](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/2c1219ee-f125-43ac-938b-0ce4f716fdda~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.729.972)

_Photo: Kelly Hornberger Photography_

Get your guests mingling and active by having fun lawn games at your event. At this outdoor function, they had horseshoes for people to play with––perfect for the couple's Western theme. Plus, since horseshoes are lucky, it might give you some good energy ahead of your nuptials. 

### 23\. Moss and Tree Stump Centerpieces

![Moss and Tree Stump Centerpieces](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/4bf3c319-1d61-4cf1-b13e-88477736c86a~rs_768.h-cr_0.121.1458.2065)

_[Photo: Bethany & Dan Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/bethany-and-dan-photography-portland-me-410767)_

We love unique rehearsal dinner ideas that make the celebration feel experiential and immersive, like these creative centerpieces. The design alternates between colorful taper candles perched on tree stumps and moss-grounded florals that are reminiscent of Japanese kokedamas—it's the perfect precursor to a woodland wedding. 

### 24\. Doodle Rehearsal Dinner Invitations

![Hand Drawn Cake Rehearsal Dinner Invitations](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/63057d96-c7f0-4902-9bbb-653514fe1c82~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1200.1200)

_Photo: The Knot_

These chic rehearsal dinner invitations simultaneously feel timeless and plucked from the latest trendy Pinterest board. Clear sans-serif text spells out your RD details, while doodle-like elements add a wink of whimsy. They come in eight different colorways, but the Red Clay is a vibe we're really loving. 

[See This Design](https://www.theknot.com/paper/product/hand-drawn-cake-rehearsal-dinner-invitations?v=817252f5-156d-4779-ad47-886a4d54fb62&q=100)

### 25\. Communal Farm Table

![Communal Farm Table](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/2402c0a6-bd5c-405c-b478-b4cb2bb00bd1~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.768.1024)

_[Photo: Caroline Logan Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/caroline-logan-photography-lancaster-pa-598798)_

At this rustic outdoor rehearsal dinner, all guests dined around one long farm table. Enjoying a meal like this creates a cozy, intimate feel everyone will love. It'll also provide a chance to slow down and catch up with your nearest and dearest ahead of your ceremony. 

### 26\. Seafood Boil Meal

Rehearsal dinners don't have to be formal affairs. This couple settled on a fun seafood boil for their coastal rehearsal dinner. You could even host a BBQ bash or enlist some of your favorite [food trucks](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-food-trucks) if you're looking for other casual ideas to kick off the wedding weekend in style.

### 27\. Casual Taco Bar

_Photo: Kelly Hornberger Photography,__Florist: Flower & Vine_

At this Aspen, Colorado rehearsal dinner, the wood tables, chairs and string lights bring the [Western vibe](https://www.theknot.com/content/western-wedding-ideas) to the event. The pastel blue table runner, goblets and mini flower arrangements are simple additions that make the affair look effortlessly elevated.

### 29\. Pop-Up "Diner"

![Pop-Up "Diner"](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/09e283c6-0dd1-492d-a031-35d1e86ac040~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.768.576)

_Photo: Logan Cole Photography_

The soon-to-be weds wanted to honor their grandmothers, so they added vintage rehearsal dinner decorations throughout. Retro vinyl banquettes and a backdrop with black and white photos of relatives from the 1900s to the present day made up the seating area.

### 30\. Alternate Space at Your Venue

![Alternate Space at Your Venue](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/67aceab5-dd46-4e77-b4ef-b4fcd50b847b~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.768.1024)

_Photo: Kelly Hornberger Photography_

This couple's wedding venue had a beautiful barn, but they wanted a summer wedding reception in a tent and weren't planning to use it on the wedding day. Instead of letting it go to waste during the wedding weekend, the couple used the barn for their rehearsal dinner. Ask your venue what other, smaller spaces they have available for your rehearsal dinner—you could end up somewhere cool like a wine cellar.
