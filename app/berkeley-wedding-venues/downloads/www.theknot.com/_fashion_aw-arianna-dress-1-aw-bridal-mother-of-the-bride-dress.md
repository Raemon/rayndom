Description

AW Arianna is glamourous and infused with the graceful elegance of a fulfilled mother. Designed from top-grade glitter mesh fabric, this is a fully-laced, floor-length dress with a mermaid silhouette. Its bedazzling diva's impressions include floral embroidery with sequins, thigh-high slit, and butterfly sleeves. With a back zipper for easy wearability, its bodice is beautified by a bateau neckline and built-in bra.
