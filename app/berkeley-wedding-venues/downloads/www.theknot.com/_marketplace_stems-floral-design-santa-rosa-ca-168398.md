When we were planning our elopement to California from Maine, obviously going to the shop wasn't really an option. I didn't even really know what I wanted. I sent Stems an email th...

rough their website and connected with Judy. All she had to go on was a couple of pinterest photos and my request for native California flowers, and the bouquet I received was better than I could have imagined! It was just gorgeous. Thank you!

Working with Stems/ Vanda floral Design was such a great experience. They were so helpful, setting up the centerpieces for us, and renting out lanterns so we could have the centerp...

ieces we wanted. The flowers for our ceremony were absolutely beautiful -the bridal bouquet was GORGEOUS, I cried when I saw it. I was planning a Sonoma County wedding from Indiana, so they were very responsive and easy to work with via email. They even provided a few clippings from the bouquets for our photographers to use in photographing details. Thank you to Bryce for all of his help!

The flowers at our wedding were more beautiful then I could have imagined. Barbara took my ideas and made them into beautiful pieces of art. I was blown away when she handed me m...

y bouquet, it was stunning. I feel as though I had given her a vague explanation of what I was looking for, and she hit the nail on the head. She even suggested using the flower arch for the ceremony and putting it at the head table during the reception, which made a perfect accent. I really believe that these flowers made our wedding that much more elegant. I highly recommend Stem Floral Design for any occasion.

Decent flowers, but not what I asked for at all.

I hate giving bad reviews, but honestly I wouldn't recommend going with this florist. I am an opinionated bride (aren't we all). I walked into stems with a plan for exactly what...

I wanted. I supplied photos, fabric and ribbon swatches to ensure I got what I wanted. However as I shared my plan with Barbara (the owner), she disagreed with me and wanted to give me her thoughts on what she thought would look best (roses that contrast with the dresses rather than blend) and spent half her time trying to sell me on other products she thought I needed for the day. Some of her ideas for other products sounded nice, and I agreed to think about it. So she drew up another quote (including the extras) for us to sign, saying we could always take off the extras later if we wanted. However I'm glad I read though the fine print because it said once the quote was signed, we could not decrease our order. I would not have been able to take them off. So I asked her to remove the extras so we could sign the quote for just what we wanted. I chose Stems based on price, and I'm kind of sad I did. And they weren't even that cheap! I thought I'd be okay if I was very specific in explaining what I wanted. I left a fabric swatch of the bridesmaid's dresses for color matching the flowers and I clearly said I want a pink rose to match that. I even supplied a photo of another bride who had flowers that blended with the dresses. However, the flowers delivered were hot pink roses (bridesmaids worse dusty pink dresses). They were pink, but not at all what I asked for!!! The quality of the flowers was good, but the service and end result was poor. If you choose this vendor, I would say make sure you agree with what Barbara wants to do, because in the end, it will be what she wants, not what you want :-(

My now husband and I live in Ohio, but got married in Santa Rosa where all of our family was. We both met Barbara ONCE, the December before our July wedding, to explain our desire...

s, color scheme, theme, etc. She GOT and REMEMBERED IT ALL!!! The flowers were purely beautiful and I wouldn't have changed a thing with the centerpieces if I would have done them myself. We had a "rustic" theme and she also went above and beyond to get a specific wooden box for the centerpieces. I would recommend Stems to anyone. Very professional, open communication, trustworthy, and talented.
