Vittorio 

Owner

More than a decade after first arriving in San Francisco to work at his uncle’s landmark Mill Valley restaurant, Piazza D’Angelo, Vittorio is back in the West Portal neighborhood that first welcomed him—a place where he knew he would one day return to open his own place. Vittorio, like so many other bambinis, picked up on the nuances of life in the kitchen, next to his mother. Now Vittorio's passion is to cater super fun Italian weddings at an affordable price to couples getting married in the bay area.

Best Caterer in San Francisco! If I had to re-do my wedding, I would have Trattoria Da Vittorio cater it again, without a second thought. Right from our very first email, Vittorio...

was responsive and friendly. Once we did a tasting and had some of the best Italian food in our lives, we booked him right there on the spot. He was always available to talk to us and responded quickly. Our wedding venue was not easy to deal with. Despite all of the intricacies and questions that we had, Vittorio was attentive and helped us along the way. All of the logistics for our wedding went well and we had zero major problems. Vittorio was able to take care of the rental equipment and did a fantastic job at very quickly setting up our ceremony and moving everything over to our reception later, and they cleaned everything up perfectly at the end of the night. We and all of the guests loved the food. We had bruschetta and meatballs as appetizers, 2 pasta dishes and 2 meat entrees. For dessert we had Tiramisu, Profiteroles, and cannoli tower. The cannoli tower is an add-on that I would highly recommend. The cannolis and the tiramisu were some of the best I ever had, which is a compliment I don’t make lightly. All-in all, you must choose this place to be your caterer!

Vittorio’s team was one of the most solid vendor teams we worked with for our wedding. Honestly, Vittorio himself felt like he was more than just a vendor we were working with. We ...

stayed in contact throughout the year before, and by the time the wedding rolled around, it felt like he was part of our whole wedding journey. We loved that we were working directly with a real and local person. From the initial tasting to the actual wedding day, his team’s professionalism, friendliness, and execution were top notch. His team was actually the only caterer we did a tasting with, since the food at the tasting was incredible, and the service was some of the best we had experienced at any restaurant. So it was a done deal for us, especially considering his very reasonable prices. At the wedding, we received countless compliments on the food and service, and we only left with one tray of leftovers since everyone had gone up for seconds (and thirds!). I don’t think you can find a better value, better team, or better food than Vittorio’s team can serve. We’re so lucky that we can go back to his restaurant anytime we want whenever we’re feeling nostalgic about our wedding day. (Go to his restaurant! It’s honestly some of the best Italian in the city. The eggplant parm is fabulous, and I usually don’t like eggplant.)

I was so impressed by Vittorio and his team. They went above and beyond to make our day special and to help me achieve my vision. We started with a variety of passed Italian canapé...

s, including bruschettas, caprese skewers, meatballs, and prosciutto and melon. His team then served a family style dinner to 130 guests with Caesar salad, pesto rigatoni, fiochetti, short rib, and chicken piccata, also ensuring our vegan/vegetarian/dairy free/gluten free guests were served at the same time with what I heard was a delicious dish. I didn't get to eat any dessert but one of my friends told me she ate her weight in cream puffs. Our guests could not stop raving about the food and have asked us where Vittorio's restaurant is so they can go back! Vittorio also brought in bartenders who absolutely crushed it with my bartender husband's very specific drink recipes. We feel SO lucky to have found Vittorio. He and his team were so on top of it and the food, drinks, and service were amazing. We felt so taken care of by him and his team, and I can't wait to visit his restaurant for our anniversary for years to come.

This July, we had our wedding at the Presidio Yacht Club / Travis Marina Bar in Sausalito, and working with Vittorio was one of the best choices we made throughout the entire plann...

ing process. After speaking with a handful of other caterers, we were getting stressed. Each of them required us to handle tons of logistics—renting plates, silverware, wine glasses, water glasses, hiring a bartender, etc. It felt like we were being handed a second job and there was no way we would be able to handle it all on the day of the wedding. Vittorio was the first person who came in and covered it all for an extremely reasonably price. He handled every detail seamlessly, and allowed us to actually relax and enjoy our wedding knowing that everything was under control. The food itself was incredible. We had a buffet—pastas, chicken piccata, mashed potato, braised beef, bread, salads—and our guests couldn’t stop talking about how good everything was. Vittorio handled dietary restrictions really seriously. We had guests with serious gluten allergies, including celiac. He even adjusted his braised beef preparation method specifically to avoid any risk of cross-contamination. Vittorio brought not only great food, but also professionalism, care, and calm. We’re so grateful we found him, and we’d recommend him without hesitation to anyone planning a wedding or event in the Bay Area.

If you’re looking to book a caterer, look no further. Vittorio is the man for the job. Not only does he provide the most delicious family recipe genuine Italian food, he provides a...

wrap around full service catering experience all at an unheard of affordable price. Our venue was very DIY only with tables and chairs - so Vittorio’s team brought in and set up all the linens, plate ware, silver ware, glasses, serving ware etc. for the cocktail reception and dinner needs. While we provided the alcohol, Vittorio’s bartending team was excellent making amazing mixed drinks and efficient service for our 180+ guests. Vittorio is professional, calm, and a gem of a person - he knows what he is doing and will not lead you astray in your planning. He was extremely responsive and always answered our questions in a timely manner making us feel at ease during the process. Now for the food - wow! We love eating at his restaurant Trattoria de Vittorio in SF, and the catering was no different - the food is great. The lasagna is mind blowing and all of our guests raved about the white stuffed pasta and short rib that was served. We loved having tiramisu in place of a wedding cake and our guests enjoyed Vittorio's personal service of the dessert and coffee to end the night. We recommend any bride and groom to use Vittorio and his team - or for any event! We will cherish the memory of the meal forever and look forward to celebrating our anniversaries to come at his restaurant.

Vittorio himself was a joy to work with: warm, accommodating, and incredibly generous throughout the entire process. He welcomed us into his amazing restaurant for a tasting that felt more like a celebratory dinner than a formal event (we’ll definitely be back), and went out of his way to accommodate our guests with dietary restrictions. He even surprised us by offering to make custom shirts in our wedding colors—such a fun and personal touch that truly went above and beyond. On top of all that, the pricing was very competitive and the entire experience felt more joyful and authentic than anything we saw from other caterers. We couldn’t recommend them more highly—thank you, Vittorio!

I asked and moved our car at the end of the night since we were unable to drive. The events coordinator at the venue was following him around, getting in his way, and just watching him all night. She did the same to me the day before the wedding so I knew she was going to make things harder. Vittorio handled her with grace, he was way nicer to her than I could ever have been. Vittorio is very organized and communicates well which took a lot of my stress away. I would highly recommend.

They served the appetizers for me and then served the buffet we had. The food was incredible. We did a menu of short ribs and chicken piccata, mashed potatoes, fresh veggies, salads and a wonderful homemade Fiocchetti pasta which was to die for! It made the event truly magical!!!!

s like family. When we visited his restaurant for a tasting, we were completely spoiled—he brought out so many options, and every single dish was absolutely delicious. It was clear how much care and pride he puts into his food. Trattoria Da Vittorio made the entire planning process incredibly easy and stress-free. He was responsive, organized, and thoughtful. He checked in ahead of the wedding to make sure we had everything we needed, but honestly, he already had every detail down. We never had to follow up or worry—he just handled it all. On the wedding day, the food was beyond amazing. We received so many compliments from our guests. The staff he brought with him were kind, respectful, and professional, and everything ran so smoothly. He also took care of all the extras—cups, plates, napkins, and even the tablecloths—which were such a relief not to have to think about. Everything was clean, high-quality, and perfectly coordinated. Trattoria Da Vittorio went above and beyond, and we felt so well taken care of throughout the entire experience. If you’re looking for incredible Italian food and a vendor you can truly rely on, I highly recommend working with Trattoria Da Vittorio for your wedding or any special event. And if you’re local, make sure to stop by his restaurant—my husband and I plan to go back often. It’s become a place that will always remind us of one of the best days of our lives.

Trattoria da Vittorio provided the most delicious food and amazing catering service for our wedding! I have worked with Vittorio on an event before, and there really had been no q...

uestion as to who we would ask to cater our wedding in San Francisco. We met with Vittorio about six months before and did a full tasting. He comes to the table with excellent recommendations and he made it so easy for us to settle on a menu. On top of all of this, he provided servers, a bartender, linens, champagne glasses, and extraordinary service leading up to and on our special day. When the wedding day finally arrived, we did not have to worry about a thing because he - alongside his amazing staff - took care of everything. They are the complete package and the next time I need to host an event, they will be the first caterer that I call. I need to rave about the food as well. We had three different passed appetizers (bruschette, meatballs, caprese skewers), four mains for the buffet (short ribs, lasagne, chicken piccata, fiochette pasta), caesar salad, mixed vegetables, bread, and for dessert tiramisu and profiterols. Talk about an amazing spread! Our guests were blown away and raved about how delicious everything was. San Francisco locals now plan to visit the restaurant! Again, I cannot recommend Trattoria da Vittorio enough. Outstanding food and incredible service. Not to mention kind and friendly owners and servers. We will be customers for life.

ions. From the moment we started planning, they made the entire process so easy and stress-free. What stood out the most was how attentive they were to our guests’ dietary needs—nothing was too much trouble, and they went above and beyond to ensure everyone had delicious options to enjoy. The food was nothing short of amazing. Our guests still can't stop talking about the tender short ribs, the flavorful chicken piccata, the rich and comforting lasagna, and the fiocchetti, which was simply out of this world. Every bite was incredible, and it made the dining experience unforgettable. The entire meal was an absolute hit with everyone! On the day of the wedding, their team seamlessly handled everything. They executed a flawless transition between the ceremony and reception setups while simultaneously making sure the passed appetizers were flowing during cocktail hour. Their professionalism, combined with the incredible quality of food, made them a standout vendor (who became more like family). And on top of all of that, their pricing was beyond reasonable for the level of service they provided. We feel so fortunate to have had Vittorio and the Trattoria da Vittorio team be a part of our special day and highly recommend them to anyone looking for outstanding food and exceptional service. We will certainly be using them again in the future, and visiting the restaurant many more times with our friends and family!

Trattoria da Vittorio is my MIL’s favorite Italian restaurant in SF and when the time came to choose catering for our wedding, she insisted on Vittorio and I am so glad she did! ...

Vittorio was truly amazing from start to finish. First he did a huge tasting for us at his restaurant and helped us choose the wedding menu. Then he met us at the rental place and helped us pick linens, napkins, silverware, glassware - basically everything that would go on the tables, and calculated the prices for different options right on the spot, so we always knew what the total amount would be in the end. He would always respond to my emails and texts within minutes, so we never had any communication issues. He also communicated with my wedding planner and the venue coordinator the last few weeks before the wedding and they never had any issues either. On the day of the wedding Vittorio and his team were brilliant. They arrived on time, set up the tables, set up the buffet, promptly switched to dessert and coffee and then cleaned up right after. The food was out of this world - I don’t even know how many compliments I got on the dinner! Many of our friends repeatedly said ‘the food at the wedding traditionally isn’t the greatest, but this was sooo delicious!’ and it really was. Everything was cooked to perfection and served on time. I think my personal favorite was the fiocchetti pasta and salmon, and my husband loved the braised short ribs. It was great having vegetarian options in the mix too. And their desserts are just the best - tiramisu and profiteroles were a huge hit with everyone! If you’re still deciding on catering and want your reception to be stress-free, at least from the catering perspective - I can’t recommend Vittorio enough. He really cares and will do his best to make your reception unforgettable and will help you as much as he possibly can for everything to go smoothly. Vittorio, if you’re reading this - thank you again, you are truly incredible, and both Nick and I are so so grateful for everything you’ve done for us!

well as choosing what entrees and desserts we wanted served. My fiancé and I stopped in at his restaurant and he gave us an amazing tasting of a wide variety of dishes to help us decide. Everything was so good, the staff were super friendly, and the restaurant has great vibes. Service at the wedding reception was also top-notch - again Vittorio was super helpful with setup and his staff were very attentive and friendly throughout the whole event. The food was also just as good as at the restaurant, which is particularly impressive considering they made enough for 100 people. Everyone raved about the food and were excited to take home leftovers. One guest even texted me a week later saying they had a dream about the food it was so good. Bonus, Vittorio made enough food for all of our other vendors free of charge. Overall highly recommend both the restaurant as well as catering service!

His staff is top notch and super friendly and nice. They manned the bars, served food, and ran back of the house prep. They also served meals to our other vendors. Overall, we loved working with them and know we will come back and visit the restaurant many times!! Thank you to Vittorio and his team for making our backyard wedding amazing !!!!!

t to taste test the food that was mediocre and unimpressive. I was at my wits end with finding a good caterer until my now husband started to expand our search for caterer into SF area and Trattoria da Vittorio popped up on our radar. I believe everything happens for a reason and THANK GOODNESS we found Vittorio because he is such an amazing person. Vittorio is fair on pricing with us, very kind, and beyond helpful to us during a stressful time. First off, we were offered a complimentary food tasting event at the restaurant and Vittorio was super generous with the offering. He served us so many different appetizers and entrees. Even insisted to pair his food with wine so that we get the full experience. The food was BEYOND delicious too. I don't think I've ever been to an Italian restaurant that hand makes ravioli and fiochetti as well as Vittorio and his team. I can really tell that Vittorio is passionate about Italian food and really cares about the quality. On the day of our wedding, Vittorio took care of everything and made my wedding a dream come true. He and his team even step up when our coordinators were lacking in their role. From helping with serving food, bussing tables to ending the night by cutting our cakes to serve to guests and cleaning up the tables... Vittorio amazes me with his customer service skill as well as compassion for us, the newly weds. It's been 5 days since our wedding and our family and friends still talk about how amazing the food at our wedding was! We served the ravioli, fiochetti, chicken in lemon capers sauce, and braised short ribs during the main course. The ravioli was made with black truffle and it was fragrant, tender, and just the right amount of creaminess. The fiochetti was firm yet soft, bursting with flavor of Italian cheese and pear. The chicken cooked in lemon capers sauce was not too sour nor tough. And the braised short ribs MELTED in our mouths. It was filled with flavor and I could tell was stewed and simmered for a very long time to give it such tenderness. To top it all off, Vittorio also made us a cannoli tower. I've gained 5 lbs alone eating the cannoli. It's the perfect ratio of filling to pastry. I can go on and on about Vittorio! We will definitely be recommending to all of our family and friends. As well as coming by to dine at the restaurant every year on our wedding anniversary or whenever we are in SF area :)

Every dish was beautifully arranged and served with a touch of elegance that elevated the entire evening. Our guests couldn’t stop raving about the food!

My wife and I had our wedding catered by Vittorio and his team last year. I had stumbled across Vittorio's restaurant on Yelp as we were looking for caterers, and the reviews were ...

hard to believe - people remembering the food for months? The best wedding food they'd ever had? Despite my skepticism, we did a tasting at Vittorio's restaurant. Sure enough, the food was amazing, and Vittorio himself was very kind and helpful. We decided to work with him, crossing our fingers that the food would be as good as our wedding venue as at the restaurant. Again, Vittorio delivered a masterpiece. He and his crew cooked everything just right, so that by the time it had traveled from his SF restaurant to our venue all the way in Marin, it was all the right consistency. The salmon was still flaky, not overcooked; the brisket was flavorful; and yes, we still hear to this day about how amazing the pear gorgonzola pasta was. Food aside, working with Vittorio was a breeze. He was kind and responsive throughout and helped our day run smoothly, handling all the linen, silverware, etc rentals for us - and at an excellent price. I really could not recommend Vittorio's catering enough, and my wife and I will definitely be attending his restaurant for years to come!

His Italian menu is DELICIOUS and the value for money is simply unbeatable. Vittorio is very personable and was a true joy to work with. We had approximately 170 guests and the night went off seamlessly thanks to Vittorio’s expertise in handling all the logistics behind-the-scenes. Vittorio coordinated and brought in the catering staff, bartenders, and rentals that we needed. He was able to secure additional rentals we requested (e.g., heat lamps) and make sure all of the details were perfect (even the color of our napkins!). The team went above and beyond to cater to our guests allergies/dietary restrictions and make sure all could enjoy the delicious food. Guests came to us with raving reviews about the food and service (one commented specifically on how impressed they were with the organization of the catering team during the dinner service!) The process of working with Vittorio was smooth and saved us a lot of time, energy, and wedding stress. We would love to work with Trattoria da Vittorio again for a future event given our outstanding experience! We look forward to continuing to celebrate anniversaries and visit his restaurant in West Portal for years to come.

Vittorio's professionalism and knowledge of catering large events set us at ease; he knew exactly what we would need from start to finish, and he was more than happy to walk us through the details. Our venue did not provide much to accommodate food service for 120 guests, but Vittorio brought everything necessary to make food service and bartending go smoothly. The food was nothing short of amazing and delicious. Our guests are still raving about the pear fiocchetti, tiramisu, and everything else three weeks after the event. We also had several guests with unusual dietary restrictions, and Vittorio was able to accommodate all of them without issue. Even the food with modified, allergen-free recipes were exceptional. We had a relatively complicated bar setup with several cocktails, a mocktail, many different whiskeys, and not enough time on the day-of to properly explain everything to the bartenders. Despite this, Vittorio and his experienced team made the open bar an incredible success. He has an incredible eye for the small details. For example, we were busy with photos during the cocktail hour and we missed the appetizers, but he set two plates of apps on the head table for us to enjoy when we finished. Additionally, there were problems outside of Vittorio's scope, but he went above and beyond to help make sure the day went perfectly for us. We can't recommend Vittorio enough, both as a restaurant and an event caterer.

I was looking forward to sharing their food with my family and friends since most of them haven't visited the Bay Area before. As expected, it was a big hit with our guests. They kept telling us how good the food was afterwards, especially the homemade eggplant parmigiana. Vittorio and his team were such a pleasure to work with from start to finish. He invited us to a free tasting at his restaurant where we were able to try the different dishes and craft the perfect menu. He even offered to make adjustments to accommodate different dietary restrictions. Vittorio provided all the rentals we needed for the buffet, bar, champagne toast, coffee, and dessert setups, as well as the various linens for the tables. We provided our own drinks and he allowed us to drop them off at his restaurant a couple days early, which was a huge help. We could tell that his main goal was to make us happy and he went above and beyond to achieve that! Vittorio and his team provided excellent service throughout the reception. He arrived early to set up the room and courtyard to match our floor plan. His staff walked around with appetizers during cocktail hour, handed out champagne as guests took their seats, and served food during the buffet. They also tore everything down amazingly fast after the reception finished. They put away the tables and chairs, boxed up all the extra food and drinks, cleaned up the kitchen, swept and mopped the floors, and more in under an hour. We can't say enough good things about our experience with Vittorio and would HIGHLY recommend him to anyone looking for a caterer!

My husband and I had a fantastic experience with Vittorio and his team catering our wedding at the Hibernia Bank! Vittorio did a personal tasting with us and helped us figure out ...

a delicious menu without any red meat or pork. Leading up to the event, he promptly communicated updates as planning progressed. His team arrived to the event on time and took care of setting the tables and pouring water, and then helped rearrange the venue during cocktail hour in preparation for dinner. Throughout it all, they were friendly and accommodating as we made a few changes on the fly. Our family and friends loved the food and dessert, and the team helped clean up once the night was done. I only plan on having one wedding in my life, but I'm hopeful I'll have another big event where I can work with Vittorio again! For anyone looking to work with Vittorio or another caterer in the future, my one piece of advice: figure out if your venue will require a fire permit for Sterno burners and alert your caterer well ahead of time so they can work that out!
