uper helpful during the planning and booking process, making everything so easy for us. I specifically wanted a band with a horn section, and they went above and beyond by adding horns to songs that didn’t even originally have them.

onal. Everything from their website, to their planning and communications, to payment was super polished (which is hard to find with bands and vendors)! The day of the wedding, they showed up on time and set up the sound super quickly. The sound was spot on, which is also hard to do for a new setting. They played music seamlessly throughout the ceremony, cocktail hour, dinner, then the dance portion. We gave them pretty open ended instructions on what kind of music to play, and they nailed it. And the musicians were SOOOOOOO talented. Highlight was the saxophone and Leah’s singing- people were raving about it!! All in all, I would hire Lucky Devils Band again and again and they were amazing to work with.

Lucky Devils put together an amazing 8-piece band for our daughter's wedding. They absolutely crushed their three hours of dance music for the reception, with two fantastic singers...

(she nailed a Whitney Houston cover, no easy feat), guitarist was a shredding machine with great rhythmic chops, entire rhythm section was slick and tight, horns were amazing on both fills and solos. The dance floor was packed from wire to wire. They and also served up a dynamite 3-piece, one-hour jazz session during cocktails, and the solo guitarist for the ceremony was terrific. We also used them for our wedding photography and the guy was a real pro, kept things moving and light. Finally, flawless communication from contract signing to post=event. Highly recommend Lucky Devils (we've used them for two weddings now)!

red all our questions (including about personal touches) and gave us all the info we needed to make everything run smoothly on the day. He was incredibly quick to respond to emails, willing to hop on the phone to chat through our initial questions and our pre-event details, and provided us with a planning portal so we had clarity into every part of the experience. Their pricing is really transparent, with the ability to adjust as we narrowed down the details about our event. When it came to the day of, it was absolutely incredible. Jefferson, our MC, was the perfect mix of talent, comedy and kindness. He got people on the dance floor, came in to announce things at exactly the right moments in a way that never felt like he was interrupting, and made the entire experience feel so fun and seamless. The band was absolutely fabulous: friends & family are still raving about how good they were. They had wonderful soloists, the instrumentation was lively and fun, and at times it felt like being at a private concert just for us and our friends. We could not have asked for a better experience! Thank you Jerry, Jefferson, band members and Lucky Devils overall!

The booking process with their producer, Tom, was seamless and stress-free. Our guitarist, Jefferson, was outstanding—kind, professional, punctual, and incredibly talented. He played a fantastic mix of top 40 hits, keeping the intimate gathering lively all night. His use of a looper added depth to the performance, creating dynamic backup beats that really elevated the atmosphere. Whether you're looking for a solo musician or a full band, I highly recommend Lucky Devils Band. They exceeded expectations and made this special event even more memorable!

ning our wedding at a venue with sound ordinance limitations, but Eric was incredibly accommodating and creative throughout the process. He took the time to understand our vision and suggested a 3-piece acoustic band to help us work within those restrictions—what a fantastic choice! The performance was beyond anything we could have imagined. The Lucky Devils Band perfectly captured the vibe and tone we were hoping for, playing all of our favorite songs and truly setting the mood for the entire evening. The energy they brought to our wedding was unforgettable, and we had so many guests comment on how amazing the music was. It felt like the perfect blend of elegance and fun, and we couldn’t have asked for a better soundtrack to our celebration. If you’re a couple who loves live music, we wholeheartedly recommend The Lucky Devils Band. They are incredibly talented, professional, and made our night one we will always cherish. Thank you, Eric, and the entire band, for bringing your magic to our special day!

all night. The jazz band they provided for our cocktail hour set the perfect tone and made the experience so much more special. Overall, we had a fantastic experience with them. The only reason I’m giving four stars instead of five is because they played a song from our "do not play" list as the final song of the night, which wasn’t the ending I’d envisioned for our wedding. We had met to discuss this but night of I don't think they remembered. But aside from that, they truly made the evening unforgettable, and I’d recommend them to anyone looking for a talented, lively band!

We booked the Lucky Devils for our wedding in Reno, Nevada. We had previously heard the band perform at another wedding and were so blown away by the level of play that we knew we ...

had to have them for our wedding. The planning was easy to do. The Lucky Devils have an online portal to provide details about the event such as the schedule, location, song inspiration, and payment. It comes with instructions to guide you about the desired content. Then about a month out, there will be a zoom call to make sure all the details are set for the day. The wedding day was incredible. We started the event off with an hour of live cocktail music. They played some classic rock hits in a more jazz style without vocals. It was awesome. I had guests coming up to me saying how impressed they were and it was only the cocktail hour. The reception music consisted of 3 sets starting off with some soul and motown music, then progressing into more rock sing-alongs. They followed our musical tastes for a more rock heavy evening along with some more recent dance hits. It was everything we wanted and then some. We were blown away with the level of play and professionalism for the entire evening. Throughout the entire night I had people walking up to me telling me how amazing the band sounded. Not to mention the staff at the venue told us on several occasions how good the Lucky Devils were. I wouldn't hesitate to book the Luck Devils again!

ys for the ceremony) We went with Lucky Devils for our wedding, and they went above and beyond our expectations! I don't even know where to begin except by saying this was probably one of if not the best decision we made with our vendor selection. They truly specialized the music to our taste and made our dream recommendations come true. We'll probably never see the Spice Girls, but getting to hear it live with a band, and sing along was probably one of the highlights of the night. Also hearing footsteps in the dark/today was a good day during the reception, my heart was soaring. They kept our guests energized, on the dancefloor, and singing along! We literally had people telling us throughout the night and the days following our wedding how good the band was! Thank you to the band, and Adam for helping coordinate and take in all our requests! If you're debating on a band, go with Lucky Devils, you won't regret it!

the end of our wedding, Lucky Devils was professional, kind, talented, enthusiastic and so energetic! We had a 9-piece band, 3-piece jazz band for cocktail hour and a guitarist for the ceremony. Each and every artist was talented, timely, kind and added to the overall magic of the day. We got countless compliments about the band. They made the reception such a joyful time and the best dance party!

and he definitely delivered! Also, super cool of him -- we had a speech and someone mentioned "Dancing in the moonlight". Without our direction, Tom played that song following the speech. Genius! Just amazing, thinking on the fly and adjusting to the space/audience. Have recommended him out already verbally to friends, and will continue to do so!! Thanks Tom!

Our wedding day was elevated to extraordinary heights thanks to the incredible musical talents of The Lucky Devils and their outstanding producer, Kelyn. The versatility they broug...

ht to our celebration was nothing short of exceptional. We utilized a string trio for our ceremony, a jazz trio for cocktail hour, a dynamic 7-piece band for the reception, and a DJ for the afterparty. Kelyn orchestrated this symphony seamlessly, ensuring every moment was perfectly accompanied by the right notes and beats. The string trio set the tone for our ceremony with elegance, while the jazz trio added a sophisticated ambiance to our cocktail hour. The highlight, undoubtedly, was The Lucky Devils' 7-piece band during the reception. They not only played our chosen songs flawlessly but injected an infectious energy that had our guests flooding the dance floor. The level of musicianship and showmanship was beyond compare, creating an atmosphere that will forever be etched in our memories. Kelyn's role in curating this musical journey was invaluable. He not only understood our preferences but exceeded our expectations, capturing the essence of our vision with precision. The feedback from our guests has been overwhelmingly positive; everyone raved about the music, and the dance floor was packed throughout the night. If you're searching for a musical experience that transcends the ordinary, The Lucky Devils and Kelyn are the dream team. Their ability to turn a wedding into a musical masterpiece is unparalleled, and we are endlessly grateful for the joy they brought to our special day.

couple we love going to concerts, listening to music at home, and dancing. Therefore, we began our search for a band that would bring the house down and bring all the positive vibes. It didn't take long before we found Lucky Devils Band. We attended one of their free shows at a bar in San Francisco which gave us the opportunity to hear their versatility and talent. From the onset, Lucky Devils Band and Kelyn were professional, easy to work with, and eager to meet our requests. Our wedding was truly a success because of Lucky Devils Band, they were fantastic musicians, they connected with our guests on the dance floor, and they kept the party going! If you want incredible vocals, talented musicians, and fun live entertainment-you can't go wrong with Lucky Devils Band. Carly and Andy

We used a 7-piece band which included 2 singers and a sax, and we also had a jazz trio playing during cocktail hour. Note this band has a large roster of musicians, so we didn't actually recognize any of them from the live performance showcase we had seen a few months earlier. But the caliber of all the musicians is really good. The guests and the other vendors were raving about the band afterwards, I cannot recommend them enough!

process. Our online planning portal streamlined the process and allowed us to input everything from our wedding day timeline to our music preferences to our playlists. They offered services including ceremony DJ or band, cocktail hour musicians, MC service, lighting, and more. They didn't require a stage, but we also ordered a stage (approximately $850) because it literally and figuratively elevated their performance. Since our ceremony was in Reno and they were driving from the Bay Area, we had to pay for their accommodations, which added another $1000. Despite us sharing our playlist, the band members didn't have access to our Spotify playlist so the groom had to share it with them, but it wasn't a big deal. The most important part was that this band was phenomenal! The crowd was dancing the entire time, and I heard a few compliments that Lucky Devils Band was the best wedding band that they'd ever seen.

ed on how amazing the band was and how they'd never seen such a crowded dance floor at a wedding before. The Lucky Devils brought so much energy to our wedding and covered a range of genres including pop, classical, Motown, and latin that kept the music different and interesting. You can of course customize with them what you want them to play, but we just opted for everything! We hired the five person band for our outdoor wedding in Sonoma and the sound, music and quality of performance was beyond our wildest expectations. We had the perfect wedding in large part to the incredible musical experience of the Lucky Devils Band!

family and all of my friends, I LOVE to dance, so music/entertainment was most important to me. We hired Lucky Devils Band without ever seeing them in person. I found them on Instagram and my husband and I made our decision based off of Lucky Devils Band’s exceptional reviews; we knew that this was a gamble with arguably one of the most important aspects of our wedding. Our gamble paid off in spades! Kevin, the producer, was great and professional to work with. When our wedding planner reached out for a quote, Kevin responded quickly and provided all of the pertinent details. We booked the seven-piece band for our wedding reception and added ceremony and cocktail hour music as well as lighting upgrades. Kevin sent me a link to the event portal for our wedding, which made the planning process extremely easy. We did everything directly from the portal including making payments, providing event details/timeline and providing an inspo list of music. By the way, right after we booked Lucky Devils Band, I told my parents and they requested a demo pack so that they could listen to Lucky Devils Band and for the next 6 months, all they talked about was how much they love listening to the demo pack and how excited they were! Fast forward to our wedding day: Lucky Devils Band elevated our wedding from great to EPIC! They are the greatest band I’ve seen in my entire life, and we had guests coming up to us all night long saying the exact same thing. In fact, people are still raving about the music! Before our wedding day, I provided a very extensive song list of songs from all genres as inspo for the band (we also provided Lucky Devils Band with a ‘do not play list’). The band played the most perfect mix of music and captured the vibe perfectly; every single person at our wedding danced all night - even the guests who don’t normally like to dance! Lucky Devils Band was THAT good. The singers were phenomenal - they engaged with guests and the energy was just completely insane. I cannot recommend Lucky Devils Band enough.. they are our most favorite part of our wedding! If you want a big live band to make your wedding or event one that people will rave about for years to come, go with Lucky Devils Band!
