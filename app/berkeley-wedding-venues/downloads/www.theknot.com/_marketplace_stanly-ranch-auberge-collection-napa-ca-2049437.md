From the moment we stepped out of our vehicle at Stanly Ranch, we fell in love with the resort’s relaxed vibe and friendly staff. Not to mention how beautifully Stanly Ranch integr...

ates into Napa’s environment. We did our site visit with Veronica who was so welcoming and immediately put us at ease. Veronica was very responsive to our questions early on and was flexible with us when we decided to push back one month to increase our chances of avoiding any rain. Once we booked the venue for our intimate May wedding, we transitioned to Kauri who guided us through the official site up through the wedding, and she took incredibly good care of us during our wedding week. Kauri was very accommodating, helped us set up personal appointments during the wedding week, and made a couple of special requests happen for the seating for our cocktail hour (which normally wasn’t allowed), saving us the hassle of additional rentals. The passed bites, dinner, cake and beverages were all incredible - the food was delicious at the tasting and even better the day/night of. The Chef was very attentive to a food allergy and had already altered the menu at the tasting for us, and then further accommodated a few special requests from the groom. The service from the Stanly Ranch Banquets Team, Culinary Team, and Chef were phenomenal and we wanted for nothing on our wedding day. We highly recommend Stanly Ranch as a wedding venue for its incredible beauty, relaxed atmosphere, and exceptional service.

We got married at Stanly Ranch in May 2023 and WOW! We couldn't be more thrilled with the entire experience. From the breathtaking backdrop of Napa to the impeccable service of the...

ir staff -- it was modern, but classic elegance. Stanly Ranch is new so all the fixtures and grounds are perfect. Getting married here in May, we had vibrant flowers and had our ceremony surrounded by white roses in their garden (a dream!) The food was delicious too, our guests were raving about their meals. We worked with Theo and he was truly exceptional. The whole staff went above and beyond to ensure every detail was executed flawlessly. Highly recommend!
