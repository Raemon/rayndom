ng. I had always been intimidated by dancing and never felt confident remembering steps or moving gracefully, but Erin changed everything. She showed us that dance is so much more than steps and timing. It became an experience, a connection, and one of the most meaningful parts of our entire wedding journey. Each session felt both therapeutic and fun. Erin has a true gift for making choreography feel elegant, natural, and achievable. She breaks down movement in thoughtful, digestible ways while still bringing artistry, emotion, and intention into every step. Watching her create is mesmerizing. The way she listens, feels the music, and lets movement flow from her so effortlessly is something special. Erin’s presence is warm, calming, and encouraging. Our weekly lessons quickly became the highlight of our planning season. We brought her a song, and she returned a masterpiece that felt deeply personal and perfectly tailored to us. I can confidently say that our first dance became one of the most cherished moments of our wedding, something I never imagined myself saying before working with Erin. And to top it all off, our guests could not stop talking about how beautiful and special our dance was. To any couple considering dance lessons: work with Erin. It will be one of the best decisions you make. There is a reason every review sings her praises. She is a true artist and an extraordinary human. We are forever grateful for the confidence, joy, and memories she helped create.

Where do we even begin? Let’s start at the top: Erin is simply amazing. We truly could not imagine a more perfect person to prepare us for our first dance. Not only is Erin an incr...

edible dance instructor, but she is also a wonderful soul who brings a sense of calm to the often stressful wedding planning process. Our weekly dance lessons quickly became our favorite part of planning the wedding. Spending one to two hours each week dancing together brought my wife and me even closer. Erin created the most perfect, beautifully choreographed first dance for us, and it was an absolute showstopper at our wedding. What started as my biggest worry became the moment I looked forward to the most. I cannot recommend Erin and her amazing team highly enough. There is truly no better teacher—or person—to guide you through one of the most memorable parts of the wedding journey.

You helped him fall in love with dancing and now we have even more to look forward to. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts!

Working with Erin has been a dream. My wife and I had chosen a very niche song for our first dance and while it seemed a little out of the ordinary, Erin helped bring our vision to...

life. She taught us that learning the dance together would not only prepare us for our wedding day, but bring us closer as a couple. This was 100% accurate. Erin also made us feel like our dance was a collaboration between us and her. Instead of choreographing it all herself (although she’s more than capable), she asked if we had any ideas or concepts that we wanted to incorporate. My wife had a vision for two separate lifts and Erin was able to find moments in our song where we could make that a reality. We cannot emphasize enough how professional and enjoyable Erin made our experience. Our first dance was all the rave at our wedding!

ut it since my husband and I had little to no dance experience, but she made us feel so comfortable and confident - from teaching us basic ballroom steps to choreographing our very own personalized dance with a few dips and lifts. We had so much fun in every class and practicing in between. It was such a fun couple activity that brought us even closer. And now we have our very own choreographed dance that we can do every anniversary :) If you’re thinking about getting a choreographer or deciding between a few, we would without a doubt recommend Erin! And if I had known that she also choreographs Indian Sangeet dances, we would’ve worked with her on our sangeet dance too! Thank you Erin!!

She made learning feel effortless and enjoyable, and by the time our wedding day came, we felt confident and ready to wow our guests! If you’re getting married, we highly recommend booking Erin!

experience, while also catering to my spouse's stage fright. This was our favorite part of wedding prep and we really looked forward to each of our lessons. Erin is an incredibly talented teacher and choreographs with such ease. She really helped coach us to make us feel as confident as possible on our wedding day. We sought her out specifically because as a queer couple, we really liked that she had worked with others in the lgbt community and created a safe space. It’s invaluable to us that we have this choreography to reminisce about our wedding day - and still do our dance on occasion. Thank you Erin!!

t started as a slower/more traditional dance, but then change songs mid-way to something more fun/funky/upbeat. Erin was incredibly helpful, encouraging, upbeat and fun to work with from start to finish. At the beginning, we weren't sure what kind of dance we wanted, and Erin asked questions to get to know us, understand what we were generally going for, and then helped guide us in figuring out the approach to our dance. Throughout the process Erin would suggest trying various dance moves and then coach us through them, and through that process we created a very unique, custom dance that both of us were excited about. Erin also had practical suggestions for the wedding day itself, which were very helpful. Our dance on our wedding day went beautifully, and all of our family and friends loved it. The entire process was collaborative and fun, and we highly recommend working with Erin.

the dance. We wanted a dance that had wow factor with lifts and twists and we got everything we wanted and more. She helped give input when we were picking first dance songs as we had a few top choices and she gave us her opinion on dancing to each one. We loved that she tailors her dance choreographies to the couple she works with and is very organic with the process. She explained that much of her choreography is made up on the spot based on how she views the couples she works with. She was very clear with us from the beginning about communicating our skill level and comfort in learning the dance. Would highly recommend her lessons if in the SF bay area!! She's even expanding her business to reach more couples in the South Bay!

We had the absolute BEST time working with Erin on our dance. During our consultation we mentioned wanted to dance to two songs and finding it hard to pick one and Erin said: “why ...

not both?” and choreographed a beautiful routine for a mashup of two songs. The process itself was a highlight, I got to spend some quality time with my husband and get creative with our moves. I love how Erin collaborates and incorporates moves/ideas we have too. So many people told us the dance was incredible on our wedding day. They didn’t think two people who could barely dance would have a whole 3 minute choreographed routine but we surprised everyone. And all of that is thanks to the creativity, confidence and fun that Erin inspired in us that we were able to tap in to on our wedding day. Highly recommend working with Erin! Don’t think twice.

a great instructor, but she helped us translate our personalities into a dance. We had a blast learning together and practicing and always felt supported as we worked through the challenges of learning partner dance. I would recommend this to anyone. I'm so happy we did this. It truly is a memory that we will remember forever. Our friends told us that it was so "us," and we truly enjoyed the process of getting there. So much goes into a wedding, and it's absolutely worth making the dance something you work on together to make special. It's truly a cherished memory for us thanks to Erin!

Don't think. Just hire Erin to help you and your partner make the first dance one of the most singularly fun and special moments during your wedding. My husband and I purchased t...

he Wowza package with Erin which includes eight private dance lessons. Loved that she filmed us after each session and gave us pointers and homework on how to improve prior to our next class. I also really love how organized she is. We got a text message reminding us about class 24 hours before our next class. Super helpful since we both get busy. On to the actual dancing though, my husband and I learned so much about ourselves dancing with Erin and we learned dance moves we never thought ourselves capable of before -- neither of us have a background in dancing. Erin really worked with us to make a dance that was reflective of our personalities and the joy we wanted to express. Come wedding day, so many of our guests and family were in total awe of our dance and came up to tell us we had the best couple's entrance and first dance they'd ever seen. We are so glad we worked with Erin. This truly was a singular experience.

Erin is a fantastic dance teacher. She created a wonderful first dance for my wife and I based on our song and helped us learn it quickly and with joy! I never thought in a million...

years that I'd be happy to dance in front of a crowd and proud of the outcome; Erin got us there. My wife and I came to Erin for dance lessons about a month before our wedding. We had pretty much zero dance experience at this point and didn't know what to expect. Erin set us at ease by taking the time to ask thoughtful questions and getting to know us as a couple. She then provided us with some basic drills to get us up to speed quickly. Over the course of 5 lessons, Erin provided excellent feedback and worked with us to choreograph a routine that was fun for us, fun for the audience, and within our abilities. She records each session at the end so we can watch afterwards to help us fine-tuning our routine. Thanks to her instruction, we had a wonderful first dance that got a lot of compliments. Even better than a great first dance, Erin showed us how much fun dancing together can be. Thank you, Erin!

Our first dance is comprised of 3 songs, all of varying tempos, but Erin was able to create a cohesive dance that we were both comfortable with and impressed by! It was amazing to see how my fiance and I could do moves we never imagined to be doing, all because of Erin’s teachings 😊. I wish I could be a guest at our wedding, to see our dance! I highly, highly, highly recommend hiring Erin! The lessons are totally worth the cost, so please include them in your wedding budget. Do not skimp out on having a memorable first dance! Further, we had the most fun during our dance practices! They truly gave us a break from the chaos of planning, and really allowed us to be in the moment, which we thoroughly appreciated. Thank you, Erin, for everything ❤!!!

n. She helped create a fully customized first dance that my wife and I were not only comfortable performing, but was fully tailored to our ability as dancers (which also grew through Erin's super-valuable lessons). Throughout the entire experience, we were always excited and eager for our next session - it NEVER felt like a chore and always felt like one step closer to building the PERFECT dance that embodied who we are individually, and collectively as a couple. Erin is an absolute pro and it was so fun working with her. She listened to every random idea we threw at her and provided insight to help us decide how our dance would be set up (I.e. based on the difficulty of the move, the space we had to dance, location, guest view, etc). I'd eagerly work with Erin again for any future dance needs and would HIGHLY recommend Erin to any couples seeking dance lessons for their special day or any special occasion (or just to have fun!) We're so grateful we found Erin - our first dance was a top highlight of our wedding and we absolutely could not have done it without her. Her help was invaluable and I cannot sing her praises highly enough. <3

My wife and I can not overstate how grateful we are to Erin Parsley for helping us to put together the wedding dance of our dreams. We first contacted Erin with just 4 weeks until...

our wedding date, and miraculously, Erin squeezed us into her schedule right away. All we had to do was choose our 2 dance songs, and Erin handled the rest. My wife and I had no experience with the waltz, but after just 2 lessons with Erin, we felt confident with our steps. Erin has a gift not just for choreographing the dance steps themselves, but also for adding romantic introductions and finales to the dance that set the mood. As polished as our dance became, my wife and I felt like our dance was worthy of "Dancing with Stars". Not only did Erin choreograph a waltz routine for us, she also put together a salsa routine as well, with just 10 private lessons in all. Erin also gave us helpful advice about to how to perform our best, reminding us to smile and breath to remain composed and relaxed while enjoying the moment. The day of our wedding, our first dance was an absolute success. We received countless compliments on it. We cannot thank Erin enough. She's not only the best wedding dance instructor, but she's also a delightful person in general. We recommend her to anyone looking for a wedding dance instructor.

Everything about this experience was wonderful. My wife and I met Erin locally in SF (wedding in Tahoe), where we had scheduled a full day of learning & dancing. Rather than having...

the dance mapped out from the moment we arrived, she had us go through some movements, ask about what sorts of elements we were interested in, and the dance came together organically throughout the day. As we slowly got better, she incorporated videos to help us improve more, and sent us home with them to practice! A week after, but only a week before the ceremony, we met up again. We showed the progress we'd made (she provided videos with and without instruction so we could practice from home) and we made some final tweaks and adjustments. Moving beyond the experience and the dance itself (which was a hit!!!), Erin was a patient teacher and clearly was invested in getting to know us as a couple, not just teaching us a dance. She asked us how we met, what we loved about one another, what sort of connection we had with our venue site, etc. This added to the experience and made it not just hiring another vendor, but something to remember. Not to mention, we now know some dance fundamentals that we've already busted out again!!

Working with Erin of Steps to Love Wedding Dances was the best choice we could make. We wanted to create a unique first dance, mixing a blend of ballroom and funky/pop dance styles...

. Erin fully embraced our idea and ran with it - which is why our first dance ended up being so special! Erin was incredibly creative and offered a unique learning experience - she not only taught us the basics of ballroom dance, but curated all the choreography along with us to make us feel like an integral part of the process. From the start she clearly explained waltz basics, and helped us become comfortable with partner dancing (we felt like we were part of a professional dance class!). She took time to make sure we felt comfortable with the moves and answered our (often repeat) questions each week. For the funky/pop portion, she encouraged us to let loose and really out our creative sides - again, Erin made sure we were integrated in the choreography process and felt like we added our unique touches to it. We had such a blast working with her to put the whole thing together!! Most importantly, Erin brought out the inner dancer from within each of us; my husband, who had no prior dance experience, was nervous at first, but truly blossomed and unleashed his inner dancer, which was incredible to see and experience. Our journey with Erin to our first dance was so memorable because it was so fun and we created something together - for all those wondering whether to invest in their first dance, this is your sign to do so!! Erin is so professional, fun, and will make you realize what a great dancer you are. Our first dance is something we will never forget, and we will have this unique choreography as part of our relationship forever. We have Erin to thank for helping us create & learn it, and for making this such a memorable part of our big day - we are so grateful to have worked with her and cannot recommend Steps to Love Wedding Dances enough to all couples!!!

She is an amazing, observant, and thoughtful teacher! In a double session, we were able to learn some basic steps, entrance, a few moves, and a final pose. What we really stood out for me was how Erin recognized our skill level or lack of and created something we can remember and practice before our wedding. She even sent us a copy of the video as a reference. Thank you Erin for making our first dance an enjoyable and memorable experience!

More so, Erin made the learning process incredibly easy - she's a wonderful person who truly makes each dance custom to the couple, and ours couldn't have been better! Starting out, we were hesitant to dance, feeling a little awkward. Erin's easy going nature and jovial lessons turned [semi]formal dancing from something that we both dreaded into something we practiced for fun at home in the lead up to the wedding (and have continued to do on our own since!). Erin welcomes people of all abilities, and makes it easy to go from "I can't possibly dance - with all those people watching me? I'll be so bad!" into "I can't wait to dance, I feel so comfortable and prepared". Erin's classes were everything we could have asked for and her tutelage is second to none. She made our song really our song, with a beautiful dance that we will remember (and repeat) for the rest of our lives!
