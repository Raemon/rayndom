YES! YES! We want to nominate our wedding film video for the Oscar Award! That is how great our video is and we are so happy that we met this company. My friend recommend because s...

he was a bridesmaid in a wedding they edited a same day showcase for. They truly put tears in all of our eyes. I could not stop watching all their videos. They are so perfect! I love our video and one day our kids will get to see how fun our wedding was. BEST WEDDING FILM for 2013, ours!

Where to begin... I met Matty and Eugene about 4 months prior to my wedding. We weren't planning on having a wedding video, but my wife insisted that I check these guys work out. S...

ure enough, I was AMAZED at what these guys can do with their cameras and editing. Their videos felt more like a movie than a wedding video. Once we met the guys, it was pretty much a done deal. They are the most down to earth, helpful, and artistic individuals. They know their stuff and they're more than willing to walk you through the entire process and answer any questions you have. What I loved about them was that it didn't feel like we were just going through the motions. We actually felt like they cared about making the best film they could with our wedding. I would recommend these guys to anyone and everyone. Our photos turned out okay, but my wife and I can't stop watching our trailer. Thanks again, Marmalade boys! We still need to take you to that sushi place we were talking about!

Honestly, I don't know where to begin...We wanted the best team to capture our "big day", so we knew we had a search ahead of us. When we reached out to Eugene and Matt, they were ...

so understanding and honest. They had all the answers we were looking for and made us so comfortable, we knew then that we had found exactly what we were looking for. On the day of the wedding, not only did they make myself and the rest of the party feel extremely comfortable around the cameras, but they also helped a lot with the flow of the day (which was a huge relief!). When we received our video, it was simply beautiful. It captured the day and spirit of my husband and I perfectly. Save yourself the headache and reach out to them first! The Marmalade Sky team is truly amazing at what they do.

My fiance and I decided on adding a viedographer last miunute and it was one of the best decisions we made. We researched dozens of videographers and Marmalade had the best style ...

by far - they really understood what music to use to enhance moment. Matt and Eugene were AMAZING! They were super easy to work with, super organized and worked beautifully with our photographer; we could not have chosen better vendors. To top it off, exactly one month after our wedding date, they surprised us with our wedding trailer! They really blew us away with their work and did a phenomenal job in telling our wedding story!

My best friend used Marmalade Sky Films for her and her husband's wedding this past June. She told me it was hands down the best decision of her wedding, and I could not agree more...

. As her MOH, I can tell you that Matt and Eugene were extremely professional, courteous, and friendly. They worked well with the other photographers and were a blast to be around! Their excitement made my friend's big day that much better. The final trailer video turned out incredible! It arrived promptly, was beautifully done, and still brings tears to my eyes to watch. My friend could not be happier with it. I know, because she can't stop showing it off at every event we go to :) Thanks guys for doing such a wonderful job capturing my best friend's wedding. She and her husband now have a beautiful memory to treasure for a lifetime. And I get the title of best MOH ever for finding you!

The best way of summing up their work is WOW. From beginning to end, these men were true professionals. They showed up on time, taped us without being intrusive or in our faces. Th...

ey spent the day following both of us around separately and then met up with us for the ceremony and reception. Their work is truly amazing. We saw our trailer today and both of us teared up at the beauty of their work. They do not just videotape the day- they make a video that feels as magical as the day itself felt. Their angles, lighting and affects all come together to make a beautiful video that will be shared with everyone. Thank you guys! We can't wait to see the final product if the trailer looks this amazing! http://vimeo.com/24524940

We used Marmalade Sky Films for our videographers during our August 2013 wedding. They were fantastic, made me feel extremely comfortable (which is hard to do when you suddenly ha...

I cannot thank Matt and Eugene enough! My husband and I hired them to shoot our save the date video and we were so happy with the final cut that I suggested to my cousin that she h...

ire them for her wedding. They certainly did not disappoint! They made the bride and bridal party feel very comfortable and even cracked a few jokes! I'm so happy that they were able to film not only my save the date, but my cousins wedding. I know that she and her will be absolutely thrilled to see her trailer.

Matt & Eugene were phenomenal! Punctual and personable. They were very professional! I didn't even notice they were there--meaning I was able to focus on the five million other thi...

ngs going on during our wedding day. A couple weeks later, I was sent a link to our trailer and WOW! The full length video is just as amazing. I'm so thankful we decided to get a videographer (and booked these guys) because they definitely got a lot of shots that our photographer missed. Thank you both, and wish you all the success!

Matt and Eugene were the best videographers we could have chosen for our wedding. When we met Matt we knew they would be a great match for us. They have amazing taste in music ...

and their videos always turn out to be so elegant and classic. They were professional and comfortable to be around. They were friendly with the wedding party and got along well with our photographer. The weren't in the way and were very respectful of space and time during the "glamour" process. I absolutely LOVE our wedding video. It is so well done they didn't miss a thing! We couldn't be happier. :) :) :) I would DEFINITELY hire them. You would be making the best choice for your wedding day and you will be THRILLED with the results!

We loved the same day edit film that was put together for us and to be able to see it on our wedding day was amazing. We had an emotional and touching day that was super fun and me...

morable that we felt was captured and shown through the film. We can't wait to see our longer film as keepsake. The guys truly showed their blessed talents and eyes to capture a memorable story of our wedding day told through their film/video work. Team Marmalade is fun, friendly and super creative. We were very happy to have them with us on our special day. They have gotten extremely busy through the year. So contacting them via email or calling will take a little while for a response. Just give them amble time to communicate your questions/concerns. They'll get back to you asap. Overall, we had a wonderful experience and love being touched and re-watching our film over and over. :)
