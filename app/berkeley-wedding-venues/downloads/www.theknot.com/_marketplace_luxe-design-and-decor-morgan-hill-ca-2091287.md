Luxe Design & Decor is the exclusive floral and design partner for our venue, MOHI Ranch. Even though we didn’t seek them out, they were absolutely fantastic! Savannah was so easy ...

to work with, and was absolutely able to pinpoint exactly the floral and design elements that we wanted. Our initial meeting with her was great, and she was super easy to work with. She heard our vision and then truly made it come to life. One of my favorite moments from my wedding day was walking into the reception area and seeing my wedding vision come to life before me. Everything was perfect. 10/10, no notes. The flower arrangements were perfect, and even better than I could have ever imagined. And I especially loved that the initial estimated quote ended up being very in line with our final price! We did go back after and add some more flowers, which did make it more expensive, but we did not have to and everything still would have been beautiful. And while the flowers were perfect, so were all of the design elements. The photobooth was so fun! And we had 1000 paper cranes for decor as well that the Luxe team absolutely nailed. I left notes when I dropped them off and the final setup was literally perfect. We would absolutely recommend Savannah and Luxe for all of your flower and design needs!
