## What Are Good Stocking Stuffers for Your Wife?

Good stocking stuffers for your wife have one simple requirement: they should be small enough to fit into her stocking. (If the stocking will be hung over a fireplace, it's also best to avoid anything flammable.) Other than that, there's plenty of room, metaphorically speaking, to get creative with your choices. It's fun picking out thoughtful and unique gifts for her this Christmas. And yes, we mean plural. You'll want to choose a few great stocking stuffers for your wife to create an experience, and they don't all have to follow the same theme.

FEATURED VIDEO FROM THE KNOT

When brainstorming ideas for your wife's stocking stuffers, focus on gifts that reflect her interests and needs. For example, consider a restock of her favorite lip balm, cozy socks for curling up with a good book or a handy kitchen gadget. You could also opt for more special items like a piece of [jewelry for your wife](https://www.theknot.com/content/jewelry-gift-ideas-for-wife) or a [personalized love book](https://www.theknot.com/content/personalized-love-books)—small but meaningful gifts she'll appreciate.

One final factor to consider is the cost, as those price tags can add up when you're getting multiple things. Here, we've rounded up some of the best Christmas stocking stuffers for your wife that are under $15, $25 and $50 to help you budget.

Fridays are pizza night in your household, and no matter if it's takeout, frozen or homemade, every slice will taste even better with Brightland's Pizza Oil. Infused with bold, aromatic flavors like garlic, oregano and chili flakes, this premium olive oil is the perfect finishing touch for any pizza. Drizzle it over a fresh pie for an extra burst of flavor, or use it to add a zesty kick to pasta, roasted veggies or, my personal favorite, avocado toast. It's a simple way to elevate her favorite dishes and bring a little gourmet flair to every meal.

If your wife is a fashion icon, she likely has a purse for every outfit, which means her cards and IDs are constantly making the swap too. A sleek, small wallet that keeps her essentials organized will help her stay stress-free as she transitions between bags. With plenty of card slots, a secure ID window and Vera Bradley's signature quilted design, this wallet fits easily into any purse (and stocking), ensuring she's always organized without compromising on style.

### 60\. Something for When She Loses Her Keys (Again)

![Tile stocking stuffer for wife](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/f21996b7-63a7-43b4-b806-d4d63eb530a5~rs_768.h-cr_63.0.974.683)

_Photo: Tile_

This stocking stuffer idea combines technology and functionality. If she adds her Tile to her keys and then loses them, all she has to do is open the corresponding app on her phone and ring her device. _Or_ , if she loses her phone but has her keys, she can press the button on her Tile to force her phone to ring, even if it's on silent. BRB, immediately adding this to our cart.
