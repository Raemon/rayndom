These days, picking wedding colors can feel secondary (or even tertiary) to selecting a wedding aesthetic. Our modern brains think in terms of "I want an old money, Italian dinner party wedding" versus "I want a wedding with blues, yellows and pops of red." These 2026 wedding color trends, however, argue that giving a little time and attention to some shades of choice (and how best to use them) will bring cohesion to a celebration and, most importantly, turn an event into an _experience_.

## 1\. Pinky Pink

![2026 Wedding Color Trends - Pinky Pink](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/0456f319-e785-4505-8d31-de327f3c5d92~rs_768.h)

Blush pink is always a mainstay in romantic and traditional weddings, but the hue is seeing a revival as one of the coolest wedding colors in 2026. Couples are leaning into punchier, richer iterations of pink. Think: rose, fuchsia and raspberry. Pinky-purple plums are also showing up. 

And pink isn't just making a mark as a standalone color in terms of on-trend wedding colors for 2026. It's appearing in some pretty unique color combos as well. Pink and brown (aka: your favorite colorway from your middle school Juicy Couture tracksuit collection circa 2003) is particularly on the rise.

## 2\. Juicy Red

![2026 Wedding Color Trends - Juicy Red](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/f42e0e56-1ab7-4ed6-948c-dd5145a7ecc3~rs_768.h)

Red was stepping onto the scene in 2025 and shows no sign of slowing down in 2026. The bold color is also synonymous with passion, love and romance, making it a natural choice for weddings. In particular, a juicy, bright shade of red is making waves.

Not to mention: The hue is already one of the most [popular wedding colors](https://www.theknot.com/content/most-popular-wedding-colors) in many cultures—for example, at Chinese weddings, red symbolizes fertility, considered one of the [lucky wedding colors](https://www.theknot.com/content/lucky-wedding-colors) and is believed to ward off negative energy. And the "pop of red" theory in interior design (which dictates that adding a small touch of red will elevate your space's overall look) totally applies to the wedding world. (More on interior design's influence on wedding colors in 2026 below.) 

"This almost watermelon-poppy red works so well across multiple designs," says Emily Gaikowski, owner and creative director of [Hearthrob Events](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/heartthrob-weddings-and-events-los-angeles-ca-2026957) in Los Angeles. "It's fun and unexpected, and a welcome pivot. We're incorporating pops of red in vineyard, restaurant and backyard weddings." 

## 3\. Classic Green

No [wedding color mistakes](https://www.theknot.com/content/top-5-wedding-color-mistakes) here: You can never go wrong with green. According to the 2025 [The Knot Real Weddings Study](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-data-insights/real-weddings-study), green made it into the top two up-and-coming wedding colors (with 33% of couples incorporating light green into their celebrations and 27% opting for dark green). The color is evolving in 2026, with different shades coming to the forefront and being used in creative ways (think: pistachio as one of your [summer wedding colors](https://www.theknot.com/content/hot-summer-wedding-color-combos) or forest green as one of your [fall wedding colors](https://www.theknot.com/content/fall-wedding-colors)). 

### Find your kind of venue

From barns to ballrooms, discover reception venues that feel like you.

Kate Ford, owner, lead planner and designer at [Kate Ford Events](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/kate-ford-events-monterey-ca-971945) in Monterey, California, notes that she envisions seeing deeper shades of green getting paired with earthy neutrals as the "new black and white," so to speak. "I believe we'll be seeing deep colors like hunter or forest used in place of black, and beige or greige tones instead of whites and creams," the expert says. Gretchen Culver, founder of the Minneapolis-based [Rocket Science Events](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/rocket-science-weddings-and-events-minneapolis-mn-598145), mentions that hunter green and kelly green might replace paler shades like sage or moss. 

## 4\. All Manner of Brown

![All Manner of Brown](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/43fc3e80-4a3d-4376-bde1-de1821bbfcd7~rs_768.h-cr_0.122.1458.2066)

Tonal browns, like chocolate, latte beige and portobello mushroom are cozy alternatives to white and cream, and these new, trendy wedding colors can bring richness and depth to your color palette. For inspiration, turn to interior design concepts like Japandi style (a combination of Scandinavian and Japanese aesthetics). And while we've been saying "give brown its flowers" way before wedding color trends for 2026 entered the discourse, Culver notes that 2025's [Pantone color of the year](https://www.theknot.com/content/pantone-color-year) definitely plays a part in the earth tone's prevalence in 2026 and beyond. She says that "brown in the new black." 

"I think brown is criminally underutilized in event design," says John Campbell, owner of and principal planner at [John Campbell Events and Design](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/john-campbell-events-and-design-tampa-fl-1056934) in Tampa, Florida. "I'm not saying we need to go monochromatic with it (though, that's a great choice for a couple looking to do something unique), but browns can add so much warmth to a design."

Lea McGilloway, founder of [LM Event Coordination + Planning](https://www.lmeventcoordination.com/) in Savannah, says: "I see darker browns, rich chocolates and espressos emerging in 2026. They feel grounding and sophisticated, and couples are ready for something warmer and moodier."

## 5\. Fine Art-Inspired, Old-World Hues

![Formal, emerald invitation suite](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/3160188c-b726-4244-b815-82e067e9f880~rs_768.h-cr_0.13.1094.1472)

_[Photo: Dark Roux Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/dark-roux-photography-covington-la-376308)_

I could go on and on forever about how ecstatic I am that fine art influences from centuries past have entered the sphere of wedding design (and I do, in this [wedding decor trends](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-decor-trends) article). And with that, comes colors like plummy purples, jammy burgundies, warm-and-dark blues, cream tones with depth and other luxurious hues. This is one of the wedding color trends that has carried over from last year and keeps holding strong.

"Jewel tones and fine art inspired hues will dominate," says McGilloway. "They feel opulent but not overdone, and they tie into the growing appetite for weddings that feel both elevated and deeply personal."

"Old world charm is all the rage in luxury events," says Campbell. "Of course, Baroque and Renaissance art have influenced that region for hundreds of years, so I see a lot of old world influence in these designs. Even when couples are incorporating a lot of color, they tend to be a bit moodier and not ultra saturated. That's a big contrast from the punchy pinks and vibrant, tropical palettes we were seeing five years ago."

## 6\. An "All the Colors" Approach

![An All the Colors Approach for your wedding colors](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/b1372895-0336-4484-8a0a-8a765cad1568~rs_768.h-cr_0.122.1458.2066)

_[Photo: MaMa Photo](https://mamaphoto.it/)_

According to Culver, a personal approach is embedded into all 2026 wedding colors, whether that be bucking norms around what constitutes [winter wedding colors](https://www.theknot.com/content/winter-wedding-colors) or [spring wedding colors](https://www.theknot.com/content/spring-wedding-colors), or being super strict in sticking to one or two shades. Instead, soonlyweds are thinking less in terms of a set palette and more about their desired aesthetic, making colors secondary to the wedding's overall vibe.

"Couples are thinking: experience first versus color first—the colors are meant to augment and enhance the design, rather than be a driving force of the design," the expert elaborates. "Gone are the days of color matching all items in the decor and attire perfectly. Couples are thinking more in shades and hues instead of a specific pantone. Mismatched is in, matchy matchy is out. As a designer, I rarely have a design deck with less than five color swatches on it these days. My clients are looking for that level or nuance in their color palette."

Additionally, McGilloway notes that there's a subtle version of this approach proliferating as well: "I also see couples layering four to six colors together in unexpected ways. Almost like designing an art gallery rather than sticking to a palette," says the planner.

## 7\. Tones Pulled From Interior Design

![Tones pulled from interior design](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/6e7ee664-c1ee-49dd-ac7b-4c23d426fec0~rs_768.h-cr_0.261.1458.2205)

"Having a residential feel to your wedding has been all the rage the last few years, and it shows no signs of slowing down," says Culver. "Couples are using paint colors as inspiration for their linen colors." The colors in question: soft, natural hues that feel super earthy and just a little vintage. 

Pastels have always been in the rotation of trendy color palettes for weddings, and 2026 will see a similar subtlety in terms of saturation. But even moody earth tones are appearing as a quieter, refined version of their rich selves that evoke elegance. There's a certain complexity to these types of colors, and you can push that even further by ensuring they come in the form of rich textural elements, like luxe linens and natural materials—just as they would in luxurious homes. 

"Earthy browns paired with cream and sage may be influenced by the current 1970s revival in fashion and interior design," says McGilloway. "I'm noticing that a lot of couples are drawing inspiration from interiors rather than just traditional wedding inspiration, which I absolutely love. I think that's why we'll continue to see palettes that echo home décor trends: deep woods, muted metallics, and bold accents alongside fun nods to nostalgia."

## 8\. Monochrome and Minimal Palettes

![Monochrome and Minimal Palettes for your wedding colors](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/76410189-77e7-4b63-98f2-a7d88d5599aa~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1457.1093)

_[Photo: FOOLISHLY RUSHING IN](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/foolishly-rushing-in-anaheim-ca-1067578)_

Yes, a bouquet of different wedding colors is one way to add visual interest, but some 2026 wedding color palettes will lean much more streamlined. 

"I feel like we'll continue to see a lot of color blocking and color palettes with less colors (such as two to three colors) instead of large-variety palettes with five to seven colors," says Ford. That's not to say limiting your palette to just one or a few favorite shades is dull by any means—a monochrome wedding will still feel dimensional with lots of texture variation. McGilloway mentions that this color palette wedding trend for 2026 is ultra elegant, since a desing with depth can be built using just one single hue.

Campbell adds: "I'm noticing that, when it comes to palettes, couples are wanting subtlety, and monochromatic or limited palettes over expansive ones. Less saturated colors, a lot of neutrals and all white and ivory designs have been popping up a lot for me lately. Even when couples want to incorporate a palette with contrast and depth, the colors are coming from a small portion of the spectrum rather than the full range."

## 9\. Going for Bold

![bold wedding color ideas](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/710fb15c-09d5-40ae-ab89-61dec308f7d8~rs_768.h-cr_0.8.1458.1952)

_[Photo: Twah Dougherty Photography](https://twahdougherty.com/)_

"I think 2026 trendy wedding colors will swing toward bolder, richer tones with more drama," says McGilloway. "It's still intentional, just more expressive. I think brighter colors are going to have more of a moment. Couples are looking to make a statement and move away from the softer blushes and neutrals we've seen for so long."

Culver seconds this budding theme in wedding colors for 2026: "I'm seeing couples desiring bold color for their weddings. They're not shying away from vibrant reds, oranges, purplse and blues." She also notes that couples might also gravitate toward this wedding color trend for 2026. "Not all couples are subbing out all the soft colors for bold, rather they are mixing in one or two bold hues in a muted color palette," she says. "This provides interesting and eye-catching contrast."
