[READ MORE Want Bagpipes Played at Your Wedding? Find a Pro ](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/wedding-soloists-ensembles)

Once you've selected your bagpipe songs for your wedding (of which we provided several ideas below), you'll need to [hire bagpipe players](https://www.theknot.com/content/bagpiper-wedding) for your special day. Luckily, that is easy to do on [The Knot Vendor Marketplace](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/wedding-soloists-ensembles). Enter your marrying location and filter by "instruments" and "bagpipes" to find pipers in your area. 

To learn more about bagpipes for your wedding ceremony, we tapped professional bagpiper [Jason Faulkner](https://bagpiperjasonfaulkner.scot/), pipe major Julie Brinklow of [Thistle Piping](https://www.thistlepiping.com/about/julie), Marty McAndrew, band manager of [Shannon Rovers Irish Pipe Band](https://shannonrovers.com/), Craig McIntosh, [Royal Deeside Bagpiper](https://theyorkshirebagpiper.com/) and [Brian Caltabiano](https://www.instagram.com/brian_the_bagpiper/), New York City-based bagpiper.

[READ MORE Want Bagpipes Played at Your Wedding? Find a Pro ](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/wedding-soloists-ensembles)

## 1\. "Can't Help Falling in Love," Elvis Presley

When it comes to wedding songs on a bagpipe, McAndrew notes that Presley's "Can't Help Falling in Love" is one of the most popular. Since it is a slower tune, it's a solid choice for the first dance—just make sure to rehearse your dance ahead of time, as you might not be used to the rhythm when heard on the bagpipes.

## 2\. "Highland Cathedral," Ulrich Roever and Michael Korb 

Brinklow and Caltabiano note that "Highland Cathedral" is one of the best bagpipe songs for a wedding, and for a good reason. Not only is it many bagpipers' favorite wedding tune to play, but it is also a popular choice due to its versatility. "It can work at any part of a wedding ceremony and even for a bridal party entrance at the reception," Caltabiano adds. 

## 3\. "She Moved Through the Fair," Various Artists (Sinéad O'Connor)

As far as [Irish wedding songs](https://www.theknot.com/content/irish-wedding-songs) go, Caltabiano notes that "She Moved Through the Fair" is a popular [song to walk down the aisle to](https://www.theknot.com/content/songs-to-walk-down-aisle-to). Whether you're hosting your wedding in Ireland or simply looking to incorporate some Celtic flare into your big day, your guests will appreciate this historical and slower-paced ballad widely recognized from its modern-day recording by Sinéad O'Connor. 

## 4\. "La Boum," Bertrand Louet

Caltabiano notes that this medium-speed tune is perfect for an attention-grabbing ceremony entrance or exit. However, if you'd like it to serve as the tune played when walking down the aisle, request that your piper play it slower. 

## 5\. "What a Wonderful World," Louis Armstrong

When thinking about wedding songs on bagpipes, Louis Armstrong's version of "What a Wonderful World" is easily one of the most popular. "This tune could be used at any point of a wedding or even as a father-daughter or mother-son dance," Caltabiano adds.

## 13\. "Let it Go," Idina Menzel

Disney fans will appreciate this hit song from Disney's _Frozen._ Although you can ask your bagpipers to play this song anytime during your festivities, this climactic song is a great pick for your reception. 

## 14\. "Perfect," Ed Sheeran

It's hard to go wrong with Ed Sheeran's love song "Perfect" if you want to stir up some chills during your ceremony.

Regardless of the timeframe you schedule this tune, we know it will be _perfect_. 

## 15\. "Closer," The Chainsmokers

Although you (and your guests) may not expect this song from The Chainsmokers to be played with bagpipes, it's surprisingly very popular and can be considered one of your [wedding reception entrance songs](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-reception-entrance-songs).
