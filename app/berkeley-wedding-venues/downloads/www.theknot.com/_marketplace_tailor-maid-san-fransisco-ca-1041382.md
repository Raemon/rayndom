I had Tailor Maid tailor my wedding dress (at the recommendation of Lovely Bride, where I bought my dress). It was a complicated weird dress and they did a great job with it, inclu...

I cannot recommend Tina and Tailor Maid enough for wedding dress alterations! From the moment I met Tina, I knew I was in great hands. She is incredibly knowledgeable, professional...

, and made the entire process so smooth and stress-free. Tina's expertise in dress alterations is unmatched. She worked closely with me to ensure every detail was perfect, and the result was nothing short of amazing. My dress fit like a glove, and I felt absolutely beautiful on my wedding day. Not only is Tina a talented and skilled seamstress, but she is also such a joy to work with. She was always kind, patient, and attentive, making sure I was completely happy with every fitting. I can honestly say my dress wouldn’t have looked nearly as stunning without her. If you're looking for someone to handle your wedding dress alterations, I wholeheartedly recommend Tina and Tailor Maid. Their professionalism, attention to detail, and the quality of their work is second to none. Thank you, Tina, for making my dress fit perfectly and helping to make my wedding day so special!

I read multiple reviews of countless alterations companies before deciding to work with Tailor Maid. I even spoke with bridal boutiques to see who recommended for alterations. It w...

as clear that Tailor Maid had an impeccable reputation. When I reached out to them for a quote, I also sent videos and photographs of my dress. They responded with a short list of anticipated alterations and associated costs. In the final cost, there were no surprises- everything very closely reflected their anticipated quote. Their appointment scheduling process was easy and flexible. I have an incredibly Inflexible work schedule with sometimes unpredictable hours. They were willing to work with me in order to help me make fitting appointments. They had a great eye when it came to needed changes, suggestions and did their best to keep cost in mind (which I always appreciate!). They were able to make the alterations quickly so that I didn’t have a single stressor when it came to my dress. It looked absolutely gorgeous and fit like a glove when I made it to my wedding day!

Wedding tailoring of my dreams! I didn't think I could love my wedding dress anymore until I put it on after having it tailored by the team at Tailor Maid. It was like a different ...

dress in the best possible way. It fit me perfectly, allowing me to feel comfortable and move easily around. The team helped to fit the the bodice to my waist size, requiring delicate and intricate work that they executed flawlessly. In addition, they hemmed my dress length, added a bustle , and created a custom veil that matched the length of my dress. I couldn't have been happier with the outcome and would recommend Tailor Maid to anyone!

I can't say enough amazing things about this place. I bought a pre-loved dress from a consignment store in San Francisco and brought it here. Amazingly they recognized that they ha...

d hemmed the dress for the previous owner because they had saved the excess fabric with the dress and recognized their bustle loops! They crafted a beautiful belt from the leftover fabric. I had a minor shoe dilemma since after altering the dress, the hem was too short (this dress was pre-hemmed since it was owned before). They were actually able to stretch out the lace and make it the perfect length. I was shocked. They were nothing but kind, professional, and genuinely excited to be a part of my wedding journey. At my final fitting, I couldn't hold back tears because I was so amazed and so happy with how beautiful the dress turned out. They do such quality work, are transparent about pricing, and remove much of the stress that comes with wedding planning!

I loved working with the team at Tailor Maid!! They did a beautiful job on my dress and it turned out so exactly as I hoped! I really valued all of their expertise from how to get ...

my dress pressed as I was traveling out of town, what style of bustle would look best and other elements of the tailoring. I really appreciated all of their guidance and tips since it can sometimes be hard to figure out the right thing to do and I was so worried about making the wrong choice for my dress. I had a great experience overall as they made it really fun and I never felt overly rushed or anything. They also turned around the alterations in a very timey manner which was great, especially since I had to go back for a final tweak just before going out of town for my wedding. I would absolutely recommend working with Tailor Maid for your wedding dress!!

Tailor Maid worked WONDERS. Could not recommend them more. Yes, they’re pricy, but after spending that much on a wedding dress, there was no way I was going to risk it on the tailo...

ring! My dress was a GORGEOUS Sarah Seven and was also INCREDIBLY hard to alter up top! It has a peak sheer cutout on the side, deep V next in the center, and low back. Despite ordering it in a split size, it was still huge up top. The tailors at TM were able to take in my dress so that it literally fit like a glove AND added the cute little buttons. In addition, I also decided to buy a Sarah Seven dress to change into for the reception. I LOVED the Eloisa top, but wanted something a little short and cute for the party - similar to some of their minis. So, I got the Eloisa which is usually a midi and had them shorten it and CREATE THE SAME HEM (not easy) as the cute mini dresses Sarah Seven makes. OMG the tailoring was just so impressive and insane. I feel like I got two custom dresses. I am so excited because the reception dress I got is one I can wear over and over again!! Thank you!!

Tailor Maid was recommended to me by a colleague and I’m very glad I took her advice, even though I considered going to a less expensive tailor. My dress, which we assumed would be...

a simple alteration, yielded some unexpected challenges just a few weeks before the wedding—that’s when I was so glad to be working with a professional bridal tailor. The staff did extra work to fix the issues at no added cost and squeezed me in for an added fitting to make sure their solutions were going to work. In the end, my dress fit me beautifully. It was worth every penny! The staff is so kind and the space feels airy and upscale. I had a great experience and highly recommend Tailor Maid.

I am so grateful that Tailor Maid exists in San Francisco so that they could help me with alterations for my wedding dress! Marissa and her team were awesome. After being told by a...

nother tailor that it was too late to help me, I contacted Tailor Maid six weeks before my wedding. They assured me that they could take care of me, and they did! At my first appointment, I felt such a huge sense of relief because I was confident they could tailor my dress well and in time. My “dress” involved three different pieces, all of which needed alterations. My skirt had a huge slit that needed to be closed, and it also needed to have the waist taken in, the length shortened, and a bustle added. My two top pieces also both needed to be taken in. Marissa and her team did an amazing job with the alterations. I felt comfortable and confident throughout my experience there, which included four fittings. I would recommend Tailor Maid to anyone in need of dress alterations. Thank you, Marissa & team, for taking such good care of me and my dress!
