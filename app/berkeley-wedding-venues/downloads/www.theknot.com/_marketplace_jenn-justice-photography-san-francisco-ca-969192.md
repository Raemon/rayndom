Being a part of your wedding day is more than just capturing beautiful photos; it's about creating a relationship through trust and confidence. My goal is to capture you in your natural state, with the people you love the most with you and around, and your love as it is right now. Capturing love stories is something I simply cannot live without.

I take an editorial approach to photographing the details, building a story with my subjects from the engagement to the wedding day. My images will leave you with a feeling of joy, as if you were transported back to the moment I clicked the shutter. I am based in San Francisco and Dallas but travel where love goes to tell your story. Jenn Justice Photography is owned and operated by passionate photographer Jenn Gardner.

Jenn is AMAZING! Not only is her skill top notch so is her professionalism and friendliness. If you are someone who doesn't feel comfortable or "natural" in front of a camera. Don'...

t worry she creates a comfortable environment to overcome that. We hired Jenn to photograph our engagement and wedding photos in 2020 and 2021. My husband and I are still raving over the magic captured in each photo. We will be hiring her in the future for more photo opportunities because we LOVED working with her!

ands when we viewed our engagement photos. For the wedding, she met all our immediate family members the day before and made everyone feel comfortable being photographed. On the wedding day, she was efficient with our first look and family pictures while also capturing sweet candid moments throughout the day. We loved getting a huge sneak peek gallery just a few weeks after the wedding, and she delivered our entire wedding gallery in only 1.5 months, which was incredibly fast! Hiring Jenn was one of the best decisions we made for our wedding and we cannot stress what a sense of calm she added to the overall planning. We're so happy to have amazing pictures to look back on. Thanks Jenn!

s, and she made the entire process easy and stress-free. Jenn captured both our engagement and wedding photos beautifully, and we couldn’t be happier with the results! A few things that made her truly stand out: She has an incredible energy and calming presence, which helped us feel comfortable and natural in front of the camera. She arrives early to scout the best photo spots, ensuring stunning backdrops for every shot. Her posing guidance is on point—helpful, clear, and never awkward! When my makeup ran late, I was feeling frazzled, but Jenn took control of the situation with ease. She adjusted the timeline on the fly and still managed to capture every shot we had hoped for! We absolutely love our photos and highly recommend working with Jenn. She is talented, professional, and truly goes above and beyond to make your special day even more magical!

Jenn is truly amazing! My daughter had worked with her before and couldn't stop praising how wonderful she was, and after experiencing it myself with my husband, I completely agree...

. Our wedding day was outdoors in 104-degree heat, and despite the challenging weather, Jenn managed to capture stunning photos. What really stood out, though, was her incredible personality—she not only took gorgeous pictures but also had the perfect balance of professionalism and warmth. She effortlessly gathered everyone together, even while we were all trying to stay cool. Jenn's energy made the whole experience enjoyable, and we couldn't have asked for a better photographer!

our family backyard and then the reception close by. No surprise but we were behind schedule and Jenn was very flexible and a calming force. She made great use of time getting photos taken before the ceremony and capturing those fun candid moments. After the ceremony she arrived to the reception space and immediately dived in to couple shots so we could get them done before guests arrived. Both my husband and I are not very comfortable when a camera is pointed in our direction but Jenn helped us to relax so we could really enjoy the moment and capture the day. Our ceremony was just for immediate family but we knew guests would love to see a couple photos so Jenn put together a few that we could have for a slideshow at the reception. It was such a great surprise for the guests. Can't recommend Jenn more!

I am a mess of a person and wedding planning did not bring out the best of me. Luckily I had Jenn as my photographer. When I hired her I had no idea what to expect other than man...

ners. She responded to every email I sent within 12-48 hours. Then she arrived on our wedding day. . . I can't even begin to describe how perfect my wedding was because of her. She's not just a photographer you hire and never think about again. She's the type of person you talk about on your honeymoon and invite over for a beer. While she's a true professional she's the sweetest person I've ever known. I recommend her over all of my other vendors and the venue. If you are high strung and indecisive, please hire Jenn, you need a photographer who goes the extra mile for your wedding and does it as a friend.
