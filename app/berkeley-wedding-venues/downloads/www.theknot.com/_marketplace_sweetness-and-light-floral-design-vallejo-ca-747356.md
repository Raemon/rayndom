For my wedding, I wanted to support a flower business that cares about sustainability and local-sourcing. Sweetness & Light does, and they came with a strong recommendation from an...

acquaintance who was married at our venue (Gardens at Heather Farm). I had already looked up Sweetness & Light after seeing that they were preferred vendor at GHF, and liked the natural, garden vibes of their arrangements. After speaking with Wendi, the owner of Sweetness & Light on the phone, I felt confident in her knowledge of the venue and general expertise! That was back in 2019 and after two postponements due to the pandemic, I was finally able to have my wedding last month. Wendi was so kind and generous to honor our original quote from 2019 despite the rising prices of flowers these days. Our day-of coordinator was surprised to know this and said we found a truly nice and special florist. Going through the pandemic and having the wedding hang over us was quite stressful. We know that small businesses were greatly affected as well, so we're especially touched by how thoughtful and compassionate Wendi is. When we first spoke, I had told Wendi our color palette that I want the arrangements to "look as if picked from the Gardens" to create a sense of continuity between the outdoor and indoor spaces. She did a wonderful job and many people commented on how gorgeous the bouquets and all the arrangements are. She certainly made our wedding look amazing. Wendi also dropped off some flowers at my hotel in the morning for detail shots. Thank you so, so much, Sweetness & Light!! P.S. I asked a local flower-recycling organization, Blossom Buddies, to coordinate with Wendi to pick up the arrangements after the wedding. They did, and volunteers at Blossom buddies repurposed the flowers and delivered them to assisted living facilities. My husband and I are so grateful and glad that flowers made more people happy after the wedding.

ith our color scheme, theme, and weather, and we received so many compliments on them. The pomegranates and blackberries were a beautiful touch. We asked our guests to take home the arrangements, and every single one was gone immediately. We highly recommend Sweetness and Light!

OH MY GOODNESS! Stop searching for a florist for your event because you have found the nicest and most awesome florist there is, her name is Wendi and she is the owner of the shop!...

I was recommended to hire her for our wedding that was supposed to happen in the fall of 2020 but we all know how that played out. When it came to changes she was more than willing and accommodating. I follow her instagram account @sweetnessandlightflowers , I highly recommend taking a look at her beautiful creations! When it came to discussing designs and a floral plans she listened to me and my ideas. However after following her instagram account I wanted to give her most of the design freedom but still maintaining the overall image we had for our special day. The day of let me tell you! SHE WENT ABOVE & BEYOND MY FLORAL DREAMS COULD EVER IMAGINE! I was the bride so unfortunately I did not have my phone on me to take a picture of her creations but once I get one I will happily update :) I wish I lived closer to the Benicia area just to stop by her lovely shop! I could gush all day about how amazing Wendi is & her wonderful designs! Her entire team was so helpful in every way! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!

We hired Wendi a couple months before our micro wedding. I just handed her my pintrest for what I was thinking and O.M.G. did she deliver! She made my bridal bouquet and my archway...

pieces. The arch piece was absolutely perfect for the shape I picked. The flowers were even more beautiful than I imagined and if I could redo one thing it would have been to spend the extra money and have her do ALL our floral. Thank you so much Wendi, I can't wait to use your lovely business for my other floral needs in the future!!!!

e flowers. After I met with Wendi she put together a Pinterest board and it was exactly what I wanted! On the day of the wedding she exceeded my expectations with the flowers! Everything was beautiful, and I could not have asked for a better florist! Wendi was also super responsive and accommodating throughout the entire process. I would highly recommend Wendi for wedding or event flowers.

I recommend Wendi's floral services for your next event, be it a wedding or otherwise! My husband and I worked with Wendi for our mellow, DIY wedding in Walnut Creek. After we exp...

ressed our interest in the smallest package on her site and explained our floral decor needs, Wendi graciously trimmed down the cost of our package and floral purchases to match precisely what we were looking for. She was a delight to collaborate with as well. We met for coffee to share more about our wedding and our personalities -- Wendi used this information and interaction to craft beautiful floral arrangements that matched who WE were as a couple, in addition to the aesthetic of the event itself. I was so impressed! My and my bridal parties' bouquets also received so many compliments -- and they smelled amazing... In short, Wendi is wonderful to work with and her craftsmanship with flora is phenomenal -- if you are looking for a florist who will collaborate with you to create your vision, look no further than Sweetness & Light!

owing that she understood me and the vision I had for our big day. The presentation she gave for her proposal was amazing! I loved that with the proposal she included pictures of the general look that she would be putting together, for me being a visual person that was beyond helpful. The final 30 days before the wedding she was so helpful and even went above and beyond what I had expected. Her team dropped off flowers at multiple locations and even came back at the end of the reception to clean up/pick up any of their pieces left behind. She even went above and beyond by adding flower arrangements to our chairs we sat in during the reception and put floral arrangements in the bathrooms! She was one of the best decisions I made to help our dream come to life! Thank you Wendi!!

Sebastien Bicard is one of the most talented wedding photographers in the United States, if not the world. Once I looked at his Instagram profile, I knew that he was our guy. With ...

Sebastien it is not just wedding photography, it is art. He photos feel like they should be hanging in a gallery somewhere or gracing the pages of Vogue. He has such an innovative and incredible eye, and such a stellar personality to boot. He loves love and it shows. From the constant communication (everything from body image to the name of everyone involved) to checking in with us the day of about everything and anything, I knew that I could trust him with the most important day of our lives. Most weddings you have a few great photos, Sebastien gave us hundreds. I wept when I saw the pictures, they were so beautiful. All my friends on social media have commented, “Who was your photographer? These are amazing!” Every guest commented on how fun and talented Sebastien was, as he found the coolest corner for the most interesting shot, asking how did you find someone so phenomenal. We feel beyond blessed by the images and memories Sebastien has left us for the rest of our lives.

om start to finish. I knew right away when looking at photos from different florists in the area that Sweetness & Light would be the best fit for our wedding. You can tell that they really put care and attention into all their arrangements, they are very beautiful, unique, and well-crafted. They were responsive, very nice and easy to work with. You can tell Wendi is an expert with flowers, and I felt confident after our initial meeting that the final flowers would be amazing, which is big for me since I'm usually a worrier! Wendi was able to capture our vision perfectly and the floral arrangements at our wedding were beautiful. I highly recommend Sweetness & Light to anyone looking for a florist!

Holy guacamole, Wendi is incredible. She put up with our super nit picky requests about arches - we had no idea what we were looking for and she came up with the perfect solution. ...

She even talked us out of a couple of ideas that, in retrospect, were bonkers. The flowers she brought to the wedding were beautiful and fit our theme/colors perfectly. She absolutely rocked it and I'm so grateful that we were able to hire her for our big day. Thank you Wendi!

I wanted flowers were a really important part of my wedding day. I feel like they tie everything together. After countless quotes and experiencing sticker shock many times I found ...

Sweetness and Light. Wendi called me before even giving me a quote to seek out my vision for my wedding day. She created a Pinterest board of ideas to make sure we were on the same page—THEN she did our quote and we created a contract. I feel like we got an incredible deal for the quality we received. As our wedding got closer Wendi made sure our vision was the same and coordinated all the details needed. She worked with our other vendors to make sure that everything was placed correctly and it couldn’t have been more gorgeous. The flowers were beautiful and just what I wanted. Our wedding was outdoors in a garden and I wanted to compliment, not overpower the natural beauty and Wendi did just that. I also love the sustainable model she uses—something I thought might cost us more money but I believe actually is one of the reasons she can be so affordable. I did not preserve my bouquet but I kept it as it wilted and it was still beautiful! I would highly recommend Wendi and her team to any couple in need of flowers!

er comfortable letting her take the reins for everything flower related for our wedding. Not only did everything come out amazingly, we were amazing at how much we got for so little money. When I commented to my brother about how much we spent, he thought it was 10x what we actually spent. That's how much value we felt that Wendi gave us in our flowers. Overall, if there is any doubt about considering Sweetness and Light, there is no need to even have that be a thought in your mind. They will do an amazing job at an amazing price!

rough. She was respectful of our budget and worked hard to make it work with what we desired. After our first conversation, she created a pinterest board of styles and designs like we discussed. I'm a visual person, so this was helpful to have. I knew she understood me and that we were on the same page. I trusted her completely. On the day of the wedding, I was absolutely stunned! My bouquet was perfect. The flowers at the venue and ceremony were so beautiful and transformed the space. It was magical. Our friends and families kept commenting how gorgeous our flowers were. They said the arrangements were the most beautiful that they've seen. Not only is her work flawless, but Wendi is just the sweetest person ever. She genuinely wants you to be happy and to make your wedding day perfect. We feel so lucky to have had her talents on our wedding day, and emphatically recommend her for all your floral needs!

Wendi is the best. She is easy going, easy to work with, added flowers everywhere I wanted them, and then some. And her arrangements were gorgeous.
