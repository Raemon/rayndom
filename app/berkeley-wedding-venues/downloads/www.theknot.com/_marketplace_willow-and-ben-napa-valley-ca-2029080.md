ll day with pictures and ensured that me and my husband got all of the beautiful shots we requested. You can really tell that Ben has a passion for photography and getting that perfect shot!….or in our case A TON of perfect shots. Ben has a fun and positive energy that is contagious that made even my mom, who is a bit camera shy, feel comfortable taking a bunch of photos on wedding day. Soooo many of our wedding guests told us how wonderful he was! And of course we can’t forget about the other half of the photography team, Willow, who does the photo editing! All of the photos were edited to perfection, true to color, and brought out all the best colors and elements of the day without them looking over-edited. AND we were sent a bunch of sneak peak photos just three days after our wedding day! If you are considering Willow and Ben to shoot your wedding photographs or another photoshoot I would absolutely recommend them ten times over! Thank you so much Ben and Willow! We will remember our day beautifully forever because of you two!!

ir artistic vision is incredible, and so many of our friends and family commented on how comfortable they felt around the-like they were a natural part of our day. Ben was especially amazing with our little flower girls, capturing the most stunning shots of them throughout the celebration. He had such a gift for capturing all the key moments, often without us even realizing he was there, which made the photos feel so natural and authentic. We are absolutely in love with our photos and have already printed many favorites to display.

Willow and Ben were a DREAM to work with!!! I am super picky when it comes to photography, and they were absolutely incredible before, on, and after our wedding day! First of all, ...

Ben is super kind, friendly, professional, and enthusiastic about every aspect of the planning. I so appreciated his attention to detail in hearing about our vision; you can tell they care so much and will do whatever it takes to make their clients happy:) on our wedding day, Ben was timely, communicative, and did an incredible job at coordinating the whole day and making sure to execute any specific shots we wanted. He was so kind to stay late when our timeline ran long, and his upbeat attitude made the whole day super fun! We received our sneak peek photos (way more than we expected) within a week of the wedding, and were totally blown away! Booking Willow & Ben was one of the absolute BEST decisions we made when planning our wedding, and they are worth every penny! We highly recommend them to any couple looking for their perfect photographer:)

Ben and Willow are absolute professionals and truly excel at what they do! From our very first meeting, they made us feel confident in our choice and got us hyped for the wedding. ...

Ben described himself as the ultimate hype man, and he definitely lived up to that title! His energy and enthusiasm were infectious, which helped set the tone for our entire wedding journey. We immediately felt at ease and excited to work with them. During our engagement shoot, we met in a busy part of San Francisco at peak traffic time, which could have been a challenging situation. However, Ben went the extra mile to ensure we got all the perfect shots. His ability to navigate the chaos around us and keep the mood light made what could have been a tiring day of picture-taking incredibly fun. His positive and humorous attitude turned the experience into something we genuinely enjoyed, and we left that day feeling even more connected as a couple. As the wedding day approached, my fiancé and I found ourselves feeling a bit overwhelmed. One meeting with Ben was all we needed to relax and feel reassured. He took the time to listen to our concerns and offered valuable insights that made the planning process smoother. On the day of the wedding, he was absolutely fantastic. He provided clear and simple directions to ensure we got all the shots we wanted while also making sure we were comfortable and enjoying the moment. True to his word, Ben was the ultimate hype man throughout the wedding. He kept us smiling and laughing, which helped ease any nerves we had. He captured every shot we requested, as well as those from our families, with a creative flair that made each photo special. The quality of their photo shots and the editing are simply incredible; every image is a work of art that beautifully tells the story of our day. Ben and Willow are the ultimate power couple, and we feel incredibly lucky to have had them as our photographers. Their kindness, enthusiasm, and professionalism are top-notch, and we are eternally grateful for the beautiful memories they created for us. We wholeheartedly recommend them!

tagram and after our first call, we knew we had to book them!! Best decision we made in the whole planning process. When they showed up, we knew it was going to be a great day. Both of them exude kindness, joy, and professionalism. Ben knew our venue Viansa inside and out, guiding us to the best shots based on the time of day and lighting, which allowed us to get our dream pics while maximizing time with our guests. The two of them worked together as the perfect tag team, splitting tasks seamlessly or working in sync to get two different shots of the same moment. They even helped demonstrate couple poses for us :) They didn’t just leave an impact on us — every single member of our wedding party raved about how they felt so held by Willow and Ben’s positive energy during portraits. They are the ultimate hype man/woman and made everyone feel so comfortable in front of the camera, allowing us to really live in the moment and enjoy each other’s company. We have gotten so many compliments on our wedding photos and are so grateful we chose Willow and Ben to capture moments that we will treasure for a lifetime. The absolute best!

If there is one vendor recommendation I can make that will completely alter your wedding (for the better), it would be to choose Willow & Ben as your photographers. Starting with...

the obvious - their photos are just amazing!!! They’ve perfected the art of light and airy pics with real candid moments and character to them. I don’t tend to get emotional easily, but every time I look at our wedding pics, I tear up 🥹😭 Not only are they wildly talented, but Willow and Ben are so incredibly professional. They arrived early, communicated frequently, and made sure to get all of our shots, no sweat (and I mean literally too - it was 103° on our wedding day🥵). Since they’re such rockstars, they were able to work seamlessly with our other vendors as well (hair and makeup, videographers, florists, planners, etc.). It really felt like one cohesive team across all our vendors, with W&B as the glue! Finally, the cherry on top of why we love W&B so much is their kindness for their clients, other vendors, and for each other. It was incredible watching the two of them (husband and wife) shoot our wedding. They could communicate with just a simple glance and would predict each other’s next move, making the pictures enjoyable, short and sweet. Willow was so kind that she even steamed my entire (massive) dress the morning of our wedding🤯 - totally out of the job description but also totally in line with the wonderful person who she is. Those are the type of people you want in your corner on your big day!! Willow and Ben, truly thank you so much for not only capturing the most beautiful pictures we’ve ever seen but also for making our experience so magical. You guys are the best!!!

We found Willow & Ben on instagram and absolutely fell in love! We actually reached out to them before we even found a wedding planner or chose a date. Willow & Ben exceeded our ex...

pectations from day 1. From our initial consultation with them we felt so at peace with the decision to hire them to capture our wedding day. They were very transparent about details/pricing, and our contract process was simple and stress free! All of the vendors we connected with were SO excited when they found out that Willow & Ben were capturing our day, and each of them let us know that they LOVED working with Willow & Ben. Throughout our planning process they touched in frequently and were always professional and genuinely excited for our big day. By the time the wedding week came around we were both so excited to meet them. Ben photographed our rehearsal dinner and immediately put us at ease with his warm demeanor. My husband had not taken professional photos EVER, but Ben made him feel so confident and told both of us exactly what to do! He photographed our rehearsal/ welcome party so beautifully, AND was so gracious and lovely throughout the evening. We were even more excited for the wedding day after our experience with him. Willow & Ben absolutely blew us away on our wedding day. They were timely, organized, and brought so much joy to the day. They made sure to talk through lighting and timing with us beforehand, and provided their recommendations for where to take photos and in what order. We absolutely trusted them and let them lead the way, and we are so glad we did because they were spot on! Wedding photos can obviously take time, but Willow & Ben made it FUN and the photos went by so quickly. In fact, our time spent taking couples photos was one of our favorite parts of the day. Our family and wedding party photos went just as smoothly. Ben made sure the groomsmen had fun and were on time/ where they needed to be, meanwhile Willow captured the girls getting ready process and made sure each of us felt beautiful! The family photos we’re so smooth as Willow & Ben made sure to get our shot list organized during the planning process. Our wedding party, guests, and family ALL commented on how sweet and fantastic Willow & Ben were. They truly brought such a positive energy to the day and I could not be more grateful for that. We received our sneak peak photos while we were on our honeymoon, and spent way too long in our hotel room looking through the album! They delivered SO many sneak peaks and they were all absolutely stunning. We are OBSESSED with all of them. The individuals, couples photos, family/ wedding party photos, candids, and detail shots are all jaw dropping and we could not be happier with them. They captured our day so beautifully and caught every important moment exactly as I hoped they would. We were so happy with the lighting and style of each photo, but even more than that we were so thrilled with how perfectly they captured the joy and love of the day! We are so excited to receive our full album and we have no doubt that they will be just as gorgeous.Thank you so much Willow & Ben. We feel so incredibly blessed to have met y’all, and we know we will look back on these photos with full hearts for the rest of our lives. Your work is truly a priceless gift!

They got our engagement photos to us A DAY later (unheard of in the photography world) and sneak peeks of our wedding photos within a few days. We have not yet received our full wedding album (it has only been about 2 weeks) but we have no doubts that the photos will be amazing.

known them for years as they brought an ease to the day which made us feel so confident in front of the camera. Our wedding day was almost 100 degrees and Ben had the best attitude, a smile on his face the whole time, and did not let the hot weather put a damper on his shots and styling. They have clear experience with managing the flow of pictures and helping to wrangle the extended family together for group shots. We would recommend Willow and Ben to everyone searching for a wedding photographer. They are the best in the business so our advice would be to book them ASAP!

Come wedding day, they were both so sweet and seemed genuinely happy for me and my husband - it seemed like they were part of our friends/family. As awkward as I am in front of the camera, I really appreciated how both Willow and Ben gave clear posing directions and suggestions during our posed photos. They are also so talented at shooting candids - some of my most favorite photos of the evening were the candid shots they got! Overall, working with Willow and Ben was such a lovely experience and highly recommend working with them to anyone getting married!

d I can't even begin to explain how happy I am that Willow and Ben were a huge part of the day. Starting with my engagement shoot about a year ago, Ben did an incredible job scoping out amazing places in San Francisco. I'm assuming there's a large group of gals out there with a significant other who doesn't love taking pictures (like me) and Ben somehow created an incredibly safe and amazing environment that made the session so perfect. My now-husband walked away saying "wow that was fun!"- words I never thought I'd hear him say. Ben made us feel like models and the pictures turned out better than we could have imagined. Fast forward a few months and we're deep in the planning process. Willow and Ben were happy to assist with any questions or thoughts I had, even if they weren't photo-related. Every time I chatted with them, they brought the best energy and enthusiasm. They exude positivity. Now the wedding photos- I only have a sneak peek back at the moment (which they somehow shared with me a few days after) and WOW. They are so beautiful and stunning, I have no words. On top of this, they were so fun to have around on the wedding day and kept me feeling calm and excited. Also, my dad (who is a man of few words) has remarked many times since my wedding about how talented and incredible Willow and Ben are. When I think back on all of the vendors I hired for my wedding, Willow and Ben are #1 by a landslide. THANK YOU FOR BOTH FOR EVERYTHING!

of. From our initial phone call, to engagement shoot, to wedding, they were both so professional, attentive, and caring. They both are so easy to talk to and made us instantly feel comfortable in front of the camera! Not to mention the many different posing prompts they had us do to capture such cute, fun, candid shots. Aside from their sweet, fun personalities, the work they put out is absolute AMAZING. Saying we are in love with both our engagement shoot and wedding galleries is an understatement. Their editing is timeless and natural, so I know that 30 years from now, we will still love our photos. Their eye for aesthetics when it comes to photos is absolutely incredible, as evidenced by the gorgeous flat-lay photos (that Ben laid out and designed in a matter of minutes) as well as the dreamy golden-hour photos. They were both very efficient with time on the wedding day to make sure we got in all the shots we wanted to. They are definitely experienced and know what they are doing! Additionally, they got our sneak-peaks to us at lightning speed, like within a matter of days! They are quick with communication and always answered my questions in a timely manner. I would recommend them in a heartbeat to any couples getting married. Thanks again, Willow & Ben!

w and Ben made it SO easy and our photos are swoon worthy. We first met Ben when he flew down to Los Angele for our engagement session. He was incredibly flexible and went above and beyond to scout the perfect Malibu location. He also did a fantastic job incorporating our dog into a few of the shots. The stunning photos were perfect for our Save the Date and we couldn't resist also using them for our wedding guest book (highly recommend!). During our wedding, Willow & Ben fit right in with our bridal party/family and it felt like we were all friends hanging out. My parents were thrilled with their professionalism - we stuck to our timeline and captured all of the photos we were wanting without dragging out the process. On top of that, Ben was also able capture all the random shot ideas I had texted the days leading up to the big day. He remembered absolutely everything and the photos are FANTASTIC! Thank you Willow & Ben for everything you did to make our day so special. We are so grateful to have these photos to relive our big day for years to come. 10/10 HIGHLY recommend Willow & Ben for your big day!

Willow and Ben are incredibly talented, hard working and kind people. I seriously cannot recommend them enough!! When I started searching for a photographer for my wedding, I quick...

ly realized that they were my dream photographers. From the start, they were great communicators, were so fun and easy to get along with and they understood our vision. From our engagement shoot to our wedding photos, the pictures were truly next level. Unfortunately, Willow was on maternity leave for our wedding day, but they did a great job at finding another awesome photographer that we really liked as well. The day of the wedding Ben showed up and was there 100%. He made everyone feel comfortable, communicated with all other vendors about the timeline, and had a calm and happy attitude throughout the entire day. I loved that the vendors were able to communicate with each other so it was one less thing I had to worry about. I even had people come up to me during and after the wedding, including both my mom and mother in law, and tell me how much they loved our photographer! 10/10 would recommend Willow and Ben if you want magazine quality wedding photos that will last forever. Thank you so much Willow and Ben!!!

I searched for months to find a wedding photographer and as soon as I came across one of willow and bens photos on Instagram, I knew I had found the exact photographers that I want...

ed. Willow and Ben were so easy to communicate with, they kept an open line of contact from the first day I e-mailed them until the wedding day (and even after that day as well)! I knew that I could call, text or e-mail them with any questions that I had and they were get back to me right away. They were so personable and made me feel extremely comfortable from the start. On the wedding day, they went above and beyond. By this day, I had felt like I already knew both of them so well, therefore it made taking pictures that much easier. They made sure to capture every “inspo” picture that I wanted and were constantly running around the venue making sure they had photos of every detail. They also made sure that my hair, makeup and veil were looking good throughout the night, which was something that was important to me :) They were so much more than just a photographer that day and I couldn’t be more thankful that they were the ones to capture this day. In all honestly, they were my hardest goodbye at the end of the night.

Willow and Ben are absolutely incredible, and our wedding day wouldn’t have been the same without them! They felt like family and brought such amazing energy to the wedding day. ...

When we were looking for photographers for our wedding, my husband and I were so impressed with their portfolio. After our first call with them, we immediately felt a connection and knew we’d made the best choice! We did our engagement photoshoot with them, and usually my husband and I are awkward in front of the camera, but Willow and Ben made it feel so natural and fun. Throughout the last year that we’ve worked with them, they’ve been so amazing. They are so fast at responding to any and every question we had and were kind enough to schedule multiple calls leading up to the wedding, including one where they talked to my parents to make sure they had noted every moment the whole family wanted captured on our wedding day. We had an Indian and a Jewish wedding in the same day with many specific and unique traditions, and Willow and Ben perfectly captured everything. Everyone who has seen our engagement and wedding photos has commented on how fantastic our photographers were, and we couldn’t agree more! We HIGHLY recommend them, and we can’t wait to work with them again in the future!

Willow and Ben made my entire wedding day experience! They worked their butts off to make sure my day was captured. Whether you’re getting married in the Napa/San Fran/ Sonoma area...

or not…get Willow and Ben. You will not be disappointed. They communicated with me throughout the whole process with emails, calls, and texts. All my guests loved them. They bring such an infectious energy to the wedding. I really can’t stop bragging about them

Willow & Ben were the first vendors we booked for our wedding after securing our dream wedding venue. We discovered our venue from a photo Willow & Ben had shared to Instagram. It ...

was a dream come true to discover that they were available on our date. From our very first phone call, my fiancé and I knew that we wanted to have them capture our special day. They were friendly, enthusiastic, relatable and energetic. This team was so incredibly helpful every step of the way during our wedding planning process. They would go above and beyond and were always helpful with answering any questions we had regarding our wedding. They even gave us some of our other fantastic vendor recommendations! Almost 2 years later, we had our dream wedding photographed by this dynamic duo. And to put it plainly - they did not disappoint! They brought the energy, positivity and fun vibe. They helped my quieter husband come out of his shell and feel natural in front of the camera. Their editing is gorgeous and they delivered sneak peeks faster than we could have ever imagined. Willow & Ben helped make our special day even sweeter. 10/10 will always recommend this duo to photograph any special event!

From our very first phone call, my husband and I knew Willow and Ben were the absolute perfect fit for our wedding. They are both an absolute dream to work with and every time you ...

talk with them it feels like you are chatting with an age long friend. Throughout our event they were busy shutterbugs getting all the most phenomenal shots, everyone felt very comfortable and Willow & Ben fit in seamlessly. I personally am very self conscious in front of a camera- I know everyone claims the non-photogenic conundrum, but even my partner and family/ friends know I'm renowned for my "Chandler smile". Working with Ben and Willow, all my rigid awkwardness melted and I felt totally at ease being photographed. They were kind, professional, and fun to work with and fabulous on giving direction and positioning to get the perfect shot. They both have an eye for their craft and our photos are absolutely flawless. We couldn't be more pleased and feel very lucky to have had them to document our very special wedding day!

There are SO many decisions that you have to make as an engaged couple, so let us help make this one a little easier: book Willow and Ben now! They are outstanding. From the first ...

call that we had with Ben, my partner and I knew we had to do whatever we could to work with them. Our engagement shoot was rainy, but it didn’t phase them at all. They stayed extremely positive and our photos still turned out beautifully and they even offered to reschedule the shoot if needed. My partner shared that having Ben and Willow at our wedding was like having two close friends there (he also joked about having them for dinner — Willow and Ben, if you’re reading this—that invite stands!). Everyone loved them. Not only do they make you feel so comfy in front of the camera, but their work is truly art. I just hope that we have the chance to work with them again soon :)

Look no further, these two are the real deal. Every single interaction with them was incredible. Our engagement shoot with them was everything we dreamed of and more! They made us ...

feel super comfortable. Having the two of them there to show us poses made it easy. They’re an absolutely dynamic duo who is just as talented with making us look effortlessly candid as they are at producing incredible high-quality photos you’ll wanted framed in your living room for years to come. The engagement session was just a start to the incredible content to come. Once it came to wedding day, they were both on time and made the day flow super well. They captured the best moments. We got our sneak peek with in two days and loved being able to relive the day. The full gallery is an absolute work of art! I even asked them for a few extra photos that didn’t make the full gallery and without hesitation, they had those uploaded in a couple days. They are so accommodating and easy to work with! Hiring these two was a decision we were so glad we made. We had many people ask us if we knew our photographers personally because we were getting along so well! We’re already thinking up more reason to hire Willow and Ben.

We went on a few calls with wedding photographers before we spoke with Willow and Ben but after we met with them, we knew they’d make us feel comfortable on our big day. Excitable ...

is an understatement when you talk to Ben, but you can tell how genuinely excited he is, they seem to truly love their jobs and we’re so happy we chose them. Personality aside, the one other attribute that you’re going to be considering about your wedding photographer is organization. While you don’t want someone overbearing, you want someone who understands the gravity of the event and that the drunk version of the couple might not have the best organizational skills. Willow and Ben were spot on in their delivery to us when they knew there was a photo we needed to take not worth missing. We’re so happy we listened to them. Willow was also a huge asset to my bride during her getting ready process. As an example, my wife was getting to walk and realized that none of her bridesmaids knew how to put on her veil, Willow stepped up and like a pro attached that thing in no-time. No ego, just knew it needed to get done. Boom. The intangible value that Willow and Ben bring is during their photography process itself with just bride and groom. My wife and I had never taken engagement or professional photos before and she was super nervous about how she should be posing or looking in certain scenarios. Because Willow and Ben are a couple, they instantly provide an example of the walk or the look that they were looking for with a specific shot. It sounds like a small detail, but I can’t tell you how at ease it put my partner and I. We’ll honestly miss these guys very much and hope you choose them for you big day!

They helped us with poses and gave us great direction during the entire process capturing all of the best moments. AND THE PHOTOS! We are so impressed and beyond happy with how our photos turned out.

Our venue has some awesome views and they were able to capture those in our photos as well. I definitely recommend Willow & Ben for your photography needs. They are professional, talented, and so fun! Thank you Willow & Ben for everything you did to make our day so special. I'm thankful we have these photos to relive our big day for years to come.

photographers provide in their final submission. Ben was up for anything - ran around on a 4-wheeler with us to get sunset photos on top of a ridge overlooking the vineyard. He was so much fun, made everyone feel comfortable, and entirely flexible when timelines changed. Talented, professional and just a joy to work with! The candids were incredible. Ben captured all the little moments during the first look, the ceremony and and the first dance. Incredible!

t shots and then our wedding a year later. These two were likable from the first call we had, and then when we did our engagement shots, they blew us away with their smiles, fun energy, passion for their work, and utmost professionalism and overall skill - clearly super seasoned photographers. Not only was the engagement session a BLAST - Ben scouting the spots for perfect lighting and background, while Willow was getting us into these creative poses - the pictures we got back were truly INCREDIBLE. Like ‘instantly make it your screensaver’ amazing. We still have our prints posted all over our house today. On wedding day, they picked up right where we left off, expertly capturing the big and small moments of the day. At one point my groomsman were commenting on how professional and skilled our photographers were that made it so easy to get all the wedding party shots in so smoothly. Willow and Ben are not only great at what they do, but they are the type of couple we admire and want to be friends with. W + B have the kind of obvious joy and passion for their work that inspires you to be better at your own job. 6/5 stars.

Since the moment I met them at a wedding expo, they were very friendly and down to Earth which is what I initially appreciated about them, aside from their wonderful display of pictures and portfolio. Once I made the decision to hire them, they continued to be kind and great with their communication. I eventually had to post pone my wedding three separate times due to the pandemic, and they were always happy and willing to work with me on my new dates. The day of my wedding they arrived at a great time and got straight to work capturing all of my details, while I was busy getting my makeup/hair done. They were efficient in knowing how to time the day to get shots from both bridal parties, pre and post ceremony shots, fun party shots, and so many more moments that I didn’t even realize. I am so glad I hired Willow and Ben to capture my special day. Best decision ever!
