Every wedding deserves a video to capture such a special day, and if you're lucky enough to work with Filmman video, you won't regret it. We viewed tens of potential videographers ...

and hundreds of videos before ultimately selecting Filmman, and when we saw the final product, we thanked our lucky stars we did. The way they captured our day was absolutely perfect, and the way they told the story could not have been more apt. We had a complicated schedule for the day, which didn't deter them whatsoever. They are delightful to work with, take instruction well, and you can have confidence in their expertise - and that's not even mentioning that they turned the video around in less than a week! Pick Filmman for your wedding!!

Truly the best in the business, and the best possible team to capture our wedding day. Photography and videography were always a big priority for us, and we began our search for th...

e perfect photography/videography team two years before our wedding. While I had researched and interviewed over 40 photographers, I hit the jackpot with Filmman Studios. They were one of the first videography teams I spoke to and immediately I knew they would be the people I wanted to hire. Christina was bubbly, sweet, fun, patient. As an added bonus, her and George both speak Mandarin and Cantonese — perfect for communicating with our wedding guests. Beyond their personalities, their films spoke for themselves, two words “cinematic masterpieces.” On top of that, their pricing was extremely reasonable. On the day of, Christina and George showed up 1 hour early. Christina, just like she had been on the phone, was BURSTING with energy. She ran up to me, wrapping me in a big hug and I yelped out “wow it is so good to finally meet my wedding vendors!” My bridesmaids were confused, “You’ve never met her before? You guys seem like best friends.” That sentiment held true for the rest of the day. Shooting with Christina and George really did feel like hanging out with great friends. They laughed at our TikTok video creations, danced with us on the dance floor, and handed my husband and I tissues when we could not stop crying at our first look. What was the most impressive was the way they were somehow able to both direct and encourage, all while allowing my husband and I to have (what felt like) very personal and private moments throughout the day. Then, just 4 days after our wedding, I got a text from Christina saying our video was ready. My husband and I shakily opened the link and we were waterworks all over again. It was perfection — from the way it started with funny “blooper” scenes to the way it incorporated our vows and romantic shots. When we sent to our friends and family, no one could believe this video was made literally less than 100 hours after our wedding. Christina surprised us with beautiful drone shots, interviews with family and friends and the perfect shot of our first look which is and will be my most favorite memory of the day. Christina and George, I can just tell how passionate you are about your jobs. You have created pure magic for us and our families. Thank you for being a part of our special day.

9/15/2024: Fantastic Experience with Christina, George, and Filmman! Christina, George, and the Filmman team were absolutely excellent. They were the perfect partners for our wedd...

ing for so many reasons: 1\. Respectful and Kind: On the day of the wedding, they were a bright light. They treated our family with kindness and always checked in respectfully to ensure they captured everything we wanted. 2\. Excellent Quality: Having worked with Christina on a previous family wedding, we had no doubt about her skill and cinematic talent. Once again, she delivered beautifully. 3\. Responsiveness: Christina was always incredibly responsive and collaborative when it came to designing our highlight video, and in helping to bring our vision to life. Go with Christina, George, and the Filmman team – you won’t regret it! 12/15/2023: We decided to strongly consider Christina and Filmman for our wedding because she had done an excellent job at my to-be-sister-in-law's wedding. She quickly confirmed that working with her was going to be a great experience. We'll update this review when our wedding date comes to pass, but for now we wanted to write a review just to emphasize how excellent Christina is to work with in the pre-contract and negotiation phase: 1\. Professionalism: She is quick to reply, thorough in communication, kind in spirit, and committed to ensuring you are provided the package you need. 2\. Better Packages: Moreover, compared to other videographers, it's our view that she has a more compelling offering. She has certain packages that offer long-form edits – providing (from what we saw with our family member's wedding) the best way to retain a significant amount of the big day in a quality, usable format. 3\. Great Style: Finally, the short films that she creates are a lot more cinematic and story-oriented than most wedding films we've seen. Put another way, they tell a story more like what a filmmaker would do in a typical context, driven by voice-overs and compelling imagery – not following as much the classic wedding film tropes that can be a bit overwrought.

who didn't have much direction of what I expected the video to be like, and as someone who felt somewhat awkward being filmed (regardless of what a great job they did making me feel comfortable) -- I was absolutely amazed at the wonderful job they did filming and editing the video. Beyond the final product, I wanted to mention that it was a pleasure working with them in general. Christina was always quick to respond before the wedding, was full of ideas, and was very on time the day of the wedding. Both Christina and her team also brought such a cheerful spirit to the wedding day, and we're super grateful to have had them as part of our wedding team.

all the important details and moments. The highlight and video were ready pretty quickly and I cannot explain how professional and beautiful the video came out, it was worth every penny. My family and I have watched the video several times and every time we all get emotional and re-live the day all over again. Thank you Filmman Video!

We had a great experience hiring FilmmanVideo for our wedding! Here are highlights of working with them: Prior to the event, Christina called and clearly prepared us for what wo...

uld need to be filmed. George arrived early, gave clear direction, and was fast and efficient with the shots he wanted to get. When it wasn’t his time to film, he was very kind, patient, and easy to work with. After the wedding we paid for rush delivery, which they completed on time. They also were able to make small edits at our request with a very fast turn around, so that we had the exact highlight video we wanted. If it matters, they are fluent in English, Mandarin, and Cantonese (this helped because my bride is Taiwanese). They are very experienced with wedding videos and it shows with their efficiency and professionalism.

THEY ARE SO CHEAPPPPPPP!!!! That's what was going through my mind the entire time as I was watching our highlight video. (Oh and this is so, so, so, good) Yup you heard it how mu...

ch they charge is way, way, wayyyyyyyy too affordable for the value they deliver. I'm an avid photo and videographer with pro gears. Yet, the shots Christina and her husband had throughout our entire 5 plus minutes of highlight video. I wouldn't even able to replicate a fraction of it! And the fraction I think I might be able to replicate I don't think I would have been able to done it in the fly like they did! Not only did Christina and her husband's has some of the best, latest gears, (They have multiple A7sIII, which is fantastic under low lights!!!) They were also super enthusiastic, funny, yet professional, and so so so so well versed in their craft. They did not just capture my wedding but they captured the essence of it. When watching the video we feel as if we were there reliving every moment. And that my friend is something $$$ cannot buy. Tip them generously because holy smoke what the hell. How are they so cheap?!?!! HOW ARE THEY SO CHEAP?!?!?! Surpassed our expectation in everyway at an extremely affordable reasonable rate. We are so grateful to be able to find Filmman group because without them our wedding would have not been complete. Oh yeah, and our wedding video just in case you want to see what all my fuss is about: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAEmZO0vhFI&ab_channel=WillShi

so fast that you’re not able to remember much of it and it’s nice to be able to look back on the video and re-live the memories! Christina and George both speak mandarin and that was really helpful for us when we thought we would have our parents be a bigger part of the wedding, but decided against it! They somehow got the feelings of the video just right for us and we can’t wait to show our family and friends!

lutely beautiful and they make sure to capture all the important moments. My husband and I were so happy that we found Christina and her husband George to be part of our big day. Christina and George are seriously couple goals to work together seamlessly! Communication with Christina was so easy and she always was super quick to respond to emails. Whether it was through email or text, she would always respond right away. Even though we did not give her much instructions on what to record for the wedding day, she was able to capture everything flawlessly. The wedding footage was even better than what we expected. Christina was able to provide the highlight video via a Vimeo link and the rest of the wedding footage was sent via a USB stick. The USB was not just a normal USB; it was a wooden USB in a wooden box with their logo on it - very cute! My husband and I watched the videos and were amazed at the quality and effort that Filmman put into the editing. We will be enjoying our wedding film for the years to come and can't wait to show our kiddos later on. Thank you Filmman for being a part of our special day. We appreciate you! I highly recommend them if you are looking for a videographer :)

’re so glad we decided to do it and hire them for capturing our big day. As two individuals who are absolutely clueless in front of a camera, we found it extremely easy and comforting to work with Christina and George. They did a great job of directing and interviewing us and our wedding party to create professional footage and highlights. For the candid and “documentary” shots (vows, first dance, speeches, etc), the end product was also beyond our expectations. The artistic angles and special moments they capture on camera are just irreplaceable - the iPhone recordings from your guests won’t do it justice. Being able to see each other, our guests and all the little details of our wedding in movie-like quality is something we’re treasure for the rest of our lives. Check out their website for examples of their work! Besides their end product, their service and attentiveness are also 10/10. Working with Christina honestly made our lives so much easier. We had to reschedule and change our day’s timeline multiple times, and she never bat an eye - actually, she had a lot of great suggestions and input throughout the planning process that really helped guide us to make the day perfect. On the day of, they operate with absolute precision and timeliness and are just a superhuman team. They fit seamlessly with our photography team and knew exactly what to do with our venue and all our guests (bonus for bilingual service in Chinese). Honestly, I don’t know how they did everything with just two of them running around, over two locations and 8+ hours. They even included beautiful aerial shots with a drone that we didn’t even know was part of the package! Absolutely incredible experience and product, we are so thankful and grateful for their work. Thank you Christina and George for everything!

On the day of, both she and George were so dedicated throughout - they coordinated extremely well with our photographers, and many of our guests commented to us how hard they were working nonstop to capture the perfect shots. Within 1-2 weeks after the event, they shared the highlight and we truly couldn't have been happier with the incredible video they put together for us - with drone shots, amazingly professional shooting angles, and so much more. It was so beautiful that we ended up ordering an additional extended cut. Their team is special in that they're not only expert at capturing precious moments, but also in turning them into a cinematic and emotional story which captures touching dynamics between the couple, family, and guests - and the product is something that we'll treasure for the rest of our lives. They were also very generous, meticulous, and patient with letting our family make many minor edits throughout the video editing process. Overall, it was a fantastic and worthwhile investment - truly a great value for what you pay for - and we couldn't recommend them more highly.

-postponed wedding reception on 10.02.21. The silver lining to us having to plan/re-plan two wedding celebrations during a pandemic is that we got to work with FilmmanVideo twice! Christina and George are the sweetest and so amazing to work with! My husband and I felt so at ease and natural working with them that it felt like we were family! Communication with FilmmanVideo was always so prompt and easy. Christina (main contact) was also so responsive and very honest and transparent with scheduling suggestions and various wedding planning inputs. E-mail, text, phone call - we would always get responses in a very timely manner. We were so excited when we received the USB stick containing our wedding videos in the mail as we knew that they would be spectacular. Many of our guests have commented that the wedding videos that FilmmanVideo have produced for us really are like professional movie studio quality! The work Christina and George do really is second to none. They really have such an amazing artistic eye in capturing all the special and perfect moments. We have quite a few friends who have also used FilmmanVideo for their weddings (and they recommended FilmmanVideo to us) and all of us are very happy and beyond satisfied customers. You simply cannot go wrong if you choose FilmmanVideo to capture your special day! Book them now before it's too late!

Unlike some videographers who did all the wedding videos in a template like way, filmman really make each video tailored to you, make it so special to record all the moments of your big day. The package I got was $2699, which include 8hr coverage with 2 videographer + all raw edited footage + 5-6 minutes wedding highlight + free hosting on Vimeo + Final encoded in MP4 video (HD 1080P) If you are interested in talking to them, please don't hesitate to reach out to me (Email: yh2449@gmail.com) as they grant the same package price if it is referred from a previous client (I locked in my package with them before COVID, and now it costs $2999). So I am happy to pass along the referral discount here and wish you have the best experience recorded for your wedding!

y (We weren't planning to have a videographer at our wedding, but then heard not having one was one of a bride's biggest regrets). It's been a few months so I don't remember exactly what led me to finally decide on Christina and George - probably some combination of their very reasonable prices, Christina's professionalism, and their highlight videos being sweet but not too cheesy (exactly what we wanted!) - but I am very happy I did. On the day of the wedding, they arrived early at our first location. They were quick to set up and started filming right away (while not bumping into our photographer, who was running the show). It was clear they came prepared with a vision for our wedding video, and knew ahead of time what sort of footage they wanted to capture. This was very welcome as we were falling behind schedule and everything just started moving at 3x the pace. The whole day they were very professional, kind, and respectful. I received my highlight video shortly after and it was much better than we had all expected. My wife's grandmother watched it at least five times so far and cried every single time. My mother-in-law keeps saying I look like James Bond in the video (and believe me, I do not look like James Bond). This just goes to show how skillful Christina and George are at making you the star of your story. For anyone reading up to this point, congratulations on your wedding! You will definitely not regret going with Christina and George.
