Rachael is an amazing artist! She's a creative genius who can match any vision and budget. She made our wedding more special than we ever hoped it would be! The flowers she desig...

ned for our wedding at Vine Hill House on Sunday June 5th were absolutely breathtaking. From the beginning we wanted the "decor" to focus on the natural beauty of the surroundings - with vibrant flowers to heighten that and tie everything together. We also wanted the flowers to help make the whole event feel uniquely "us." Somehow she did all of that within our budget - and it was even better than we'd ever imagined.

Rachael is an absolute artist!!! I got married this fall and was floored by the bouquets and arrangements she made to help us decorate the events leading up to our wedding. I would...

have absolutely loved to have her do the florals at our wedding itself. Unfortunately, I didn't come across her in my initial search and had already contracted with another florist for the day. That being said, I just feel so incredibly grateful to have met her at all as she added so much beauty and color to the week leading up to it our big day. Rachael is so professional and has exquisite taste. After a quick discussion detailing our goals for the arrangements and our style preferences, I thought I knew what to expect. I absolutely love the natural, wildflower-inspired look and bouquets full of movement, but she took the brief and absolutely hit it out of the park! Her creations were a gorgeous explosion of color and texture. Stunning doesn't even begin to cover it! I'm so glad they could be incorporated into some of our getting ready photos so they are captured forever. I also salvaged as many flowers as I could for drying so these beautiful flowers could live on. Thank you, Rachael, for doing what you do!!

I cannot say enough good things about Rachael and Absolutely Wild Flower Artistry!! From the very beginning, Rachael was warm and friendly and more than willing to work with me and...

my budget. She was always quick to respond to emails and questions and so helpful in designing our flowers. We went back and forth on what we wanted to do for centerpieces and Rachael found the most beautiful compotes to use as rental items. We wanted a simple, natural and romantic vibe with lots of white and green and she totally nailed it! I felt so special on our day and can't thank her enough!!

Rachael, the owner, did my flowers. You can really tell this woman loves what she does. And it shows in her work. I got married in Sonoma, CA but live in NY. She made it so easy fo...

r me and I got such a warm vibe from her. I loved her style, it was unlike any other florist in the area. It was bohemian but classy. It was unique and perfect. It was whismsical and flowed with the decor of my winery Sonoma wedding. I trusted her with everything, I gave her a few Pinterest ideas and my colors, (and told her I love seahollys). And she made me the most beautiful bouquet, nature-esc boutonnières for the guys, she hung lanterns from the trees with flowers spilling from them, and arrangements of all sizes everywhere. I can't say enough about her. And she worked with my price range completely. She gave me the biggest hug and I could genuinely tell that she wanted me to be happy. I didn't feel like "just another bride/client" to her. I cannot recommend her enough !! I wish I could put pictures up. Her work made my Sonoma fairytale wedding come true !
