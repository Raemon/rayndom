Best experience ever!!! They provide such amazing service, Debbie was so nice and kind. She let me chose as many dresses as I wanted to try, but there was no need for me to try the...

m all since I fell in love with the second dress I tried on. All the other staff members gave me such nice compliments and it made me feel so comfortable and confident in saying yes to the dress. They have a lot of beautiful dresses to choose from and their fitting room sections with the big mirror and lighting make you feel like an actual model. I definitely recommend coming here! So worth it!! I truly felt like a bride!

f there within an hour . Staff was very friendly and made me feel welcome. They said I was the quickest bride ever to pick out a dress 😂 . I clearly hope to never have to shop for a dress again, but I would highly recommend A Touch of Class. They seem to have a great Tuxedo collection as well.

I found my dress at A Touch of Class Bridal, and I loved it! Admittedly, it's a strange time to be dress shopping and wedding planning, so I wasn't sure what my experience would b...

e like. I have to say I was thrilled with the outcome! In this pandemic, they had reopened with MANY safety precautions (which made me feel safe and comfortable) and I was the only bride in the shop. I got to send dress requests ahead of time, so they were prepared when I arrived, they chose new styles for me to try on based on other dresses I'd selected, and they let me peruse and pick more as well. I had a great time! I recommend them highly!

fancy and is quite small, but it is quite a large selection and everyone that worked there was quite pleasant to be around! They made me feel comfortable and were not pushy at all!

Today, I said YES to the dress! I had only been to one other retailer to try dresses on and did not have a very good experience, so I was hoping this would be different. I did a lo...

t of online shopping, but knew I needed to try some dresses on. So I made an appointment and went in today with my mom and cousin. Judy and her partner, Lindsay, run the store, with Judy’s husband Rick also helping out. Rick greeted us and gave us tags that we used to mark dresses I wanted to try on while Judy finished up an appointment. The store was not huge, but rather intimate with so many dresses neatly lined up on racks. The store was nicely and comfortably decorated and laid out. It took us about 20 minutes to look through all the dresses and tag the ones we wanted to try on. The curtained dressing area was big with full-length mirrors and a pedestal step, with comfortable chairs placed outside. Judy helped me get into all of my dresses and was so knowledgeable about every dress in the store. She was knowledgeable about the designers, the styles, and any possible alterations or changes. She told me pretty much any changes I wanted could be made to any dress. That helped me feel more excited about dress shopping, which had honestly been a very overwhelming and stressful process for me until I went into A Touch of Class. Judy had a very good idea of what I was looking for after seeing the dresses I picked out. She was amazing and shared anecdotes from other brides (she calls her customers her “girls”) and background about her, Rick, and the store. We had fun chatting and trying on dresses. The dress I ended up choosing was NOTHING like the dresses I had been looking at. She told me she had been walking past the dress I ended up with to put other dresses away during my appointment and three different times she thought: “she needs to try that dress on,” but she kept telling herself that it was not what I was looking for. Finally, she asked my mom and cousin what they thought and said she wanted to see me in it because she thought it would be very flattering to my figure. I tried the dress on for fun, but ended up absolutely loving it! It is so beautiful and elegant with very exquisite, beautiful lace. I absolutely love it. I told Judy she is “The Dress Whisperer.” She called Rick and Lindsay over to come see me in the dress, as well. Judy and Rick are wonderful people, very kind and friendly with great senses of humor. Lindsay is also a very sweet lady. I really appreciate them all so much and just felt so comfortable there— like family. I had such a wonderful and perfect experience today and I’m so happy that I found a dress and that I absolutely love dress that I picked. I have been floating on a cloud all day after that appointment. Not only do they have a great variety of dresses here without being overwhelming like some other bridal retailers, but the prices are so reasonable. Many of the dresses are actually discounted, and Judy was kind enough to put a small discount on my dress even though it was not one of the ones that was marked down. They also sell men’s suits and tuxedos for very reasonable prices and prom, bridesmaids, and mother-of-the-bride gowns. I am so happy and cannot recommend A Touch of Class enough.

Anjelica, Fran, and Judy were lovely! My mom and I had a positive experience shopping for my wedding dress here. We had fun walking around the shop and choosing dresses for me to...

try on. Then, Anjelica expertly assisted me into each one. Anjelica's warmth and kindness made my experience great. I felt like she really listened to me. A Touch of Class Bridal is definitely worth a visit!

The shop isn't fancy but I thought the friendliness of a small shop more than made up for it when I came in to buy the dress. Unfortunately, after this there was quite a lot of dis...

organization in the ordering and delivery of the dress. The dress is late, without a delivery timeframe, with two weeks to the wedding date. Things happen, and a kind and straightforward communication style can give you confidence that at least whatever can be done is being done. Unfortunately, they have just been condescending and brushed off my questions about where we stand. The reason I wrote this review is to warn anyone in a similar time crunch that this isn't the right shop. I did have a rush order, so I'm definitely more worried about timing than most ladies. Overall, if you don't need your shop to be very organized in a short time frame and don't need to communicate with them beyond ordering and picking up your dress, this place would be just fine. PS know your measurements before going in and insist on choosing your size based on the manufacturers guide.

I bought my wedding dress here last year and while it wasn't perfect, I had a good experience overall. The owner and the consultants were friendly and helpful, and there was no sno...

bby attitude or sales pressure like I encountered at other places in my search. I will say that I found their selection to be the weakest of the three shops I went to, but this is a matter of personal taste more than anything else, so others might not feel that way. Besides, the most important thing is that I found my dress there, so they obviously had enough options that I liked! Most importantly, I felt like they listened to what I wanted more than either of the other places I went. I had found a "maybe" dress at another shop the day before, which I told them about right away. I'm glad I did (I had thought about not telling them so it wouldn't affect how they went through the appointment with me) because after I described it to them and told them why I liked it so much, they went straight to the dress I eventually chose for my wedding. The fact that they listened to what I was saying and really understood the reasoning behind why I liked the first dress was so helpful, because I never would have pulled the dress from the rack myself. It really didn't look like my "maybe" dress at all - it just shared a few key characteristics that they heard in my description of why I liked the other dress. Their knowledge of what it would look like on me and how it related to my likes/dislikes was a huge benefit, and made me feel much more comfortable in their hands. There was a snafu with the order date, though it worked out ok in the end. They had looked at the ship dates wrong because there were two versions of the dress (one corset back, one zip) and they gave me the dates for the corset when I wanted the zip. I did have to pay a small rush fee to get the version I wanted, but it wasn't the end of the world. And I appreciated that they showed me the actual dates for each version of the dress in all options - with no rush, with a basic rush, and with an extra rush delivery. There was also some disappointment when my actual dress wasn't quite as perfectly made as the sample. Maybe because it was a rush order? There was a sheer detail on the bust line under the top layer of lace, and the lace was just a little crooked on my dress while it had appeared perfectly centered on the sample. Unfortunately we couldn't completely fix it without taking apart the entire dress, but I worked with their incredibly nice seamstress (she was wonderful throughout) to come up with a decent solution and I was happy with it in the end. I didn't want to give a perfect 5 star rating because of these little things that could have been better, and it definitely doesn't have as high-end a feeling or appearance as several other shops in the area, but overall I would recommend them to anyone looking for help finding the right dress. They listen very well and really work with you to find something you love, which was way more important to me than just feeling like I was in a fancy shop.

When I first got engaged, I went out to lunch with my mom to celebrate. After lunch, we were driving by A Touch of Class Bridal and thought it would be fun to take a peak inside. ...

The staff were friendly and we were allowed to look through the gowns. One particular attendant helped us look and even helped me try one of the gowns on. My mom and I instantly fell in love. As it was fitted on me, it resembled an A-line/sheath dress with a natural waist. And the gown was made of a solid panel of lace. It was slightly outside of my budget, but I decided that my mom and I agreeing on a dress was a sign to buy it. That is when things started to go downhill. When the attendant first tried to fit me, she kept having problems and had to retake my measurements multiple times. As I am within the range of average size, this was surprising. Then, when filling out the paperwork, it was suggested to me that I should purchase a “Hollow-to-Hem” measurement. I was told this is a measurement of the hollow of the throat to the hem of the gown and would allow the manufacturers to build the gown to my height. Since I am 5’ 3”, and bridal gowns are normally constructed for 5’ 10” models, this seemed like a great idea. The measurement was an additional $150 charge. When the attendant went to measure my hollow to hem, she couldn’t seem to get the math to add up. The owner of the store even had to help her. They spent 15 minutes measuring me until they finally felt comfortable with the numbers. The last detail was accounting for the height of the heels I wanted to wear on the day of. Since I wanted to wear 3” heels, they added 3” to the measurement. (The first measurement was taken with me barefoot). After that, they told me the dress would be in in 3 months and would call. Three months later, I got the call the dress was in. I let them know that when I picked up the dress, I was bringing in my parents, my future in laws and extended family of the groom. On the phone, they were more than happy to accommodate us. At the time of the phone call, I paid the balance of the dress. When I went in to pick up the dress with my family and future family, the tone was completely different. The original attendant who helped me acted tired, disinterested, bored, and annoyed. When I was fitted with the dress, I noticed it was much longer than I had anticipated. With 3” heels on it was 6” too long. And, at the end of the appointment, the original attendant asked me, in front of my entire family, “So, we have one last deal of business. You need to pay.” I was completely insulted. As she was the one who processed my credit card on the phone, I was confused why she would confront me in this manner. I immediately explained that I had paid by phone and pulled out my receipt. Without reading the receipt, she just said “Oh, yeah.” Fast forward until 2 and a half months before my wedding. The bridal gown did not fit. It was not only 6 inches too long, but it did not fit the way the attendant had fitted me in the sample dress. It was actually a ball gown with an empire waist, not an A-line with a natural waist. Due to the construction of the dress (a solid panel of lace), numerous seamstresses refused to work on the dress due to the sheer amount of work it would take to shorten the hem. The one seamstress who was willing to do it, quoted me a price of $1000+.

They didn't have to much of a selection. Ordering was going to be 6 weeks at least.
