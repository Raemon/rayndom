In South Asian traditions, the days and weeks before the wedding are just as joyful and celebratory as the big day itself. There are events, both big and small, that bring together friends and family across generations to support the couple, and the dholki is one of the most festive occasions.

Typically thought of as a [Pakistani wedding tradition](https://www.theknot.com/content/pakistani-wedding-traditions), the dholki shares a name with a small folk drum that plays a critical role in the song and dance that are the center of the celebration. "The dholki symbolizes joy, family unity and cultural heritage," explains Pranav Ojha, also known as DJ Pram of [Rang Entertainment](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/rang-entertainment-llc-bradenton-fl-2087858) based in Bradenton, Florida. "It's a gathering that brings close friends and family together before the larger wedding events."

Today, the dholki wedding event continues as a meaningful and exuberant event in South Asian weddings, particularly among [Muslim wedding](https://www.theknot.com/content/muslim-wedding-ceremony-rituals) traditions. Ojha adds, "At its heart, the dholki represents the passing down of traditions and blessings to the bride or groom through music and community celebration."

To plan a dholki at your own wedding, there are both age-old customs and modern adaptations to take into account. Here's what two South Asian wedding experts have to say about everything from who gets a dholki invite to the songs, decor and outfits to incorporate.

## What Is a Dholki?

A dholki is an [Indian wedding custom](https://www.theknot.com/content/hindu-wedding-guest-qa) that takes place a few weeks before the wedding, and it's often seen as one of the kickoff events to the joyful wedding season. Traditionally, a dholki party was held at the bride's home, but today, it could be at a restaurant, event space or even the groom's home.

"The dholki is a way to have an intimate gathering before other wedding events," says Uzair Iqbal, events manager at [Indus Occasions](https://www.instagram.com/indusoccasions/) in San Antonio. "It can also symbolize a particular closeness with those who organize the dholki. Depending on the number of close friends, family friends and relatives, it is possible to have many dholkis organized for the bride by different people."

Iqbal explains that the word dholki comes from the name of a drum that is played during the celebration. "Usually, a woman who knows how to play a dholak according to the tempo of the songs would play. She would sit on the ground with all the females sitting in a circle around her." Historically, this event would have been limited to the females within a family, but today, you'll often see coed gatherings full of music and dancing.

### Find your kind of venue

From barns to ballrooms, discover reception venues that feel like you.

## Who Receives a Dholki Invitation?

Looking back at the origins of the dholki, it was only women who received an invite. The bride's close family and friends would gather around her before the wedding, and, as Iqbal says, "It is common to have only women and young girls invited since they can dance and sing more freely without men looking."

However, today, couples often join together for a festive evening where the invitation list is kept close, but it's not limited to a single gender. "In many families, women lead the singing, but today both men and women join in the music and dancing," Ojha adds.

## Parts of a Dholki

The dholki's roots go back centuries, but there are aspects of the celebration that have remained consistent through the years. From traditional and modern songs to decor, food and attire, these are the parts of a dholki event that tie it back to generations before.

### Dholki Songs

Music is at the core of the dholki, and much of the music selection features the beat of the dholak drum. "The songs are meant to be lively and classic. Many have been played at our mom's or grandparents' dholkis," Iqbal says. "The music brings everyone together."

Often, the songs feature female singers, and, as Iqbal explains, there is a wide variety of Punjabi language selections, which are particularly popular among Pakistani dholki celebrations. Ojha adds, "Modern families also incorporate Bollywood hits and Punjabi beats to blend tradition with fun, ensuring all generations can join in."

  * "Lathe di Chadar" by Musarat Nazim 
  * "Mehndi Hai Rachnewali"
  * "Kala Sha Kala"
  * "Lathe Di Chadar"



### Dholki Decor

While a dholki is usually held at a private home due to its smaller nature, the decor is always vibrant and fun. "The decor is meant to be bright colors like bright pink, yellow, rich purples, deep reds and gold," Iqbal explains. "The decor would have some sort of a backdrop with those colors, with seating for the bride, while everyone is seated on the ground singing songs." 

Often, you'll see colorful pom poms, glittering details and garlands that add a richly hued whimsy to the space. "Bright, colorful setups with marigolds, string lights and patterned fabrics create an authentic dholki atmosphere," Ohja says.

### Dholki Food

While there are plenty of opportunities throughout an Indian or South Asian wedding season for enjoying elaborate meals, the dholki typically isn't one of those times. This celebration focuses on the music, dancing and merriment, so the food stays lighter than on other occasions. Ojha explains, "Lighter, festive snacks and sweets are common, like samosas, pakoras, chaat, jalebi and mithai platters. Families often choose fun, shareable foods over a formal dinner."

### Dholki Outfits

The couple will wear traditional [Muslim wedding attire](https://www.theknot.com/content/what-to-wear-to-a-muslim-wedding) or South Asian outfits for the dholki. These are more relaxed than the outfits they'll wear for the wedding day, but they're still festive and colorful. "The bride would wear yellow or any other bright colored traditional South Asian outfits with jewelry, embroidery and bangles," Iqbal says.

Ojha adds that women may wear lehengas, salwar kameez or sarees in bold colors, and men may wear a kurta.

### Other Dholki Customs

Other commonly seen customs during a dholki celebration include floor seating with cushions and gao takiya cushions, particularly since the number of guests may exceed the amount of seating in the home.

There may also be a sense of levity throughout the songs and dancing. "Some families incorporate playful rituals, like teasing songs directed at the groom's family, or choreographed dances by cousins and siblings," Ojha says. "What makes the dholki so special is that it's often the first real celebration that kicks off the wedding festivities, creating a sense of anticipation and joy that carries into the bigger events."
