AWARD WINNER (5X)

Thanks to recommendations from couples on The Knot

The Palm Event Center in the Vineyard is a contemporary private winery estate located in the heart of Livermore Valley Wine Country. Nestled against rolling hills and set amongst 110 acres of vineyards, this venue has plenty of picturesque views and photo-op spots. The star is the Palm's sprawling palm tree-lined driveway - which makes for an impressive entrance to the property. Featuring ample outdoor space and views, guests will truly feel as if they are in wine country. The venue allows for couples to choose an indoor or outdoor ceremony and accommodates up to 350 guests in the Ballroom for a reception. Spacious enough for big guest parties, but cozy enough for smaller ones, the Ballroom features a stunning wall of candles as a focal point for the head table. In addition, wine barrels and tea light candles are carefully placed amongst the rooms to give it a romantic glow. The outdoor ceremony lawn features a 180-degree view of the vineyards as couples say "I Do." There is also outdoor patio space for cocktails or s'mores later in the evening. In booking the Palm, you will receive a beautiful property to get married at, as well as award-winning catering, and day-of event coordination services. Their inclusive packages feature an elegant wedding menu, 4.5 hours of full bar service, an event coordinator to handle all the logistics, and everything needed to host your wedding meal service (tables, chiavari chairs, dinnerware, glassware, flatware, linens, etc.). It is the perfect place to host your guests as you say your vows. We are an LGBTQ+ friendly business. We are an inclusive space.

as the venue has. The staff there is amazing and so attentive. We felt really taken care of the day of the day off and our guests felt the same way. The food, the drinks, everything was so good! Our wedding coordinator Brittany was great, I’m so appreciative of all she did the day off to help move things along and help out when we had delays. All the staff was so helpful in so many different ways, I can’t thank them enough for all their wonderful work. During the planning phases they were also very responsive and helped up work through a lot of details to bring our vision to life. They had great suggestions and ideas as well. We couldn’t have chosen a better place to celebrate our love.

From the moment we toured The Palm Event Center, we knew it was the perfect place to host our wedding. The venue itself is absolutely stunning—lush gardens, elegant interiors, and ...

a romantic atmosphere that made our special day truly magical. But what made it even more extraordinary was the impeccable service we received, especially from our coordinator, Brittany. Brittany was an absolute gem throughout the entire process. She was attentive, organized, and went above and beyond to ensure that every detail was taken care of. She helped us with everything from the timeline to last-minute changes, making sure we were stress-free and able to enjoy every moment. On the day of the wedding, Brittany’s calm, professional demeanor was a lifesaver, and she orchestrated everything flawlessly. The staff at The Palm Event Center were also incredible—friendly, accommodating, and made sure everything ran smoothly. The food was phenomenal, the decorations were beyond what we had imagined, and our guests couldn’t stop raving about the venue. If you’re looking for a wedding venue that provides stunning ambiance and top-tier service, look no further than The Palm Event Center. And if you’re lucky enough to have Brittany as your coordinator, you can rest assured knowing your day will be in the best hands possible. Thank you, Brittany, for making our wedding day everything we dreamed of and more!

Our guests couldn't stop raving about the ramen bar, churro station, and fries station. Each dish was more delicious than the last, adding a unique and memorable touch to our celebration. We loved the seamless experience provided by the Palm Event Center's preferred vendors. Every detail was flawlessly executed, making our wedding day stress-free and enjoyable. The online portal was a game-changer, allowing us to manage everything effortlessly. The Palm Event Center accommodated all our requests and our large guest count with ease. The entire event ran like a well-oiled machine, thanks to their impeccable organization and attention to detail. A special shoutout to our incredible coordinators, Nicole and August. They were absolute godsend, ensuring everything was on top of and that our day went off without a hitch. Their dedication and professionalism were truly remarkable.

Let me start by saying, the Palm Event Center is an absolute gem. As a bride from North Carolina planning a wedding in California, I was initially apprehensive about the cost and q...

uality of venues in the area. However, from the moment I laid eyes on the Palm Event Center, I knew it was the perfect choice. Driving up to the venue, surrounded by majestic palm trees and the newly renovated space, I was instantly captivated. The beauty of the surroundings set the stage for what would be an unforgettable experience. Our journey with the Palm Event Center continued at the tasting, where we were blown away by the delicious food. From the mouthwatering appetizers, including the Ramen Bar that was a huge hit with my East Coast family, to the delectable dinner options of steak and salmon, every bite was perfection. Our guests are still raving about the portion sizes and the incredible flavors – nobody left hungry, and that's exactly what we wanted. The open bar was another highlight, with efficient service and a bartender who left a lasting impression with their personable touch. However, the true star of the show was our Day-of Coordinator, August. From the moment we met her, she became our wedding planning savior. Organized, timely, and professional, August went above and beyond to ensure that every detail was perfect. She took the stress out of the planning process and curated the best possible experience for both us and our guests. When a planned experience didn't go as expected on the day of the wedding, August was quick to step in and make it right – a testament to her dedication and expertise. Thanks to her and the incredible team at the Palm Event Center, I can honestly say that I had my dream wedding, both in terms of aesthetics and overall experience. If you're considering the Palm Event Center for your special day, look no further. You won't find a more stunning venue or a more dedicated team to bring your vision to life.

ffordable cost. A few things made it easy to choose Palm Event as our venue: 1\. The staff! We were so thankful to work with Marlene during the initial phase of signing and to be assigned to Lexi for the planning and day of. Lexi was AMAZING! From making us feel comfortable during our zoom meetings and helping us visualize/plan the layout, she was so key to helping us make our wedding unique. She is so thorough and a great communicator. Day of went so smoothly because of Lexi (thank you again!) and even if we were behind in our timeline, she never made us feel stressed and made it all work out! 2\. Bundle packages - easier for planning since all the food and alcohol were included. PLUS the filler decorations (ie. floating candles, stands of varying sizes, barrels) were included, meaning we didn't have to buy much extra decor. 3\. Ample parking and beautiful palm trees entrance. Beautiful indoor space too post-renovation! 4\. Separate bathroom in the bridal suite AND suite large enough to fit the bridal group comfortably. Can't rave enough about the overall experience! Our guests kept complimenting us on the food too (NY grilled steak and seared salmon). Extremely happy we chose the Palm Event Center!

We even had wait staff following us around as we took some sunset photos after the ceremony with snacks and cocktails- such a thoughtful touch. The venue itself was beautiful so we didn't have to spend a ton of money on other decorations. We worked exclusively with their preferred vendors and all of them were amazing! Everyone here was fantastic, great with communication, and very professional. I highly recommend this venue if you want a beautiful, stress-free wedding!!

After consideration of many wedding venues in the Bay Area, my partner and I are very pleased with our choice of the Palm Event Center with its wonderful staff! We wanted a venue t...

hat was beautiful, accessible to our family living in the area, spacious, and could package in more support so we wouldn't have to worry too much or have to hire a wedding coordinator. The Palm Event Center delivered in all accounts above. They are a very experienced group when it comes to weddings and have their process well-templated to support couples from the beginning when viewing venues all the way through the big day. We were very pleased to have been able to work with Tammy Cheng as our coordinator, who may have been one of the only Asian American venue coordinators on their team. Tammy guided us through the planning process in great detail and we also felt very understood and supported by her given her awareness of our cultural needs of having a mixed Western/Chinese/Taiwanese/Christian wedding ceremony and reception. We will miss her so much! The team was always very responsive and communicative via email, phone call, and in-person visits. While the package can be pricey (it includes open bar, catering, venue rental, etc.), we thought it was fair considering the amount of care and experience they put into their wedding experience and we don't regret our decision at all. The venue itself is a very large and spacious one and has a number of venues that they work closely with, including Fantasy Sounds, which provides epic lighting and drapery. Given how big the ballroom is, there is a lot of space and creativity that can go into the decorations. All of our guests were wowed by the venue space and we got many compliments about the venue's food and drinks (e.g. "we were full from just the appetizers alone because it was so delicious," "I tried all their featured cocktails - they're so good"). During the tasting, all of the pork options were disappointing unfortunately, but the salmon and beef short-rib that we chose for the event were highly praised by us and our guests. We also did not find any of the cakes during the tasting to be very good either, but that could be because I grew up with Chinese sponge, fruit cakes. Some things to consider - the bridal suite/getting ready room for the women is rather small and isn't as pretty or spacious as the Casa Real's. Our photographer said it was too small to get any good shots in there, so it was a good thing we planned for most of our getting-ready photos at the Airbnb nearby. The "getting ready room" for the groomsmen isn't so much of a room, but rather the lounge corner of the ballroom. I highly recommend the Palm Event Center if you are looking for a large venue in which you want to put in more decorations for a beautiful wedding, want extra wedding planning support from a knowledgeable team and a venue that can offer more in their package including in-house catering, and need a large space to account for a larger guest count (100-300). If you are looking to cut down costs, it'll be hard to do here. We were very impressed by the Palm Event Center and are so happy that this was our venue!

ng the wedding so effortless. They were quick to respond to emails or questions and executed everything perfectly the day of. As you get closer to the wedding date, you have a venue coordinator that is extremely helpful in organizing everything for the big day. The entire staff is so nice and kind and many of our friends/family even commented after of how kind the all of the venue staff were and how organized and on-top of everything was. The venue is also absolutely gorgeous! The surrounding vineyards, lush gardens, and renewed interior are stunning and our guests had nothing but positive things to say about how beautiful the venue was. Lastly, the food was absolutely AMAZING. If you are looking for amazing food from appetizers to late night snacks for you and your guests, this is absolutely the place! They also were so kind to place all the food and drinks on our sweetheart table so that we didn't have time to spend looking for appetizers or drinks, everything was right there for us to enjoy after visiting with our guests. Because they do weddings/events all the time, everything was so flawless, which allowed us to have a beautiful, stress-free, and truly perfect wedding day. We would 10/10 recommend the Palm Event Center to anyone looking to have an amazing wedding day from start to finish!

most beautiful reception they had ever been to, due in large to how beautiful Palm Event Center is, how well-coordinated the event was, and how welcoming all the staff members were. We couldn't have done it without all of you. So we wanted to thank each of you - Nicole for helping us get started and coordinating through the details, Genevieve for walking us through our planning journey and being so detail oriented (hope everything is going well with the new little one!), and finally Lexi for being there for us the weekend of. We couldn't think of a single thing that didn't go exactly as planned, and we couldn't have done it without the PEC team.

We had our dream wedding at Palm Event on a warm, golden evening in October. The grape leaves were still green and the rose bushes were in full bloom! After finding this venue, we ...

realized later that Palm Event Center is one of the highest rated wedding venues on Yelp (via Daily Meal). Don't do anymore research if you're looking for an organized, beautiful, breath-taking venue,. We booked our wedding on a Thursday evening and from the day we put down our deposit, we were treated like royalty. Our coordinator, Genevieve, (shout-out to the most amazing person and best coordinator in the world!!), was organized, friendly, funny, kind and relatable. We met on Zoom for our check-ins, so no need to travel to Pleasanton. Then we had our FABULOUS food and wine tasting at the venue. Let me just say - all our our guests RAVED about their dishes on the day of the wedding. They couldn't say enough of how delicious, fresh, and wonderful their meal was. Then we treated our guests with a late night snack - pizza! It was truly perfect. Palm Event offers open bar, with a full well. We also designed signature cocktails and brought cases of Red Bull for our guests. Whenever we had questions, the team responded within 24 hours and were flexible about decor and desserts. All vendors have to provide insurance and we also bought couple's wedding insurance for the day of. Our rehearsal went without any hitches and Genevieve adjusted quickly and thoughtfully! She honestly made our day so enjoyable and stress-free. On the day of the wedding, there were some details that I wanted to change last minute with the decor and the team quickly adjusted to make our day perfect. I cannot recommend their team and kitchen staff enough! The best moments of our experience were high-quality service from the staff, beautifully maintained venue and winery (I mean the palm tree entrance itself is WOW), and the amazing food and drinks! Thank you Palm Event for making our wedding dreams come true.

My wife and I came across The Palm right here on The Knot. They are one of three venues that we reached out to, but after we came in for a tour, we were 100% sold. Nicole and Jasmy...

n were absolutely wonderful to work with. They are so on top of their game and made planning so much easier. We couldn't have asked for a better venue manager or day-of coordinator. Not to mention, all except for one of our vendors came from their preferred list. If you want a venue and a team that will take care of you, especially for an occasion as important as your Big Day, you will not be disappointed. Have peace of mind knowing that this is practically an all-inclusive venue with catering and a day-of coordinator. You can hold both your ceremony and reception in one place with options of indoor and/or outdoor. In-house wedding cakes are also an option. Their food, dessert, and beverages are top notch as is their service. Do not hesitate for one second to reach out to them. You will be so happy that you did.

tl;dr The Palm is a popular venue for good reason, and while it may be a little pricey, we thought it was well worth it and felt well taken care of for our wedding. We would highly...

recommend it to any people looking to get married here! My wife and I got engaged in December 2020 in the thick of the COVID pandemic and began looking for a venue in March 2021. We saw that the Palm Event Center (and its sister site, Casa Real), were very popular amongst wedding sites and decided to give it a try. The team was very responsive and we were able to book a tour relatively quickly. The tour was fantastic and it seemed that they really knew what they were doing. Because many weddings were delayed, there was very little availability, and so we had to pull the trigger on a date nearly 12 months in advance. Once we reserved the date, it was fairly smooth sailing from there. The team was very responsive and helpful in guiding us to what we needed to do. In fact, they even helped push one of our vendors when we felt like we weren't getting the right communication and support required to move forward. One great thing that is included with the package is a "day-of" wedding coordinator. Tammy Cheng was assigned to us and worked with us for several weeks before our actual wedding day. She helped get us the right information and guided a lot of our planning to make sure that we were prepared for the day. Tammy ran the rehearsal, which was the day before our wedding, and both ourselves and our pastor was so impressed. She took charge and explained exactly what we needed to do, how to do it, and when we needed to do it. The rehearsal was incredibly quick and efficient, and we felt very well prepared for the big day. Finally, on wedding day, we couldn't have asked for a better coordinator. She had everything out exactly as we wanted it, and was able to corral all of our guests for the various changes in the day (ceremony, cocktail hour, reception, extras, etc). We felt no stress during our entire day and were able to enjoy our wedding. One downside about this venue as a whole is that it is a little pricey, and there are certain vendors that are required. They have some pretty aggressive minimums for the weekend, with Saturday being the highest price. We opted to have our wedding on Sunday, and so while we did have some lower minimums, we found that many of our guests had to leave early for school/work/travel. Regardless, we would still highly recommend the Palm and Tammy Cheng to any new couples looking to get married here!

Palm Event Center is a well-ironed machine...they helped guide our timeline and provided insight whenever they could - after all, they knew their venue best and helped to make our day smooth and seamless. You can't go wrong with Palm Event Center. Thank you for making our day so amazing!

She is a true professionals and will be sure you haven't forgotten anything! The venue itself is beautiful and in my opinion requires almost nothing else brought in. The wine barrels with tea lights and uplighting that surrounded the room made the space feel romantic and intimate, the garden area is well kept and the vineyard is beautiful to look out on. Most of all the food is AMAZING. My husband and I were a bit nervous that the caterer came included with the venue as we couldn't truly test them out before signing the contract - but do not be concerned! The number of guests who came up to us to tell us it was the best food they'd ever had at a wedding cannot be understated. The team really makes you feel special throughout the entire process leading up to the wedding. There were several vendor events to help connect you with local vendors and the tasting they put on was absolutely amazing. You won't go wrong in picking the Palm Event Center!

to the area for sentimental reasons (the first winery we joined as a couple was Rubino Estates, which is the property that the Palm sits on). Once we toured the facility, we were instantly sold. Their in-house team is responsive and super easy to work with. We had the pleasure of working with Jenny for our wedding day, but got to know all the women throughout the process and you can't go wrong with any of them! The way they do their tastings is so incredible - all the couples getting married in your season come together to try everything on the menu and make their selections. It not only gives you the chance to pick your food, but you also get the hidden benefit of connecting with other couples and swapping ideas. The personalized planning sessions really help ensure you've gotten everything covered, and they're always available to answer questions. Then the actual wedding day. It could not have gone off more smoothly. The room was decorated to perfection (of course other vendors helped here as well, but it was overseen by the Palm, and could not have been more gorgeous). The food was all incredibly delicious, and all of the servers ensured it was gotten out in a timely manner. The bar staff was efficient and friendly. Everyone was just super on-it! I can't give enough rave reviews to the Palm, and truly wish I could have an exact repeat of my wedding day at minimum once a year. Highly recommend to anyone venue-hunting!

e a gorgeous room of wine barrels, candles, and uplights (which is what we chose). The customer service is the best. They gave me multiple tours, as I wanted to bring family members to see it after I toured with my fiancé. Jessica, who gave us the tour, is so sweet and helpful! She responds quickly if you email her. Jade, the manager, was also helpful, amazing and quick to respond! Any questions we had were answered right away. They are VERY organized and professional. They are strict in their vendor policies. All vendors must be approved ahead of time. It wasn't a problem though, they approved all of our vendors in a timely manner. They sent us a cute little USB drive to us in the mail (inside a wine cork) with all of the forms we had to fill out, photo examples, vendor lists, menus, etc. They also included a free wine tasting for you and your husband. The venue is pricey, but is totally worth it for what is included! We saw some really old/nasty venues that were similarly priced and less was included! 4 and a half hours of open bar is included! We did not see that at one other venue! They have a few menu options, with upgrades if you would like. They have vegetarian and vegan options as well. The couples food tasting night was amazing as well. Each of you got practically full portions of everything on the menu! So much food! They were so generous portion-wise. And the food is so good! The best I have ever had a a wedding. It was also nice to meet other couples that were getting married there. If you get married in the winter, you get lots of freebies like outdoor lighting, mulled wine and cider, free uplighting inside, etc. We were so glad to have chosen to get married in January! If you choose a weekday or a Sunday, you also get a much better price than on a Saturday. They book very quickly, so make sure you go months in advance. A year if possible! The ONLY complaint we had is they don't have a place for the groom and his groomsman to stay before the wedding. There is a room for the women to get ready which is great. They have a little lounge behind a curtain that would be great for the men, but they charge extra for that room. But this wasn't a big deal. The guys just came to the venue ready and they hung around the bar area before the wedding. The workers did a good job of keeping my fiancé from seeing me ahead of time. We also opted for the day of wedding planner that they provided and she was amazing. A life saver! Definitely worth the add on. We had Casey as our planner. Again, she was kind, professional, organized and quick to respond. After meeting with her we felt at ease. She helped us make a timeline for the day of, and she helped to make sure we kept to that timeline. She worked with the vendors on the wedding day, so we had nothing to worry about. She will help with ANYTHING you might need on the wedding day. She was very clear and informative at the rehearsal as well. I DEFINITELY recommend the Palm Event Center for your dream wedding!

We were fortunate enough to have our wedding at the Palm Event Center exactly one week ago. Hands down one of the best decisions we made during this entire wedding planning process...

. Our ceremony outside and reception space inside were picture perfect, the food (served apps, reception meals, AND late night snacks - french fry bar & pizza station) was beyond delicious and the service was top notch! We had some dietary restrictions, and PEC gladly accommodated our needs with no questions asked. Our guests are STILL raving about everything from that day. We were/still are obsessed with the entire PEC team (special shoutout to Jenny, Jade, & Jessica). They all were so patient in answering every single question we had with the most knowledgeable and helpful answers. Jenny was our day-of-coordinator and that woman can do no wrong!! Superwoman? Rockstar? Goddess? Nothing can compare. I can go on forever on how seamless she made my big day seem. All I had to do was show up and she did all the work for me. I honestly can't speak more positive words for Jenny & the PEC team. Pretty sure they are a big reason I had the most perfect day of my life.

They handle most things in-house: the venue spaces, day-of coordination, food/beverage, tables/linens/chairs/place settings, etc. It was so wonderful to have one vendor who took care of so much. I also cannot say enough about Casey, our day-of coordinator, and the Palm staff.

Every meeting had extremely clear communication; every question we threw at them had a great response. We also should stress that we did not have ONE SINGLE WORRY on our wedding day; everything ran as smoothly as we could have imagined! Every single detail was great, from the table set-up, to the food, as well as the atmosphere! This especially could not have been possible without the amazing help of Casey Hahn; she was the brains behind the operations. Casey ensured that our timeline went as planned. We also know that Casey is an extremely caring individual; she consistently reminded us to have fun and to soak it all in. Thank you so much to Casey & the Palm Event Center for helping make our marriage the best day ever. One final note, we attended eight weddings this year, and ours was regarded as “The Wedding of the Century”; this should be a testament to what an amazing venue this is and team the Palm Event Center has to offer. They will be more than capable of exceeding your expectations.

To begin with: Jade, thank you! Out of the several people that have incredibly helped us from the start, you were the first that my wife and I reached out to, and you were nothing ...

short of amazing. To those in preparation for your big day and in search of a venue... don't let it come to surprise that Palm has a wedding or two almost every week throughout the year. In our eyes, this isn't just a venue that is attached to a winery. This might as well be on it's own island as a destination wedding location. As you turn into their driveway, an abundance of palm trees serves as the grand entrance into the area. How stunning is that? Okay, let's get to the juicy stuff. A lot of vendors were involved for our September wedding. It is impossible to choose who and which were our absolute favorite. Simply put, we love them all. However though. After a few seconds of thinking it through, there is one person that really helped us to 1) calm our nerves and 2) organize all the pieces together so well. Jenny, you are our MVP (Most Valuable Planner). From major to minor details concerning anything about the wedding, you made it effortless and easy for us to plan everything and anything. There is so, SO much that we would love to thank you for and include in this review, but that would take up way too much space (and reading)! Bottom line, Jenny and the entire staff and team at Palm... there is no one word or describe to describe how truly astounding you all are. From the bartenders to the servers to those that cleaned up at the very end of the evening, you created the perfect wedding that we didn't think could be possible. The outcome went beyond what we initially envisioned and we could not have achieved any of it without each and every one of you. Ps: Jenny, remember your comment about having personalities like 12 year-old boys? It's very apparent that Karen and I acted JUST THAT during our day! Thank you everyone!!!

ound the venue on Instagram, and fell in love with its jaw dropping palm tree entry and beautiful reception room. When we came to visit the first time, right away we knew this was the place. The venue is truly stunning - from its spacious ballroom, romantic estate room with wine barrels all throughout, and the beautiful terrace area that allows you to look over the Pleasanton/Livermore vineyards, we knew this was our place. Throughout our entire planning process, we always felt completely supported by them. Jessica was our primary contact, and she made a very overwhelming event extremely manageable and executed to perfection! She thought of the smallest details I would have overlooked, and on the day of my wedding, she was so attentive, always making sure my husband and I had what we needed and more. She even took the reigns on helping my bridesmaids bustle my wedding gown in. She went above and beyond! I had very high expectations from each of my vendors for the wedding, and Palm Event Center absolutely exceeded every single one of them. If you have doubts, do not hesitate! Palm was one of the best decisions we made when it came to our wedding, and if I could do it all over again I would hands down pick them! Outstanding service, great food, stunning venue - I truly felt like a princess that day! Thank you so much Jessica, Jade and your entire team for the most amazing event. We keep receiving compliments on the venue up to this day and we owe all the credit to you! Will always recommend our future married friends to come to you. All our love, Florence & Billy.

I recently got married here in February. When my husband and I first walked into the palm we immediately fell in love with it. It was the first venue he said "wow I really like thi...

s place". Although it was out of our budget it was a no brainer that we HAD to get married here. The whole planning process was amazing!! I worked with Casey and the manager Jade. They were very responsive and helpful through out the whole process. They invite all winter couples to 1 food tasting and it was so hard for us to choose our menu because everything was delicious! To top it off my family complimented how good the food was and how full they were. You hear many stories about couples not being able to eat on their wedding day but that was not the case with us. My tummy was very happy and I was super full. What was nice is after the ceremony, they had a cart set up just for the bridal party to ensure we were able to have appetizers. The staff was very courteous they would check in with us asking if we needed anything. I remember standing at the alter taking photos and 1 staff member came up to us with a glass of water asking if we were thirsty. Can you say amazing service!! The other thing I really enjoyed is they do a vendor showcase and you are able to bring 10 guests! You get to try a lot of their items from their late night snacks and meet their preferred vendors. During the planning process we found out we were pregnant and I would be 6 months pregnant on our wedding day. We discussed postponing the wedding for another year but we decided to just go through with it. I was worried about the stress and being tired and not enjoying my self on the wedding day. I am SO glad we did not postpone. Casey is really on top of her stuff. The follow through and email reminders helped a lot. The day before the wedding I asked her a question and her response was "Have I ever let you down? Don't worry we will take care of everything" And sure enough her statement could not be more true. She did not let me down at all! She was sooo attentive on the wedding day and did everything to ensure things went smoothly with the help of Jessica. There are no words to describe how grateful I am for Casey!!! My family, friends and vendors were complimenting how great she is. Thank you to the palm for making our wedding day everything we could ever dream of!

Everything about the wedding was perfect. The PEC staff make the whole pre-wedding process easy. They make sure everything you envisioned becomes reality. I cried when I saw it all...

the day of the wedding. Jade and Casey were seriously perfect. They fixed / prevented issues the day of the wedding that I didn’t even know about until after the honeymoon (because they’re that good). The food is amazing, venue is naturally gorgeous with limited decorations, and the staff take the venue to the next level. Highly recommend!!!!

Saying you had the greatest, most effective, emotional, happy and solid wedding ever may be cliche. But for our recent wedding at Palm Event Center - not only can we say we had our...

dream wedding - but nearly all our guests were overflowing with praises about the venue, staff and how this was one of the most "epic weddings" they've ever attended. From the beginning, Nicole helped us isolate and put together the perfect package to help form the foundation for our wedding. The cost was extremely competitive and even lower than other vineyards in the Bay Area - and for the mostly all-inclusive, open bar and dining package, as well as the beautiful barrel room for the ceremony - our dollar went more than 10x farther than it would go at any other venue. As we selected vendors and completed timeline and guest counts, Jade kept things extremely well-oiled, and was quickly attentive, accurate and on the ball when it came to helping us keep things on time and organized. Throughout the actual planning, bringing together vendors, drafting up timelines and laying out the ceremony + reception, we were extremely fortunate to be paired up with Casey as our coordinator. A guardian angel doesn't even come close to saying what she did for preparing our wedding day. The day-of couldn't have gone smoother and Casey held every little detail together, kept our enormous party on schedule and stepped in to dot I's and cross T's where we would never have even thought of or remembered. The entire staff at PEC deserves all the recognition in the world for being the greatest wedding team ever.
