The Omni made an incredible first impression on us. It’s a beautiful & grand space, but there was something very comfortable about it at the same time. That’s mainly due to Jano Pa...

redes, our event coordinator. He was so welcoming & genuinely passionate about creating a special event for us. We toured two other venues, Julia Morgan & Webster Hall. While these two venues are beautiful, there weren’t nearly as caring or appreciative of our business as the Omni. The Omni made the stressful planning process enjoyable (we planned it in about 3 months!) & they were understanding when we had last minute changes & requests. They were also very flexible throughout the wedding planning. They even swapped out some of the beer in their package so they could bring in brands we liked better. Amanda Maggard is amazing. She managed the accommodations for all the guests. Many of our guests also commented on how incredible the check-in was. It was rainy that weekend, so the Omni was quick to offer complimentary umbrellas. They even gave each guest a free drink voucher at the hotel bar! Amanda also made sure I had everything I needed to be comfortable in the Presidential Suite, complete with champagne, ice buckets, & several glasses for my visitors. It’s a lovely space to take getting-ready pictures. I was originally worried the grand ballroom wasn’t going to fit our vision & was torn on using the same space for the ceremony & reception (they have another room available if you’d prefer not to do this), but it was gorgeous! The spaces felt totally unique between the ceremony & the reception. The grand ballroom really provides a blank slate to create something beautiful & it can be difficult to appreciate when it’s completely empty. The mezzanine where the cocktail hour was held is beautiful & needs no additional decorations & the dim sum buffet was a huge hit. Guests loved the reception dinner menu. We went with a plated dinner selection of sea bass, chicken, or oyster mushrooms. The crab soup was delicious & by far the most popular. The passion fruit cheesecake was exceptional, but we also offered our guests a lovely Marjolaine cake slice. Later that evening, the Presidential suite where I initially got ready was transformed into our honeymoon suite. We were greeted with chocolate covered strawberries, champagne, & two custom Omni robes with our initials embroidered on them (my new initials since I was changing my name). It was so touching that it brought tears to our eyes. The Financial District was the optimal neighborhood to host our wedding. It was very safe & picturesque. We had a several family members nervous about coming to San Francisco because of the negative media coverage, but they all fell in love with the city by the end of the weekend. I know Webster Hall wouldn’t have given us the same treatment (they didn’t seem to care if they had our business or not). Julia Morgan was wonderful, but with the Omni, we just had a feeling we’d be in the best possible hands by people who genuinely cared, & we were right. Now, we love the Omni so much that we had Valentine’s Day at Monte’s two weeks after our wedding & the hotel surprised us with dessert & champagne, as well as a card signed by their staff congratulating us on our wedding. It’s a bar we now frequent because of the quality of service, food/drinks, & of course, our wonderful memories there. The Omni was the absolute best decision of our entire wedding.

My wife and I held our wedding ceremony and reception at Omni SF in July 2017. Overall, the experience was incredible. The staff - particularly event manager, Meghan Nicholson -...

helped make it a smooth planning process and during the day of the event attended to our every need, even the ones we didn't think we had or know to ask. While our wedding was in SF, throughout the entire planning process we lived in Boston. We were fortunate enough to visit twice - once for the venue selection and again for tasting - and Meghan maintained excellent communication and coordination of our wishes and our external vendor needs. Beyond excellent ceremony and reception coordination, the Omni did a fantastic job with arranging and helping our family and friends book rooms - all led by Laura Campi, who many guests told us she made their booking process seamless, and even made some special arrangements for those with newborns or with aging needs. All venues certainly have opportunities for improvements. Two pieces that stuck out for Omni was dry fish (sea bass) for all guests who made the fish selection (the steak was amazing though!) and repetitive, unacceptable billing issues from their Credit Manager (e.g. incorrect amount on more than one occasion, billing several days before a due date as the contracted due date fell on a holiday weekend, untimely responses). Regardless of these occurrences, given the choice again we would pick Omni 10/10 times. The price was worth the result, and everyone had a great time. Our advice if you pick Omni: (1) communicate your have-tos up front, and then relax and let Meghan, Laura, and team take care of you (2) if you are organized on items on your end, no need to get a wedding planner as the Omni has you covered the weekend of your wedding (3) check your bills to ensure the contract and invoice numbers match. We will forever remember our wedding as one of the best days in our lives. Thanks to so many at Omni for making it a hit.

I recently had my wedding reception at the Omni San Francisco Hotel and let me tell you this process was amazing! The staff at the Omni made every step of the way easy and the end ...

result was an amazing wedding reception! The entire staff from the event coordinators, to the hotel staff, to the staff working the night of the reception was such a joy to be around and extremely helpful. They made sure that I had everything I needed and they all went above and beyond. I had Omni staff running around trying to find me pins for my hair at one point! After the reception the Omni had hamburgers waiting for my husband and I in our suite for a late night meal! All my out of town family thought that the hotel was absolutely beautiful and had a wonderful stay at the Omni. I would recommend this venue to anyone!

The good: The venue and location is beautiful. Very attentive leading up to the wedding. Great food. All in one package to make planning very easy. The not good: Day-of service...

was not great. Rude bartenders, unpolished service. Very stingy on alcohol. Told me (bride) it was time to get everyone out an hour early. Upscale venue, not upscale experience. I don't think they know how to run weddings well yet. definitely expected more.
