st. Everything ran so smoothly on the day of our wedding. Her knowledge and experience in the industry is vast, and I would recommend her to anyone who needs an excellent event planner. ~ I'm currently working with Anne for my wedding on 6/22/24 and I only have wonderful things to say! Anne is thoughtful, very detail oriented, and compassionate. She helps fill in the gaps when you don't know what to do, has lots of great ideas, and stays centered as plans change.
