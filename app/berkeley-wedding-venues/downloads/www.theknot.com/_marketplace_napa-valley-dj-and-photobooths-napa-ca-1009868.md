dinated. My favorite part of the wedding was the Ring Light Photo Roamer. She wandered around the cocktail hour and dance floor taking pictures of all of the guests. It was so wonderful to look back at all the footage she captured. Such a great addition to the wedding!

Choosing the right wedding DJ is no small feat, as they play a pivotal role in setting the tone for the most important day of your life. We were incredibly fortunate to have found ...

the best wedding DJ, and his performance on our special day was nothing short of extraordinary. Here's why DJ Tony Sparks deserves every star possible: From the first meeting with Tony, it was clear he was a true professional who cared deeply about making our wedding day perfect. He took the time to get to know us, our musical preferences, and our vision for the day. His personal touch made us feel like more than just clients; we felt like friends, and that connection carried through to the wedding day. One of the standout qualities of Tony was his ability to read the room and adapt to the energy of the moment. When getting everyone on their feet for the dance party, he had an uncanny knack for knowing exactly what was needed during that moment. His timing was impeccable, ensuring that the transitions between different parts of the wedding were seamless. Beyond his musical talents, Tony served as a fantastic emcee for the evening. He was charismatic, and eloquent and kept the event flowing smoothly. His equipment and setup were top-notch, with crystal-clear sound. The light ring photo booth and the lighting that he provided around the ballroom transformed our venue into a magical space. Tony's attention to detail was evident in every aspect of his setup, ensuring that the music and ambiance were perfect. Our wedding day would not have been the same without Tony, and we are eternally grateful for that. If you're looking for a wedding DJ who will exceed your expectations and make your day truly unforgettable, look no further than DJ Tony Sparks!

This is almost 1yr after our wedding (I know, so late for our vendor reviews 😬) but couldn’t recommend more! We used Tony for the photobooth and I told him we wanted Kardashian in...

spired photobooth pictures and he nailed the assignment! Were exactly what we wanted! Also, it was surprisingly hard to find a vendor just for a photobooth rental so loved that we didn’t make you bundle with other services that we or the venue already had covered! Would 10000% recommend to anyone getting married in the Napa area!

DJ Tony brought the hype to our wedding celebration and we cannot recommend him enough!! A few things we especially loved about Tony: (1) He has a fantastic online system that all...

owed us to request songs we really wanted played, kinda wanted played, and didn't want played before the wedding day. (2) Tony excellently takes our request into account, but he doesn't just play back a playlist. His experience really shows the day of because he reads the room and plays what's right at the time. For example, DJ Tony started our danefloor with some classics (e.g., Earth, Wind, Fire + Whitney) when the night was young and more of our older guests were still there. As the night when on he gradually transitioned to a bit newer music (e.g., Tiesto, Pitbull, The Killers). DJ Tony plays what is right and what keeps the energy up for everyone! (3) He is an amazing orchestrator of timeline throughout the evening. He worked seamlessly with our planner to make sure everything was on schedule AND he kept us informed before anything big was announced so that we weren't caught off guard. From first dances, to cake cutting, to speeches, he made sure we always new what was happening, but didn't have to worry about the flow of the evening (4) he beat-mixes like a boss. A song never ends with Tony...it just mixes seamlessly into the next song like you're in a Vegas club. This makes sure the dance floor neer loses momentum and (5) he had a GENIUS way of getting all our guests on the dance floor to start the night which meant our dance floor started packed and stayed packed the entire night. DJ Tony is awesome. You'll be so happy you hired him!

Tony was absolutely amazing!!! I’m a firm believer that the DJ will make or break your party and he knocked it out the park!!! We hired him for our wedding. And from the beginning ...

to end he was a joy to work with. He guided us every step of the way, from suggesting venue location to helping us with the order and planning the day of! He worked extremely well with our other vendors. The way he had our guest engage with us and then dropped the music!!! Omg it did not stop!!! All night folks partied, the music was amazing the transitioning of songs were amazing! He definitely can read a crowd. We also purchased his ring light Photobooth which was a HUGE hit!!! We cannot thank him enough!!!

DJ Tony and Napa Valley Photo Booths were both incredible to work with for our July 2018 wedding. We had been recommended to Tony and NVPB by our wedding planner who said he was th...

e "best in the west" - and she was not lying! As all of DJ Tony's reviews say, he is extremely personable, professional, and knows how to get a party started. While we did not use him for our ceremony, he seamlessly partnered with amplification for our string quartet. When the time for the reception rolled around - he made the space to check in with Jon and I - ask if there were any changes to our "plan" that we'd like to make, and led us through the evening seamlessly. He followed our directions to a T, and nailed the opportunities to fill in the blanks. I won't share them here so as to give away his secrets, but he has a few BRILLIANT tricks for getting people up and onto the dancefloor that also feel authentic and unique. I'd recommend him a million times over. On top of that, our photobooth had hilarious props, was customizable, and were very responsive and prompt in getting us our digital copies. They tracked Jon and I down to make sure we had a moment in the booth ourselves, and oversaw the rest of the evening - which allowed for some hilarious photos and great documentation of the night. You are the best! Thanks for making our party a blast.

ryone on their feet! Photobooth was also a hit; so many great pictures! On top of all of this, Tony happily came down to Livermore after our wedding had to get moved last minute from the Napa fires. And overall felt like he went above and beyond! What a super hero!

ting for us which made the reception site look really cool (~$100) and he did a gobo for us as well that reflected on the dance floor with our initials. He was easy to work with, knew exactly what he was doing and I loved that you can do everything online with him.

Tony at Closes-Cut Productions was so easy to work with, and did everything we asked him to. We gave him a list of songs we would like played throughout our dancing, and the tone ...

we wanted to set for our guests, and he executed perfectly. He put together a slideshow of past photos, as well as photos from the actual ceremony and played in during the reception. Everyone LOVED being able to see the pictures from that day, it was a big hit! Best of all, we got copies of the slideshow to take home that night, and that was the only thing keeping me from going stir crazy while I waited on the photgraphers photos! Tony was relaxed, easy to work with, and absolutely a stress free vendor! I would use definitely use him on my next big event!

ull from the first to last song (he's very flexible, you can either work with him to choose specific songs or give him genres to work with). We also had our friend MC and Tony worked with him to make it seemless, working with our coordinator to keep our MC on track with the schedule. He set up a great slide show and timed our first dance perfectly... everything was just very smooth and his pricing was reasonable and everyone was saying the music was great!!
