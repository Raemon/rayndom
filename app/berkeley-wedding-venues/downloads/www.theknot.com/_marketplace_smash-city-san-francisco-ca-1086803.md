WOW. Paul and his crew are total rockstars!!! My husband and I actually found Paul during a stressful time: our original wedding band canceled on us 2 weeks before our wedding. Pau...

l was the first person I called and just talking to him made me feel better. He is a kind and genuine person, and he accommodated us every step of the way. Even though he only had two weeks to prepare, Paul and his team absolutely killed it at our wedding! I’ve lost count of the number of guests who came up to us and told us that Smash City Band was the best live band they have ever seen. One of our groomsmen is a professional musician, and he could not stop raving about how phenomenal each member of Smash City was. He said this multiple times during the wedding night and then called us the next day to reiterate that point. Paul and his band not only saved our wedding, but they were also the reason why our wedding was so much fun and the best night ever for us and all of our guests. They were easily the highlight of our wedding, and they made us thankful that our original band canceled on us! I cannot recommend and praise Paul and Smash City enough!!!! Please hire them so I can crash your event and enjoy their performance again (haha jk about crashing your event! But I’m serious about you hiring them…)

Oh my goodness this band is AMAZING! I was so nervous about going with a band vs a DJ since my friends and I are more into clubs vs live music. That would have been the biggest mis...

take if I had gone with a DJ!! This band had my wedding dancing the entire night. And not just the young people but the ENTIRE party, people who I would have never expected to get up and dance were SO into it. Not only that but they sound amazing! Best live band I have ever heard, I was sad it was over. Music can really make or break your wedding and this band saved the day!! Smash City Band thank you it was one of the best experiences we could have asked for working with you. Go with this band you will NOT be disappointed!!!

This is the best wedding band I have ever seen. We had the great fortune of having Paul and Smash City play for our wedding and everything was amazing. From the conversations with ...

Paul to the way they kept the crowd on the dance floor, everything was PERFECT. Compliments keep coming in about the band and we could have danced all night. It is not often that the crowd is chanting "One More Song" for a wedding band - but Paul and his team made it happen! THANK YOU Smash City - you guys rocked our wedding!

A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!! I highly recommend you look no further and I seriously mean that!!! Paul, the band leader, was amazing from the start. He guided us along the journey every step o...

f the way and helped us make the perfect decisions to make our night truly spectacular. Smash City had every single person of all ages on the dance floor the entire night dancing, singing, laughing, and rocking the night away. From every single band member, to the sound crew, to Paul...they were all energetic beyond belief, engaging and interacting with all our family/friends, and crushed every single song we requested and they trough into the mix. My wife and I reflect back to our wedding day every so often and although we have many many many memories we wish we could relive, to this today we still wish we were on the dance floor with all our family/friends rocking out with Smash City!!!!

y to work with. He took control of working out all the sound details with the wedding venue so I didn't have to worry about anything except dancing the night away. And dance we did. EVERYONE at our wedding was on the dance floor the ENTIRE night. The band plays such a wide variety of music that everyone from young to old enjoys the music. The entire band is extremely talented and so full of energy. People are still talking about the music from the wedding. Smash City is fantastic and you will not regret booking them.
