If you're thinking about who to take wedding dress shopping, first of all, congratulations are in order! Shopping for your wedding dress can be one of the most exciting parts of your engagement and is a memory you'll cherish forever. But before you say yes to the dress, you'll want to rally the best support system to stand by your side. Who goes wedding dress shopping with the bride should ultimately be a trusted group of close friends and/or family members who can support you and offer trusted opinions throughout the process. [Trying on wedding dresses](https://www.theknot.com/content/top-dress-shopping-secrets) can get emotional, and you'll want to ensure you have your nearest and dearest to support you—and pop the celebratory champagne with you! Once you've decided who should come wedding dress shopping with you, the fun starts! [The Knot Vendor Marketplace](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/bridal-salons) is a great place to find bridal shops near you and schedule a [bridal appointment](https://www.theknot.com/content/questions-to-ask-bridal-consultant) if you're not sure where to start.

**In this article:** Who to Take Wedding Dress Shopping | How Many People to Bring | Invite Etiquette | Invitation Ideas

## How to Decide Who to Take Wedding Dress Shopping

"Due to personal taste, and the most valuable gown a bride will ever wear, it's important to have the right support group," offers Colleen Giresi, creative design and alterations director at [Castle Couture](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/castle-couture-manalapan-nj-637926) in Manalapan, New Jersey. While we typically say "the more the merrier," that isn't necessarily the case when it comes to deciding who to bring wedding dress shopping. Having too many guests with you may lead to clashing opinions that can cloud your judgment. 

Even the best-intentioned friends and family members may get caught up in the excitement and share an unsolicited opinion that could affect your self-esteem in a dress. A stray comment about only choosing [wedding dresses for your body type](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-dress-body-type) can alter your view on what looks best on you—which, by the way, is whatever you _feel_ the best in. The idea that you should only dress for your body type is a myth. To [avoid wedding dress regret](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-dress-regret), only bring along those who will make you feel empowered and who trust your vision for your wedding dress. At the end of the day, you are the one who has to love the dress. 

FEATURED VIDEO FROM THE KNOT

We suggest bringing a few trusted friends and/or family members who know you well and can offer helpful insight and emotional support. Carefully selecting guests who you know have your best interests in mind is so important for making sure you feel heard and uplifted during your appointment. It is important to note that you should invite the person [who is paying for the wedding dress](https://www.theknot.com/content/who-pays-for-the-wedding-dress) (if it isn't you) as a rule of thumb.

## How Many People Can You Bring Wedding Dress Shopping?

Keeping your group small ensures you can stay focused and intentional during your wedding dress shopping appointment. "Not having too many guests in an appointment is very important," Giresi shares. "Not everyone has the same taste, and there will be far too many opinions. I would limit my guests to my closest friend and three family members." Some stores may even have limitations on how many guests you can bring shopping, so it may be helpful to reach out if you're unsure. A [shy bride](https://www.theknot.com/content/shy-bride-tips) will likely feel the most comfortable with only a few guests. Some brides even prefer to go [wedding dress shopping alone](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-dress-shopping-alone) to get an idea of what they like before going back with guests. 

## Wedding Dress Shopping Etiquette: Who to Invite

Family dynamics and friendships differ, so there isn't a one-size-fits-all approach to deciding who comes wedding dress shopping with you. While we share some suggestions of who you might want to include, you know yourself best and can determine who you want to stand by your side while shopping.

### Can you go wedding dress shopping with your fiancé?

While we typically don't recommend you go wedding dress shopping with your fiancé, it ultimately comes down to a matter of personal preference. Most brides love the element of surprise that comes into play when choosing a wedding dress, which can make for an extra special first look or walk down the aisle. However, you get to make the rules for your wedding, and that includes choosing who you take wedding dress shopping. If you strongly feel that you want to include your fiancé in wedding dress shopping, then by all means invite them and make a day out of it!

### Should you go wedding dress shopping with your mom?

If you have a close relationship with your mom, you should absolutely invite her wedding dress shopping. Choosing your wedding dress can be emotional, and it's important to have a strong support system who knows you well and can help ease any nerves while shopping. Moms do know best a lot of the time, and it can be helpful to have her insight while shopping. That being said, if you're not close with your mom or don't have a mother figure in your life, this support can come from other close relationships. 

### Should you invite your mother-in-law wedding dress shopping?

While not necessary, your mother-in-law might appreciate being invited to go wedding dress shopping with you. In a heterosexual relationship, the mother-in-law will likely enjoy being included in this special day that she won't necessarily get with the groom. Giresi believes it "is always good to at least offer the choice for the future mother-in-law, starting the future off right. Especially if she has no daughters of her own."

### Do dads go wedding dress shopping?

Dads don't always go wedding dress shopping, but they can absolutely be invited if you feel strongly about having your dad's support while shopping. "If a bride wants to include her father in the choosing of her gown, that is getting more and more common," Giresi explains. 

### Do bridesmaids go wedding dress shopping?

Brides typically don't bring all of their bridesmaids wedding dress shopping simply due to space restrictions in the bridal salon. "The wedding party does not necessarily have to be part of the shopping," Giresi tells us. Depending on the size of your wedding party, you can invite a few or all of your bridesmaids to go wedding dress shopping if that's important to you. If you're limited on space—or are worried about adding in too many extra opinions—you can just bring your maid of honor and fill in the rest of the ladies afterward. 

### Can you invite someone wedding dress shopping who isn't in the bridal party?

The short answer: yes! Many brides today choose to skip a bridal party entirely, so you don't have to feel restricted to only inviting your bridal party wedding dress shopping. Who to invite wedding dress shopping is your decision, and you should choose who makes you feel best, whether they are in your bridal party or not. If you have a close aunt, friend, cousin or grandparent who you'd like by your side, then you should absolutely invite them to go wedding dress shopping with you.

## Wedding Dress Shopping Invitation Ideas

While you could send a text blast to your guests, we love the idea of going the extra mile to send cute custom invitations to go wedding dress shopping. Whether you opt for a sweet e-vite or a physical invitation, this extra step will make your guests feel so special to be included in this milestone.
