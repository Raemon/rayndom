## 1\. The Knot Registry

We've helped _over 25 million couples_ celebrate their love to date, so it's no surprise that we have one of the best wedding registries on the market, too. Please allow us just a moment to toot our own horn, because the truth is that we adore how The Knot Registry is the most customizable wedding registry out there. First, you can choose items from [our in-house registry store](https://www.theknot.com/registry/store), which makes it easy to find items you love and gets your gears turning about what registry categories to cover. Then, register for non-traditional items like [gift cards](https://www.theknot.com/registry/store/categories/experiences/gift-cards), [experiences](https://www.theknot.com/registry/store/categories/experiences/experiences) and [cash (and honeymoon!) funds](https://www.theknot.com/registry/newlywed-fund-cash-wedding-registry) all through the same platform. Lastly, add any other presents from any retailer of your choice. All will live on one central list that's easy for guests to navigate. **Set up your registry on our website or**[**all-in-one wedding planning app**](https://theknot.app.link/uFkYZsyr9Ob)**.**

  * **What you'll love:** No need to keep track of multiple retailer registries: Our comprehensive registry means when you register on sites like Amazon and Anthropologie, they'll all be aggregated in the same place on our site. You can also add cash funds if traditional gifts aren't your thing, labeled to let guests know exactly what they're contributing to. Cash funds let you register for everything from a dream honeymoon to a down-payment on a home. To finish making your registry exactly how you want it, browse personalized picks at every price point and check out our [expert-curated collections](https://www.theknot.com/registry/store/collections). And our [Registry Awards](https://www.theknot.com/registry/store/collections/registry-awards) will help you keep up on which products our editors and couples are loving and coveting, updated every year. One Redditor shares this about The Knot Registry: "We found their item selection process to be very relaxing and it was easy to go through the list, filter by category, and pick out what we needed." Lastly, [The Knot Registry Store](https://www.theknot.com/registry/store) offers a 20% postwedding discount (expired six months after the wedding) so couples can use on any unpurchased gifts from The Knot Registry Store. 
  * **What your guests will love:** It's SO easy to use. Loved ones can easily access your registry through your wedding website and check out on our safe, secure interface. To help them shop, guests are able to see which gifts you've selected as a "Top Choice." Oh, and there's free shipping and easy returns on every item from The Knot Registry Store, too.
  * **Potential downsides:** You might have to explain to guests who are used to shopping multiple old-school registries that your entire wish list is accessed through a single link.



[Start a The Knot Registry](https://www.theknot.com/registry)

## 2\. Amazon

We're all familiar with the incredible range of items available on Amazon, but did you know the site also has a great wedding registry program? Qualifying couples get a completion discount of 20% with their online wedding registry and Prime members can take advantage of additional perks, like free shipping on orders over $25.

  * **What you'll love:** Deciding where to register for your wedding is step one. Next, you need to choose what to put on your wedding registry list. Luckily, there are featured collections on the site to inspire your selection, and you can browse the most popular items people are registering for to see what other couples love. Have everything you need for now? Instead, register for an Amazon gift card you can put toward future wants and needs (think: furniture for your home reno project, tech upgrades, travel accessories and more). And if you decide after the wedding that something isn't a fit for you, Amazon offers a generous 180-day return window. 
  * **What your guests will love:** It's easy for guests to find your wedding registry on Amazon using the "find a registry" search bar. Guests can also take advantage of group gifting or financing for big-ticket items.
  * **Potential downsides:** There's a chance that products from third-party sellers may become unavailable or that prices will fluctuate, requiring you to update your wish list more often.



[Start an Amazon Registry](https://www.theknot.com/registry/amazon-registry)

## 3\. Target

Target is another popular wedding registry with some lovely benefits. We love their generous return policy (free returns for up to a year!) as well as the 15% discount on any registry gifts left over after the big day. Plus, you can create and manage your wish list online, at your local Target store or on the app.

  * **What you'll love:** What makes Target one of the best places for a wedding registry? As we mentioned, you'll have up to one year after your wedding to return any gift. There's also a 15% completion code for whatever's left on your wish list that your guests didn't purchase for you. Plus, the store offers automatic registry updates, so you can see which items have been purchased (as soon as the gift ships) and also track who gave you what and who you've sent a thank-you note to already.
  * **What your guests will love:** Target is one of the few great online wedding registries with stores nationwide, so your loved ones can more than likely find a nearby store if they want to. And guests can take advantage of in-store pickup when they buy online through your registry, too.
  * **Potential downsides:** While Target carries some of the [best wedding registry items](https://www.theknot.com/content/best-wedding-registry-ideas) on the market (including an incredible range of home goods, electronics and more to choose from), there are fewer curated collections than some other online registries.



[Start a Target Registry](https://www.theknot.com/registry/target-registry)

## 4\. Williams Sonoma

Williams Sonoma is an online and in-store registry option with an impeccable selection of cookware and kitchen appliances, so it's an especially great fit for any eager home cooks. Register online, in stores or through the Williams Sonoma app.

  * **What you'll love:** Get your wish list off to a good start by making an in-store appointment with a wedding registry specialist. Then, take advantage of curated collections, gift tracking and digital checklists on the app to support you along the way. After the wedding, Williams Sonoma offers product help, so if you can't figure out how to use that high-tech juicer you registered for, its staff can step in. And you'll get a 10% discount for completing your registry after the nuptials as well as any qualifying bonus gifts.
  * **What your guests will love:** Guests can help you get the things you really need by picking up a gift card. And since Williams Sonoma is owned by the same company that owns West Elm and Pottery Barn, gift cards you receive can be used at any of these three stores. (You can also add gifts from all three stores to one registry, giving guests plenty of options.) Plus, the store offers a price match guarantee, so if the requested fry pan is going for cheaper on another site, guests can get that lower price.
  * **Potential downsides:** Your gift list will be updated within one to two hours online, but it can take up to 48 hours for in-store purchases to be marked as purchased on your registry.



[Start a Williams Sonoma Registry](https://www.theknot.com/registry/williams-sonoma-registry)

## 5\. Crate & Barrel

If you want a wish list that encompasses every corner of your home, Crate & Barrel is one of the best wedding registry stores. The site has stylish furniture and decor as well as kitchen appliances, tableware and outdoor items. Create your registry in stores, online or with the Crate & Barrel Wedding Registry app.

  * **What you'll love:** Crate & Barrel offers engaged couples expert in-store assistance for one-on-one attention and advice. For even more inspiration, the site has curated collections and examples of real couples' registries. And if that's not enough to finish off your wish list, you can take advantage of the brand's new shared registry program with CB2 and Crate & Kids. Products from both stores can be added to your Crate & Barrel registry. The brand also provides a 15% completion discount in stores and online for up to six months after your wedding, so you can scoop up any unpurchased goods at a sweet price.
  * **What your guests will love:** Your registry will remain active for 18 months after your wedding day, so late gifters won't miss out on helping you celebrate your newlywed status (or can pick up a thoughtful first anniversary present instead). The retailer also lets guests join forces on a group gift, which is another reason Crate & Barrel is one of the top wedding registry stores.
  * **Potential downsides:** Couples seeking a less-traditional registry experience won't find experiences or unique gifts to reflect their hobbies at Crate & Barrel. Additionally, Crate & Barrel's return window is on the shorter end—you have 90 days to return things after the wedding.



[Start a Crate & Barrel Registry](https://www.theknot.com/registry/crate-and-barrel-registry)

## 6\. Pottery Barn

Thinking of revamping your living room (or bedroom or bathroom or garden)? Visit Pottery Barn in stores or online to start registering for furniture, decor, lighting and more. Get inspiration from exclusive collaborations or build your wish list using the site's "Top 100 Registry Picks" edit.

  * **What you'll love:** When you create a registry with Pottery Barn, you're given access to their team of design specialists who help you curate the exact aesthetic you're looking for, free of charge. Any gift cards you receive will also work at sister stores Williams Sonoma and West Elm. You get a postwedding discount of 10% off your registry for up to six months, too.
  * **What your guests will love:** Your loved ones can contribute to a gift card for more expensive pieces of furniture and decor. And, they can take advantage of Pottery Barn's monogram shop to make bedding, barware and more an extra-personal present.
  * **Potential downsides:** Pottery Barn products tend to have higher price ranges, so you'll want to be conscious about giving guests gift ideas at a variety of price points.



[Start a Pottery Barn Registry](https://www.theknot.com/registry/pottery-barn-registry)

## 7\. West Elm

Mid-century modern furniture, tableware and decor items for every room in the home? Yes, please. Bring your interior design vision to life with a West Elm wedding registry. You can create and manage your registry online, on the app or at a West Elm store.

  * **What you'll love:** You're able to book an appointment with an in-store design consultant to help you choose products that merge your and your fiancé's styles. There are also countless sustainable home pieces on offer that deserve a spot on your wish list. If you don't get all the must-haves on your wish list, you can scoop them up at a sweet 15% discount for up to six months after your wedding day. And don't forget to register for gift cards that are good at West Elm, Williams Sonoma and Pottery Barn.
  * **What your guests will love:** Gifting at West Elm is ultra personal. Your friends and family are able to include a custom message to be delivered with their gift.
  * **Potential downsides:** West Elm has everything you need for your home, from bed linens to wall art. That said, you won't find super-unique, personalized presents here.



[Start a West Elm Registry](https://www.theknot.com/registry/west-elm-registry)

## 8\. Traveler's Joy

Traveler's Joy is a registry service that lets you collect money for your honeymoon as opposed to traditional gifts. It's one of the best wedding registry sites for cash funds. Once you've signed up, take advantage of destination-themed collections you can instantly add to your list or individually add your preferred funds.

  * **What you'll love:** Unlike some other honeymoon registry sites, Traveler's Joy lets you book your honeymoon through whomever you'd like. You don't have to use a specific travel agent or company; instead, you get the cash to use toward your purchases. The "gifts" you ask for can be experience-based or practical. If you're going on a cruise for your honeymoon, consider adding extra excursions like scuba diving.
  * **What your guests will love:** Traveler's Joy lets you split up the cost of an item, so if your couple's massage is going to be $200, you can turn that into four affordable gifts of $50. As they browse your registry, your family and friends can read personalized notes from you and your S.O. about your travel plans.
  * **Potential downsides:** The site is free to use, though, there is a small deduction for credit card processing, which you can opt to take on or have your guests contribute.



[Start a Traveler's Joy Registry](https://www.theknot.com/registry/travelers-joy-registry)

## 9\. Anthropologie

Anthropologie believes that creating a registry can be one of the most exciting parts of the wedding planning process. Start your registry online or with the Anthropologie app.

  * **What you'll love:** To help you get started, browse curated collections of trendy cookware, soft furnishings, serveware and more. After the wedding, your registry stays open for one year and there's also a 15% completion discount for 90 days after your wedding. This retailer has some of the prettiest wedding gifts around, so you'll definitely find multiple pieces that catch your eye.
  * **What your guests will love:** The best wedding gift registries have clever features for guests, too. Your loved ones can have gifts wrapped for $4 a box. Some larger items don't apply, but Anthropologie can include a gift message for free instead.
  * **Potential downsides:** Made-to-order and customized items can't be added to your [Anthropologie wedding registry](https://www.theknot.com/content/best-anthropologie-registry-items).



[Start an Anthropologie Registry](https://www.theknot.com/registry/anthropologie-registry)

## 10\. Sur La Table

Add beautiful (and functional!) kitchen supplies to your home with a wedding registry at Sur La Table. It's easy to set up your registry online and start browsing thousands of great products. Anyone who spends their evenings creating feasts in the kitchen, this one's for you.

  * **What you'll love:** Sur La Table sets you up for registry success with a comprehensive guide to all the Sur La Table brands and products, helpful tips about equipping your kitchen and a nifty check list to help you select everything you need. Bonus: You can earn extra gifts just for registering or when certain items on your registry have been purchased. Sur La Table offers a 10% registry completion discount. 
  * **What your guests will love:** Sur La Table has stores in 24 states, allowing your loved ones to check out the items on your wish list in person before deciding on a gift. The site also has products at lots of different price points, so you can easily cater to guests with different budgets.
  * **Potential downsides:** Unique artisanal products may become unavailable between adding them to your registry and guests attempting to make a purchase.

## 11\. Bloomingdale's

If you're after high-end brands, Bloomingdale's is an ideal registry destination. And while you're at it, you can fill your closet with prewedding party attire—the department store gives discounts to registry couples for certain clothing items, including 20% off dresses and suits. Start your Bloomingdale's registry in stores or online, and manage your wish list through the store's app.

  * **What you'll love:** Bloomingdale's has consultants that focus solely on wedding registries, and they're a consistent resource while you're going through the process. The store offers completion discounts too: 20% off for the first six months after your event. And those aren't the only perks! You'll also be eligible for bonus gifts when you register for items from certain registry-favorite brands.
  * **What your guests will love:** Guests will appreciate how straightforward it is to use Bloomingdale's online registry. That said, loved ones who prefer the traditional experience of shopping in person can do so as well. Basically, your guests can have their cake and eat it too.
  * **Potential downsides:** Bloomingdale's may not be the most wallet-friendly option for your guests, but they can choose to purchase a gift card in the amount of their choosing instead.



[Start a Bloomingdale's Registry](https://www.theknot.com/registry/bloomingdales-registry)

## 12\. SPUR Experiences

Already have everything you could possibly need? SPUR is a great place to register for your wedding. You can create your registry online through the SPUR website and there are also some amazing SPUR experiences in The Knot Registry Store, if you're already registered with us.

  * **What you'll love:** You can sign up for romantic experiences in your honeymoon location or day trips and date nights closer to home, since there are experiences throughout the US as well as Mexico, the Caribbean, South America, Europe, Australia and beyond. SPUR also offers sports and concert ticketing, so you really can register for all your bucket-list experiences. Finally, 5% of your registry sales will be donated to the charity of your choosing (at no cost to you).
  * **What your guests will love:** Your registry page is highly personalized, giving guests a warmer experience (and making it easier to find, thanks to the custom URL). You can add a profile picture, a thoughtful message and the reason you selected your chosen charity. For gifts amounting to $100 or more, the cost can be split into partial units priced at 10% of the total cost.
  * **Potential downsides:** If guests have partially contributed to an experience but it hasn't been paid for in full, you have to either transfer the funds to your SPUR e-wallet or pay the remainder yourself.



[Start a SPUR Registry](https://www.theknot.com/registry/spur-experiences-registry)

## 13\. Etsy

Etsy's online marketplace is home to millions of independent sellers offering unique handmade housewares, personalized products and more. In fact, it's one of the few places you can actually register for vintage items—so if antiques are your thing, Etsy is the best online wedding registry for you. You can create and manage your gift list exclusively on the Etsy site.

  * **What you'll love:** Register for special items like handmade bowls, unique pillows, personalized wall decor, eco-friendly lighting—the list goes on. Etsy offers variety, craftsmanship and originality that you won't find at the average department store. Plus, you can take inspiration from editor-curated selections designed specifically for registering couples.
  * **What your guests will love:** Guests will love knowing that they're gifting you something truly special and, in many cases, one of a kind. They'll also appreciate supporting small businesses and artisans with your wedding gifts.
  * **Potential downsides:** Each seller has their own return policy and shipping methods, so you'll want to check each item's listing for all the details before adding it to your wish list.



[Start an Etsy Registry](https://www.theknot.com/registry/etsy-registry)

## 14\. GoFundMe

GoFundMe is one of the most recognizable crowdsourcing platforms. It's a great choice for couples who want to use their wedding as an opportunity to give back. Start your GoFundMe registry online in just a few minutes.

  * **What you'll love:** To date, GoFundMe's wedding registry program has raised over $2 million. There are thousands of charities on the site to choose from, so you're sure to find one that resonates with you both. And because of our exclusive partnership, you can easily add your charity fund to your registry on The Knot.
  * **What your guests will love:** In addition to feeling good about making a charitable donation, your guests get to learn more about you and your partner through your fundraiser. Knowing what kind of charities are important to you and reading your personal message will give them an idea of your core values.
  * **Potential downsides:** GoFundMe's wedding registry service is exclusively available through The Knot (but we won't say that's a bad thing).



[Start a GoFundMe Registry](https://www.theknot.com/registry/gofundme-registry)

## 15\. Belk

Another one of our favorite stories with wedding registry offerings? Belk! Add furniture, decor, bathroom accessories, kitchen appliances and more to your [wedding registry checklist](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-registry-checklist-essentials) at Belk. You can start your registry in store, online or using the brand's handy app.

  * **What you'll love:** Belk will help you stock your shelves with must-have housewares and appliances from tried-and-true brands like Cuisinart, KitchenAid, Wedgwood and Le Creuset. If you want to create your registry in store, the Belk app lets you scan items with your smartphone to add them to your registry. The app also has checklists to help make sure you don't forget anything.
  * **What your guests will love:** If there's a Belk store nearby, your loved ones will appreciate the convenience and versatility of being able to shop online and in stores.
  * **Potential downsides:** Belk only has physical stores in certain states (mostly the southern US), but you can always register online.



[Start a Belk Registry](https://www.theknot.com/registry/belk-registry)

## 16\. Gearys 

On the hunt for one of the best wedding registry websites that offers high-end dinnerware, accessories and home decor? Look no further than Gearys. 

  * **What you'll love:** If you and your partner love to host dinner parties and entertain then this is the best bridal registry for you. 
  * **What your guests will love:** As a gift-giver, I prefer to select items that I know the couple is going to cherish for years to come. When given the choice, I would always purchase the cut crystal over a set of towels. And Gearys is perfect for other guests who feel similarly. Guests will love being able to invest in heirloom pieces they know you'll cherish. 
  * **Potential downsides:** The return window is limited to 30 days.



[Start a Gearys Registry](https://www.gearys.com/registry)

## 17\. Macy's

Macy's is another great place to have your wedding registry if you want the traditional department store experience. You can create your Macy's registry in stores or online. Whichever you choose, enlist the help of an expert advisor (aka Celebration Consultant) to select the right items.

  * **What you'll love:** Macy's offers virtual one-on-ones with personal consultants to aid in the registry process. After you say "I do," enjoy 10–20% off the remaining items on your wish list for six months.
  * **What your guests will love:** Your guests are able to shop in stores or online, allowing them to choose their preferred option. If you opt to "go green" when creating your registry, guests can ship their gifts without wrapping paper for a more eco-friendly process.
  * **Potential downsides:** Macy's has so many products that you may get overwhelmed with the sheer amount of registry potential.



[Start a Macy's Registry](https://www.theknot.com/registry/macys-registry)

## 18\. MyRegistry

If you appreciate keeping your entire wish list on one site, MyRegistry is a [universal registry](https://www.theknot.com/content/the-knot-universal-registry) option to consider. Get started online or using the MyRegistry app, or create a store registry somewhere else, then sync it with your MyRegistry account. It's another one of the best wedding registry websites if you want to manage your wish list at home.

  * **What you'll love:** Use the MyRegistry button on your browser to add items from any website to your wish list, or sync a [number of registries](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-many-registries-should-you-have) from other sites to create a universal registry. You can choose items from any brand while also registering for cash gifts and charity donations. You can also take the MyRegistry app with you to stores and scan items directly to add them to your list. If the store doesn't have a website, snap a photo and fill in a few details about your pick.
  * **What your guests will love:** As with other universal wedding registries, your guests will appreciate the convenience of finding all of your preferred gifts in one place. They'll also have a greater variety of gifting options at lots of different price points.
  * **Potential downsides:** If you add products straight to MyRegistry (rather than registering with a store directly and then syncing your wish list), you may miss out on a completion discount.



[Start a MyRegistry Registry](https://www.myregistry.com/)

## 19\. Dillard's

Dillard's offers the typical department store wedding registry experience. If you and your partner want a traditional wedding registry store with items for every room of your home, you can't go wrong here. Register and manage your gift list online or at any Dillard's store.

  * **What you'll love:** Dillard's offers a full-service registry experience, meaning specialists are available to help you throughout the process. As you're building your wish list, enjoy beloved brands like Smeg, Ninja and Vitamix. The department store offers a 20% completion discount after your wedding (one of the highest available, FYI), but you'll have to venture into a store to use it. Plus, your registry can remain active for up to a year after your wedding. 
  * **What your guests will love:** Unlike some exclusively high-end department stores, you'll find items for lots of different budgets at Dillard's. This allows family and friends to choose presents at a cost they're comfortable with.
  * **Potential downsides:** Dillard's stores are mostly located in the South, so those in the North might have to shop solely online.



[Start a Dillard's Registry](https://www.dillards.com/registry)

## 20\. CB2

CB2 is like Crate & Barrel's more modern and urban sister. The brand has items for every room in your home, all with a stylish and chic vibe. Create and manage your CB2 gift registry online or using the app.

  * **What you'll love:** The top places to register for your wedding are convenient for both you and your guests. CB2 lets you easily share your registry through its "Share My Registry" email notification feature. Another pro? Updates to your wish list made online are reflected immediately and in-store updates take just 15 minutes to appear, reducing your risk of receiving duplicate presents. Add items from Crate & Barrel directly to your CB2 wedding gift list thanks to the brand's new shared registry program. CB2 provides a 15% registry completion discount. 
  * **What your guests will love:** You can make your registry your own by adding a photo and greeting, giving guests a more personalized experience. CB2 will help your guests by including colorful gift tissue and a personalized gift message for free. They can buy online and pick up in stores too, making last-minute shopping simple.
