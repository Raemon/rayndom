Our wedding at Estate Yountville was flawless! The Team: Lilly hosted me on my first tour and she was so informative and helpful. I knew I’d found the perfect venue after my firs...

t visit with her. My next visit was with Michele and similar to Lilly, she was so helpful, and instantly felt like our friend. The team was incredible. Their responses to my many many emails and phone calls were prompt, and they made me feel like I was the only bride they were working with. I will forever be grateful to them for their support throughout the process. Now, onto the food: The tasting was out of this world! It was a consultative tasting, we were encouraged to give feedback and make any changes we wanted to the menu. It felt great to have a say in every little detail and we were able to make it our own. The property: We hosted our welcome party at Ottimo, we got married at the Social, and danced in the Barrel Room. There are so many romantic spaces for beautiful photos: the Bridal suite was modern and gorgeous, the men took photos in the Villagio lobby, and the vineyard was a short golf cart ride away and made for phenomenal shots. Estate Yountville had everything to make our day perfect. I can’t imagine a more incredible property for our wedding. I would definitely recommend this venue. Thank you Lilly, Michele, and team!

rally every angle. We worked with Lilly and she was amazing. She was so easy to talk to and knew everything. We had a million questions and she never made us feel annoying or rushed. At our menu tasting, she went out of her way to make my mom feel really welcome, which meant a lot. On the wedding day, she drove us around the property for photos and to get to the ceremony, kept us on schedule, and was constantly making sure everything was running smoothly. During dinner, I remember watching her walk back and forth with our planners and her team making sure everything stayed on track. We always could really tell how much she cares. Another huge bonus was having hotel rooms right on site. Yes, it’s pricey, but for us it was totally worth it to not have to leave the property all weekend. The rooms were spacious, really nicely done, and I loved the bathtub. Overall, we couldn’t have asked for a better venue or a better person to help run our wedding.

We hosted our wedding at The Estate Yountville this September, and it was nothing short of perfect. It was a beautiful late-summer day, and the venue truly felt like a total escape...

. Between the stunning, flower-filled grounds and the charm of the town of Yountville, the setting was idyllic and unforgettable. Like Europe! Our guests who stayed on property had an amazing experience; from the accommodations to the overall atmosphere, everything felt elevated yet relaxed. It was exactly the kind of place where you can fully soak in the weekend and celebrate without ever wanting to leave. A huge shoutout to Lily, our venue coordinator, who was absolutely incredible in working with both me and our planner. She went above and beyond at every step, ensuring all communication was clear, timely, and seamless. Her attention to detail and calm, professional presence made the entire planning process. Our day felt effortless. 10/10 would recommend the venue. 💙

The space was gorgeous already on tis own, and with the help with my planner and vendor team, it was transformed into the most magical garden straight out of a fairytale.

Our guests are still raving about the service, cocktails, and food. It was all exceptional. The team at The Estate was such a joy to work with, tailoring everything to our vision when it came to space, catering, and drinks. No ask was too much, and they made sure every detail was perfect. We couldn't imagine a more beautiful or accommodating venue for our wedding day!

Having researched numerous and toured 10+ venues in Napa and Carmel / Big Sur, The Estate Yountville was our absolute dream place to get married, and we knew it from the minute we ...

met Lilly for our venue tour. Everything about our wedding weekend was perfect, from the gorgeous, picture-perfect venues (we chose The Pavilion and The Social) and both attentive and seamless service. The food and wine were fabulous – we had guests raving about how it was the best that they have had at a wedding, and we got numerous questions about which wines were served because they were top-tier. As a stunning resort, there was everything we could want right on property in the heart of Yountville – from hosting rehearsal dinner and welcome party at Bottega, luxurious accommodations, and of course, the best wedding celebration. In particular we also want to recognize the best events & catering team we could have asked for. Lilly is the absolute loveliest person and was so responsive and detail-oriented from the minute we met and went on our venue tour all the way to our big day (planning for nearly 1.5-2 years); she went the extra mile in every way – no question went unanswered, and no detail was too small. Also, Michele was an angel in making sure our custom menu and beverage options were perfect and that our day-of ran smoothly despite our last-minute changes to maximize guest experience and photography conditions / timing with sunset golden hour. Thank you so much to everyone at The Estate Yountville for making our dream wedding a reality!

We booked the venue over 14 months from the date of our wedding and excited to have the option of marriage in the vines with reception and cocktail hour in the beautiful Social ar...

ea. Unfortunately, approximately 2-4 weeks before our wedding, I received an email (not a call) stating our reservation had been cancelled and they’d be happy to accommodate us two days later (after the wedding). We chose the venue for a variety of reasons, one of which being to stay on property and not have transportation needs, the proximity to others staying in the area of Yountville, and lastly, the presumed elegance of a 5-star property. The director of sales, Robert, contacted me after my planner graciously stepped in to help me navigate and was terrible. His level of arrogance was ridiculous. While we can understand things happen (they essentially wanted the business from a big banking event and moved everyone who had reservations to accommodate it which is essentially a breach of contract), they lacked so much in communication and concern for the customer. My husband eventually stepped in as I was done dealing with Robert’s chauvinism, and he had the audacity to say to him that he thought they’d addressed everything and “fixed the issue” by delivering $30 bottles of Chandon and comping our stays elsewhere. While we appreciated it, they missed the point that they never asked what WE would have felt might have fixed it. It wasn’t about the money and certainly not for free Chandon (we’re actually cab fans, to try and keep it light). Michelle and Tracey were amazing and really stuck in a terrible situation; they were doing everything to try and accomodate but it was shadowed by Robert and the poor business element of The Estate. Additional poor details are that the Social doesn’t have shades so when the bright sun comes in at sunset, your guests are going to be hot. The a/c went out during the day while getting ready (it was 95 degrees) and we had to ask for fans. We had to do the same at the Social for the reception. The staff at The Vintage House were lazy, on their phones, and just didn’t seem to want to be there. One girl had her feet on the desk. When my stylist was needing to get her things down the stairs, not one of them even tried to assist her. They just kept focusing on the elevator being broken. My Poor photographer who is amazing btw (Willow and Ben) was sweating as he ran around the upstairs of the Vintage house. A few guests came to the Vintage house instead of the vineyard and they didn’t want to use a cart to take them to the ceremony, despite it being 95 degrees outside. It’s just so lacking of the small details that make the experience. Our ceremony was beautiful, our reception was fun (they didn’t save food plates for us despite me not eating it so if you do use them, make sure to ask as an fyi). To top it off, after the wedding, we received a bill for $2300 without any explanation as to what it was. When my husband asked for the invoice, the accountant said they’d made a mistake and we actually only owed $300-something with the invoice attached. It’s just such terrible business. I look back and try not to remember the drama we endured but if I had it to do over again, I would not choose them. And we certainly won’t be back.

We are truly sorry to hear that aspects of your special weekend did not meet expectations....

Please know that we take great pride in delivering exceptional events and have built a reputation as a premier wedding destination. It’s always our goal to ensure every celebration is memorable for all the right reasons. We understand that you communicated concerns with our management team prior to the wedding, and while we believed the proposed alternatives were mutually agreeable, we regret that they ultimately fell short of your hopes. Your feedback is invaluable, and we take it to heart as we continue striving to improve. On a brighter note, we’re pleased to hear that your overall experience—and your time working with Michele—was positive. She is deeply passionate about weddings and truly enjoyed being part of your journey. Please accept our sincere apologies once again. We wish you and your husband a lifetime of happiness and beautiful memories together. Warm regards, the Estate Yountville Team

ld our event there. Lilly in sales and Michelle, who leads the catering efforts, are true professionals. They also love what they do. This made the whole experience of planning as well as the actual day extra special. Expect detailed budgeting, notes, and close work with your planner (the Estate requires a planner, and this helped us a lot). We hosted our moms for a tasting about 3 months before the wedding. At this event, we were encouraged to be brutally honest to make sure everything would be perfect on the big day. It was amazing to see the "notes" come to life on the day of the wedding. The reviews from family and friends on the food and wine are off the charts. That's what we wanted - to have an event where the focus was on the food and wine. The staff was very gracious, and the number of servers was big. This allowed for service to be done in an elegant, efficient, but also slightly dramatic way, with all guests at big tables being served at exactly the same time given the number of servers. We had the ceremony and the dinner outside, while the dancing was in the Barrel Room, with bars inside and outside. It was the right choice for us so dinner could be finished and then guests could make their way to another place (a few hundred feet) with a completely different feel. We highly recommend the Estate for professionalism, ease, elegance, and perfect execution of our wedding.

ng on The Estate. I immediately fell in love & my fiance said "well if we're going to do a Napa wedding, might as well do it right and go big." Throughout the entire process, from looking at venues to deciding on menus, figuring out decorations and florals, doing food tastings and discussing the bar situation, and then of course the wedding day--the staff at The Estate were incredibly helpful, knowledgeable, and talkative. Lilly was out wedding site coordinator & her and I probably emailed 200 times between when we selected the venue and the wedding day. Michelle, who was also in charge of helping at the venue and transporting us in golf carts, was so kind and made sure we had absolutely anything we needed. When my husband & his grooms party didn't know where they were getting ready, she immediately found them an area. Joselito, our food captain, was so kind and timely. My husband & I weren't super hungry at the wedding (classic) and he boxed up our meals and had them put in our hotel room for the night. Overall the venue, the food, the drinks, the staff were all amazing and I would get married here over and over and over again.

The Estate Yountville is truly a gem and features the best of both worlds: a retreat into Napa Valley with convenience in location and amenities for all. In my opinion, the biggest...

selling point for Estate Yountville are the multiple spaces, as guests naturally move through the entire venue, and experience changing sights and spaces. First, the Pavilion is one space that actually feels like two, and is separated by a trickling fountain that runs the length of the space. The space is uniquely laid out so that ultimate customization is possible, so that weddings feel distinct and personalized. The Barrel room offers a slightly industrial vibe, and echoes the brink exterior inside with high ceilings and beautiful lighting fixtures. The Social is a modern farmhouse and is an entire experience in itself. The gorgeous interior is one of the prettiest indoor venues in the area and is a practical choice to beat the Napa Valley heat. All around are meticulously attended to gardens, trickling fountains, and convenience for guests! Ample parking, walking distance to lodging and steps away from Napa Valley's institutions like Bouchon, Ad Hoc, French Laundry. A gem for weddings and events.

The Estate Yountville is a gem of a property in the heart of the Napa Valley, tucked away in small town Yountville, CA. The beautifully manicured outdoor green space has two beauti...

ful brick stage areas that can be used as wedding ceremony sites but they are surrounded with lots of other options for welcome areas, reception as well as dinner. I've had the privilege of seeing this space decorated many different ways over the years, it can really be dressed up any which way you can envision it! Part of the property includes a new space called The Social which is a gorgeous modern barn with and outdoor bar and gathering area and a small private bridal room. This is a stunning space and can accommodate everything from casual gatherings, to corporate meetings and of course weddings. There is also an intimate space tucked away amongst the vines for elopements. I can't say enough good things about this gorgeous property!

Vanessa M. This venue is BEAUTIFUL! From the moment I started looking and wedding venues, this was the one I wanted. I remember getting a tour of the venue and thinking "This is...

the spot!" There a multiple spaces you can use for your day as well as a private bridal suite. The staff let us know that we have the whole property to our selves the entire day. It was nice to not be in the same space the whole day and keep the guests guessing where the next spot would be! The food and beverages that they provide are SO yummy. I would HIGHLY recommend this venue to anyone who is wanting a venue with multiple places and decorations already included because of all the trees and flowers planted. They also provide tables and chairs for dinner and ceremony which was a plus. They are very professional and will get the job done for you!

s, and the service throughout the night was top notch! We hired Sean Dempsey for our day of coordination, and would highly recommend using him. He was beyond professional every step of the way. We can't wait to go back and celebrate anniversaries for years to come.

I feel extremely lucky getting to say that I had my wedding on the Villagio/Vintage Estate property last week and it was absolutely incredible! Besides being completely gorgeous (b...

oth the grounds and accommodations) everyone there was extremely professional and beyond nice. Ann, Kelly and Alex in the office were more than helpful and ensured everything I could have dreamed of on my wedding day came true. The food is top notch, the surroundings cannot be beat and the people are fantastic. We will be going back every year to relive such an amazing day and visit the beautiful Villagio and friends we have made through the planning process!! I would highly recommend the Villagio to anyone who is looking for a wedding location that gives you picture perfect surroundings and a variety of options on how you can set up your big day!!

I have mixed emotions about our wedding at Vintage Estate. On one hand, the place is BEAUTIFUL and in such an ideal location, but I couldn't help be disappointed with the value and...

service in certain aspects of the planning process. When we first looked for venues, Vintage Estate laid the sales pitch on thick (sabor champagne bottle, free spa gifts, free breakfast the next day, little snacks), which did play a role in us picking it b/c we thought the attention to detail would be much higher than other spots (plus of course the actual venue and location is ideal). Once we signed on, I was disappointed with Stephanie's response time (she no longer works there). The biggest issue we had was the overall value. The wine prices were 3x what they are normally, and there were a lot of small charges that we thought were ridiculous (like charging for bags to be delivered to guest rooms). Our guest rate was $400/night, you can't deliver those bags for free? $200 for tap water for your guests before ceremony? There were some really laughable charges. They also require you to higher a wedding coordinator for the month so that's something to be aware of. Brigitte (who also no longer works there) was great during the wedding weekend helping finalizing details so it made up for some of the weird little things. My Dad was annoyed after receiving the bill since they were very disorganized sending multiple versions and recalling others but this might be due to Brigitte leaving. While I complain about some of the service and value, overall I wouldn't have changed venues. I absolutely loved my wedding. The food was even better than when we tried it during our tasting which is rare for a wedding. The waitstaff was very attentive, and our guests complimented us how beautiful the Barrel Room was. It's not a cheap place to get married, but overall if you can work through some of the disorganization and weird charges, it's well worth it. Plus they do have a vineyard where you can take photos which was a huge plus for us.
