We hired Jordan to film our elopement. We found him through a third party that ended up going bankrupt just a month or two before our wedding. Thankfully Jordan stuck with us. It w...

as our first time using a professional videogropher. Jordan brought warmth and positivity. He was easy to work with and provided great ideas and direction. He didn't even think twice when we asked him to venture down a cliff to the beach with his equipment! And the footage is so beautiful. It's high quality and better than I could have imagined. 10/10 would work with again.

rdan was a pleasure to work with. He was attentive, responsive, and genuinely cared about making our wedding day even more special. His professionalism and friendly demeanor made everyone feel comfortable, which is evident in the natural and candid shots captured. When we received our wedding film, we were completely blown away. The emotions and joy of the day were perfectly portrayed, and we found ourselves reliving every moment with tears of happiness in our eyes. The way Jordan curated the footage, paired it with music, and edited it all together created a truly cinematic masterpiece that we will treasure for a lifetime. Not only is Jordan incredibly talented as a videographer, but he is also a wonderful person to have by your side on such an important day. We wholeheartedly recommend him and his team to anyone seeking a professional, talented, and genuinely caring videographer.

Jordan was awesome to work with for our wedding in Napa. He was ready for all the moments during our special day and set up multiple cameras for the ceremony and reception speeches...

. While doing our couple videos, he made us feel relaxed and confident which made it fun and natural in our videos. His videography work was top notch and the video that was produced from a third party was amazing. He worked with a separate photographer and got along well with his creative direction, and also gave his input on how he thinks we should pose/move. I even had some questions about how to convert some of the raw footage he gave us and he was detailed in his answers. To sum up, book with Jordan, you won't regret it! Thanks for making our day that much more special!
