About this vendor

Based in Berkeley, CA, VIP Lavatory is a high-end restroom trailer rental company serving weddings and private events throughout the state of California. If your wedding is outdoors or in a remote location, restroom facilities may be a basic necessity for the big day. The team at this company believes that a basic need can be a luxurious and comfortable experience that enhances the special occasion. Couples need not worry that hiring portable toilets will result in ruining their venue's aesthetic with the well-known colorful porta-potty. At VIP Lavatory, the trailers exude welcoming privacy and cleanliness in comparison, featuring a chic interior design and minimalist theme. Contrasting white and black decors flow through the restrooms, complete with the latest technology and toilet systems. VIP Lavatory carries a selection of restroom trailers to comfortably accommodate wedding guest numbers, ranging from 200 to 500 people across 12 hours. There are three and five-stall trailers with different layouts and access doors to suit the couple's preferences. Each trailer includes private stalls, working sinks, and high-quality lighting and mirrors.
