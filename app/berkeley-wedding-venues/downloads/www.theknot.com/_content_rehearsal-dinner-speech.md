[Rehearsal dinners](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-rehearsal-basics) are a more intimate and low-key atmosphere, but still a perfect chance to show your favorite couple some love. So, we asked award-winning journalist, author, editor and publisher of _Vital Speeches of the Day_ , David Murray, for some pointers on how to rock a rehearsal dinner speech.

[READ MORE Here's Exactly Who Gives Speeches at the Wedding ](https://www.theknot.com/content/rehearsal-dinner-speeches-vs-reception-speeches)

"The great thing about a rehearsal dinner speech is that it serves a very specific purpose," says Murray, who's also the founder and executive director of the [Professional Speechwriters Association](https://prorhetoric.com/professional-speechwriters-association/). "The rehearsal dinner is the first time the two families are joining together, so the task is to unite them in a common purpose. The ideal rehearsal dinner speech should help these families understand one another and the couple's relationship in a broader context. There should be a sense of two communities merging." From basics like who gives speeches at a rehearsal dinner to the rehearsal dinner speech order, we're covering it all—plus tips on how to write one that wows and sample rehearsal dinner speeches to inspire you."

## **Rehearsal Dinner Speech FAQ**

Understanding the idea of a rehearsal dinner speech is just the beginning—there are still plenty of details to cover. From [who gives a speech](https://www.theknot.com/content/rehearsal-dinner-speeches-vs-reception-speeches) to how long it should be, here's everything you need to know about rehearsal dinner speeches.

### **Who Gives a Rehearsal Dinner Speech?**

Traditionally, the parents of the groom host the rehearsal dinner celebration, so it's customary for them to speak. However, whoever is hosting (read: paying for) this event should be given the option to give a speech, be it family members or friends. The rehearsal dinner is also a great opportunity for bridesmaids, groomsmen and any [other friends or family members](https://www.theknot.com/content/who-should-be-invited-to-rehearsal-dinner) who aren't speaking at the wedding to give a speech. And if there's time, one of our favorite [rehearsal dinner ideas](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-rehearsals-10-fun-ideas) is to open the floor up for anyone to share a few impromptu words about what they love most about the couple.

FEATURED VIDEO FROM THE KNOT

At a rehearsal dinner, the [speech order](https://www.theknot.com/content/best-time-for-speeches-at-wedding-reception) is typically as follows:

  * **Parents or father of the groom:** Since the parents or father of the groom typically pay for the rehearsal dinner, it's only fitting that they be given the first opportunity to speak and thank everyone for coming. (Keep in mind that this is different than the [father-of-the-groom speech](https://www.theknot.com/content/father-of-the-groom-speech) and [mother-of-the-groom speech](https://www.theknot.com/content/mother-of-the-groom-speech) given during the wedding reception ceremony.) However, not every wedding has a father of the groom or groom for that matter. In that case, the first speech should be given by whoever is hosting the event.
  * **Parents or father of the bride:** Similarly, not every wedding includes a bride or a father of the bride. But if it does, the [father-of-the-bride speech](https://www.theknot.com/content/father-of-the-bride-speech) would come next. This should also be on the shorter side, especially since there will be both a father and [mother-of-the-bride speech](https://www.theknot.com/content/mother-of-the-bride-speech) on the big day.
  * **Wedding party members:** After the parents have their turn, the best man, maid of honor and other wedding party members are invited to say a few words.
    * **Other family or friends of the couple:** Non-wedding party friends and family who want to wish the couple well may speak next. Unlike the parents and wedding party, guests typically won't have an opportunity to speak at the wedding itself, so if they'd like to say something publicly, this is their chance.
  * **The couple:** Last, but certainly not least, the speeches can end with the couple thanking everyone for supporting them, sharing their hopes for the big day and the future or whatever else they'd like to say to their nearest and dearest.



### **When should rehearsal dinner speeches happen?**

Rehearsal dinner speeches typically take place after the meal has been served, which allows guests to enjoy their food and drinks before the formalities begin. The exact timing may vary, but it's common for the speeches to occur towards the latter part of the evening, once everyone is settled and ready to listen.

### **How long should a rehearsal dinner speech be?**

[Rehearsal dinner etiquette](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-rehearsals-etiquette) dictates that speeches should be concise and engaging. Ideally, they should last no longer than 5-7 minutes each, as the aim is to keep the guests entertained and maintain the flow of the evening. That said, it's important to be mindful of time constraints and considerate of the other speakers and guests. If many people plan to speak, speeches should be shorter, while if only a few people give speeches, they can be slightly longer. 

## **How to Write a Rehearsal Dinner Speech**

Have you been tasked with giving a speech at a rehearsal dinner? Don't worry, we've got you covered. Follow these general guidelines to rock your speech:

### Find your kind of venue

From barns to ballrooms, discover reception venues that feel like you.

### **Start with an introduction and welcome.**

Begin with a warm introduction of yourself, including your name and relationship to the couple. Then acknowledge the significance of the occasion and expressing gratitude for being a part of it. 

### **Tell a story.**

Share personal stories and anecdotes that highlight the couple's love, their journey together, and their unique qualities. These stories should be meaningful and reflect the couple's relationship.

"It's important to remember what's happening in context–it's the continuation of the story of these two people, their families, their communities," says Murray. "Make these guests feel like this love story is part of their common story."

### **Incorporate humor.**

Inject humor and lightheartedness into the speech to engage the audience and create an enjoyable atmosphere. However, it's important to strike a balance and ensure the humor is appropriate and doesn't overshadow the sentiment.

### **Be heartfelt.**

Whatever emotions you're feeling at the time are totally natural. "It's okay to be nervous, or to get a little emotional," says Murray. Don't worry about reading off a piece of paper–you're not expected to have memorized the speech by heart. But, Murray advises against reading off your phone to err on the side of showing proper respect for the situation.

### **Give thanks.**

Express sincere appreciation and thanks to the parents, wedding party and anyone else who has contributed to the wedding planning process. You may also thank the venue, caterer and service staff if appropriate.

### **End on a positive note.**

End the speech on a high note by offering well wishes, words of advice, or a heartfelt toast to the couple's future. "Ultimately, the goal of a rehearsal dinner speech is getting up and telling the truth about this person, this couple, this union," says Murray. "It's helping everyone understand this union a little better."

## **Rehearsal Dinner Speech Examples**

Now that we've covered the basics, here are some examples of rehearsal dinner speeches to get you started. You can use these as a jumping-off point, personalizing details and adjusting as you see fit.
