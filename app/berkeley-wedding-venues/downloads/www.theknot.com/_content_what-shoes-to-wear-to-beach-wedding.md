Finding the perfect wedding shoe is all about striking a balance between style and all-day comfort—even more so when you're searching for beach wedding shoes. "The beach calls for a shoe that complements the natural terrain and your wedding dress equally," says Ashley Full, a personal stylist and co-founder of plus-size boutique [AMOUR781](https://amour781.com/). "Flat sandals are often the most popular choice for seaside brides. These aren't your average summer slides: they are elegant, structured and usually adorned with soft metallics, pearls or crystal accents. For brides who want a bit of height without sacrificing stability, espadrille wedges are a timeless solution. They add lift without the risk of heels sinking into the sand." 

Grooms and guests can have an equally hard time finding their footing, so we did the legwork for all parties involved. Whether you're planning your own [ceremony by the sea](https://www.theknot.com/content/beach-wedding-tips) or attending one as a guest, we've rounded up 40 pairs of wedding shoes for a beach wedding that will keep you comfortable without sacrificing style (and check out our complete guide to [beach wedding attire](https://www.theknot.com/content/what-to-wear-to-a-beach-wedding) to finish planning your ensemble).

FEATURED VIDEO FROM THE KNOT

One last piece of advice before we dive in: "My go-to tip for beach weddings is to bring two pairs!" Full says. "You can wear a flat for the ceremony and then change into something dressier for the reception and photos. The simple switch will allow you to be comfortable in both settings."

## Where to Buy Beach Wedding Footwear

First things first: Decide what you're looking for and, importantly, what you're looking to spend. If you're the bride or groom, you may be open to spending a bit more on the best shoes for a beach wedding, while guests may not want to splurge on a pair that might get dirty. Here are a handful of excellent spots to shop for beach wedding shoes, no matter what you're looking for. 

[**Bella Belle**](https://www.bellabelleshoes.com/)**:** As the bride, you're likely looking for an heirloom-quality shoe, and Bella Belle's handcrafted options are exactly that. But they're also comfortable, and the inventory boasts as many flats and low heels—many inspired by elements of nature—as it does high heels. 

[**Castañer**](https://castaner.com/)**:** Espadrilles are a beach wedding go-to, and the style is this brand's specialty. They even have a bridal line, complete with block heel options, shimmery raffia and styles with supportive ankle straps. 

[**DSW**](https://dsw.am3t9s.net/c/64733/315836/4837?subId1=TK-what-shoes-to-wear-to-beach-wedding&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dsw.com)**:** The famed shoe outlet has countless styles and options from a wide variety of brands, and almost entirely at accessible price points. That's a major plus for beach weddings, when shoes run the risk of getting dirty, wet or even ruined. Shop [wedding shoes for men](https://www.theknot.com/content/shoes-for-wedding-guest-men) and women here. 

[**Nisolo**](https://nisolo.com/)**:** Nisolo's whole ethos is centered around comfort and functionality of footwear, in addition to timeless design. That translates perfectly to beach wedding footwear, and one of its signature styles, the huarache, is a stellar option for both men and women. 

[**Nordstrom**](https://nordstrom.sjv.io/c/64733/1960196/23920?subId1=TK-what-shoes-to-wear-to-beach-wedding&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com)**:** From sandals to slip-ons to sneakers and platforms to lace-ups, Nordstrom's shoe department is full of beach dress shoes and beach wedding shoes for bridesmaids, guests, brides and grooms alike. There's a range of price points, too. 

[**Paul Stuart**](https://www.paulstuart.com/)**:** For grooms and guests who want to err on the dressier side of beach wedding shoes, look to labels like Paul Stuart, known for wedding-appropriate attire. Plus, "Paul Stuart has a line of beautifully crafted espadrilles that are the quintessential warm-weather slip-on," Full says. 

[**Sperry**](https://www.sperry.com/us/en_US)**:** The classic brand is known for its boat shoes—which make great beach shoes for guys—but also offers a selection of loafers and oxfords more appropriate as the [groom shoes](https://www.theknot.com/content/super-stylish-grooms-shoes) for a wedding on the beach. "They are the perfect mix of casual and dressy," Full says. 

## Beach Wedding Shoes for Brides

"Many brides love the idea of a barefoot wedding right on the sand," says bridal stylist [Maradee Wahl](https://maradeewahl.com/)—but that doesn't mean you can forgo shoes altogether: It's important to have functional [bridal footwear](https://www.theknot.com/content/best-wedding-shoes) to get you to and from the venue, as well as for the reception. Wahl recommends opting for wedges instead of traditional pumps as they offer more support on a sandy beach. Other [comfortable wedding shoes](https://www.theknot.com/content/comfortable-reception-shoes)—think block heels, sandals and flats—make excellent options, too. (Basically, steer clear of anything with a thin heel that can easily sink into the sand.)

And if you _are_ a barefoot bride, there are options for you. "Barefoot sandals have become a beautiful alternative for ceremonies held directly on the shore," Full says. "Delicate beading, lace or anklet-style adornments wrap around the feet like jewelry, creating a look that is intimate and ideal for beach boho aesthetics." Here are 10 wedding shoes for the bride to wear on the beach, all of which will pair beautifully with a [beach wedding dress](https://www.theknot.com/content/beach-wedding-dresses).

## Beach Wedding Shoes for Bridesmaids & Female Guests

**"** As a stylist, my rule of thumb for a beach wedding is: elevated, but never sinking," explains [Olivia Ivey Bannock](https://www.instagram.com/oliviaivey/), a wardrobe stylist and the founder of [Olivet](https://www.shopolivet.com/). "For women, a flat sandal is fair game, but choose something metallic or embellished—anything that feels considered. A plain flip-flop just doesn't cut it." If you like a little height, opt for espadrille wedges or a sturdy block heel (look for ones with a lower arch). And, "if you prefer a stiletto," she adds, "you could always bring a sandal just for the ceremony and switch into something prettier for photos and the reception." Here are 10 chic styles for guests and as [bridesmaid shoes](https://www.theknot.com/content/the-best-shoes-for-brides-and-bridesmaids) that will keep you above ground.

## Beach Wedding Shoes for Grooms

"For men, I recommend loafers or a dressy sandal, depending on the dress code," Full says. "Anything too formal, like a regular dress shoe, runs the risk of getting sand all over and in it. Anything too casual, like a typical rubber flip-flop, risks feeling out of place." The groom's shoe may be dressier than beach [wedding guest shoes](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-guest-shoes), but it should still feel appropriate for the casual setting.

## Men's Beach Wedding Shoes for Groomsmen & Guests

"Depending on the dress code, sandals can be a great option for men, but sandals do not mean flip-flops!" Full says. "Choose an elegant, leather sandal." Check the wedding website for dress code cues and clues, or consult directly with the couple to make sure your choice is appropriate. "Another great alternative would be a boat shoe," Full adds. "It is nautical, a slip-on and a good cross between casual and dressy for a beach wedding." Here are 10 options ranging from a chic sandal to on-theme dressed-up styles.

## How to Choose Shoes for a Wedding on the Beach

There are a few important considerations to keep in mind when choosing shoes for a beach wedding versus shoes for any other type of wedding. They should be stylish and match your attire, of course—but they also need to be comfortable and stable. 

**Stability:** First and foremost, you need your shoes to support you on sandy terrain. "You don't want to choose a shoe with a stiletto heel that will sink into the sand and run the risk of an injury," Full says. "You also don't want to choose a wedge that is too high and also causes you to sink. Something with a sturdy bottom or support that isn't too high is your best bet." A strap around the ankle can also help with stability. 

**Color:** For brides, "white shoes are more than acceptable to wear for your beach wedding," Full says, "but I would recommend you have a second pair for the photos that aren't wet and sandy." For guests, consider styles in shades of brown or beige that won't appear dirty when coated with a little sand. 

**Formality:** Beach weddings are inherently a little more casual, but they're still elevated affairs. "Guests will want to strike the right balance between appropriate for the occasion and sturdy enough to survive the sand," Full says. "You'll want to channel an understated elegance, not casual beachwear." That means flip-flops are always a no; refer to the wedding website for further dress-code cues. 

**Embellishment:** "For beach brides, my advice is to skip the embellishments, at least for the ceremony," Bannock says. "Embellished shoes might look beautiful, but they're often impractical on sand and can easily catch on delicate fabric as you walk. Instead, choose something that complements the tone of your dress and works with the setting: a chic flat, a low block heel or a classic espadrille wedge. Prioritize stability and simplicity, and save your 'wedding shoe moment' for solid ground."

**Showing Your Toes:** While Bannock normally guides brides in the direction of a closed-toe shoe ("toes peeking out under a gown can look a bit, well, odd," she says), she notes that beach weddings are the exception, as open-toe or even barefoot is appropriate for the setting. For men, though, not so much. "I'll be blunt: a suit with bare feet is a bad look—save it for the sand dunes in a fragrance ad," Bannock says. "A loafer or espadrille is a much better choice. It's clean, polished and still beach-appropriate; the energy is relaxed, but refined." (For sandal options that do work, check the lists above.)
