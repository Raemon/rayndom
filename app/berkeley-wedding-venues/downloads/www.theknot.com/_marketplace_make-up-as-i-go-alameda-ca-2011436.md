Crystal

Owner

Hi everyone! I am currently a cell and molecular biologist with a passion for beauty. I have an eye for detail and love to fuse inspiration with drive and create something that's not only beautiful but full of pure joy. My objective is to not make someone handsome or beautiful but to ENHANCE and assist in bringing to life a vision they might have for one of their most gifted days. For me, my love for medicine and beauty are not different at all. Its common ground is the opportunity for me to bring happiness. Love, Crystal

I did all of the initial set up and paperwork with Crystal (the owner), and Jordan was able to do my make up the day of my wedding, and it was beautiful. Working with Make Up As I ...

Go was really great. We started with a video consultation to go over details like the kind of look I was going for (glam with a little color), and the excitement Crystal had for make up made me excited to work with them. They were also one of the more affordable MAUs I reached out too making it an easy choice. Since I wanted to save a little money on the travel costs, I opted to do my makeup and hair trial at their location. I had done it in August for a December wedding, and by the time the wedding rolled around, I was surprised by how much detail Jordan still remembered! Working with Jordan on my wedding day was perfect. She was so professional, friendly, and fast. We had been so efficient that we finished before my photographer and videographers arrived, so we had to stage some of my getting ready photos. I absolutely loved my look, and it lasted all night!

eup, so I needed a little help figuring out what I wanted and what was realistic, and she really helped me out! We went with airbrush makeup for a more natural look, and it lasted the entire wedding and into the night without smudging or wearing off. My hair also stayed put all day, it was actually still curly the morning after! All in all, she is great to work with and did an incredible job on my hair and makeup. Could not recommend enough!

lable when I had questions before the big day and made me and my mother feel comfortable. I have never liked my hair and makeup more, and I truly felt like princess! The only downside was that we got behind schedule on the day of the wedding which made it so we had to push off some of our couples and family portraits to after the ceremony. However, everything worked out in the end, and I would definitely hire Crystal again!

ked the look. Crystal did my wife's hair and makeup for our engagement photo shoot and for our wedding. For every event she was on time. She is extremely professional and definitely knows what she is doing. She has tons of equipment including an airbrush which was impressive to me. I don't know much about makeup but I can tell when a person is passionate about their craft and that is very true about Crystal. Our photoshoot was in a hot, humid greenhouse and our wedding was in the rain, and the hair/makeup she did looked outstanding and lasted through both events! She is extremely friendly and easy to work with, and very knowledgeable. I would definitely work with her again and highly recommend her to anybody looking for this type of service.

ter this experience consider her a friend. I had pretty high expectations for my hair and makeup since to me, besides the photographer it was the most important factor for my wedding. Crystal took the time to understand what I wanted, and though I do my makeup a lot and have a specific look I try to go for, I am horrible at describing it to others or knowing quite what I wanted for my wedding. She took the time to work with photos I shared but also work with my thoughts in the moment and adjusted to all my requests until she helped deliver exactly the vision that I was hoping for. Well organized, personable, and patient and kind. Her team is also incredibly, Danica was a total sweetheart and did a wonderful job on my family.
