d-winning documentary filmmaker (which I believe she actually is!). What is most impressive is the refinement and natural beauty of her photos. She captures the authentic beauty of each moment even in her marketing images. Her wedding photos are like scenes from a feature film. They are the quality of images that you could frame and display as fine art. On top of this, Caitlin is incredibly professional, prompt, and an absolutely delightful person! She is wonderfully collaborative and has an intuitive way of capturing the essence of the people, or brand, that she is working with. I cannot recommend her highly enough.
