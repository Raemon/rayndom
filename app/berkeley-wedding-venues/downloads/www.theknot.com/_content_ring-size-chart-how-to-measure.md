## Understanding Ring Sizes

When it comes to measuring your ring size at home, you probably have a few questions. Are ring sizes universal? What metrics are ring sizes measured in? Can your ring size change over time? What should you do if you're in between ring size numbers? The TL;DR is that standard ring sizes are measured in millimeters based on the inner circumference of the ring. Just like clothing, rings are sized on a standard scale that's the same from jeweler to jeweler. 

FEATURED VIDEO FROM THE KNOT

With that said, if you've ever tried on jeans from multiple brands, you're well aware that some styles don't always fit the same way, and it's no different for rings. Various [band widths](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-engagement-ring-width) and setting designs may feel different on your finger, which is why we highly encourage you to go shopping together or even [try on engagement rings at home](https://www.theknot.com/content/virtual-engagement-ring-try-on) to be extra-confident in your purchase. 

### Are ring sizes universal? 

If you're curious to know whether ring sizes are universal, the answer ultimately depends on where you are in the world. Ring sizing becomes a little more complicated when you factor in regional variations. The US and Canada follow a numerical scale with half and quarter sizes; however, other countries may follow an alphabetical scale, which only uses whole sizes or includes a set circumference adjustment. There are also some deviations in ring size charts among jewelers regardless of location. "All the jewelers in the world go by two different metrics of sizing," says David Ryan Pomije, co-founder and CEO of [Bijoux Jewels](https://bijouxjewels.com/). "The metrics have to do with the starting point of your ring size—either on the side edge of the ring or the center of the inside of the ring. It's up to the jewelry company to decide what metrics they want to use."

### Does ring style impact ring size? 

To add one more wrench in ring sizing, the style also needs to be considered. "Some designs, like those with diamonds all the way around, cannot be sized after they're designed because it will stretch the metal holding the stones in place, causing them to fall out," says Emily Duke, creative director and design consultant of [Diamond Envy](https://www.instagram.com/diamondenvy/). Such factors are important to take into consideration when using a ring size chart at home. If you find yourself confused by the process, you can always head to a local jewelry store to ask a gemologist for help. (In fact, we highly recommend it!)

### What to do if you're in between ring sizes 

Let's say you've measured your ring size, but your finger is in between numbers. If you're unsure of [how a ring should fit](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-should-a-ring-fit), it should be so comfortable that you forget you're wearing it. That means it should fit tightly enough to stay on your finger, but not so snugly that it hurts or feels like it's squeezing too much.

But these ring dishes are a great substitute for your hand ](https://www.theknot.com/content/ring-dishes-to-shop)

It's also important to note that your ring size can change throughout the day. Your finger can fluctuate in width due to your temperature, your physical activity levels, and even your diet. It's for this reason that you might want to consider sizing up if you're in between sizes. While you don't want your [ring to spin](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-to-keep-a-ring-from-spinning) constantly, you also don't want it to become uncomfortable after a walk or when it gets hot out. 

## How to Secretly Find Your Partner's Ring Size

Wondering how to measure ring size at home without your partner knowing? You don't necessarily have to ruin a surprise proposal by asking your partner their ring size up front. Find an insider source who might have the scoop on what ring size they wear. A parent, best friend or sibling might know, or they may be able to work their magic to find out their ring size without them suspecting a thing.

"Also pay attention to the jewelry they're already wearing," Duke says. "Do they have a ring that fits on their left ring finger or even the middle finger? If so, wait for them to remove it and secretly take it to a jeweler to be sized. If they only take it off to work out or shower and you have limited access to the ring, buy a bar of soap and press the ring in to make a mold. Your jeweler should be able to use the markings to identify the correct ring size."

If your partner literally only takes off their rings to lotion their hands for five seconds, slip the ring on your finger and note exactly where it falls. Using the various ring size charts and sizers, you or a jeweler should be able to replicate the fit. If all else fails, go for a larger ring size; It's easier to [resize a ring](https://www.theknot.com/content/engagement-ring-resizing) and make it smaller than it is to go bigger.

## Where to Get Your Engagement Ring Properly Sized

There are a variety of ring sizers, ring size charts and other tools to measure your ring size at home, but if you'd rather get it done by a professional, that's absolutely an option. In fact, possibly the easiest ring sizing method of all is to skip the ring size chart and go straight to the source: a jeweler, which you can easily find near you with [The Knot Vendor Marketplace](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace).

"In a store, jewelers use a mandrel—a graduated metal wand with markers for size—to determine the size of a ring," Duke says. "We simply slip the ring on and wherever it stops tells us the size." By working directly with a jeweler, you won't need to worry about ring size charts or other methods, as they'll measure using any unique specifications they require.

If the in-person method logistically won't work, consider purchasing your own mandrel set or a plastic ring sizer to use at home with a ring size chart. "While getting sized by a jeweler is more accurate, purchasing a ring sizer online can be more convenient and won't cost too much," says Monil Kathari, founder of [Antandre](https://antandre.com/).

## How to Use Our Ring Size Chart

There are three ways you can use The Knot's printable ring size chart to measure your ring size at home. To get started, print out our ring size measurement chart and try one or all three methods to ensure your perfect fit:

### 1\. Using a piece of string 

Let's get crafty! This ring-size method requires a piece of string to find your most accurate ring size:

  * Print the ring size chart. To make sure it's printed to the actual size, choose "Scale 100" when selecting your print options.
  * Wrap a piece of string around your ring finger and cut it at the point where the ends overlap.
  * Line the string up with the ring size guide provided on the ring size chart. The one that best matches is your ring size. If the ring is between two sizes, choose the larger one.



### 2\. Using our paper ring sizer 

Next up is the paper ring size test. You can use the paper strip at the bottom of the chart like a tape measure to find your specific ring size:

  * Print our ring sizer chart, making sure that it is printed to actual size.
  * Cut out the ring sizer paper test and create a slot where marked.
  * With the numbers facing out, slip the tip of the ring sizer through the slot.
  * Place the sizer on your ring finger and carefully pull it taut to read the finger size.



### 3\. Using a ring you already have 

Head to your jewelry box and grab a ring you already have. This ring size method is based on the inside diameter measurement of a ring that fits the fourth finger of your left hand. Basically, be sure to pick out a ring that you wear on your left ring finger (or whichever you plan on wearing your engagement ring) for the most accurate sizing.

  * Print the ring size chart, making sure that it is printed to actual size.
  * Place the ring over the circles, lining up the inside edges of the ring to the circle that best matches the ring size chart. If the ring is between two sizes, choose the larger one.



While all of these at-home ring size methods are fast, convenient and free, there may be accuracy discrepancies due to printer settings or the stretch of the string. Consider using more than one ring size method for a "measure twice, cut once" approach to ring sizing. We also recommend using tools and tips provided on any jeweler's website. Some may also offer to send a free ring sizer before you make a purchase, so read the fine print to learn about your options.
