ctly what I wanted and everyone said I looked like a princess haha. It was a truly magical day and I felt so beautiful. My only reason for not giving 5 stars was that my hair straightened due to having to have my hair and makeup done at 7am because I didn't have a bridal party. My venue set the time that we could start at 2pm so I couldn't choose Contour Bridals other afternoon time of 2:30pm because I had to have my ceremony start at 3pm to give people time to arrive and get settled. I had no other choice but to have my hair and makeup done 5 hours before my ceremony. Luckily, the extensions that Taylor suggested held their curl, so my hair didn't go completely straight lol. Laura did give me some Mac powder and lip gloss to make up for the huge time gap.

re! Stylists Annie (hair) and Lupita (makeup) are ridiculously talented, kind, patient, and just all-around nice humans. They styled my mom, sister, friends, and my 90 yo grandma- who all looked and felt fabulous! They are very versatile and create a wide range of looks! They really listen to what you're going for and (in my case) also help you figure out what it is you're trying to achieve if you don't exactly know it. Contour's founder, Taylor, is lovely to chat with!!! She's so personable, genuine, caring, and fun! She was a dream to work with! I can't recommend Contour Bridal enough!!!

me I had, even with her and my MUA having babies within weeks of my wedding! I met our hairstylist Layla for my trial and immediately became friends. She is hilarious, thoughtful and such an impressive artist and mom! She helped me talk through options and ultimately find what would work with my dress and how hard I wanted to party on the big day. We made some edits the day of the wedding which provided more security and it came out perfect. She was so fun to hangout with the day of and was there as a friend during an especially emotional point. All of my bridesmaids hairstyles suited them perfectly and everyone had positive things to say about her vibe and skills. Valentina was so sweet and talented. We lucked out with how cool both our artists were. I did my make up trial for the rehearsal dinner and got the best feedback I could have asked for. I had multiple people say I needed to buy the lip combos she used (and I have). I picked Valentina because of her proven work with people of all skin tones and styles. I am SO impressed at how perfectly she did all of my girls make up to suit their complexions and personal styles, while still having us look like a cohesive group. I had multiple girls say this was their favorite professional make up they've had, one even said it was better than at her own wedding. Oops... My make up stayed perfectly through both nights even with tears and lots of dancing. It seemed almost criminal to wash it off at the end of the night. I am so grateful for this team and how lovely they made me look and feel on my wedding day.

p artist canceled just a month before my wedding, and I was in full panic mode. I reached out to Taylor hoping she might be available, and while I ended up finding someone who was closer to my venue ~2 hours away, she was incredibly kind, responsive, and supportive. She responded right away, was super proactive about connecting me with one of her artists who matched my style for a trial, and was so empathetic to the situation—even though she had no obligation to do so. That kind of character and professionalism speaks volumes. If you're looking for someone who truly cares about her clients and goes the extra mile, I can’t recommend Taylor enough. Brides, you will be in amazing hands!

I loved working with Contour on my wedding day!! HMU was honestly the vendor I was most nervous about – I’m super particular about my makeup and highly considered doing it myself...

. I am SO glad that I did not and went with Contour instead!! Jasmine was my lead artist and she absolutely crushed it. She is a true artist. I want to particularly compliment her ability to take notes and adjust. After my trial, I definitely looked beautiful but didn’t feel quite like myself. The morning of the wedding, I gave Jasmine my notes and thoughts, and without missing a beat she nailed EXACTLY what I wanted. I looked like the most perfect version of my regular makeup look. And she checked in with me as the look was coming together and made tiny tweaks and adjustments based on how it was looking so far. When all was said and done, I felt like a movie star (which was the vision!!) Plus, the morning getting ready with Contour and my girls was so fun and peaceful. (Jenn did HMU for my bridesmaids and my mom and they all looked STUNNING. Would be very confident recommending Jenn as well!) Jasmine and Jenn were so fun and positive and made us all feel so spoiled and pampered. My note to other brides would be: if you aren’t 100% positive about your preview, don’t worry! It’s called a preview for a reason – as long as you are able to figure out what tweaks you want, Jasmine will execute them to a T and you will be absolutely stunning on your wedding day. I am so happy I went with Contour and Jasmine!! Thank you for making me feel like the most beautiful bride ever!!!

Consider this your RED FLAG. Regrettably, I must share my profoundly disappointing experience with this hair and makeup vendor. This company, particularly Taylor the owner, who bo...

ldly proclaims their high standards, marred what should have been a joyous occasion – my wedding. It has taken me several months to actually let this all sink in and get over the stress of it all but I still look back with one regret on my wedding day… Contour Bridal. Despite their lofty prices and assurances of unwavering standards on their website, the reality was far from the advertised excellence. A brides makeup is 720$ in fall 2023 - (600$ plus mandatory 20% gratuity - travel or fees not included). On their website it says “during our first conversation, we will discuss the hair and makeup you’re looking for and from there you will be matched with the best artist for your style. Once deposit is received, your artist will reach out to introduce herself.” None of this happened. Two weeks prior to the wedding, stressed as I was, I had to chase them down for information(I had booked more than 6 months prior!). After minimal discourse about my dissapointment with the lack of communication given their prices the vendor abruptly quit, leaving me in a state of panic and deprived of the opportunity to assess their so-called excellence. Attempting to address the unmet promises led to further disillusionment. The real kicker? Instead of acknowledging their shortcomings, Taylor chose to sever direct communication and only engage through my wedding planner, displaying a lack of professionalism and accountability on every level. This vendor thinks they're above being accountable to the very clients who keep them in business. In the aftermath, this vendor remains a lingering source of regret. Their behavior was not only a breach of contractual obligations but a disheartening example of irresponsibility and disregard for the clients who trusted them with a significant moment in their lives. I caution others to exercise extreme caution when considering this vendor, as their actions reflect a lack of commitment and integrity to the very clients they are meant to serve that can profoundly impact your once-in-a-lifetime event. Taylor is all about pocketing high prices while doing the bare minimum. Criticism or challenges? Forget about it. If you want a spoiled vendor who only shows up when it's easy and cashes in without putting in the work, go for it. Just don't expect them to handle anything beyond smooth seas.

I cant say enough amazing words about Masara as my make up artist for my wedding in March. I thankfully found her through a friend who swore that she was the best makeup artist in ...

all Northern California. And damn, she was right!!! My makeup look was to have somewhat of a clean, dewy, natural look combined with some glam to round it out. To say I was impressed and happy is an understatement. She not only executed the exact look I was going for, she literally was a joy to work with. She was accommodating on my trial and we both vibed beautifully together. I think I showed her one look and because I am not only super indecisive but also have high standards, I just tried to trust her approach on the trial day. Well, I was elated by my trial. I honestly loved that it not only looked very natural but it felt light and fun. She worked so well with my hairstylists as well and made it very easy day of with the schedule. She grabbed some girls out of line so that we could be ready in time. I even had a bridesmaid show up super late for her appointment and she quickly delivered with stellar makeup within 20 minutes. To say I loved my trial and then be even more WOW'ed by my wedding day look was unimageable. I looked in the mirror after she finished, and tried so hard not to cry because I LOVED IT!!! She created exactly what I wanted and she made me feel calm and relaxed the whole morning. And I will say that is hard to do haha. I am beyond lucky to have found her and she was an absolute joy to work with for the most important day of my life. AND that's not it!!!! For my birthday several months later, I ended up emailing her, last minute, about the makeup products she used to help me recreate that look. She not only sent me all the products she used, but she took time out of her day to find a highly reputable makeup artist in my area, that she personally worked with, to potentially do my makeup for my birthday party (she was booked that day with another wedding). She made such a special effort and went above and beyond. Now, that/s the girl you want for your Wedding day! Contact her ASAP!

We did a trial beforehand and on the wedding day I had a couple tweaks, they both followed through making sure I was over the moon with how I looked. We also had Krista and Daejah on the day for extra hands and they both did amazing! We all felt so beautiful and can't thank the whole team enough!!

Our stylist, Tamra, did hair and makeup for me and my mom for my wedding day. We also had a trial session with her a few months before the wedding. Tamra listened to what we wanted and created a classic, timeless look for us both. She also went above and beyond and stayed late on the day of the wedding to help me put on my flower crown, which was a little late in arriving from the florist. Overall, it was wonderful working with both Taylor and Tamra.

I loved my experience with Contour Bridal. Taylor was incredibly responsive and organized, and helped me achieve my ideal timeline of not starting at the crack of Dawn :). Alisse, ...

who was our primary MUA, was truly amazing. I did a trial with her and have never been that happy with makeup and hair. She experimented with a couple different color options and landed on something that I was really happy with. I was so happy with our wedding day HMU as well. Alisse and her teammate did an amazing job with my ladies' makeup. They looked stunning but also natural, which is the look that they wanted. By the end, I was said to say goodbye to Alisse because I felt like we were friends!

I am so thankful that I found Contour, Taylor and, particularly Masara Valenzuela as my make up artist and Jacqueline Ramirez as my hair stylist. They did an amazing job not only w...

ith my makeup and hair, but also with my 7 bridesmaids with very different styles and types of hair! The first time I went in for a trial, Masara nailed it, making small adjustments as we discussed what I wanted to look like. However, the hair artist didn't quite feel like the right fit, so Taylor immediately paired me with Jacqueline and when I did a trial with her, she was so thorough, taking my hair fully down 2 or 3 times to make sure it was how I wanted it! Both were wonderfully responsive to feedback and just wanted me to feel my best on my wedding day! I would gladly recommend Contour, Masara and Jacqueline to anyone near Sonoma!

e wanted and exceeding our expectations (I have a lot of hair and can’t get over how amazing it looked and how well it held up!). Taylor is amazing at keeping track of details and coordinating for a completely stress free process (especially when it comes to taking away all stress that could possibly pop up if someone were to get sick or cancel at the last minute, she's got it all under control and will absolutely deliver). Can't recommend Contour highly enough!

Masara did my bridal and bridesmaid makeup for our May 7, 2022 wedding in St. Helena and when I say she went above and beyond. Not only did we all look fabulous and she got the sof...

t glam, boho look we were going for but we also paid her to do touch ups until the reception and I'm certain the big day wouldn't have been as beautiful, smooth sailing or fun without her there. If you want someone who will make your big day that much more special. Don't walk but run to hire her for your makeup look! She also made the coolest tik tok short of our wedding montage for ceremony, getting ready and first look. She will forever be one of our favorite, most magical parts of our wedding day and I'd recommend here 20 times over to anyone to use. Thank you Masara! For hair, Kay was amazing and got my boho style so perfect with a hair vina and elaborate braid up and down do. She also made my bridesmaid loose low bun with braids and mother in law's hair with a twist braid so beautiful. She helped me decide on look between tiara vs bridal hair vine look too and my hair stayed perfect all night long! So thankful Contour Bridal was recommended by our photographers and that we got Kay and Masara for the big day in St. Helena!

I have SO many wonderful things to say about the Contour Bridal team! Taylor was communicative and helpful throughout the entire wedding planning process, and adjusted to several c...

hanges to the timeline as the day got closer. On our big day, Jas, Tamra and Mo heckin’ DELIVERED. There was a miscommunication from the venue about where we were getting ready, so they accidentally set up in the wrong room at first and had to move later/got a late start to the day. Even so, they managed to finish ahead of schedule! When our photographer showed up, she was so impressed - she said that it’s really common for MUAH to run over, and that the Contour team’s work made her day so much smoother. On top of all that, we had a lot of different types of hair in our group, and everyone’s hair looked incredible and held up for a solid ten hours. Pretty much everyone commented that they had the best hair/makeup experience of their lives, and how incredible it was that our ‘dos lasted as long as they did. Even some of the bridesmaids’ plus ones noticed how great we all looked :)

eryone was happy with their hair and makeup- which is difficult with a large group and the team was very accommodating and gracious about people wanting to add or subtract services last minute. Marla and Massara were particularly great and I was very pleased with my wedding hair and makeup. Would absolutely recommend!

Contour Bridal did such an amazing job, and I would absolutely recommend them to anyone!! I do not wear makeup or do much with my hair, and I was really looking for a natural look ...

for my wedding, and Jasmine was so accommodating and really made me look absolutely how I'd envisioned it - she mixed lip gloss to match my natural tone and did eye makeup that was subtle but really highlighted my eyes. The products she used felt so light, I couldn't tell I was wearing makeup. Her hairstyling was also amazing, she kept the natural texture of my hair but heightened it and it looked so incredible. Both Jasmine and Taylor were so responsive even when I made multiple changes to my order and they were both so kind and friendly. Huge huge thank you to both Jasmine and Taylor for making my wedding day perfect!!

I was on the fence about booking a pricier hair and makeup artist for my wedding since my needs were relatively simple and I didn’t have a bridal party. However, I decided I wanted...

to be in the hands of a professional on my wedding day, and am very glad I used Contour! They were recommended to me by my wedding coordinator. Booking and communication were easy and reliable, and I was paired with an artist who matched my low-key tastes. I did a hair trial and she created a beautiful style that far exceeded my expectations. She was flexible and calm when we had a couple of timing snafus, too. Overall it was a great experience and I would certainly recommend booking with Contour!

a for my makeup but opted out for hair because I just wanted simple curls. Day of Masara slayed my makeup as I was expecting, it was so natural but so glam and gorgeous at the same time! Nicole did wonders to my hair that I never knew was possible. They are all great people to work with, I couldn't recommend them more!

ey would have an idea of what my vision was, and Taylor was so sweet and wonderful in her responses. She created a detailed timeline and adapted it as we added an additional person to be serviced. Taylor set us up with a wonderful team of stylists. As the bride, I worked closest with Masara and Jasmine. They did two trials for me so we could get the look exactly right. They were professional and kind and made me feel like one of their close friends! On the wedding day, Masara, Jasmine, and 2 other stylists came bright and early to my friend's home to do the hair and makeup service. They finished ahead of schedule and were very efficient. Masara went above and beyond by driving half of my bridesmaids to the venue as our transportation plans fell through!! We would work with Contour Bridal again and again and are so grateful for making us look beautiful on the big day!
