dsummer night’s dream / faerie forest wedding was absolutely stunning, and the flowers completely wowed us and our guests. Beyond her talent, Lana was such a joy to work with—kind, thoughtful, and genuinely invested in making our day perfect. She also did an amazing job keeping us within budget by using in-season flowers, smart fillers, and repurposing pieces throughout the night, without sacrificing our vision. As a bonus, she even donated our flowers after the wedding so nothing went to waste. We couldn’t have asked for a better experience!

team prioritizes her clients. Selecting a florist for our wedding was the hardest part and Lana truly helped by asking details and providing professional recommendations within our budget. For our wedding, we asked if it was possible to take flower to SF city hall and then to take it to our flowers to our reception hall - LANA DELIVERED! Made it so easy for us without any worries. In fact, they also delivered our bouquets and boutonnières to our hotels before our ceremony. THIS IS WHAT I CALL ABOVE AND BEYOND SERVICES ! Thank you for making my wedding so memorable! The flowers were so beautiful and my families loved taking them home after our reception. We do not have our pictures yet to provide an example BUT TRUST ME THEY WERE GORGEOUS!!!! BEST PRICES TOO!

She is a strong advocate in her clients’ dream wedding! It was also their first time doing ceiling installation at my venue and despite some challenges along the way, they even exceeded my expectations. I never had any doubt in Lana and their team; I had full faith in their work and they did not disappoint! Lana was one of my top favorite wedding vendors to work with and she made the journey fun! L

The flowers were beyond my expectations when I saw them on the day. And even now, months later, when people see the photos the first thing they comment on are the flowers - they are surreal. I highly recommend Lana for your wedding needs - she understands and translates your vision, is very competitively priced, and has a fabulous eye. And so diligent!

Lana and the Dream Flowers Team made my wife’s and my wedding dreams a reality! We contacted Lana about 16 months before our wedding day because we were so impressed by her detail...

ed oriented work that was showcased on her and our venue’s Instagram. Our first conversation with Lana was very welcoming and her planning process made my wife and I comfortable enough to express what we truly wanted for our wedding without feeling judged. No matter what idea we suggested to Lana, she never made us feel like it was impossible or that the idea was a bad one, which we appreciated. Additionally, she also was very transparent with how much each item we wanted would cost while also being aware of our budget. Throughout the wedding planning process, we contacted Lana many times to make changes, ask questions, and clarify logistics and she was always able to make time for us despite her busy schedule all the way until the special day. The wedding day was the first time we met Lana in person and we immediately felt as if she was a long-time friend. While the bridal party was getting ready, Lana was very patient and friendly while trying to pin over 14 Boutonnieres for me, the groomsmen, and parents; 3 corsages for the mothers, and 10 bouquets for the bride, MOH, and bridesmaids. She also made sure flowers were added to the cake once it was delivered to the venue hours before the start of the ceremony and that each floral arrangement we used at our ceremony was able to be transported and repurposed at the reception to avoid waste. One particular memory that stood out to me was while Lana was finishing up the flowers at the venue – she saw from afar that my boutonniere was slightly flattened from hugging family and friends during pictures and without hesitation pinned a new boutonniere on me which showed how much Lana cared about her clients and every detail of our wedding. Another example that showed how much Lana cared about us and our wedding was something we witnessed just before our ceremony – although Lana was done with all of the floral arrangements she spent some time documenting her unique behind-the-scenes POV of our wedding which we were honored to see on her social media. The floral arrangements at our wedding were truly amazing and many of our family and friends could not stop talking about them even 6 months after our wedding has passed! Some of the specific asks that Lana did an exceptional job on include: Flower arch, wedding Cake flower décor, welcome table flowers, Acrylic floral vases, various candles at the altar and sweetheart table, a variety of center pieces throughout the venue, ceremony flower petals and more! Overall, Lana was amazing to work with. She was very generous and gracious with the amount of high-quality beautiful flowers she provided, she was easy to communicate with, and her curation of flower to match our vision was perfect! If you are looking for a reliable, understanding, and caring florist who will strive to go above and beyond for your wedding, then Lana and Dream Flowers are the right floral vendor for you!

details and for the flowers I was so sure about she gave us great suggestions on how our set up should look. Overall, our flowers and centerpieces turned out great! We got so many compliments on them from our guests! Lana even told us we can have our guests take them home, which they did! She even came to our wedding venue after hours (past midnight) and made sure we didn’t have to worry about cleaning up afterwards. It was a super smooth process. I highly recommend Lana and her crew for your next wedding!

omplish my vision. We based my design on a color palette and a love for flowers, and Lana accomplished just that and more! All of our florals were a dream come true, they truly took my breath away when I saw them for the first time. From bouquets to centerpieces, to church pieces, everything was beautiful and perfect! She moved the flowers from the church to the reception so we could continue to use them throughout the night, even changing the vase from gold to silver to match our colors in the venue! In addition, when we had a cake fiasco (vendor forgot to bake and bring our cake), Lana was ready for the new cake to arrive later in the night to place our flowers on top. If you are looking for a passionate, professional, and extremely talented florist, look no further!!

s through multiple wedding venues. Over the course of the year we had several phone calls discussing the vision I had and what I had wanted for my wedding. Me being so indecisive, I kept changing what I wanted everytime I saw a new wedding. Lana was so kind and understanding with me regarding all these changes and I really appreciated her patience with me! I think I had changed a lot of the things I had wanted up until maybe the last month before the wedding. The day of, me and my partner were BLOWN AWAY by all the florals. The vision we had discussed had come to life and she executed it PERFECTLY! Multiple guests at my wedding complimented the floral decor and her and her teams work was stunning! I could not be more happy with how everything turned out. She even came up to me and my bridal party to snip away any wilting flowers (it was a very hot day) throughout the day. I could not recommend her enough to everyone and am glad I went with her. Lana and her team are the best!!

I'm so grateful for all the beautiful work the DreamFlowers team did for our wedding. The flowers were so fresh and beautiful, and the arrangements were so grand and full! I can't pick just one favorite thing - we loved the arbor florals, centerpieces and sweetheart table florals. I highly recommend selecting DreamFlowers as your event vendor. Trust me, you won't be disappointed.

We have nothing but amazing things to say about Lana. She started with a phone call to learn about what we were looking for. Next, she made a google doc and started finding stock ...

photos of others to make sure we were all on the same page. "this kind of shape, but that kind of color..." this made it really clear, it was an easy way for us to communicate visually about what we were trying to achieve. She offered many of her own great ideas, but also listened carefully and took all the changes we asked. She agreed to make individual place cards for each guest, each mounted on a potted succulent. They were a big hit and all the guests took their plant home. On the day of the wedding she and her team executed beautifully. They followed the Google doc to the letter. They set up a chuppah with amazing floral and succulent arrangements on it. Table centerpieces were on point exactly as discussed. We love you Lana! If we were getting married again we'd hire you.

She was quick to hone in the look we were going for and was very accommodating to our budget while maintaining keeping the wedding beautiful. On day of our wedding, Lana even went out of her way to come and help put on our boutonnieres which something I heard not all florist would do. At the reception, Lana actually stayed the whole time from beginning to end of the reception, to ensure all florals worked out. Our wedding turned out beautiful with the help of Lana. HIGHLY recommended!

tter than what I pictured in my head, with a great variety of flower types. She was incredibly accommodating with quantity changes due to COVID (this was in 2021) and also managed to find the exact centerpiece vases we wanted despite product shortages (again due to COVID). When one of the flowers in my bouquet came loose during the photographers Lana's assistant (whose name I unfortunately didn't catch) immediately helped fix it and fill the hole in the bouquet. Dream Flowers also did the florals for another wedding I'd been in and did a beautiful job with an entirely different aesthetic. I could not provide a higher recommendation for this team regardless of the style you are looking for, they will do a professional and flawless job.

She even made a long drive to my venue a couple months before the wedding to make sure the setup would be perfect the day of, and it truly was. Lana and her team went above and beyond, from the outside floral arch to the floral centerpieces, the bouquets and everything else they touched. I got so many compliments.

ith her your dream, she'll ask for example photos which can easily be taken from Pinterest or instagram. You can even peak at her previous work to guide her too. She'll add these images to a living contract so that you both can keep track of your vision and make edits where needed. I had two calls with her, one of which was 2-3 weeks before the wedding to confirm details (and change the plan entirely – sorry!). This was helpful because she doesn't purchase the flowers until a little before your date to ensure freshness. After paying the deposit and double/triple checking the contract amount, I thought, no way could she be charging me so little! I was so shocked because on the day of, I received the biggest surprise. Lana and her team went big! She provided an amazing arch, the dreamiest reception flowers on the tables and my sweetheart table, and the most beautiful bouquets. Dream Flowers is experienced in both large installments for corporate events and luxury weddings, but she also has the patience and attention to detail for smaller events too. Lana can do modern classic bouquets, boho chic bouquets, and, for my wedding, bright and colorful. Please hire Dream Flowers if you can. It was one of the best decisions I ever made.

Lana was absolutely amazing! First, I loved how easy it was to work with Lana for my wedding. She set up a google doc and we were able to both pull it up and share pictures, and ...

stay on the same page about planning for my vision over the phone. She was very straightforward with her pricing and helped me figure out exactly what needed to get my vision to come true! We started off with less flowers and then ended up cancelling a different piece of decor and opting for more flowers. Lana was able to set up a big circular backdrop for our sweetheart table and hung my neon sign that I had purchased and made it into a beautiful showstopper piece! I also really wanted long tables but was worried about the cost of garland vs smaller centerpieces for round tables. Lana was able to work within my budget and still created STUNNING garlands. Every single thing we asked for was bigger and more beautiful than we imagined. My mom cried when she walked into the ceremony space because the flowers were just so beautiful!! Lana also did an unseen and amazing job shifting elements around, from the aisle markers to the cocktail table centerpieces, and the ceremony flowers to the sweetheart table, she reused our florals like a pro and it was totally unnoticed, smooth and quick! She also totally embraced the style I asked for perfectly! I'm so impressed with Lana and she brought our floral dreams to life!! :D

Working with Lana at Dream Flowers was truly an amazing experience—-from her first class customer service—always responding to emails, texts and phone calls....she also took the ti...

me to meet before the event and go over every single detail.... I remember saying before the wedding took place to the mother of the groom how wonderful it had been working with Lana and how I trusted she would do a good job and she absolutely did not disappoint.... and when I walked into the Palm Event Center and saw what she did to make our vision come to life was truly enchanting whimsical and magical—it looked better than I could have imagined—-there was nothing that was not absolutely perfect....she is truly the sweetest and kindest florist and it was such a pleasure working with her. I would also like to mention that she is very reasonable with her prices which is truly appreciated and we brought a ton of the florals home and they lasted at least a week which was such an added bonus to have so many beautiful florals in our home for so long after the wedding! From the bottom of our hearts—-thank you Lana/-you are the best at what you do! :)

We’re grateful for having Lana be our florist for our wedding. All the floral work was beyond our expectations. Having Lana as our florist made the process very easy for us. We dis...

cussed our vision by filling a form and providing pictures we liked. She helped us fill in all little details when we spoke with her. The result was even more beautiful than what we had imagined! (Our only regret during our wedding was not having more time to enjoy the floral arrangements that we loved so much.) Lana picked out the perfect colors to match our wedding palette and incorporated succulents that we like. We received many compliments from our guests. One of the guests even mentioned that it was the most beautiful floral work she had seen. We wish we could have another big party so that we can hire Lana again. ; ) Thank you for everything, Lana & Dream Flowers!
