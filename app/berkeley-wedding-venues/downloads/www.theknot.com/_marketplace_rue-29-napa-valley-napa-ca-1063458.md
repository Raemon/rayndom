I worked with Janice at Rue 29 to plan my husband’s 40th birthday dinner, and I cannot recommend her highly enough. From start to finish, she was incredibly detail-oriented and tho...

ughtful, always coming to the table with smart suggestions that elevated the evening and made the guest experience so much more special. Communication with Janice was a dream—she is responsive, organized, and on top of every detail. All the vendors worked together seamlessly, which speaks volumes about both her planning skills and her professionalism. Janice is also extremely well-connected and has relationships with the most talented vendors—musicians, cake designers, calligraphers, florists, and more. She curated a team that worked beautifully together and truly brought the event to life. Above all, Janice is incredibly thoughtful—she thinks of everything and goes out of her way to help in any way possible. One of the things I also appreciated most was how budget-conscious Janice was—she focused on getting true value and never suggested spending money where it didn’t make sense. That gave me a lot of confidence in every decision we made together. Thanks to her, we had an unforgettable celebration that felt effortless for us as hosts. If you are looking for someone who will treat your event as if it were her own, and who has the talent, connections, and dedication to deliver an extraordinary experience, Janice is the one. Rue 29 is simply exceptional! Thank you Janice and Rue 29 for an event to remember!

Janice was amazing, she is everything you want in a planner: extremely detailed, very knowledgeable of the local vendors, and treats her couples like family! She worked tirelessly ...

to make sure we could relax and enjoy our wedding day (and we did) - not a single detail went unnoticed and our guests were raving about how much fun they had. Our venue recommended Janice and we are so glad they did! The most common feedback we heard from other vendors was “Janice will make sure everything is amazing” and she truly did. This is the most important vendor you’ll hire for your wedding, they can make or break it, and we are so glad to have found Janice!

ied in Napa Valley, please look no further than Janice and Rue 29 Napa Valley. From the very first phone call with Janice, I knew we would be in great hands due to her exceptional professionalism, dedication to detail, and genuine kindness. It was also very important to us to work with someone who was local to Napa Valley, as it would be a first-time visit for nearly all of our guests and we wanted to provide recommendations from someone who really knew the area. Janice, a Napa local for decades, provided recommendations for guest accommodations, restaurants, local vendors, and even graciously utilized several of her personal contacts in the area to provide the best experiences for us and our guests over our wedding weekend. Janice was also quick to answer all of our [abundant] logistical questions, and advised us on details ranging from timing of reception toasts, to processional order, to where/when to bustle my dress (a process!), and so much more. Janice made us feel so at peace knowing that every detail was considered and planned for, and we were able to enjoy every aspect of our wedding day because of Janice’s coordination and expert ability to keep everything together. Janice is not only an amazing wedding coordinator but also a wonderful person, and I cherished getting to know throughout the planning process—I look forward to staying connected with Janice for years to come and could not have asked for a better partner in the planning process.

When my wife decided to plan a wedding in 3 months, I was skeptical that we would be able to get things done in time. Janice was there with us throughout the process, and with her ...

undying enthusiasm and expert guidance, we were able to pull off our dream wedding. Janice took the time to really understand what we wanted, and made sure to keep us, and our vendors, on schedule. She handled all the coordination, and made sure everything was in place, so that we could enjoy our day without a single worry. She even showed up to our venue walkthrough, even though she had recently had an injury, which speaks to her dedication to her clients. We really couldn’t have been more happy to have worked with Janice and Rue 29.

My husband and I worked with Janice for our October 2023 wedding in Saint Helena, CA. We live in Arizona so this was a destination wedding. Janice made every aspect of our wedding ...

planning process so easy. We did not have a lot of wedding planning process knowledge and Janice was there to advise and suggest every step of the way. Every suggestion she made was spot-on and made our day spectacular. I do not think we could have hired anyone more knowledgeable, detail oriented, and responsive than Janice. Our wedding day was a dream, and we were able to fully enjoy our day because Janice coordinated everything so perfectly. Janice made it her mission to ensure that our vision of our wedding was made a reality. We cannot thank Janice and her team enough for making our day so special. We highly recommend Janice for wedding planning/management, and frankly if you are not working with Janice for your wedding or event you are severely missing out.

Janice was our dream wedding planner come true! The thought of planning a wedding in California from Texas while working full time and being a full time student was overwhelming, a...

nd as soon as I spoke to Janice, I felt at ease. She is extremely detail oriented, thoughtful, and follows through extraordinarily quickly on the many to-dos of planning -- no waiting for a response or following up with Janice; she's on top of it and reminding me to take care of my own to-dos (exactly what I needed!). She was flexible and understanding on things I felt strongly about and took the lead to make recommendations on things I didn't have a strong perspective on. When a record heat wave hit Napa the day before our wedding, Janice seamlessly connected with every single vendor to move our ceremony & reception times back 1 hr to allow for the temperatures to drop in seemingly light speed time - I didn't even have time to worry before she had solved it all! Everything about our wedding was as or better than we hoped and I can't imagine it without Janice!

Planning a destination wedding certainly has its challenges, but when I met Janice, Owner of Rue 29 in Napa at the venue, I knew my daughter and her fiance were in good hands!! Fro...

m the moment we met, I could see that Janice had the experience and knowledge necessary to create a seamless event -- and that she certainly did. She was able to answer our questions and/or concerns quickly and with certainty to put our minds at ease -- and we were thousands of miles away from the venue. In addition, Janice has a personality that is a pleasure to be around and work with; she is a good listener and does an excellent job understanding the wishes of the bride and groom and bringing their dreams to reality. By the time the weekend of the event rolled around, and as the Mother of the Bride, I had not a care in the world knowing that Janice had orchestrated and coordinated everything I could possibly have thought of (and beyond) seamlessly. On the day of the event, I was in awe of the beauty and elegance that was displayed at the event through the vendors that Janice recommended and coordinated. When someone is in busines as long as Janice has been as a wedding planner, there is no doubt that she moves through the process with ease and confidence and certainly removes any concerns about food, timing, vendors, etc. Thank you Janice!!! Your hard work, caring and excellent expertise behind the scenes helped to make my daughter's wedding day magical. I highly recommend Janice Twomey, owner/operator of Rue 29!!

t vendor recommendations and relationships. She was incredibly helpful and responsive to all of our questions from our first phone conversation up until our big day. Janice was detail oriented and thorough, great at handling unexpected situations (like when our hair and make up person tested positive for COVID the day before the wedding, or when I spilled all down the front of my dress at the reception), and is also just a really kind and lovely person to partner with. We loved everything about our big day (including the lavender she brought us from her home!) and are so thankful to Janice for her guidance and help.

mental in achieving the perfect rehearsal dinner for our 90 guests. I live 2,500 miles away from Napa and she instilled in me the utmost confidence that we would achieve a shared vision for my event - from selecting the venue, to flowers, transportation, menu and wines, Janice's recommendations were all spot on. She understood what I wanted and worked diligently to make my vision complete. I trusted Janice completely! I would highly recommend her to anyone wanting to plan the perfect event.

our wedding not once but twice due to COVID and Janice kept in touch with us for the last year and a half as we watched and waited to see how the COVID situation would pan out. Janice is extremely organized, punctual and thorough. She made sure we confirmed and approved every detail of the wedding to ensure the day went as smoothly as possible. She was great at making sure all the vendors arrived on time and knew where to go. She also prompted us when we had to move on to the next event on our wedding agenda. Thanks to Janice our wedding went perfectly. I would recommend her to anyone looking for a wedding coordinator in the Napa area.

My husband, Justin and I, hired Janice Twomey as our wedding coordinator the fall of 2019 for a July 2020 wedding. Little did we know that the world would turn dark 6 months later ...

due to the pandemic. As a result, July moved to October 2020; October 2020 moved to May 2021. Weddings are difficult to plan; a pandemic makes it 100x more difficult given the extra logistics. For us, it was most important we walked away with a wedding where the guests felt safe. We worked very hard with Janice to ensure this happened. Janice went beyond achieving that—she made our dreams come true. At the very core, Janice has the heart of gold. She is devoted to her clients’ big day. Given the situation of our world today, you need a planner like Janice—a superwoman. Together, we dealt with the pandemic. (I believe fall weddings are in danger of fire season given the lack of rainfall this year; Janice has been in the industry for years and understands what couples need to know when having a fall wedding). Here are snippets of her dedication: Vendor Search: Janice has her selected top vendors. I believe all 3 of our vendors—Sabine Scherer Photography, Soulflower Floral Designs and Rion Designs were all on her list. When I had issues finding a floral designer, I remember fondly Janice texting me after her yoga class (PRE-COVID) brimming with ideas to help me find one I was truly happy with. Contract Review: Janice helped review our contracts prior to signing. Janice helped us negotiate our contract with our venue The Harvest Inn. Throughout the movement of the dates, Janice stayed on top of the venue and all my vendors for not one but two wedding date changes. Creativity: Janice thinks on her feet and is brimming with ideas on photography, cocktails, food, and fashion, given her experience working in the luxury hotel and restaurant business. I had a Bridgerton theme for my wedding and she put in all those elements where she could into my day to the point where guests could guess the source of my inspiration. Passion: Janice has the greatest love and passion for what she does. Even though she was just our wedding coordinator, she somehow was able to help pick up smore ingredients and decorative flowers for my cocktail arrangements; she drove me around nail salons to help me fix a chipped nail on the same day as my rehearsal dinner; she always asked how I was feeling/doing when I had issues getting into a dress after being in sweats all year long… the list goes on. It’s these little moments that truly show just how much she cares and that she is there for you, through and through. I would recommend anyone looking for a wedding coordinator/planner to hire Janice Twomey.

pected! Janice has tailored recommendations, a bullet-proof timeline, manages and keeps all other vendors accountable, and provides a tier 1 level of service. She knows every wedding vendor and location in wine country, and will help you navigate what feels like a chaotic number of choices to ensure you have the personal, unique and beautiful wedding of your dreams. Janice helped make our vision a reality and kept everything running so smoothly. Shockingly, we were both so relaxed and were able to enjoy our wedding day with zero crisis or worry (I hear this is very unusual from all of my friends!!). Further, she pointed out corrections and adjustments in wedding contracts where, simply put, she paid for herself. If you don't think you need a wedding planner, you just don't yet realize you need Janice. She is truly a rare find. So, if she is available, book her immediately!

We cannot give enough praise for Janice. From the first phone call to assisting with vendor issues after the wedding. Janice is a class act. We do not know what we would done with...

out her! The initial phone call: We were skeptical of using a planner but because our venue required one. I had my initial phone call with Janice and found her to be super professional. She asked how far along we were with the planning, we spoke about what we envisioned, what I thought we needed - at the end of the call she said she'd send me a follow up email of what we talked about and provide me her vendor list (can I say well-connected and I wasn't even a client yet) to assist with our planning. We had two more phone calls before signing the contract - Janice was not the cheapest option but she was the one who we thought would manage our wedding the best. Site visit: During our site visit with the venue coordinator, Janice was helpful taking our vision and walking/talking us through what she thought would work best in terms of decor placement, cake/dessert bar, photo booth set-up, seating, menu selections, etc. We probably spent close to 3 hours in total at the venue with Janice discussing all the nitty-gritty details. Vendor contract review/vendor interactions: As our wedding planner, Janice required a copy of all vendor contracts. She reviewed these in detail to ensure we had fair pricing and good contract terms. Wedding Timeline: Janice provided a timeline template which we filled out with our initial thoughts. She adjusted the timeline based on her professional judgment (traffic, photo times, etc.) - she even added a mini break directly after the ceremony so we could have some newlywed alone time before the craziness. Wedding Rehearsal: During the rehearsal she walked through where everyone should sit, stand, and start. She was a drill sergeant - making sure everyone understand what needed to get done to ensure we had a perfect wedding day. Wedding Day: Janice and her assistant made sure that everything was on schedule down to the minute (ceremony started exactly at 5:30 pm, dinner started exactly at 7:15pm, last song to be played at 10:45pm). They set-up the venue with our personal items just as we had requested and also re-purposed floral arrangements from the ceremony site to the reception site. Any issues that my husband or I had during the wedding (missing utensils, warm wine, shuffling early leavers onto the shuttle buses, etc.) - Janice took care of. After the wedding: Janice followed up with us shortly after the wedding to check in. We reported to her that our wedding did not happen without a hitch – shared with her the service issues at the rehearsal dinner venue as well as food and service not meeting expectations at the wedding venue itself. Janice took initiative and contacted both venues and provided our feedback to them. After multiple calls with Janice and the venues - she assisted in negotiating an account credit. This action was greatly appreciated as no one likes to deal with conflict (and extra money back in our pocket). Overall: We could not have had our wedding without Janice's assistance - she was worth every penny! We found her to be super helpful, organized and professional from beginning to end. If you're planning an event (any event) - you need Janice!

Janice was absolutely wonderful!! My partner and I were very organized with our wedding plans and honestly didn’t think we needed a coordinator but we were required to by our venue...

which was a blessing because we hired Janice! She thought of all the little things we wouldn’t have ever thought about and was incredibly helpful, professional but also friendly and sweet, responsive, kind, extremely organized, and goes above and beyond. She genuinely cares about your day and your experience and is available to help you with whatever you need. She was awesome and I cannot recommend her enough! If you need a wedding coordinator, which you do, go with Janice. We love her.
