big day, everything ran flawlessly. They truly took care of it all- catering, bar, photobooth, floral centerpieces, officiant, and more! So we could focus on enjoying ourselves. One standout moment was right at the start of our reception: they surprised us with our very first photo as newlyweds, printed and ready to hold. Such a thoughtful and memorable touch! I also have to shout out Taylor (in the planning office), Taylor (our banquet manager), Amanda (our amazing day-of coordinator), and the rest of the staff for their professionalism and warmth. We received countless compliments from our guests about how smoothly the event was run, the quality of service, and the delicious food. And as a bonus - they even helped me pull off a hilarious prank on the groom during our “first look,” with a groomsman standing in for me. It was perfection. Highly recommend this venue to anyone looking for an organized, stress-free, and joy-filled wedding day.

nd of our wedding night went so seamlessly. The entire team are true professionals, and it is apparent how deeply they care about their couples. We felt so cared for and our vision was executed flawlessly. We would recommend this venue to anyone! I not only enjoyed but looked forward to all of our planning meetings. The team was so prompt with responding to any of my questions via text or email throughout the entire process. When it came to our wedding day, everything just fell into place. It all felt so organic, natural and relaxed. Partly due to how we structured it, but also a huge testament to all the work the team does behind the scenes. It was everything we could have hoped for, yet more than we ever could have dreamed of. We will cherish the memories of our wedding here all the days of our lives.

Hiddenbrooke Hills is a phenomenal venue. What sold us on them initially was they provided a binder with every detail we could ever think of -- food, cake, florals, timeline (plan...

ning and day of), down to whether or not you wanted your pet in the wedding. They have a number of recommended/partnered vendors, but aside from linens and tables, catering, and bartender, you could opt in or out of any vendors you wanted to fully customize your day. And the catering and bartenders were excellent, and they have some excellent options for chairs, tables, and linens -- so don't let this deter you! They were incredible communicators and reassured us every step of the way. The entire team really went above and beyond. Our day-of coordinator Christina was friendly, organized, gave us space when we needed but kept us to our timeline, and really made us feel like guests at our own wedding in the best way possible. Our banquet captain Eric went out of his way to ensure that us as well as our immediate families were treated like royalty the entire night, and we truly felt like honored guests on our own wedding day. The venue itself is very romantic. The outdoor ceremony site feels private and the aisle and archway is actually paved for the bridal party -- a game-changer for anyone wearing heels! We opted to do an indoor ceremony due to the weather, and the indoor ceremony site feels just as well thought out and romantic as the outdoor option. It felt like a log cabin surrounded by greenery. The entire walkway from indoor ceremony site to cocktail hour location to reception is covered. The cocktail hour location is a cute fireside area with enormous windows and exposed stonework. It feels cozy and was a perfect space for our guests. It also is adjacent to our reception area, which was perfect if our guests wanted a quieter place to chat during open dancing. The reception area is super romantic with white drapery and enormous windows, with doors that can be propped open for crossflow and a quiet HVAC system to keep everyone comfortable. Of all the venues we looked at, we felt like we got the best deal for the price here. It was simple to create a custom wedding without feeling "railroaded", but still have enough options to feel guided instead of lost. Everything -- from the partnered vendors, to the site, to the staff -- felt like it was a luxury experience. Definitely check out Hiddenbrooke -- you won't be disappointed!

Rating is a 3.5 but will round up because despite hiccups, we had a great experience and will round my review up. Christina, Taylor and Kaitlin was very responsive whenever I email...

ed questions, which made the process smooth and stress-free. I especially loved the all-inclusive aspect--it made everything so much easier and the pricing was really reasonable. The appetizers and main course were really good. We especially loved the cake from Old Town Danville. Also the wedding extraganza helped a lot in deciding certain things we wanted at our wedding. Our day of coordinator Kaitlin and banquet captain, Eric was attentive, checking in with us to ensure we had everything we needed. Areas that could have been improved. The flowers from A Loves in Bloom should be labeled. At least the ones in the bride suite were not. It was hard to tell which corsages were for whom. Also we realized that the uncles got bigger boutonnieres than the groom/best man. So we later on had to swap them right before the ceremony. Our officiant from Yours Truly was also not the most pleasant. From our first call, to all the times we reached out to the owner, he was very forward and bluntly stated that certain tasks weren't his job or that we were supposed to reach out. While that may have been true, his responses could have been delivered in a much nicer tone. I know he's been in the business a long time but as a first time bride, I did not feel respected at all. On the wedding day, my friend, who was supposed to help coordinate on-site, told me she had to chase down Kaitlin and wasn't given clear guidance on what she was supposed to be doing. I later found out that many items--like a poster stand, candles, and table numbers--were available through the venue. It would have been incredibly helpful to know this upfront instead of having to ask, as it could have saved us money from buying them ourselves. Also, I felt that some communication could have been better with providing information that could help the bride. I didn't know we were supposed to provide Danville the ones who had dietary restrictions so I sent the email to Hiddenbrooke. No one mentioned I should send it to Danville until I reached back out to the team to check if they processed it or needed to send it to Danville. Lastly, I realized that I am missing some items that the banquet captain was supposed to pack after my wedding.

st make sure you dose up on antihistamines in the spring. Reception: "Simple and elegant" is how our guests described it. We used the venue-provided candelabras and the basic linens and it looked lovely. The room feels kind of like a greenhouse and you are surrounded by trees and views of the golf course. We had about 110 and had plenty of room - 8 people per table and enough space for dancing and mingling Staff and service: Everyone was great! We didn't have a wedding coordinator but the folks here made us feel like we didn't need one. They helped us through the details and kept us on schedule during the big day. They missed a couple of little details but nothing that couldn't be remedied once we noticed them. They also provided overnight storage for gifts and our harpist's harp so that was extremely helpful. Our guests also had good reviews for the bartenders and servers. Food: the mac and cheese is amazing!! So were the egg rolls. By all accounts dinner was tasty. Cons: $1200 for the ceremony site seemed steep. We couldn't bring our own homebrew due to license issues. Overall we had a good time, our guests had a good time, and we'd do it all again.

hen I was visiting and just knowing that the people who worked there cared to make my day a great one was nice. I visited other places and wasn't even greeted! It was nice to always get a call back or an email back - granted the director switched mid-planning so it was a little confusing, it all worked out. Even though not everything went as scheduled because nothing ever works out perfectly, everything still went well and there are awesome places to take great pictures. (Though the venue doesn't get to choose), the weather was perfect for our wedding at the beginning of October. I haven't even gotten our professional pictures back yet, but the pictures my friends took look awesome, so I can't wait. My husband loves golfing and he even got a free golf round after our early morning rehearsal the day before (that was his bachelor party). Overall I'd recommend it. It was a little far from the East Bay where I'm from (especially with 80E traffic), but there are hotels near by for people who live a little bit further out. I planned the wedding from Tennessee and it all worked out even though I was so far away.
