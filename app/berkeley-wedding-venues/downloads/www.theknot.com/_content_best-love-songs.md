A romantic song full of beautiful imagery about kissing one's lover, this track featured on the band's 1997 album _Sixpence None the Richer_. The song acted as a theme song in the famous 1999 teen film "She's All That."

### 111\. "(Everything I Do) I Do It For You," by Bryan Adams

**Lyrics you'll love:** "I can't help it/There's nothin' I want more/You know it's true/Everything I do/I do it for you"

Bryan Adams' international chart-topper from 1991, this ballad is an equally popular tune for first dances and karaoke nights. 

### 112\. "Truly Madly Deeply," by Savage Garden

**Lyrics you'll love:** "I'll be your dream, I'll be your wish, I'll be your fantasy/I'll be your hope, I'll be your love, be everything that you need"

You likely know—and love—this memorable pop song from Savage Garden's debut studio album. If you don't, its name alone should indicate how applicable it is to a day celebrating true love. 

### 113\. "Because You Loved Me," by Celine Dion

**Lyrics you'll love:** "You gave me wings and made me flyYou touched my hand, I could touch the sky/I lost my faith, you gave it back to me/You said no star was out of reach"

There's no justification needed for reserving Celine Dion a spot in your wedding playlist. 1996's "Because You Loved Me" is just one of many absolutely breathtaking songs from the icon worthy of your first dance, a father-daughter dance or a slow dance at your wedding. 

### 114\. "From This Moment On," by Shania Twain

**Lyrics you'll love:** "I give my hand to you with all my heart/I can't wait to live my life with you/I can't wait to start/You and I will never be apart"

Your wedding is the beginning of one of life's best chapters, making Twain's "From This Moment On" especially appropriate for such an occasion. The track won the award for "Vocal/Instrumental Collaboration of the Year" at the 1999 Canadian Country Music Awards.

### 115\. "This Kiss," by Faith Hill

**Lyrics you'll love:** "It's the way you love me/It's a feeling like this/It's centrifugal motion/It's perpetual bliss/It's that pivotal moment/It's, ah, impossible/This kiss, this kiss (unstoppable)"

Faith Hill's "This Kiss," from 1998's _Faith_ , is the type of love song you can't help but sing along to. Play it during your reception, and it will evoke feelings of love, happiness and fun in those in attendance.

### 116\. "Always Be My Baby," by Mariah Carey

**Lyrics you'll love:** "You'll always be apart of me/I'm part of you indefinitely/Boy don't you know you can't escape me/Oh darlin' 'cause you'll always be my baby"

The track record of Carey's hit "Always Be My Baby" speaks for itself. The song topped the _Billboard_ Hot 100 chart, and it is certified _five times_ platinum in the U.S. If you or your soon-to-be spouse love the living legend, why not sway to this song for your first dance?

### 117\. "As Long As You Love Me," by Backstreet Boys

**Lyrics you'll love:** "Every little thing that you have said and done/Feels like it's deep within me/Doesn't really matter if you're on the run/It seems like we're meant to be"

This 1997 hit from the beloved boy band was likely a staple of your youth. Let it make for a fun, sentimental moment at your reception.

### 118\. "More Than Words," by Extreme

**Lyrics you'll love:** "Hold me close, don't ever let me go/More than words is all I ever needed you to show/Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me/'Cause I'd already know"

Extreme's sweet-sounding "More Than Words" was released in 1900, on their _Extreme II: Pornograffitti_ album. Fans of the tune or the rock band could waltz to it during their first dance.

### 119\. "I Don't Want to Miss a Thing," by Aerosmith

**Lyrics you'll love:** "Don't wanna close my eyes/I don't wanna to fall asleep/'Cause I'd miss you baby/And I don't wanna miss a thing/'Cause even when I dream of you/The sweetest dream would never do/I'd still miss you baby/And I don't wanna miss a thing"

Aerosmith's "I Don't Want to Miss a Thing," from 1998's album of the same name, is the type of stellar wedding ballad that could be overdone—but the music and lyrics are so enjoyable that it's nearly impossible to ever get sick of the song.

## **2000s Love Songs**

These recommended love songs were released between 2000 and 2010, yet you, your spouse and your guests still likely remember their every word. What's better than belting a beloved tune at your wedding while surrounded by all your loved ones?

### 120\. "Ain't No Other Man," by Christina Aguilera

**Lyrics you'll love:** "Ain't no other man can stand up next to you/Ain't no other man on the planet does what you do/You're the kinda guy a girl finds in a blue moon"

This song is a soulful, gritty and over-the-top tribute that shows up on Aguilera's 2006 album, _Back to Basics_. It has hints of retro musical influences and is inspired by her husband, whom she married the year before.

### 121\. "Hero," by Enrique Iglesias

**Lyrics you'll love:** "I can be your hero, baby/I can kiss away the pain/I will stand by you forever/You can take my very breath away"

Women everywhere wanted Iglesias to be their hero when this top love song came out on the 2001 _Escape_ album. Lines like "Would you tremble if I touched your lips?" make it a sensual and epic love ballad that adds a touch of drama to any wedding.

### 122\. "I Need You," by LeAnn Rimes

**Lyrics you'll love:** "I need you like water, like breath, like rain/I need you like mercy from Heaven's gate/There's a freedom in your arms/That carries me through/I need you"

You may have forgotten about this classic country-pop song from Rimes, but one listen will have you reminiscing on its greatness. With an underlying tone of Christianity in the song, it's a great first dance option for religious couples.

### 123\. "When I Look At You," by Miley Cyrus

**Lyrics you'll love:** "When I look at you, I see forgiveness/I see the truth/You love me for who I am/Like the stars hold the moon/Right there where they belong/And I know I'm not alone"

Shooting to popularity after appearing in the 2010 film _The Last Song_ , Cyrus's "When I Look at You" has a spot in the hearts of many people who grew up fans of the singer. The ballad continues to be pleasing to the ears, and its message is perfect for a big day celebration.

### 124\. "You and Me," by Lifehouse 

**Lyrics you'll love:** "'Cause it's you and me/And all of the people with nothing to do/Nothing to lose/And it's you and me and all of the people/And I don't know why/I can't keep my eyes off of you"

With over 500 million streams on Spotify, 2005's "You and Me" is a fan-favorite love song that has stood the test of time. It's extremely popular and yet underrated enough to pleasantly surprise guests during your wedding. 

### 125\. "Yellow," by Coldplay

**Lyrics you'll love:** "Look at the stars/Look how they shine for you/And all the things that you do"

Few songs are held as dearly as Coldplay's "Yellow" is to people worldwide. (The song has almost _two billion_ streams on Spotify.) From the band's 2000 album, _Parachutes_ , the song expresses love and devotion via lyrics that are true poetry. 

### 126\. "Love Story," by Taylor Swift

**Lyrics you'll love:** "He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring/And said, "Marry me, Juliet/You'll never have to be alone/I love you and that's all I really know/I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress/It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes""

Although Taylor Swift's "Love Story" came out over 15 years ago, originally released on her _Fearless_ album, the song feels just as popular today. It's a staple of reception playlists—especially if Swifties will be in attendance. 

### 127\. "She Will Be Loved," by Maroon 5

**Lyrics you'll love:** "I don't mind spending every day/Out on your corner in the pouring rain/Look for the girl with the broken smile/Ask her if she wants to stay a while/And she will be loved"

From 2002's _Songs About Jane_ album, "She Will Be Loved" was an instant classic, peaking at number 5 in the U.S., number 4 in the United Kingdom and number 1 in Australia. The tune is still cherished today and could be incorporated into your cocktail hour or reception playlist.

### 128\. "Just the Way You Are," by Bruno Mars

**Lyrics you'll love:** "And when you smile/The whole world stops and stares for a while/'Cause girl, you're amazing/Just the way you are"

The second "Just the Way You Are" on the list is Bruno Mars' groundbreaking 2010 pop single. It's hard to imagine anyone _doesn't_ know the words to this Grammy Award-winning, chart-topping love song.

### 129\. "Wherever You Will Go," by The Calling

**Lyrics you'll love:** "If I could, then I would/I'll go wherever you will go/Way up high or down low/I'll go wherever you will go"

It's hard not to love this debut single from The Calling's 2001 album, _Camino Palmero_. Plus, with lyrics all about the power of love, it's an exceptional (and perhaps underrated) wedding song.

### 130\. "If I Ain't Got You," by Alicia Keys

**Lyrics you'll love:** "Some people want it all/But I don't want nothing at all/If it ain't you, baby/If I ain't got you, baby"

Last on the list is Keys' legendary "If I Ain't Got You," from 2003's _The Diary of Alicia Keys_. The song is a worthy contender for first dances everywhere.
