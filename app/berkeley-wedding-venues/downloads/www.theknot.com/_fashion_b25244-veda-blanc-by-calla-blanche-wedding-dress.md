Description

A ball gown wedding dress with two distinct looks in one, Veda transforms with ease to suit your mood. Her structured satin design (available in mikado or silky satin) features a romantic sweetheart neckline trimmed in beaded lace and can be worn strapless or with detachable off-the-shoulder straps for added softness. The full skirt is finished with a modern basque waistline and functional pockets, while a trail of satin-covered buttons extends into a regal train. She’s timeless and versatile with a quietly dramatic charm.
