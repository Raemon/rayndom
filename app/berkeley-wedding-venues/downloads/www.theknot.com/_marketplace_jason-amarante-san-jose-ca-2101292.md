Professional, fun, and a packed dance floor! We cannot recommend Jason Amarante highly enough! From the start, Jason was incredibly organized, professional, and easy to work with....

We met with him beforehand to discuss the vibe of our wedding and our music preferences, and he absolutely delivered. My husband is from Uruguay, and we had several specific song requests that aren’t easy to find. Jason went above and beyond to track them down and seamlessly incorporate them into the night, which meant so much to us and our guests. Jason’s MC skills were outstanding—polished, professional, and never cheesy. He kept the energy perfect and the dance floor packed all night long with his great music selection and ability to read the crowd. An added bonus was how Jason helped keep us on track with our timeline. We didn’t have a wedding planner, but he made sure the evening flowed smoothly and stayed on schedule, allowing us to truly relax and enjoy our night. We highly recommend Jason if you’re looking for a fun, professional, and reliable wedding DJ!

We recently hired Jason to serve as the DJ and MC for our wedding, and he exceeded every expectation. From the beginning, he was consistently professional, organized, and clearly...

experienced in managing the details of large events. His attention to detail, strong communication skills, and overall professionalism immediately put us at ease. We selected specific songs for key moments and trusted him with the rest. His ability to read the room was exceptional, and multiple guests—including my sister‑in‑law—remarked that it was the best DJ performance they had ever experienced. In addition to his DJ work, Jason coordinated seamlessly with the venue staff to ensure the event flowed smoothly. We had previously seen him perform at other weddings and festivals, and he has always delivered a high quality experience. Our venue offered a list of preferred DJs at a lower rate, we chose to work with Jason even with an added fee—and we would make the same decision again without hesitation.

Jason was amazing to work with! We had a wedding of two diverse cultures and he brought the party to life making sure our requests were fulfilled to be sure everyone had an amazing...

time. He was very helpful in helping us create a curated list with realistic times and a schedule that flowed well. He was very easy to work with, brought such fun energy to the party, and did a great job as MC for the night. I would highly recommend him to other couples looking for a reliable, thoughtful, and fun DJ. People still to this day tell me how much fun at our wedding, and I know they are referring to Jason’s work on that day, bringing our vision to life.

Jason did an incredible job DJing our wedding. He met with us a couple months prior to our wedding date. During this meeting he got to learn about the wedding, vibes, set up, music...

needs, etc. The day of the event he made sure everything was set up perfectly and kept our dance floor packed from 7-11pm! 10 out 10 would recommend!

If you want a DJ for any event who can perfect everything from MC to song selection, look no further than Jason Amarante. This guy absolutely nailed our wedding and really pulled t...

he entire thing together. And I'll tell you why. Our first meeting with Jason was seamless. He was accommodating and had absolutely no problem chatting with us for as long as possible to ensure we were able to execute everything to perfection. Ironically, he was familiar with some of our other vendors, from the caterer to the photographer, even though we were 100 miles from home. As such, he let us know common trends among our vendors to ensure preparation and a concise timeline of how the night would unfold, which is a testament as to why is so highly coveted. He was on top of it. He helped select different tracks that would accommodate all 370 guests, form young children to older folks. He had everyone on the dance floor the entire time. He was the life of the party. We had some special requests, from modifying songs to song selections for the garter toss, bouquet toss, father-daughter dance, etc., that Jason executed to perfection. No questions asked. He was incredibly responsive with our requests as well. Jason set the ambiance straight from beginning, from cocktail hour to dinner, with an array of different genres that set the tone for the night. Some of our guests has song requests, and Jason delivered every single time. At no point during our wedding did we ever worry about Jason. We didn't have a coordinator for our event, but Jason was able to help coordinate different parts of our special day. He was our Swiss army knife. This allowed us to focus on other parts of our wedding. If you're looking for the total package in terms of a DJ, MC and everything in between, look no further than Jason Amarante.

Jason was a phenomenal DJ for our wedding and reception! During planning, he asked us questions about our vision for our wedding day, musical and style tastes, and priorities. He ...

gave us a sample timeline to work from and offered valuable guidance on the ceremony and rehearsal flow/sequence of events. We were married on the beach and he provided the music for the guest arrival, processional, ceremony, and recessional, plus a mic for the officiant. The sound quality was great. Once the party moved indoors, he got the vibe going immediately. We are so glad we put our trust in Jason – he’s absolutely 1st class and we recommend him very highly!

lace at The Hideout at Kirkwood, which can be a bit tricky logistically, but Jason handled everything flawlessly. He was professional, organized, and such a pleasure to work with throughout the entire process. The music selection flowed perfectly from ceremony to dinner to dancing — Jason really knew how to read the crowd and keep everyone on the dance floor all night long. His attention to detail and commitment to making our wedding special showed in every moment. We can’t recommend Jason enough to any couple looking for a talented, professional, and genuinely great person to work with. Thank you again, Jason, for being such a huge part of our day!
