In September of this year, I hosted a 100-year birthday celebration for my mother that was attended by 200+ family and friends. People are still raving about it and referring to i...

t as the "Event of the Year." Prior to the venue selection, I combed the entire Tri-Valley for two months(2), looking for the perfect venue to host the perfect event. I wanted a venue that not only elevated my vision but also accentuated it. My key requirements were many including cost, size/capacity, location/accessibility, staff support/flexibility, ambiance/decor and food and beverage preparations. After visiting many beautiful venues, I found only one that could meet all of my established criteria....The Club at Ruby Hill. A special shout out to Kymberlie Avila(Sales Director) and Samantha Perreira((Events Manager), for being incredibly attentive and professional. They both intuitively recognized my stresses and ALWAYS seamlessly solved my "henny penny, the sky is falling" problems, with care, concern and a smile. Of particular note, many of my guests favorably commented on the friendly, efficient service provided by the wait staff that were responsible for the food service and table management. I can save you some time by promising you that if you are looking for a beautiful, one-stop shop, "OOH AWWW" venue, that cares as much about your event as you do, save yourself some time and visit THE CLUB AT RUBY HILL. You will be happy that you did!

The food was incredible, both in presentation and flavor. Guests raved throughout the night, and the compliments continued long after the evening was over. The staff at Ruby Hill were exceptional—warm, attentive, and unfailingly professional. They anticipated needs before we even voiced them and ensured that every moment flowed seamlessly. A special thank-you to Kymberlie and her team, whose expertise and graciousness made the entire planning process so easy and so fabulous. Their thoughtful guidance elevated the experience even further and helped us create a night our students and families will never forget. It was a magnificent celebration—beautifully hosted, flawlessly executed, and truly unforgettable. We cannot recommend The Club at Ruby Hill highly enough.

Take it from a professional event planner with over 30 years of experience and a long list of happy clients, The Club at Ruby Hill is one of the best venues for any type of events and celebrations.

The venue itself is beautiful, but the staff were not helpful on the day of. It seemed like there was no central point of contact from the venue to work with on our wedding day asi...

de from just the bartenders, servers, etc. Also, the overall quality of food leaves much to be desired; I recommend going with outside catering instead. Entrée service was delayed by almost 30 minutes which left some guests impatient. One last issue; the guest entrance to the ceremony grounds walks past some very large garbage bins which leaves a pretty poor first impression. Guests aren’t intended to enter through the main entrance since the reception hall doesn’t open until after the ceremony and cocktail hour. That being said, both the venue and its location are just as beautiful as the photos, so I would choose it all over again as the top option in the Bay.

ommunity surrounded by a picturesque golf course, and the inside was spacious and perfect for a large gathering. We had our tea ceremony in the lobby, the larger ceremony outside, and dinner and dancing in the main ballroom. The team at the Club at Ruby Hill was responsive and very easy to work with. The on-site menu tasting was my favorite part of the process because we got to try a majority of the menu, meet the chef, and connect with the team that helped facilitate the behind-the-scenes operations at our wedding. They provided personalized menus and gifted us a bottle of champagne so the day felt really special. We spoke to mainly Samantha and Tiffani, and both were a pleasure to work with. Highly recommend for those looking for a wedding venue!

The formal ambiance and particularly the staff made Ruby Hill an easy decision. Everything was beyond perfect and made us feel so special from the signing of the contract, answering e-mails and walk throughs I knew I could relax and enjoy my daughter's wedding. The day of the wedding I was in awe of how much all those tiny details that I focused on was done effortlessly. The food and service was everything we have hoped for a fantastic black tie formal evening. Tiffani Lew in particular is so professional and so experienced I trusted that I was in great hands and was so impressed working with her. The only thing I wished for was more time for the day . Everything went so fast and before we knew it the lights were on and the last dance was over. I loved everything about Ruby Hill and the staff that takes care of you. Best Decision Ever!

If they do not provide something, they have a vendor recommendation list to fill any of your venue needs. Our food tasting was a wonderful experience and allowed us to pick exactly what we wanted for our menu and more. You know the meal is good, when all your guests are complimenting you on how delicious each selection was. The staff was attentive and friendly. Even during the reception any request was treated with importance which was fantastic. Working with Tiffani was a pleasure. She was informative, thorough, and very professional.

The photos we took in front of the giant oak tree turned out stunning, as well as the photos at the top of the staircase. We had our bridal party introduced down the big stair case each with their own "walk out song", followed by our entrance and we heard from so many guests how much they loved it. The reception space is so grand that you really don't need much decor, saving money and stress. Lastly everyone raved about the dinner food which is always a plus! Highly recommend!

tup the stage - all by herself because the staff could not come until later. This is what I call 'customer service' ! Kudos to Tiffani ! With many of our friends' sons or daughters getting married in the next year or two, I am sure The Club at Ruby Hill will get a lot of references, customers and accolades. From start (in dealing with Chrissy during the sales phase, etc.) to finish (dealing with Kate, Tiffani, etc.), it was a class act.

n of events on the evening of Saturday September 4, 2021 our wedding night. At about 9:45pm, during dinner service at our wedding, the power went out due to PG&E. After the initial shock a we found out that the entire neighborhood was out; however, being at the prestigious Clubhouse at Ruby Hill, we were sure a back-up source would bring up all lights in the building. When this did not happen. 1\. There was no one else on the premises familiar with the building and its backup facilities. Surely any reputable event venue would have a back-up generator, so it was just a matter of having a venue contact to start it. 2\. We had candles on the tables, and some battery-operated up-lights, and after a while a few emergency lights came on.However, outside was completely and fully dark, all around the building where we had set up the desserts and where vendors were having dinner, was completely and fully pitch black. 3\. all ceremony chairs were still in the same position (which made us wonder how we would conduct the much-anticipated sparkler exit)! The chair should have been removed in anticipation of the guests congregating there to light sparklers. 4\. We managed to cut the cake in the dark, but not all guests got to see it and there was no music. When the power went out, it wasn’t just music (which was the absolute livelihood for our young and energetic guests) that got cut off. Enhanced lighting on the floor, up-lights with ceiling designs, disco lights, and the Percussionist amplifier also got cut off. 5\. Staffing was very poor - they are not equipped and staff to handle 200 guests at this venue. This was a particularly important issue from the beginning and we had stressed many times that we wanted the best customer service and service for our guests. We were assured that although staffing had been affected because of the Pandemic, that the venue would ensure we had enough trained staff to tend to the guests. This was certainly not the case. 6\. They were not able to manage service in a professional manner - tables were served with a lot of time lapse in between, so some guests had just finished eating and some just got served. Table service for water and wine was not consistent (not refilled). 7\. Vegetarian guests did not receive their meals.the ones that did were very last ones. After many weeks of emailing and calling Venue finally Andrea Jackson regional manager contacted us. Initially he mentioned he will return all service charges due to their poor services. We did not receive the promised check. When we called back and asked him about it , very rudely and unprofessionally he said you had a good wedding and broke all his promises!!! On this wedding spent almost 75 k and it was ruined. The many months (nearly a year) of work, energy, and psychological and financial commitment, did not make it to fruition. Not due to our own doing or any of the vendor’s doing, but because of neglect on the part of the venue.

Thank god all 200 of our guests didn't end up showing up- even with 170 guests, it took over an hour for everyone to get their food and we had to push back our whole timeline while half our guests were hungry. -It was very cold the night of our wedding and because of COVID, everything was outdoors. We had multiple discussions both via email and in person about heaters. I asked questions like "should we have one heater per table? or what heater per every other table?" and every time my question was dodged and that should have been a red flag.... well it turns out the night of our wedding, they only had 2 heaters. For 20 tables. We had explicitly told our guests there were heaters so imagine our embarrassment when 30 people crowded around one heater to stay warm. -We were offered the grassy area by the pro-shop for cocktail hour. I don't know if there were sprinklers or what, since there was no rain, but the grassy area was completely muddy when our guests got there for cocktail hour. We got a lot of complaints about wrecked shoes. If you have access to alternative spaces at the venue that don't involve grass, pick that instead!

ou. She was very patient and transparent with us throughout the planning and we appreciated it so much! Janan and her team were very organized and on top of everything before and during the day of the wedding. They worked seamlessly alongside our wedding planner and they were able to execute our dream wedding! The service at Ruby Hills exceeded our expectations and our guests were so impressed with the beautiful grounds of the country club. We see so many new profile pictures of our family members with Ruby Hills as the background ;) Not only were the views great, but the food was DELICIOUS. You typically don’t remember the food at a wedding, but the short rib and crispy salmon still talked about with our guests to this day. So in short, we highly recommend booking your wedding (or any event) at Ruby Hills!!

We LOVED our wedding at Ruby Hill. We held our small, 25 person wedding at Ruby Hill in Sept. 2020. Our first wedding date was canceled so we found Ruby Hill in July 2020 and were ...

able to plan and implement the wedding in three months. We worked with Jennifer to plan a wedding that included a ceremony, outdoor cocktail hour, dinner, dancing, and a Zoom virtual setup for our virtual guests. Jennifer was helpful and accommodated everything we needed to make this happen including: early arrival for our vendors to help socially distance, full wired internet access for the Zoom connection (most important for us and our virtual guests), full access to the grounds and outdoor space for photos, access to social-table software to plan seating charts and ceremony layout, and excel sheets to work with budgets. Being a very detail-oriented person myself, I appreciated how attentive and responsive Jennifer was to my emails and requests for information which is needed for hiring all the other vendors. I appreciated the attention to details ahead of time which makes for a stress free planning process! Thank you!

d at the beautiful Club at Ruby Hill in April 2020, but you already know what happened.....it never happened. We postponed several times and ultimately decided to cancel our wedding. Let me just start with saying that the Club at Ruby Hill is one of our top wedding venue choices. The theme for our wedding is best described as a glamorous, black tie event, and this venue hit the mark for us. Do you know what made it even better? Working with Jennifer Franklin, the Events Sales Director. We met her in March 2019 and booked with her in April 2019. She's so wonderful to work with and has been so nice and accommodating in this whole wedding planning and cancelling process, and especially during these unprecedented times. We are so happy to have worked with her as she has set the bar high. She helped us review our menu choices, decor choices, and provided some great vendors to partner with and tons of great wedding planning advice, she's a wedding pro! If you're thinking of touring this venue or booking this venue for your wedding or event, please ask for Jennifer! You won't regret it! Also, the food and views are amazing here!

We knew when we walked into The Club more than a year from our wedding date that this was the venue of our dreams! From the high ceilings, the grand staircase, and the golf course ...

backdrop, this location is nothing short of a dream. Janan was a pleasure to work ever since our first meeting as she was responsive and super helpful with our wedding planning. She was quick to answer questions to my numerous emails and really was just so patient with me. She works with so many couples and really made us feel special whenever we met or spoke. We worked together for over a year having in person meetings and through emails regarding anything and everything wedding related. Fast forward to a year of planning, we couldn't have been more excited for our wedding day! At our rehearsal walk through, my husband and I dropped off a bunch of decor for Janan and her team to set up the next day. I left instructions on each box on how things should be placed for our ceremony and reception. Janan was super attentive and was patient while I explained where each piece of decor was supposed to be set up. Rehearsal went smooth despite our huge wedding party. This isn't Janan's first rodeo so she was able to gather and round up everyone and do our walk through. This lasted about an hour. On the day of our wedding, we entered the venue and we were just in awe. All the decor we left for Janan and her team was placed perfectly and lit up the room. We can't thank them enough. My husband and I were in "go-go-go" mode that day so we were so thankful that we did not have to worry about setting up the reception/ceremony. Janan greeted us on wedding day and was the captain of our ship. She worked with our wedding party and venders and made sure everyone was where they were supposed to be. The staff and bartenders were very kind to me and my husband and we thank them for taking care of our wedding of 150 guests. Thank you to the chef and kitchen staff because our guests could not stop raving about the food! Our short rib and chicken duet plates were a hit! We would recommend The Club at Ruby Hill for any couple who is looking to have a beautiful grand wedding. We wish we could relive the best day of our lives!

I can’t tell you how many anxious phone calls/e-mails she received from us. Yet, she always provided a knowledgeable and reassuring response. All of our guests were raving about how gorgeous the venue was and how incredible the food was. We chose the filet mignon and scallops. To be honest, I wasn’t sure if it was possible to pull off a meal like that for nearly 200 people. To my surprise, the chef did an exceptional job. The steak was very tender and juicy. I can’t say enough good things about this incredible venue. I feel so fortunate to have had my wedding here.

h was the same person for us, Jennifer Franklin). During our wedding venue hunting experience, we were met with either seemingly uninterested or just plain rude wedding salespeople until we met Jennifer. Myself not having any experience with planning events let alone a wedding, she was able to make this experience more fun and relaxed. Whenever my then fiance and I would stress about something, she would find a way to destress the situation and walk us through the issue we were facing. She was able to listen to our requests and provide suggestions where she saw fit without being so imposing on her own personal opinions. In our eyes and our guests' eyes, the end result was a flawless night. If there was an issue during the event, it was masked because we didn't see it and neither did our guests. We got compliments left and right from our guests on how beautiful the venue was and how much FUN they had. From people who have been to a million weddings, they showered us with compliments on how "lit" yet elegant it was. Again, my wife and I have to give Jennifer and the rest of the Ruby Hill staff a huge thanks for a PERFECT wedding reception.

We just had our wedding two weeks ago at The Club at Ruby Hill. This venue deserves the best rating for a lot of reasons: 1\. The venue is located in a gated community. Guests need ...

to have an ID to enter from the main gate. So it has all the privacy you need for a wedding (as opposed to a hotel, for example). 2\. The venue is located in a very scenery community, which has beautiful lawns, trees, lakes. On our wedding day we took photos on the arch bridge over a lake near the main gate, which came out amazing. 3\. The venue, which is a golf clubhouse, has all the facilities you look for in a wedding: both outdoor and indoor ceremony spots, indoor ceremony spot, a standard hardwood dance floor that is centered among the reception tables, cocktail reception area with outdoor heating devices, brides and grooms room, etc. 4\. The clubhouse has quite an upscale look. The design, furniture, decoration, ceiling, etc., all look pretty spectacular. 5\. The staff members are great. We worked closely with the event manager Jennifer F in preparing for the wedding. Planning for the wedding was not a simple task and Jennifer gave us great help. She was very approachable, attentive to details, thoughtful and caring. I'd like to say that I wish I knew more people like Jennifer in my life. 6\. The cost is surprisingly affordable. We booked it in February, during which they had the winter discount. But even without the discount, their price would still be reasonable. In choosing a perfect wedding, we visited more than 10 venues around the bay area. Most of them ask for more money and have less to offer, as compared to The Club at Ruby Hill. Our wedding went very well and it will be a piece of important and fond memory for us. I'm glad and feel fortunate that we chose the right venue (and of course put a lot of efforts into it).

My now husband was the one who suggested The Club at Ruby Hill to me, and wow, I’m so glad he did. As soon as we walked in for our tour, about 1 year in advance of our wedding date...

, we both fell in love. It was a no brainer for us. We met with Janan, and luckily for us, we were stuck with her. ;) Firstly, Janan was absolutely amazing to work with. Both my husband and I had SO many questions, constantly, and she was so patient with us, and answered everything in a timely manner. I feel like as our day-of coordinator, she went above and beyond for us. Second, the venue is absolutely gorgeous. We haven’t come across a better looking venue in all of the wedding venues we’ve been to. The staff made sure everything ran smoothly, and that my husband and I were taken care of, as well as our guests. Our 150 guests said the dinner was the best wedding food they’ve ever had, and that the venue was the most beautiful they’ve ever seen. We loved the flow of events for our guests – from the ceremony location to cocktail hour, to the reception, and where the bars were. I would highly recommend The Club at Ruby Hill – you will not be disappointed!

o offer for the ceremony, cocktail hour, and bridal/groom suites perfectly matched our needs for the day. From the beginning of our wedding planning process the staff at Ruby Hills went out of their way to make our experience easy and practical. Jennifer Franklin was our day of coordinator at Ruby Hills and our main point of contact for all of our questions leading up to the big day. Not only was Jennifer of great help in planning for all the details that we wanted to include in our wedding, but she did a flawless job executing all those details for us on the day of, not a single thing we asked for was left out. She did a great job in keeping us and our large bridal party on schedule throughout the day, and did so in the most calm, practical, and professional manner. Thanks to Jennifer and the rest of the Ruby Hills team, we were really able to enjoy ourselves on our wedding day and had nothing to worry about. We also want to add that their list of preferred vendors were all top notch and we were very happy with the choices we made on photographer, flowers, cake, etc. Not only were our vendors all great, but it made it stress free that they were all already familiar with the space and some even offered discount incentives for booking them through Ruby Hills. Overall, having our wedding at Ruby Hills was a wonderful experience, and if we had to do it all over again, we wouldn’t have changed a single detail. We highly recommend to anyone who is considering this venue to make an appointment and see for yourself all the great things it has to offer.

If you are deciding between wedding vendors, please do NOT choose The Club at Ruby Hill. I just had my wedding at Ruby Hill and I wanted to warn you of my experience. My husband a...

nd I are very disappointed in our wedding experience at The Club at Ruby Hill. From its reputation and for the money we paid, we expected more. We left Ruby Hill on our wedding night angry and disappointed. Day of Wedding: 1\. Catering services/meals: Our reception started at 6pm. Half our guests sitting closer to the center received their dinner at 6:30pm. Half our guest (13 tables, total 151 guests) sitting in the periphery, farther from the center, received their dinner 9:20pm. During the wedding speeches/slideshow, we had multiple wedding guests continually run up to us at the sweetheart table to inform us they haven't received their meals yet. As of 9pm, we saw the servers just starting to carry out the entrees to guests sitting in the periphery. My husband and I were stuck at the sweetheart table in front of the spotlight, bombarded with guest complaints and unable to do anything, all the while my Day of Coordinator (Jennifer Franklin) was nowhere to be found to provide any help or assistance. My bridesmaid finally found the Day of Coordinator (Jennifer Franklin) frantically walking in and out of the kitchen. Something had gone wrong in the kitchen, however, we were not informed the day of. Weeks after the wedding, we still have not received an explanation as to what had happened in the kitchen. Why were half my guests served dinner 2.5 hours after the other half? Our reception started at 6pm, serving dinner at 9:20pm is unbelievable and unacceptable. I was heartbroken to see half my guests hungry as they watched other guests eat, and only to receive their own meals as the fed guests were getting ready to leave. 2\. Day of Coordinator (Jennifer Franklin): I could not find my Day-of-Event Coordinator (Jennifer Franklin) when I desperately needed her. I had to stand up from the sweetheart table, during my own wedding, to go look around for her, but she was nowhere to be found between 6:30pm-9:00pm. I had to personally stand up from the sweetheart table multiple times to direct the reception schedule/program and walk over to the DJ to communicate. It was embarrassing, stressful, and frustrating. It was a disaster, no bride or groom should ever have to go through what we did. No bride should have to stand up at the sweetheart table to run the show, during her own wedding; that is the Day of Coordinator's duty. Jennifer Franklin was hired/paid to provide support to the newlywed couple the day of wedding. The Club at Ruby Hill forced newlywed couples to choose from their preferred list of coordinators, so we were not allowed to hire our own outside coordinator. I would never have imagined that their preferred coordinator, Jennifer Franklin, would be so unprofessional. 3\. Bartenders: The Club at Ruby Hill forced us to hire 3 bartenders for our wedding. We paid for 3 bartenders, but there were only 2 bartenders the day of wedding. I spoke to many wedding guests to confirm how many bartenders they saw between the hours of 5:15pm-8:15pm. Our family members, church members and friends all confirmed they saw only 2 bartenders. Ruby Hill forced us to pay extra $250 for the 3rd bartender, but only provided 2 bartenders the day of, which resulted in extremely long lines at the bar. My guests told us they waited 45 minutes in line to get a drink at the bar. That is dishonest business practice. If a wedding vendor charges for 3 bartenders, they should deliver with 3 bartenders, or else it is a breach in contract. 4\. Vendor Meals: We paid for 7 vendor meals: hot, sit-down vendor meals ($40 each), not the boxed meals, because we wanted our hardworking vendors to enjoy a nice meal after a long day. My vendors informed me they starved that night. Ruby Hill gave my 7 vendors 1 plate of tacos for all of them to share. That is not what we paid for, we paid total $280 for 7 hot meals; not one plate of tacos for $280. I am heartbroken that my vendors spent a whole day with us and had barely anything to eat. Before Wedding: In addition to the unsatisfactory wedding day events, the week leading up to the wedding was conducted professionally. The last-minute changes made by Ruby Hill and Jennifer Franklin, five days prior to the wedding were unexpected, uncharacteristic, and very stressful: 1\. Five days prior to the wedding, I was informed that my reception table seating arrangement had to be rearranged, because we were not allowed to have tables on the right-side members-only dining area. For the past 9 months, no one had informed us we were not allowed to have tables on the right-side. In fact, during TWO on-site walk-throughs, Coordinators: Juliet Dorn, Christa Mekki and Jennifer Franklin all suggested to me to put tables outside on the right side. During both walk-throughs, I was never informed of any issues with putting tables on the right side. Five days prior to the wedding, when I had already finalized table seating arrangements and printed out all table place cards, I was informed I would have to move 40 guests elsewhere. The last-minute changes forced me to reorder all table place cards urgently and have them shipped with express shipping, in order for us to receive them in time. I was working fulltime, and the last minute changes forced me to stay up late night to make emergency changes, merely a few days before my wedding. 2\. Five days prior to my wedding, I was informed that Ruby Hill did not know that a traditional Chinese tea ceremony was scheduled from 3-4pm. I had informed Ruby Hill 9 months ago, and the request was approved. Months in advance, I had already informed all family members to arrive at early for the tea ceremony. Five days prior to the wedding, I had no other back-up plan or alternative location for the tea ceremony. I had submitted the wedding worksheet 2 months prior to the wedding. I would like to know why no one at Ruby Hill had reviewed my worksheet and warned me of potential problems. My wedding worksheet was not reviewed until 5 days before my wedding. The professionalism of Ruby Hill staff is questionable and not up to standard. To this day, we never received an apology or an explanation of what had happened that night. The kitchen and bartending staff clearly could not handle 300 guests. Ruby Hill should not advertise as being able to cater that guest capacity. Reasons not to choose Ruby Hill: 1\. Incapable catering service 2\. Unprofessional Day of Event Coordinator (Jennifer Franklin) 3\. Dishonest business practice When I originally booked Ruby Hill, I had imagined Ruby Hill to go above and beyond in quality of service. I had no doubt, based on all the positive reviews and awards. I am shocked and disappointed, I wasted my honeymoon being angry and apologizing to wedding guests. That is something money can never buy back. Bottom line: We paid for services that we did not receive.

I instantly fell in love with the venue with just the pictures I saw online. The beautiful grand staircase and private location, I literally would’ve booked even before physically ...

seeing it in person. Sure enough, on our first visit, I knew this place was special. But more importantly, your dream venue and wedding would never come to fruition without a hard working coordinator, and for us, that was Jennifer Franklin. She was always prompt to answer all the questions we had and made it clear that her role was to ensure our wishes for the wedding was executed. We highly recommend The club at Ruby Hill and wish we can go back and get married every year! Thank you Jennifer!!!!!
