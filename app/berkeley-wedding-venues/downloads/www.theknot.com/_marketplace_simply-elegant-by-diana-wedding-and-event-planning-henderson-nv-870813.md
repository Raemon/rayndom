Words can not express how much I love Diana and her team - but I will try. Planning a wedding is, I found out, a ton of work. So many details swirling around at all times and it'...

s a rough job seeing the forest through the trees sometimes. We hired Diana's team for the month leading up to our wedding and the day-of. WOW. Single-handedly the best decision we ever made. Diana's team is worth every penny and then some! She was proactive in jumping into the planning to see where things were at and she guided me through questions that either weren't yet answered or I didn't even know to ask. She made me feel like I was in good hands in the first 5 minutes of our first official planning call. You always hear stories about stressed out brides in the weeks leading up to their wedding, but I wasn't stressed AT ALL. Everything was handled well before the big day, and whatever needed to be worked out on the day-of? They handled everything. I got to relax and enjoy the moment. And that was highest quality service we got to experience. Can't thank Diana and her team enough. We're still riding high on cloud nine, weeks after. If you do nothing else for yourself in planning an event, HIRE THIS TEAM.

We hired Diana as a full-service wedding planner for our wedding at The Meritage Resort in September 2025. Diana was an AMAZING wedding planner!! I'll break my review up into two c...

omponents (plannings vs. day of), but our day could not have been more perfect or run more smoothly thanks to her and her team. Planning: From the start, we were impressed by Diana's organization and pragmatism. She has a great sense of what is "worth it" in terms of budget, and how to maximize impact for things like décor and flowers. This was extremely helpful, as we felt as though we were making good use of our budget, and were not pressured to overspend in any way. Choosing individual vendors was something that really overwhelmed me (there are so many great options!). Diana made this process seamless! At the start of our planning journey, we had a long discussion about what we were looking for in each vendor (e.g., photography style, entertainment type, floral colors, etc.) and our budget. She would send us 3-5 recommendations for each vendor and we would review and discuss. Obviously, if we wanted to see more options she would send them, but this really cut down on our stress and made this part of planning very straightforward. She also went through the entire design process with us, and put together a very detailed and helpful "mood board" that she shared with our florist, making that process super easy as well. Additionally, she was also extremely helpful in managing our vendors without letting us feel any stress. Our venue created some difficulties and could be frustrating to work with at times, and Diana did a TON of work in the background / back channeled with them to resolve any issues and keep things running smoothly. As we got closer to the day of, we had additional calls with her and all of our vendors to discuss the timeline. Diana created a VERY detailed, easy-to-follow timeline for the day before and day of. She also made a version for our families and bridal party that we could circulate. It was extremely helpful to have all of the timeline information in one place, and have the assurance that all of our vendors were on board with the timeline and could execute it easily. Day Of: Our day of could not have been better thanks to Diana and her team! They arrived early to the venue and ensured that everything was moving along with set up at the ceremony site and in the ballroom. My husband and I truly felt no stress the day of because we knew that all of the vendors were prepared and Diana was on it. We had a few timeline-related hiccups later in the day when our ceremony ran long (not Diana's fault!!) and she was quick to step in and make on-the-fly changes for the rest of the evening to make sure that things kept running smoothly. And the whole day was totally seamless as a result! All in all, I would wholeheartedly recommend Diana for any wedding or event planning. She was warm, kind, organized, and pragmatic, and my husband, both of our families, and I loved working with her. Could not recommend more!!

aged was Diana. From our initial consultation, she was everything I imagined, she is kind, professional, and so genuine. Talking to her felt like reconnecting with an old friend. After a year and a half of planning, Diana brought my dream wedding to life. My husband and I truly had the most magical day, everything ran flawlessly, and we were able to be fully present without a single worry. Diana and her incredible team made sure we were completely taken care of throughout the entire evening. It was an unforgettable day that exceeded every expectation. I can confidently say that Diana and her team are simply the best in the business. Their dedication, organization, and care made our wedding everything we dreamed of and more. I am forever grateful!

We cannot recommend Diana enough! She went above and beyond in every aspect of our wedding planning. We found her when we were 9-10 months out from our wedding date, and right away...

she made us feel at ease. Her bubbly energy was something we connected with right away, and knew she was the planner we needed. She helped us find a majority of our vendors, and created a timeline for all the steps that lead up to the wedding. She handled all of the vendor check ins during the wedding month, and had monthly and weekly calls with us to make sure we felt good and ready for everything. Our wedding day went off without a hitch and it’s all because of Diana and her team! They handled everything and made sure the day moved so smoothly, we got countless comments from friends and family saying she was the best wedding planner they’ve ever seen, and we completely agree. If you’re looking for an amazing wedding planner, look no further than Diana!

We worked with Diana for the past year and a half to plan our wedding, and our experience with her and her team was unmatched. I was overwhelmed with the wedding planning process a...

nd knew I needed help to pull off our ideas for the day. She understood my vision immediately and worked with us to find the perfect vendors, give us ideas, and keep us reassured throughout the entire process. Our wedding was based in San Francisco, with a church ceremony in the city and our reception on Treasure Island. When I mentioned an idea to Diana that we could ferry the guests across the Bay instead of using shuttles, she didn’t bat an eye. She reached out to all sorts of boat companies and we landed on the perfect transportation solution for our goals and our budget. The day, though logistically challenging, felt seamless. As a very organized person myself, I often find it difficult to relax when we’re on a tight schedule; but that day, I felt so much at ease and incredibly supported the entire day knowing that Diana and her team had the details covered. When we arrived at the reception, the venue had been transformed by her team and our vendors. It was well beyond my expectations and even my original vision. Our decorations, food, DJ/Band hybrid, gelato and coffee bars were amazing; but just as equally amazing were the small details – the guests’ table settings, photo and welcome tables were set up perfectly. Diana and her team made sure we got a chance to try all our appetizers and stuck to our timeline without it feeling too structured or like we were pulled in too many directions. Overall, this was truly the best day, and I’m so grateful for Diana and her team that made it so. Our guests are still telling us that this was the best wedding they had ever been to, complimenting every single aspect of it – and we owe that all to Diana. We couldn’t have done it without her! I highly recommend her as a planner who is willing to take on every challenge and execute perfectly.

atting all things wedding even before contracting her team. Diana and her team were absolutely amazing and supported my now husband and I in so many ways with our month of wedding planning and day of coordination. From listing out decor, wedding day logistics questionnaires, vendor coordination, pre wedding meetings to ease the nerves, and setting us up for success for our special day. Our wedding came together so gracefully and that couldn't have been without the hard work and love put in by Diana and her team. Even when there were some bumps in the road, everything was handled and Diana and team kept our minds at ease so we could enjoy our event with our family and friends. I am so happy to have worked with the fabulous crew from Simply Elegant and would 1000% hire for future events. Thank you so much for everything! Photo Credits : Khariza Rae Photography

Disappointed is best way to capture my sentiment on hiring Diana and her team. She was the vendor I was hoping would shine the day of and she failed to deliver. My daughter and he...

r fiance wanted a vibe for their wedding and not a “show”. We hired Diana for the month of coordination and I guess because we didn't fit into her Instagram worthy event we received subpar service. As a female small business owner I love supporting self made women and their teams. I dislike leaving bad reviews but I don't want others to experience what I did for my only daughter. Working with Diana, it seemed as if we were always low priority. My niece was an event planner in LA and did red carpet and big events, and her comment after Diana and her helper failed to remind my daughter to grab her wedding bouquet to walk down the aisle.…..How does that happen? Exactly, I can let many small things go, but when you fail to remind my daughter to get her bouquet….WTF? You were supposed to handle the details the day of, and you did not as you were too busy thinking and planning for your Instagram events. My husband mentioned we needed drink restocking and you said we were fine; No we were not. We ran out of drinks and found 40 percent of them in our second fridge. Calling the buses to come up to transport guests to reception….I had to do that along with another family member. The fails are many. My family thought I bought the discount planner….not true at all. I hired the one who shouldn't have taken us on as we did not seem to fit her “Brand style or Instagram Style”. I would not recommend Diana and her team if you want service that is five stars. You get one star for showing up, D for assistance the month and F for execution and delivery the day of. All our vendors were great, except our month of wedding coordinator.

Response from Simply Elegant By Diana (Wedding & Event Planning) on 11/14/2024

Dear Josie, We appreciate your review of our services for your daughter’s wedding, and I ...

understand that you were disappointed with your overall experience. For that, I am truly sorry for any miscommunication on our end or unmet expectations you had of us. Transparency is a priority for me, and I would like to provide some context, as this review doesn’t entirely reflect the experience or feedback we received from your daughter and her fiance on their wedding day. The event was filled with positive interactions, a well-coordinated timeline, and careful attention to detail. Most importantly, our bride and groom expressed their happiness with how their special day unfolded. I worked closely with your daughter and her fiance throughout the planning process, including regular meetings and a lovely site visit with you as well. I understand that weddings can be intense and complex events, with each family bringing its own perspective, and I strive to create a seamless and enjoyable experience for everyone involved. Our goal is always to deliver excellence, and my team and I take pride in our clients’ joy and satisfaction. Which leads me to my own disappointment in hearing about your experience - the frustrations that were shared are disheartening and not reflective of our mission to always prioritize our clients’ needs first. As is standard protocol, I made an effort to check in throughout the day and ensure everything was running smoothly. If there were issues that were causing distress, they weren’t communicated or made known to me or my assistant on the day of. I wish we could have alleviated any stress you were experiencing or concerns you may have had at your daughter’s wedding so that your day could have been stress-free and more enjoyable. We can admit and take responsibility for any mistakes, and it was an oversight that our bride’s bouquet was left behind. Although my assistant noticed the bouquet was not with the bride before the processional started, in the heat of the moment, our bride started her processional before it could be retrieved. However, she had her bouquet in hand by the end of the ceremony. Regarding the restocking of drinks, our role as coordinators typically does not include bartending services. While we did assist with initial welcome drink setup when a designated family member didn’t cover this duty as planned — ensuring water and canned champagne were fully stocked at the ceremony location — our focus had to shift to other critical tasks. I departed to a separate reception venue to arrange all the decor, while my assistant stayed behind to help bustle the bride’s dress, which required significant time and attention. We regret that we couldn't manage restocking during this transition, but our priorities were aligned with taking care of the couple’s immediate needs, ensuring the overall flow of the event, and preparing the reception space as planned, where there was a full bar and catering staff that took care of drinks for guests for the rest of the evening. Regarding the bus transportation, I want to clarify that I maintained clear and consistent communication with the shuttle service throughout the event. I provided detailed instructions for the buses to be ready at the house by 4:30 PM and to arrive at the venue at 5 PM, and I stayed in direct contact with the drivers to ensure everything went according to plan. I have documented these communications, and while I do not typically involve the couple in these logistics to minimize their stress, this does not mean communication was lacking. I understand that this may not have been evident, but rest assured, the transportation details were managed with care. We deeply understand the significance of every detail on such an important day, and we always welcome constructive feedback that can help improve our services. Again, Josie, we are sorry to hear that your experience did not align with the standards we hold ourselves to, and we have taken this experience as a learning opportunity for our team.

Diana was INCREDIBLE to work with throughout my wedding planning journey. I opted for the full planner package and highly recommend it. We had numerous video chats and in-person me...

etings to refine the vision and coordinate with vendors, bringing the event to life. Diana's insightful questions and extensive experience guided me every step of the way, all while maintaining a high level of professionalism. Where Diana truly shined was during the month leading up to the wedding. With a lot on my plate, both personally and professionally, she took charge of final vendor communications and ensured every detail was in place. Diana helped plan two key events: the welcome party (rehearsal dinner) and the wedding day itself. For day-of coordination, her team handled the welcome party, while Diana personally oversaw the wedding. The wedding day went smoothly but a few unforeseen issues arose during the welcome party—like delays in dinner service, sound system mishaps, and situational challenges. These were mainly due to unfortunate circumstances rather than any fault of Diana's team, but there was a brief scramble, with guests stepping in to help. My tip is to discuss potential challenges and contingency plans in advance, so you can arrange for extra support to assist with tasks like moving chairs and tables if needed. The wedding day was MAGICAL, and Diana and her team excelled in managing any hiccups, ensuring everything ran smoothly. SO many guests commented on how much fun they had, and much of that credit goes to Diana's work to bring my vision to life and execute things so wonderfully. THANK YOU!

My son and his fiance selected Simply Elegant by Diana less than a year from the anticipated wedding. She carefully worked with them to identify the type of venue that would meet ...

their needs and then helped them select Yin Ranch. She kept them on task giving them wonderful guidance, suggestions and introducing them to fantastic vendors such as Blooms by Sirce, Blurred Line Photography and Jacqueline Banuelos (make up and hair) the DJ, who I only know as Chris was also over the top keeping everyone on the dance floor to the last minute! Finally, the big day came, May 6, 2023 and I cannot tell you how perfectly everything went. Diana was on point beginning with the rehearsal, set up, the ceremony, cocktail hour, reception...She and her excellent team kept everything going even when 2 hired servers did not show up. We, including the bride and groom, had no idea! Diana and her fabulous team kept things going without a glitch. AMAZING does not really say enough. Diana made planning a wedding from Seattle, WA that took place in Vacaville, CA seem easy peasy. Every vendor she identified and ultimately was selected were professional, caring, fun, lovely people who made the day extraordinary. I would highly, highly recommend Diana and her team!

On the day of, Helen and Nalee helped organize all of our decor, making sure everything was set up in the correct place. They helped with queueing the various audio/visual elements like our processional/recessional songs, cocktail hour playlist, and slideshow during dinner. At the end of the night, they helped us break down the decor and put it all together where we could pack it into our vehicles. Having their help really took a lot of stress and anxiety away from our wedding day. Knowing that they were going to handle any issues that came up was a great relief, and it allowed us to focus on enjoying our day with friends and family.

The vendors list they provide offer their services at below market price, so I saved big money on everyone from the photographer, to the choreographer, to DJ! So you might as well hire them, otherwise you will end up spending more on your event without them.

a great party planner. If you are considering hiring a wedding planner, hire Diana and her team! We decided on the 4 weeks of Wedding Management package. I researched our venue and saw that she had planned several weddings at our specific venue, that was instrumental. I wanted to be sure to find someone that had an idea of all the logistical issues that could arise. I contacted her and we set up a meeting. During our official meeting I knew she was the one for me. Her outgoing personality just gave me the reassurance I needed that I was going to be supported by a confident professional, she knows all things wedding. Every question that arose she had an answer or she would get back to me with one, in a timely manner. Her and her team provided me with many resources from vendor recommendations, spreadsheets and checklist. We did not hear about one problem during our wedding, not one. That’s HUGE! Diana and her assistant collaborated with all vendors. She created a detailed wedding day timeline and floorplan that was sensational, we were so impressed. Unfortunately, my lead staff did not show up on our big day. Diana stepped in and assisted which was not part of her scope of work. She went above and beyond to make sure everything was taken care of. She solved problems and made proper adjustments through the wedding planning process. She made sure that my husband, wedding party, wedding guest and I had the best time and she succeeded. Thank you Diana!

celebrating with our guests. Since the very first phone call meeting we had with Diana no matter our connection issues and the call dropping a few times we automatically felt her genuine vibe as well we her charming personality and we knew she was the perfect fit for us to help us execute our special day to perfection. Working with Diana one month prior to our wedding day was incredible she was on top of everything reaching out to our event vendors and making sure the program was going to run smoothly taking a lot of task off our plate. Her great skills in making sure everything was organized made sure our big day was definitely a dream come true. On the event day Diana and Anaí were extremely helpful and very professional from the start helping organize our court to making sure they had their bouquet and boutonnières prior to the ceremony. Throughout the event day we had a couple of last minute inevitable changes due to the strong winds and they both made sure the event kept running smoothly with no disruptions making sure me and my husband were well taking care of and not stressed about anything our cake even fell due to the winds fault and it was saved and when it was time for cutting if it wasn’t for Diana informing us we would of never known. I really appreciate Diana and Anaí for all their dedication and great work that day making sure there were no delays in the time line and that we danced all night until our feet hurt. I highly recommend Diana and her staff if you want to enjoy your special moments and make sure everything turns out even better than planned.
