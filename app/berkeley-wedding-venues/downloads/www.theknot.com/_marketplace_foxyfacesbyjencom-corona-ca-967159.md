Jen

Owner

Hi there, I'm Jen, the owner and "Glam Team Coordinator" for Foxy Faces by Jen. Just a little bit about myself, I'm a makeup artist, wifey and mommy all wrapped into one. What was once a hobbie for me has now become a full time job and I couldn't have asked for more. I absolutely love what I do and I am proud of the awesome team that works with me. Without my team, Foxy Faces would not be what it is today. We've glammed up hundreds of brides (literally) and this has given us the experience and expertise needed to make our clients look gorgeous on the most important day of their life.

hair and makeup artist, Amanda, was fantastic. She not only did an amazing job on the day of but also made sure I was totally comfortable with the look during the trial. I wanted a very natural makeup look, and Amanda delivered perfectly—she was so receptive to my feedback and ensured that I was happy every step of the way. Her attention to detail and calm, professional demeanor made the whole experience stress-free and enjoyable. Alix and Pratixa, the other stylists, were also wonderful! They worked seamlessly with Amanda, and everyone was thrilled with their hair and makeup. My bridesmaids were glowing, and I could tell they felt amazing in their looks, which was exactly what I wanted for the big day. Jen and her team were punctual, organized, and so kind—it was such a pleasure having them be a part of our wedding. I wholeheartedly recommend Foxy Faces by Jen for anyone looking for talented, professional, and truly caring hair and makeup artists!

I would highly recommend both Jen and Alexandria for any and all events where you’d like your makeup professionally done.

My makeup was flawless and my braided up-do held for two days! | chose not to have a trial for myself or my mother. My mother's makeup was age appropriate and really brought out her best features. Her hair had SO much volume, but looked amazing! Gabriela went ABOVE AND BEYOND for me and my littles. the flower girls had crowns that needed to be attached and also the ring bearer needed hair product and she saved the day! She was efficient, professional, friendly, and very skilled at what she does. I am SOOOO happy with the service and professionalism, and I would definitely recommend 10/10!!

Working with Jen and her team was a very enjoyable experience! I know that hiring so many vendors can be stressful, believe me, this is the one decision was the absolute best one....

Communication was great and all questions answered appropriately. Working with Amanda (Make Up Artist) and Chantelle (Hair Stylist), I had no doubts that my bridal squad (and mom) would look flawless, gorgeous, and polished. After a trial, I had complete peace of mind with my look and was able to add a few details the day of that worked perfectly. The professionalism, skill, attention to detail, as well as kind and genuine nature of these women made my morning fun and the few nerves I had- calmed. Hair and make up held up into the night with all the dancing and running around!! Don’t over-think this one, working with Jen and her team definitely made my wedding even more fabulous. Thank you Amanda and Chantelle ❤️!

I recently got married in September and reached out to Jen initially to do the makeup of my bridesmaids. After my own makeup trial, I was unpleased with the artist I chose for myse...

lf and reached out Jen to see if she could assist me with my makeup. She was kind enough to offer another makeup artist to allow for all of my group to get makeup with Foxy Faces, which was to my relief. I really appreciated that despite having a business with many artists I was able to meet with and have a trial with the artist I would be working with. I immediately clicked with Amanda as she was doing my hair and makeup and loved how the makeup came out. My hair also turned out lovely but was a bit looser than I liked (thank goodness for trials). It was very easy to communicate my needs to Amanda and she was attentive and did her best to make my vision a reality. There were a few mishaps on my wedding morning- missing the alarm clock to allow the artists in, a last minute family member requesting assistance with eyelashes- but the Foxy Faces Team remained professional, organized and overly accommodating. Me and my bridal party looked like angels and our makeup lasted the whole day through to the late evening. I cannot thank the Foxy Faces team enough for allowing me to feel like a queen on my wedding day.

I absolutely loved how my hair/makeup and how my bridesmaids hair/makeup turned out for my wedding day! The makeup artist who was originally supposed to do my makeup had to cancel ...

and they put me with a new person so I got another makeup trial. I actually ended up completely switching the look I was originally going for and she encouraged me to go for a Hollywood waves hairstyle look. I was absolutely obsessed with how it turned out and I never would’ve taken that risk without her encouragement/showing me the wonderful work that my hairstylist (Biany) did! I am so glad I went with the foxy faces team!!

ely had a busy day doing my hair/makeup, plus hair/makeup for my 6 bridesmaids, and my mom! They were total pros and stayed on track all afternoon to have us done by 4pm. My bridesmaids and mom were totally thrilled with their hair/makeup. The team listened to what they wanted and did a great job executing their vision. For my hair and makeup, I already knew my artist, Monique, was going to do an amazing job based on the trial we did back in August but I was absolutely blown away by the job she did on my wedding day. I’m so happy I followed Monique’s advice and got clip in extensions. It made my hairstyle look extra dreamy and so beautiful. I got so many compliments throughout the evening and after. Her makeup artistry made me feel so confident on my special day and my makeup and hair stayed intact the whole night, even after an hour on the dance floor! Thank you so much! I’m so glad I chose the Foxy Faces team to be part of my wedding day. I’ll definitely be recommending you guys to any of my friends getting married in the future!

It is with a heavy heart that I write this review. I’m not one to normally write reviews but I was so surprised that I felt I should share this information with prospective brides....

This was in the Bay Area, so I cant speak for the artists/stylists in Southern California. I will state that overall, we looked beautiful and we’re ahead of schedule—big and important factors. However, we were so ahead of schedule that we were a little whiplashed—we’d plan to eat lunch etc at certain times. Additionally, we had scheduled touch ups from Jen at 2:30pm—right before photos were taken but they were off and gone and did not do touch ups before they left. Two of my bridesmaids false eye lashes came off later—they had requested for them to be put on more securely and they did not assist. They also made comments about rushing to get to a niece’s birthday, and even called my bridesmaid’s hair dirty on multiple occasions. Additionally my hair was not what I had asked for. I heard the hair stylist make a comment that my hair was too thin to do what I wanted when a makeup artist asked, but there was no communication with me until it was done that that was the case. I understand that this is a job for them and not an important day for them—but we did not feel like we were treated with kindness and we’re just an annoying task for them to complete. I was surprised to see many 5 star reviews after the way were treated.

Congratulations on your marriage and thank you for sharing your thoughts. As a beauty team...

we have a great responsibility to have everyone ready on time and looking beautiful. I’m glad you agree that you “all looked beautiful and were ready ahead of schedule.” A trial is very important. During the trial you’re able to discuss the hair and makeup look and make adjustments where needed. I understand weddings are expensive and a trial may not have been in the budget however, it’s best to address any dislikes before the big day. Trials allow us to change a style to something more suitable for your hair type if you don’t like how it turned out. Pictures are used for inspirational purposes only. Everyone is unique and we cannot guarantee your hairstyle will turn out exactly as shown in photo. We calculate 45 - 50 min per service which is the average time we need per person. Your bridal party in particular did not want any eyeliner or much makeup at all, we also had 1 hair & makeup cancellation so all this put us ahead of schedule. We kindly ask ahead of time that everyone’s hair be clean and completely dry otherwise oily hair will not hold or style well and this falls back on us. However, we have no problem applying dry shampoo in this type of situation. False eyelashes are included in all makeup services and they are glued on and secured to last all day. Our makeup artist’s are always willing to assist with anything that is asked of them. I’m very sorry you didn’t feel our team provided the customer service you so much deserve. I understand this was a huge day for you and your opinion matters to us. Please reply to my email and let me know if there is anything I can do to compensate. Best, Jen
