I cannot express how absolutely thrilled I was with the stunning floral arrangements provided by Bloom Gallery for my wedding. From the moment I spoke with Anastasiya, I knew I was...

in good hands. Her and her team’s attention to detail, creativity, and genuine passion for their craft were evident in every aspect of the planning process. On the day of the wedding, the floral arrangements were stunning. The colors, textures, and variety were absolutely perfect and complemented the entire aesthetic of the wedding. Every bouquet, boutonniere, and centerpiece was carefully crafted with the utmost care and attention to detail. Anastasiya truly went above and beyond to ensure that every aspect of the floral design was tailored to our specific needs and preferences. Her unique floral choices elevated the feel of our whole wedding. Anastasiya was an absolute pleasure to work with. She was professional, kind, and went out of her way to make sure that every aspect of the floral design process was stress-free and enjoyable. She worked with our budget to help our dream day look perfect. Anastasiya listened to our vision and made it a reality, and for that, we are forever grateful. I would highly recommend Bloom Gallery to any bride or groom looking for a wedding florist. Their talent, professionalism, and dedication to their craft are unmatched, and I am confident that they will exceed all of your expectations. Thank you, Anastasiya, for making our wedding day even more beautiful than we ever could have imagined!

o many vendors I found Bloom Gallery Flowers. Since our first meeting we knew that we had found the one! Anastasiya is honestly one of the kindest people I know. She was extremely patient with me throughout the whole process when I changed the color palette 700 times. In fact, she helped us creating the vision we wanted for the wedding. At our first visit to the venue, she knew exactly what we were looking for and made it even better. It was so fun to work together. The flowers on our wedding day were simply ASTONISHING. We (and all of our guests) were blown away by her and her teams work. The flowers were super fresh, the arrangements were just perfect. I wish I could go back just to be able to stop for a moment and take it all in. It was a dream wedding for us and it would not be the same without Bloom! Thank you for literally making our wishes come true!

Finding a florist may be one of the hardest task in wedding planning, especially when you don't have the most complete vision in floral design for your own wedding, can only name a...

nd recognize limited kinds of flowers, AND have a certain level of budget in mind. Anastasiya, however, made all of the above go away for us. She was flexible in customizing what our needs are for our wedding floral decor and design (centerpieces, candles, etc). She also puts together a moodboard for us - in which she laid down her design ideas she brought back from the trip she made to our venue. Anastasiya also communicated with us, and tried to grasp what kind of flowers and design may be of our taste. Anastasiya and the whole team at Bloom Gallery are such a fantastic team. On our wedding day, we were awed by what her and her team had put together for us, and we absolutely loved it! We really cannot thank her enough for all of her dedication and care she had put into our wedding. Many of my friends had shared with us afterwards that they were amazed by how fast their team took apart the flowers and assembled them into small bouquets for them. My friends loved it so much and felt really special to be able to take that home with them! It's all these little things that add up together, along with the beautiful flowers that really complete the story of our wedding day! Anastasiya is also very sweet and kind in person :)

than I had expected - until I found Bloom Gallery Flowers! Anastasiya was lovely to work with, and took great care to make sure she got every detail the way I wanted it. She was also good to communicate with me about what could be done, what could be attempted but not guaranteed, etc. It was so nice to work with her, and I felt excited to see how everything would look. When the big day came, we were so impressed with the wonderful work Anastasiya and her team did for us! They were very professional and went above and beyond to provide amazing florals and decor - even down to little details such as providing vases for the bouquets to sit in during the reception. They provided everything we had discussed, and the flowers were SO beautiful! I was so happy that I had found Bloom Gallery Flowers, and so glad they helped to make our dreams come true that special day!
