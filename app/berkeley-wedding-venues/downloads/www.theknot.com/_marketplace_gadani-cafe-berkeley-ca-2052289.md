Please hire Gadani for your wedding if you're looking for a unique and delicious dessert option for your guests besides cake!! My (now) husband and I worked with Gadani as our des...

sert vendor for our wedding in July at Palm Event Center in Pleasanton. We found Gadani from a Facebook recommendation, and Maegan was quick to reply to my inquiry with prices and options. I was able to customize the package to fit my wedding needs better as well, which was great! Pricing was also fair and affordable imo when compared to other dessert vendors for weddings. Maegan invited my fiance and I over to their shop for a complimentary tasting as well so we could decide if using their services would be something we wanted. We were able to try out all the different ice cream and waffle flavors, which were fantastic! The waffle was nice and chewy, and the ice cream flavors were rich/flavorful. Our guests absolutely loved the dessert and they were beyond excited we had this option for our summer wedding! We were able to have 4 ice cream flavors, 2 waffle flavors, and 4 different toppings for guests to choose from. Guests could also opt out of the waffle if they just wanted ice cream. Maegan, Lena, and the rest of the Gadani team were so kind, sweet, and professional during our wedding. My partner and I are SO GLAD we went with Gadani as our dessert vendor. The girls were so sweet and such a joy to work with!! They even gave us a little wedding gift at the end of the night, which was honestly so thoughtful!! (Sorry I don't have any photos to post from my wedding yet, but we enjoyed working with you guys so much!!) We'll be back to Gadani to visit and eat some more delicious bubble waffle ice cream again! :)
