# TKWW AI Terms

Updated December 18, 2025

These AI Terms (“AI Terms”) apply when you use any AI features of The Knot Worldwide (“TKWW”), including, but not limited to, an AI feature designed to assist you in planning your wedding (“Features”). The AI Terms incorporate by reference and supplement our [Terms of Use](https://www.theknotww.com/terms-of-use/), [Usage Policy](/marketplace/ai-usage-policy), and other documentation, guidelines, or policies we may provide in writing (collectively “Terms”). By using our Features, you agree to these Terms. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein have the meanings assigned to them in the [Terms of Use](https://www.theknotww.com/terms-of-use/). Our [Privacy Policy](https://www.theknotww.com/privacy-policy/) explains how we collect and use personal information.

  1. Use Requirements and Restrictions

     1. Use of Services. You may access, and we grant you a non-exclusive right to use the Features according to the Terms. You will comply with the Terms and all applicable laws when using the Features. We may modify, suspend, or terminate your access to the Features at any time for any reason including, but not limited to, safety, legal, quality, or operational reasons.
     2. Restrictions. You may not (i) use the Features in a way that infringes, misappropriates or violates any person’s rights; (ii) reverse assemble, reverse compile, decompile, translate or otherwise attempt to discover the underlying components of the Features (except to the extent such restrictions are contrary to applicable law); (iii) use output from the Features to develop models that compete with TKWW; (iv) use any automated or programmatic method to extract data or output from the Features, including scraping, web harvesting, or web data extraction; (v) use the Features to promote spamming, chain letters, or other unsolicited communications; or (vi) represent that the output from the Features was human-generated when it is not or otherwise violates our Usage Policy.
     3. Third Party Services. Any third party software, services, or other products you use in connection with the Features are subject to their own terms, and we are not responsible for third party products.
  2. Feedback

You have no obligation to provide us with feedback, ideas, suggestions, comments or proposals for improvements (“Feedback”). However, if you submit Feedback to us, then you grant us an exclusive, worldwide, irrevocable, royalty-free license that is sub-licensable, and transferable, to make, use, sell, have made, offer to sell, import, reproduce, publicly display, distribute, modify, or publicly perform the Feedback in any manner without any obligation, royalty or restriction based on intellectual property rights or otherwise.

  3. Ownership and Content

     1. Content. The input is all information, text, prompts, or data you provide to the Features (“Input”). The output is all responses, content, text, or suggestion generated and returned by the Features based on the Input (“Output”). Input and Output are collectively “Content.”
     2. Ownership. As between you and TKWW and to the extent permitted by applicable law, you own all rights, title and interest to the Input and TKWW owns all rights, title, and interest to the Outputs and Features.
     3. Rights. We grant to you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use the Output in connection with the Features or the Services. You grant, and you represent and warrant that you have the right to grant to us, an irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive, transferable, fully-paid-up, royalty-free, worldwide license (with the right to sublicense at multiple levels to anyone, including but not limited to, our affiliates and third parties) to use, copy, publicly perform, publicly display, reformat, translate, excerpt (in whole or in part), and distribute such Input for any purpose and in any format on or in connection with the Services, our business, or the promotion thereof, to prepare derivative works of, or incorporate such Inputs into other works, and to grant and authorize sublicenses of the foregoing.
     4. Responsibility. You are responsible for the Content, including for ensuring that it does not violate any applicable law or the Terms. In the case that the Content is deemed as Personal Identifiable Information TKWW will process the content according to its Privacy Policy.
     5. Similarity of Content. Due to the nature of machine learning, the Output may not be unique across users and the Features may generate the same or similar output for you as it does other users.
     6. Accuracy. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are rapidly evolving fields of study. We are constantly working to improve our Features to make them more accurate, reliable, safe, and beneficial. Given the probabilistic nature of machine learning, use of our Features may in some situations result in incorrect Output that does not accurately reflect real people, places, or facts. You should evaluate the accuracy of any Output as appropriate for your use case, including by using human review of the Output.
  4. Data Usage and Storage 

     1. Data Usage
        1. Use. TKWW may use the Content to provide, maintain, train and improve the Features and/or the Services, provide new features and services, comply with applicable laws, and enforce our policies. We do not share the Content with third parties for the purposes of model training or for unrelated uses outside of providing the Service.
        2. Monitoring. TKWW may monitor your use of the Features for quality, safety, abuse, and compliance purposes.
        3. Memory. The Features may have a memory feature that stores the Content to personalize future interactions and improve your experience with the Services. You can disable the memory features by adjusting your settings. Disabling memory will not necessarily remove previously stored Content unless you request deletion according to our Privacy Policy.
     2. Data Storage. In the case that the Content is deemed as Personal Identifiable Information TKWW will store the Content according to our Privacy Policy.
