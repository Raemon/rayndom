## Trending Beach Bachelorette Themes

There's so much to love about the water, whether it's an ocean, lake or pool. It relaxes people, is loads of fun and gives a lot of inspiration for fun [bachelorette party themes](https://www.theknot.com/content/bachelorette-party-themes)! Here are some of the best.

**Beach bachelorette themes:** Seashells & Wedding Bells | Last Toast on the Coast | Mermaids and Matrimony | Last Splash | Aloha Beaches | The Summer I Turned Married | Coastal Cowgirl | She's a Catch | Bikinis and Martinis | Something Blue Before I Do




### 1\. Seashells & Wedding Bells Bachelorette Party

If you're heading to the beach to celebrate, there are hopefully going to be seashells! A cute, relaxed and easy beach bachelorette theme, seashells and wedding bells are understandably popular. The party host can collect plenty of decorations right from the shore, making this a budget-friendly option too. Add banners with bells and you've got all the decor you need. 

This theme can also be combined with any ocean-related ideas, such as waves, mermaids or something blue, if you're looking for a little more pizazz. As you plan the getaway, reserve some time to create seashell-inspired art, walk and look for shells at popular beaches or play a game of Pin the Shell on the Fiancé. Grab seashell stickers, a blindfold and a large picture of the to-be-wed's fiancé and you're on your way to some laughs.

### 2\. Last Toast on the Coast Bachelorette Party

Grab the bubbly and head to the coast for this bachelorette party beach theme. While most people typically think of toasting with a drink, feel free to think outside the box. Plan a brunch with mimosas—but also serve French toast. Bring out all the toppings (chocolate, whipped cream, fresh fruit and sprinkles!) to celebrate.

As there will be plenty of toasting on a weekend like this, consider personalizing champagne glasses for everyone as a favor or putting together a little hangover cure bag for the final morning. In your weekend itinerary, include a scavenger hunt, beach volleyball or even a day out on the ocean whalewatching, tubing or water skiing.

### 3\. Mermaids and Matrimony Bachelorette Party

If the bride-to-be loves the ocean, she might have had dreams of being a mermaid when she was a little girl. Make those dreams come true during her beach-themed bachelorette. Kick off the weekend with some beach bachelorette party games like Mermaids and Matrimony Jeopardy or sign up for a class on how to swim in a mermaid tail (yes, that's a real thing!). 

Make sure to get everyone matching mermaid [bachelorette party shirts](https://www.theknot.com/content/bachelorette-party-shirts), then cozy up for a movie night with a viewing of _The Little Mermaid_ or Disney originals like _Splash_ and _The Thirteenth Year._ Lastly, let the party goers know the color scheme of the [mermaid bachelorette party](https://www.theknot.com/content/mermaid-bachelorette-party) ahead of time, so the group pictures will be a splash of blue, green and purple.

### 4\. Last Splash Bachelorette Party

If you're throwing a party with a last splash theme, it could take place at any [beach bachelorette destination](https://www.theknot.com/content/bachelorette-beach-destinations). From a pool or tropical island to a lake or beach, any spot with water will work. Many people incorporate mermaids into this party theme, although it doesn't necessarily need that. 

As the name itself speaks to getting in the water, grab some fun pool floaties for decor—and lounging around—and personalized towels for everyone. For fun drinks, make blue Jello shots with peach ring floaties or personalize drink pouches for those days by the pool where you can't have a glass.

### 5\. Aloha Beaches Bachelorette Party

Heading to Hawaii or just want to pretend you're on the islands? Throw a luau for the to-be-wed and welcome them with an aloha. Lean into all the bright colors here, from leis and coconuts to sparkling pineapples and hibiscus flowers—nothing fun or spunky is off limits. 

From plenty of fresh fruit and drinks to serving up a pig roast or Hawaii-style plate lunch, there's plenty of delicious food to choose from with an aloha theme. Plus, it's generic enough to include a variety of other [bachelorette party trends](https://www.theknot.com/content/bachelorette-party-statistics), too. If you need some low-key, relaxing things to do, set up a lei-making station, host a ukulele jam session or paint your own floral Hawaiian-style shirts.

### 6\. The Summer I Turned Married Bachelorette Party

Anyone who loves Jenny Han's _The Summer I Turned Pretty_ book or the show on Amazon Prime would adore a Cousins Beach-themed bachelorette. Rent a beach house to match the brothers' and go out for a night on the town just like Belly. 

Showcase the best parts from the show, like Belly's florals and hurricane vases, to planning a little dance party on the beach to end the night. Compete to see who knows the most about the show—and the bride-to-be—during a fun quiz show or binge the series over the weekend. Either way, it's exciting that this is the summer when someone turns married.

### 7\. Coastal Cowgirl Bachelorette Party

Giddy up, folks! This beach-themed bachelorette party takes her last rodeo to the water. Coastal cowgirls can bring their white boots, hats and belt buckles for a night of line dancing and fun or opt for a more toned-down weekend of lying on the beach and riding horses on the sand. 

A coastal cowgirl theme is broad enough to include plenty of different activities, from cornhole by the house or a private dance class. Keep things upbeat with things like a neon "Yeehaw" sign, cowboy boot shot glasses and matching bucket hats.

### 8\. She's a Catch Bachelorette Party

Are the nearlyweds into fishing or hoping for a beach at the lake? A she's a catch theme is just what you need. Get inspired with New England lobster designs or opt for a more [nautical bachelorette party](https://www.theknot.com/content/nautical-bachelorette-party) with fishing nets, tackle boxes and a few canoes by the water. Make the decor pop by using blues, turquoise and white, incorporating textures through seashells, nautical rope and breezy fabric. 

Depending on the weekend's itinerary, include some personalized hats, towels or koozies for the partygoers, ensuring they feel appreciated for coming along and prepared for whatever's in store. Whether the party is fishing, boating, eating all-you-can-eat lobster or just lying in the sand, remember the point of any of our beach bachelorette party themes is to celebrate the to-be-wed.

### 9\. Bikinis and Martinis Bachelorette Party

Matching bikinis? Check. Martini glasses? Check. Bachelorette party? Ready to go. This is one of the most versatile bachelorette party theme names because it can truly take place anywhere you can don a swimsuit. From a resort pool to a lakehouse or an oceanside campsite, this coastal bachelorette theme will come to life pretty easily.

Obviously, bikinis are mandatory; there's plenty of space to play when it comes to martinis to have on hand. Grab olives to snack on and wow everyone with a martini pyramid right as they arrive. Have a few different recipes ready to mix up to ensure there's a drink for everyone, and get to sipping. Send guests off with personalized [beach bachelorette party favors](https://www.theknot.com/content/beach-bachelorette-party-favors) and you're all set.

### 10\. Something Blue Before I Do Bachelorette Party

Having something blue when you walk down the aisle is a time-honored tradition, but who says you can't get that blue from the ocean beforehand? Head to the water for this tropical bachelorette party theme. Incorporate as much or as little ocean-inspired decor and activities as you want, just make sure it all revolves around the color blue! 

Spice up the drinks with blue glitter bombs and add blue fringe to everything to be just perfectly over the top. Trips to the beach, boardwalk or on the water in a boat are all fair game here. To help prepare, consider personalizing hats, sunscreen or bathing suits so everyone is matching and on-theme.

## Beach-Themed Bachelorette Ideas to Recreate

When it comes to beach [bachelorette party ideas](https://www.theknot.com/content/new-bachelorette-party-ideas), there are so many to explore. From tiki lounges and setting sail to cozy bonfires and margaritas, any bride will be impressed when her friends pull off even a few of these. Here are some of our favorites you can recreate.

### 1\. Cool Off With Shaved Ice

![Shaved ice for beach bachelorette](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/44f5f60c-b3b0-42a8-a6c9-2e8cd0a1533b~rs_768.h-cr_0.1291.2581.3872)

Whether there's a good spot in town or a shaved ice truck willing to swing by your party, there's nothing better than a cold, refreshing treat on a hot day. If you make them yourselves, take them to the next level and make them boozy.

### 2\. Picnic on the Beach

![Beach picnic for bachelorette](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/8913aee0-fdba-4ace-9d2e-8ffbea44f634~rs_768.h-cr_0.52.784.1097)

Load up the basket, grab some blankets and head to the beach for a picnic. Bring fresh fruit, charcuterie, mimosas or any of the to-be-wed's favorite snacks and enjoy a sunrise or sunset together.

### 3\. Carved Coconut Cocktails

We love any [bachelorette party decorations](https://www.theknot.com/content/bachelorette-bridal-shower-decor) that have a dual purpose! While these coconut cups are absolutely adorable just sitting around, stir up some cocktails in them, too. Piña coladas, mai tai or a margarita—mix up your favorite and give a cheer for the nearlyweds. 

### 4\. Oceanside Yoga

If you need to take a break from [bachelorette party games](https://www.theknot.com/content/bachelorette-party-game-ideas), slow down with some yoga in the sand. While you can often find classes near you, pay an instructor for a private session with the bachelorette attendees to ensure everyone feels relaxed for the big day.

### 5\. Pedal Up the Coast

![Pedal up the coast beach bachelorette idea](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/80fdcb57-cec4-4a72-b931-0690bfc5075e~rs_768.h-cr_0.52.784.1097)

_Photo: The Happy Bloom_

Rent bikes for a breezy zip along the ocean. Pick a special destination like a restaurant, lighthouse or picture-perfect cliffs for a sweet break before heading back.

### 6\. Bridal Beach Photoshoot

![Bridal beach photoshoot bachelorette idea](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/9c24ceee-db26-4d82-b060-0e40bd226d1a~rs_768.h-cr_0.52.784.1097)

_Photo: Louis Fort_

If the bride-to-be loves being the center of attention, set up a beach bridal photoshoot. Bring all the sexy, ocean-inspired outfits, add a few beach bachelorette decorations to the scene and let the ocean light capture all her best angles.

### 7\. A Stay at the Seaside Spa

![Seaside spa bachelorette idea](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/4de854dd-64fe-4b6c-b1ab-59160b2d903c~rs_768.h-cr_0.52.784.1097)

Being pampered poolside is always a good idea. Book an afternoon at the spa for some self-care, and make the most of the day lounging around, enjoying everything the resort has to offer.

### 8\. Poolside Mixology Class

![Poolside mixology class bachelorette idea](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/f29e52b6-e10b-40cb-aa87-1eb657cf4cf6~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.784.1045)

_Photo: Brandon Kidd Photography_

Level up an afternoon by the pool with a mixology class. Create a signature drink for the weekend or experiment with mixing up one for the actual wedding.

### 9\. Champagne Shower

![Champagne shower beach bachelorette idea](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/e907a167-6f02-4a40-beff-4f0c4a9de933~rs_768.h-cr_0.52.784.1097)

_Photo: Liv Schulthies_

If you're already at the beach to get wet, you might as well shower yourself in champagne first. But truly, everyone should experience the joy of popping bubbly and spraying it about at least once in their life, and there's no better spot than the beach. 

### 10\. Watch the Sunset

![Watch the sunset beach bachelorette idea](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/7d1f5dea-02a5-45ee-b4e7-a0816e016890~rs_768.h-cr_0.52.784.1097)

_Photo: Louis Fort_

Don't forget to plan in time to watch the sunset. They often go pretty quickly, so make sure everyone is ready when the moment happens. The colors and coziness are more than worth it.
