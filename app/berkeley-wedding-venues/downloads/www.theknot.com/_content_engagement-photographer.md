## What's an Engagement Photographer? 

An engagement photographer is a photographer hired to shoot a couple's engagement photos. Couples will often hire the same photographer for their engagement photos and wedding photos, but this isn't always the case and doesn't have to be—especially if your desired vibe for your engagement shoot is vastly different from that of your wedding. 

According to Los Angeles-based wedding photographer [Kate Jackson](https://www.thekateson.com/), an engagement photographer will help couples scout out locations meaningful to their relationship to take these special snaps, fill them in on helpful [engagement photo tips](https://www.theknot.com/content/engagement-photo-basics) as well as help the pair pose and interact with the camera properly. 

"This shoot is also a great opportunity to show off their personality and things that are a part of their love story," says Jackson.

## How to Choose an Engagement Photographer

It's important to be clear on what to look for when hiring a shutterbug to capture your engagement shots. That's how you find the best engagement photographers, and that's why we're equipping you with the step-by-step list below to guide you through the process. 

![engagement photographer tips](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/d5d973bd-9af2-437e-b161-361b7aa3fd2d~rs_768.h)

### 1\. Nail Down Your Aesthetic Style

Are you light and bright? Or moody and sultry? Or something in between? Understanding at least a little bit about the vibe you'd like to evoke in your engagement shots is a great starting point. This will totally influence which photographer you book (since you want to ensure your desired style is their specialty) and also other aspects of your shoot, like location and time of day. General terms are fine to search for, but it also pays to brush up on some specialty [wedding photography styles](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-photography-styles) to use as search terms. For example, many pros might market themselves as "editorial wedding photographers" (meaning they have a more grand, posed style where the couple appears as if they're being photographed for a magazine) or "documentary wedding photographers" (meaning they capture moments authentically how they unfold and lean into [wedding nostalgia](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-nostalgia)). It also helps to get familiar with [photography trends](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-photography-trends) to get ideas for cool and out-of-the-box shots. You can scout around social media for inspiration and also our Real Weddings gallery to get a feel for the vibe you like. And when you're into an image, click the heart to add it to [Your Favorites](https://www.theknot.com/your-favorites/inspiration).

**Questions to ask an engagement photographer:**

  * How would you describe your photography style? 
  * What inspires your photography? 
  * Can you define your photography aesthetic in three words?



### 2\. Determine Your Timeline

When to hire an engagement photographer depends on a few factors. Some to think about: what season you'd like it to be (if you're taking outdoor shots), if an engagement photo is a priority when it comes to [what to include on your save-the-date](https://www.theknot.com/content/save-the-dates-design-qa) and if your desired engagement photoshoot time frame coincides with prime wedding season. 

"Most save-the-dates are sent out six months in advance, so if you'd like to use the engagement photos, the engagement session needs to be completed well before that," says Jackson. Once you narrow down a window that works for you, you can use it as a decision-making point when choosing an engagement photographer. Additionally, if you would like to use the same shutterbug for your engagement photos and wedding photos, you'll want to get in touch further in advance to ensure your wedding date is available too. 

**Questions to ask an engagement photographer:**

  * Are you available on my wedding date as well as within my earmarked engagement shoot time frame?
  * Do you have the flexibility for backup dates in my desired time frame?
  * How long is your typical photo turnaround?



### 3\. Figure Out Your Budget

How much do engagement pictures cost? As with most wedding vendors, it varies depending on the photographer's demand, experience and package inclusions. Typically, Jackson says an engagement photographer may charge anywhere from $300 to $3,000 or more for an engagement shoot. Determine an appropriate budget for your engagement photographer beforehand before you start your search using the average price of engagement photos to stay on track. Get clarity on the exact inclusions of a photographer's engagement package (in some cases, engagement shots might be bundled into your wedding photography package) in terms of session length, travel fees, deliverables, etc. and what might incur an extra cost.

When it comes to who pays for engagement photos, that responsibility traditionally falls to whoever pays for the wedding photos, according to Jackson. Though nowadays, the pro notes that, even if the couple's parents contribute to the cost of the wedding photographer, many couples will pay for an engagement session themselves. 

Also not to be missed when digging into how much an engagement photographer costs: tipping. Do you tip an engagement photographer? It's up to you! Jackson notes that tipping an engagement photographer is uncommon. However, after the wedding, most couples will [tip their photographer](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-vendor-tipping-cheat-sheet). "Tips are never expected but always welcome," she says. And the "tip" doesn't have to be monetary. A small gift is also greatly appreciated. For example, "I have had quite a few couples bring me cute little gifts at their engagement session, like a box of macarons, a box of cookies and once a beautiful bracelet." Jackson recalls.

**Questions to ask an engagement photographer:**

  * Can you explain your pricing and packages for engagement photos and what they all include?
  * Are there any additional fees beyond the cost for the session?
  * Are engagement photos included in any of your wedding photography packages?



### 4\. Assemble Your Short List 

Once you've figured out your look, time frame and budget, it's time to start researching. Use [The Knot Vendor Marketplace](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace) as a jumping off point to find pro photographers in your area. Here, you can filter by photo style and more, plus read reviews from couples as well as see available dates and pricing up front. It's more curated than simply dropping "find engagement photographers near me" into Google or ChatGPT. 

### 5\. Do a Deep Dive

Once you've researched and narrowed it down to a few engagement photographers, it's time to dive a little deeper to help you and your fiance decide. Review each prospective photographer's portfolio to get a sense of their style and their experience, flagging any shots you like or would like to recreate as you go. Jackson also recommends looking for reviews from past clients on sites like The Knot to ensure other couples had a great experience working with them.

Next, reach out to the photographer to get to know them and see if you like their energy. This is your time to run though your list of [questions to ask a potential photographer](https://www.theknot.com/content/questions-to-ask-wedding-photographer). Jackson's biggest piece of advice is to choose an engagement photographer that makes you and your partner feel comfortable. If you feel like you're just hanging out with a long-time friend, even better.

"You should feel comfortable being open with your photographer, so you feel confident communicating with them," she says. "Open communication is so important during the shoot."

## How to Coordinate With Your Engagement Photographer After Booking

Once you've found your engagement photographer and booked them for a session, the next step is to coordinate the details of your shoot. "Typically, the photographer will reach out to set a day and time," Jackson says. "I would try to start the conversation with the photographer as early as possible since sometimes there is an optimal time of year to shoot certain locations."

As you're coordinating the logistics (date, time, place, etc.), Jackson also advises planning two outfits for your engagement session, so you get some variety in your engagement photographs. Wear whatever makes you feel cute, of course. But as a rule of thumb, she recommends wearing fitted clothing that's not too baggy or too tight.

Lastly, Jackson emphasizes the importance of communicating with your engagement photographer before the session. Share with them your favorite attributes and ones you aren't in love with, she says. For instance, if you have a "good side" that you prefer to be photographed, let them know those details beforehand so they can keep them in mind during the engagement shoot.
