Speaking as the groom, making sure we documented our special day in a meaningful and fun way was my single biggest priority. While looking for the perfect wedding photographer fit,...

it was vital that whoever we choose was someone who could meet our unique schedule demands, understood our often intense family dynamics while also being able to make things fun, while helping us manage the stress of our big day. Kate met all of those requirements as well as helped make our day even more amazing than we could have hoped for. When the bride and her entourage were running late…Kate personally took the groomsmen/myself on a fun photo shoot, which both helped me calm my nerves as well as eased the stressful mood before the ceremony. Further, throughout the actual ceremony and reception, literally anytime I was hoping for a photo with my family/friends, Kate was on my side before I could even turn to look for her. I can’t say enough about Kate, her professionalism and her ability to catch the perfect moment. If you are looking for the perfect wedding photographer, look no further. Kate is your answer!

tood why. Her communication was always prompt, friendly, and reassuring — exactly what you want when planning a wedding. We had also booked her for an engagement shoot and were absolutely blown away and obsessed with how beautiful the photos turned out! Even though we felt awkward with the posing, Kate was patient with us and posed us well so that the photos came out looking natural! On the wedding day, she was incredibly flexible and adaptable, especially with our tight schedule. She kept our timeline moving smoothly without ever making us feel rushed. Her efficiency was matched only by her artistry — she truly has an eye for light and aesthetics, and she captured the soft, romantic vibe we were going for perfectly. The final photos are absolutely beautiful, and we love every single one. We’re so grateful we chose her and would recommend her wholeheartedly to anyone looking for a talented, reliable, and genuinely lovely photographer.

he put us at ease and taking photos with bridal parties and family never felt like a chore. Most importantly, the photos she delivered were exactly what I hoped for when choosing her, if not better. She has a unique ability to bring out the honest connections between family, friends, and especially myself and my husband. Her photos are natural, real, and timeless, in a way that will never go out of style, but instead will remain classic, elegant, and romantic. If you’re on the fence, just book her, you’ll thank me!

Kennedy! From our very first video call, we knew she was the perfect fit. She’s incredibly personable and easy to talk to, and she takes the time to really listen, answering all of our questions thoughtfully. Her photography style is light, airy, and timeless. It was exactly what we were hoping for. We also had the pleasure of doing an engagement shoot with Kate, and we had the best time. She made us feel so comfortable in front of the camera, and after seeing our photos, I had zero doubts that she would capture our wedding day beautifully. We have recently received our wedding photos and we are obsessed! We love Kate!

When I first met with Kate, I told her "I wanted a lot of great photos and to make it to my cocktail hour" and she made that happen. She is more then just a photographer who takes...

high quality photos; she's also organized, timely, helpful, and honest. Not only does she help make your vision come to life, she elevates it with her expertise. And although all of that is important, I think the best thing about Kate is her ability to make people feel comfortable in front of the camera. Like most, our engagement photos were the first time my husband took professional photos and he wasn't too thrilled with the idea... The first thing he said when we left the photoshoot was "Wow, Kate did an amazing job making me feel comfortable and I actually enjoyed it."

rofessional, yet fun demeanor that made us very comfortable in front of the camera. The end product was beautiful and she had such a fast turnaround as well. One of the highlights of working with Kate is that she is incredibly accommodating and creative with certain styles, poses, and styles of shots that I liked. We discussed photos that we liked before the shoots, and to my surprise, she printed the reference images and brought them so that she could reference them during both shoots! Kate also has a distinct eye for poses and angles that she finds and encouraged us to get out of our comfort zone, and captured many candids that we loved. We also discussed what we liked most about our engagement shoot and she applied our thoughts to the photos for our wedding day. Absolutely recommend working with Kate!

The month before the wedding—when things get very stressful—Kate took time out of her day to send me the most supportive and thoughtful text that truly made me feel better.

She takes the most beautiful photos and we’re SO happy with our engagement and wedding pictures (she also turned them around so quickly)! We can’t thank her enough for everything!

Choosing Kate as our wedding photographer was one of the best decisions we made in our wedding planning! Our wedding was originally a 2020 wedding that had to be postponed to 2021 ...

and Kate was flexible, kind, gracious, and understanding through the whole process. From our engagement shoot to our wedding day, Kate captured all the pictures we dreamed of! Our family members and friends all commented on how wonderful, professional, and talented Kate is. Once we got our gallery back, we could not stop obsessing over how beautiful the photos turned out. She captured moments of our wedding in gorgeous photos that we will be looking at for the rest of our lives. Kate is exceptional at what she does. I would hire her again in a second and would recommend her to anyone. Thank you, Kate, for making our wedding photography so spectacular. We are so grateful!

time speaking with her, to our engagement shoot, to her flexibility, patience, and understanding during COVID, she was unbelievable. She also shot our legal wedding ceremony during COVID, never complaining or adding stress to our day. She has a way of making taking photos so fun, and she will be biggest hype woman. She knows exactly how to cue people and her end product is always perfection. On the day of our wedding, she arrived right on time and brought a second photographer, Esme. They made our photo sessions so much fun, and we couldn’t be happier with our photos. Kate is truly talented and has turned from a vendor into a life-long friend. I couldn’t recommend Kate enough, and we can’t wait to use her for all of our family photo shoots in the future. Thank you Kate! You’re the absolute best!!

re very particular about photography, and it took weeks poring through dozens of photographers in California looking for somebody who shoots with both film and digital. We loved how airy, modern and timeless Kate’s portfolio looked, and I especially appreciated how all of her subjects look effortless and beautiful. After interviewing quite a few photographers, we decided to go with Kate! And as an added bonus, she had also shot at our venue, Allied Arts Guild, in the past. Even though we had never met Kate in person (we had spoken a few times on the phone), we felt extremely comfortable and relaxed as soon as we met her! She has a calming yet efficient energy about her, and I love how she took control to let everyone know where to stand, how to place their hands, etc. My partner and I are quite awkward when it comes to posing, but Kate jumped in to give us very clear instructions (where to place our fingers, how to tilt our heads) and made us feel beautiful in pictures! I think the posing instructions are key because on your wedding day, you are being inundated with so many things, it felt relaxing to have somebody who was making sure we looked picture perfect in every shot! I love how she also gave us so many compliments during the shooting process which boosted our confidence and made us feel like we were models. We received our wedding photos back about 5 weeks after our wedding and when we opened the gallery, our jaws dropped to the ground!! Every single shot was absolutely stunning! From the detail shots, the groomsmen photos, the couples portraits to the first dance - everything looked cohesive, beautiful, modern and airy. Kate totally understood the vibe we were going for and she made that vision come to life in her photography! We even asked her to do some minor edits on a few photos and she happily listened to our changes and updated them in a timely matter. I will forever cherish these photos for the rest of our lives and I would highly highly recommend Kate to anybody who is looking for a wedding or engagement photographer! We can’t thank you enough Kate for your beautiful work and making our wedding day so amazing!!

Throw in her kindness, sense of humor, and genuinely sweet personality and you'll want to schedule more shoots just to spend more time with her. She doesn't know it yet, but she will continue to capture our life for as long as she will let us.

r for years. Her humor and sarcasm were exactly what I knew my then fiancé would need to feel comfortable in front of the camera. Kate immediately put us at ease upon our first meeting. Her talent is undeniable but more importantly her personality is that of someone you want to spend time with. What started as engagement pictures turned into wedding photos, maternity photos, and newborn photos. Kate is now part of our family. My husband thinks she is one of the funniest people he know, my mom and mother in law fell in love with her direct communication, professionals, and how organized she is. I love Kate because of her ability to capture the most important moments in my life. She brings out an honest and pure smile, not forced. She will be the person we choose to photograph all of our milestones. I can’t recommend her enough!

TLDR; Kate is a consummate professional, who not only takes beautiful photos that capture the essence of the people in them, but makes the process of working with her from initial ...

interest to delivery of photos, a joy. Event: We hired Kate to photograph our San Francisco City Hall Wedding (which included getting ready moments at the hotel, first look between bride and groom, the wedding, wedding party photos). Why did we choose Kate? We first saw Kate’s work featured online. We loved the way the she shot photos that were ethereal, romantic, and dreamy. Her photos highlight the bride and groom and make people look like polished, natural versions of themselves. Pre-Booking Communication + Contracting: -Initial Contact: We reached out to Kate via her "contact me" page on her website. She responded to us via email to set up a phone call to discuss what we were looking for. -Photography Packages: In advance of the conversation, Kate sent a link to an online portal of the various packages she offered so we could put together some initial thoughts around which package might make sense for our event in advance of the phone call. -Guidance around Wedding Planning: In addition to scoping the photography services required for the event, Kate guided us through what to expect when having a SF City Hall wedding and what we should be thinking about as we planned for our wedding day. Kate’s background in shooting dozens of City Hall weddings gave us guidance around what other couples have done when they've gotten married there. Contracting: -Contract Language: Kate's contract was straightforward and didn’t have any "gotchas.” The language used was clear, easy to read and succinctly outlined expectations, communication and pricing. -Contract Signature Process: Kate sent the contract via Google Docs for us to redline and we exchanged a few emails about tightening up some language prior to signature Payment: -Deposit: We paid a deposit online to secure the booking -Remaining Balance: We paid the remainder of the balance online one month before the event -Payment Tool: Paying via Kate's online payment service was a seamless experience - we received a follow up email receipt and confirmation from Kate that there was no remaining balance due. Having this paper trail provided comfort when working with a new-to-us business. Ongoing Communication between Contracting to Event: -Makeup Artist Recommendation: Kate put us in touch with three trusted makeup artist colleagues that could do makeup for the ladies in the wedding party. We were thrilled with the quality of recommendation she provided and we ultimately chose. -Wedding Day Itinerary Review: We shared the wedding day itinerary with Kate and the makeup artist to confirm that our event scheduling was not too rushed for either artist. Part of the discussion included photography during different times of the day, first looks in heavy trafficked areas (especially in a big city like San Francisco) etc. This helped us determine what time to book our wedding ceremony, though Kate assured us that no matter what time of the day or where we chose, she would make sure our pictures came out beautifully.

When I began my search for a wedding photographer, I had absolutely no idea what I was looking for or what made one photographer better than another... and then I found Kate. Her s...

kills are absolutely unparalleled. She is thoughtful, insightful, artistic and patient. Above all else, she is determined. She will not let you down on your wedding day. My day started as a total disaster- sick bridesmaids, crying mothers, people running behind schedule... just a mess, but Kate jumped right into the challenge, time managing, running around the property, photographing what WAS ready, doubling back to get our before pictures, going back to complete the “before” ceremony pictures at the ceremony sight. I mean we nearly ran her ragged and you would have never known it. She was so supportive and so much more than a photographer- she was a friend. She captured every moment, even the ones I thought for sure were missed and stayed late just to give me peace of mind that every picture I wanted was captured. She took over on every aspect the ball was dropped... from delivering my marriage license to my officiant, to doing up my bustle on my dress because no one else was around to help. She is a fantastic person and an amazing photographer. Her ability to use natural light is like nothing I have seen before. You really can’t go back and do it again- put your dress back on, get your family back... so make sure the pictures you get, are the best possible- and the best possible will be done by Kate. Thanks for everything Kate. I really couldn’t have done it without you.

On top of being so talented, Kate is just the nicest person you'll meet, plus she's great at rounding up friends and family to get the perfect shot. We're so happy we found her!

The moment I saw Kate's pictures on her Instagram page and website, I knew I had to book her for our wedding! Lucky for us she was available, and it has been such a pleasure to wor...

k with her. Leading up to our engagement and wedding shoots, she was in constant communication with us, providing suggestions on shoot locations, and making sure we were always happy. She is so down to earth, professional, and has a good sense of humor!I feel that both our engagement and wedding shoots went by very quickly as she made us feel comfortable with her charm and humor, as well as her talented photography skills. Most importantly, the way Kate captures the moment with beautiful natural light is amazing! We are so glad we had Kate as our wedding photographer!

This woman. I don't even have words. Kate was hands down our favorite vendor that we booked for the big day. Actually, she's probably one of my favorite people I've met in the last...

five years. I'll start with the important stuff - our photos turned out insanely beautiful, literally more gorgeous than I could've imagined. I chose her because of how she captures light in photos, everything is warm and dreamy. Our photos look like they came out of a bridal magazine! But just as important to me as her talent, Kate is someone you WANT to have around on your wedding day. She's not in the way, she's not awkward, she's not mean to your guests when you're trying to line everyone up. She's professional, she's funny and she's just seriously cool. I'm a perfectionist and trust me, she makes things look perfect. We had 4-5 conversations throughout our planning period and each one left me feeling so good and relaxed about our choice to bring her on. Even now, we stay in touch and I plan to tap her for her talents again somewhere down the line. If she's available, book her immediately. Seriously, stop thinking about it, just do it. You will not regret it.

We were beyond blessed to find Kate as our wedding photographer. She is down-to-earth, professional, and she has a natural way of making her clients feel comfortable. When we rec...

eived our photos back I was literally in tears! It was evident in our photos that she thinks about every single detail, and she was always aware of which side I liked as my "good side," which I appreciated A LOT as the bride! She used mostly film, and some digital for our wedding, and I feel like it made the lighting look so dreamy and perfect. We also got our photos back in such a timely manner, along with an adorable USB and she was thoughtful enough to send us prints in a box. We could not have asked for a better experience with Kate! She is truly outstanding.

Kate captured every ounce of magic our day held, and made it come alive in her photos. She truly has a gift for seeing beauty in the details, and her style of photography is so th...

oughtful...somehow able to illustrate all the feelings of each distinct moment. Working with Kate was one of the first decisions we made when planning our wedding, and I can honestly say the best. She was incredibly responsive to all of our questions, worked with changing timelines, and seamlessly managed to corral my wedding party and large family when it came time for the post-ceremony shoot (not an easy task). Through this process I no longer consider Kate as simply our wedding photographer, but also a friend. There really is no one better.

My husband and I feel blessed and so lucky to have had kate be our photographer for our wedding. We had an unusual experience when it came to picking our photographer. Kate was ori...

ginally in our top 3 to choose, but she was more than we had budgeted for so we had to continue our search and went with another photographer...4 months before our wedding, our photographer had to back out. I was worried that in 4 months I would not have enough time to find a great photographer. I emailed Kate and she was still available, I told her about our budget, and she totally worked with us. We did an engagement shoot and our pictures were so beautiful! The quality of her pictures are amazing and she knows how to work with lighting which is so important. The photos turned out so natural, with beautiful lighting, and we did not look "posed". My husband and I felt so comfortable around her, she is friendly, quiet and not in the way, and she captures just the most amazing shots. We are so happy that our older photographer backed out because we got more then what we could have asked for with Kate. We are still waiting for our wedding pictures, but we got some sneak peaks and OMG we are obsessed. We can't wait to see the rest. Kate also gets your photos back to you quickly. We had all our engagement pictures within 3 weeks and got our sneak peaks for the wedding in 2 weeks, we should have the rest in about 1 week. Other photographers said it would take 2 months! Overall, i can't say enough how thankful to have Kate as our photographer, we will definitely be using her in the future.

lly comfortable with. She was was definitely there to capture all our special moments. Getting the photos was like reliving the wedding with rose-colored glasses - - the photos were so gorgeous! They told the story of our wedding day in the most beautiful of ways! The photos are something my husband and I will cherish for decades to come. I whole-heartedly recommend Kate as a wedding photographer!

Working with Kate was everything we hoped for in a photographer and more. As soon as we met for our engagement photos, we were put at ease. She made us feel so comfortable and knew...

what poses to put us in. Right up to the wedding I never had to worry - she followed up with us promptly and checked in often. On the wedding day all our guests commented on how impressed they were. She was professional and calm and did a great job directing us so that I didn't have to worry about a thing. Our photos are beautiful and she returned them to us so quickly after the wedding day. We couldn't be happier!

Kate was our photographer for our engagement photos and wedding. The entire experience, from our first meeting, to the engagement session, to the beautiful retouched final images, ...

has been wonderful and flawless. Kate is incredibly easy and fun to work with, putting us at ease with her quick decisions during our shoots, noticing which areas, poses, and lighting would make excellent photographs. She has taken some of the best photographs of us we have ever seen, but my favorite part about her work is that none of our photos feel posed. She has true skill at capturing the spirit, emotion, and honesty of the moment... which is especially evident in our wedding photos. Kate took the stress off of us during the busiest and most exciting time of our lives, and we cannot possibly thank her enough for recording our memories with such beauty and truth.

I feel so lucky to have found Kate for our engagement and wedding photography! The quality of her work is exceptional, and her warm, laid-back demeanor puts you at ease the moment ...

you meet her. She made both my husband and I feel comfortable in front of the camera, and we had so much fun traipsing through the woods for our engagement session. Her photography style is natural, light-filled and authentic, never cheesy or staged as you often see with wedding photography. She is easy to work with, dependable, and took many beautiful, creative photos on our wedding day. It rained off and on the day of our wedding, but we were still able to get many beautiful outdoor shots during the dry periods, and those are my favorite photos from that day! I hope to work with Kate again in the future.
