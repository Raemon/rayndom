Stephanie is a LIFESAVER. I don't think I understood how important having a wedding coordinator is until you just get seamlessly shuffled throughout your day without a hitch. She i...

s kind, very patient and somehow just makes everything work. We interviewed a couple of planners and Stephanie stood out to us because she asked us specific questions to get to know our needs (of which, we didn't even know)! She brought in staff to help us with some of the day of things and really made us able to enjoy the day as much as possible! Aisle planner, the app she uses is really helpful, however at times was 2x the work if you use the knot for RSVPs. Stephanie also knows every vendor and has experience working with them ALL. She also knew our venue which was also a HUGE help with set up and recommendations. I don't know how she does what she does, but I guess that's why she is special. Hire off the beaten path and you won't regret!

Stephanie is an amazing wedding planner!! She helped guide us from start to finish on all wedding things big and small, most of which we had no idea we needed to do in the first pl...

ace. Her extensive planning experience is SO apparent when speaking to her (why we chose her), and she has this calm, cool and collected energy that is lifesaving when you’re in the thick of making a million small planning decisions. We always felt sure that nothing was going to go wrong (and nothing did!). She told us what we needed to do when, and helped us narrow down decisions with simple options and often reminded us of what we originally said we wanted, which is easy to lose sight of during the process. She connected us to the venue of our DREAMS, and the whole wedding weekend went off without a single hitch. Honestly, we partly didn’t even realize how PERFECTLY Stephanie planned and executed our wedding until we attended a wedding as guests a few weeks later. All the little details that Stephanie did without even telling us suddenly became apparent - like having already opened bottles of wine on the dinner tables, so none of our guests had to wait, having ample lighting for evening time, having thought through the flow of the event, just everything. We are so grateful for her kindness and competency in the entire lead up to and during our wedding. Please choose Off the Beaten Path Weddings (her company) as she and the whole team are so lovely and amazing! We really are so, so happy we worked with them and can’t recommend them strongly enough.

g to Stephanie the first time we knew she was a perfect fit. Price is very reasonable especially in the Napa county area, she is very sweet, extremely helpful (especially since we are from Hawaii), organized--of course super important for a wedding planner, and doesn't mind I emailed and texted her frequently. Stephanie was everything we needed her to be. She let me have my creative ideas yet was there to rely on for input and amazing execution. She helped setup introductions to any vendors, reviewed every contract, and looked into any questions we had. She let us feel at ease but did not take control of every aspect that let us design our dream wedding. Stephanie sent a website that became my most visited website over that span of one and a half years, Aisle Planner. I absolutely love organization and that website was just that, a website to organize tasks, retain info and ideas, progress percentage, and connect to OTBP. On to the wedding day, Stephanie made sure everything went so smoothly and went off without a hitch! Everything was done exactly how I wanted and even better. She directed our guests to where they needed to go and pay attention to. She truly is the best and was so essential to why our wedding came out like a dream. Glad we asked to take a photo with her in our Photo Booth before she left for the night. She will forever be apart of our fridge. Shout out to Gloria, OTBP calligrapher, who wrote on the growlers that we sent her for table seating which came out beautifully. Thank you Stephanie and the team at Off The Beaten Path!! -Karina and Chris

Stephanie and her team from Off The Beaten Path were an asset in planning our wedding. I interviewed a few different planners, and I especially liked Stephanie for her ability to b...

e professional while also being easy to talk to and laid back. It was especially important for us to hire a planner because we were having our wedding at a family member's private residence - so there would be a lot of logistics involved that I would not know how to approach. Stephanie and her team were SO incredibly helpful in coming up with a layout for the day, and problem-solving logistics like lighting and ceremony and table placements. On top of the logistics, Stephanie and her team helped us bring our decor vision to life - helping to organize inspiration photos we liked and giving input on design choices. Maybe the best part of hiring Stephanie and her team, was having her and her staff there for day of coordination. Everything went smoothly, and they rolled with the unexpected changes. We also enjoyed the catering. The guests were very impressed with the food and the service. Thank you to Stephanie and her team, for helping us through the process of planning our dream day!

Stephanie and her OTBP team planned our wonderful wedding in Sept. '18. It was an outdoor wedding with a lot of different personalized components, including last minute changes due...

to weather patterns. Stephanie curated a day for us that captured everything we wanted. She had great recommendations for us based on her years of experience in the field and we never felt pressured to do or go with anything other than exactly what fit our vision for the day. To this day, our friends regularly volunteer to us that ours was the most fun and/or favorite wedding they have attended, and we know we owe OTBP for pulling it off! Throughout the planning process, Stephanie kept us at ease, staying levelheaded and keeping a great sense of humor. On the day of the wedding, OTBP crew were working so hard behind the scenes, and we did not have to stress over things that we found out about later from her (that were no fault of their team). Our family and friends all found them to be a delight to work with and kept telling us how great Stephanie was. In the end, we could not have been happier with OTBP and are so grateful that they were recommended to us! We would recommend them to anyone, especially those looking to create a unique and personalized experience for their guests.

My oldest daughter was married 4 years ago in Washington DC. She had an absolutely terrific wedding planner. When my youngest daughter became engaged our standards were high and ...

we didn't think it was possible for anyone to fill those shoes. OTBP was recommended to us and we liked their philosophy of good food, good company in the beautiful outdoors. However we were hesitant as we felt like we were putting all our eggs in one basket. In hindsight, we could not be happier. Stephanie is worth gold!!! She is professional, extremely organized, pays attention to the smallest of details, truly wishes for the bride and groom to have their special day and is a wonderful person. She kept us on a timeline that made us feel in control even though we only had 4 months to plan and kept us on budget. Costs were always transparent. There was no pressure whatsoever to use their recommended vendors but having done so on most things helped streamlined the process. Stephanie was in close contact with all vendors regardless where they came from. Due to terrific planning and a terrific leader the day of the wedding was seamless. The venue looked gorgeous. The guests loved the food and it was all done quietly and professionally. The wedding was on the same day as the royal couple. As one guest put it, "Sorry Meghan and Harry but this wedding was one for the ages." We credit Stephanie and her team. I would highly recommend OTBP. You will have a beautiful wedding and work with a special person with special talents.

Stephanie and and her team at Off the Beaten Path are hands down the way to go for your wedding in wine country..don't think I could write a more apt thank you note than the one fr...

om the Mother of the Bride below: "So here I sit, trying to think of a word bigger than thanks.... because thanks doesn't do justice to the gratitude we feel for the amazing experience of Saturday evening. From the moment the ceremony began, Kelsey and Brian seemed to float through the evening in utter bliss -- everything that they had envisioned for their wedding (and more) unfolded before them and they relished every second of it! Russ and I, too, were completely transported into the magic -- we ate, drank and danced the night away without a worry in the world. And our guests... well, they couldn't stop gushing... everyone was intoxicated as much by the place, the food, and the experience as they were by the wine! You two, together with your team, literally made dreams come true. Small as the words may seem in light of the big sentiment I want to express... THANK YOU.... Thank you for allowing us the opportunity to tap into your extraordinary talents for design, organization and execution. From the selection of the venue back in December to the loading of the last shuttle on Saturday night, the service you provided and confidence you inspired in all of us made every stage of the wedding planning process a pleasure. Thanks to you, Stephanie, for being our unflappable "boots on the ground" at site visits and in countless phone calls, texts and emails. And for your amazing calm as the loose ends inevitably came together just as the shuttles rolled up with the first guests! You're the absolute best at what you do and it was a pleasure getting to know you. I'll miss our frequent contact! Finally, thank you to your extraordinary team of chefs and servers and bartenders, who prepared delicious food, kept the wine flowing, and generally made us all feel like guests of the king!"

eeping a lot of the stress and burden off of us. She listened to our vision and executed it perfectly as well as incorporating details all over the place that really brought everything together and made the whole day magical. They say that weddings are supposed to be stressful and that something inevitably goes wrong - but with the OTBP team behind you there is nothing to worry about!

s before our wedding date. That just tells you how excited we were to work with her. From the get-go, she was incredibly responsive, organized, creative, and overly accommodating. I can't say enough about her fabulous ideas, talent, and hard work!!! Our wedding day was not the easiest due to the wild winds and Stephanie and Gloria remained cool as cucumbers, handling everything with such charm and grace. Even when I was melting down, they kept this crazy bride in check! Lol Steph and Gloria truly created the most magical wedding experience! Not only were they the most amazing planners and creators, but Trent and I have now gained friends for life. Again I cannot say enough wonderful things about OTBP. A true blessing and total gems to work with!!

Off the Beaten Path was recommended to us by a co-worker who had used them for her destination wedding in Napa. My husband and I immediately were drawn to the unique weddings with ...

a focus on the culinary and styling a unique event. Mary Ellen and Stephanie were so much fun to work with. They made our vision come alive! From the flowers to the food to the reception design, every aspect was stunning. Every element of the big day was perfectly planned. We still have guests comment us on the wedding, especially the food. The Off the Beaten Path team truly cannot be beat!
