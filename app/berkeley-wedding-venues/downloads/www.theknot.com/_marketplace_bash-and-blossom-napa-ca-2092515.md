Amiee and her team are the best! We would rate them 10 stars if we could! They were our caterer for our Sonoma vineyard wedding and we are completely blown away by our experience. ...

I did a lot of research in caterers and not only was Amiee’s prices extremely reasonable, the quality of food was exceptional. Based on previous experiences at other weddings, my husband and I have already adjusted our expectations on the quality bar knowing the logistic challenges of catering a large group but WOW, did they blow our expectations through the roof! From our large meat and cheese grazing table to the most succulent and delicious main courses during our reception, all our guests (even our parents who are very picky) were all raving about the food. On top of everything, Amiee was so sweet and easy to work with throughout the whole process which really is any wedding couple’s dream. Thank you Amiee and team for all your hard work and care! We would highly recommend them to everyone!!

Amiee and her team are great! Amiee was our caterer at our wedding at Trentadue Winery in Aug 2018. I planned my wedding from out of town, and Amiee made the whole process easy - s...

he was very personable and quick to respond with all my email inquiries. I had talked to other caterers from the preferred vendor list our venue gave us, but I felt that I connected the most with Amiee - she was very warm even with our first phone call. Right away, she was able to get what my husband and I like when it comes to food and she was able to create an amazing menu for us, based on what our food preferences are - we decided on Californian/Asian-inspired dishes. When we finally did our tasting with her, me and my husband were blown away by how good the food was! Needless to say we were confident that we made the right choice. On our wedding day, all of our guests were raving about the food! Which is a huge deal because our families can be very critical when it comes to food. From the appetizers, to the main entrees, and the dessert, everything was perfect (did I mention she also included a token cake for cutting, for free?!). Amiee's staff was very friendly too - they made sure all of the guests were attended to. Thanks so much, Amiee! I absolutely recommend her to everyone!

Amiee and her team were a DREAM to work with! They provided catering for our Rehearsal Dinner, breakfast for the bridal party on the day of, and the Wedding. Leading up to the wedd...

ing, food was important to my husband and I, and Amiee was great about listening to what it was we wanted and being flexible and creative with our menus. She was very responsive and was also very respectful of our budget and staying within our means. It was the first time Amiee and her team had catered at our Rehearsal Dinner and Wedding venue, but you would never have known it. The staff were extremely attentive and professional, and did a great job at both events. Not to mention, the food at both events was AMAZING and the presentation was spectacular! Several of our guests raved about the food afterwards, sharing that it was the best they had ever had at a wedding. One final touch that Amiee did, that is so reflective of who she is as a person, was she sent my husband and I home with a thoughtful "to go" bag on the night of our wedding which included: boxed up meals for the two of us, a bottle of champagne, a tea towel, and several goodies from her farm. I would HIGHLY recommend using Amiee and her team. We are from out of town, but hope to use her again at some point in the future!! A big THANK YOU to Amiee and her team at Amiee D'Maris Events for helping to make our wedding day the best for us and our guests.

From the very first email, working with Amiee D'Maris and her phenomenal team was a wonderful experience. Food is very important to me personally, and I had high standards for the ...

food at our wedding. Amiee is a brilliant and conscience chef. Her food is beautiful, locally sourced, sustainable, and most importantly DELICIOUS! Our guests raved about the service and presentation and just how delightful the meal was. Oh, and our late night snacks were a huge hit. Amiee was instrumental in planning the meal and bar program and thoughtfully crafted the flow of the evening. Overall, it was just perfect. My highest recommendations!

I searched high and low for Amiee. We are a Texas couple, and I have swooned over getting married in a specific church in Cali for over a dozen years ( Old Saint Hilary - Tiburon)....

When I started searching for caterers I started to panic because everything was so costly compared to Texas. My personal taste leans HARD on the finer side - so skimping on my special day was OUT of the question. Amiee D'Maris Events worked with me throughout the 9 month process of coordinating my entire day - so she was a "one stop shop", Amiee does SO much more than just amazing food. She is creative and quickly picks up on your style from the get go. She takes every single detail to heart, this business really means a lot to her - and it showed in every detail. She has the best connections for everything you need to fill your wedding details, from DJ, to furniture, to silverware and linens. I watched her effortlessly orchestrate her staff into a beautiful symphony that your heart will sing forever in memory of your special day. I am NOT exaggerating by any means when I tell you that when I walked into my reception....my heart was in heaven! Everything was beautiful... even more so than I had imagined! The food was 5 star ALL the way, each and every one of my guests were treated like royalty (and my Husband and I were King & Queen for the night), they constantly observed everyone in the room and if anyone looked as if they needed someone...POOF!..a host was right there serving them. People still talk about my wedding, which was in May of 2015, and say it was a fairy tale wedding. Throughout the whole process, I have definitely gained a friend. Amiee will always be a part of the most special day of my life, and she was a huge part of it. Look no further...if you can dream it, she can do it - no matter your budget, no matter your style, she is flexible and easy and fun to work with. She has the vision...I promise. Call me personally if you need to - I'd be happy to talk about it! :) - Sarah

We had a relatively small wedding with a budget of $5000 for 80-100 ppl. Devoted was the only caterer in the area that didn't laugh in our faces at our budget. They actually made...

a concerted effort to make a menu within our budget. They were also very understanding when my husband complained that their original menu for us seem to upscale for our tastes. They quickly came up with a more laid-back menu for us. We settled on fried chicken and biscuits. Not your typical wedding food, but our guests raved about it at the reception. As, my mom put it, it was "gourmet fried chicken". I've been assured by many that they will not forget about it. As far as working with Devoted, they have one event planner, Tiffany. She was excellent to work with and was helpful with my indecisiveness when my husband chose to stay away from the wedding planning chaos. Day-of I didn't have to worry about anything. Tiffany took care of getting all of the tables set and ready while the food was prepared. Overall, awesome experience!
