This is a great venue! They were so easy to work with. They really know how to put on an event! The vendor they use for the drink service was so great! We got customized signature ...

drinks and everything was reasonably priced. The stage was perfect for our Sangeet performances. Having the green room was great for the performers who needed to change into their costumes too.

The moment I stepped into the galleria, I knew this was where we wanted to hold our reception. It’s just a beautiful venue where you get both a glam and modern look all in one. No...

t much decorating is needed as the lighting and the venue itself pretty much speaks for itself. There is plenty of parking across the street and along the streets. Our wedding was on a Sunday, so parking was also free, which was a definite plus. Julia was awesome! She was so easy to communicate and work with. I couldn’t have loved SFDC more! It was everything I ever hoped for our wedding!

We recently held our 200-person wedding reception at the Design Center and it was jaw-droppingly beautiful. The venue has lighting services that really add to the ambiance. There i...

s a stage for cake/dj/sweetheart table/head table, a large dancing space, and plenty of room (and levels!) for guest tables. The area at night was fine and luckily the parking lot was available and free. Chuck (lighting services) was so nice and helpful, as was Julia, the event manager.

GORGEOUS venue, tons of free parking on Sunday, fits a huge number of people. Wonderful people to work with! The only downside is that they tell you that your caterer can only pr...

ovide drinks, and that all other drinks (even soft drinks!) must come from Perry's Bar, the official bar in the SF Design Center Galleria. Eventually we pulled it out of them that we could bring our own drinks, but all ALCOHOLIC drinks had to come from Perry's Bar. So clarify that at the beginning- everything else was WONDERFUL!!!
