Description

A beaded short wedding dress that glows with the warmth of her name, Sunshine radiates sparkle in every detail. Her strapless neckline is softened with detachable off-the-shoulder sleeves, giving you two glamorous looks in one. A sheath silhouette with a draped satin skirt sculpts the figure, while her crystal-beaded bodice shimmers like rays of light. Perfect for the bride who wants to shine from ceremony to dance floor, she’s equal parts classic romance and modern sparkle.
