We used The Juniper Hotel as our hotel for some of our guests and our post wedding brunch. Because of Covid, we had to change all of our original plans and the Juniper stayed flexi...

ble the entire time. They made sure they were able to work around what we wanted as well as follow CDC and state guidelines. Everyone was very happy with their rooms knowing the care that the Hilton took in cleaning everything. We were very happy with the brunch as well. Sometimes hotel food can be hit or miss, but it was amazing! Our guests were very happy with the food and our "bottomless" mimosas and bloody marys. The best part was working with the Juniper team. They were responsive and very helpful. I believe the sweetest touch was us mentioning we didn't need to rent vases for center pieces because we weren't having any flowers at our ceremony, but when we showed up the next morning, there were beautiful and simple centerpieces set up.

Everyone really liked this venue! It was great to have the ceremony, cocktail hour and reception at the same venue but in different areas of the hotel. There's a great little firep...

lace area with couches, a lovely hall with covered outdoor access, an outdoor fountain for great photo ops and great reception hall. The hall is already decorated so you dont have to do much. What a plus! There's also a great restaurant downstairs where the food comes from and is also available to have the after party! The staff was helpful and courteous! Overall great place to have a wedding! Got a lot of compliments from family and friends that attended the wedding.

This hotel was one of the the closest full-service hotels to our venue. They allowed us to use their hotel shuttle to transport guests, had amazingly helpful staff anytime assistan...

ce was needed, and have a decent group rate, especially for the silicon valley. I recommend this venue for out of town guests and wedding party accommodations. The rooms are stylish and modern, with comfortable beds. Suites are available for the bridal party/families traveling together. They also allow pets, for those who want to bring Fido with them. The only minus is that their pool is off-site, but for a wedding, most people are not needing that amenity. There is an on-site bar that entertained us after the wedding was over - very convenient! There are a plethora of tasty restaurants of all kinds nearby for your guests that want to try something new.

5 more stars please! This is an update as I had my wedding at the Cypress Hotel last weekend... Lesley was my coordinator from the hotel and I have to say that throughout the who...

le planning process she was extremely responsive, patient and totally positive. She made me feel at ease. The hotel executed every last detail I asked for perfectly. The place looked great, the food tasted fantastic, and all the tables were setup exactly how I asked. The cocktail hour went fabulously with everyone complimenting the food. Our room blocks went well and the bridal suite we got was fantastic--Elizabeth took care of our rooms as well as booked our ride to the airport the next day for us. She was quick to respond and always very pleasant. The AV rep, Oscar, made our room pop with the uplights exactly how we asked them to be. Our ceremony was at another ballroom that was also setup perfectly. I cannot praise them enough b/c I had braced myself for some sort of huge disaster a the wedding as there usually is one, and I'm happy to say it never happened for us. Thank you Cypress! I highly recommend you!

ad such a wonderful wedding ceremony (outside in courtyard), reception (in large ballroom), and wedding night. The catering sales manager, Lesley is so genuinely nice and made everything happen without any bumps that I could notice as a bride. The only negative thing was that when we went to get our leftover centerpieces the next morning, they were all stacked on too small of a table causing some of them to be damaged. I highly recommend this venue to anyone who wants a wedding at a boutique hotel.
