AWARD WINNER (1X)

Thanks to recommendations from couples on The Knot

Located in Livermore, CA, Adam J. Clark Photography captures weddings, special events, and portraits throughout the greater Bay Area. Owner Adam loves photographing weddings and is inspired by the energy and excitement at these celebrations of love. He values creating beautiful and candid imagery that memorializes the emotion and love of his subjects on their special day. Adam has been interested in photography since a young age and used to take his father’s 35mm camera with him everywhere he went. Convinced that this passion was a hobby and not a career, he studied engineering in college. Still drawn to the medium, he later attended the Art Institute of Seattle, where he earned a degree in Commercial Photography. Over a career spanning over 30 years, he perfected his craft and eventually opened his own studio with the goal of documenting his clients’ life milestones. For your wedding needs, Adam will work with you to create a relaxing, fun, and creative photography experience. Along with your ceremony and reception, he is also available to shoot your engagement session. He provides high-resolution photos in digital files and a second shooter upon request. While he is based in the East Bay, he can also document destination weddings on the Big Island in Hawaii and other locations.

Adam J Clark

Owner

I have long had a passion for art, specifically photography. When I was young I was fascinated by my Grandfather's Nikomat camera. In my down time I love spending time with my dog, visiting with family and friends around the country, SCUBA diving, running, skiing, hiking and staying fit. I also very much love to visit Hawaii, and live the Aloha spirit. I love what I do and I am dedicated to making your portraits a unique and special work of art, worthy of viewing by future generations. Full Bio http://www.adamjclarkphotography.com/about.php

He did an amazing job capturing our special days without making me feel like I needed to pose for a photo. 100% would recommend booking Adam!

He’s incredibly professional and did everything he could to make sure the day ran smoothly. All the photos he took were beautiful. It’s hard to choose which ones to frame.

(which were ready right away). But the best part was Adam's personality and the way he connected with my friends and family. We quickly felt like he was part of the family. He joked with us and lightened up any moment when we were nervous while also being very professional. I loved that he wears a bowtie to match the wedding party. Adam was more than a photographer. He had tools and supplies for anything we needed. He even helped my sister bustle my dress. I could tell we were in good hands from the moment I met him, and it brought me so much peace. I am beyond happy that we chose Adam to capture our special day, and I highly recommend him!

cided to meet him in person (however, he was willing to do zoom or over the phone too). To our meeting, he was early and got to the meet up destination before we did. He showed us pictures of his other work and we loved the work he did with the lighting. As the big day came closer, we had more meetings (this time on zoom) and he took the schedule we had for the day and created a photo schedule. The schedule included where we would be and who we would want pictures with at what time. He also suggested things that my husband and I hadn't even thought of! When the big day came, Adam was amazing! Adam was able to help keep our day on track, along with our other vendors. Even though we had some rebel rousers on our side, he was able to take charge and get photos with a smile. We also had some older people at our wedding who had some physical disabilities; and he was able to accommodate them too so that we could get lovely pictures with them.We got all the pictures that he took of our big day and we couldn't be more happy with his services. He was great with posing us and using the natural lighting to get some really awesome shots. Plus he is very sweet and funny; and that helped us keep our smiles going for the pictures all through out the day. We highly highly recommend!

There is simply no better photographer than Adam J Clark! Adam shot out wedding this year and it was so special to have him there. We have been dating for over 13 years and Adam ha...

s been there to see the entirety of our relationship. From high school senior photos and football pictures, parents weddings, to now our wedding day he has been there capturing our special moments. It meant the world to us to have someone who knew us so well, we were so comfortable with and feels like family. Words can’t express how phenomenal of a job Adam did for our wedding and how he went above an beyond. I got SO MANY compliments on how helpful, kind and talented he was!! Everyone was raving about him and how hard he worked. He’s the most compassionate, patient and talented photographer you will ever meet. As many brides are, I was anxious and definitely forgot many things. But Adam came to the rescue time after time with his “Mary Poppins” utility belt of live savers. He kept us on pace, made sure everything was taken care of and the photos came out STUNNING. We got them back so quickly too and it was so exciting to see! Adam works incredibly hard and somehow manages to be five men in one: a photographer, bridesmaids/groomsman handler, comedian, lifesaver and therapist! If you want someone who will make you feel supported, loved and cared for, Adam is certainly the best choice. Thank you so much for capturing our special life moments Adam, we love and appreciate you!

My husband and I cannot rave about Adam enough. He did an AMAZING job at our wedding last month at Casa Real in Pleasanton, CA. Our photos were absolutely stunning! We hired Adam ...

for 6 hours on our wedding day. We had ~90 guests. We didn’t want all of the pre-wedding photos that people sometimes take, nor did we do a “first look”. We really did not want to get bogged down with so much posing for photos that we wouldn’t have time to enjoy our day. Adam knew this was important to us and he really balanced well getting in all of our photos but making it fun in the process! Adam has a great sense of humor and he always got the biggest smiles out of us. He gave us and our family some breaks during cocktail hour too which was much appreciated. It gave us time to enjoy some of the cocktail hour food and drinks. We also were able to have a quiet moment to ourselves before the reception which was wonderful. We got amazing shots in the vineyards at sunset as well as many organic photos with friends and family that turned out to be some of our favorite. Adam’s pricing was very reasonable. He respected that we were on a tight budget and worked with us. We didn’t have to compromise on photos on our special day and we got exactly what we wanted. Our guests also raved about Adam to us after the wedding. He was so much fun and engaged with our guests to get great photos for us to remember this day forever. Lastly, Adam was highly professional and went above and beyond. For example, he was available at the time of our rehearsal the day before and he came and met us and the day-of coordinator and we went through the rehearsal. He and the coordinator worked together to keep everything on time. He also arrived early and came prepared on our wedding day. Adam had everything from hair pins to stain remover! He had many helpful tips for my dress (which the bridal store didn’t tell me) and he bustled it before the reception in under a minute. He was so helpful! We HIGHLY RECOMMEND Adam for your wedding photos. You will not be disappointed!

os, and they came out breathless. When it came to our wedding day Adam was just perfect. Hands down was my favorite person to work with. He went above and beyond. Come wedding day he was my right hand man. He had pins for my hair, deodorant, kept me away from being seen by guests upon arrival, and he even help my dress over the fan when it was too hot.(if you know, you know) 10/10 absolutely the best and we will be calling him again at our next millstone in life. He wasn't just photographer!!! You are amazing Adam!

Adam was awesome to work with for our June 2024 wedding day!! He was very communicative ahead of time and helped us formulate the most efficient photography timeline. When the day ...

came, he was punctual and prepared when he arrived. He made everyone feel comfortable and was great at instructing/positioning people for pictures. He scouted the area before taking the wedding party through and knew all the best spots to get the best shots. The pictures turned out fantastic. He was great to work with, easy going, and (most importantly) took great pictures.

I am so thankful to Adam because he was super caring- always bringing me water, carrying things for me, and making sure I was okay, while he himself, was running around in the heat with all the camera equipment! The pictures, of course, turned out so so beautiful. We, along with all of our bridesmaids and groomsmen, had such a lovely experience working with Adam. I 1000% recommend him if you are looking for a sincere, and great photographer to capture your special day!

Adam did such an amazing job incorporating the beautiful surroundings into the photos, we had no idea during the shoot but when we saw the photos afterwards and how he captured the light and different backgrounds to make the photos interesting and dynamic instead of basic posed shots, we were incredibly impressed, he has an amazing eye for getting a great shot. We could not recommend him enough and are so glad we have such amazing photos (and so many) to look back on for years to come! We are so glad he is photographing our wedding too!

st did an engagement shoot and it was our first ever photoshoot as a couple. We were feeling a little nervous about how posing would feel. Adam made us feel so comfortable and it felt so easy to take pictures. We went to a beach in Half Moon Bay, the location was so beautiful. We are so in love with our pictures and has been so hard to choose which ones we want to print, because we just love all of them. We are very excited for wedding photos next year. \- updated after our wedding! Adam was amazing! He did such a great job, we are so in love with our wedding pictures. He helped us out so much in the day of and is really hands on in helping direct and love along everything we wanted to do the day off. He made taking pictures feel so easy and effortlessly. We are not used to taking pictures as a couple but we felt so comfortable when doing so. We would highly recommend him for photos. He is super responsive and super quick to get the photos back.

Adam is, without a doubt, one of the most extraordinary photographers I’ve ever encountered. Every photo he takes is a masterpiece, making it impossible for us to choose just a few...

favorites to enlarge—each one is a work of art. His keen eye for detail—capturing the perfect angles, lighting, and poses—is unmatched. At our wedding, Adam was phenomenal. He guided our guests with such ease and expertise that every photo perfectly captured the essence of the moment. Everyone looked their best and adored their pictures. His turnaround time is impressively quick; we received our stunning wedding photos within just a couple of days. Adam truly understands the art and craft of photography. His creative vision and ability to identify the most flattering poses set him apart. If you want photos that are out of this world, look no further than Adam. He is the absolute best. We feel incredibly fortunate to have chosen Adam for our special day. He is not only exceptionally talented but also a joy to work with. His sense of humor ensures everyone has a great time, and smiles are guaranteed. Adam, we are profoundly grateful for your gift in capturing our happiest moments so beautifully. Reliving our wedding day through your photos is an absolute joy. "Thank you" hardly conveys the depth of our gratitude.

Our wedding photos turned out beautiful and Adam captured all of the important moments as well as the little details of the day. Adam was easy to communicate with and quick to respond. He was able to send our photos for both shoots to us in record time, a matter of days, and will happily take editing requests. We’d highly recommend him!

He has a portable changing station for outfit changes, a blanket for seated photos, hand warmers for cold weather, and has worked in the bay for long enough he can provide great location recommendations.
