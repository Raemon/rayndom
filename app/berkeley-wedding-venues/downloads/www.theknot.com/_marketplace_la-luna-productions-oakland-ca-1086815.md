We are SO HAPPY we found Nico to be our wedding videographer. He was so easy to work with and took the time to get to know us before our big day. He was so open to our ideas, visio...

On the day of, he helped make things go smoothly with the photographer (a separate vendor) and we were able to just relax without worrying about logistics.

We highly recommend Nico to every bride/groom, you won’t be disappointed!

grapher. If you're questioning it, don't question it anymore. Hire a videographer and hire Nico! He was incredibly professional from the first email, to the day of the wedding, and then to producing the final video (WHICH WAS ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL and made my cry, in the good way). He's truly talented and so creative with his shots--catching some breathtaking moments that I will cherish forever. He worked seamlessly with our photographer and other vendors to allow for a flawless day. His editing style truly captures the wedding day. I have watched the video over and over again. I am so thankful to Nico and his creativity and vision for our wedding day!

Nico was one of our favorite vendors to work with for our wedding! He was professional but relaxed and did a fantastic job capturing all of the special moments on our wedding day....

I was very impressed with how nicely he paired the music with the footage and how the videos he produced had this very romantic and magical feel to them. Additionally, his pricing points are great. My husband and I did a lot of research into videographers for our wedding and decided to move forward with La Luna due to the production quality of the videos, value for your money, and the opportunity to support a small business. We would absolutely hire Nico again in a heartbeat and are so happy with our decision. We were thrilled with how both our teaser and full video turned out and I still get butterflies watching these videos!

f our favorite moments of the day, and we are so grateful for all of the raw video he took of the ceremony, speeches, and dances. Nico remained unobtrusive during the whole day, which allowed us to be fully present in the moment, and all of his footage of it was phenomenal. I highly recommend choosing La Luna Productions for any videography needs because of Nico’s professionalism and care put into his work.

We didn't initially plan on a videographer, but my grandmother's health took a turn just a few weeks before the wedding. I still wanted to be able to share the day with her but we ...

didn't have a lot of time. Nico understood exactly what we needed and jumped on board with short notice. He was friendly, kind, and professional, worked seamlessly with our coordinator and photographer, and got us an amazing quality video on an incredibly tight timeline—and I was able to watch it with my grandmother. His contribution to our day and how we'll remember it has been invaluable.

regret was not getting the full package and getting two videographers. The video still came out amazing and we got so many compliments. But pay for the full package deal you won’t regret it. Nico was super easy to work with and very professional. We appreciate all the work he put into our video and will cherish it forever!

especially when planning the wedding, it took off a lot to stress knowing that he was on top of everything and we were on the same page. My husband and I were on a tight budget, we saw his beautiful edited videos and fell in love, unfortunately we were on a tight budget so we went with the raw footage but we are so pleased with his videos! He captured every single special moment that we needed and the image quality in the video is fantastic!! Nico is very professional and punctual, we were watching our wedding video within about 2 weeks of our special day. I highly recommend Nico to anyone looking for a videographer for their wedding whether it be those amazing videos he has on his site or raw footage he does great work!

, he did a great job of encapsulating all of the emotions of one of the best days of our lives. Nico is a true professional and is willing to work with you and your vision and make bigger and even more grand than what you originally planned. He just has a natural knack for choice shots/editing/music. Very simply put, he is very talented. The whole reason I went with Nico & La Luna productions is because I saw one of his wedding videos that was shared on Facebook, it literally brought me to tears, I was so moved by it. I knew at that moment, when I got married, I would hire him & La Luna Productions to do my wedding. I’m forever grateful to Nico and La Luna Productions. Now we have a lasting memory that we can rewatch whenever we want, highly recommend!!
