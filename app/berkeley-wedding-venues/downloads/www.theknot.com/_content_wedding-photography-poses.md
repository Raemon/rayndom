There's just something so tasty and comforting about diner food. So much so that this couple hosted their wedding reception in a diner, and the bride lightheartedly posed with her food to memorialize the occasion. 

### 38\. Just Married Celebration with Leaf Confetti

Don't you just love how this wedding image captures the energy and vibe of this couple's wedding reception? Modern wedding photos are all about capturing the moment—you don't need to have perfectly posed scenes and manufactured emotions in order to memorialize the celebration, as evidenced here. 

### 42\. Dramatic Wedding Picture Idea With Contrasting Black and White Details

![Offset Black-and-White Tuxedos With Classic Background for Two Grooms](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/ef0a4bf6-8338-4720-8da2-fc181e6287e7~rs_768.h-cr_22.0.1437.1886)

_[Photo: Lauren Mihae Photography](https://laurenmihae.com/)_

I'm absolutely obsessed with the juxtaposition in this modern wedding image. The wedding photographer's decision to place each groom in front of a part of the wall that his tux color was truly inspired. 

### 43\. Family Wedding Portrait

![Bride and Bridesmaids, Wedding Party in Regency-Era Portrait Room, Fashion](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/e1907696-ac0c-43a5-8b61-c27d7b54053e~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.706.941)

The sunglasses, the drama, the shadows—this modern wedding photo is *chef's kiss.* The bright foreground paired with a dark background gives an air of mystery and intrigue to the wedding photo idea. 

### 46\. Contemporary Wedding Portrait in New York City 

![Bride and Groom Posing on Street in Manhattan, New York](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/6b14e680-e630-456a-a9c3-265f0164e101~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1458.1944)

_[Photo: Jenny Futography Wedding Photographer](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/jenny-futography-wedding-photographer-nyc-new-york-ny-768384)_

I'm obsessed with the sense of place this photo gives—the cobblestone street and fire escape-clad facades are the epitome of Manhattan. Being willing to take a few risks, like momentarily stopping traffic to pose in the street, can result in super-cool wedding photos (as long as those calculated risks are taken safely). 

### 47\. Fresh Bride Picture With Billowing Wedding Dress

![Bride in Strapless Wedding Dress and Oversized Orange Hat in Vineyard](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/05f0e5ff-d299-49e1-b20f-f8145572153e~rs_768.h-cr_0.243.1458.2187)

_[Photo: Alternative Standards](https://altstd.co/)_

Most wedding portraits are shot from the front, but this modern picture took a fresh approach as the capture was framed from behind the bride. The movement of the to-be-wed walking, paired with the unique angle, is a fun reimagining of an otherwise-classic wedding portrait idea. 

### 48\. Astonishing Drone Beach Wedding Photo Idea 

![Beach Wedding Ceremony at Nizuc Resort and Spa in Mexico](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/a8cc4df0-97ad-45de-b1b1-749389baeda5~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1458.1944)

Individual wedding portraits of each to-be-wed are a must. The general concept and framing of this particular bride picture is traditional, but I love how fresh it feels thanks to the Golden Hour sunlight and the bride's smile. 

### 51\. Glamorous Full-Body Wedding Portrait Idea 

![Bride in Gold Lehenga in Open Field in Aspen, Colorado](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/facdd9f1-299f-4ddb-8e41-3e3b43d96618~rs_768.h-cr_0.55.1080.1495)

_[Photo: Kyle John Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/kyle-john-photography-chicago-il-623194)_

One of the simplest, but most important types of wedding photos? The empty ceremony shot. Before the guests arrive, but after the decor is all set, make sure your wedding photographer documents the scene. 

### 53\. Timeless Wedding Photo of Couple Laughing at Altar

![Couple Laughing During Wedding in the Japanese Garden at Fort Worth Botanic Garden](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/0affb180-b728-4ee6-9594-db763639e7fd~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1458.1944)

_[Photo: Vicki Grafton Photography](https://vickigraftonphotography.com/)_

"By the power vested in me…you may share a kiss." These words for the officiant precede an iconic part of the wedding ceremony—the couple's first kiss. This photo is one that shouldn't be skipped. Pro tip: Ask the officiant to set out of the way for the photo so that they're not in the background of the image. 

### 55\. Cheerful Wedding Ceremony Recessional Photo Idea

_[Photo: The Shepards](https://theshepardsphoto.com/)_

While you might not want to think about it, the wedding pictures you capture with elder generations at the wedding may be some of the last formal photos taken of those loved ones.

We love when wedding photographers capture the true depth and emotion of a couple's big day.

The emotions of the wedding day are felt so deeply by all and are not something that anyone wants to soon forget. That's why a good wedding photographer will make sure to capture wedding day pictures that embody a myriad of emotions—from happy tears to nostalgic tears and everything in between. 

### 80\. Mother and Bride Moment

Tender moments between you and your partner are not something you want to miss out on having captured in photos. Your connection is what brought you here and pictures (even tear-filled ones) will be cherished mementos to look back on down the road.
