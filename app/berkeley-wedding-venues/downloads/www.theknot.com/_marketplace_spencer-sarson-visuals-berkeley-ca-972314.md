About this vendor

Spencer Sarson Visuals started with my love of a good story. When I meet an interesting person or am told an interesting story, I immediately come up with visuals that would make that story more compelling. A marriage is the ultimate story. It represents all of the memories you've had up to this point. My favorite part about filming weddings is creating the visuals that accompany and show your story best!

Our wedding planner recommended Spencer as our videographer and I can absolutely say him and his work was worth the investment. I have watched our wedding film too many times to co...

unt since our big day just 6-months ago in 2024. I am just so thankful we made the choice to (1) get a videographer (2) that Spencer was our guy. From our first email exchange I could tell Spencer was incredibly kind, professional, and excited to work with us. He carried these attributes throughout our entire experience with him. On the day of our wedding Spencer showed up promptly and ready to get to work. He walked me through things, but because of his comforting approach I just completely trusted his vision! And I was right to do so. He worked very well with our photographer as they seamlessly got all the shots they needed. ( I believe it was the first time they worked together, too!) Our ceremony was both visually and audibly well executed. I was worried because it was outside and on a dock, but he captured it beautifully. When it was time for our reception and dancing he did an incredible job of blending in and getting incredible sound quality on all family and friends speeches working in a tent outside with lots of people. Our superb dancing skills were captured wonderfully. Lastly, I think he captured our vibes just right in choice of music. And the My only regret is that we don’t have a longer video to get every detail. We highly highly recommend Spencer!! Spencer, thank you so much for capturing our favorite day and telling the story so wonderfully. We are forever grateful for your hard work and excitement for us.

Spencer was a phenomenal videographer, and we are extremely happy that we hired him for our wedding! We found him while watching demo reels from various videographers in the Bay Ar...

ea, and both my wife and I really liked his style. He also came highly recommended from our photographer, Russ Levi, and they worked together as a great pair. Correspondence with Spencer was always very professional and prompt. On the day of the wedding he arrived early to get some scenic shots. He made sure to capture some absolutely fabulous moments of our wedding, and the final video he put together dropped our jaws to the floor with how amazing it was. It's a perfect 3:30 min video of our entire wedding day that captures the love, energy, and enthusiasm throughout the whole event. It's the perfect thing to share with family and friends who couldn't be there due to covid and to share on social media. It's something we frequently get the urge to watch because it's so beautiful. Spencer has my wife's and my highest recommendation for any couple looking for their special wedding day to be captured in a beautiful video for all eternity.

In a nutshell, Spencer and team were amazing. He had never met our photographer but worked seamlessly with their crew to capture every prime shot without disrupting still photos. ...

Ultimately, a Spencer on the wall. And the highlight video was PERFECT. Each time we watch our video, we relive our two special days. We are not the only ones who appreciate you and your team either. We continue to get compliments from EVERYONE on your lively personalities as well as your amazing videography/editing skills. Thank you for making our wedding days perfect Spencer, you exceeded all expectations and more. Look forward to working with you for any and all events in the near future.

Spencer is amazing to work with and captured our most precious moments! I wish I could give him additional stars. The day went by so quickly - I had no time to think about what wa...

s going on, and as a bride, you miss many of the details that you put so much time into planning. Luckily for us, Spencer captured so many of these priceless moments: from detailed decorations we made ourselves to the beautiful candid moments of so many important people in attendance (my husband's expression when he saw me for the first time - and my expression upon seeing him, my mom's expression while I was getting ready, me interacting with my maid of honor and bridesmaids, toasts, my tiny nieces/nephews rocking out on the dance floor, cake cutting, and bride and groom welcome/close). Hiring a videographer was something we went back and forth about because of budget. I am 110% glad I hired Spencer, because he's provided us with priceless memories. I am so happy with the footage, and the highlight video is just gorgeous. Not to mention, he returned our beautifully edited footage only three days after the wedding! Seriously amazing.

rofessional and easy to work with. Day of the wedding (May 14, 2016) I hardly even noticed him taking all the shots that he did, and our final wedding video along with the clips of the day turned out AH-MAZING! I highly recommend him to anyone! :)

ell. He is extremely professional, friendly and worked well with our budget. Spencer captured each moment beautifully and made the not-so-beautiful moments (i.e. the best man speech that was a little too alcohol-induced) flow perfectly in our highlight video. He has a creative eye and captured each detail perfectly. We couldn't be more pleased with how everything turned out! 5+++ stars!

captured every important (and unexpected) moment beautifully without ever interrupting or making it feel inauthentic. I've been in weddings before where videographers tell you to reenact something (which never looks as good) to get something on camera, and he never does that. They were always there but never felt in the way. He is polite and obviously very talented and experienced in what he does. I would highly recommend Spencer.

ugh his highlights clip. I highly recommend hiring him for the raw footage of all the important events that happen throughout the day! It is such a blessing to be able to relive the speeches, and dances, and CEREMONY! AND to top it all of, he is one of the nicest guys ever! He worked great alongside my photographer and his assistant. They made sure to not step on each others toes! We had ZERO regrets hiring Spencer, and neither will you!!!

Spencer was easily one of our favorite vendors during my wedding on May 28, 2016. There was something about his portfolio that struck me and when he responded with such a quick and...

friendly e-mail to my inquiry to see if he was available, I knew he'd be awesome to work with. We decided to go with his middle package for videography and then couldn't help but add on his slo mo photo booth package. It was just so hilarious to watch and I knew it would be a hit since traditional photo booths are starting to feel played out. On the big day, Spencer and his assistant Annie were on time and ready to roll. They were so professional and kept completely out of our way and the photographer's way but managed to get such beautiful footage. Spencer turned around our highlight video SO quickly - I want to say we were still on our honeymoon when we received the slo mo photo booth reel (HILARIOUS) and it was just a week later that the wedding highlight video arrived. He then mailed us this sweet, personalized box containing a thumb drive of all the raw footage so we were able to revisit our vows, ceremony, speeches and dances. Overall, we were just so impressed by Spencer from start to finish and really enjoyed having him and Annie by our side that day. I probably watch the highlight video every two days. I mean, how often do you get a beautifully edited video of yourself and your hubby from the best day of your life?! Thank you, Spencer! You're the best!

travel to Dolphin Bay Resort in Pismo beach for my wedding. He is very easy to talk to yet very professional. I had to meet all our vendors to get a vibe how they are to work with and we were very much comfortable when Josh and I first met him. He responds quickly and very flexible. I told him what music we preferred and what we want to see more of in the video and he listened. My husband really loved to have a lot of drone footage and so he made sure we got enough footage for the video. He far exceeded our expectations. We received many great compliments on how amazing our wedding video was. His work is perfection! We also got our slow motion booth from Spencer and that too was amazing work and was a blast at the reception! Spencer is very talented and in my honest opinion has the most unique and organic style compared to other videographers I've seen. That's what makes him stand out. This guy is just so great. If we can get married all over again I will pick him again. You will not regret it.
