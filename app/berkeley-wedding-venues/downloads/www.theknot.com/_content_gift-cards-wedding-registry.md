But are you wondering _how_ to add gift cards to your registry? And what's the etiquette behind asking for gift cards instead of traditional presents? Don't stress. We've outlined the most common questions about putting gift cards on your wedding registry. Use this guide to learn everything there is to know. Then, start your registry with [gift cards on The Knot Registry Store](https://www.theknot.com/registry/store/categories/gift-cards-and-experiences/gift-cards).

**In this article:**Can You Put Gift Cards on Your Wedding Registry? | Best Gift Cards for Your Wedding Registry | How to Add Gift Cards to Your Wedding Registry | Difference Between Cash Funds and Gift Cards

## Can You Put Gift Cards on Your Wedding Registry?

The short answer: Yes, you can register for gift cards (you can make a full-on gift card registry, if you want). In the past, asking for a gift card for your wedding might have been considered to be on the list of [wedding registry etiquette mistakes](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-registry-etiquette), but that's not the case today. Guests want to purchase items you'll actually use. Plus, you can register for both gift cards and traditional wedding gifts to give guests a bit more autonomy as to what they buy you. It's convenient for you and it makes using your registry easier for guests, since with only one registry link to keep track of, they're more likely to purchase the items you've preselected. Plus, a wedding gift card registry section is a great option if there's a big-ticket item you'd like to buy, but it's too expensive to add to your wish list. With gift cards, guests can help contribute to the overall purchase. 

## Best Gift Cards for Your Wedding Registry

Now that we've got wedding registry gift card etiquette down, it's time to start creating your dream wish list with some of the [best wedding registry items](https://www.theknot.com/content/best-wedding-registry-ideas). And yes, [The Knot registry](https://www.theknot.com/registry/) is for gift cards as well as traditional registry items. The gift card options cover nearly every interest, from buzzy brands like Airbnb, Delta Air Lines and HomeGoods to niche retailers like Pressed Floral. Can't decide which gift cards to go for? We're sharing some of the best gift cards for your wedding wish list below.

Whether you're saving up for your dream sofa or simply want some encouragement to treat yourself to some chic homewares postwedding, cash for Crate & Barrel is a great move when it comes to making a gift card registry for your wedding.

Airline vouchers are such a good gift card for wedding registries, we had two winners in the category this year. Southwest can help you travel nationally to 42 states as well as Puerto Rico, Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean. And thanks to their free checked bag policy, your gift card will be used just for the flight and your seats—we recommend splurging on first-class seats to live it up at the start of your newlywed life.

So, how do you register for gift cards using [The Knot Registry](https://www.theknot.com/registry)? The process is actually just like adding a physical gift to your registry (and as simple as the process of [how to make a wedding registry](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-registry-26-top-tips)). All gift cards live within their own category on The Knot Registry Store and they're broken out into smaller groups based on niche interests that you and your S.O. can browse.

## Difference Between Cash Funds and Gift Cards

The Knot Cash Funds (aka the [best cash wedding registry](https://www.theknot.com/content/cash-registry-the-newlywed-fund)) the best allow guests to give any amount of money to your registry. These funds can be used for anything—the sky's the limit. Gift cards, on the other hand, are more tangible items. You'll choose the store and amount, then that is how it has to be used. As such, they can feel a bit more personal than cash gifts. (Plus, you won't need to fuss with [wedding registry wording](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-registry-wording) explaining your cash funds' purposes.)

You can make a general wedding cash fund or designate your cash funds to a specific use, like a honeymoon or house. You can also put these monetary gifts toward shared experiences, like cooking classes, concert tickets or postwedding date nights—there's no limit to worthy [cash fund ideas](https://www.theknot.com/content/cash-registry-ideas). However you phrase the ask, at the end of the day, any contributions guests make to a cash fund will be deposited into your bank account for you to spend as you see fit.

You don't need to choose to make a full wedding registry for gift cards or go fully into [asking for money over physical gifts](https://www.theknot.com/content/asking-for-money-wedding-gifts). In addition to registering for tangible items, you can also register for gift cards, cash funds, honeymoon funds and charity funds on The Knot. You can include all of the above on your registry.
