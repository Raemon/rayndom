This wedding venue was absolutely perfect for us and Charlene and Taylor were the best!! They were super responsive, patient, accommodating, and organized. Here are all the reason...

s why Cinnabar was amazing: \- outdoor ceremony with a natural arbor with flowers (i.e. save on flowers/ceremony setup) \- half outdoor/half indoor cocktail reception for maximum flexibility and ability to bask in/hide from the weather \- indoor reception for hiding from the elements and a nice clean indoor bathroom \- the food really blew our mind! They have whole cuts for filet mignon cooked nicely to a medium rare \- super super competitive pricing \- remote as it's nestled in the hills but not so remote that guests have to drive hours to get to your wedding \- you have the whole day to set up! (Slash they actually set it up for you) \- flexibility for DIY things (we made our own centerpieces!) \- large enough ~200 people and a sizable dance floor for alllllll the dancing!! \- the venue itself is gorgeous and well maintained \- all of their recommended vendors that we used were amazing and had affordably competitive pricing \- most of all, having organized coordinators (Charlene and Taylor) can really ease all the pain and stress of wedding planning. On the day of, I was the most chill bride ever thanks to Charlene and Taylor!

After we were married outside of this venue in the courtyard, it was just a few steps away to our reception. We had our wedding reception here, and it was absolutely stunning. Al...

l tables, chairs, silverware, tablecloths, napkins, venue, and day of coordinator are included in the final cost. Prices vary on total guest count, we did the buffet-and the food was delicious! We had to provide our own centerpieces, decor, and name cards, but other than that everything else is included. We were originally debating doing an outside reception in a rustic barn, but after doing the math of all the rentals-and getting them to a random location-would have ended up costing us MORE than if we were to just use a venue (Cinnabar) that has everything included. All I have to say about the price, is that NOT HAVING TO STRESS ABOUT THESE THINGS (listed above) IS WORTH THE MONEY! Would recommend this venue to everyone-would love to do a family party or reunion here sometime in the future!

We had our reception at Cinnabar Hills and it was amazing. Our wedding was on the large side (250 guests) and Cinnabar was able to accommodate easily. We heard that the bar got a...

little crowded during cocktail hour but all of our guests were still able to get drinks after a short wait. The day was a little warm but the outside patio area was in shade and stayed cool. We went with a lot of appetizers, steak and fish for the entree, and a bunch of mini desserts through Cinnabar. All of the food was delicious. Given the size of the wedding, the staff did a great job getting food out to all of the tables. Especially with appetizers during cocktail hour, we didn’t have any issues in terms of our guests being hungry/waiting for food. Aside from giving our guests the options of food, there wasn’t much customization beyond the choice of entree (i.e. each guest couldn’t ask for his/her steak a particular way). We had one guest where we asked for no nuts on the salad, but it still came out with pecans on it. We went with some of Cinnabar Hills’ preferred vendors for music and the cake. This made working with them really streamlined as they were already very familiar with the venue and the staff. Also, the pricing was quite competitive with these vendors. Kim is on top of things and she will have your back the day of the wedding. She makes sure you eat, makes sure people don’t pull you in different directions, and handles all the coordination between the vendors. This was huge as it let us just enjoy the day. When we showed up at the venue, everyone was busy, but nothing was hectic. That was great to see everything come together.

also makes very nice pictures since you don't see residential houses in the background) I didn't think my husband and I would have as much fun as we did on our wedding day! Thanks to Kim, the event coordinator at Cinnabar Hills, and her assistant Aly - we never had to worry about anything and we were able to focus on enjoying the big day with our friends and family! From the initial meeting to the final details walk-through, Kim has been very patient, friendly, and super helpful! She offered great advices and tips for the wedding day. On the wedding day, she helped us keep track of time and she even let me know when my bustle came loose on my dress during the reception and she helped me with fixing it! The venue was very beautiful (we got very lucky with the weather - for early November!) and everyone seemed to love their food and house wines! I definitely recommend Cinnabar Hills to anyone who is planning for their wedding! =)

My husband and I looked at 9 venues and chose Cinnabar Hills due to its natural and bright look. Pricing, especially in regards to beverage packages, is superior to competitors and...

I also love that Cinnabar Hills only hosts one event a day - this gives you the confidence and freedom to own the day. During the planning stages, there were a couple communication missteps, but when it came to our wedding day, everything was perfect. The team did a wonderful job executing everything we had specified and making us feel truly special - thank you Kim! We cannot imagine having had a better venue for our big day!

I got married at Cinnabar Hills Golf course at the beginning of August and it truly has taken me too long to come back and review them because they were absolutely amazing. I'm a t...

ype A so get ready for some lists. Venue: The location is absolutely beautiful in every way. If you use them for your wedding I can promise you will have beautiful pictures. There is a garden court yard area where we took most of our pictures (esp. group shots) with lots of greens and beautiful flowers. There is also a huge oak tree up on a hill that you can go to that also provides some beautiful pictures with a more natural look. Our reception started at 6:00 so that 5-6:30 gap was the perfect time for picture lighting in August. Wedding Coordinator: Kim is the coordinator at Cinnabar and I can honestly say that she will make sure your wedding is perfect, how you want it, and most importantly she is amazing at making sure everything runs smoothly. Obviously she is a pro since she has a wedding pretty much every friday, saturday, and sunday. She knows how the flow should go, she knows problems that come up, she knows how the room is best used and how to deal with your vedonrs. Throughout the night you will just see her appear every once in awhile to keep you on schedule or see if you need anything. She even brought us drink refills! She is a complete sweetheart and a joy to work with. I don't know how she does it managing 10-20+ weddings at a time at least. The only reason I gave a 4.5/5 above on responsiveness is because you cannot expect her to respond to question you have if you e-mail her on the weekend. She will get back to you on Monday of the next week, but I doubt she is even able to get to her emails on days she has weddings, and really if it was your wedding day you probably would appreciate her not taking time away from your preparations to answer questions for a wedding that is still weeks away. Food: Best food I have ever had at a wedding, and I was told that by my guests as well. Also a great value for food and drinks in addition to cake packages from Cake Expressions (amazing cakes). There are several food options you can choose from and I would listen to Kim's suggestions. She knows best. Plenty of parking which is great. The space inside is really beautiful as well with high vaulted ceilings and windows all around. The girls also have a key-code locked dressing room with mirrors, vanity, hanging bar, couches, etc. Cinnabar was really perfect and exceeded my expectations in every way. I wish I could get married again just to go back there. Just to give a reference: for buffet style dinner with two entrees (one of them being fish), beer and wine unlimited bar, table overlays, cake, and obviously the venue our total cost for 135 people was about 12,000-13,000. In comparing to other places this is a great value.

decor that i brought and everything was set to perfection when i arrived later that evening. the venue itself is sweet and perfect for our rustic garden theme, and the food was delicious! they even put something off the menu together for my family that were vegan. over all, i highly recommend this venue. the price was extremely reasonable, staff was a pleasure to work with, the food was delicious, and the scenery was breath taking for pictures!

g to drive to a different location. The reception area is huge and had plenty of room for a photobooth, candy bar, DJ, dance floor, etc. They also include their own food and drinks you're really looking for an all inclusive event. The food was pretty good and well set-up. You also get a 2 wedding coordinators for your rehearsal and wedding day. I worked closely with the event coordinator/wedding coordinator (Kim Thomas) on everything. Kim and her assistant were amazing the day of the wedding. They stored and set-up all my DIY decorations, we worked together on a schedule,she worked with my vendors, helped my family with any concerns, and kept everything on track the day of the wedding. She was probably the best part of making our weddin amazing:)

as filled with windows and looked great at night. The event coordinator Brittany was very nice and easy to work with. The food was also delicious! The only thing that I didn't like was that they didn't give you any extras like food and drinks in the bridal suite before the wedding or food to go for the bride and groom after the wedding. After we spent so much money there I thought they might throw in a few extras, but they didn't. Other than that everything was great and I would definitely recommend this place.
