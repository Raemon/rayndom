I firmly believe that bridal shapewear is the best (un)kept secret to helping you look and feel great on your big day. The best shapewear for wedding dress wearers isn't about finding a way to mask insecurities and magically sculpt you to fit society's beauty standards; rather, it can help you dial up your confidence thanks to the wedding undergarment's ability to support, contour and smooth (and yes, that includes your [wedding dress bra](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-dress-bras) and [bridal underwear](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-dress-underwear).) 

Wedding dress undergarments have come a long way thanks to innovative design and product availability. So, if you're worried about discomfort or "sausage casing," don't fret, because the products available today are not your mother's shapewear. Now more than ever, it's easy to find functional wedding dress undergarments that are breathable and comfortable. And with how personal bridal shapewear is, many brands have even incorporated more inclusive shades and size ranges to fit a variety of different body types.

I even tapped my co-workers to help test out shapewear options to get better insights into how certain products fit on different bodies. Below, I've broken down the best shapewear options by style and dress type. Keep scrolling to shop my top picks and read reviews from real brides.

### *The Knot Reader Favorite* Best Shapewear Shorts for Wedding Dress: SKIMS Seamless Sculpt High-Waisted Above the Knee Shorts

![SKIMS shapewear shorts for under wedding dress](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/484a38ab-08ff-4271-9996-d98b4c56e142~rs_768.h-cr_243.0.1703.1946)

These thigh-slimming shapewear shorts are a favorite among brides and for good reason. They offer strong, targeted support around the stomach and thighs, while lifting and smoothing the booty. Since they're a bit longer than other bridal shapewear shorts, they also prevent thigh chafing. (Which you'll appreciate while you're tearing up the dance floor at your reception.)

**Editor review:** "I'm one of those people that rarely buys into products or brands with a cult following, I usually just don't get the hype. Well, I can confidently say that I now absolutely understand the hype behind [SKIMS](https://skims.wsktbf.net/9LqVye), and specifically these high-waisted shapewear shorts. They squeeze everything in effectively, but are also flexible and surprisingly comfortable." –[Hannah Nowack](https://www.theknot.com/content/author/hannah-nowack), Senior Manager, Editorial Brand Content

That's where Honeylove's SuperPower Shorts come in. Their superpower is providing all-day comfort through features like double-knit compression panels, flexible boning and an open gusset.

**Editor review:** "My ceremony dress was very form-fitting and showed off my curves in the best way. I wanted to feel the most confident on my wedding day, so I wanted a shapewear that would stay in place, smooth all the areas I'm insecure about, prevent any thigh discomfort, and wouldn't make me feel suffocated. The [HoneyLove SuperPower Short](https://honeylove.sjv.io/kOA4kM) checked all my boxes and has become my go-to shapewear!" –Emily Wise, Content Strategy Lead

Wedding shapewear doesn't have to provide all-over coverage. For optimal breathability under your wedding dress, go with something that provides support exactly where you want it. This bestselling thong, for instance, offers targeted compression around the waist to give you that coveted hourglass figure. It also comes in a variety of colorways that reflect different skin tones.

**Editor review:** "I didn't truly know the meaning of *snatched* until I put on the [HoneyLove SuperPower Thong](https://www.honeylove.com/products/superpower-thong?Color=Rose+Tan). If you're looking for shapewear that effectively and _comfortably_ eliminates both VBO (visible belly outline) and VPL (visible panty line), this is it. The hidden boning contours my natural waist with a defined hourglass shape under clothing, while preventing the shapewear from rolling or shifting. Tummy control shapewear can be uncomfortable to wear for a long period of time, but the pairing of the boning and targeted compression keep me supported without feeling like sausage casing. As for sizing, you will be sufficiently snatched and get a seamless look in your regular size, while sizing down would make this near-impossible to get on and could create that muffin top effect at the top or along the thong-line."–Nic Seligman, Content Strategy Lead

These aren't your average pair of painties (even though they might look like it). They're uniquely designed to flatter your figure through targeted compression and enhancement. Exposed spandex panels gently grip to the skin allowing them to stay in place all day. Not to mention, they're seamless so they'll go completely undetected under your gown.

Standout review: "These are my favorites! They are basically underwear that flatten and hold in your tummy. Super comfortable and full coverage on my booty! They are perfect for everyday wear." –Lesley, [honeylove.com](https://honeylove.sjv.io/JKZmLE)

Your wedding ceremony is likely the last instance you'd want to have visible panty lines. With all eyes on your back side as you walk down the aisle, you'll want to ensure everything looks as smooth as possible. That's where this bridal shapewear thong comes in. Its seamless design will leave you panty line free, with plenty of targeted compression around the belly.

**Standout review:** "I cannot recommend this enough! I held back on wearing some dresses or shirts because of the evident rolls or bumps you can see through the clothes. This shapewear does what is promised, and I have finally gotten back my confidence in wearing certain clothes after three babies!" –Amanda, [skims.com](https://skims.wsktbf.net/c/64733/618913/10056?subId1=TK-under-thewedding-dress-lingerie-essentials&u=https%3A%2F%2Fskims.com%2F&subId3=xid:fr1751907280959gaf)

When it comes to the best shapewear for wedding dresses, these shorts are high on our list. Let's break it down: Because they're seamless, they can go undetected under your wedding gown or everyday attire. Their light compression fabric works to reduce chafing and the appearance of cellulite while simultaneously offering a light butt-lifting effect.

**Editor review:** "I've found that most under-dress thigh shaping shorts are either just lightweight shorts to cut down on chaffing or have extreme hold but result in muffin tops. These [Leonisa](https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8213893-16964983?sid=TK-tk-under-thewedding-dress-lingerie-essentials&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.leonisa.com%2Fproducts%2Fstay-in-place-seamless-slip-short%3Fvariant%3D41220086169732) shorts seem to have magically found the elusive middle ground—they have medium-level support without being too tight, all while staying in place (thanks to the waistband's grippy material)." –[Hannah Nowack](https://www.theknot.com/content/author/hannah-nowack), Senior Manager, Editorial Brand Content

### Best Corset to Wear Under Wedding Dress: Dominique Brianna Strapless Low Back Corset

Wearing a corset under your wedding dress is a good idea if you want targeted support around your waist but would rather breathe freely everywhere else. It's also an ideal solution if a one-piece bodysuit just won't work for your dress silhouette. You can pair this low-back bustier-style corset with the [bridal panties](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-dress-underwear) of your choosing to round out your wedding undergarments.

**Standout review:** "Once you find your size, this corset is a hit! It holds everything together nicely and is super comfortable! I do recommend sizing down as my regular size fit a bit loose." –Ashley, [barenecessities.com](https://www.barenecessities.com/products/dominique-brianna-strapless-low-back-corset-8980)

If you want your bridal shapewear to target your belly, these shorts from SPANX are the way to go. They offer firm compression in the front and light compression everywhere else (meaning you won't lose any volume in the booty region.) Available in three classic shades, they're an ideal option for your wedding day, and long afterwards.

**Standout review:** "You know when you buy that perfect pair of jeans that slip on and fit like a glove? That's how these SPANX shorts feel to me. These are exactly true to size. They hold my mom pooch in and even give me a tiny booty lift." –Susan J, [spanx.com](https://spanx.sjv.io/POn64e)

Meet the wedding dress shapewear that does it all.

It has medium compression around the stomach and thighs, plus non-slip elastic bands to keep the shorts in place. Trust us when we say you'll be reaching for this product for years to come.

**Standout review:** "I purchased two of these bodysuits for my daughter and I to wear to a wedding. They fit perfectly and even made us appear slimmer! We were both wearing halter style dresses. The straps adjusted perfectly to the style of dresses we were wearing. It's also wonderful knowing we can change the straps as needed for any dress." –Kathy R, [spanx.com](https://spanx.sjv.io/6yzgnN)

This champagne-colored bodysuit certainly calls for a toast. Adjustable straps allow you to wear the bodysuit a number of different ways: standard, racer back, one-shoulder or completely strapless. It also has non-slip elastic bands around the legs to hold it in place. With moderate compression around the waist and a unique butt-lifting design, it will have you ready to walk down the aisle with confidence.

**Editor review:** "I knew that [SPANX](https://spanx.sjv.io/jeaOVa) bodysuits were known to snatch you in at the waist, but what I was not prepared for was the incredible lifting effect that this product had on my bust when I first slipped it on. That's all thanks to its unique padded cups (which completely eliminate the need for a bra, BTW.) Talk about an instant confidence boost. I'll be wearing this under all my dresses and form-fitting tops from now on." –[Sofia Deeb](https://www.theknot.com/content/author/sofia-deeb), Assistant Fashion Editor

For maximum coverage and support with minimum fuss, consider wearing a SKIMS mid-thigh bodysuit. It's easy to slip on and off. Plus, it's made from breathable material that offers compression without sacrificing on comfort. Choose from a wide range of sizes and eight skin-inspired shades.

**Standout review:** "When it came out of the box I clutched my pearls a little because it looked teeny tiny, but after some wiggling it stretched out to fit fine. It is very, very comfortable. It doesn't bunch, the legs don't roll up. Perfection. If you have boobs, you will probably need to wear a bra under. I'm a D cup and I definitely have to wear a bra with this, but it is still very comfortable and fits like it was made to expect that. Worth every penny, and I'll be ordering the low back version next." –Jennifer V, [skims.com](https://skims.wsktbf.net/zxO2R7)

Who says tummy-control shapewear, especially for a wedding, can't be chic and sexy? This stylish brief bodysuit was designed to flatter your waistline and bust simultaneously. But it doesn't just look great—it also offers seamless compression and support in a range of sizes. Plus, it's available in nude shades for every skin tone.

**Editor review:** "I'm not exaggerating when I say that my waist shrunk two whole sizes after slipping on this [SKIMS](https://skims.wsktbf.net/7aKJLO) bodysuit. It has been a total gamechanger for wearing bodycon dresses. Now, I don't have to worry about visible bloating throughout the day because I know the bodysuit has my back through targeted belly compression." –[Sofia Deeb](https://www.theknot.com/content/author/sofia-deeb), Assistant Fashion Editor

You put a lot of thought into choosing the perfect wedding attire. What if we told you that your undergarments could be part of a stylish and sexy bridal look too? Pinsy's elevated shaping bodysuits aren't just a supportive layer for under your wedding dress—they double as lingerie too. This pretty undergarment provides medium-firm support and has a built-in power-mesh bra.

**Editor review:** "This [SKIMS](https://skims.wsktbf.net/K0YO3N) bodysuit checked all the boxes when it came to what I was looking for in shapewear. It smoothed my midsection with a comfortable amount of compression to shape (could eat comfortably) while still lifting to counteract the unforgiving crepe material of my wedding dress. It's made of a thicker material, which is what I wanted for my winter wedding. Also, special shoutout to the open gusset, which I think is a must for weddings (don't get hot and sweaty plus can get back to the party sooner)." –Taylor Whitten, Content Strategy Manager

## What to Look for in Wedding Dress Shapewear

After spending hours (if not days) perfecting your wedding ensemble, the next step is finding the right undergarments to wear underneath it. Luckily, we're here to help you do just that. Here's exactly what to look out for while shopping for wedding dress shapewear:

**Structure:** When choosing bridal shapewear for your wedding dress, consider the level of structure and compression you want. "First and foremost, you want a piece that won't roll up or down," says Betsie Larkin, founder of [Honeylove](https://honeylove.sjv.io/dao7Yq?subId3=xid:fr1726837553484eec%7Cxid:fr1752191666260ffa). "Needing to constantly adjust your shapewear throughout the night is an unnecessary distraction and, frankly, not worth any of the potential benefits." Light-to-medium compression shapewear is made from lighter sculpting fabrics and provides gentle smoothing with minimal shaping. It's a great option if you want to feel like you're not wearing shapewear but still desire coverage. Higher-compression shapewear, such as bodysuits or corsets, can offer more firm control and sculpting. Wedding shapewear should never be too constricting. No matter the occasion, you should always be able to take full breaths and not have any loss of circulation.

**Silhouette:** Next, Larkin advises focusing on compatibility with your chosen wedding attire. Start with your outfit's overall silhouette. Slips and bodysuits are great options for anything from mermaids to slip dresses, as a continuous undergarment will help to avoid any visible lines or creases. "For a tighter-fitting dress, a thong style might be necessary to achieve a seamless look," Larkin advises. On the flip side, minimal shapewear works well with more loosely fitted attire (think: A-line dresses and ball gowns).

**Style:** Consider any other stylistic elements that might dictate what kind of shapewear you choose, like if your dress is backless or has a high leg slit. Surprisingly, there are lots of special shapewear options that can complement unique cutouts and necklines designed specifically for various dress silhouettes. For example, if you have a form-fitting sheath dress, consider options like a shapewear thong, which offer seamless coverage without visible panty lines. If your dress has a plunging neckline, the [Shapellx Backless Plunge Thong Bodysuit](https://www.shapellx.com/products/airslim-backless-u-plunge-thong-bodysuit) provides hidden support and enhances your natural curves.

**Color:** When it comes to color, it's often recommended to opt for shapewear for bridal gowns that come in nude or flesh tones to blend seamlessly under your wedding dress. "While we all associate weddings with white, if your dress is made of a thinner material, white is probably not the best choice," says Larkin. Look for brands like [Spanx](https://spanx.sjv.io/KjjkRa?subId3=xid:fr1726837553485dhd%7Cxid:fr1751907280961bch), [SKIMS](https://skims.wsktbf.net/c/64733/618913/10056?subId1=TK-under-thewedding-dress-lingerie-essentials&u=https%3A%2F%2Fskims.com%2F&subId3=xid:fr1751907280961aai) and [Honeylove](https://honeylove.sjv.io/dao7Yq?subId3=xid:fr1726837553485ebe%7Cxid:fr1751907280961dge), which offer a wide range of nude colors, so you can easily find an exact match for your skin tone. If your heart is set on white shapewear because it gives you bride vibes, then I say go for it. Just be sure to try it on with your wedding dress first to make sure that nothing shows through.

**Comfort:** Let's be real—no one wants itchy or tight wedding shapewear to distract them while they say their vows. "Choose something that is breathable, lays flat and doesn't poke or dig," advises Ratchel Pinlac, founder of [Pinsy](https://wearpinsy.com/). "There is nothing worse than feeling uncomfortable and suffocated on your wedding day." It's a good idea to test out your shapewear before the big day to make sure it fits comfortably. If you notice that your wedding dress shapewear restricts your breathing, causes pain or discomfort, leaves marks on your skin or causes bulges, this can be a sign that you need to size up.

## Wedding Shapewear FAQ

Still have questions about shapewear under wedding dresses? Read on for more expert advice to help you pick the best wedding shapewear for your dress:

### Do I have to wear shapewear under my wedding dress?

Of course not! It's all about finding the wedding dress undergarments you're most comfortable in. While some feel at their best in a standard set of underwear or some sexy [bridal lingerie](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-lingerie), others prefer the structure and support that shapewear has to offer. Really, it comes down to what feels best for you. You definitely don't have to wear a shaping slip, bodysuit or shorts to complete your wedding look. But if you think you'd feel more comfortable in an extra-supportive undergarment, go for it. Just like pretty much all your wedding-planning decisions up to now, it's about finding the right option for you.

### If I plan to wear shapewear on my wedding day, should I wear it to my wedding dress fittings?

Yes, you should definitely bring your bridal shapewear to your [wedding dress fittings](https://www.theknot.com/content/final-details-wedding-fittings), especially because it can affect how the dress will fit on your body. Wearing shapewear during fittings allows you to see how it looks and feels with your dress and ensures that everything fits properly. This way, any necessary adjustments can be made to accommodate the shapewear.

### How much should I expect to spend on wedding shapewear?

The cost of wedding shapewear can vary depending on the brand, style and quality. Basic shapewear options can start at around $30, while more specialized or high-end options can range from $50 to $150 or more. It's important to [consider your budget](https://www.theknot.com/wedding-budget) and prioritize the features and support you need when choosing your shapewear.

### Should I wear my shapewear before my wedding day?

If you plan on investing in wedding dress shapewear, it's a good idea to give it a "test run" before the big day. This will give you a chance to get accustomed to wearing it, check for any discomfort or fit issues, and ensure that it provides the desired level of support and shaping. You can wear it for a few hours at a time around the house, to a friend's wedding or on a date night leading up to the wedding to ensure its comfort and effectiveness.
