### Editors

As an Editorial team, we bring you the latest from the runway and the jewelry store. We cover topics that range from serious to stress relief. We test registry products and try on wedding guest attire. We feature real weddings, highlight amazing wedding professionals and showcase city guides for every event from proposals to honeymoons. We are just as comfortable sharing first person narratives as we are first dance recommendations. 

We're a team of in-the-know wedding experts. We tell it like it is and we have a damn good time doing it.
