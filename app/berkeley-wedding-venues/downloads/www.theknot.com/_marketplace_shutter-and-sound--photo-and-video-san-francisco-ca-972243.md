I hired Shutter & Sound to film my LGBT wedding in San Francisco and create the "The Short" which included a 3-4 minute highlight video and multi-cam edits of other key moments in ...

our wedding as well as add-ons for a 60 second Instagram Edit and Drone Coverage. To say I am an extremely happy customer is an understatement! The customer service from start to finish was simply outstanding. The team at Shutter & Sound made the whole process easy and I absolutely love our Instagram edit, our highlight video and the multi-cam edits. A huge shout-out to George and Dakota for being super friendly and easy to work with when filming on our wedding day. You made us feel very comfortable being filmed which is not something we are used to and your directing for artistic shots was very easy to follow and the resulting footage turned out amazing! The content you filmed and created in the videos is incredible! We will cherish these video memories for the rest of our lives. I am forever grateful for your videography services! Also, a special thanks to both Rachel and Kaitlin for the amazing engagement and coordination throughout the entire process. You both really tied the whole experience together seamlessly from start to finish. If you are considering videography services for your wedding, I highly recommend Shutter & Sound! Also, I highly recommend the drone coverage add-on. Having aerial footage of San Francisco in our highlight video was spectacular!

We used Shutter & Sound for our wedding on 11/5/2022 and we are so beyond happy with the results! On the day of, the two videographers were so wonderful! They were on time, worked ...

well with the photographers and other vendors, and made us feel at ease and comfortable (especially for a couple that doesn't love being in front of the camera). When we got our highlight video back, we were just thrilled- it came out even better than we imagined! They used amazing drone footage of the city we got married in, let us pick our music and really listened when we asked for specific things/shots (e.g. shots of our loved ones and the party). Overall, we cannot recommend them enough- not to mention, we go our highlight video back in less than 2 months. THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING!! It was so amazing to get to see our special day back.

ook too much time asking for retakes and us to redo certain poses, which took a chunk out of the day and started to feel unnatural. I also have never hired a videographer, so I am new to the feeling... They left pretty early, which is partially my fault for scheduling it that way. I wish they had caught more of everyone's crazy dancing towards the end of the night. That being said, If I had communicated better, I am sure it would have been seemless. I also LOOVVVEEEE our highlight video regardless... so the rest is all small stuff. Thanks Shutter and Sound!!

We highly recommend Shutter & Sound for your video - great pricing, and great people. Thanks again!

When the forecast for our wedding day showed some unexpected rain we were initially worried about how our videography would turn out. Jordan did not let the rain stop him and was such a good sport, running in and out of the rain and improvising so that he did not miss a thing! We highly recommend Shutter and Sound!

My wife and I love the video that we have now to remember our wedding.

ery start, Kylee was extremely attentive, patient, thorough, and helpful in guiding us through package, music selection, and wedding day decisions. She was easily accessible through email and by phone, accommodating every question and request we made. Kylee was a joy to work with and made the overall planning and logistical experience smooth and pleasant. On our wedding day, we met Austen and his lovely second cinematographer. They both arrived early, looked professional, and were ready to get to work. Austen and his second shooter were creative with their angles, perfected lighting and colors, and knew how to beautifully capture the moment without interfering. They made us, our family, and honored guests feel comfortable and most importantly, free to be ourselves. We appreciated how they worked collaboratively with our photographers under our strict time constraints, especially since they both needed to get their necessary shots. Our short highlight video was ready in just 7 days after our wedding. We were impressed, to say the least, with the quick turnaround time but also with the professional quality of the video. Austen and his team were generous with their time, even allowing us to make changes to our finalized product. After a few weeks, we received our highlight video, our multi-cam edit, and the raw footage in a convenient external hard drive. We will be sure to replay them for years to come as we reminisce on our wonderful day. We could not be happier with the Shutter and Sound Films SF team and we, along with my professional photographer brother, will be highly recommending them to our engaged family and friends.

o personable and great to have with you for 8+ hours!! It was less than 20 degrees the day of our wedding and our first look was outside. Eric made sure to get every shot he needed as quickly as possible without losing any quality. He didn’t waste any time planning his next shot or what he wanted us to do. He knew exactly what he was doing the entire time. Kylee, the Scheduling Manager, helped with all the “paperwork” and answered all of our questions throughout the entire process. She was so quick to respond to my emails that it was like we were having a real-time conversation! One thing I really liked was how we paid. It was through an electronic debit from your checking account and you could pay as much as you wanted, anytime you wanted, as long as it was completely paid off by the due date. With all the vendors needing final payments around the same time and mostly all requesting these payments via check, it was great to have the option to make instantaneous payments throughout the months on our own schedule. We received our highlight video literally FIVE DAYS after the wedding. How fast is that?! The video is absolutely perfect and we are continuously receiving compliments on it. We can’t stop watching it ourselves! The rest of our package will be delivered in the upcoming weeks, but I am so glad we already have the highlight. I love that Shutter and Sound allows you to purchase all the raw footage from the day. I know I missed out on so much and I’m excited to be able to catch some of it! This is in addition to the ceremony and speeches, which I also can’t wait to watch. So happy we’ll be able to have all of this for the rest of our lives—and this is coming from a couple who originally decided NOT to have a videographer. Love Shutter and Sound and am so, so happy we found them for our wedding day!

now husband and I went back and forth on having a videographer and we are SO VERY GLAD that we did. If you are on the fence, don't hesitate - you need Shutter and Sound in your life. Cody was our videographer and he was nothing short of incredible. He was so lovely to work with and made the planning process a breeze. We aren't local to MA anymore but Cody was not only flexible with our planning phone calls, but he completely took any worry/stress out of planning from a distance. He was amazing on the day of the wedding and made the process so fun. We just received our highlight video yesterday (just two weeks after the wedding!) and we are so obsessed. We have watched it 100 times in the past 12 hours and love it more every time. Cody captured our day so perfectly. We can't say enough good things about Cody, Quinn, and Shutter and Sound. We are forever grateful! Our highlight video for those who are curious: https://vimeo.com/311514185

I’m so glad we made the decision to hire them to do the videography for our wedding. Cody, our Boston-based videographer from Shutter and Sound was wonderful to partner with and produced EXCEPTIONAL work. We just received our highlight video and were BLOWN AWAY. We highly highly recommend using this company and requesting Cody (if you are in the Boston area). We had such a positive experience and are sure we will have plenty more to rave about when we see our full feature documentary which is scheduled to arrive in about a month.

moments that meant so much to us, even some that were such a blur that we didn't remember until seeing the short video. Video really conveys our personalities and the way that my dress moved, in a way that still photos didn't manage to capture. We didn't want the usual "getting ready" shots, and Alex is such a professional that he didn't need any extra directions to send us a perfectly-edited short video. (Also, it turns out that you can't use a drone in NYC/Brooklyn anymore, but they had amazing footage to use, so we weren't even upset.) We were so surprised to get the email that the video was ready while we were still on our honeymoon! It is just the right length (about 3 minutes) and it lets me re-live our wedding day every time I watch it.

t their respective homes, and filmed every moment leading up to the ceremony. During the ceremony they used multiple cameras in order to make sure they did not miss a thing! Same thing goes for the reception, where it seemed that they were always in the middle of the action, making sure to document each special moment. They captured so many incredible moments that went by in the blink of an eye, but that we will now be able to remember and cherish for our entire lives! When we received our highlight video a few weeks after the wedding, we were blown away!! Somehow, they were able to fit all of the most important moments into a perfectly flowing masterpiece that captured the essence of our wedding day! All of our families and friends could not stop sending us compliments in regard to how much they loved the highlight video. We are currently waiting for our hard drive of the multi-camera edit and the raw footage, but if the highlight video is any representation of what is to come, we are sure to be extremely pleased with this as well. Overall, we were extremely happy with our choice of videographer, and we would recommend Shutter and Sound of Boston to all our friends and families.

some initial details and BAM, I had my videography team within a few emails. They are clear in their instructions and process; I felt very taken care of and assured that I would be well taken care of. They have reasonable prices for really thorough packages. About a week before my wedding, i was contacted by the videographers that would work my big day and both David/Tony turned out to be such fun guys! You can tell they love their job and really want to get the best shots possible. They have such an artistic vision and my video has the perfect romantic yet carefree edit that I wanted.

From the very start, Quinn was so helpful explaining the different packages, all the way to gathering all the information needed for our big day. We ended up choosing "The Short" w...

hich includes 3-4 min cinematic highlight and a 1-2 hour multi-cam edit of ceremony and main events of reception, documentary-style. We also added on the raw footage. "Mike, Not Joe" was our main videographer and he couldn't have been more kind and calm, he made us feel so at ease. The other videographer, who started with the guys and who's name I didn't catch, was reportedly, "the bomb" and helped tie their ties and instruct them on proper tie clip placement. We received our highlight video, TWO, yes, you read that right, TWO DAYS after our wedding. Of course we had to watch it right away despite being in a brewery in Maine on our mini-moon. It left both of us crying our eyes out, I think I audibly sobbed. It's a masterpiece. My dad said it best, I think; he said they captured us and our personalities so perfectly after only knowing us for a short amount of time. And a friend said it second best; "Hunter Hayes WISHES that was his music video!" I've probably watched it about 50 times in the past 37 days since we've received it and have also thrown it up on a giant TV at work and showed 25 of my coworkers. Everyone that watches it cries and is floored by the quality and beauty and how fast we received it! We haven't received our long form video yet, but I'm sure it's going to be equally as amazing. Don't hesitate, hire Shutter and Sound! TL;DR 15/10 recommend. Absolutely incredible. Best decision we've ever made.

We've actually seen the two of them work twice now (once for a friend's wedding a month prior to our own, and then our own this past weekend), and each time, they captured high-quality footage both individually and together. We can't recommend Shutter and Sound enough, and we can't recommend these three highly enough. If you decide to go with them, you'll be in very capable hands.

e also very competitive and reasonable, you get alot!!! Our videographer was Michael and he was amazing to work it! Very nice and courteous and communication was superb. To be available like that definitely makes the experience that much better and enjoyable. Communication with the company is also great, through Quinn who takes care of the pre-event details. We are highly recommending them to all our friends!

ncredibly talented with an artistic eye. Our highlight video came back so quickly and looks like a trailer to the greatest love story ever told. The Shutter and Sound team was so lovely to work with answering our questions and making our day feel like a dream. Hans captured raw and real moments without ever getting in the way of them, made us feel very comfortable and put our video together beautifully. We truly can't say enough good things about Shutter and Sound.

Let's just say that I've been watching strangers' wedding videos since I was in high school. I absolutely LOVE them, so when my husband and I got engaged, I knew finding the most P...

ERFECT videographer for our big day was a top priority. We live in San Francisco, but our wedding was down in Disneyland, so we actually used The Knot to start our search for Southern California videographers. I pretty much spent a month researching a number of videographers, watching so many different videos, but I always found myself going back to Shutter & Sound. Well, we decided to book them. On the day of our Wedding, Alex was amazing! We were able to get a ton of shots and he never felt in the way. It wasn't until I received my video (which was just 2 days ago!) when I realized just HOW amazing Alex (& the 2nd videographer) were. The shots were PERFECT. They were better than I could have every imagined. He gave us a lot of directions on the day of the wedding and in the moment it was sometimes feel kind of funny, but he knew what he was doing because those shots were perfect. And then the editing of the video - AMAZING. I can't stop watching this video and everyone along with my husband and I are obsessed with it! This wasn't just a regular video, this truly was a piece of art and something SO special you can look back on for years to come of your big day. If you appreciate wedding videography and are as picky with it as I am, then Shutter & Sound is the company for you! Book them... you won't regret it!

t recommended we take a look at his company Shutter and Sound. After looking at some of Seth’s work and speaking with him over the phone, we knew we had found our videographer! Seth worked with us before the wedding to determine a videography schedule that worked for everyone and made sure he and his second shooter were prepared for our big day. Then on the day of our wedding, he worked extremely well with our photographer and did a great job of capturing the moment without inserting himself in the moment. Plus he was flexible when the weather didn’t cooperate and we had to change our plan! I was SO HAPPY with our experience with Seth on the day of our wedding – he and the second shooter were so pleasant and I’m so glad they were a part of our big day! After our wedding, we continued to experience great communication with Shutter and Sound. They were flexible when we decided to use a brand new song for our highlight video, and waited to create our video until the song was finally available. Then they completed our highlight video in a timely fashion and then quickly mailed our 3 blu rays and raw footage. We couldn’t be happier and are so thankful we chose Shutter and Sound to help capture our special day!

ect to their videos. They truly stood out to me from all the rest with the quality of their videos. On the day of my wedding, Michael & and his partner were great! They both had great personalities and what I truly loved most is they weren't in the way, they were just off to the side collecting this footage not knowing the beautiful work that would come of it. We got our highlight video less than two weeks following the wedding and I was STUNNED with the result. The highlight video moved me to tears all over again and the compliments we got from friends and family and even strangers were outstanding. For those looking for a videographer for their wedding I would just want to let you know how essential a videographer truly is. There is so much you miss on your wedding day and so many parts you want to relive, and having this video to look back on is such a gift. Shutter & Sound Films are phenomenal and my husband & I are over the moon with our video footage. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

ing, we realized we were below budget and decided to book a videographer. We are SOOO happy we did. Quinn was very responsive to our emails/calls and the contract was executed a few days prior to our wedding day. We worked with Mike and Joe on our wedding day. They were present for almost 12 hrs, and we did not even notice them. We received our video on our honeymoon and less than a week after our wedding, it was such a pleasant surprise! We have watched it almost 10 times and multiple friends and families have messaged us about how much they love the video. Some say it even looks like a music video. We strongly recommend Shutter and Sound! We got the package with 12 hrs of raw footage, 3.5 minute highlight video with dialogue.
