rocess, Elite Entertainment's team was professional. From the initial communication with the company to the final interactions with Brandon on the wedding day, their attentiveness and responsiveness were unparalleled. During my final details call, I was thoroughly impressed by Brandon's meticulous attention to detail. He asked insightful questions, prompting me to consider aspects I hadn't previously thought of, and left me feeling confident in his ability to seamlessly execute our wedding vision. The reception was a testament to Brandon's adaptability and expertise. When we had last minute changes to our initial requests, he effortlessly pivoted, ensuring the flow of the event remained smooth and uninterrupted. Brandon's playlist was exactly as we had discussed and he kept the dance floor packed all night long. Without a doubt, Elite Entertainment will be my go-to choice for any future DJ needs. Their commitment to excellence and dedication to client satisfaction make them stand out from others I’ve worked with in the past.

In advance of the event, he was so helpful as we finalized some small details, even creating special cuts of songs for us to listen to to make sure we approved of the portions he planned to play for various parts of the event. At the event itself, Josh did an amazing job from start to finish. He really was the anchor for the entire wedding, from guests arriving until the final song was played. The event ran impeccably, and guests danced until the very end of the reception. A good DJ ranks up their in importance with good food - it really matters at a wedding. HUGE thanks to Elite Entertainment and Josh for doing such a beautiful job!

DJ Brandon was the DJ for our wedding, and to say he knocked it out of the park would be an understatement. Brandon came prepared with the exact energy our event needed to make it...

truly unforgettable and to keep all of our guests on the dance floor dancing the night away. What my wife and I really appreciated about Brandon was how noticeably hard he tried to make our event as seamless and amazing as possible - and he delivered! Brandon was constantly helping us, asking for our input when convenient, and helping all of our other vendors work in tandem with his production. And this was only the stuff he did on the day of the event, not to mention his superb song recommendations throughout the planning process that helped ease our minds in finding the right song. Overall, Brandon and Elite delivered excellent service in every facet of our interaction with them and if you are looking for a DJ to make your event truly unforgettable than look no further than Brandon and Elite.

the right fit, but knew right away after talking with DJ Kevin in our introductory phone call that he would be perfect for us and our wedding guests. We didn’t want a huge party environment, so we were worried that a DJ would feel like too much. We expressed this to DJ Kevin beforehand and he reassured us he could match the energy level of our guests and what we were wanting. By the end of the night almost everyone was dancing and having fun which we weren’t sure would happen! We’re so glad we hired DJ Kevin as he provided lighting, announcements throughout the night, and played the best music for us!

he really listened to what I wanted. He arrived on time the day of the wedding and was able to set up so everything was on time. Kevin was very friendly and easy going, not stressful at all.

He was a great help throughout the evening, making announcements, working with the other staff to make sure everything ran smoothly. He checked in with us throughout the night to make sure we were on track. His song choices were great, he really stuck to what we had talked about and kept people on the dance floor all evening. Everyone had a great time. I would highly recommend DJ Kevin!!

ily emergency that prevented him from delivering the photo booth, we refunded all his money and apologized profusely. However, it is a little unfair to say that one star would be too much when the DJ, our primary service, WAS AS BEN MENTIONED ABOVE FANTASTIC. So when he asked for a refund on the DJ services as well, which he thought came as a package, we refused. As for the discount on a future service, we only meant any type of celebration. As you can see in any and all of the other reviews, this has never happened in the 25 years we've been in business, so just know that YES, we'll be there.

The company is thorough and makes sure you have the songs you want played for every important moment of your wedding day...I filled out their forms and also sent Kevin our playlists. Kevin did an outstanding job the day of our wedding -- from making important announcements, playing the right music to get our guests dancing and having a good time...to making sure the night moved along since we didn't have the venue for long. We gave Kevin a tip as a "thank you." Remember to tip your vendors! We highly recommend using Kevin.

DJ Kevin at Elite Entertainment was one of our favorite wedding vendors. I did not have a traditional wedding planner and thus wanted a DJ who could help move the wedding schedule ...

along and ensure we had time to do all we had planned. Kevin hit this out of the park! The ceremony was perfectly timed. We asked him for a special music set, a short 15 second clip as each groomsman walked down the aisle, like at sports events. He ensured the clips we wanted were at the right time location and transitioned between guys seamlessly. The speaker set up was perfect for all locations, the ceremony, cocktail, and reception all being in 3 different areas on one property. He was so responsive and open to our music specifics. He kept the speeches and scheduled dances going on schedule. My husband worked with him to plan a surprise performance that was completely a shock to me! He worked with Kevin on the side via email leading up to the wedding and Kevin did an amazing job keeping it a secret from me. He went above and beyond to work with our other vendors and really was an all star in organization of the evening. The dance floor was always occupied by guests with a great mix of music types for young and older people. My parents raved about wanting Kevin to DJ their next event. He really is an exceptional DJ and overall master of the event space!

of the wedding and he couldn't have played the role any better. We didn't see the dance floor empty one bit all night! That was one of the most important things we wanted for our wedding also, no empty dance floor. From the start of contact until well past our wedding, Kevin was very responsive and professional to us. Having a responsive wedding vendor is so important in building rapport with a couple and Kevin delivered this. He provides constructive suggestions to help plan the night go smoothly with other vendors based on a detailed worksheet that he provides for you the month before. He made sure all of our needs were met such as announcing important parts of the night and playing the right music to keep the night going. Thank you for being part of our special day! We couldn't ask for more, especially with the little CD mix at the end of the night. Kevin is THE man to have from Elite Entertainment. Take my word for it!

We had DJ Kevin at our wedding in September at the Hakone Estate & Gardens in Saratoga and could not have been happier. Elite Entertainment was recommended to us by friends who al...

so had Kevin at their wedding last year, which made them an easy choice that was also reaffirmed the other great reviews here as well as from our venue. Since my wife and I were fairly busy, we actually did all of the communication with Kevin via phone/email prior to the wedding. Throughout the whole process, he was extremely professional and responsive. We were provided with very well-organized worksheets to make communicating our music preferences super easy. Just by completing those and providing some examples of songs we wanted to be played during various phases, Kevin was able to craft an incredibly seamless event that fit the exact vibe we were going for. We had multiple guests tell us how much they loved his DJing after the wedding. Besides the obvious music/mixing responsibilities, Kevin was also incredible at all the other important aspects. He was there early, fully set up, and had no problems at all with some of the specific logistical challenges of our venue. There wasn't a single hiccup/glitch to the whole event (which I definitely have witnessed as a guest of other wedding/events). In my opinion, the DJ is one of the most crucial parts of the wedding. You spend so much time and effort planning all the components of the event, so it's really important to have someone who can make sure things go smoothly and very clearly perform MC duties so guests are able to know what's going on. I would highly recommend Elite Entertainment for any event and thank you, Kevin!

My husband and I chose DJ Josh at Elite Entertainment as our wedding DJ and we couldn't have been more pleased! DJ Josh provided ceremony and reception AV/music and did a great job...

working with our videographer and coordinator to make sure the audio was taken care of and the music was timed for the processional and recessional at the chapel, as well as working with all of our vendors to make sure things like our first dance, the cake cutting, etc., happened at the right times during the reception. Plus, Josh was fun, friendly, and willing to customize the playlist to fit our requests in. The customized CD of all of our songs from the day was also a lovely, personal touch. I can't wait to listen to the CD for years to come. :) One of our friends initially recommended Elite to us after not choosing them for their wedding; they said it was their biggest wedding regret, after having a less than positive experience with the DJ they ended up choosing. If that's the kind of impression you leave when you don't DJ a wedding, imagine the one you leave when you do DJ it! We were so pleased with the level of professionalism and attention to detail from start to finish with DJ Josh. If you're looking for an affordable and reliable DJ for your SF wedding, I can't recommend DJ Josh and Elite enough.

We had the honor of having DJ Kevin help us during the planning process, as well as being the DJ the day of our wedding. I originally interacted with DJ Turner and Kevin, and both ...

were super responsive and continuously followed up with me. DJ Kevin helped me for most of the process from the initial phone call, to filling out paperwork, and planning the wedding day. I didn't know what to fill out for some fields of the paperwork, and DJ Kevin was able to give great suggestions. Fast forward to the day of the wedding. DJ Kevin helped set up the mic and speakers for my ceremony. It was so seamless I didn't even know it happened until I walked down the aisle, which means everything went smoothly! Prior to the reception starting, he checked in with me on introductions (which was a very big deal in my family so I appreciate him checking in). My cousin helped with him the introduction due to difficult name pronunciations in my family, and he was complete open to that. Music was great during the reception, and he also took requests. My friends and family had a blast on the dance floor, and gave us great feedback on DJ Kevin. I can't stress enough how professional and easy to work with DJ Kevin. I highly recommend Elite Entertainment, as well as DJ Kevin. I also found their pricing to be very competitive, which was icing on the cake!

DJ Tony did an amazing job at our wedding! He initiated the phone calls to make sure our music and timeline were just right. He was very personable and professional. He definitely ...

made our night truly fun and memorable! Our music was a mixture of newer music and oldies- Tony was able to get an idea of our music taste via a survey and phone calls. The timeline flowed smoothly thanks to him, and our wedding guests loved that they were able to make requests! I'm so glad we went with Elite Entertainment and chose DJ Tony!

Recently had Tony as the DJ/MC for our wedding, and he did an amazing job! He worked with us a bunch before the big day to plan out what kind of music we wanted and how we wanted ...

everything to flow. The day of, he just helped everything flow so seamlessly; he clearly knows what he’s doing when it comes to weddings! He got everyone dancing, and was just super friendly and upbeat the entire time. He even made us a CD of the songs we had picked out, AND one of the cocktail hour music, which we missed due to pictures! I would definitely recommend Elite Entertainment, and Tony especially, to anyone looking for a professional, personable DJ for their event.

of the emails in between, to the special day with Turner, everything was perfect. These guys are so professional and amazing. I cannot say enough wonderful things about them. Turner followed everything that I wanted, played all of my favorite songs, and didn't miss a beat the entire night. All of the staff at the venue kept coming up to me saying how wonderful he was and how professional. Elite is the best in the business and you really should look no further when looking for a DJ. Thank you for everything!

omething you might not think about but Kevin helped the night move along smoothly and on schedule. Elite Entertainment asked all of the right questions once you book and are always available for more questions along the way. Music was a huge deal for us going into our day and Kevin absolutely nailed it. One thing we really liked was how well he did song transitions. Our dance floor was full the entire night and I know it was due to the fact that Kevin could read our party so well. If there was a song that wasn't quite keeping everyone out there he smoothly and quickly transitioned to another song. He was there to keep the party going but actually felt like part of the party because he was also having so much fun. We would choose Elite Entertainment time and time again, especially Kevin, for any big party we are having. They even made us a CD with all of our songs and favorites from that evening which was really thoughtful. We could not imagine our wedding without Kevin and Elite Entertainment. Easily one of our favorite vendors. Don't look any further fo a DJ/MC, they have it all!!!

d asks and requests. He was incredibly fun and professional to work with. He was helpful at solutions to potentially awkward situations, and his demo on their site was fantastic. However, due to medical reasons, he couldn't be the DJ at our wedding. He introduced us to DJ Ross to take over for him (like some previous reviews, this is a benefit of booking with a professional company—they provide the backup services and have all of your info available). And while we missed Turner, DJ ross was fantastic. DJ Ross was great at making last minute and even last second changes (like moving our timeline around and changing songs per our requests). He watched the room for cues to the mood, being funny to ease the mood or serious to introduce events (first dance, etc.). To top it off, he provided us with a couple of CDs commemorating our special songs as well as the songs from the list we provided (my husband was adamant about which songs were played at our wedding to keep the theme and the tone set—Ross did a great job accommodating that). All of our guests enjoyed themselves and the music, and so did we.

Elite Entertainment DJ'd our wedding on 9/22, and they did a rad job! (I will explain the lack of a fifth star.) We originally met with Turner. From the moment we arrived and disc...

ussed our wedding, our needs, our music tastes, etc., we knew EE was going to be the DJ company for us. We felt heard, like our wedding mattered to them, and they had the tools to make it happen. We booked them, including Turner himself to be our DJ! Turner was amazing! He was responsive, matched our energy, and even put together a special edit of two songs for my bridal entrance. A+! Unfortunately, due to *totally* understandable medical reasons, Turner had to drop out of doing our wedding. We then met with Kevin, who took over for Turner (one of the perks of booking a company, there's backup!) The day-of went mostly well. The ceremony was perfect! Kevin is an exceptional MC, handling introductions and the flow of the entire evening with wonderful tone and poise! The only thing we felt could have gone better was his reading of the room/energy during the reception and the playing of the songs we'd given him. Whenever he played the fast songs we'd listed, people were on the floor and digging it. When he played ones not on our list (including the wrong version of "You Spin Me Round," a song I was looking forward to) you could feel the energy drop. Additionally, we had to request that he play our slow songs at all; after our first dance (performed live by two of my family members, and a huge hit!) there were literally no slow songs until we asked to hear them, and even then, there were two back-to-back, not spread out. We didn't hear a lot of what we'd put on the list for him to play; it felt like he'd maybe forgotten to bring the list with him? Or just disregarded our choices? Not sure. However, despite these small qualms, I had a BLAST at my wedding and reception (and so I hear did the guests, though would they honestly tell me if they didn't? I don't know), so in the end, it worked out. But because it's literally the DJ's job to read the room and not have the bride and groom have to request he plays the songs the couple already gave him to play, it's four stars rather than five.

r of me leaving a message with good news, he had a few DJ's left and gave me the quote right then. We booked it and Kevin took over to get all the details for our event. Glad we did too because everyone else was unavailable on such short notice. During one of my calls to ask questions, Ross, who ultimately ended up being our DJ is the best!! Elite must have a deep bench like the Warriors because we were last minute and we got a real professional with tons of experience. Ross not only knew music, he asked questions and provided feedback to make our event more pleasurable. From early set up to closing everything down Ross had us covered, even the other vendors were commenting on how helpful he is. My namesake is a famous musician so Ross made a CD of music from my namesake, and he also made CD's of all the music we had requested. Thoughtful unexpected gestures like that, his charismatic nature, and helpful attitude made for a very fun event we got to enjoy along with our guests. Thank you Ross and Elite Entertainment for everything! It's no wonder you get 5 star reviews religiously
