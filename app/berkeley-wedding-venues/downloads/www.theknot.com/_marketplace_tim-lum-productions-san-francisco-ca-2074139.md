### About this vendor

Hey there! I'm Tim, and I'm passionate about creating films that truly touch the heart. A wedding film goes beyond the ceremony or the day itself. It's about the beautiful moments, the laughter, the tears, and the incredible journey you've shared together. My mission is to weave your unique story into a captivating film that deeply resonates with who you are. If that sounds like what you're seeking, I'd be thrilled to connect with you! My style is an authentic reflection of who I am – relaxed, easygoing, and always up for some fun. I live for capturing not only the emotions that bring tears to your eyes but also the elation, laughter, and pure exhilaration of the celebration. It's about preserving every ounce of joy, excitement, and love that fills the air on your special day. If you're ready to embark on this incredible journey together and have your love story immortalized in a film that reflects your unique vibe, I can't wait to hear from you! Tim Lum Productions operates out of San Francisco, CA.

When it came time to choose a videographer, my husband and I did our thorough research and we came across Tim! His previous work was the perfect style my husband and I were looking...

for. It's light, romantic, and breathtaking. We really also appreciated his professionalism throughout the process and he made the payment process really smooth for my husband and I. Our final product made us cry tears of joy because of how thoughtful he was when capturing important moments of our day while connecting it to our vows. His work was creative and beautifully done! I highly recommend going with Tim if you're wanting to capture your vows in a video recap. Overall, so grateful we found Tim and would highly recommend others if they're looking for a talented and professional videographer!
