r vision—and he brought it to life in ways we couldn’t have imagined. His eye for detail is incredible, and he guided us through every shot so we knew exactly what he was capturing—and the results were stunning! He was also incredibly thoughtful about our time and our guests, offering creative solutions to make sure we could enjoy our day without spending hours away for photos. The final images are breathtaking, capturing not just the location and décor, but our guests and the genuine moments between us. We couldn’t recommend Christophe more highly—his skill, creativity, and professionalism are unmatched. If you want photos that truly tell the story of your day, Christophe is the one!

We hired Christopher for our intimate wedding in May, and he was truly incredible from start to finish. Because we had a small wedding with just a few vendors, it was so important ...

to have someone who could communicate well and work seamlessly with our coordinator — and Christopher did exactly that. He was organized, professional, and made the entire day feel effortless. He captured every moment beautifully — our family, the small details, the candid emotions, and even made sure to get photos of our animals, which meant so much to us. The final gallery is stunning and so true to who we are. If you’re looking for a photographer who is reliable, easy to work with, and genuinely cares about getting the perfect shots, Christopher is the one. We’re so grateful we chose him and would absolutely recommend him to any couple planning their wedding.

If I could give over 5 stars, I would, because Christophe not only deserves it, but his work made my dreams come to life, and we will never forget the memories and story captured o...

n our big day through our photos. For us, the experience with his company and output is that pictures ARE worth more than a million, I am still taken away when I look back each time. Not only was the photography the most important vendor I was seeking for our wedding, but Christophe and his team were the most genuine vendors I worked with, which is important for the big day to feel comfortable because once it’s show time, things move very fast! We had the opportunity and privilege to also work with him at the engagement shoot as well, which is the best opportunity to meet/get to know one another in a “slower” setting where you don’t just go in for a photo session, but we personally went in clueless, but came out learning so much! Christophe will take the time to give and teach tips and tricks, and all you have to do is look the part! He also preps you for what he looks for as well as learns your needs, so then you are all learning each other and prepared for the big day. He was also very patient with us and communication was key, so we were all on that same page. If you have weather issues like we did for the week of the shoot (we are from out of state), the consultation meetings leading up ensured that we had sufficient locations and back up plans for any emergency or mishaps which is very reassuring. And don’t worry, there is always a plan with Christophe as he will be very up front on what works and doesn’t, for the best outcome so you won’t have to worry a thing! The bonus for us as well was building a warm experience with him, which extended until even after our wedding, and it’s been 7 months and counting! The relationship from start to end and beyond will be a continuous one for us as we plan to keep him within the family. This aspect is also rare in working with someone for a wedding. I learned a lot about Napa vendors through this process as well, that for the most part they are so personable beyond their everyday jobs, which makes the big day less stressful. As for the importance of photography, my husband and I are pretty shy individuals especially with photos can be nerve wrecking, and I personally do not know every single tip and trick to all there is to know about “perfect” photography, but I’ve always just known what is good to my eye. Believe me, you can feel and tell with Christophe’s work when you run through the portfolio, do your research and I can also strongly attest that what you see is what you will get if not more, as there is no staging these moments, which is the scariest thing. However, his specialty is candid moments, and sadly you will find photographers out there who only put together the best of their portfolio for their webpage and in certain jobs, and not necessarily for every job or more importantly, for your big day. So be on the lookout for those and an engagement shoot is the best way to find out what you will receive for your big day. You can get your typical “one two three say cheese” type of photos, but that was not what I aimed for due to shyness and style, but you will get the candid experience which is what I had hoped for, and not being local to California, I also had high hopes to capture the scenery, to be able to look back and reminisce that special day because that day goes by so fast and you hardly have a moment to relive it without the help. Be sure to have someone in your family help “wrangle” all the members, and be ready to have a list and schedule sent out for everyone including the photography team so that the day goes the most smooth. It’s going to go by very fast and you may not have all the time or things can come up so rank your most important moments and photos on the list accordingly. I would also highly recommend a second photographer if you have a larger party , as they are also trained in the same way Christophe works and so you will receive the most out of your day while he captures the most with the bride and groom. As long as you are prepared with a list and schedule, you have had the chance to try an engagement shoot, you should have all the ingredients needed for your big day. The process is long after the wedding in choosing the most carefully curated finalized photos, but you will work closely with Christophe and he has the most eye for detail, and the teamwork is wonderful! They say that if you can find a photographer with a few photos that you love, you should be satisfied, but I received so many more I couldn’t even choose. My house is now filled with the most memories that I will never forget and I can’t wait look through the album and share with everyone! Christophe, thank you for the passion in your work, it not only shows but words can’t express how much we really appreciate everything you have given us. This has been the most memorable experience and we can’t wait to continue even more memories. Your kindness is also appreciated, makes the whole process easier and we are so glad to have met you! Napa is so lucky to have your service and if we could have you in Arizona we would! Thanks again!

arency and slow response times of vendors incredibly frustrating. Christophe was the only exception; he got back to me within an hour of sending an inquiry. His pricing and options were clear and reasonable from the start. Even after I told him that we were considering an elopement instead, he was very understanding and flexible and suggested a 1 hour photo shoot option within our budget. He made the whole process much less stressful. He even suggested location ideas, which took away the stress of those small details. On the day of our wedding he was on time, professional, and gave us some tips and direction on how to take good photos (which my husband and I both needed because we hate taking pictures.) We had a joyful, fun, and relaxed photo shoot, and our time with Christophe added to the beautiful memories of our wedding day. We got the digital proofs back in less than two weeks. My only regret was not paying for more time/pictures. I would highly recommend Christophe as a photographer and I’d happily book him again for another special occasion.

The vendors we chose really added to the “chill” good vibes day that we envisioned for our special day. Christophe and his son were on time, professional, on top of things, and paid attention to detail. He did a fantastic job advocating for the shots that he knew would be most important. Looking back, it would have been so easy to miss those moments. We appreciate him speaking up.

He was easy to communicate from the beginning, took the time to chat with us over zoom, asked us for a list of portraits we would like, and got information about the venue. On the day of the wedding, he was timely, organized and positive throughout the day. He has a very polite and positive attitude, which makes it easy for people to follow his directions. His positivity also eases the stress of the wedding day, we felt like we could trust him. One thing we loved about our photos was how he used light and movement with proficiency. Our sunset photos were beautiful and in our dancing photos, I can almost feel the movement. He also delivered our photos in his promised time. We are very happy to have worked with him and we highly recommend him.

Christophe was the photographer for our wedding in Napa, Ca. on 4.22.22. We are from San Antonio, Texas and found Christophe through our internet search. He is an amazing person....

He is friendly, kind, thoughtful, easy to work with, reassuring, and he listened to our needs and wants in capturing our wedding memories. Our venue was Merryville Winery. Our wedding location was simply breath-taking. Christophe did a brilliant job at capturing our love, our family and friends, our ceremony and dinner, and his pictures are as breath-taking as our venues. He is creative and provided amazing recommendations for pictures throughout the day. This is important because our focus was on wedding preparations, making sure everything and everyone was in place at the right time. Through his pleasant demeanor and creativity, capturing our day was the one thing we did not worry about, at all. His professionalism was equaled by his warm, caring personality, and transparency with his contracting process. Simply put, he exceeded our expectations. Christophe is a wonderful human-being. We recommend him without hesitation or second thoughts.

nestly didn't spend much time looking for photographers after finding Christophe early on, though. Every email and phone call we had with Christophe was stress-free, he helped put us at ease (even with details of our elopement that had nothing to do with photography), and even gave us several suggestions on venues for our elopement (we got married at one of them!). Despite Christophe's many well-deserved amazing reviews, we were nervous about working with a photographer we hadn't had a chance to meet in person (thanks, pandemic...). On the day of our elopement, however, all of those nerves subsided immediately. Christophe was at our venue early and assured us that he would give us all the feedback we needed to ensure our pictures turned out great after we shared that we didn't feel very natural posing in front of a camera. Working with him was very easy - he was friendly, passionate and energetic, gave us all the feedback we could ever hope for, showed us a few of our pictures along the way, and even gave me a quick pep talk before we officially started shooting telling me that I looked great, happy, and had every reason to feel confident in front of the camera. He has a great eye, isn't afraid to get creative, and even took some of our novice suggestions and ideas (some of which weren't half bad!!). We were finally able to download our photos recently and are so happy with them...they make us laugh, smile, and relive some of the best memories we've been able to create despite this pandemic, raging wildfires, and general unease in the world right now. We are so grateful Christophe was a part of our day and can't wait to find excuses to work with him again!

ur wedding photos truly exemplify this. My husband and I got married at San Francisco City Hall, and to our surprise, we picked the day that the mayor was to be sworn in; thus, many areas of San Francisco City Hall were closed to the public. Needless to say, I was extremely worried that our wedding photos would be limited and we would not be able to capture what we intended to. Christophe went above and beyond utilizing all of the areas we had access to, and our wedding photos were nothing less than perfection, and were not limited in the SLIGHTEST. Honestly, my wedding photos went far beyond my wildest expectations. If you are looking for someone to capture your wedding day, look no further. Not only is Christophe's photography flawless, he is unbelievably professional and is truly a wonderful person to work with. I can't wait to work with Christophe again in the future.

Christophe was the only one who offered to sit down and chat about what we were looking for/our needs, etc. He has a beautiful studio up in Napa and it was well worth the drive to go talk to him in person. We opted for the photography package that included an engagement photoshoot, which I highly recommend. He was super flexible about when we wanted to do the shoot and he was early (we were late, sorry!). He came prepared with hairspray for me too! Christophe checked all the boxes and more. He had a positive attitude and was always willing and eager to try new things, even if they were silly ideas. Aside from his shots coming out beautifully, he is an absolute delight to work with. My only regret is that I did not get a photo with him because I would've loved to have that as a memory to keep in my wedding album- our awesome, A++++ photographer!

Christophe is a fantastic photographer and we immensely enjoyed working with him for our wedding. He is a master of his craft and we would recommend him to any other couples lookin...

g for a photographer for their wedding or any other event. In particular, we thought he excelled in 3 areas: 1) creating natural moments through technical skill and artistic vision, 2) providing his thoughts on what looks good versus just taking orders, and 3) working with us both professionally and engaging us on a personal level, which made us much more at ease and really get to know him better. For the natural moments element, we loved all the pictures he provided. If you look through his website or any albums provided, you can easily tell they are well framed and technically well-produced, but also they really bring out the subjects in a natural environment. This is something we looked for in particular for our wedding photographer, and in both the engagement session and wedding day pictures, we thought that showed itself in spades. In addition, we also appreciated how Christophe balanced incorporating our wants and interests, of course, with his own style and experience. He did an excellent job of meshing both sets of ideas together into one cohesive, thoughtful set of pictures and telling a wonderful, lasting story through the pictures themselves. Truly strong kudos to Christophe here. Lastly, we very much enjoyed working with Christophe. Beyond just the output of the engagement and wedding shoots, we loved working with Christophe. From the first Facetime chat with Christophe through our last pictures with him during our wedding, we both really enjoyed working with him and getting to know him (and his son, who he brought to our wedding and also took some awesome pictures!). At the end of the day, you want to make sure you trust and know your photographer and we thought Christophe did an amazing job of facilitating that with us. Overall, we would thought Christophe was excellent on all dimensions and highly recommend him to others seeking wedding photography – and other occasions!
