Jen DM

DJ

Born in New York and raised on a steady diet of freestyle, hip-hop, new wave, no wave, and punk, Jen DM is a sonic shapeshifter with a deep love for the sweat, soul & rebellion whose sound lives at the intersection of queer desire and dance-floor liberation. As a young queer adult, she found church at the infamous Body & Soul parties in TriBeCa, baptized by the thump of house, the shimmer of disco & the communion of strangers moving as one. That early joy set the tone for a devotion to the pulse of queer house, techno & club music. Jen is one half of the electropop duo Hi Fashion, whose decade-long international run included high-voltage tours and TV/film syncs that brought their glittery, gender-bending music to the masses. Jen has performed on stages from Sydney Mardi Gras to Milkshake Festival Amsterdam, from Berlin’s Yo! Sissy to BAM in Brooklyn, and has shared the bill with icons like Peaches, The Blessed Madonna, DJ Holographic and Hercules & Love Affair.

Christensen Sanders

DJ

Bay Area party rocker Christensen Sanders is better known as DJ Swang, a nod to his Southern accent and charismatic personality. Sanders developed his craft as a college student in Chico before spreading out to L.A. and the Bay. He sets it off weekly at 44 Bar and Halftime Sports Bar, chopping up a kaleidoscopic mix spanning hip-hop, soul, funk, jazz, Latin, old-school and top 40. Sanders began performing at weddings when admirers approached him about bringing his club-level skills to their dance floor. He’s enjoyed the challenge, tailoring each wedding to the tastes of his clients and reading the room like a old poker pro. As E-40 once rapped: “Doors open mayne, now watch ‘em swang….”

Richard killed it. Great communication, professional, took a couple requests, played all our "must plays" etc... but most importantly THE MIX ROCKED. He's actually mixing live, not...

just playing tracks with some automated beat matching. He actually made a mix of one of my favorite songs that I like better than the original (https://www.mixcloud.com/AllEarsDJ/murder-on-the-dancefloor/). Kept people dancing for a solid 2.5 hours. HIGHLY recommend, especially if you want something more interesting than pop hits all night.

He learned our favorite song to play as I walked down the aisle (a moment I’ll never forget), and even serenaded us during a private cliffside first dance—something straight out of a dream. He read the room all night, keeping the energy high and the vibe exactly right. Truly a one-of-a-kind experience—we’d recommend him in a heartbeat!

ably priced for the value you get. Aaron was a master DJ who took our vision and guidance songs to create a set that was better than we could’ve imagined - smooth transitions, great flow, and kept the energy up late into the night - dance floor was packed the whole time! Daniel’s accompaniment on the sax was also a game-changer, bringing a touch of masterful live performance to the range that Aaron was spinning. Could not recommend more!

Richard was helpful and respectful throughout our entire wedding planning process. He worked flawlessly with me, my partner, and our wedding planner to pull off an incredibly fun r...

eception. Richard did an initial call with my partner to discuss the general vibe we were looking for, and we knew immediately he would be a great fit for our wedding. Richard gave us a helpful questionnaire to fill out key songs and general musical interests (and do not play songs). Richard was also happy to jump on calls with us to talk through our questions and hopes for our big day. I especially appreciated that Richard was able to play some German songs for some guests who had flown in from Germany, as that got even some of our older relatives on the dance floor. People were partying all night thanks to Richard! Richard catered to our wide age range of guests, and even gave us a couple of bonus closing songs that were the perfect conclusion to the night. We could not have asked for a better DJ.

We wanted the dance floor to be fun and packed all night, and Richard definitely delivered the fun energy! Our dance floor was crowded all night and the guests loved the vibes that the DJ brought.

Richard was great. He had a form that we filled out about a week ahead with music selections and do not plays. It was very thorough. He responded quickly when we reached out to hi...

m with questions. The music selection was mostly on me because my husband generally listens to instrumental. I listen to a wide variety of music, so I left it pretty open ended, which I was a little nervous about, but Richard pulled it all together. An eclectic mix, yet cohesive. We had a much smaller turn out than we were expecting and even more dropped out last minute, my guess is because of the weather. It was an outdoor venue and was rainy and cold all day, but managed to burn out by the time the party started. Only raining briefly after dinner (we had umbrellas for everyone). The music selection was great and everyone rallied and had a good time. The last song was All You Need Is Love and a kick line formed with the remaining friends and family. It was ridiculously amusing. 10/10 would recommend Richard to anyone. I spent a good amount of time listening to his mixes on Mixcloud and have really enjoyed them.

Working with AllEars was a fun and easy experience. Richard is an extremely talented musical professional and he made our wedding “the best wedding I’ve ever been to” -- according ...

to a lot of our guests (which was not expected!). We sent him a playlist of about 50 songs, and he seamlessly wove them together throughout the evening beginning with a cocktail hour vibe, and then moving into a fun party-dance vibe. He seems super flexible and able to go with the flow of requests without making things sound abrupt, and he comes free of corny jokes like some DJ’s I’ve experienced :) Richard really made an already wonderful night more wonderful, and I would 100% hire him again for weddings, anniversary parties, or birthday parties. The value of having a DJ on the wedding day was huge: we had someone to announce the speeches in a way that made everyone pay attention, we had someone responsible for keeping the energy up throughout the party, and we had someone with great taste choosing songs. I highly recommend a DJ for a wedding, if you want to kick back and let the guests have a great time!

During the wedding day, he helped things run smoothly with his MC skills and kept the party going on the dancefloor. Additionally, we loved being able to use their Funktown Photobooth services (which was COVID friendly), and his wife, Jalyn, ran it so smoothly!
