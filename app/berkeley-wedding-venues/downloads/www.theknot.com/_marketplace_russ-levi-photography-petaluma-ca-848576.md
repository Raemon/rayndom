Owner

My name is Russell and I still make funny faces in photos. I’m a silly sarcastic sweetheart (who apparently loves alliteration). I split my time between the Bay Area and San Diego and photograph weddings in both of them and really anywhere in California. I’m a big fan of visiting foreign lands and sampling their ice cream. I think puns are the highest form of comedy and geography trivia is the root of all knowledge. You’re highly intelligent for taking the effort to read this sentence, and hope you like my images.

I cannot say enough good things about Russ. He was amazing from start to finish- super easy to work with (we do not take a lot of pictures together as a couple, and everything was ...

so natural), and the photos were stunning. We were able to have as much input as we liked, but could defer to an expert in terms of the flow of the day and the best pictures to capture! We could not have had a better photographer to capture our special day- our photos were jaw-dropping. I also loved how enthusiastic Russ was to photograph all the animals in our wedding!

mediately drawn to how vibrant, natural, and full of life his photos looked. From the very start, Russ made us feel completely at ease. He has an incredible ability to bring out your best angles and most authentic selves — we felt confident, relaxed, and honestly had a ton of fun during every shoot. The results blew us away. These are hands-down the best photos we’ve ever had of ourselves — we’ll cherish them forever. Our family and friends can’t stop raving about them either. If you’re considering working with Russ: do it. You won’t regret it.

Russ is absolutely incredible and was one of the best decisions we made throughout our wedding process! We worked with Russ for both our engagement photos last year and our weddi...

ng, and both experiences exceeded our expectations. Our wedding photos are absolutely stunning — he delivered over 1,800 beautiful images that perfectly capture the emotion and joy of our special day. You can truly feel the love and happiness in every shot. What sets Russ apart is his dedication to his craft and his clients. The weekend before our wedding, he went above and beyond to help prepare by second-shooting a wedding at our venue specifically to scout the lighting for our wedding photos. This level of commitment is unmatched and really shows how much he cares about delivering the best possible results. Throughout the planning process and on our wedding day, Russ was completely professional and worked seamlessly with all our other vendors. He captured all the moments that mattered most to us, and his style beautifully reflects the emotion of the day. As an added bonus, he delivered our photos quickly and his editing work is fantastic. We cannot recommend Russ highly enough — if you want a photographer who truly goes the extra mile and delivers incredible results, he's your guy!

She came prepared and professional, seamlessly managing big group shots with our families and making sure to capture all the important moments throughout the day. Even though our ceremony was outdoors at a venue she had never shot at before, she handled the tricky lighting beautifully and delivered stunning results. We were blown away when she sent us the preview gallery within a week. The photos were breathtaking. Alex exceeded all our expectations, and we truly couldn’t have asked for a better photographer.

ce added to our wedding day. I actually approached Russ with an unconventional request for the morning of our wedding — my husband and I wanted to read our vows privately, in our hotel room bed, in our jammies. He said he'd never done something like that before but he was up for it! When he showed up to our room (at 8 a.m. sharp), I started to wonder if it was too weird and if I'd made a mistake. I was worried I'd be too conscious of him being there and it would take away from the intimacy of the moment, but once we started reading our vows, I honestly forgot he was there. He somehow made himself invisible; he was subtle, respectful, gentle, and he executed my vision flawlessly. I'm so glad I trusted him to capture such a private and personal moment. I was equally impressed with his performance at the wedding later that day. I didn't realize how much of wedding photography is actually people management lol. Our family photo time started to get a little chaotic and Russ stepped up to the plate, kindly yet firmly directing people where to go and getting everyone organized in what seemed like a fraction of a second. We probably spent more time with Russ that day than anyone else. He was with us when we were getting ready that afternoon, during the ceremony, during family photos and couples photos, and during the reception. Like I said, it was a joy to have him around. He brought an excited and fun yet encouraging and calming energy to our time together, and it made my husband and I feel at ease. Our one-year anniversary is next week, so naturally I've been spending lots of time looking at our photos. Russ captured us as a couple so perfectly — they really feel like us. I love how he did a mix of classic poses and creative shots, leaning into the natural surroundings at our venue. Looking at the photos instantly transports me back to that day and time — I feel the same butterflies in my stomach as I did that day, I can feel how happy we were, how supported and loved we felt. It's a gift my husband and I will cherish for the rest of our lives. You won't regret booking Russ for your own special day!

to reach out to him. After an initial consult, we chose to go with Russ. We first met Russ at our engagement shoot. We are both relatively shy and uncomfortable in front of the camera, but Russ made us feel at ease. We love our engagement photos and love our wedding photos even more. Russ was so easy to work with on the wedding day - he was on time, communicative, and helpful. He kept our family photos moving and helped organize guests for photos. Our guests even commented on how great Russ was at the wedding. He delivered a (very large) sneak peek within just a few days of the wedding. Overall, Russ is a great guy and an amazing photographer. We would highly recommend Russ to anyone looking for an engagement/wedding photographer!

I wish I could give six stars. Working with Russ Levi Photography was a perfect experience from start to finish, beautifully capturing my proposal to my partner, and giving us imag...

es and memories we will both remember forever. Russ dedicated significant amounts of time to me prior to my proposal date, discussing details and logistics in great depth and detail. He utilized his expertise to give me very helpful guidance regarding the exact proposal location up on Mount Tamalpais, in my hometown Marin County. He showed me examples of his previous sessions, and made me feel comfortable and confident all throughout. On the day of my proposal, I learned how talented and personable Russ' partner, Alex, is with a camera! Alex stepped in to photograph my proposal on the day of, when a health matter prevented Russ from photographing the moment (life happens!). I was very impressed by Alex's ability to step in and support on the day of. She arrived at the location well in advance, to give me the opportunity to practice and to take some sample shots. When it came time to propose, she captured our very favorite pictures of ourselves both during and after. Alex photographed us through a mixture of guided poses and candid moments. She made my partner and I feel relaxed and joyful from start to finish, and was happily willing to take an hour's worth of pictures of us! Afterwards, my partner and I were thrilled to receive a very generous service on Russ' part, in the form of him giving us over three times the number of edited pictures on top of what I had paid. He did this as a thank you for my flexibility on the day of the proposal, but all I felt was gratitude for both of them. Russ even performed higher-level retouching for us on a handful of images where we loved everything about them except for some stray hairs :) The photographs we received are beautifully vivid, colorful, and captivating. As an amateur photographer myself, I am nowhere near their skillset but have an eye for high quality work, and they more than delivered. I would wholeheartedly recommend working with Russ Levi Photography for any professional service, and I really hope I have the opportunity to work with them again in the future!

We are so beyond thankful that we had Russ Levi as our wedding photographer!! From the very first meeting, he was so kind and clear that he wanted to help fulfill OUR vision. We ...

definitely wanted to share with all the couples out there about our wonderful experience with him. Russ was super fun to have for our big day. The bridesmaids love to joke around, and we were being silly throughout our “getting ready” time. Russ captured our ridiculous personalities, and was even game to jump in with a joke or two. When it came to photographing the wedding ceremony and reception, we were so delighted to see the pictures because we have a great balance of the typical photos you expect to see (walking down the aisle, kiss, formal family photos, speeches, first dance, etc.) but also some really sweet yet unexpected moments (a young cousin napping, us newlyweds cracking up at a ceremony mishap, guests dancing up a storm, us being competitive at a Street Fighter 6 arcade station that we had set up for the guests, etc.) It was during the outdoor photo session with the wedding party and close family, however, that Russ’s vision and experience in the Sonoma/Bay Area really shined. Russ knew our wedding venue like the back of his hand, and he took us to many different locations at the venue. As a result, we now have a diverse combination of natural, artwork, and vineyard photos to treasure forever. He captured so many different styles – we have glam, we have silly, we have traditional, and more! The grooms party in particular has a flair for the dramatic, and Russ made our dream of looking like GQ models a reality. Russ was great in giving us very helpful directions for posing and—looking back at the photos—we love his visualization and composition! Finally, he KNOWS his golden hours so we have absolutely gorgeous sunset photos. He knew exactly when and where to take us to capture the beauty of our venue. In sum, we highly, highly, highly recommend Russ Levi as your wedding photographer.

's portfolio and editing style really stood out. She does a great job of editing true color photos with a bit of enhancement. Her editing is also very consistently good when looking at her full albums. She is also incredibly friendly and fun to work with! She was enthusiastic about discussing planning and photo ideas. We put together a Pinterest board with some inspiration for our venue which she loved. Alex really hustled our whole wedding to make sure she captured everything. She has an amazing eye for framing beautiful photos and is great at giving posing direction for individual and group shots. We enjoyed shooting with her and her suggestions were helpful for making sure we captured great pictures. She managed to make our wedding photos, including the posed photos, feel effortless and fun so we were able to focus on enjoying our wedding! We would definitely recommend her as a wedding photographer. Her portfolio speaks for itself, but she is also the full package of friendly and professional :)

iendly in the months leading up to the wedding, and even scheduled a phone call a week ahead of time to discuss our vision for the photos, make suggestions and provide valuable advice on how to efficiently organize all of our family and friends to get the photos we wanted without taking too much time away from the celebration. Russ joined us for our rehearsal dinner and immediately brought great energy and positivity. Our guests were so excited to have a professional there to capture the evening, and he made sure to capture the smaller details and decorations in addition to our lovely guests, both candid and staged. On our wedding day, Russ showed up early and immediately got to work photographing the details and scenery. Him and Amy helped us to knock out all of our bridesmaid and groomsmen photos ahead of the ceremony so that our wedding party could enjoy the cocktail hour, and expertly directed us where to stand to catch the perfect light and how to move our bodies to get great, natural looking shots. They also took some priceless photos of everyone getting ready for the big day. Russ did a fantastic mix of stunning portraits of the bride and groom, fun/silly photos on the dance floor, candid moments, family photos, and images of all of the decorations and details that we will want to remember most. He also checked in to make sure that he was getting all of the pictures that we wanted, which we really appreciated, and gave great suggestions for silly/cute things to do as well. We received a sneak peek of over 200 of our photos within days of the event. We were totally stunned by the quality, creativity, and diversity of the photos. We could not have asked for a better experience and are so happy to have chosen Russ!

ed portfolio. We set up a video call to meet and get to know each other prior to our engagement photoshoot. He is so easy to talk to! Throughout all of the planning for both our engagement photoshoot and wedding day, he has been upfront, a detailed and organized communicator, kind, understanding, and reliable. In person, he has a comforting presence and a great sense of humor. He delivered all photos within the expected time frame. It has been an absolute pleasure working with Russ and getting to know him! I would highly recommend working him for any special occasion. He is excellent at capturing the moments that "say 1000 words."

responsive to all of our questions and concerns regarding logistics, timing, and specific shots leading up to the wedding. The weather on wedding day was windy, cold, rainy, and generally unpleasant, but Russ was encouraging of us taking pictures outside with the beautiful backdrop of redwoods regardless. He even had an umbrella hat on to protect his cameras from the elements! All the pictures from the event candidly captured the joy, love, and excitement of the day. Russ was absolutely professional, organized, flexible, and directive while also being warm and personable throughout the experience. We would recommend Russ in a heartbeat to anyone looking for an outstanding photographer for their wedding or other upcoming event. Thank you Russ!

Booking Russ for our August 2022 wedding was probably the best choice we made in the planning process. Our photos are an absolute treasure. So many wedding guests commented on "how...

hard your photographer was working." He didn't miss a moment. My grandma, who was unable to travel for the wedding, looked at the entire photo cache and remarked, "I was there, I saw the whole wedding." His energy is infectious, the candids he captured during the reception were amazing. He was so easy and accommodating to work with through the entire process (including 3 different engagement session postponements due to weather/COVID) and gently guided us in the direction that would get us the best photos. He got us photos back so unbelievably quickly after our event.

He broke down Nestldown's timeline and explained everything that we could expect leading up to our wedding. He also understood that we weren't used to taking professional photos which is why we decided to use him as our photographer for our engagement photos. The engagement photoshoot was an incredible experience. It was fun, adventurous, and a learning experience for my wife and I. We became very comfortable with Russ and his style. Best of all, the photos turned out amazing! The wedding itself was tightly planned and we were able to take all the photos we wanted. We captured moments with our wedding party, family, friends, and us as a couple. Even the photos of the event came out perfect. My wife and I can't stop going through our wedding photos and reliving the day! I highly recommend hiring Russ as your photographer for any event!

os: he is excellent with people–herding them into groups while they're none the wiser. He allowed everyone to enjoy the event while still capturing the essential group shots. He also has a knack for capturing the spontaneous. He has a rare talent for finding just the right setup at just the right moment, and working with people to frame his shots elegantly, making them appear natural. We were not experienced at having our pictures taken, but his demeanor and instructions helped us feel comfortable, and resulted in photos that made us look like pros. His candid shots captured moments ranging from delightfully silly to deeply poignant. He is responsive via email and phone, and is simply a blast to work with. Book him early; he is in-demand, and deservedly so. Miles & Monica Married in March 2022 in SF

He truly seemed to share in the excitement that we experienced. He also made the shoot so much fun, and knew so much about the locations where we shot (Sonoma State Park and Armstrong Redwood Forest). He also did a nice job hiding before I knew he was there for us (my now-fiancé surprised me for the proposal). He got us the picture drafts back the next day, and then the top 100 edited one within just a few days, and they were incredible. All around a fantastic experience, and I highly recommend Russ!

He was flexible and responsive as we had a venue change at the last minute due to rain. At our wedding he made everyone feel very comfortable, our guests loved him, and he was present enough to assure me that he was capturing every moment of the day, but also very ninja-like so it never felt like he was disrupting the moment. The photos were gorgeous and he really captured beautiful candid & intimate moments from the entire day. We are so thankful to have had his artistic eye and attention to detail to preserve our most precious memories. It is clear Russ brings a great amount of experience, joy, and passion to his work and I would definitely choose him again if I had the chance!

outfit change. Russ was super accommodating as the first outfit was a bit more complicated so took more time to change out of. The experience of the actual shoot was great! We were a bit stiff at the beginning but Russ really helped us get comfortable with some great direction and guidance for different poses, locations and setups. Within just a few minutes into the first location we were already having lots of fun. It's hard to fully know what the shot will be or how it will turn out but Russ clearly knew what he was doing. He was able to capture the beauty of the location and make us look good in it. Russ has been really fast with communication and delivered of our proofs just a few days after the shoot. The process of selecting and editing has been really straightforward. I can't stress how impressed and excited we are with the final pictures we received. We've been showing them to all our family and friends and everyone has been blown away with the quality and composition, continuing to comment on how good the photographs are and how good we look in them! We hired Russ hoping to capture a few good pictures and left with over 100 treasured memories. I would easily recommend Russ to any of my friends and family.

allowed us to reschedule without any fees or increase in pricing. I should mention he also shot our engagement shoot and we loved our pictures. We didn't have the best weather for part of it due to SF weather and he gladly offered to do another location shoot on another day to make up for it. Something he didn't have to offer at all. Back to the wedding day, he was punctual, gave us great tips/cues when we needed it. My husband and I are very stiff photo takers and don't love taking them, so he made us and our wedding party feel very comfortable. With his little cues, the pictures turned out outstanding! We had so many family and friends comment at how great our pictures turned out. He was very professional the whole time, even helped us iron out some timeline issues and gave us great suggestions. We had viewed a ton of photographers prior to choosing Russ and what really caught our eye was his camera angles and natural feel of the photos. He really captures the moment and surroundings in the best way. He even gave us 118 highlight photos 2 days after our wedding! We did not expect that at all but it really kept our wedding high going. He also delivered our full album in 5 weeks. Would highly recommend Russ for your wedding!

ugh, he was actually one of the recommended vendors at our venue (Nestldown) and we did not realize that until we did our first zoom meeting, haha! From the start he was so polite and always had a smile on his face, it felt really warm and genuine. Russ was very sweet and generous with his time the morning of, arriving early to the hotel we were at. At Nestldown, he is very familiar and will guide you to the most beautiful shots. My husband and I are very uncomfortable showing affection in front of the camera but goodness he made it so easy. His humor was very cheeky and my small crowd of guests absolutely loved it, he fit right in. After the wedding he sent us the gallery quickly and we started the selection process, would you believe his pictures are so perfect and did not require any editing (okay, a few pictures because my husband had a sunglasses tan). All in all we just loved working with him, his price was great considering he is a bay area photographer. There are no hidden fees and is very up front so please do not hesitate on asking any questions. Thank you so much Russ, you were such a pleasure to work with.

g family members and Russ was incredibly skillful in maneuvering around them and prioritizing what we requested. He took nothing personally when people got in front of him. He was so patient and just made everyone laugh and feel good about everything happening. I can’t even believe how good our photos looked. I’m not photogenic at all (I have kind of a lazy-eye) and he was able to make every shot beautiful. How he did it, I have no idea. With candid photos I felt his photography was magical. I was so surprised and pleased with so many things he was able to capture. I couldn’t stop smiling and laughing while looking at what he caught with his camera. He is incredibly skilled and I loved everything that he did so I am incredibly grateful that Lisa Stone for suggested him to us. Ive had friends pay 5k for a wedding photographer and their pictures were blah. Russ’ services were very affordable and worth every dollar. We had a beautiful venue and he did not skimp at all, but got to the venue early, knew where all of the most beautiful spots were, and where the best light was. He was good with communication throughout our planning and during our special day. Anything we requested, he happily obliged. I wasn’t sure I would like posed photos but they were INCREDIBLE. We couldn’t be happier.

I was so afraid that we would be awkward in the photos, but Russ put us at ease and got us to pose in ways that really brought out the love in the photos. He helped reduce any anxiety or worries that we had and made it a fun experience. The photos were simply amazing - his photographic style really captures the mood and gives me goosebumps.

He arrived early and covid safe in an N95 mask. He's great at putting you at ease all day. We also love that he mostly uses a photojournalistic/candid style that documents everything but doesn't get in the way of your wedding with lots of distractions and staged photos. He takes colorful and sharp photos that really capture the moment and make you look great and feel like a moviestar.
