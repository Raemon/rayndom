Thanks to recommendations from couples on The Knot

Suisun Valley Inn - Wedding Retreat is a barn and farm wedding venue located at Monroe Ranch & Vineyards in Fairfield, CA, just east of Napa. Owners and founders Gary Bacon and Ying Ni have created an idyllic getaway nestled within the grounds of this historic ranch and vineyard. You can enjoy an entire weekend in this peaceful location in northern California wine country. Facilities and Capacity This 55-acre property has indoor and outdoor options for 50-250 guests. Our new 7500 sq ft Event Barn has been receiving rave reviews since opening in Summer 2025. The Bridal Path from the Inn to the new outdoor ceremony area follows Suisun Creek, crossing over a small Japanese bridge, through the Moon Gate and awaiting guests. The manicured lawn looks out over row after row of Pinot Noir and Petite Sirah grapevines. Lucky guests may spot a beaver or river otter in the Suisun Creek, which meanders through the property. With parking for 100 cars available on-site, your loved ones will be able to get to your festivities with ease. Services Offered When you book Suisun Valley Inn at Monroe Ranch, you can have multiple days of exclusive use of the property for your celebrations. This will give you plenty of time to prepare, rehearse, and celebrate with your loved ones. Wedding events that can be held at the Inn include engagement parties, bridal showers, rehearsal dinners, elopements, ceremonies, and receptions. The friendly staff can advise on outside vendors and provide cleanup for your special day. There are a number of local restaurants and private chefs who can provide cuisine during your stay and numerous local wine tours. The peak wedding season for this venue stretches from March through October, so you and your guests can enjoy yourselves during shining Californian weather. Accommodation The Inn offers eight suites, each furnished and named in a unique manner. Up to 16 guests can be accommodated in this residence and for meals in the large dining area and include wheelchair-accessible options. This building also offers get-ready rooms for your celebrations. History The story of the Monroe Ranch began in 1860 when James Monroe of Massachusetts settled in the Suisun Valley. Rich soil, dependable water supplies, and bright sunshine combined to create a superb location for farming. The great demand for labor resulted in up to 1,000 Chinese agricultural laborers living near the property towards the end of the 19th century. George Washington’s Mount Vernon estate was the inspiration for the construction of an eight-bedroom house in 2004. After Gary and Ying purchased the property, they repurposed the home as an intimate gathering place for guests.

I cannot say enough about the Suisun Valley Inn at Monroe Ranch! We feel so fortunate to have been able to start our life in such a beautiful place! My now husband and I do not hav...

e family living in California so to be able to spend 4 days all in one house directly on the property was truly magical. We were able to all start the mornings together drinking coffee and eating breakfast before the hustle and bustle began in this beautiful inn which made our days that much more special. Gary was an absolute dream to work with. He was always available if needed and made us feel very warm and welcomed. I truly feel like I am pinching myself to have found such a wonderful and beautiful venue. The barn was an absolute dream. The ceremony site is gorgeous and outside so our guests were able to experience a change in scenery from our ceremony site, to cocktail hour, to the reception. All of our guests raved about the property and how stunning it was. The barn doors opened to the view of the rolling hills which was a striking backdrop. We just had the most amazing time and literally feel like all of our dreams and expectations were exceeded tenfold. Thank you again for making this special day more than we could have ever imagined!

aciones, el señor Gary fue muy atento y respetuoso, contestó a todas nuestras dudas. Tal vez nuestro evento fue algo fuera de lo común, a diferencia de los eventos de boda que se organizan aquí, nosotros contratamos el granero para el 25 de Diciembre para celebrar los 15 años de mi hija , sabemos que son días festivos donde la gente está con su familia , más sin embargo recibimos todo su apoyo para que el evento se hiciera realidad en este día tan especial , puedo decirles que fue una experiencia maravillosa, fue en evento de ensueño y de igual manera nos hospedamos en la casa, donde realmente nos sentimos como en nuestro hogar , sinceramente todas las instalaciones estuvieron limpias en todo momento, Gary estuvo al pendiente de si necesitábamos algo y al igual si la empresa que contratamos para la planeación necesitaban apoyo. Quiero animar a todos los papás que deseen hacerle su quinceañera a su hija, que consideren contratar los servicios de Suisun Valley Inn, ya que harán que su hija viva una experiencia única y de ensueño, no se arrepentirán. Sr Gary agradezco todas sus atenciones y muy pronto estaremos trabajando con usted para los 15 años de mi otra hija… Bendiciones

of time to set up without feeling rushed. The venue is both stunning and incredibly versatile. We held the rehearsal dinner outdoors behind the house, the ceremony at the charming gazebo, and the reception in the newly built barn, which was spacious, elegant, and full of character. The three chandeliers cast a warm, graceful glow throughout the barn, transforming it into a ballroom worthy of a grand celebration. Gary was consistently professional, respectful, and highly responsive throughout the entire process. The setting created a wonderful weekend filled with unforgettable memories. If you're looking for an affordable, flexible, and picturesque venue, Suisun Valley Inn is an outstanding choice.

asoned professional but also very warm and kind. He happily provided us with solutions/contacts for vendors when we approached him. We recently celebrated our elopement here. We were lucky to secure our dates. From the initial conversation over email/phone, to checking out the venue over video calls (we had just moved out of state at the time) Gary was accommodating and willingly answered multiple questions. Leading up to the event, all communications were prompt to address specific questions regarding either decorations, vendors or logistics. During the stay itself - we were extremely happy with the amenities and our guests too enjoyed themselves thoroughly. We would highly recommend this venue for a celebration that wants to enjoy a family style stay for a few nights leading up to the main event or just want to enjoy the Inn by itself.

We flew in a chef to prepare our Welcome Dinner Wedding Chicken meal and the Inn's kitchen was spacious and efficient to prepare the meal for our 85 guests!! Gary and his team did an exceptional job setting up the guest tables and buffet tables, placing them exactly where we needed to accommodate everything.

d a big garden (you really can have them all). The venue is so beautiful, magical, and maintained well by Gary. We could have the place for 4 days 3 nights for ourselves so that we could do our wedding preparations before the day, have some games for our bridal parties and families, and even our rehearsal dinner. Moreover, we like that we could bring our own vendors that suit our preferences. One thing that became our main concern was the weather. Our wedding was in late August, and the weather was pretty hot at noon, and it could get windy at night. But other than that, this place is a very secluded area that made our wedding so special and private, and we would recommend to anyone.

a blank venue that you have complete creative control over….a party planners dream! 200 of our closest friends and family came out and had the time of their lives. We met at a fair, so the country setting was an exquisite backdrop for me to execute my theme. Come one, Come all!! Get your palm read, get a fun photo drawn, have a talk with the Cuban cigar roller and while your at it, head over to the churro truck and try the strawberry filled, it’s to die for! I love Suisun Valley Inn, I will forever have memories of my vision being everything I wanted and more! Every ten years I’ll be back to celebrate our forever love. Gary and his team know what they are doing and make sure your stay there is as comfortable as possible. This venture has motivated me in ways I can’t explain. Go Gary Go! I recommend anyone looking for a memorable event to book Monroe Ranch. If you need any ideas for decorating and bringing it to life, I’m definitely That girl. Ciao!

The Suisun Valley Inn was perfect for our wedding as it is on a vineyard which is what we wanted. It was a bit more affordable than going to wine country but we got the same beauty...

and we loved that we got to stay at the venue for a couple nights. It was comfortable and easy to get ready in. Provided a lot of space for all the guest. We also loved that the lights, tables, chairs, table covers and dance floor were provided. I would highly recommend Suisun Valley Inn!

This ranch is beautiful! We had our intimate, traditional, South-Indian wedding at the Suisun Valley Inn in August. The living room was ideal for hosting the smaller rituals. The w...

edding ceremony and reception were hosted outside. The greenery and vineyard are ideal locations for stunning photography. The large lawn is like a blank canvas, and we were able to design the décor and seating as we pleased. We really loved the venue; and so did our guests. Gary is also one of the kindest people that we've met during this wedding planning process. He goes out of his way to help his clients (ex: safeguarding my numerous last minute Amazon deliveries, just days before the wedding). We highly recommend Suisun Valley Inn.

My husband I could not be happier that we chose Suisun Valley Inn for our wedding. It is the perfect wedding venue. The vineyard setting of the inn was gorgeous. Located just over ...

the hills from Napa Valley, Suisun Valley has all of the beauty of Napa Valley, but none of the congestion or commercialism. The inn itself is also beautiful. We loved the colonial structure. The inside spiral staircase, the columned front porch, and the French doors leading to the backyard all made beautiful backdrops for many of the wedding photos. So did the backyard, which was lined with old oak and pine trees for an outdoor, forest-like feel. Both inside and out, the inn is as nice as it looks in the photos on the website. All rooms were clean, comfortable, and well designed, making a great place for the wedding party to stay for the weekend which everyone really enjoyed. There was plenty of yard area to play backyard games during some of the “quieter” times before the wedding. On the day of the wedding, the side yard made a beautiful site for the ceremony, and the backyard, which was shaded and protected for the most part, made a great site for the reception. Throughout our wedding planning and during the wedding itself, the owner of the inn, Gary, could not have been nicer or more supportive. He was very easy to work with -- always promptly answering our questions, giving us tours of the property for planning purposes, and accommodating our various requests. We would rate this venue over 5 stars if we could as we could not recommend this venue more.

had plenty of room for the entire family. The wedding ceremony and reception were both also held at the property; IT WAS THE PERFECT VENUE! The venue is also in close proximity to a ton of wineries for you to visit during your stay. The Inn would also be great for large group getaways of other events. I highly recommend reaching out to Gary at Suisun Valley Inn. This was an experience I will never forget.

oing on during our planning and wedding. He was extremely helpful in the setup and takedown of our event. The house itself was our favorite decision of our wedding; having some family and friends be able to stay there with us leading up to the wedding and the night of made it an experience to remember for a lifetime. Gary even helped us with personalized wine bottles with our names and wedding date printed on them! We might even book again for our 1 year anniversary!

We originally booked a different venue for our wedding and that was a nightmare, then we found Suisun Valley Inn and the rest is history ❤️❤️❤️We had our wedding here Sept 1st and ...

that is in the middle of pandemic plus the wildfires here in California. We were very blessed that amidst of that we were able to pull off a very beautiful wedding here in Suisun Valley. Gary was awesome, allowing us to check in early the day before our wedding. We were able to set up all our DIY decorations. He was very good in exchanging emails and keeping us updated with the county’s current rules and even weeks before the wedding and days before with the wildfire updates. The mansion is huge and able to accomodate our immediate family so they didn’t have to book a different hotel to stay. Very spacious and clean. The backyard is gorgeous, way enough lighting with the market lights that looks great in pictures. They were able to set up chairs and tables with more than enough social distanncing for our guests. The vineyard is huge you can have awesome pictures for your big day, our guests also enjoyed taking pictures of this place. We were very happy with this venue that all of our guests could not believe that we can have this beautiful wedding in the middle of this pandemic. We made sure we have enough sanitizing stations, masks and social distancing for everyone. Would totally recommend this venue if you want a stress, hassle free and memorable wedding. 😁

ound Gary & Ying's beautiful estate. The wedding was on! Our guest enter the wedding through a road lined with magnolia trees and as they turned the corner they were greeted by a butter yellow stately home with a welcoming red door and a circular driveway highlighted with a flag pole and an American flag whipping in the wind. There was lots of parking hidden beyond the house. There are vineyards framing the front of the property and lush trees flanking the rear of the property. We had the ceremony facing the vineyards, the cocktail hour surrounding the gazebo which we had live music (violin & acoustic guitar) with high top tables and shady umbrellas for our guest to place their cocktails while they snacked on delicious bites. The reception was under the stars behind Ying & Gary's up-lit home with market lights giving the space all the ambiance a backyard wedding needs. During this time safety was a prime concern for our guest. Ying & Gary's estate provided lots of space for social distancing, there were sanitation stations set up for the wedding and an attendant that cleaned the restroom every half hour. The tables that Gary provided were 72" which can usually seat 10-12 people per table were reduced down to 4-5 people per table. There was dancing with lots of room for people to get their goove on with a breeze always keeping us from getting to warm while dancing the night away. Gary was available throughout our visit to make sure that everything was in place and to help our vendors with any questions they may have had. The two adjectives I heard over & over about the wedding was "magical" & "fun", what more can you ask for? As much as I loved the wedding, I also loved the days leading up to the wedding. Staying in Ying & Gary's lovely home with my family, making memories I will never forget. We would make family meals in the kitchen which has a 6 burner cooktop, 2 ovens, a large refrigerator and 2 DISHWASHERES! We all sat arround the huge dinner table sharing stories and laughs. At night we would go out back, turn on the market lights, pull out some lawn chairs, play some horse shoe or volleyball or cornhole and of course sip some wine. Cheering the teams on or maybe do a little smack talking. When it was time to retreat to our rooms most of us had our own spacious bedroom with an attached bathroom. So if you wanted some time alone you had your cozy bedroom santuary to read a book or watch tv or whatevery you want to do. If you wanted to hang out with people there is a roomy and comfy great room with a grand fireplace. It had it all!
