DJ Buddy Holly (David) was amazing. We had super easy communication and was totally stress free. He some how knew our music style right away and did not disappoint. He also was by ...

far the most economical, and came in under 1/2 of what other DJ charged at minimum. Great quality music and an overall awesome person. Thank you DJ Buddy Holly for a great night and making our wedding one to remember.

David did an amazing job providing music for our ceremony and reception! Not only was he on point with our requests for special dances, but he was also very receptive to our guests...

' requests, and even located an instrumental version of "At Last" on the spot for a completely impromptu vocal performance by my cousin! He ALSO played acoustic guitar for our ceremony and cocktail hour, and we were very pleased to find that he already knew all of the songs we wanted him to play for the ceremony. We were very happy to have found someone who could cover all of our music needs for our special day.

As any bride-to-be knows, planning a wedding is no easy task. That is why hiring a DJ who is communicative, responsive, and professional is truly worth a million bucks! DJ Buddy Ho...

lly is an excellent DJ, but more than that he is a true professional. He not only patiently worked with me to create music playlists based on my requests, he also went above and beyond my expectations on communicating with me throughout the process leading up to the big day. His involvement truly helped to make my big day extra special. I highly recommend DJ Buddy Holly for your special occasion!!
