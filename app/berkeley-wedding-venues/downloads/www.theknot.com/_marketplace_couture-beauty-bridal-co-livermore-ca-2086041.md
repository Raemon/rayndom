Rachelle was an absolute blessing to work with. To be honest, she’s so amazing I had already decided I wanted her to do my hair & makeup for my wedding before I was even engaged (L...

OL). An amazing perk to using Rachelle is I was able to have her start doing my hair a year before the wedding so it was perfect for the big day. I highly recommend her and her team. She is extremely professional, talented, and trust worthy. Highly recommend a bridal trial. It gave us the perfect opportunity to make tweaks for the big day, and let me tell you I’m so glad we did. Literally never felt more beautiful in my whole life. She did my makeup and hair PERFECT. Her team also did a great job on my girls/mom. She will go above and beyond to make your big day special. Oh AND she is fairly priced. Beyond worth it!

Rachelle and her amazing team did the most anaxing work on the best day of my life. I enjoyed every interaction and the experience of having her for my wedding and hair and makeup ...

needs. From my fun bridal trial to the actual wedding day, she was positive, punctual, and absolutely professional. Rachelle is truly a master at her art and comes with a wealth of knowledge and experience, bringing fresh ideas and creativity to her styling that just works. On the day of my wedding, she and her team showed up early and effortlessly styled and applied makeup to NINE bridesmaids, two moms, and me! All with a smile, patience, and completing everybody in a timely manner. The communication leading up to the event was great, she was available for any last minute changes or questions. Rachelle is so good at what she does, that I now ONLY go to her for all my hair and makeup needs. I refuse to let anybody else touch my face or hair. I HIGHLY recommend Rachelle. You will not regret it!
