Description

She is the modern-day empress exuding elegance, style and grace – she is Ciara. Her contemporary and luxurious design celebrates the feminine form rouching in all the right places. Ciara’s courageous in style, and luxurious to look at with her famous stretch georgette. Her fashion forward Asymmetrical neckline and one shoulder bodice makes Ciara classic and flattering. What’s special about Ciara is her ability to be minimalistic, in the way she can be chic or accessorized for personality. Her exposed bodice with boning and rouching shapes her curves providing flattery on every angle before dipping into a wonderful 70 inch train. Ciara’s a showstopper and shouldn’t be underestimated by her simplicity for she is chic – she is Ciara.
