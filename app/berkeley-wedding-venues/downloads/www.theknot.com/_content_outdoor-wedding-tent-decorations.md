## Simple Wedding Tent Decorations

Aiming for a [simple and chic wedding vibe](https://www.theknot.com/content/minimalist-wedding-decor)? These simple wedding tent decorations are stylish but not over the top, which is perfect for an [outdoor wedding](https://www.theknot.com/content/outdoor-wedding-planning-guide) with a chill vibe. 

### 1\. Rattan Lamp Shades

![Rattan lamp shades in an event tent](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/337003c5-c849-482d-a1b4-6362d48ed15d~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1000.1333)

_[Photo: Ruét Photo](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/ruet-photo-georgetown-tx-768995)_

If you're leaning toward decor that's more simplified, crystal chandeliers might not be the best fit for your wedding day. Instead, go for something a bit more relaxed, like natural rattan light fixtures. Their texture will add a casual, earthy feel to the interior of your wedding tent.

### 2\. White Sailcloth Tent

![Outdoor white event tent reception](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/c8c9853b-1f83-4e8d-9dd8-db9f24a21dc2~rs_768.h-cr_0.180.1080.1620)

_[Photo: Amy Rizzuto Photography](https://www.theknot.com/real-weddings/wedding-guests-gathered-underneath-a-sailcloth-tent-photo-1)_

Sailcloth tents are most commonly associated with [coastal and nautical wedding styles](https://www.theknot.com/content/nautical-wedding-ideas), but they're so stylish on their own that you hardly need any additional decorations—unless you want them. 

### 3\. Open-Top Canopy Wedding Tent Decorations

![Open-air canopy tent](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/ba754850-287f-4a1c-923f-bb2b0c09c018~rs_768.h-cr_320.0.5440.3840)

_[Photo: Joseph Lin Photography](https://www.theknot.com/real-weddings/draped-beach-reception-with-string-lights-photo)_

For venues with abundant natural scenery, you won't want to take away from the surrounding views with elaborate wedding tent decorations. Instead, opt for something simple and minimalistic, like an open-top bamboo canopy with fabric drapes to blow in the breeze. 

### 4\. Garland Wedding Tent Pole Decoration

![Garland wedding pole decoration](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/7a1cc62d-4ddb-4dc2-918d-4b0ec97de3d5~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1000.1333)

_[Photo: Lauren Galloway Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/lauren-galloway-photography-tampa-fl-828704)_

A few garlands of ivy or greenery will quickly hide unsightly tent poles. Instead of worrying about obtrusive structural details throwing off the vibe, incorporate them as part of your decor with simple garlands. 

### 5\. Use the Tent as Decor

![Tented Ceremony Setup at Martha's Vineyard](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/4ae43ded-82e1-43c4-9842-de8393300950~rs_768.h-cr_0.160.1458.2104)

_[Photo: Ruth Eileen Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/ruth-eileen-photography-framingham-ma-397301)_

To keep it as simple as possible, choose a tent that suits your style to the point where you won't even need to add much to it—like this gorgeous setup above. 

### 5\. Bundles of Wildflowers

![Bundles of wildflowers in tent](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/4d35f58b-c88d-4e13-b016-d9166763a5a1~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1440.1080)

_[Photo: Kaity Brawley](https://kaitybrawley.com/)_

The whole concept behind this simple [wedding tent](https://www.theknot.com/content/all-about-tents) decoration idea is that it doesn't need to be too perfect—the more whimsical, the better. Mix and match colorful wildflowers and decorate the ceiling of the tent with an assortment of single stems and handmade flower garlands.

### 6\. Paper Lanterns

![Paper lanterns in event space](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/be2ea17c-f54f-4e18-bfc6-62494a65eace~rs_768.h-cr_2.0.1078.1434)

_[Photo: Leila Brewster Photography](https://www.theknot.com/real-weddings/elegant-reception-tent-with-lanterns-photo)_

Who knew paper lanterns could be so chic? The trick for this simple wedding tent decoration is to keep the lanterns all one color, like a neutral white, to avoid veering into birthday party territory. 

### 7\. Black and White Tent Wedding Decorations

![Black and white tent decor](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/3b44d12b-d3a2-49ae-9746-74efd9863de7~rs_768.h-cr_139.0.2362.1667)

_[Photo: Robin Jolin Photography](https://www.theknot.com/real-weddings/elegant-clear-tent-reception-photo)_

Thanks to the bold color-blocking technique, this contrasting black and white tent looks more elaborate than it really is. While you can complete the look by adding chandeliers or other light fixtures, it would look just as interesting without them. 

## Backyard Wedding Tent Decorations

A [backyard wedding reception](https://www.theknot.com/content/home-wedding-reception-secrets) is one of the most common reasons to rent a tent. Check out these elegant backyard tent wedding ideas and simple ideas you can pull off without too much hassle. 

### 8\. Wooden Pergolas

![Wooden pergola outdoor furniture](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/728f81c6-38e1-4f44-a743-0165c42af80f~rs_768.h-cr_5.0.2630.3500)

_[Photo: Ashley Goodwin Photography](https://www.theknot.com/real-weddings/canopied-lounge-furniture-photo)_

Sometimes a large reception tent isn't doable for your backyard venue, and that's okay. Work with a rental company or [wedding decorator](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-decorators) to source wooden pergolas for a similar look on a smaller scale. 

### Find your kind of venue

From barns to ballrooms, discover reception venues that feel like you.

### 9\. Tented Twinkle Light Strands

![Hanging twinkling lights](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/803c3b01-17b2-4e4c-aa5d-c236e5703e5e~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1000.1333)

_[Photo: Austin Gros](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/austin-gros-nashville-tn-356251)_

Who says you need canvas or fabric to create a wedding tent? This Instagram-worthy idea might not provide any coverage from the elements, so you might want to prepare a [wedding backup plan](https://www.theknot.com/content/outdoor-wedding-backup-plan), but its beauty makes it worth the risk. Work with your wedding vendors to create a canopy of string lights that stretch above the tables and the dance floor for an unforgettable evening under the stars—we mean lights.

### 10\. Greenery-Adorned Wedding Tent Entrance Decor

![Greenery tent entrance](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/a49b118d-b6a3-4f81-a9ed-9a2f5ae6894c~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1000.1333)

_[Photo: Austin Trenholm Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/austin-trenholm-photography-fort-myers-fl-768399)_

Customized landscaping is out of the question at most wedding venues, but if you're getting married in your own backyard, that brings a new set of possibilities. Map out the tent's location based on where you can add plants or bushes to create a greenery marquee entrance. 

### 11\. Greenery and String Lights

![Wedding Reception Tent Decorated With Greenery](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/30434ee5-6cad-4002-97e0-0d39957768dd~rs_768.h-cr_0.71.1458.2015)

_[Photo: Banga Studios](https://www.bangastudios.ca/)_

String lights intertwined with greenery create the dreamiest canopy effect inside a wedding tent. When the sun sets, the soft glow filters through the leaves and vines, adding warmth, depth and a little sparkle to the space.

### 12\. Poolside Tent

![Poolside tent for events](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/38f9b56e-6fa6-4210-bc22-a6d559409586~rs_768.h-cr_111.0.1890.1334)

_[Photo: Hyer Images](https://www.theknot.com/real-weddings/clear-tented-reception-at-william-aiken-house-photo)_

Getting married in a yard with a pool or pond? Incorporate it as part of your event space by putting your wedding tent close by. Wrap the tent poles in white fabric or covers to clearly mark the boundaries of the tent for safety purposes. 

### 13\. Illuminated Clear-Top Tent Wedding Decor

![Illuminated tent ceiling](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/fa47789e-8572-41be-b240-461cae053caf~rs_768.h-cr_0.113.1331.1888)

_[Photo: Jennings King Photography](https://www.theknot.com/real-weddings/a-tented-reception-with-string-lights-photo)_

Don't just think about how your wedding tent decorations will look from inside the tent. This stunning clear-top tent is equally as impressive when viewed from a distance, thanks to the string lights decorating the ceiling. 

### 14\. Simple Round Tent

![Round event tent](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/0dd63189-b366-4a30-bcc1-aa22c81c0c27~rs_768.h-cr_167.0.2834.2000)

_[Photo: Lindsey Cole Photography](https://www.theknot.com/real-weddings/wedding-reception-underneath-sailcloth-tent-photo-1)_

For small backyard weddings, a simple round sailcloth tent creates a cozy environment that's just the right size for your group. Basic candles or string lights will add charm as the sun goes down. 

### 15\. Light Projections

![Light projection for tents](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/6e6fd7ff-3e3f-475e-9087-b3dfe7309f07~rs_768.h-cr_276.0.4699.3317)

_[Photo: VUE Photography](https://www.theknot.com/real-weddings/backyard-reception-with-light-up-balloons-in-pool-photo)_

If you don't want to resort to elaborate backyard wedding tent decorations, use colorful lights and projections to your advantage instead. Gobos, pin spot lighting and LED light features will quickly transform an outdoor space after dark.

Dried flower accents are still a favorite for rustic weddings, and you can get creative with how you incorporate them. For this rustic wedding tent decoration idea, clusters of dried baby's breath, smokebush branches and curly willow were suspended from the ceiling to look like clouds.

_[Photo: Megan Wynn Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/megan-wynn-photography-vail-co-888849)_

A wooden arch adorned with lush greenery at the front of your wedding tent instantly becomes a natural focal point. The wood tones and organic vines give the space an earthy, grounded feel, while still looking refined and intentional. You can keep it simple with greenery or brighten up it with florals. 

### 18\. Antique Kilim Rugs

![Kilim rugs for event space](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/2e2fec42-6b82-408e-a779-63df8ab2de0e~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1000.1333)

Start decorating your wedding tent from the ground up—literally. Layered vintage rugs will give your space a [boho rustic look](https://www.theknot.com/content/bohemian-wedding-ideas). Additional earthy accents like macramé lighting, dried floral bouquets and clusters of thick branches will accentuate the theme.

_[Photo: Corinna Raznikov Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/corinna-raznikov-photography-marion-ma-324220)_

If you have a high tent canopy, max out the vertical space with an _actual_ tree as a focal centerpiece. Cover the branches in delicate string lights for a decorative detail that will be the conversation piece of the evening.

### 20\. Woven Chandeliers

![Tented Wedding Reception With Woven Chandeliers](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/af3be318-185d-493c-aa21-871e4a080e10~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1458.1944)

_[Photo: Kir2Ben](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/kir2ben-alexandria-va-969431)_

Woven chandeliers are great for giving a wedding tent a warm, rustic glow. Go for rattan or wicker pendants suspended at different heights, casting soft, dappled light over the tables and dance floor. They'll add texture and an organic feel, especially when paired with greenery, neutral linens or earthy florals.

### 21\. Iron Chandeliers

![Iron chandelier for tent](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/da26b192-2b00-47ef-9f99-5f53f71e07c6~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1000.1333)

_[Photo: Ashley Sawtelle](https://www.theknot.com/real-weddings/tent-with-wicker-chandeliers-and-foliage-on-tent-poles-photo-1)_

Autumn is an ideal time to incorporate seasonal foliage like colorful orange and red tree branches. Recreate this fall wedding tent decoration idea by wrapping them around the tent poles to camouflage the more functional elements of your reception tent.

### 23\. Hanging Flowers

![a flower covered ceremony tent](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/aa5d6376-4cb3-4be7-a087-f8bdcb6bf327~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1080.1440)

_[Photo: Molly Lichten Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/molly-lichten-photography-pasadena-ca-818836)_

Hanging florals can be rustic or formal, depending on the varieties you choose. You can keep things casual by simply suspending them from the tent ceiling. Scatter them at different heights so it feels natural and effortless, as if the flowers were gathered from a nearby field that morning.

### 24\. Faux Tree Tent Poles

![Faux tree tent poles](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/af18bb89-795b-4afd-ae02-fd8fb79fd27e~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1000.1333)

Hello, [cottagecore wedding](https://www.theknot.com/content/cottagecore-wedding-inspiration) of our dreams. This unique wedding tent decoration idea is something your guests will always remember, and it's a perfect compromise for rustic woodland style if you can't actually get married in the woods. 

### 25\. Potted Seasonal Plants and Flowers

![Potted seasonal plants](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/f60f0bed-3cd4-4e62-bb92-4b99cb4514ed~rs_768.h-cr_320.0.5440.3840)

_[Photo: Christa Kimble Photography](https://www.theknot.com/real-weddings/white-tented-reception-private-residence-backyard-photo)_

Walled tents are great for providing warmth in chilly temperatures, but from the outside, their blank white exterior can look a little lackluster. Decorate the entrance with potted trees, plants and oversized flower arrangements for more flair. 

### 26\. Rope Swings

![Indoor rope swings](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/24159bb6-98c3-4397-998b-27ea448ec983~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1000.1333)

_[Photo: Gideon Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/gideon-photography-st-george-ut-398083)_

Your inner child (and everyone else's) will love this fun wedding tent decoration idea. A set of rope swings is a photogenic idea that will have your entire guest list lining up to take turns—just make sure the tent structure is strong enough to support the weight. 

## Classic Wedding Tent Decorations

With the right styling, wedding tents can look as formal and beautiful as a traditional ballroom (and we've got photos to prove it). Here are just a few [classic wedding](https://www.theknot.com/content/classic-wedding-ideas) tent decoration ideas we love.

### 27\. Hanging Flower Garden

![Hanging spring foliage](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/01149f9f-988d-414e-b6a8-0f1995816620~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1000.1333)

_[Photo: Larissa Cleveland Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/larissa-cleveland-photography-san-francisco-ca-614905)_

It's no secret that wedding flowers have the ability to transform the look of any wedding venue, including a tent. While eye-level details are important, give some love to the highest points of your tent with gorgeous [hanging centerpieces](https://www.theknot.com/content/hanging-reception-ceremony-flowers).

### 28\. Dramatic Curtains

![Black Reception Table With Taper Candles, Low Centerpieces With Red Details Under Clear Tent](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/f9c5befb-b8f6-4a5f-91ed-dad08f010736~rs_768.h)

_[Photo: Niki Marie Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/niki-marie-photography-detroit-mi-582695)_

Add a bit of drama to your wedding tent by adding dark curtains. Deep hues like charcoal, navy or even black will elevate the space to create a moody atmosphere, especially if you pair them with candlelight or soft uplighting.

### 29\. Romantic Twinkle Lights

![Romantic twinkle lights at night](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/a6aef28c-848c-4c92-acc9-73200c0fbe56~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1000.1333)

_[Photo: Alison Conklin Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/alison-conklin-photography-philadelphia-pa-230223)_

String lights are such a necessity for an outdoor wedding, especially because they're relatively affordable and easy to source. We love how these tiny bulbs pop against the [clear-top tent](https://www.theknot.com/content/clear-tent-wedding-rental) for a contemporary yet classic effect.

### 30\. Draped Fabric Ceiling

![Draped fabric ceiling for tent](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/ff4d3217-08f6-4a43-ab33-3d3438ede2b3~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1000.1333)

_[Photo: Lori Hedrick Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/lori-hedrick-photography-roanoke-va-395507)_

Arguably the most classic version of wedding tent ceiling decor, this design is nothing if not timeless. Drape chiffon, silk or organza across the top of your wedding tent for a luxurious feel. Overlay the fabric with strands of lights to make the impact even more dramatic.

### 31\. Striking Chandeliers with Greenery

![Striking Chandeliers with Greenery](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/7cfc245e-c9e6-4616-96cb-84b59e9cb337~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1080.1440)

_[Photo: Brandon Kidd](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/brandon-kidd-photography-yorba-linda-ca-477873)_

Striking chandeliers wrapped in greenery are an amazing way to add texture to a romantic tent design. Hung above tables or the dance floor, they draw the eye upward and create visual drama without feeling overdone.

### 32\. Monogrammed Accents

![Monogrammed tent accents](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/9bb12c25-26fb-4ad4-a728-020b3940d2c0~rs_768.h-cr_0.63.2137.2912)

_[Photo: Bonnie Sen Photography](https://www.theknot.com/real-weddings/tent-for-backyard-wedding-in-st-louis-missouri-photo)_

We're in favor of adding even the tiniest details to personalize your wedding tent decor, like this monogrammed canopy. 

### 33\. Structured Open-Air Tent

Worried about heat getting trapped under your reception canopy on a hot summer night? Consider an open-air tent above the dance floor or cocktail bar. Add texture to the top by intertwining the bars with garlands and flowers for a greenhouse-inspired vibe. 

### 34\. Sparkling Chandeliers

Take inspiration from indoor-outdoor home design by decorating your reception tent with traditional glass chandeliers. It's like combining a garden with a formal ballroom for the best of both worlds.

### 35\. Partially-Draped Wedding Tent

Can't decide between a clear-top tent or a fabric tent? This option lets you have both. Use smaller strips of fabric to accent the transparent ceiling backdrop without totally obstructing the view.
