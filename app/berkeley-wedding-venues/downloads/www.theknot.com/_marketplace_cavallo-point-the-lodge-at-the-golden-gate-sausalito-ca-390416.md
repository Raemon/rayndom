The Cavallo Point event coordinator we worked with was unprofessional and lacked attention to detail. From the get-go, our contract was riddled with errors even after I asked for t...

hem to be corrected. Confirming details with the coordinator after our tasting was difficult and confusing. For example, we confirmed in person and via email that we wanted the bar open an hour earlier. The night-of, the bar wasn't open, I brought it up to the Cavallo event coordinator, and they started arguing with me. Their policies around when you need to be cleared out of the bridal getting-ready area, and when they will tell you your room number (for your "complimentary" overnight stay) are inconvenient and not client-oriented. Finally, we left a few items in the bridal getting ready room, called Cavallo to report it the next day, and they did nothing about it - none of the items were recovered. Overall a pretty sour experience. From our guests' perspective, the food was delicious and it is a beautiful location. From a planning perspective, it was extremely disappointing - I would not recommend booking this venue unless you also hire a full-service planner who will manage 100% of the interactions with this vendor.

The only good thing Cavallo Point has going for it is its physical location. Everything else that they touched they completely botched. I tried so hard not to let their mistakes br...

ing down the happiness of the weekend, but it was really hard. I would strongly advise couples against using this vendor. They truly did their best to ruin the weekend. Some highlights of what went wrong: 1) loading a guests' baggage onto an airport shuttle even though he was driving his own car elsewhere (it was discovered after the shuttle had already left) 2) charging all of my extended family's rooms ($10,000) to my husbands' parents' credit card and suggesting that we reconcile it amongst ourselves instead of reversing and recharging the charge 3) Giving us different rooms from the ones we had agreed upon in our written contract

The view from your reception will wow your guests. It is an eco-friendly venue just north of the golden gate bridge. You can see the bridge from your reception hall, there is an am...

azing restaurant on-site. Your guests can hike or go to the city as part of the celebration weekend. We loved that it is a tuck-away spa by the water just far enough away from the hustle and bustle of San Francisco. A good compromise for the couple who like both the city and the outdoors, the old and the new. Staff are very nice and efficient, the venue is beautiful, classy but not stuffy, and costs are reasonable. The only things they forgot were that we had beer on the menu, and didn't cut the top tier to serve when guests ran out of cake. Otherwise nothing but praise for how they helped us create a great reception and many special memories. Our guests raved about the food, I had 5 bites and they were good! Organic, seasonal food that were substantial, fresh, and delicious, no rubber chicken here. We chose it over many other venues we checked and we are very happy we did. We couldn't have picked a better venue. Highly recommended!
