Whether you're considering going natural or getting a sew-in, finding the best wedding hairstyles for Black women can feel overwhelming since there's an abundance of options out there. In addition, many people believe hair is a representation of your identity in the Black community, but don't let this add pressure to your decision. [Brandy Allen](https://www.bridalglamla.com/), celebrity hair and makeup artist, explains how Blackness doesn't have to be a monolith. "There's no single definition of 'bridal hair.' You can walk down the aisle in coils, braids, press-outs or wigs and still be stunning. The beauty is in the freedom to choose and celebrate our versatility because Black [wedding hairstyles](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-hairstyles-you-will-love) are constantly evolving," she says.

Another element of finding the right wedding look is booking a hairstylist that's experienced with working with your hair type. [Kay Jones and Rossy Medrano](https://www.instagram.com/theitbrides/), owners of hair and makeup collective [The IT Brides](https://www.theitbrides.com/), agree. "It's important to work with a team who understands your vision, values your hair and makes you feel truly heard and understood," says Jones and Medrano.

## Top Trending Wedding Hairstyles for Black Women

As a Black woman who's always planning her next hairstyle, I know that keeping up-to-date on the latest [trending wedding hairstyles](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-hair-trends) is a must for any Black to-be-wed, bridesmaid or guest. Below you'll find a combination of styles I've seen real brides wear and ones Allen, Jones and Medrano have done on their clients to inspire your look.

### 1\. Flat Twists With Roses and Baby's Breath




![Flat twists Black wedding hairstyle with baby's breath ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/65553b56-6dc8-4313-9552-9bbcbab5a092~rs_768.h-cr_0.17.1080.1457)

Add some whimsy to your [natural wedding hairstyle](https://www.theknot.com/content/natural-wedding-hairstyles) by adding some of your favorite flowers to your hair. I love how this bride decided to do flat twists in the back and a picked-out afro in the front. And for those who think natural hair isn't "elegant" enough for a wedding, think again. "That line of thought is outdated and rooted in Eurocentric beauty standards. Natural hair is inherently elegant. From structured afros to twist-outs, natural styles offer beauty, volume and versatility. A wedding can and should reflect the bride's truth, not always trends," Allen says. 

### 2\. Sleek Low Bun With Silver Hair Accessories




![Sleek low bun Black wedding hairstyle with silver accessories](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/96c17dd3-6bfd-4ff8-96fe-d3d580425d17~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.2283.2283)

If you don't want to deal with hair in your face while you kiss your future spouse or dance with your friends, [wedding updos](https://www.theknot.com/content/updos-for-long-hair) are the perfect options for you. Adorned with a silver pearl and crystal hair accessory, this sleek bun pulls the hair out of way while looking formal and fashionable.

### 3\. Long Hair With Large Curls




![Long hair with big curls Black wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/2a404dab-3afb-419d-ae55-3815247aabf1~rs_768.h-cr_0.55.1290.1775)

_[Photo courtesy of Brandy Allen](https://www.bridalglamla.com/)_

Look like a _Love Island_ bombshell with breathtaking voluminous curls. Even as the curls start to fall, you'll still have a soft and glamorous hairstyle by the end of the night. (And for those who want their hairstyle to last as long as possible, remember to pin your curls before you go to bed.)

### 4\. Curly Locs in a Top Bun




![Curly locs in top bun Black wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/518655f9-e8a6-4e5f-a455-5849fed032f1~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1449.1932)

Need elegant wedding hairstyles for natural Black hair? Then, steal this idea from this bride who was inspired by _Princess and the Frog_ for her wedding. My favorite part is how the crown sits perfectly among the bride's bright red curled locs. 

### 5\. Side-Swept Braid With Gold Hair Accessories 




![Side-swept braid with gold hair accessories Black wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/689b1991-73d7-420a-b571-6aeec8aede42~rs_768.h-cr_0.48.1449.1980)

Yes, I know this roundup is for women, but I had to include this little attendant's graceful hairdo. One of my favorite [Black braided hairstyles](https://www.theknot.com/content/black-braided-hairstyles), any adult can take this idea and add real flowers to the braid to pull off a romantic look. 

### Find your kind of venue

From barns to ballrooms, discover reception venues that feel like you.

### 6\. Fade Haircut




![Fade haircut Black wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/9c90dbba-093c-4b3f-ae46-9be4c54a82ec~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.768.1024)

_[Photo Courtesy of The IT Brides](https://www.theitbrides.com/)_

I know that [wedding hairstyles for short hair](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-hairstyles-short-hair) are hard to come by so it was crucial I added at least one to this trending Black wedding hairstyles list. You can go the classic route with this look (like the bride above) or ask your hairstylist to add an intricate design to your fade. 

### 7\. Afro With Crystal Hair Accessory




![Afro with crystal accessory Black wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/4d627f70-7a2f-47d4-bd16-42f9284e33bb~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1449.1932)

Want bold wedding hairdos for Black brides? Consider doing a large afro with a statement hair barrette to match for the celebration. I think this look would do great with [bridal hair accessories](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-hair-accessories) like gems or pearls tucked into the hair. 

### 8\. Locs in a Large Bun




![Locs in a large bun Black wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/5a43c376-d3f8-4234-ad84-d75be64cc67f~rs_768.h-cr_0.90.1080.1530)

Perfect for a spring or summer wedding, I love how this Black bride's hair is in a bun that looks like a beautiful flower in bloom. Purposeful or not, the locs also resemble the black winding knot details on the bride's tux. 

### 9\. Long Hair With Loose Curls




![Long hair with loose curls Black wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/1ffb1270-3568-4d6d-8788-240b0ef780ae~rs_768.h-cr_0.19.1449.1951)

_[Photo Courtesy of The IT Brides](https://www.theitbrides.com/)_

A mix between retro waves or pin curls, this look is one of the many great bridal hairstyles for Black brides, bridesmaids and guests because of the effortless elegance it exudes. This is the ideal hairdo for anyone looking for something simple, yet stylish.

### 10\. Afro With Braided Side Part and Jumbo Barrette




![Afro with braided side part and jumbo barrette Black wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/c3fb82c0-84a2-4173-a45e-1a83ba34daf0~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1449.1932)

When you're looking for wedding hairstyles for African American women, always choose something that works best with the climate. (The experts will talk more about this below.) At this temperate San Diego wedding, the bride had her natural afro out and didn't have to worry about humidity ruining the style. 

### 11\. Large Afro Ponytail 




![Large Afro ponytail Black wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/926cc04b-2d43-497c-a417-49e98e8730ec~rs_768.h-cr_0.48.1449.1980)

I think this hairstyle is perfect for retro-themed weddings. This Diana Ross-esque [wedding ponytail](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-ponytail-hairstyles) serves the perfect amount of volume for those who want to stand out. Also, consider adding hair glitter so your hair sparkles under the reception lights on the dance floor.

### 12\. Pineapple Hairstyle




![Pineapple wedding hairstyle for Black bride](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/6cb0871d-05d8-40f6-9469-9cd73aaf11ed~rs_768.h-cr_0.89.1080.1529)

If you're in search of [curly wedding hairstyles](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-hairstyles-for-curly-hair) that don't involve your hair obstructing your (beautiful) face, this option is your best bet. The pineapple hairstyle isn't a new trend, but I see this as a great way for to-be-weds and guests to look fashionable while being practical at the same time.

This is just one of the many ways you can style your [wedding hair with a veil](https://www.theknot.com/content/long-hairstyles-with-veils). The look is bold without being overwhelming and is perfectly accented with the large silver headband. And who doesn't love glamorous Hollywood curls for a wedding?

## How to Choose Black Wedding Hairstyles, According to Experts

[Choosing a wedding hairstyle](https://www.theknot.com/content/choosing-a-wedding-day-hairstyle) takes a village, that's why I asked wedding beauty experts for their top tips for the process. No matter your [hair length](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-hair-type-tips), Allen, Jones and Medrano breakdown everything you need to know. 

### See What Hairstyles Are Trending

Staying on top of the latest in wedding hair is necessary if you don't want your look to seem outdated. I've already included the top 15 trending hairstyles among Black women above, but the experts say there are few more that you should add to the list. "The top three trending wedding hairstyles that we're seeing everywhere for Black to-be-weds and bridesmaids are natural hair with embellishments, sleek and chic updos and intricately braided styles," says Jones and Medrano. They explain why their clients are choosing these styles by adding, "So many women are embracing their natural curls and coils, and we love it. Sleek updos are great for highlighting facial features and beautifully complementing detailed wedding dresses. And braided styles are a stunning way to represent the culture and add a unique touch to your overall look." Allen says, "Hollywood waves with body and layers" is another popular option with modern brides.

Want to know what their favorite wedding hairstyles are? Jones and Medrano say their top pick is the "French roll with soft, face-framing tendrils. It's a timeless and elegant style that complements just about every bride." Allen likes "a natural-textured updo or half-up, half-down style that shows off the bride's natural coils or kinks in a sculpted, but soft, regal way. It celebrates her texture while still feeling elegant and timeless."

### Ask Your Wedding Hairstylist for Their Expertise

Take the pressure off of yourself by having a conversation with your hairstylist during the consultation and the hair trial. Jones and Medrano ask their clients about their vision for their wedding day, their hair history, natural texture, comfort with different styles and much more to figure out what hairstyle works best for them. "We provide clients with the pros and cons of each option—whether that's rocking your natural hair, getting a perm, wearing a wig or weave or choosing a protective style—based on your desired look and lifestyle," they explain. Allen asks similar questions, and in addition, "What the client can realistically maintain leading up to the day. From there, I talk through options like natural, silk press, unit installs or protective styles, and consider the weather, location and schedule. I always remind them this is their moment to feel most like themselves, just enhanced." 

Before you can ask a [wedding hairstylist](https://www.theknot.com/content/questions-to-ask-your-hairstylist) for their opinion, you need to book one you trust is experienced in creating gorgeous Black wedding hairstyles for your hair type. Head over to [The Knot Vendor Marketplace](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/beauty-services) and click the "Beauty services" filter to narrow down your vendor focus to hairstylists. Next, use the "Support diversity" filter to select Black-owned businesses so you can pick the perfect vendor for you. 

### Think About the Logistics for Your Potential Hairstyle

**"** For most brides, we typically spend between two and two and a half hours on their hair on the wedding day. If you're getting a protective style like a wig or weave, we recommend having it installed by our team a day or two before the wedding. That way, you won't have to spend the entire getting-ready time in our chair," says Jones and Medrano. Allen breaks down the estimated timelines for specific hairstyles so you can keep this in consideration before you make your final decision. "Units, braids or extended installs should be done no less than two to three days before the wedding to allow time for adjustment. Natural styles or silk presses should be done either the day before the wedding or early on the wedding day to ensure freshness. Curls should always be done the day of even if it's curled and pinned the day before," she says. 

Keeping all of this in mind, this is why beauty experts say hair trials are essential whether you're doing a [formal hairstyle](https://www.theknot.com/content/formal-hairstyles) or casual look because it allows them to see not only how beautiful the hairdo will be, but also how it holds up throughout the day. 

### Consider the Humidity

Don't let humidity ruin a good hair day. Instead, pick a hairstyle that works with the weather. "For humid weather, protective styles are key. Think updos, half up half down, sleek buns, wigs and sleek ponytails. These styles resist frizz and hold shape despite moisture in the air," explains Allen. Speaking of humidity, here are some expert approved tips for those who want to be natural on the wedding day in a humid climate: 

  * "Find a hairstylist who specializes in natural hair. Someone with experience and expertise will give your hair the TLC it truly deserves," says Jones and Medrano.
  * "Hydration is key in the weeks leading up to the wedding—deep conditioning regularly," Allen says. 
  * "Invest in high quality products specifically designed for natural hair," suggests Jones and Medrano.
  * "Choose styles that highlight your curl pattern like defined twist-outs, braid-outs or sculpted puffs," Allen says.
