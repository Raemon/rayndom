To say we were satisfied and happy with hiring this videographer would be a massive understatement. We were overjoyed at what Kyle brought to the table. Kyle Mize Productions made ...

our wedding! From the pre-planning stages to the day of our wedding he was attentive, very friendly, extremely professional and the end product showed his incredible talent and experience with his field. We struggled with some wind on our wedding day, but Kyle assured us it would be beautiful and it was. The songs he chose were perfect, like we picked them ourselves for our exact story, and the quality of his product and service was so worth it. He is integral, honest, and so kind hearted! If you are on the fence about hiring a videographer, just know that it is the thing I appreciate the most about my wedding day as I am able to look back and feel what it was like while watching. My husband and I were so grateful for Kyle and all he did. He goes above and beyond for his customers. Thank you Kyle Mize!!

Kind of weird Kyle Mize brags about telling “honest and genuine” stories with his videography when he very clearly discriminates against all gay couples and refuses them his servic...

es. Seems honestly and genuinely homophobic to me! Don’t hire this guy. There are far better videographers who are 100% more inclusive.

ed to go with Kyle. He was super easy to work with and the video that you get is amazing! Everyone loves the one he made for us. It looks more like a top 40 music video than a wedding video. Book him if you can get him

s team did an amazing job and the final product was just what we imagined! We also added the extra aerial footage and it just made the video that much more extravagant. It’s something we look forward to watch for many years to come!

wedding day. Although he was everywhere with his camera we did not even realize he was there and he was able to capture the most touching and breathtaking memories from our special day. The finished product was amazing and we are so happy we decided to go with Kyle. Thank you again for everything.

Booking Kyle Mize was the best decision we made throughout all of our wedding planning! One of the best things about Kyle is that he gave us so much of his time from start to finis...

h. Much more than we expected. When we were interested in booking him he called me to explain all of our options, what the wedding day timeline looks like and the process of putting together the footage after. He is so nice and personable and his prices were so much more affordable than every other videographer in the area so it was a no brainer to book him! I love music and the music that would play in our video really mattered to me, so I asked Kyle if it was ok if I chose the songs . He said it was no problem and directed me to the place he uses so I could choose. Once the wedding day came around there were some challenges with the traffic, Kyle was so flexible and generous with his time and offered to get there a little early to make sure he was able to make it from the guys to the girls without missing anything.Throughout the day he took so many creative shots, making sure he got every little detail and every big moment. He was so easy going and enjoyable to work with (our photographer said this as well) He also has the option to book “raw footage” which we are so happy we did as well. His wife shot the raw footage video while he was doing his artistic thing, the best combination! Once we received our video we were SO HAPPY! It was so clear he spent a great deal of time perfecting it and included even more footage than we expected. The lighting, the angles, the little details, the most important moments…it is beyond beautiful. There is no one out there who could have done a better job! And he is just the nicest person. We are so appreciative for the memories he captured that we will be able to watch forever and so grateful that we found him!
