Brian

Videographer

I was born in San Francisco. Ever since I was little I have loved photography/ videography. I bought my first camera at the age of 7 and haven't stopped taking photos and videos since. In 2021 I took my love for photography and turned professional. This past year, I can proudly say I took over ten thousand photos and do not plan on stopping any time soon. I would love you to be a part of my journey in the new year.

Sebastien Manceau

Owner

When I got my hands on a camera at a young age, I realized that I loved to capture moments as they happened. Beautiful moments amongst friends and family that would have otherwise faded into memory. I discovered a passion for telling stories through film, capturing special events with care so they could be enjoyed long into the future. You can count on us every step of the way to support you, to be there when it matters, and to capture beautiful video so we can tell your love story back to you genuinely and authentically.

Katie

Videographer

I have been taking pictures since I was little. It started with the most random photos. That camera went with me everywhere. Taking photos is something I love to do, especially when I travel. I've got to capture all of the amazing places I've been to. My goal is to always capture that special moment, either with a picture or a video. I think video sometimes gets that raw reaction to things that photos cannot get. It is truly beautiful.

We have nothing but incredibly good things to say about Sebastien and his work. There aren’t very many people in the world anymore that you can say are genuine, but Sebastien was n...

othing short of it. As soon as we met him and talked, our personalities all meshed well and felt like it was meant to be to have him film our wedding. We are a very easy going couple and did not have any expectations or requests for what we wanted or needed exactly, so we decided to leave it up to Sebastien as an artist to create something special and he did just that. It was very easy to communicate with him via email and phone. There was never a time where we felt like it was hard to get ahold of him. He created a proposal for us that was very easy to access which also made it really easy to make payment. After the wedding we realized that we forgot to ask for the raw footage, so we emailed Sebastien and he got back to us right away to let us know he could still send it! The day of the wedding Sebastien arrived promptly with a smile on his face per usual and made everyone feel so comfortable. Our photographer was someone he had previously worked with so if you need any help with finding a photographer Sebastian surely has someone good in mind. We found Sebastien through our photographer so it all worked out perfectly. The entire wedding was an absolute blast and he definitely tagged along and partied with us. We even went as far as asking if he’d like to stay after filming to continue having a good time (: We caught him laughing and joking with us and my family and friends, as if he had known us for a life time. There was no stress in any of the filming it all felt very easy and natural because he made it that way. He truly was an amazing person to work with and we would recommend him every time to anyone in need. Again, thank you for everything you have done and continue to do for people on their special day!

idly put at ease and excitement to have him as a part of our big day. Our chat was so seamless and comfortable, we felt heard and understood for what we had hoped for on our big day even though we had trouble trying to express our thoughts and vision. We loved the open conversations and really hit it off immediately. When it comes to having your big day full of candid and intimate moments, it makes all the difference to have someone like Sebastien there, he was super calm, cool and collected, nailing everything we asked for with precision and artistry. His approach of being right there beside you, yet a quiet shadow made everything so organic. His attention to detail and focus on what the goals were discussed in our initial meeting came together perfectly. Even for last minute changes he was super adaptable. We are so in love with our film, it perfectly captured our day that we will be able to watch over again for years to come. PS the drone shots were a stunning addition. Cannot recommend interstellar films enough!

llionth wedding of the year 3\. Quite literally the best wedding video of all time Sebastien is more skilled at videography than I can even put into words — our wedding video transported us right back to the day and somehow made it feel even more spectacular. He got so many incredible shots of our guests, the venue, moments I didn’t even notice! And the way he put it all together in the exact “vibe” we were looking for is true artistry. We will cherish this video for the rest of our lives. He’s also genuinely a kind and caring human being that will make your whole experience feel so much better, easier, and enjoyable (coming from someone who really hates taking photos!).

Sebastien made us feel so comfortable throughout the entire process - from the first time we chatted about our wedding videography vision with him, as he took the time to understand what we wanted and what was important to us, to spending time with him on our wedding day as he captured all of our special moments. If you are on the fence about getting a videographer for your wedding day - just go for it (and choose Interstellar Films)! Having all of our beautiful moments with our loved ones captured on video in such a cinematic, moving, sweet and joy-filled way is such a gift, and we can't wait to watch our films again and again as the years go by, getting to relive our best day ever. :) Thank you again to Sebastien/Interstellar Films for creating our dream wedding films, a truly priceless gift we will cherish forever!

If you want a full-on movie director at your wedding, Sebastien is your guy. We worked with Sebastien for our wedding video, and we can honestly say he made the best and entertain...

ing wedding videos we’ve ever seen - fun, quirky, epic, and more. First and foremost, he listens. We initially gave Sebastien a very rough direction - we liked landscape symmetrical shots, but also wanted a fun and less boring recap video. We briefly alluded to liking the cinematography of Wes Anderson films and the tv show Succession. Sebastien took that one comment, and turned our entire wedding into a full-on Hollywood production - with a wedding trailer in a Wes Anderson style and Wedding Video like the opening of Succession. He captured quirky fun moments throughout the wedding. He directed guests to participate in sarcastic skits. He captured landscape shots of the Conservatory of Flowers and Golden Gate Park where our wedding was. And as during a wedding there is so much going on - hugs, laughs, tears - that you never see personally, Sebastien captures every moment so you can relive your wedding from every angle. Sebastien had a vision, and stitched together the most hilarious and cute and warm wedding videos we could have asked for. Importantly, Sebastien himself is kind, warm and cordial. He listens to you, gathers your perspective and creative tastes. He really seeks to understand you, and represent your authentic self through video. It really felt magical to be part of a wedding that was also like being in a hollywood movie production. Thank you for making this cinephile’s dreams come true!

sy to navigate. Sebastien made us feel comfortable and confident every step of the way, and he captured every beautiful and meaningful moment of our day perfectly. When we received our wedding films (with such a reasonable turnaround time!), we were completely blown away. Every shot, every transition, every piece of storytelling was absolutely stunning — it felt like we were reliving our wedding all over again. Watching it brought my husband and me to tears of joy and gratitude. We feel so lucky and blessed to have had Sebastien be part of such an important chapter in our lives. His incredible talent and genuine passion truly shine through in every detail. If any of our friends or family ever ask for a wedding videographer, Interstellar Films will always be our number one recommendation. 💖

“The right vendor crew will support your wedding like a family.” This is something Sebastian said in his first call with us, and it remained true until well after our wedding date....

What initially drew us to Interstellar films was the filming style. We didn’t want an overly dramatic video, but we also didn’t wanted to reflect our own personal style. Sebastian listened, and with superb patience attended to all our questions/requests/anxieties. He delivered a tailored experience for us: filming on multiple days for multiple events (joint Indian/Russian wedding), in multiple locations, and coordinated well with our photographer. In the end, our wedding video turned out perfect. Then, when one of our parents requested an edit, Sebastian didn’t bat an eye. Interstellar really did support us like a family, with guidance, empathy, and sincerity, all for a very reasonable price. We couldn’t be happier!

We loved his highlight reel of our wedding so much that we bought the rest of the footage, and we’re so glad we did—he captured the tenderness of the speeches, the excitement of the first dance, and the whirlwind beauty of the ceremony (it was literally very windy and he made it look gorgeous). We also heard positive feedback about him from our other vendors—you always want someone who can work well with your team!

We are so happy we chose Sebastien, he was very professional but also incredibly personable. He made my husband and I comfortable from the minute he arrived. We can’t recommend him enough!

From our very first phone call, we knew Sebastien was the perfect choice as our videographer. His calming presence throughout the chaos that weddings can bring—both during planning...

and on the big day—was exactly what we needed. He took the time to understand our story, personalities, likes, dislikes, special moments, and family history, all for a reason. Working with him felt like working with an old friend. We had a few specific shot requests, but mostly, we asked for something timeless and elegant while giving Sebastien the creative freedom to work his magic. On our wedding day, I was anxious and stressed, but Sebastien's patience and care helped ground me. Despite a bit of chaos, he remained poised and calm. He blended in so seamlessly that there were moments when I forgot he was even a vendor. We didn’t want stuffy or unnatural footage. Instead, we had a blast filming spontaneous scenes—running, walking, dancing, and more—around our venue. I had high expectations based on the samples I’d seen, but nothing prepared me for what we received. To say we were blown away is an understatement. Our wedding film is not just a video—it’s a story. Every shot, voice-over, song, and transition was absolutely flawless. Honestly, it looks like something straight out of a movie. Those dreamy wedding videos you see on social media always seemed like a high-priced fantasy, but Sebastien delivered exactly that. Our video captured every aspect of our wedding day and our love for each other and our guests in such a beautiful, thoughtful, and artistic way. I can't recommend Sebastien enough. I am beyond grateful to have these memories captured so incredibly. His work is truly exceptional. Five stars doesn’t even begin to cover the quality and craftsmanship of his work.

k he does. Watching other videos he has produced, showed his attention to detail and an uncanny ability to bring out the connection between a couple and their family/friends. When we received our video after post production, it was amazing. The reason I wanted a video is the first place was to have something to share with family and friends that were unable to attend our special day. I feel like Interstellar was able to capture our emotions and show the joy we all experienced that day. The aerial shots of the coastline really brought out the beauty of our venue. Interstellar Films’s ability to use drones in their production really sets them apart from other vendors. The high quality of the images, the sound - everything was professional and reflected Interstellar Films standards. We love our wedding videos, our family and friends have enjoyed seeing our big day. These are videos that we will continue to watch over the years, the work really captured our love, our connection, our family/friends and all of the beautiful emotions of our wedding day. Thank you Interstellar Films -

o find a videographer and wanted a great one as my future son-in-law is a decerning photographer, thus I knew he would share my wish to hire a firm that could make an exquisite cinematic story. The couple chose Nestldown as the venue and due to the property’s vastness, we believed hiring a videographer with experience photographing this location made sense. I started with the venue’s preferred videographer list, reviewing for each videographer provided, websites and Instagram posts filmed at Nestldown. When I got to Interstellar Films I became immediately interested, their website was clean and modern, and the Instagram shorts films were so captivating I began watching all their videos. What attracted my attention was how Sebastien Manceau, owner of Interstellar Films can create videos with a very personal storytelling style, using intimate moments for each couple using nuances, and creative style that display the unique connection and energy that exists between the couple and their friends/family. Setting up a first call with Sebastien was simple, and I was happy to find the wedding date was still available on his calendar. He took the time to explain the different packages and listened as I conveyed the artsy feel, I hoped the videos would include. Furthermore, he understood that I wanted these videos to show a melding of two families and cultures (my son-in-law and his family are from El Salvador). On the day of the wedding, Sebastien arrived on time, had his equipment in hand, and was the ultimate professional. He made everyone immediately comfortable with his warm personality and calm demeanor. Collaborating with our photographer, Chloe Ramirez, he captured the most important parts of the day, the vows, speeches, and candid looks, and created films that are an absolute joy to watch. I am particularly pleased we selected the package which included the teaser film, it is super creative and can be shared via email or on Instagram. We highly recommend Sebastien Manceau and Interstellar Films. Sebastien provides fantastic service from start to finish. The couple is thrilled to have these quality videos to remember their day. Hiring Sebastien Interstellar Films was the perfect decision. Do not hesitate, book Interstellar Films if they are available.

My partner and I had debated for a while over whether we wanted to hire a videographer for our wedding. I am an extremely picky person, which made choosing vendors for our wedding ...

all the more difficult. We ultimately decided that having a videographer would be worth the cost. I probably looked at over 100 different videographer’s, before I came across Interstellar. We hopped on a call with Sebastien and could immediately tell that he’s incredibly passionate about what he does. Hiring him was a no brainer. He puts so much thought into the process, and it was completely stress free. On the wedding day, Sebastien was there, and also not there, in all the ways we could have asked for. It never felt like he was overbearing, or like there was a camera in our face. He was involved in a way that felt comfortable, considerate, and respectful. I hate hugging people, and I gladly hugged him at the end of the night, haha. There were parts of the day where my husband was visibly stressed, and Sebastien was always there to offer words of comfort, which put my husband at ease. After the wedding, Sebastien was very communicative regarding the completion date of the videos, which we appreciated. Once we received all of the videos, we were so blown away. All of his work exceeded any expectations we had. We’re so glad that we decided to book with Interstellar, because now we have several beautiful videos that we can watch on our anniversary, for years to come. Simply put, Sebastien is a man written by a woman - he’s a joy to be around, and if you’re getting married, you need to book him immediately! He’s the ultimate hype man.

We requested for him to record a fun “NFL game day” video of the groom and groomsmen walking into the venue before getting ready and he exceeded our expectations! The best part about having Sebastian as our wedding videographer is how he utilizes advanced technology to send me my wedding video. It wasn’t sent just as a clip in my email for me to download… he sent it in a way where I have an app on my phone Home Screen! This is so convenient because I don’t have to spend time looking through my files on my computer just to bring up my video. He also separated the video in categories for me, so if I’m looking for speeches, it’s super accessible! I love the convenience of being able to watch my wedding videos anytime I want right from my phone! Thank you so much Sebastien for creating lifelong memories for my husband and I!!
