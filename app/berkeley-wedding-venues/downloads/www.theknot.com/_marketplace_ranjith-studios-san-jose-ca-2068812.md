Ranjith did an incredible job photographing our wedding. He went above and beyond for our engagement shoot and for our wedding itself. It’s clear that Ranjith really loves what he ...

does. He was great at making us feel comfortable in front of the camera, and was able to pose us so that we looked great in the photos. The engagement shoot was great for us getting to know Ranjith and figuring out what worked best for the wedding itself in terms of angles, etc. The resulting photos from the wedding and engagement shoot were beyond what we expected - tastefully edited, great framing of each shot, and really captured the energy of our wedding.

We chose Ranjith because of his attention to detail and clear communication. He really knew what he was doing and helped us feel part of the process and confident in the plan. We couldn’t believe the photos he was able to capture - it was hard to believe it was just one person given how many beautiful moments he documented. He exceeded all our expectations--we absolutely love our photos.

Working with Ranjith as our wedding photographer was nothing short of incredible. From the very beginning, he brought such calm, positive energy to the entire process, making us fe...

el at ease and truly present in the moment. His ability to capture not only the big, important moments but also the small, in-between details was truly magical—every smile, every glance, every burst of laughter is preserved so beautifully in our photos. What stood out most was his eye for creativity and storytelling. The way he played with light, scenery, and angles brought out the natural beauty of our day and made every picture feel alive with emotion. He never felt intrusive, yet somehow managed to be everywhere he needed to be to catch those candid, authentic moments we’ll treasure forever. Beyond his artistry, Ranjith was a joy to work with—professional, kind, and genuinely passionate about his craft. Our family and friends couldn’t stop complimenting how comfortable they felt around him, which shines through in the photos. Looking back at our album, it feels like reliving our wedding day all over again, and that’s a priceless gift. We are so grateful to have had Ranjith with us on such a special day. If you’re looking for a photographer who blends incredible talent with heartfelt presence, I couldn’t recommend him more highly.

After a lot of searching, I came across Ranjith’s page on Google and immediately felt like he would be the perfect photographer for our special day — and I was right. From our ver...

y first call, Ranjith was incredibly warm, friendly, and approachable. He listened to all my ideas, took the time to understand the kind of pictures I wanted, and was more than happy to look at my mood boards and inspirations. Throughout the wedding and even afterward, Ranjit was a joy to work with — professional, calm, and always accommodating. He truly made the entire process easy and stress-free. Charan, our videographer who worked alongside Ranjith, was also amazing — so easy to work with and incredibly talented. I’m absolutely in love with the photos and the wedding film they created for us. Ranjith beautifully captured the essence of our special moments, and I couldn’t be more grateful. I would 100% recommend Ranjith to anyone looking for a talented, easygoing, and thoughtful photographer. Thank you so much, Ranjith! Harika & Yash

y moment beautifully. Despite our struggles with being photographed, Ranjith was incredibly patient and made us feel completely at ease. One of our favorite memories was during the Haldi ceremony. Ranjith managed to capture the joy on everyone's faces. They seamlessly fit into our chaotic family, becoming a part of the celebration rather than just an observer. Their attention to detail was impeccable and editing our videos to perfection. We were particularly impressed with how they edited the video of all our wedding events, making it look like a scene from a movie!!! We can't recommend Ranjith enough for anyone looking for a talented and understanding wedding photographer. They made our special day even more memorable with their incredible work.

ding someone who could truly understand our vision. After seeing his amazing reviews and speaking with him, we felt at ease immediately. Ranjith was incredibly friendly, and his professionalism shone through from the start. He took the time to listen to our ideas and understand our vision, while also offering his expertise and suggestions. We were constantly in touch leading up to the wedding, finalizing the schedule for the shoot and discussing the kinds of shots we wanted. Ranjith was always readily available to answer questions, even helping with practical details like the best placement for the stage at our daytime Sangeet to ensure the lighting was perfect. On the day of both the Sangeet and wedding, Ranjith arrived bright and early with a smile, full of energy and fresh ideas. He put us both at ease and knew exactly what to do, making sure we got all the shots we wanted in the time we had set aside. When the final photos arrived, we were beyond thrilled with the results. Every shot was beautifully captured and exactly what we had hoped for. We will cherish these photos forever and are so grateful to Ranjith for making our wedding memories so special. If you're looking for a photographer who is not only talented but also truly listens to your vision and makes the entire experience stress-free, Ranjith is the one to go with! We couldn't recommend him more!

Ranjith was super communicative and thorough from start to finish, we did a warm up session of photos with him a couple weeks before the wedding, which was a great way to loosen up in front of the camera. His warm and supportive personality was so comforting, and the photo collection went above and beyond capturing the special day. We can't recommend him enough!

I've planned weddings for over 15 years and I have never come across a more down to earth, communicative, punctual, respectful photographer like Ranjith. On your wedding day you ...

want feel each moment and not worry about whether the photos are gonna come out right in the end. With Ranjith you can do just that, you will not need to direct him, follow up with him, check in on him. He'll have your back! Let's check some boxes: punctual, affordable, creative, professional, calm, excellent communicator, fantastic human being! I hired Ranjith to cover my best friends wedding. The wedding was a mix of Nigerian, Latino and Indian cultures. Ranjith covered the Mehendi night in Alameda and the wedding ceremony and reception in Oakland. What Ranjith did was deliver to us the story of Lucy and James in an vivid series of portraits that to this day induces a flood of emotions at the intensity of what was experienced on the day of the event itself. Ranjith is able to see the possibilities for creating art with people and settings within a matter of seconds. For the couple's portrait shoot at Preservation park; a venue he had not seen even in photos before the day, we had just under 45 mins of time. I was amazed by the volume and stunning compositions he came up with in that short space of time, never losing his cool under pressure. He even delivered the photos ahead of time and I was able to publish a complete photo album for them in time for Christmas! You will love your photos and you will love Ranjith!

the angles that suited us both. He managed to capture all the details as well of the ceremony site and the decor. And we loved the editorial shots he captured at the end. It was lovely that he even offered a pre-wedding shoot to make us feel comfortable and to get to know us as a couple since we were abroad for most of the planning. And he would always go the extra mile - getting the photos and videos to us so quickly, and even giving us the raw video files of the ceremony and couriering it over to my mom so that she could hand it to me! For any daytime wedding, Ranjith is ideal!

It was an absolute pleasure working with Ranjith and his team. Ranjith was very easy to reach and incredibly friendly right off the bat. He offered to meet with us in-person before...

the wedding to go through the details of our wedding. We chose him because of how personalized the experience felt. It was clear that he cared about our wedding as much as we did. On the wedding day, Ranjith and his team arrived early and were so efficient. It's amazing to look at the photos now and see how many tiny details he captured with such a gorgeous aesthetic. Despite being an artist myself and very picky, I am blown away by how stunning the photos and video turned out. Ranjith was also so friendly with everyone that many of our guests still remember his name. I highly, HIGHLY recommend Ranjith as your wedding (or other event) photographer. Wedding planning is stressful enough, and Ranjith took the so much stress off of our plates with his attention to detail, passion, and talent. He was a gem to work with and we could not have asked for better photos to capture our special day.

ted from a photography perspective, but Ranjith came up in our Google searches for photographers in the Bay Area. We were on a tight budget and Ranjith was able to accommodate our needs. Before the event, Ranjith reached out several times to go over details and was flexible with our busy schedules. He was eager to cater to every request we made. On the day of the event, he was early and ready to start photographing as soon as he got there. Ranjith was professional, over the top in pleasantries with our guests and family members, and ensured everyone felt comfortable being photographed. We had a few commutes, as our locations for getting ready, the ceremony, and the reception were all in different locations, and he was able to be everywhere at the perfect times, flawlessly. He was able to capture our wedding day with such splendor and luminosity, and we can't thank him enough. Our special day wouldn't have been what it was without the help of Ranjith. Needless to say, the photos came out spectacular - all of those friends and family can't stop raving about how well they turned out! We even received our full 700+ photo gallery within just a few weeks of the event. We are so pleased with how much time, effort, and care Ranjith put into our wedding day. We can't recommend him enough. Thanks again, Ranjith. \- The Grey's

I worked with Ranjith for my wedding a few weeks ago and working with him was great!!! From the first time I contacted him, he always made sure to get back to me in a timely manner...

. I would get responses within minutes no matter what time of day it was. This was especially pleasing for someone like me who likes to plan everything down to the minute detail. He was also great with respect to discussing my vision prior to the wedding. He got on a few calls with me and made sure that he understood everything that I wanted to come out of my photos. He was also great with learning how to navigate unplanned scenarios. It was potentially going to rain on my wedding day and he was very diligent in creating a new plan for the photography vision indoors. Finally, on the day of the wedding Ranjith was nothing but great! He suggested a second photographer for my large venue, which was the perfect choice to get all different types of angles during the ceremony! He was there every step of the way and made sure that he captured some of the most important moments of my life. I got the photos back in less than three weeks and they were STUNNING! I couldn’t help but tear up looking at how perfect they came out. I received tons of compliments from people around me regarding how fabulous they looke. Overall, Ranjith is a professional, dedicated, and talented photographer! 10/10 would recommend!

o incredibly responsive in the time leading up to it. Reasonably priced and professional. He reached out to coordinate logistics well ahead of time, and on the day of, was prompt, really lovely and soft-spoken and of course, took fabulous photos which he promptly delivered 2 weeks after. I really do appreciate everything, especially the incredible city hall, and temple wedding photos. It was a pleasure working with him!

o there. From the very beginning, he was easy to work with, agreeing to work with us on short notice as our plans faced some trouble and making the process easy. During the photo shoot, Ranjith created a fun and relaxed atmosphere, allowing us to truly enjoy our special day. His professionalism and friendly demeanor made it easy to work with him. When we received the final photos, we were absolutely thrilled with the results. We are happy to have had Ranjith capture these precious moments and would highly recommend him to anyone looking for a talented and reliable photographer for their special events.

One of our biggest concerns was that since we are a multi-racial family, we needed a photographer that could photograph various skin tones in the same shot and not wash out one or ...

the other. We were delighted that his portfolio displayed his skill! Ranjith was communicative from day one. He made sure our schedules aligned and followed up as our wedding date approached. On the big day he arrived early to set up and surveyed the area while the wedding party got ready so he could get the most optimal shots. He was incredible at blending in that he got really nice candid shots and was great at directing the guests and making them feel comfortable. We were so happy with his work and candor that we can't wait to use him again in our future family portraits!!!

Ranjith, our wedding photographer truly went above and beyond to capture the special moments of our big day. Every shot was well thought out and beautifully executed, with a keen...

eye for detail and a creative flair that made the images truly unique. What impressed me most about Ranjith, however, was his patience. He managed to capture stunning images even in challenging lighting and weather conditions. Ranjith was always willing to take the time to get the perfect shot, and never made anyone feel rushed or uncomfortable. I highly recommend him for his talent and professionalism. Thank you, Ranjith, for creating such beautiful memories of our special day!

Oh boy did we luck out finding Ranjith on Craigslist of all places! Haha. I am Indian and my husband is a white man and we had an Indian/ White wedding at the courthouse. One thin...

g I was certain on was wanting an Indian photographer to shoot our wedding pictures. I got in touch with Ranjith and he got back to me fairly quickly and we negotiated a good deal (he was very fair a reasonable) and we signed a contract. I did his work prior on Instagram. He was on time on wedding day and we actually enjoyed taking our pictures. One thing we definitely didn’t want to do was pose artificially. Ranjith made it organic and fun. Even our ten year old daughter loved posing for him. We got some wonderful shots. We got our pics sent to us in an album and my husband even ordered wedding announcement cards from the website. Ranjith even made a wedding book for us, which was the sweetest thing ever! Overall…we highly highly recommend Ranjith. Not only is he a fabulous photographer, but he’s a wonderfully sweet and kind human.

t he was willing to drive from San Jose all the way to Fresno to take the pictures at our venue. He made us feel very comfortable as he took pictures . He also had poses for us to try, which is helpful for someone like me that doesn't really know how to pose for pictures. Another great thing about Ranjith was that hesent us several photos that he edited for us to preview before sending us all of the beautifully edited photos he did for us. I would definitely recommend Ranjith as a photographer. He was easy to contact and communicate with.
