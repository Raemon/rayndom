Kim is the absolute best florist and business owner I have worked with. I had absolutely no idea what I wanted and needed for my wedding and Kim was prepared with many ideas and op...

tions. She listened to what I liked and didn’t like and made arrangements that were entirely cooler than anything I could have ever come up with. She made the entire process easy and stress free. I had a special item I needed her to add into 4 boutonnière’s and she did everything in her power to make it work the way I wanted it to and she succeeded. I absolutely recommend Kim for all of your floral needs, especially large events and weddings. She is a true professional and clearly shows her passion through her work.

Kim was absolutely INCREDIBLE to work with! As a wedding planner, my bride decided somewhat last minute to add two large alter pieces to her Ceremony. Kim not only delivered on thi...

s, but went ABOVE and BEYOND! She assisted in finding the proper stands from a different local florist, and even picked them up on the client's behalf! The alter pieces looked even better than the inspo photo sent out & we re-used them at the Sweetheart Table. The wedding would not have been the same without Marmalade's floral elements. THANKS, KIM!
