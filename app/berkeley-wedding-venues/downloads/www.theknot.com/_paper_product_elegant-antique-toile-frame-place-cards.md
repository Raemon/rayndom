Details

The Bridgerton x The Knot collection speaks to couples planning a wedding inspired by the Regency era, down to every last elegant flourish. Find a design that reflects your epic romance only on The Knot.   
With an antique toile aesthetic and minimalist color scheme, these place cards will guide your wedding guests to their seats. Each guest's name glides across the card in a regal script, with the table assignment outlined in a serif typeface. Below, rests a minimalist bed of flowers for an endearing, vintage aesthetic.   
Select how many cards you would like printed and after you’ve placed your order, a designer will send you a spreadsheet to fill out your guests' names. After you’ve placed your order, send your completed spreadsheet to help@theknot.com with your order number included in your email, and a designer will send you a digital proof of all of your cards before printing.   
A variety of meal icons are now available! If you would like to include meal info on your place cards, simply enter your guests’ meal choices to your spreadsheet, ordered by meal preference - and our designers will include them in your digital proofs. 

**Size:** 3.5 x 5 inches
