eate beautiful looks for both my mother and my mother-in-law, and I couldn’t have been happier with how everything turned out. They also did stunning hair for all of my bridesmaids. Each bridesmaid had the chance to chat with Jen and collaborate on a hairstyle that perfectly suited their hair texture and dress, which made everyone feel so confident and special. Jen was amazing—polite, friendly, and so easy to talk to. She fit right in with us and genuinely felt like part of the fun on such a special day. I have nothing but wonderful things to say and would highly recommend them to any bride looking for a seamless, joyful, and beautiful bridal experience! Love the Powder Room!

king questions throughout the process to make sure it was exactly what I wanted. Transparently, I didn’t know exactly what I wanted because I was overloaded with so much bridal content that after the trial I realized it wasn’t what I wanted. The week of the wedding I texted Ashley, and shared over my feedback and the tweaks I wanted to make and she was all on board. Come wedding day, we discussed the tweaks further and she made it happen. I literally felt my vision came to light. The rest of my wedding party all had a great experience working with the stylists and all looked gorgeous. So happy I worked with The Powder Room for my wedding! I appreciate all the hard work 💜

I'm almost a year late in my review but better late than never. I planned my wedding in June of last year and holy moly the powder room is so amazing. I worked with DeeAnna and her...

team and they were all amazing. To start, the person who emails is super responsive and helpful. I then had a trial with DeeAnna and it was great. She is super personable, kind, and just incredible at what she does. The day of my wedding I did decide to go bigger on the lashes and she adjusted and it was just perfect. I looked stunning (if I do so say myself). She was incredible. The other tricky part for her was that I needed my updo to stay put even during our first dance which included three acrobatic tricks. IT DID NOT MOVE. The other key piece of information is my hair is long and heavy and I never once got a headache from my hair do. I seriously wished I lived closer so that I could have her do my hair and make up for every event. It would be so worth it. I just highly recommend her.

rough some of my concerns, she put my mind at ease that we'd get it right on wedding day. She was right! A few friends and family members joined me at the salon for a few services so we essentially had a run of the place for a few hours one Saturday morning. Appreciated The Powder Room catering to our reservations, but it was definitely no frills given the money we spent there that morning. I would have been nice to have some fun wedding-themed music playing or some type of special set-up for our group, so if you're looking for that type of experience with your bridal party, plan on creating it yourself. Overall, though, everyone was happy with their services and I truly loved the look Jenifer created for me.

ly recommend doing the bridal hair and makeup trial as I wasn't fully sure what I wanted and ended up tweaking a couple things on the day-of. In addition to my bridesmaids, they also did hair and makeup for my sister-in-law, my mom, and a number of my mom's friends who wanted to try it out. Some came armed with inspiration photos and others just asked them to do whatever they thought would look best. Everyone was so happy with the results! DeeAnna wasn't phased by the different ages, hair lengths, style choices, or skin tones of those involved - we were all very impressed. My sister-in-law has been in a lot of weddings and has had mediocre hair/makeup done many times but said that DeeAnna was really one of the best experiences she's had. Our hair and makeup looked great all night! It was a warm day and all I had to do was dab on a little bit of powder once or twice throughout the night if I thought I was getting shiny. I can't recommend The Powder Room enough!

Although my makeup turned out fine in photos, the makeup artist, Asheley, startled me the day of my wedding, when she neglected to look at any of the notes I gave her on my makeup ...

2 weeks before. In February 2019, I came into the Powder Room for a 2 hr hair and makeup consult and after speaking with Asheley re: colors and styles, she did my hair and makeup and I gave her feedback on what I liked and didn't like. Fast forward to early July before my late July wedding, I had a 30 min phone call with Asheley, emphasizing my feedback on how I felt the H & M she did was too dark and the curls were too tight and heavy, etc. Fast forward to my wedding day, and she failed to take any of my feedback into consideration and just replicated my H & M from our February consult, that I had repeatedly stated was too dark, too heavy and just was not me. I was shocked and at that point, only had 10 min until my photographer showed up to take pictures and follow me to my wedding venue. My hair looked like something from a debutante ball, huge and teased and far from the beachy loose waves I asked for, and I almost cried right then and there. I definitely cried a lot after getting my photos back. I am disappointed in the lack of professionalism Asheley had and how put out she acted when I asked if she could lighten my lip color before she left. She was almost silent for the 2+ hrs she was with me and my family on the wedding day, only speaking up to ask how long it would take her to drive out of Stinson Beach--just generally acting like she did not want to be there. She completely disregarded my notes, even after stating she wanted to make everything "perfect" for my special day. To top it all off--she gave my mom a PURPLE lip color as if that was ok and natural, also disregarding the notes I had emailed her about my mom's day-of look. Would not recommend, not worth the price, and likely to put a major damper on your special day.

ith her and did makeup and hair for women, young woman and little girls ages 73 to 5. Mary gave everyone the look they wanted; no one got a cookie cutter look and she was having fun with us. During my trial run, she accommodated me and went 50 miles out of her way to meet me when I missed an appointment! I am going back to Mary for makeup for makeup and hair for a professional event. She is a STAR!! WONDERFUL!!!!

I cannot even begin to describe how wonderful our experience was with Deanna and her team from the powder room. Deanna and Alicia came to do wedding makeup and hair for me, my mom,...

mother in law and makeup for all my bridesmaids. They were so kind and helpful with making the girls feel comfortable and themselves! My hair and makeup was EXACTLY what I wanted and imagined for my special day. I can’t thank these very talented women enough! I would highly recommend the Powder Room and especially Deanna and Alicia!

ne to fix my hair on the most important day was scary for me. Jenifer is great. I have had my hair styled for many events and I was so thrilled with the gorgeous vintage look. I gave her a photo I found on line. I have long hair and I wanted to wear it down with curls. In my opinion my hair looked better than the photo. My hair looked absolutely beautiful on my wedding day. Thanks, Jennifer.

r already busy schedule with only a two month notice, but also when I needed to change the time of my appointment for the day of our wedding. At the Powder Room I had the pleasure of working with Corrinne. When we first met for my trial we discussed my dress, my likes and dislikes, and went over a few photos that I had brought along. Then she worked her magic. In just under two hours Corrinne had taken my hair and makeup vision and made it into a reality. The wedding day was even easier and I couldn’t have been happier; she definitely exceeded my expectations. Corrinne is incredibly professional, easy to talk to, and fun to work with! Overall, my experience at the Powder Room was incredibly positive and I am grateful for all the hard work that went into making our wedding day even more special!

The team arrived promptly on the big day. Everyone looked fabulous. Our hair and make up lasted well into the next day. Everyone looked perfect! My bridal party looked stunning. I could not have been more pleased! I highly recommend!!

ldn't quite articulate. I wanted a more natural look and I'm not used to wearing a lot of makeup and Mary was able to apply everything in a way that made sure I still felt like myself. I wanted some fresh flowers incorporated into my hair and she did the morning of impromptu in such a beautiful way. She and another stylist came to our location and did not only my hair/makeup but my four bridesmaids and my mom and mother-in-law. They were so sweet and fun and everyone looked gorgeous! So glad I got to have Mary make the special day even more special!

Heather Romero and her team did my wedding makeup and hair for me and my bridesmaids, moms, and aunts for our August 2017 wedding and we all loved how it turned out! I did my trial...

a few months earlier in which Heather really put me at ease and came up with a great bridal look for me based on my inspiration images. I don't (and neither does my bridal party) wear a lot of makeup, so I was concerned I would look overly done up. I was pleasantly surprised that I still felt natural, (like I could still see my own skin through the foundation) yet with some nice added drama for photos. They also showed up on time ready to roll and got done a few minutes ahead of schedule which was awesome. Thank you Heather and team!

Elyse was amazing. She made me feel beautiful on my wedding day!!! From the beginning, I couldn't have been happier with the service that I received! When I had to last minute ...

reschedule my hair and make-up trial - she was incredibly flexible. Then, when I showed up for the trial, she made me feel so special and was incredibly attentive. I wanted to go for a natural look - but be my prettiest self, and she nailed it. She also helped me articulate what I really wanted - I wanted my hair to look soft but elegant, and my make-up to be appropriate for an outdoor wedding, but still something a little bit more dramatic than my normal minimal make-up look. Then - the best was the wedding. Elyse and her assistant did hair and make-up for me, my 2 sisters, my mom, and my husband's mom. I knew she was going to make me look and feel beautiful, but I couldn't believe how stunning everyone in my family looked - and how confident we all felt! Elyse was incredible with listening to the look that everyone wanted and then pulling out the perfect shades from her toolkit for all. I can't speak highly enough of her work!
