s not only highly knowledgeable but also genuinely passionate to help shape our wedding experience. He was incredibly organized, managing details with precision and ensuring everything ran smoothly on our big day. What really stood out was his friendly and approachable nature. Aokash made us feel at ease, listened attentively, and offered thoughtful advice that helped us refine our ideas. The wedding itself was a wonderful day, thanks to Aokash's expertise. He kept everything on track, allowing us to truly enjoy our celebration without worry. If you're looking for a wedding planner who combines expertise with warmth and a personal touch, look no further than Kiara Event Planning. We couldn't have asked for a better experience

ecially appreciated his expertise and input in areas where we were less opinionated or didn't have as clear of a vision. He handled every situation perfectly as it came up, and made sure we were able to focus on enjoying our celebration during the day of.

It was closer to my wedding date and I was very overwhelmed with planning my own wedding, I had enough and decided to put in some money to get a wedding coordinator. Aokash has bee...

n very helpful and clear what he helps with. He's Desi, so he has experience in Indo/pak weddings, that was my plus. We purchased the day of coordination package. Aokash communicated with the vendors, before and during the event. He is a good speaker and helped me out on small things too, like grabbing me a cup of tea while my husband and I had to greet the guests. I still had to do a lot of work (example: making a music list and forwarding timelines to all vendors) prior to the event, but I think that is expected when purchasing smallest package. Aokash did go over my drafted timeline and confirmed if it was all good. Again, I had to do the preparation prior to bringing in Aokash. One great thing is, day of... you don't have to worry one bit. My advice put some money to get a coordinator and Aokash is definitely my recommended guy.

re all vendors were communicated with before and throughout the actual wedding and when it came to gathering our things at the end of the night. He was a great MC as well with the perfect delivery of humor. I highly recommend booking Kiara Event Planning for your next big event. I will be recommending them to all my friends.

on where some of our vendors cancelled last minute due to COVID. And that’s when we called Kiara Events - Kash and Sharon stepped in and saved the day. Not only did they help us find reliable vendors, they also coordinated all the details of the day. It was super easy to work with this duo , they listened to our vision and made it happen. We had peace of mind on the day of our event, knowing that they will take care of everything with our vendors!
