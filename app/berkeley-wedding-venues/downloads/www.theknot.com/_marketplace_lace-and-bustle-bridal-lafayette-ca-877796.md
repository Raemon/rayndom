with some changes. When we arrived, I had an idea of some styles I was looking for, but then Victoria (sensing my indecisiveness) rolled out 2 carts, one with tops and one with bottoms. She put together the PERFECT dress using 3 separate pieces. She showed me so many different ways that I could create the dress and we eventually settled on the perfect style. The dress was eventually sewn into a single piece, and they were so communicative throughout the entire process of waiting and then tailoring. I felt so taken care of, and their overall excitement for me and about the dress made the whole process even more enjoyable.

L&B because of how great my experience was. They take the time to listen to what you want, you feel no pressure to make a decision and are give so many helpful tips for getting prepared for the big day. The first time I went, I brought my MOH, mother - in law and a few bridesmaids. They made the experience fun for everyone, giving us some drinks and letting us all wear veils :) I couldn't speak more highly of Sierra and the crew there. Highly highly recommend L&B!

one-they figured out her style right away. Now here I am a few months later, and I found my dress with them, too! I have a totally different style from my sister, and they caught that right away and pulled out dresses that I loved. They are so kind, and amazing at what they do. When I had a question if my shoes would go with the dress, they let me come in again to try on the sample dress with the shoes. I know no one else would take care of us like they have, and it will always be so special that both my sister and I found our dresses here. So excited to be an L&B Bride!

at to do and understood my taste immediately. Not only is the boutique itself beautiful and clean, the dresses they have are amazing! So amazing in fact, I couldn't pick just one. The whole time I was trying on different dresses, they made me feel beautiful and special. They also treated my mother who was with me incredibly well too which meant a lot to the both of us. Once my dresses came in, Victoria even came to the first tailor appointment with me to make sure everything went smoothly. I cannot emphasize enough how great the customer service has been and how fantastic the dresses are! Thank you Lace and Bustle for everything :)

ace I went to look for dresses, and the boutique is gorgeous and intimate. They made my appointment their priority, and we had the place to ourselves which was really nice. I showed Victoria my Pinterest board of dresses I liked and admitted I had no idea what I wanted. She was able to look at the photos and knew immediately what I would like. She was also very cognizant of my budget. I ended up finding two dresses that I LOVED that were impeccable, but because this was my first dress appointment, I was not ready to make the call yet. They were not pushy at all and suggested I go to other shops then come there after to compare them in the same day to help choose with the dresses fresh in my mind. I went to 2-3 other dress shops, and my experiences there were nothing compared to Lace & Bustle. L&B was much more attentive, professional, and a calm and not pushy ambiance. I could not get the dresses at L&B out of my head, and ended up purchasing my dream dress there and could not be happier. If anyone is looking to have a fantastic, special, worry free wedding dress experience, then this is the place! Lace & Bustle definitely set the bar high for my dress hunt and was so excited to purchase my dress with them in the end.

sn't feel overwhelming. Their staff is incredibly lovely and knowledgeable. They made the whole experience so enjoyable. I worked with Sierra and she was amazing. I felt so calm with her. She was easy-going and very positive. She pulled amazing dresses that matched exactly what I was looking for and helped me narrow down my choices. When I knew I would need to come back to make my final decision, Sierra worked with my schedule so I could come back the next weekend. If you are looking for a relaxed and positive shopping atmosphere, I would highly recommend Lace and Bustle.

ink back to my first visit here, their dress collections were fairly small compared to other ones I've been to but I can truly say that I loved all the dresses at Lace & Bustle. I mostly communicated with Victoria and she was super nice from the beginning. She made me feel special as a bride. She was very kind and suggested me to try on different type of dresses to make sure I tried on enough silhouette so that I can decide on the dress shape that I loved the most. I instantly fell in love with this A-line/semi-ball gown dress from Matthew Christopher. When I tried on this dress, I truly felt like a bride. Just like any other brides though, I wanted to go visit more bridal places to see more options. After 5 months of searching for THE dress, I had to come back here because I could not forget that one dress I tried on at this boutique. I could never find a dress like that from any other bridal shops in the bay area. I can guarantee you that this boutique carries the most beautiful ballgowns/A-line dresses from the bay area. They absolutely carry the most beautiful lace dresses. I ended up going to more than 10+ bridal shops while dress shopping and for me to end up back in my first boutique tells you alot. Even though the price of the dress was little bit out of my initial range, I'm so glad I went for the dress that I fell in love with. It was truly an unforgettable experience! I would totally recommend this shop to all my friends :)

Her dresses and the services received were absolutely wonderful, and everyone MUST go to this boutique!!!! Thank you Victoria! You're an artist!

At my first visit, I tried on a couple of dresses that I adored. After going to a couple other stores I couldn't get the gowns or the impeccable customer service of Lace and Bustle out of my head. I went back and immediately knew I had my gown! Lace and Bustle is beautiful and comfortable with truly special service. I would go back again and again! Don't miss out on this gem.

Lace and Bustle is an intimate bridal boutique that provides excellent, knowledgeable service in a relaxed, quiet and elegant setting. I had a lovely experience there working with...

Victoria and Sierra, who gave me their undivided attention. They selected several dresses for me to try on based on the information I gave them on what I was looking for, and were honest and gracious with their feedback about how each dress looked on me. I especially appreciate the accurate measurements they took (and retook several times to make sure they were right). I did not expect to find a dress right away but I did and their store was the first and only store I visited. Because their measurements were so accurate, the alterations required for the dress are minimal. I went in for my first fitting at the tailor today, and I was quite impressed that except for minor alterations to shorten the straps and sew in a padded bra for my flat chest, everything fit perfectly, and the hem was the exact perfect length. If you want personalized service, attention to your vision of your ideal dress, and professional guidance in a lovely intimate setting, Lace and Bustle is the place to go. Absolute excellence in the quality of dresses, quality of service, and quality of the entire experience. Thank you, Lace and Bustle for contributing to my special day!

I am so thankful to this boutique and their amazing staff...I was lucky to work with Victoria, Sierra and Liliam (Victoria's mother). They are so personable and hands on! This was ...

my first time wedding dress shopping so I was clueless. It never crossed my mind that I would basically be naked in front of someone I barely knew while they helped me in and out of wedding dresses! But these ladies made me feel so comfortable that it wasn't awkward at all. They were very patient and I never felt rushed. They asked me how I felt in every dress and how it compared to the last and I could tell they genuinely cared. I went to another boutique in Walnut Creek and my experience was quite the opposite...I was handed each dress and expected to get into them myself. The woman helping me didn't seem interested in getting to know me or anything about my wedding. When you walk into Lace & Bustle it's a completely different experience, they welcome you warmly and you instantly feel at home. I'm proud to say this is where I said "Yes!" to the dress! This is the moment all brides dream about...thank you L&B for making this crucial part of wedding planning such a positive and amazing experience for me!

URGENT--Brides to be PLEASE read!! I flew from Phoenix to Northern California to search for THE wedding dress. My sister scheduled 8 bookings at 8 different locations (just in case...

I didn't find the one) in two days. I went to top of the line boutiques in Walnut Creek, San Francisco, and Livermore. The dresses I tried on were very, very beautiful but it didn't FEEL like it was the one if that makes sense. And I am not necessarily high maintenance either after all it's just a big celebration right? But I wanted to fall in love with my dress--I'm financially investing into the big day anyways. So as I was trying on dress after dress, location after location, I started to become kind of sad and "over it." I thought I found the dress in Walnut Creek because it looked good on me and it was a popular boutique with great reviews, but I found myself convincing myself and my family of all the reasons it was the right dress. WRONG!!! So I slept on it. I woke up the next day and something told me to google search wedding dress boutiques northern California (I mean I already did this prior to flying out there, maybe I missed something). And Lace & Bustle popped up. I checked it out and on a whim decided to go last minute before I made the decision to purchase the other dress. I walked in Lace & Bustle -- immediately the girls are beyond sweet (it was very encouraging after my horrible experience so far) and they genuinely cared about my best interest which is refreshing since most boutiques were trying to sell me on why their dress/store was the best. I saw a dress in the corner of my eye and there it was (like a movie I know). Literally I kid you not, I tried it on and said out loud "You've got to be kidding me!" After ALMOST SETTLING for the other dress and after searching and digging I found the dress and it was at the very last store. My sister and I started to cry. It was "the one." And btw I am NOT a crier, I think it's cheesy when women cry over a dress but it was a feeling and you just know on the inside. Just like picking your husband, you just know it's the "one" and you are confident in your decision. Anyways I can write a book on my experience clearly. But I encourage you to try on different dresses (what you thought was the dress you had in mind might not be), be patient, and just check this store out. Victoria is beyond amazing and throughout the whole stress of wedding planning she's always been so uplifting and has physically been there to all of my fittings (and she's the owner of the store). She is so helpful and supportive. If I was a millionaire and could wear two wedding dresses on my wedding day I would've picked another dress from this store as well. I absolutely LOVED my dress. I wanted to sleep in it lol. It really made my wedding day (along with my husband of course) and I have beautiful pictures for my future kids to see. I am beyond grateful for Victoria and her team. Best wishes future brides!!!! xoxo

For one, the idea of shopping is something I absolutely dread. So, I knew attempting to find a wedding dress wouldn't be much different. I began by going on Pinterest and finding a...

n overall style that I liked. Eventually, I ran into a dress I absolutely loved and searched my area for the designer; which is how I found Lace and Bustle. I made an appointment online and mentioned I was interested in the specific dress. They wasted no time to call and let me know they did not have the dress in store, but could reach out to the designer and see if a sample could be sent over for the day I was requesting. If not, we could reschedule my day for when that specific dress would be in the store. About a week later, I received a call informing me the dress would be there on the date I was originally going to go; in all, about two weeks. I set up the appointment and kept my party small; four of us total. We were the only ones in the store when we got there and I just fell in love with the shop. I honestly always imagined walking into a bridal salon and going into full panic mode from feeling overwhelmed, but not here. The whole process was relaxing and to my surprise, fun! I kept an open mind throughout the process and tried on things I knew I likely would not pick, but that was part of the process. To my surprise, I fell in love with a blush ball gown. However, the original dress I went in for came out on top. The whole process was great and I really appreciated this place. I gave them a budget to stay within and they did so. In fact, I walked away with over half my dress budget. I actually got a call a few weeks ago from Victoria letting me know my dress had been ordered and she would be in contact with me for fittings and such. She also let me know they would be getting a sample of my dress in the store this summer so I can go and try it on again with different accessories and shoes, which I am very excited for. I highly recommend Lace and Bustle to anyone searching for a wedding dress. This place has been amazing to me thus far and I cannot wait to continue working with them for the rest of this process!

nothing more off-putting than feeling like a dime-a-dozen when you're buying for your dream wedding. It was like having a private event for my bridesmaids and me. I went to several dress boutiques and they were all charming, but a little pushy and just felt like they steamrolled over me and my desires or forced me to like dresses that I was lukewarm to to sell me. Going to Lace and Bustle was a huge departure from that unpleasant experience. They were so kind, asked all the right questions, and just seemed to understand exactly what I wanted. I showed them a few pictures of pinterest pins I had saved and briefly described what I was looking for, and man! Seriously the first dress I put on was the one that took my breath away. We of course tried several others to really get a feel for all they had selected for me, but we all just knew that we needed to go back to that first one. They asked the best questions while I was wearing the dress to get me to really think about what I liked, they never pushed me or made me feel guilty if I didn't like something about a dress. They worked with me, not against me. They made me feel SO comfortable. The best part was that they suggested that I leave the store, think about it for a few days, look at the pictures and then make my decision because they understood that this was a HUGE decision to make and one that gets muddled if a sales pitch is made. They were by far the best boutique I went to during this whole tour of boutiques around the bay area looking for my gown. I honestly fell in love with their dress and with how amazing their customer service was. I cannot recommend this place highly enough! I will definitely recommend them to all of my friends getting married in the area throughout the years.

r to going to Lace and Bustle, I was not having a good time trying on dresses. I went all over San Francisco and Marin County - I must have tried on at least 75 dresses with zero luck. I knew what I wanted and I was not finding it anywhere. Someone who lives in Lafayette recommended I try Lace and Bustle and I wish it had been the first place I went to! I immediately felt at ease when I walked in; Victoria is so sweet and welcoming, the store is absolutely gorgeous, and the quality and selection of the dresses is outstanding. Victoria really listened to what I was looking for and the very first dress she put me in, ended up being the one! Don’t bother going anywhere else but here, I guarantee you will find the dress of your dreams! Thank you so much Victoria, you’re the best!

The staff at L&B are AMAZING. So helpful, kind, and genuine. The shop itself is beautiful and the quality of gowns second to none. Trust me, I went to a few (what felt like hundred...

salons) and this was the only salon where I actually enjoyed myself. Prior to my appointment I shared with the team my Pinterest page and when I arrived at the salon, Victoria had hand selected the dresses she knew I would love. Lace and Bustle was my first bridal appointment and it should have been my last. When it was all said and done Victoria waived the rush fees so I would receive the dress with time for alterations. She even got on the phone with the designer to make sure the waist was going to hit me where it was meant to (tall bride problems). Highly, highly recommend. I ended up going with her local tailor even though I live in the city and the BART trips were worth it. Victoria MET me at my first appointment, hand delivered the dress, and stayed with me to make sure everything was perfect - a big deal for a bride doing the shopping on her own. Even now, a few months after the wedding I find myself scrolling through the photos of all of the dresses I tried on and the dresses I tried from Lace & Bustle are still the best in the area.

was very attentive and incredibly helpful throughout the whole process; she even brought my dress to their recommended tailor and stayed for my first dress fitting which was one of many examples of her going above and beyond. Thank you!

I can't say enough about my AMAZING experience with Lace and Bustle. I'll start off by saying, that Lace and Bustle was the very first and only bridal boutique I visited. I'm usual...

ly very picky when it comes to clothing, so I was honestly just dreading having to shop for wedding dresses. I was scared that I would not be able to find anything that I liked. My experience ended up being the complete opposite. The ladies at Lace and Bustle really listened to what I was looking for and made me feel comfortable, relaxed, and made the experience so much fun. I think we all knew when I tried on THE dress that it was the one. The ladies at Lace and Bustle hyped me up and topped off my look with a gorgeous veil. Let me add that they did NOT at all make me feel pressure to say yes to the dress, they instead held my hand through the entire experience. Not only did they help me find the dress of my dreams, but once my dress was ready, Victoria hand delivered it to the tailor that she recommended. She stayed during my appointment with the tailor and made sure that everything was perfect. I LOVE Victoria. To all you beautiful brides looking for the dress of your dreams, look no further! Thank you Lace and Bustle, for everything.

This was the last store I had planned to visit while wedding dress shop while my mom was in town and we almost skipped it since it's a little off the beaten path, but totally worth...

the visit! The store is beautiful and the dress collection is the best I saw. They have modern, yet timeless options. I love how the dresses are all displaced for perusing. The owner, Victoria, was so genuine and helpful. I am SO happy with my gown and cannot wait to show it off. I am grateful to Victoria and her staff for making wedding dress shopping a truly unforgettable experience. On a side note, the tailor she recommends is also amazing :)

As a new bride, I was anxious to start looking for my perfect wedding dress! In February 2018, I set up 3 appointments in Walnut Creek to find my perfect dress! Lace & bustle was m...

y last stop and when I walked into the store, it was a breath of fresh air! They were so kind & welcoming! They had all the dresses and more that I had sent to them lined up and ready to try on. Victoria and all the ladies were especially fantastic in helping me get into my dress and entertaining all my family & friends. I tried on my second dress and that was the ONE. We cheered with champagne, it was a magical moment. After ordering the gown, the next day I realized that I had an extra alteration that I wanted to be made. They took so much care of me, and got right on it!As of now, we are half way through the dress process. Victoria, sent me a recent update of my dress and asked all the right questions, listened to my concerns! She was emailing me back at 10:30 at night with updates, I mean, come on, how fantastic is that for a bride to be!!! My dress is still in alterations, but I feel safe knowing that Victoria and the other ladies are helping me to create my perfect dress for my wedding day! If you want a fantastic dress spot for incredible gowns and great customer service, go to Lace & Bustle!!! xoxo Madison E.

Victoria was so amazing and pleasant to work with! This was the first boutique and first wedding dress I ever tried on and I knew it was the "one" as soon as I put it on. I didn't...

I cannot say enough good things about Lace and bustle bridal, Victoria and her mom. This boutique is every brides dream! You have got to set an appointment with them like right now...

! I called L&B to see if they had my dream dress. Even though, the store did not carry the dress, they offered to order it for me from New York to try it on. The dress came a week later and I went to L&B knowing that maybe my dream dress would not be the right fit and that it was out of budget. I had tried dresses in at least 5 other stores small and big such as David's bridal, BHLDN and Nordstrom, but the bridal experience was lacking and part of wedding dress shopping is experiencing that perfect bridal shopping experience. From the moment I arrived at L&B, I had stepped into my fantasy bridal experience! They were waiting for me. I didn't have to wait in line. Victoria helped me and let me just tell you, Victoria is such a wonderful and genuinely sweet human being! She's just so great! And the boutique! It has this gorgeous look from inside and outside. I love all the beautiful details it has and I love the customer service experience I had there. My sister and I were offered tea every time we visited! When I entered the store, I was directed to a fitting room where there was a beautiful robe waiting for me to step into, and there it was, my dream dress. I tried multiple dresses to compare and contrast similar dresses. I was indecisive, and Victoria was so patient, always providing input on what looked good and listening to what I wanted. Although I did not buy my dress on the spot, when my appointment was over, I whispered to my sister, "I don't think I need to go to any other stores. I'll cancel my other appointments" Everything felt so right about my experience there. It was everything I had dreamt of! The dress was more beautiful than I imagined, but the price was a bit high, and I wanted some customization done to the dress, so I discussed it with Victoria and we came up with a plan which worked for me and my fiancé. When I finally said yes to the dress Victoria even brought out a champagne for a toast! When my dress arrived she also helped me pick the perfect veil to match my dress and provided input about what would look good. Victoria even set up my appointment with the tailor to get my dress fitted, and the tailor she recommends is another great human being (but that's for another review). And get this, the day of my first appointment with the tailor, I missed my appointment because I had the wrong time in my mind, so I called Victoria panicking, and she was so sweet! She contacted the tailor and got him to see me later. She is super responsive, she's an expert, and she goes above and beyond for her brides. If you want to have beautiful memories of your bridal gown shopping experience, I assure you L&B will help you create memories to cherish for the rest of your life. I am grateful to have found them because my experience with them was one of my favorite parts of wedding planning. L&B you are seriously the best! I definitely recommend them 100% to all my friends and to all the brides out there. They're seriously the best!

This was my first stop and I knew I had the dress 10 minutes after I walked in. It was the first dress Victoria recommended after I described what I was looking. BUT I tried it on ...

last. I also wanted to see what Victoria would suggest. And she really knew what to ask to get me comfortable and to describe what I was looking. I was really nervous and a clueless bride. I really wanted her to lead the selections. I felt like she really listened to me. And when I tried on THE DRESS she was able to read my face. And knew it was the ONE. She also gave great advice to do a second viewing and to bring shoes. In my head, the process was too quick and she picked up on that. But second viewing, same reaction. It was THE ONE. She also provides a great seamstress, Joseph. He is amazing and down the street from the bridal shop. Victoria came to the first fitting to make the introductions. Everything was really easy and simple. HIGHLY RECOMMEND going Lace and Bustle. She has a lot of styles. There was need or is a need to go to the city for dress shopping.

roughout the entire process. When I made my online appointment, Victoria, the owner, called me to personally congratulate me on my engagement and asked if I could send her pictures of dresses I like from my Pinterest Board so she could have some dresses waiting for me at my appointment. I thought this was such a thoughtful gesture and made me really excited about my visit. When I got to the shop, everything was perfect! Victoria was so welcoming, the decorations in the shop were super cute and everything was very professional! Nikki was my amazing stylist who spent over 2 hours helping me try on dresses, checking in to see how I was doing, and helping me to decide which styles I liked and didn't. She did a wonderful job making me feel comfortable in all the dresses (and getting in and out of the dresses) and was so thorough when explaining all the different details of each dress. In the end, I said "YES" to the first dress I tried on! I was happy crying with my mom and sister and Nikki was right there to hug it out! I would recommend Lace & Bustle to anyone and EVERYONE! My experience with them as been my favorite part of wedding planning so far!

I have been to many bridal salons from Maryland to California over the last 10 months of searching for the dress and accessories and by far, Lace & Bustle is my favorite. The salon...

is the perfect size where you do not feel overwhelmed, but you still feel like you have all the options you need. I first learned about Lace & Bustle from the monthly planning email from The Knot. I sent a request through the website with what I was looking for and heard back the next morning with availability. On the day of the appointment I had to reschedule as that was during the fires up here in the valley and my bridal party flights were delayed by over 4 hours. Nikki and Sierra were very accommodating to the change and very gracious when we could arrive. When I arrived at the salon, Nikki already had a silhouette dress (similar to mine) available for me to try and had several of the lace jackets staged and waiting for me. I truly felt that they had listened to what I was looking for and were expecting me. During the appointment Nikki and Sierra were very patient and accommodating with the multiple opinions from my bridal party and the endless photos. They truly made it a great experience for all of us. I told Nikki that I would tell all of our Auberge brides about Lace & Bustle. Since the first appointment it has been seamless communication, regardless of who is responding to the emails. It is nice to know that all 3 of you are on the same page and I do not need to restart the full conversation each time with a new person. My visit this weekend was just as wonderful as my first visit. Thank you for your time and commitment to helping me find the perfect lace jacket for my wedding. You truly make me feel like the only bride in the world.

he perfect wedding look. I had tried on 5-6 dresses here, but did not fall in love. She suggested I try some bridal separates which didn't even cross my mind. I fell head over heels in love with a dusty blue Jaclyn Jordan skirt, but did not find the top of my dreams. I searched far and wide and still nothing. I thought I'd have to settle for a dress until I got a call from Victoria sating she had some Lea Ann Belter tops for one weekend only, the thing was I was going to be in Seattle that weekend. She went above and beyond and stayed late one day just for me to try them on and of course, I found the top of my dreams! I cannot say enough about Lace & Bustle and would recommend them a million times over.

gem was here when I first looked at dresses, and I needed to get a rush on a dress (2 months out from wedding, other dress from another place fell through...I was kind of a stress case) and she totally put me at ease and immediately called around and found me a beautiful dress that could be made in time - she made me feel like even though I was under a huge time crunch, that I could still get what I wanted and didn't have to compromise! Victoria and her staff are extremely knowledgeable and go out of their way to make sure the day feels fun and special. The store itself is freaking adorable too, and the QUALITY of the gowns is just amazing. I'm telling everyone I know about this shop!

pointment. Victoria was so friendly and kind to take me. She asked what I was looking for and as I described what I wanted she said she had literally just ordered a dress that had every detail I was looking for! It was amazing! I still browsed all of her dresses in store. They are all stunning with gorgeous details everywhere you look. I came back when the dress she ordered came in and BOOM that was my dress!! It was fate!! Honest to God Victoria was born to own a wedding dress shop. She is beautiful inside and out and is one of the most kindhearted people that I have ever met. Her kindness is contagious and makes you feel so welcome. I am so honored that I got the opportunity to be an L&B bride and work with her. She handled every detail perfectly, she measured me so well that when my dress came the ONLY alteration needed was the bustle!!! Victoria has an eye for everything elegant and timeless. You cannot go wrong with a dress or even bridal accessory from L&B. Her store is so beautiful I want to pop in there even after my wedding is over!

g. Here is an excerpt from a letter I wrote to Victoria after purchasing my dress that sums up my experience: "I'm so incredibly excited to have found my wedding dress! I feel so beautiful, and it is truly the dress of my dreams. I also wanted to share with you that my mom and I specifically came back to your bridal salon because of our experience in February. We were completely awestruck by your beautiful salon and stunning dresses. But most of all we were blown away by you! Your expertise, passion for dressing brides, and warm, compassionate demeanor sealed the deal for us. I was so at ease on Sunday not only because I knew it was my dress but because I felt so confident and comfortable in your hands." Make and appointment to see Victoria you won't be disappointed. :-)

me into any particular dress. I had a hard time deciding between two dresses and they had me come back in and try them both on again. I ended up with a beautiful blush ballgown that I still wish I could wear every day. Victoria also recommended an alteration place and came with my mom and I the first time to make sure all the details were taken care of. I just want to Thank Victoria so much for everything she did, encouraging me to go with my gut, helping me get the dress and veil and being patient with me through the whole process. I couldn't be happier with dress I picked. I recommend Lace and Bustle as a must stop shop for your wedding dress.

ure I felt beautiful, valued, and not rushed. She clearly is in this business because she has a passion for helping brides find their perfect dress, and she makes you feel so special. I came to Lace and Bustle after a series of disappointing appointments where I left empty handed, and felt like the customer service lacked. When I came into Lace and Bustle, I didn't even have an appointment. But, Victoria treated me with more respect and generosity than the employees at the other places where I had an appointment. Lace and Bustle had such a gorgeous selection of dresses, but there was one particular dress that caught my eye. Victoria insisted I try it on even though I didn't have an appointment. I am so glad I tried the dress on, because it ended up being "The One." Victoria was amazing throughout the entire process from finding the dress, to making sure every detail was in place before she ordered it, to keeping in touch with me and responding to my emails in a timely fashion. She always keeps me up to date. My dress came in today, and it is PERFECT. Lace and Bustle has it all! Customer service, a gorgeous selection of dresses, a romantic and beautiful atmosphere, and the price range is sure to accommodate any budget. Anyone who is searching for the perfect dress, and overall experience, you will not be disappointed if you come here! Thank you so much Lace and Bustle. I am so glad I found you.

Lace and Bustle Bridal was my wedding dress savior! And when I say that, I truly mean they saved me from a dress disaster. My wedding dress story is one from hell that I wish upon ...

no bride. Luckily it has a happy ending and all because of Victoria. 6 weeks before my wedding while looking for wedding jewelry in Lafayette, I stumbled into Lace and Bustle. Victoria kindly greeted me with a smile and welcomed me into their store. I asked if they had any belts and she said yes and showed them to me. I told her my dress was a lace mermaid style (not telling her it was currently in an alterations nightmare) and she pulled a dress from her rack that was similar so I could try it on with the belt. When I came out the dressing room, in this new dress, I felt like a BRIDE again. A feeling I hadn’t felt in my current dress in a long time. I kindly took off the dress and belt and thanked Victoria and left. When I got to my car I sat there for some time and something told me to go back. As I entered her store again I was a ball of tears and I told Victoria my story. I told her I didn’t know what to do as my alterations has been paid in full, my dress was a mess and my wedding was 6 weeks away. She poured me a glass of champagne and told me she had an idea. She called her tailor Joseph and told him that she had a bride with an emergency. They both told me to go pick up my dress and don't let them do any more work to it. So 6 weeks before my wedding, I picked up my dress, mid-alterations hoping for a miracle. Talk about mental breakdown! Victoria helped me remain optimistic and we had many conversations about options. I asked her about a backup plan, a "just in case." She reassured me that everything would work itself out and promised to start looking for my back up dress. She contacted the assistant of the designer Matthew Christopher who had made the dress I had tried on in her store to see what dresses they had on hand and ready to ship. Victoria emailed me the following day and told me they found a dress, in my size that was available and ready to ship. For the first time I had hope! A few days later I tried on the sample dress that Victoria could order for me. It was very similar to my old dress but different, a fresh start. I smiled and told Victoria "I'm saying yes to a new dress!" As promised the dress arrived in 1 week and it was perfect! Victoria is amazing to her brides! She's passionate, kind and genuine. Your wedding dress is probably the biggest part of your wedding day (aside from saying “I do” to your hubby or wifey). Your wedding dress adventure should be magical and fun. You should feel beautiful and comfortable in your dress and Victoria will help you achieve this. She doesn’t have an ulterior motive; she doesn’t want to take your money or lie to get your business. She wants to be a part of your wedding dream and make it memorable. In the end, yes I was left with 2 wedding dresses which I look back and laugh about, but I walked down the aisle in the dress that I felt beautiful in and I have Victoria to thank for that! She saved me from my horrific wedding dress nightmare and did it out of the kindness of her heart. My only regret was that I didn't stumble into her gem of a store sooner. She brought the sparkle back into my eyes and because of her and Joseph I felt absolutely beautiful on my wedding day. Thank you Lace and Bustle Bridal. I am forever grateful!

which gowns to pull. Their boutique is absolutely adorable. It is so wedding, so cute, so bridal. Everything is so thoughtfully picked and placed. A personal touch. A bridal touch. A L&B touch. It was if I entered a dream that I didn't want to leave. Pure perfection. After leaving my personalized and attentive appointment, I could not stop thinking about my soon-to-be gown and the "superb-ness" that I just experienced. I emailed Victoria about 4 hours later about coming in the next day to make it official. If a 10 star customer service rating existed, Lace & Bustle would be an 11! They are super resourceful, kind, organized (which is a biggy for me) and genuine. Such a joy! I am so fortunate to be an L&B bride!!!

would make your wedding dress experience light and airy. This website does not even have that many stars Lace and Bustles deserves! And where do I begin? After a few Bridal salons in San Francisco and Bay Area we made a trip to a gorgeous and magical bridal boutique Lace and Bustles. Everything started by me explaining Victoria what we were looking for and immediately she said: "You girls gotta come to my salon and I have exactly what you are looking for." From the moment we walked into the salon, my sister and I were just swept away from our feet with an exquisite wedding dresses collection and accessories. Victoria greeted us and made us so comfortable and at ease. The wedding dresses were all amazingly gorgeous and absolutely fabulous. Victoria knows exactly what every bride wants and provides an amazing service. If you are looking for a wedding dress, Lace and Bustles should be your definite destination. Her salon is just spectacular and magical in every way. Every dress I tried on looked absolutely stunning and unique on and it was such a difficult choice for us to pick that one that we really loved (we loved all of them I tried on). The boutique has wedding dresses displayed in windows and you feel like you are in a fairytale going to the palace ball. Lace and Bustles boutique makes every girl's dream come to life to be a stunning bride on her special day!
