As far as in-season flowers for January go, your options are a touch more limited. Though, that doesn't mean these blossoms are any less vibrant or worthy of your celebration. Get some inspo from these flowers in season in January for a wedding. (And refer to the flower chart by month above to see what they look like.) 

### Anemone

Known for its distinctive black center, the anemone brings a modern vibe to any arrangement. These blooms come in all sorts of fun colors (red and white are the most popular), but January marriers should consider the fuschia anemone coronaria, known for adding a vibrant pop to the muted winter landscape. Slot these anemones into everything from simple bud-vase centerpieces to garden-style [anemone bouquets](https://www.theknot.com/content/anemone-bouquet).

FEATURED VIDEO FROM THE KNOT

### Iris

Flowers that bloom from bulbs are typically associated with spring, but the architectural iris can "spring" up through the snow. In some areas, this is one of the primary flowers in season for January. The winter iris in particular is a variety you'll find available, which has mid-tone purple petals with pops of yellow. 

### Freesia

In certain USDA Hardiness Zones (and if grown indoors in a pot), freesia can be a January bloom. This flower is known for its perfumey fragrance and is made up of subtle, snow-white petals with a kiss of yellow at their base (but they can also come in other colors). Freesia a wonderful addition to a winter bouquet. 

## In-Season February Wedding Flowers

![Collage of flowers that are in season for a February wedding. ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/654c6db0-1425-43d5-b6a5-adeeb9722963~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1500.1125)

_Design: Tiana Crispino_

We often think of red and pink roses during the month of love. And though they're easily sourced from warmer climates in February ([wedding tariffs](https://www.theknot.com/content/financial-anxiety) notwithstanding), try embracing some true flowers in season in February.

### Ranunculus

What flowers are in season in February? These beloved blooms. Distinguished by their tightly packed petal pattern, ranunculus look great alongside roses and greenery. [Ranunculus wedding bouquets](https://www.theknot.com/content/ranunculus-wedding-bouquets) are especially whimsical and cheerful, so we consider this flower one of the stars of the February flower season.

### Waxflower

Waxflower is a hearty bloom that can stand up to cold winter temperatures. The petite flower works especially well in boutonnieres. Plus, waxflowers are known for being rather inexpensive, so couples hunting for [affordable wedding flowers](https://www.theknot.com/content/top-ten-inexpensive-flowers) should keep them top of mind. 

### Clematis

Star-shaped clematis look equal parts funky and romantic. And clematis cirrhosa is one of the coolest flowers that are in season in February. The bloom has a spindly, pale-green center and white petals freckled with magenta, which look like winter berries against February snow. 

## In-Season March Wedding Flowers

![Collage of flowers that are in season for a March wedding. ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/a63b1cbd-e5d3-41b0-99b4-fe9e70e76fbc~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1500.1125)

_Design: Tiana Crispino_

March is the month where most of the US sees the first signs of spring, with pops of color emerging from the winter brush. While they aren't the most [popular types of wedding flowers](https://www.theknot.com/content/top-10-wedding-flowers), March blooms bring to mind the scent of fresh dew and the sound of birds chirping. Early-spring nuptials? Kind of a vibe. 

### Tulip

Tulips are a classic late winter and early-spring flower. One of the most iconic flowers in season in March, they bring an elegant, refined feel to wedding arrangements, like centerpieces and [tulip bouquets](https://www.theknot.com/content/tulip-bouquet-ideas). Tulips come in shades that span from vibrant yellow to pastel pink. 

### Daffodil

Daffodils are the happiest blossoms of all the flowers in bloom in March, with their sunburst-shaped petals and bell-like centers. Available in bright yellows, golden oranges and soft whites, you'll surely get some smiles from your wedding guests once they spot a few daffodils on your day. Mix them with fronds of greenery to soften their bold shape. 

### Find your kind of venue

From barns to ballrooms, discover reception venues that feel like you.

### Snowdrop

One of the most enchanting options in this list of seasonal flowers by month, delicate snowdrops are a must for small bouquets (one of the [latest wedding flower trends](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-flower-trends)). These tiny white flowers look like something a fairy might wear as a skirt. (How lovely would they be for an enchanted-forest wedding in March?) 

## In-Season April Wedding Flowers

![Collage of flowers that are in season for an April wedding. ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/38d72ca3-8a64-4c92-ba86-f75e706c63c1~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1500.1125)

_Design: Tiana Crispino_

If you're wondering what flowers are in season in April, you'll be met with the most delicate blossoms imaginable. Pops of pink begin to become commonplace during this month, as do soft petals. April couples, we're so excited for you. 

### Lily of the Valley

If you've been eying this teeny, bell-shaped bloom since Kate Middleton carried it during her nuptials, you're in luck. Lily of the valley is one of the best April flowers for a wedding; it's elegant, subtle and classic. Since it is rather fragile, its price typically clocks in above what the [average wedding flower costs](https://www.theknot.com/content/average-cost-wedding-flowers). (PS: [The Knot Budget Advisor](https://www.theknot.com/our-wedding-budget) can help give you an idea of how much you should allocate for florals.) 

### Hyacinth

Similar in shape to a lilac, hyacinth (which can be white, pink or purple) works well in spring centerpieces that benefit from the plant's tall stature. Hyacinth is made up of many small blooms clustered together and is one of the top April wedding flowers in season to consider if you'd like to add some height to your arrangements. 

### Sweet Pea

This delicate wedding flower smells great and looks amazing, and it's most readily available for couples tying the knot in late winter or early spring. Sweet pea comes in every hue from blush pink to deep purple, with some blossoms showing off multiple tones in this range. 

## In-Season May Wedding Flowers

![Collage of flowers that are in season for a May wedding.](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/ab1b12c4-0b84-48f0-8ba6-a77815286a57~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1500.1125)

_Design: Tiana Crispino_

The flowers in season in May include some beloved wedding varieties. Think: big, fluffy blossoms that feel unequivocally romantic. And the smell of these blooms? Intoxicating in the best way. 

### Peony

Peonies are adored by many to-be-weds, but because they have a relatively short growing season, they're one of the most in-demand May flowers in season. If you're able to use this lush flower for a [peony wedding bouquet](https://www.theknot.com/content/peony-wedding-bouquet) or other arrangement, consider yourself one of the lucky mid-spring couples.

### Hydrangea

Great for large-scale installations at weddings, hydrangeas are at their peak before seasonal temperatures get hot and cause them to wilt. For [hydrangea wedding bouquets](https://www.theknot.com/content/hydrangeas-wedding-bouquets) and centerpieces, your florist will have some tricks up their sleeve to keep the blooms hydrated.

### Lilac

What flowers are in season in May? This quintessential spring flower. Lilacs are a great option for [bouquets](https://www.theknot.com/content/lilac-wedding-bouquets) and arrangements with pops of purple. Not to mention: the beautiful, aromatic fragrance.

## In-Season June Wedding Flowers

![Collage of flowers that are in season for a June wedding.](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/cd4c45d6-b42c-492b-b1f5-9cf64e752fc7~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1500.1125)

_Design: Tiana Crispino_

The flowers in bloom in June for a wedding are some of the most iconic, including the rose. June blooms are beloved all year, but it's always a nice feeling to know the flowers you love are in their prime.

FOR YOU

### Rose

Roses can be procured almost anywhere during any time of the year, but [rose bouquets](https://www.theknot.com/content/rose-wedding-bouquet) and centerpieces look especially great at June weddings. Since June is a transitional time as late spring gives way to early summer, some strictly spring or summer flowers are hard to come by. Not only is the rose one of the best June wedding flowers, but it's a timeless standby that works in any wedding aesthetic.

### Delphinium (Larkspur)

Delphinium, also known as larkspur, looks similar in nature to Bells-of-Ireland or stock. Delphinium are great flowers in season for a June wedding if you're on the hunt for a long stem to work as ceremony aisle flowers or statement arches because of the height they bring to arrangements.

### Gardenia

Gardenias are especially fragrant flowers, so care should be taken when deciding to incorporate them into boutonnieres or carrying a [gardenia wedding bouquet](https://www.theknot.com/content/gardenia-wedding-bouquet), since some people may have sensitivities to their smell. Nevertheless, this June flower is a beautiful option for romantic and elegant occasions.

## In-Season July Wedding Flowers

![Collage of flowers that are in season for a July wedding. ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/845f4d6b-762b-47ef-9782-d04e5afb0e74~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1500.1125)

_Design: Tiana Crispino_

July flowers in bloom feel as bright and fun as the month itself. This time of year is also when flowers start to get funky, with unique, tropical shapes emerging. 

### Lisianthus

A lisianthus can sometimes be mistaken for a rose, but the bloom is identifiable by the green stamen in the middle. One of the smaller July flowers in bloom, lisianthus are generally more petite than roses, so they work well as a boutonniere flower at early summer weddings.

### Calla Lily

Calla lilies are great flowers in bloom in July to use for weddings. They're an especially popular option for [bouquets](https://www.theknot.com/content/lily-wedding-bouquets) and boutonnieres. The sleek, long-stemmed botanical blends nicely into glam-themed weddings.

### Gerbera Daisy

Gerbera daisies, along with other daisy varieties, are a solid option for summer backyard weddings. They come in a variety of bright-and-juicy colors perfect for a summer celebration. They're some of the cheeriest flowers in season in July for weddings.

## In-Season August Wedding Flowers

![Collage of flowers that are in season for an August wedding. ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/f5f6c969-9310-4259-872e-b7c8bca84634~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1500.1125)

_Design: Tiana Crispino_

With August, come architectural and otherworldly blooms in vibrant hues. These August flowers in season are sure to make a wedding statement. 

### Zinnia

The growing season for zinnias lasts from late spring through early fall, but the vibrant flowers are generally at their peak in late summer. These flowers are in season in August and are great options for weddings. They catch the eye with thickly packed layers of small petals that give them an almost ruffled look.

### Cosmos

For couples who like petite, wildflower-style blooms, cosmos are a great option. These August wedding flowers have narrow stems and come in a variety of colors, from white to bright orange, yellow, pink, red and purple.

### Allium

These alien-like flowers primarily appear as purple pom-poms. Composed of star-shaped, tiny flowers tightly clustered together, texture is a major focal point for these special blooms. Bonus: They are known to attract butterflies, if you don't mind some winged guests. 

## In-Season September Wedding Flowers

![Collage of flowers that are in season for a September wedding. ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/16fb5d43-82c0-4d9f-acdf-14253df36241~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1500.1125)

_Design: Tiana Crispino_

Whether late summer or early fall is more your vibe, you'll find a blossom that suits your style amongst the seasonal flowers blooming in September. We start to get into more muted, yet still-rich tones during this month. 

### Dahlia

Dahlias are like the peonies of fall (and one of the most popular flowers in season in September). Both blooms are highly sought after by couples, but only available for very short periods of time. If you're tying the knot in September, consider a gorgeous [dahlia wedding bouquet](https://www.theknot.com/content/dahlia-wedding-bouquet) or seasonal centerpiece with foliage and greenery.

### Marigold

Especially popular as decor for [Indian weddings](https://www.theknot.com/content/indian-wedding-planning), marigolds also work well when strung into garlands for backdrops and installations at late-summer and early-fall weddings. Other than the distinct orange color, these lovely September flowers for a wedding bloom in yellow, red and brown tones.

### Butterfly Bush

Another bloom on this list that's popular with pollinators, butterfly bush should be on your radar if you're wondering what flowers are in season in September. Think of the botanical as early fall's answer to spring lilacs, save with a tighter bloom pattern and deeper purple hue more suitable for the cusp of the chilly season. These florals would be lovely September flowers for a wedding bouquet if you're open to a slightly wild, romantic silhouette. 

## In-Season October Wedding Flowers

![Collage of flowers that are in season for an October wedding.](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/58d240ca-1d37-44af-b602-fc54937991c2~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1500.1125)

_Design: Tiana Crispino_

Flowers in season in October definitely lean into the rich, autumnal tones you'd expect from this rustic-and-cozy month. Many of October's flowers in season feature slender, tightly-packed petals, creating some super-textural arrangements for marriers tying the knot during this month. 

### Celosia (Cockscomb)

Celosia can take on two styles—it generally either resembles sea coral, growing in rounded bunches, or takes on a feather-like quality, growing up into tapered points. But no matter which form it takes, celosia blooms in a vibrant variety of jewel-toned colorways, making it a popular choice of the October wedding flowers in season.

### Chrysanthemum

Chrysanthemums show a similar petal structure to dahlias, but tend to be a more budget-friendly counterpart. Part of the daisy family, these flowers can take shape in small, all-petal blooms or in more architectural, octopus-like blossoms. 

### Aster

Asters have needle-thin purple petals clustered around a bright yellow center. They are wonderful wedding flowers in season in October for couples going for a wildflower look, as their wispy petals and small size are easy to envision swaying gently in a fall field. 

## In-Season November Wedding Flowers

![Collage of flowers that are in season for a November wedding. ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/dbdbfc11-1336-4d99-9a41-3c7114f61242~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1500.1125)

_Design: Tiana Crispino_

The slate of seasonal flowers for November starts to skew toward berries and branches in addition to your classic flowers, making for some seriously eye-catching and structural arrangements. Though, rest assured, you can still find plenty of rich color during this month. 

### Camellia

Camellias resemble a cross between garden roses and dahlias, making them a good option for the times of year when dahlias are hard to come by. Their petal shape sits somewhere in between the two beloved blossoms, displaying the pointed tips of the dahlia and rounded edges of the rose. 

### Amaranthus

Vine-like amaranthus is one of the few flowers that hangs down and doesn't stand up, making it a good option for [cascading bouquets](https://www.theknot.com/content/cascading-wedding-bouquet-ideas). This blossom is a huge burgeoning trend, thanks to its surrealist shape and texture. A must of the November seasonal flowers for out-of-the-box duos getting hitched in this month. 

### Privet Berry

Privet berries almost look like tiny, dark-purple grapes, with densely packed clusters of berries sprouting from delicate branches. This is a great in-season flower for a November wedding, since it'll add plenty of autumnal and early-winter texture. 

## In-Season December Wedding Flowers

![Collage of flowers that are in season for a December wedding. ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/64f0b34b-f188-4927-a712-bf74e8a389cd~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1500.1125)

_Design: Tiana Crispino_

Yes, a few flakes of frost have likely already fallen ahead of December couples' nuptials, but there are still some stunning flowers that are in season in December to consider. Whether you're hosting a holiday wedding or not, give these unique blossoms a shot. 

### Amaryllis

This vibrant red bloom is one of the most quintessential flowers in season in Deceber. While it would look good at a [Christmas wedding](https://www.theknot.com/content/christmas-wedding-ideas), we also love the option of using amaryllis as a January wedding flower too.

### Pointsettia

Another emblematic holiday plant, a poinsettia has unique, leaf-like petals. They make great in-season flowers for a December wedding, showing off hues like ivory, pale pink and, of course, rich red. 

### Hellebore

Hellebore looks great in boho arrangements because of the flower's dusty greenish-purple appearance that almost resembles eucalyptus. The petite nature of this in-season flower for a December wedding also makes it a great boutonniere choice.
