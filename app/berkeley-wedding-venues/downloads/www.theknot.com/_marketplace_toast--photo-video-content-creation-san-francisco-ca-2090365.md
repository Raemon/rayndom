He was also so energetic and down with our families, craziness and fun vibes. I would definitely do toast again if we renewed our vows in the future. Not only do they work well with you and have great communication but the footage and videos and photos you get, a couple days after the wedding by the way, are so great. Fast, fun, efficient, kind, and caring. Great vibes!!! Thank you Toast!!!!

Chris did an awesome job of capturing everything we wanted on the day of the wedding and we did not feel overwhelmed with the presence of camera crew. After the wedding we went through a few edits and Zach was always very attentive and made sure we got what we wanted. We are very happy with the end result and would highly recommend Toast Wedding Films to other couples looking to capture their special day!
