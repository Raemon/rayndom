GHLY suggest using their recommended vendors and taking advantage of any discounts they offer. Our guests really enjoyed their catered food and their florist and bakery did an amazing job! Our one critique is that we wish they were more clear in the beginning on additional costs to ceremony and reception decor that could appear to be included when looking at the photos or touring the venue. Overall, our experience was wonderful with them and we do not regret going with Jefferson Street Mansion by Wedgewood Weddings.

We stuck to the planning timeline they provided in the planning binder (which was SO helpful to have) and had everything ready in time. Our guests all raved about what a fabulous wedding it was. We customized the venue quite a bit bringing in our own decor and personal touches and it did not feel cookie-cutter at all even though it is an all-inclusive venue. I am so happy we chose JSM!! The recommended vendors were all outstanding, the food was delicious, everything ran smoothly during the wedding and I didn't have to stress about a thing. The mansion, ceremony area, and reception tent are all BEAUTIFUL. I could not have asked for a more perfect day.

experience any worries, we were in the best hands and felt so comfortable and so cared for in every detail. Our guests had a wonderful time and we've had so much sweet feedback of how beautiful the venue was and how seamless it all appeared. The top-notch professionalism, the choreography, the eagerness to make it all smooth for us, the attention to detail, the service level -- every bit was amazing. We used their preferred vendors which made it way more affordable and every service and product was excellent - the Food, our Florist, our Cake, our DJ, our Photographer. Value for what you spend is Very Very Good. Would recommend them to anyone looking for an Elegant setting, good value for dollar, and lots of help planning and executing! A+

ther things we wanted to add. Choosing Wedgewood Weddings was so great. My husband and I had a blast at the wedding because they were so attentive to everything. The only "problem" we had was that we didn't get to use the ceremony site due to the rain (because obviously they cannot control that). But the staff at Wedgewood did such an AMAZING job setting everything up in the reception area that it did not take away from the wedding. Due to the rain we got to utilize the mansion more then I thought we would and I loved it. My friends and family all thought it was a great wedding and my husband and I had a memorable and amazing time.

m the very start. I really am grateful with them for answering all my questions via email and phone calls, even text. On the day of, everything went perfectly, they checked in with our wedding party, kept us on our timeline, made me laugh when I was visibly nervous before walking down the aisle, fixed my dress train before we walked down, everything they did that day made me feel cared for and the Jefferson Team really felt like a big extended family. Lastly I did use a personal photographer and the Jefferson Team was very flexible in letting her come and check out the venue, even my dad came to visit once to see this place because we had chosen our venue without our family at the time, I also ended up leaving my heels after the wedding and they held it for me until I picked them up. It may not sound like a lot but their flexibility and understanding meant so much to me and everyone in my family. I can not express how grateful I am and will ever be for this team, and I 1000% recommend them. If you are looking for a smooth planning process, a caring team, a beautiful venue, and great vendor partnerships this is the place to go to. P.S I recommend all the favorite foods from their venue it was SO DELICIOUS!

As we got closer to the wedding, it really seemed like she cared about us and our special day. Demika was our banquet captain on the day of the wedding. She took care of our every need, built us up, and joined the party. If you get married at a Wedgewood venue, you'll benefit from an extremely well-designed and well-organized system of planners, facilities, coordinators, and relationships with preferred vendors. It made my husband and my experience so much easier than it otherwise could have been. Jefferson Street Mansion is beautiful and delightful. If you live in the Bay, it feels both local and like an escape. We loved everything about the experience.

us make the best out a bad situation and since the venue is all inclusive we had no trouble rebooking all the vendors for a different day. Getting closer to the big day we had a distract drop in guests than we had initially predicted. Our coordinator did every thing that she could so that we would meet our minimum and honestly it turned out a million times better than I initially envisioned. They definitely have things down to a science there - all of our vendors were absolutely wonderful and I can’t recommend them enough!

We first booked this venue in January of 2020 because everything was inclusive and it was a beautiful location. Then COVID happened and we were worried about losing our money. Not ...

only did the Wedgewood employees work with us to choose a new date, but they also helped us have piece of mind by giving us some of our money back. They kept our original deposit, but gave us our second payment back in case covid closures didn’t allow gatherings for an extended amount of time. Once things opened up again, our plans moved forward. Everything is included with this venue and they do so much to help you plan and prepare. We had several meetings to work out the details which made planning so nice and easy. Meeting with the cake, floral, and officiant vendors was also a pleasant experience. Over all, we highly recommend Jefferson St. Mansion. On the day of our wedding, everything was absolutely perfect and just the way we had imaged it. The ceremony and reception sites were so stunning and my guests wouldn’t stop talking about how beautiful the venue was, how good the food was, and over all, what a blast they were having at our party.

We had a great experience with our wedding at the JSM! Obviously, the place is beautiful, but what really stood out was the people. For my previous wedding there were a lot of ru...

les and restrictions for using the property that prevented me from booking the location. A lot of the restrictions were removed when Wedgewood took over the planning for events at the space and it made the experience a lot more enjoyable. Our DoC was Mariana, who took over after our previous contact transitioned to a new position, and she did a fabulous job with everything. Everything went well the day of. The planning/meetings prior were very detailed and helpful. When we had trouble getting a hold of a particular vendor they were helpful in coordinating communication between us and them. Valarie with A Love in Bloom was amazing. We could only hope to find her on our own for a wedding elsewhere if we were not already introduced through JSM. Brian Lansang was our DJ from iMobileDJ the packages DJ, I would not have hired a different DJ for anything. They were on point during the ceremony and on top of everything for the reception. Contact with Brian ahead of the meeting was easy and fluid, they were very responsive. Sue from Officially Yours was wonderful with the ceremony planning and execution. She was so sweet and kind that it made everything a little easier. My husband spent some time talking to the servers and bartenders after things were winding down and he was really impressed with how friendly and responsive they were.

. From the moment we stepped on the property we know it was the one & it had everything we needed. It was all inclusive so it made planning really easy and worry free. Along with that, we had the best wedding coordination, from genuine people who care and actually love what they do. Everything was executed to the T & our guests loved and continue to talk about it 4 months down. Thank you Jefferson Street Mansion for allowing us to have the best wedding ever and for allowing our love to shine on such an important day!

We celebrated our wedding on October 5th. The entire process, from first meeting to leaving the venue after our reception, was absolutely perfect. At our first meeting, we met wi...

th Kristen, and knew that we had found the wedding coordinator of our dreams. She listened to every request, question, comment, concern, etc., and always made us feel like her most important client. Since our wedding, we've heard back from so many guests that it was the "best wedding ever, the venue is amazing, the food was beyond fantastic," and on and on. So many compliments. Let me give a shout-out to the best team of vendors we could have hoped for: RANDY at the bar, you are amazing! FABIOLA at the bar, we think you're awesome! ALIEAH, we love you and appreciate you so much!! JACOB, our captain, thank you so much! You handled everything so brilliantly, long into the night! NICOLE, you rock, and you are a bright light at Wedgewood! NOEL ,for the photo booth, we are so grateful! VALARIE, from A Love's In Bloom, the flowers exceeded every expectation! JOHN at SWEET SPRINGS, everyone loved your Espresso! A couple of special mentions... BRIAN from iMobileDJ's, we love you and thank you so much for the crowd management, the finesse you put on just about everything, and the music you mixed, spun, whirled, and twirled! KAREN from Old Town Danville Bakery, we are so grateful we got to know you, and you made our cake and dessert table positively legendary. People are still talking about it. We adore you, we really do! KRISTEN, you are beyond amazing, talented, so capable of anticipating every need we had that night, and you did all of it with a smile. We appreciate you beyond measure. I would not hesitate to recommend this venue to anyone needing a celebration space. It is so easy to get to, parking is fantastic, and the energy is so cool. If you're looking for a venue that can be sophisticated, chic, elegant, or if you want to go casually elegant, old-school/hip (like we did), look no further. This is the place to be!

We're so happy we selected Wedgewood Weddings Jefferson Street Mansion for our wedding! Planning a wedding out-of-state was intimidating, and we booked the venue sight unseen, but ...

we couldn't have been more happy with the results. Having their own vendors for floral, cake, DJ, photography and invitations made things super easy. We couldn't attend the food tasting faire, but were so happy with all the options. The staff were very friendly and quick to answers all our questions along the way; we were particularly grateful for Nicole's help! A historic setting was important to me, and the space really impressed our guests. Would definitely recommend!

Additionally, their preferred vendors also did not disappoint! I' m so glad we went with them because we are a military family, and I personally didn't have time to plan a wedding and find vendors etc. Most importantly, they really helped me and adjusted to many of my last minute decisions! Super thank you to Kristen! Don't even hesitate, the venue and their team are super easy to work with! Many thanks!

hing is included and taken care of in a way that limits your stress down to only suits and dresses! We met with different consultants, but each one was well-aware of what had been previously discussed in-person and through emails (which was impressive because of the amount of times we changed certain things). The food was fantastic - from appetizers to cake. People are still raving about it a week later! A Love's In Bloom made bouquets I was obsessed with, nailing my vision with only my vague knowledge of flowers. The Old Towne Danville Bakery created a cake that everyone talked about it! Valarie (our florist) and Karen (our baker) took great care of us and really made the ceremony and reception beautiful. The DJ, Randy, kept us on schedule all night and had a great playlist to keep things festive. Our wedding day was amazing and easy to manage thanks to Wedgewood. I never post reviews, but I really can't speak highly enough of everyone at Wedgewood and all of their vendors.

If you have a chance to book this venue, please do! You will not regret it. And I absolutely recommend paying the tiny bit extra to have Morgan as your day of coordinator. She was a dream to work with and make the day absolutely perfect.

nues. So many wonderful photo opportunities around the property. Parking is easily available onsite. I also loved that the packages were completely customizable. We opted out of the invitations, cake, chocolate covered strawberries, floral, and wine on tables (didn't make sense since we had an open bar). I was glad that we were able to find our own vendors without additional fees or being limited to a "preferred" vendor list that many other venues require. David, the general manager, was exceptional to work with. He accommodated my every request, communicated effectively, and had a very approachable personality. He also served as our wedding coordinator and we had a smooth rehearsal and wedding. Morgan was helpful along the way as well and always responded positively and promptly to my emails. Guests commented on the staff's friendliness and responsiveness day of. Dawn, the bartender, was exceptional. I highly recommend requesting her. She brought us and our parents drinks all night and guests raved about her! Open bar was definitely a hit. We decided to extend the venue by 1 hour and we sure are glad that we did! Randy was an effective and efficient MC/DJ, he kept people up on the dance floor and adhered to our music preferences. Were so glad to have him for the extra hour; he is very confident and familiar with the venue which was a huge plus! Guests commented that the food was delicious, the panko crusted chicken was a crowd favorite. The salmon was also delicious. Appetizers were wonderful as well! The brie and apple phyllo kisses and bacon wrapped scallops were my personal favorites! Overall, I would highly recommend Wedgewood Jefferson Street Mansion. My wedding day was magical, stress-free, and beautiful. Special thanks to David, Dawn, Morgan and Randy!

ch a beautiful place! Not to mention the wonderful staff who went above and beyond to work out all of the details and make our dream day come to life. I really appreciate the way they communicated and touched base with me to make sure they have all the details correct and they were open for any changes that I made all throughout the process. Planning from way across the country could be very difficult but the Jefferson St. Mansion team was very professional and caring and they are just so wonderful to work with. They have everything you need, and a lot of options for couples who’s on a budget. I suggest availing the wedding coordinator option! Everything was taken care of for us the day of the wedding… it was the best feeling, as a bride, not having to worry about the details and just getting to enjoy the day. Having people that we trusted to take care of us on one of the most special days of our lives was a huge weight lifted off of our shoulders… and honestly, they exceeded our expectations! From start to finish, everything ran smoothly and we were able to just enjoy the time with our friends and family. The Mansion itself is absolutely stunning. It had that classic, sophisticated charm that we love! Also, the food was AMAZING! It is one of the first times I remember actually wanting to eat everything on my plate at a wedding! I could say so many more wonderful things about this venue… if you are considering having your wedding here, don't think twice! I promise that you will not be disappointed! We can never thank them enough for making our day so special… it truly was a day of pure joy. Shout out to Morgan, David, Ali and Dawn! You guys rock!

We used the JSM florist )ALovesInBloom), bakery (Old Town Danville Bakery), and DJ Randy at Pacific Entertainment). All were top notch. Karen at the Old Town Danville Bakery is such a sweetheart and makes absolutely amazing desserts (try the cream puffs and key lime bars). We live 45 min from the bakery but still go there for our special occasion desserts.

Renee, the concierge, throughout the whole process from first appoint to tour the mansion to the end of the event was always responsive, very helpful, connecting and professional. As the mother of the bride it was wonderful to be able to come and just enjoy. Her staff did all the setting up of everything and took down and packed it all after.
