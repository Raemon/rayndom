## Frequently Asked Questions

After browsing our favorite jewelry ideas for your girlfriend, you may still have questions. Keep reading for our advice on how to buy jewelry for your girlfriend, how much to spend and how to choose the right piece for any occasion.

### Is jewelry a good gift for your girlfriend?

Jewelry is usually a good gift for your girlfriend, unless she doesn't wear accessories at all. Assuming she does, pay attention to her sense of style, her favorite brands and her lifestyle. Splashing out on fancy jewelry doesn't make sense if she can't wear it (like if she has a metal allergy or works in a sterile environment). Once the practicalities are taken care of, you can get creative. What occasion are you shopping for? Perhaps you want to surprise her with cute matching [couples jewelry](https://www.theknot.com/content/couples-jewelry) or a [heart-shaped gift](https://www.theknot.com/content/heart-shaped-gifts) on your anniversary. Or maybe you're looking for birthday jewelry she can rock every day. Considering the reason behind your purchase will help you decide what jewelry to get for your girlfriend.

### How do you choose the right jewelry for your girlfriend?

Even if your relationship is in the early stages, you probably already have a sense of your girlfriend's personal style. Let this be your guide when choosing a piece of jewelry for her present. Does she like simple, understated accessories? Or is she all about layering multiple pieces that make a statement? Maybe she prefers silver to gold. Being observant pays off and will ultimately let her know you've made an effort. If she doesn't wear watches or rings (or you don't know her ring size), it's probably best to skip these altogether.

### How much should you spend on jewelry for your girlfriend?

While there's no minimum or maximum amount to spend on your girlfriend's jewelry gift, there are several factors to consider. First, note what you're able to afford and how much feels appropriate for the milestone or stage of your relationship. For example, a couple who's been dating for a few months may want to stick to something under $100, while a more long-term relationship may warrant more (though not necessarily). Similarly, if you're shopping for a big milestone (like a [25th](https://www.theknot.com/content/25th-birthday-gifts-for-girlfriend) or [30th birthday gift for your girlfriend](https://www.theknot.com/content/30th-birthday-gifts-for-girlfriend)), you may want to splurge on something sentimental. Remember, the amount you spend on a jewelry gift for your girlfriend doesn't determine how much she'll love it—it's the thought that counts after all.
