edule and where we would like the focus. The team really helped paint a beautiful picture for us. Then during the wedding day the team was very professional with the family. They were fun and brought the smiles out of everyone. They took stunning photos of my wife and I as well as amazing candid photos of all the guests having fun. They went above and beyond as we needed them in 3 separate locations. They also did side interviews with the guests. I highly recommend the full package with Avalanche. They are amazing and will give you the peace of mind and amazing results that everyone wants for their wedding.

I cannot express how happy we were to have gone with Avalanche Films. I went through countless wedding videos unable to find what I was looking for until I saw their work. Alec and...

Jon were our videographers during our wedding day. They did such an amazing job being inconspicuous, especially since my husband and I are both very awkward around cameras. The final video exceeded my expectations.. I was blown away by all the footage Jon and Alec were able to capture without us even noticing they were around. They were so accommodating with the different footage that we wanted captured and even allowed us to choose the song for the video. My husband and I are extremely happy that we went with Avalanche. If you are shopping for a videographer for your big day, do not hesitate to book these guys!!

We hired Avalanche as our wedding photographers and videographers in November 2023 and were thrilled with the results! We got married on a cruise ship before it departed, so there ...

were definite time constraints. They were so helpful and professional and captured so many amazing moments. They also streamed our wedding on Zoom for those who could not attend in person. The highlights film captured so many amazing moments from the day and brought my husband and I, as well as several family members, to tears when watching it. That video was so amazing that I ordered the longer film for my husband as a Valentine’s Day gift and I cannot wait to see what they do with it! When I got my edited photos back, there were a few edits I asked them to make and they turned out great. Throughout the process, their communication was impeccable! They really do everything possible to ensure that they get all the photos and moments that are important to you and listen and respond to any feedback. We couldn’t be happier with our choice!

Hiring Avalanche Film was an excellent decision for us when planning our wedding. Videography was one of the most important things. We looked at numerous blogs and websites before ...

coming to our final decision. Personally, I couldn't be happier with the choices we made for our videographer. On the day, Jon was confident and discreet, capturing many natural and candid moments. We absolutely enjoy watching our wedding videos and remembering all the happy moments! Thank you so much! The highlight video is awesome and my parents dancing together is such a treasure for us!

I can’t express how thankful we are to have Jon as our videographer for the wedding weekend. I am a wedding planner myself and have hired Jon to capture footage for my couples many...

times, and I knew right away I wanted him to be the person to capture all our special moments. Jon flew out from Los Angeles to Hunt Valley, Maryland, and began videographing my bridal shower on Friday afternoon, then our rehearsal dinner that evening, and finally our wedding day on Saturday. Jon was INCREDIBLE!! He has such an eye for capturing candid moments and putting pieces of the day into a beautiful love story. I will always cherish the moments on film of my mom and I laughing together, my aunt giving me a huge hug, my bridesmaids dancing in the bridal suite, and my husband seeing me walk down the aisle.. these are the moments I will always remember and now always have with me to watch over and over again. He is extremely professional and detail-oriented. Jon and I spoke on the phone about our priorities and overall vision for the video, and I can confidently say that he exceeded our expectations and truly went above and beyond for Matt & I. Thank you Jon, and please do not hesitate to book him for your next event! Love, The Dumonts
