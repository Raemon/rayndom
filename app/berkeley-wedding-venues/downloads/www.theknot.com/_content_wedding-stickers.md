## Where to Buy Wedding Stickers

If you're just beginning your search for stickers for your wedding, you've come to the right place! Here, we've listed six of the best sites for a variety of wedding stickers. Some allow you to create your own wedding stickers while others offer generic options that are both budget-friendly and beautiful.

  * [**The Knot Invitations**](https://www.theknot.com/paper/ceremony-reception/stickers)**:** The ultimate one-stop shop for all your wedding stationery needs. You'll find more than 30 pages of wedding stickers to browse, in all styles, shapes and colors. Many of our stickers let you adjust the color scheme by clicking through the provided color samples to see which works best for you. Scroll down the page to easily view The Knot's entire suite of coordinating stationery for a cohesive look. 
  * [**Etsy**](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6220&awinaffid=565019&campaign=&clickref=Theknot.com-wedding-stickers&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dweddingstickers%26ref%3Dsearch_bar&platform=pl)**:** For an assortment of more generic wedding stickers, like welcome-to-our-wedding or thank-you stickers, consider Etsy. It's also a great place to shop for monogrammed wedding stickers, and we found a particularly large assortment of clear, personalized wedding stickers that let your names (or your message) take center stage. 
  * [**Zazzle**](https://www.zazzle.com/s/wedding+stickers)**:** Easily search Zazzle's expansive collection of personalized wedding stickers using their convenient filters. You'll find everything from modern to rustic wedding stickers and even cute wedding stickers featuring your furry friends. While Zazzle does offer coordinating wedding stationery suites, you can also find generic designs featuring wedding-ready florals and greenery that coordinate well with any wedding invitations. 
  * [**Amazon**](https://amzn.to/3WSt0g8)**:** This is your source for popular options like foil wedding stickers and heart wedding stickers, both available in silver and gold. These add a touch of class to your wedding invitations if you're looking for a budget-friendly option for stickers for a wedding.
  * [**Minted**](https://mintedllc.sjv.io/c/64733/1712109/19909?subId1=Theknot.com-wedding-stickers&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.minted.com%2Fsearch%3Fs%3Dwedding%2Bstickers%26feature%3Dsearch%26event%3Dtype%26value%3Dwedding%2Bstickers)**:** Here, you'll find both stickers and wax seal stickers for wedding invitations, in various colors and designs. Many of their wedding stickers and seals are offered in various colors, which you can easily view by clicking through the color palettes below the stickers. A convenience search function also lets you filter by the color you're looking for. 
  * [**Personalization Mall**](https://personalizationmall.sjv.io/c/64733/2382364/29824?subId1=Theknot.com-wedding-stickers&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.personalizationmall.com%2Fsearch.aspx%3Fsf%3D1%26searchString%3Dwedding%2Bstickers%26x%3D0%26y%3D0)**:** For affordable custom wedding stickers, you can't beat Personalization Mall.
