eciated their flexibility for getting all of the photos we wanted including doing a “Photo Dash” on the dance floor to help us get photos with every guest in attendance! They worked incredibly well together and with our videographer team and we absolutely loved working with them! They sent us a ton of amazing and beautiful photos and they knew exactly how to pose us and our giant bridal party! My only recommendation would be to ask if they could use the same camera and settings for both photographers so all photos have the exact same look and feel, but otherwise, my husband and I only have positive things to say about working with the team at LA Love Weddings! They did a phenomenal job and we would recommend them to anyone looking to get amazing photographs of their wedding day!

Armani, Tiffany, and Billie were amazing! They were very responsive from the start and very easy to work with. When planning our engagement photoshoot with them, we provided a list...

of potential destinations and they went above and beyond by researching pricing, permit requirements, and time restrictions at all of the potential locations. They made us feel comfortable and helped with our posing which made both the engagement shoot and our wedding day feel very easy. Our wedding day was a 16 hour marathon with multiple locations and they shot everything and everyone beautifully! We could not have asked for a better photo/video team to capture our special day!

s made throughout the event. Moreover, I appreciated how responsive and awesome they were after the event itself! They were quick to upload and send an incredible amount of content our way, and they were able to provide even more when I asked a year later! Finally, the wedding video they made for us was truly incredible - it brings my wife and I to tears every time we watch it as it perfectly distilled what made our special day so special. Highly recommended!
