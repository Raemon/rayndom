Sidney Phan

Founder & Lead Planner

— Someone who believes that every day holds a reason to celebrate. Born and raised in Michigan, I eventually found my creative home in San Francisco, where my love for art, people, and joyful design all meet. Creativity has always been my language — now, I get to speak it through events. What I love most about this work are the small, human moments that make life sweet — the laughter shared over a glass of wine, the quiet tears during a first look, a parent’s proud smile, or the messy happiness of a child sneaking a lick of frosting. Those tiny moments are why I do what I do. When I'm not planning events, you can find me coffee shop-hopping, roller skating in Golden Gate Park, or taking full advantage of the SF views!

Absolutely loved working with Sidney! She is incredibly creative, organized, and thoughtful - always going above and beyond to truly understand our vision. Sidney brought our weddi...

ng dreams to life in ways we never imagined, elevating our ideas and connecting us with the perfect vendors. She’s practical yet whimsical, a great listener, and genuinely wonderful to be around. Sidney anticipated our needs before we even realized them, making the entire process smooth and enjoyable. While we were, of course, thrilled to be married, it was bittersweet when the wedding was over because it meant we wouldn’t get to talk to her as often. Highly recommend Sidney - you won’t regret it!

Sid has impeccable taste and truly thought of everything. We appreciate that she understood the vision and our vibe without much explaining. She's so rad! We were grateful not only for her professional nature but also for her constant, easygoing, never-stressed, friendly demeanor. It made the day stress-free for us! We can't wait to work with Sid again in the future!

I’ve had the pleasure of working with Sid both as a bridesmaid for a wedding and as her assistant at a wedding. In both settings, I have seen how she brings expertise, care, and fu...

n to everything she does for her brides and for her guests. She’s a former nurse, so she brings that level of care, attention, and “do whatever needs to be done” attitude to your wedding. She has an outstanding artistic vision, creates beautiful wedding suites, and thinks deeply about the guest experience at every turn. She always has a smile on, but she still takes everything so seriously and ensures that whatever you want your wedding day to look and feel like, it will. In short, I can’t recommend Sid enough for anyone looking to have an outstanding experience as a bride or groom on their wedding day.

Our wedding day was absolutely perfect, and we owe so much of that to Sidney! From start to finish, she was professional, organized, and an absolute joy to work with. Her attentio...

n to detail was remarkable. She ensured every aspect of the day went smoothly, from vendor coordination to the ceremony timeline and exactly like we wanted. She always made us feel heard and respected our vision while offering invaluable suggestions to enhance our ideas. Sidney purposely left us out of the vendor logistical communications a week before the wedding so we were able to relax and enjoy the days leading up to our wedding. Thanks to her meticulous planning, we were able to fully enjoy our special day without worrying about timing or if we are missing anything. It was a seamless, stress-free experience, and our guests couldn’t stop raving about how beautiful and well-organized everything was. If you’re looking for someone who will go above and beyond to make your wedding dreams come true, we wholeheartedly recommend Sidney!

Sid was an absolute pleasure to work with for our wedding. From the very beginning, her communication style was informative, concise and clear, which was so helpful during the plan...

ning process. Sid provided us with great ideas, were extremely detailed-oriented, and had a wonderfully personable approach. She was amazing at making our special day seamless - she even helped fill an extra hour between the ceremony and reception with fun group activities and photos. We would 100% recommend her to any couple looking for an stress-free, personalized wedding experience. Sid has truly become a friend through this entire journey.

Hiring Sid to run and oversee our wedding day was hands-down the best decision and one of the most integral parts of why our day went so smoothly. She is energetic, positive, organ...

ized, and culturally sensitive. I truly felt like I was working with a friend which I deeply appreciated. She has a great eye for design and aesthetics as well. I appreciate her work ethic and that she is willing to work with brides who are extremely detail-oriented like myself. I could tell she values organization and getting the details right throughout her work. Highly recommend!
