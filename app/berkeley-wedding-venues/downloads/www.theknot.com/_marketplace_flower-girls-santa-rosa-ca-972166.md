We relied on the reviews here to find our florist and could not be more grateful that we went with Nancy and Flower Girls. From the very beginning, I could tell that Nancy LOVES wh...

at she does and that she is a master at her craft. From just talking with me about what was still a vision-in-progress, Nancy knowingly and knowledgeably listed off some flower options that would achieve the look and feel I was going for. She fashioned arrangements that brought my floral dreams to life. For the pieces I was more sure about, like garlands of greens and eucalyptus, she exceeded my expectations in the most awe-inspiring way. Nancy was a joy to work with from start to finish. Easy to talk to, caring and engaged, and—again— a true master at her craft. She is upfront about costs and availability, and applies her creativity in working with a budget. I will recommend her to any who’ll listen!

Oh, man, if you need flowers for your event, and don't want to spend the same amount as the venue on them, please give Nancy a call. She was super prompt with her responses (unlike...

several others), which helped me greatly because I did almost all of the planning from across the country. She worked with my planner seamlessly, and the setup for the ceremony and reception...I was blown away by what she did. In addition to her great work, she is the kindest person you'll meet. I thoroughly enjoyed working with her.

Nancy did a WONDERFUL job with my wedding flowers. They turned out so much better than I could have ever expected. She was so easy to work with and very flexible. I met with her on...

ce, sent her photos of what I had in mind, as well as photos of all of our dresses, tuxes, etc. so she had an idea of the overall look of the wedding, and I just let her do her thing. I had told her beforehand that if I wasn't at the hall when she arrived to deliver, she could just leave them in the reception room. However, as soon as I arrived (a little late too, thanks to transportation issues) she immediately greeted me, saying she had waited for me because she was so certain I would LOVE how everything turned out, and she wanted to see my reaction. She was really SO right. I loved my bouquet, my bridesmaid's bouquets, and all the corsages & boutonnieres she made for the occasion. They were all better than I could have dreamed of.

Getting the right flowers for your wedding can be one of the most difficult and expensive steps towards prepping for your special day. However, thanks to Nancy and her company, the...

Flower Girls, it couldn't have gotten any easier or more affordable! She took care of every detail with ease and great communication. From the flower package, to the color of the ribbon, she showed both talent and expertise in creating the perfect wedding flowers for me and my wedding party. The quality of her flowers cannot be paralleled. My bouquet was not only gorgeous, but fresh, resilient, and looked beautiful the entire day through the ceremony, pictures, reception, etc. Lastly, Nancy is a joy to work with and a gem to know. She has a passion and energy for what she does and it shown through in her efforts and delivery. We were truly blessed to have the opportunity to work with her.

Nancy was great! I've sent her google images of what I had in mind for the center piece and my bouquet, and delivered just like I imagined. I was grateful that she delivered our ...

bouquet to the hotel room, since we were taking pictures before the ceremony! I don't mean to offend Nancy, but my fiance was worried that Flower Girls didn't exist, because they don't have a store location. But you'll find out that there's a reason for it. I can guarantee that she will deliver what you ask for and she is professional! Thank you again Nancy!!
