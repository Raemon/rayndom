Deerfield Ranch Winery was a beautiful and unique place to host a wedding, and we definitely recommend it! The outdoor crushpad was the perfect place to host our ceremony and rece...

ption, with a beautiful backdrop of vines and mountains. And, the wine cave & tasting room made a very fun space for our wine hour. Our friends and family kept commenting on how beautiful and unique the venue was. And, they keep asking about the Deerfield Ranch red wine blend! In addition to the beauty, we chose Deerfield Ranch because we quickly connected with their friendly staff, and were inspired by the winery’s history. Dustin and Dino were very helpful and accommodating to our questions and needs through the planning process. We stayed in the cottage on property, a short drive away, which has a kitchen, living area, bedroom, and bathroom. The cottage is situated on top of a very beautiful hill, which made for a very relaxing morning prior to the big day. We loved the hill views so much that we took some of our couples pictures there!
