Erika was an absolute pleasure to work with for a variety of reasons and we’re so lucky she was our wedding planner! From start to finish, Erika is a true professional and helped u...

s have the wedding we both wanted. She guided us to the right vendors, put together a detailed spreadsheet to help us stay organized with regular updates, provided insight around all the different factors that go into planning a wedding, kept us on track with weekly calls and was extremely helpful with her availability to help us talk through ideas or answer any questions we had. She helped us understand our contracts, introduced us to all the vendors we worked with to help us gain familiarity and comfort, and last but not least, she executed our wedding-day flawlessly. She handled every situation with high levels of care+quality, deep levels of focus and professional excellence. She provided the best experience and took care of us the entire way, from the start of planning (even brainstorming) to the day of. On our wedding day, she was on point coordinating it all and her excellence was fully on display. For example, there was a slight 30min-1hr rain delay and she handled it with all of our vendors while simultaneously ensuring our guests were taken care of and knew where to go to ensure they were having a great time. We didn’t feel the pressure of the delay nor did it feel like the day was cut short in any way. All the work she did behind the scenes to ensure we weren’t stressed, worried or thinking about anything else other than our big day together was top notch and greatly appreciated, anyone would be lucky to have Erika as their wedding planner! Thank you again Erika for being who you are and being such a big part of our unforgettable wedding day, we are forever grateful!

Working with Erika from Sealed With a Kiss Events was one of the best decisions we made during our wedding planning process. From start to finish, she made everything feel seamless...

and manageable. Erika guided my husband and me through weekly calls, ensuring we stayed on track while also feeling supported and heard. Her creative vision was unmatched. She curated multiple aesthetic boards that brought our ideas to life and helped us narrow down the look and feel we wanted. Erika also connected us with top-tier vendors across various price points, always being mindful of both our budget and timeline. Her level of organization is pristine. Erika is incredibly professional, honest in her guidance, and always respectful of our vision. What stood out most was how she made us feel; calm, cared for, and confident. By the end of the process, she truly felt like family. On the wedding day, Erika was a powerhouse. She coordinated with all the vendors, managed detailed timelines, and made sure every single detail was flawless. We were able to fully enjoy our day knowing Erika had everything under control. I could write a novel about how invaluable Erika was to our wedding. She wasn’t just a planner, she was an integral part of making our dream day come to life. If you're lucky enough to work with her, you're in the best hands.

We’re not sure how many people can truly say their wedding was perfect, but we absolutely can and that was all thanks to Erika and her team at Sealed with a Kiss (SWAK). Erika was ...

recommended to us by the groom’s former co-worker and we knew we had made a fantastic decision from our first call. After giving her our initial thoughts for a small intimate wedding, Erika helped us align towards a vision that better fit our needs - transitioning from a hectic City Hall ceremony to an intimate, May ceremony and dinner in Napa. Early in our wedding planning journey, we actually were able to attend one of Erika’s other weddings, which had over 200 people in attendance and incorporated four distinct cultures, and can attest Erika and SWAK can do it all. We saw Erika and SWAK execute that very large and beautiful wedding with precision and grace. Erika made our wedding planning process efficient and easy to understand, is incredibly communicative, and is very creative in her wedding concept designs. On the day of our wedding, shortly before the ceremony, the bride’s father had a button come off his military uniform. The SWAK assistant helping with the wedding swooped in and sewed the button back on with ease, fixing the only slightly stressful moment of the day. Otherwise, the ceremony, cocktail hour, and dinner went off without a hitch. We had the best wedding thanks to Erika and her team, and we will forever be grateful to them. You will not regret hiring her!

We did a partial planning and day of coordination package with Erika, and she was an absolute joy to work with. She helped keep us calm while providing great advice (she has great ...

taste!), and in the month leading up to the wedding helped us make sure that we had really thought of everything. One example was her help in our choice of linens. She helped us think about the fabric and design in a way which provided us the clarity and logistical support we needed to make a decision we felt good about. Erika is also very organized and a clear communicator, and helped us keep ourselves organized with her excellent planning sheet. She created an incredibly detailed itinerary for the day-of the big event to make sure that we, alongside all our vendors, knew exactly how the day was supposed to go. By the time of the event, we were completely confident that with Erika, everything would go smoothly, which it did. The day-of went great, made better by Erika and her assistants' joyous, empathetic and calm attitudes and expert handling of all the complex logistics.

We worked with Erika for a year and a half on our multicultural (Indian, Colombian, Korean, Vietnamese, American/Western) 200+ guest and 20+ vendor count wedding, and we literally ...

could not have done this without her. From the beginning, Erika welcomed us and our wedding dreams in with open arms. The entire time she felt like a friend - so kind, warm, and easy to talk to. She put no restrictions on how often we wanted to chat, and was so flexible in anything and everything we asked for during the planning process. Erika had a plethora of vendor connections to work with, and went above and beyond in vetting out new ones for various random asks we had as well. Her creative eye for aesthetics made the design process so easy and seamless for us as the couple. Erika cares about and protects you as her clients to the fullest, and ensures you get the best you need in every aspect of the wedding. If you have any concern or worry about any aspect of the wedding planning or execution, Erika is there is help and problem solve until the worry is gone (ex: Erika helped arranged an in-person mock up between our rentals, linens, and florals and talked with everyone, including us, tirelessly until we got the design perfect). On the day of, Erika and her team of assistants made the entire day for us so incredibly smooth. Erika and her team truly allowed us to sit back and enjoy our wedding without any worries at all. We've been told by multiple guests that our wedding was the best they've ever been to! I look back at the wedding planning process with so much love and joy for Erika and her team. Sealed With A Kiss Events was the best investment in our wedding because without her it would not have been as close to the best day of our lives as it was.

thin just three and a half months. She kept us organized and on track throughout the process. Her vendor referrals were excellent, and she handled both big challenges and small tasks (even recommending bridal accessories) with ease. On the wedding day, we had to move our ceremony from an outdoor to an indoor space due to an unexpected snowstorm in early May in Tahoe. Erika promptly made all the necessary adjustments, ensuring everything went smoothly. Our guests were in awe of the beautiful setup, and we received countless compliments on it being the most beautiful wedding they had ever attended. Erika's attention to detail and dedication truly made our wedding unforgettable. We highly recommend Erika to anyone looking for a top-notch wedding planner!

She provided us with an abundance of resources and recommendations, each one tailored to our preferences. Erika's ability to anticipate our needs and address our concerns before they even arose was nothing short of magical. She handled every challenge with grace and professionalism, always ensuring that we felt heard, valued, and supported. Her unwavering dedication to making our wedding a success was truly inspiring.

d Erika! We did full-planning package with her as she had experience working with Fort Mason and coordinating all the necessary vendors that the venue requires, keen eye for design and understood (and loved) the vision we had for our wedding. Erika kept us on track with all of our monthly ‘action items’ so we never feel like we were rushed or behind on the important details. We also leveraged many of her established and trusted vendor relationships (rentals, florist, etc.) to execute our vision. Literally, not ONE detail or thing went wrong or was ‘off’ on our wedding day - that is a true testament of Erika. From the details, vendors, timeline and guest experience, it was all executed perfectly and according to the plan. Our family, vendors and guests spoke so highly of Erika and her assistant the day-of and the professionalism and attentiveness they provided everyone. We couldn’t have had our perfect day without them!

ue. She's really compassionate and understanding about trying to keep costs down and finding some workarounds to still make your day perfect. The other piece that really made me land on Erika/SWAK as my wedding planner was the fee structure. While somewhat expensive for a full wedding planner, I wasn't beholden to a certain number of calls or emails or anything like that, which was super important to me! I had a long engagement (1.5 years) and I was able to find time with Erika weekly for about 45-60 minutes, as needed, at no additional cost. She was really helpful in talking through decisions with me and how to execute on my vision. And then the day of came and she's both your cheerleader AND the person behind the scenes making sure everything is in tip-top shape so you don't have to worry about a thing. Would highly recommend Erika!

Nothing we could have dreamed of could have compared to the most magical wedding day that Erika helped us bring to life! We were so lucky to work with Erika Kobziak of Sealed with ...

a Kiss Events. Something that was really important to us was to find a planner that we really clicked with, who resonated with our love story and understood who we are as people and as a couple. That was clear from our very first consultation with Erika-- we immediately felt her genuine enthusiasm and excitement to help us create our special day. Even though we went with a partial, not full service, wedding plan, we never felt like just another one of her clients - she was consistently attentive, readily responsive, and always ready and eager to come to the table with new thoughts and ideas we absolutely LOVED. It was clear that Erika has such a wealth of experience in the wedding world, and working with her was stress-free as she kept us super organized and on-task month by month leading up to the big day. With the few obstacles we came across with communicating with one of our other vendors, she never broke a sweat and confidently resolved issues as soon as possible. Her assistants on the day of our wedding, Tatiana and Olivia, were just as warm, attentive, and organized as Erika, and we are so thankful for their hard work from start to finish to make the day just absolutely perfect. All our family and guests also remarked on how thoughtful and on-the-ball Erika and her team were. Truly, we lucked out with such an incredible wedding planner like Erika, and would HIGHLY recommend her to any couple looking to have the wedding of their dreams. We'll miss working with her... but we're excited to see all the other incredible weddings she'll plan!

We loved having Erika from Sealed With A Kiss Events as our wedding planner! Our wedding was fairly complex to organize, as we got married at a remote venue near Yosemite, with all...

our guests staying on property, and we had three days of activities. We couldn’t have pulled it all off without Erika and the SWAK team. We chose the month-of wedding management option, and we also did several one-off consultations in the months before our wedding, which were useful for getting advice on specific topics. The SWAK team gave us a very helpful spreadsheet to help us manage all the details and stay on track with our planning timeline. Once we were in the month-of window, it was a big relief to have Erika take over the vendor management and many of the logistics, so we could relax and focus on ourselves. During our wedding weekend, Erika was so on top of every detail, from the decor to the timing, and she truly made our vision come to life. We were able to be fully present and enjoy every minute of it. We particularly appreciated how Erika jumped in to handle some unexpected things that came up (including a stressful last-minute vendor cancellation), and her warm, calming presence throughout the weekend. Do not hesitate to book Erika/SWAK for your wedding!

Working with Erika was the best decision we made for our wedding. When we contacted Sealed With A Kiss Events, we had already picked our date and venue and we had less than 6 month...

s to plan. We chose the full planning package for our wedding of 150 people in San Francisco. Erika hit the ground running for us right away. She helped us put together an amazing vendor team and kept everyone so organized and engaged during the process. Our weekly check in calls were always productive and we felt comfortable chatting with her about any questions or concerns. The planning process was so enjoyable because she kept us laughing and she kept us calm. Erika worked tirelessly on the timeline for the wedding day and the day went so smoothly. I have no idea if there were any issues on the day because Erika handled everything and we were able to enjoy every moment. Erika is patient, kind, fun, real, and super organized. I have already recommended her to friends and family and I hope I get to attend another wedding that she's planned one day!

It is also very clear that Lara has an immense amount of experience and wants the best for her clients.

Planning a wedding during the COVID-19 pandemic was incredibly challenging especially since things seemed to change every day. Lara was incredibly hard working, patient, and dilige...

nt in making sure our planning and wedding day went smoothly. She took off a lot of stress and made things very easy for us by working around the clock and giving us many options with impressive detail. When we needed to change venues due to government regulations, Lara mapped out our options, included cost analyses, and facilitated all the logistics, helping us navigate a very confusing, emotional time. We loved working with Lara because of her endless compassion, passion, and practicality. I have never met a kinder person, and in choosing our wedding planner over a year ago, we had one call with Lara and knew from the start that she was genuinely a lovely, hardworking, generous person. Then with the craziness of the pandemic changing almost all of our plans, she also proved to be wise counsel and incredibly supportive of our situation. She was well up to date on all news briefings and how other vendors/planners were now navigating the new terrain. And while we are sure it was incredibly difficult on her as well given her new role as a mom in an industry rocked by the effects of a pandemic, she never faltered in her professionalism, promptness, nor compassion. Furthermore, even before the pandemic, it was evident that Lara was incredibly organized and experienced has she knew each week what needed to be done in order to allow us the least amount of stress leading up to the original wedding date. Yes, so much of our planning changed in the end, but at the start of our planning, it was so helpful given our busy schedules as a medical student and full-time engineer. With her excellent taste, impressive experience, and thorough demeanor, Lara is the perfect wedding planner for a destination wedding during a world-wide crisis. But with her compassionate personality, wisdom, and resilience, Lara is just an overall wonderful person. We have been so blessed to work with her!

ferent time of the year. We had been following SWAK on social media since its inception and every time we saw a post we knew they had to plan our wedding. I'm happy to report what she posts is the reality, the color schemes and flowers and colors were just spot on. She definitely delivered on exactly that! SWAK has a great list of vendors, has great tricks on saving money on rentals and was just overall a great experience to work with. We opted for the full end to end package so everything was delegated and for the first time in my life I felt comfortable leaving my phone in my bag at a major event. She had the right amount of direction, controlled the crowd beautifully and made us feel good, not even rushed, despite all the mishaps that happen at a wedding. I would highly highly recommend Sealed with a Kiss as a wedding planner.

he made everything come together without a hitch. Even in difficult circumstances with running out of space on one bus, and working from a venue with no cell phone service, she made it all come together perfectly. It makes all of the difference in the world to work with someone so capable that we could hand-off months of planning to her and be completely confident that she would make it all work out. Working with Lara made it possible to actually relax and enjoy the day instead of trying to coordinate the wedding. Sealed With A Kiss Events were a pleasure to work with. Actually, they are the one vendor that my sister also hired when getting married two years later.

se her to take over for the final month and boy did she ever. All the vendors, all the drama, all the chaos...NOT MY PROBLEM. She worked her butt off, kept the ball rolling, and delivered what by all standards was a SUPER complicated wedding in the middle of nowhere with 2 bands, a DJ, photographers, food issues, no phone service, on & on. Beyond that she is just a really good person; she listens, she laughs, she wants to succeed FOR YOU and she cares. I literally can't say enough good things about her. 3 years later we are still in contact and I still remember how good it felt to have her in our corner.

hs away. Needless to say I am not a big planner. The problem is...it turns out weddings are a big jumble of plans. ---certainly not my cup of tea. I know "typical guy," right? Also, in typical guy fashion I had no time to help plan the wedding and wan not flexible on the date. However, I did need it to be perfect. Seems simple enough... As it turns out, it was that simple. My wife found Lara with Sealed With A Kiss, and everything just happened. Perfectly! I met with Lara once(my wife obviously had further communication) told her my vision and budget and left it in her hands. She did EVERYTHING else! She found the venue(on the lake in Tahoe) flowers, food, dj even the rooms to stay in. My wedding day was magical and went off better than I could have dreamed. I honestly do not know what we would have done without Lara. Her day of help was just as awesome as her planning. From setup to break down she was there to make sure everything was taken care of and we were able to just enjoy our day. The help was priceless! Speaking of price... with the industry discounts and negotiating she did for us, she actually paid for herself. There is just no beating that. Although I was happy to pay every penny for her skill, knowledge and professionalism. I could not reccomend Lara enough.

e month of, Lara also assisted in helping me plan our wedding two months before the Big Day. I was engaged February 2018, and we were excited and thrilled when we set the date for Feb, 2019 in San Francisco. I spent several months struggling to make decisions with vendors, theme, color, etc. I'm extremely organized and enjoy event planning, so one would think, I would have my entire wedding planned from the minute I was engaged. But I was overwhelmed with Grad School and Work and unable to make any decisions. I hired Lara the month of December, 2018. Lara was extremely patient and assisted me with hiring vendors and helped us make critical decisions for our wedding that was around the corner. She put me at ease, and I knew from the minute we had our consultation appointment, she would make all our dreams come true. And she did! Lara is extremely organized and is well known in San Francisco, and I'm sure other cities as well. I honestly would have broken out in hives from stress, if Lara did not come into my life. My sister is hopefully next in line, and Lara is on speed dial to be her Wedding Planner.

oral design concepts, etc. and then for the last month/day of planning. We are so pleased we did. At the beginning Lara spent time to get to know Sara and her fiancé, she provided a wonderful shared planning tool that we used over the 18 month planning timeline, and provided various creative ideas that ultimately became the design for the wedding & reception. She remained available to consult over the 18 months and then seamlessly stepped in one month before to take on overall coordination. My daughter and I were able to totally relax and feel confident that all of the details leading up to the big day & the day of would be managed seamlessly. Lara is a charming, empathetic, upbeat, well organized professional who ended up feeling like a new friend by the time the wedding was over. You won’t find anyone better than Lara & Sealed With a Kiss Events!

be perfect. She never once projected her own visions for what our wedding should look like, she always listened and came back to us with suggestions to guide our own ideas. She never pushed us to go over our budget - she always presented a variety of options. She was super responsive, which I appreciated to no end -- it didn't matter how small the request or worry was -- Lara was always there will a helpful text or note, letting us know that she was all over the situation. Lara is the perfect wedding planner for a bride and groom who don't want any type of agenda or vision pushed on them. She listens carefully, and if there is any room for correction, she goes back to the drawing board until all parties are happy. She was so committed to making sure that not only did we have fun throughout the wedding planning process, but because of her thoughtful planning and great execution, I didn't have a care in the world on my wedding day. I couldn't have done any of this without Lara and her team!

All of the vendors she suggested were amazing and her style is impeccable and she provided wonderful guidance throughout, including areas where we could cut back in order to stay in budget.

Our wedding day was one of the most relaxed and calmest days of my life partially because Lara had every detail nailed down ahead of time, and I truly did not have to worry about a thing. If there was a detail or problem on our wedding day then I couldn't tell you because Lara handled everything so seamlessly. We used the Sealed with a Kiss team for a month of planner and it was the best decision we ever made. I love that she works with her mom and sister because they definitely treat you like you are part of their family.

She takes time to listen and try to understand your visions. We met several times and enjoyed every time we spent time together. She is so responsive, caring and respects our budget and preference. Our wedding was very intimate and invited guests coming from different countries. I wanted to have a garden with a ocean view within 1-hr driving distance from SF, which would be convenient for our guests. She found us the best venue that included everything we wanted and turned what we had envisioned into reality on the wedding day: the ocean, the garden, the flowers, the color palette, and everything else. Not only that she is highly professional, but also she is the very easy going person and you enjoy interacting with her. I highly recommend you give her a call, if you want to have peace of mind for your wedding planning process and turn your dream wedding into reality. :)

I cannot say enough good things about Lara Kreutner, her team, and Sealed With a Kiss. To say that Lara and her team went above and beyond to plan our wedding is an understatement....

Lara ensured that every detail was created to perfection and handled professionally, no matter how large or small. Not only did Lara help us created the perfect vision for our wedding, she also managed the process—taking away any stress from my husband and me. In the lead up to our wedding, Lara became a source of guidance and comfort. When there was problem, she handled it with polite professionalism and always got us the result we wanted. I cannot tell you how many people complimented the beautiful wedding Lara created for us. Every person that interacted with her—vendors, guests, family, friends—all went on and on about her work ethic, professionalism, taste, and overall positive attitude. Lara is one is million in her execution and style. She also has an incredibe kindness to her and is one of the most understanding people I have ever met. She makes everything she comes into contact with brighter and more beautiful. She also had a heart of gold and is truly passionate about what she does—love literally floats around her. I would recommend her to anyone and will never truly be able to put into words how wonderful she is. If you want to have the best day of your life, use Sealed with a Kiss, and we guarantee you will have it.

my fiancé plan our destination wedding in Rutherford - in five months - without either of us ever having been out there. She was the perfect combination of expert in all things logistics and designer (she has a wonderful eye!), extreme organizer, and wonderful support system. She did everything from help me pick out a design scheme when I was paralyzed with indecision, to negotiate a last minute, hour-of dispute between my fiancé and I about toasting order :) For someone like me who is not THAT into the wedding planning, Lara is the ideal mix of pragmatism and sincere investment in her clients. (Shorthand: she is warm but not cheesy) My only regret is that I only hired Lara for month of planning + consulting. She was wonderful and totally available for any and all questions/consulting I had before the “month of,” but my fiancé and I both said to ourselves immediately after the wedding that the one thing we would have done differently is spent a little more money and handed the reins over to her even earlier. Thank you so much Lara, and a preemptive congratulations to anyone who hires you in the future!

She easily forms bonds with you other vendors and you can tell they feel comfortable with her in charge. She is an easy person to respect and trust.

I was blown away - I don't know how I would have done it without her. I even had a work trip out of the country two weeks before the wedding, and I knew everything was on track and in Sarah's capable hands. We had a huge curveball 2 days before the event - the Marriott workers were on strike - and I was concerned naturally what was going to happen to my wedding. But Sarah took care of everything - from making sure the vendors could park, to bringing breakfast (since the hotel didn't have room service anymore). It was a super ridiculous situation that no one could have predicted but Sarah came through. And I'm not the only one impressed; my other vendors came up to me afterwards to ask details about Sarah, so they can recommend her to other clients, because she was such a pleasure to work with.

dding, and in particular the day of our wedding, we were completely calm, which is really unusual for two Type-A people! She is incredibly professional, organized, thorough, communicative, and exactly who you want running the show on one of the most important days of your life. Above all, she is one of the sweetest people I've ever met. Her process is extremely comprehensive, and she did so much work behind the scenes to bring us a day that was totally smooth, from setting up our table design with her assistants to running our rehearsal the day before, printing our vows, procuring various last minute necessary items, making necessary adjustments with our wedding vendors, to leading the bridal party members (and myself!) around our confusing venue, cueing them when to walk, bringing us our flowers and gifts after the wedding, organizing our getaway car, and a thousand other things I'm not even aware of. I've never met anyone as thoroughly prepared or who does her homework as extensively as Sarah. Schedules, blueprints, arrival/break down times, and instagram hashtags were all sent in advance to the relevant parties. In fact, though it was her first time as lead planner for a wedding at our venue, the venue site coordinator requested that she come back to do future events with them! It's truly a testament to her planning skills, preparedness, and above all, her personality. We received rave reviews about how beautiful the wedding was and how smoothly everything went. She was very interested in making our wedding vision come true and at the same time we love her sense of style, which is the biggest reason we went with SWAK events. If I could do it all over again 100 times, I would go with Sarah again every time. Absolutely no complaints, A+, 100%. Thank you so much, Sarah!

As the parents of the groom, we would like to commend Lara for keeping us totally informed of what was expected of us. We always knew where we were to be allowing us to enjoy every...

minute of the day both before and during the wedding. We also would like to say that the wedding was the most beautiful event, both visually and emotionally, we have ever attended. Lara's attention to detail was obvious and her taste is impeccable. Everything was picture perfect and magazine worthy. Our favorite part of the event was sitting on the side opposite our son so we could see his face the entire time. His reaction to his bride when he saw her was priceless and we would not have seen it as well had we not been sitting opposite him. We would recommend Lara for any event. She is thoughtful, experienced, organized, professional and has fabulous taste. Most of all Lara will make that day perfect and an event to remember. She was a joy to work with

As a couple with demanding jobs, we knew we needed help planning our wedding. We didn't have any trouble getting started - but wrangling the details and hiring the last couple of v...

endors ended up being far more overwhelming than we expected. Hiring Lara for month-of services was the perfect antidote to the pressure that started to mount as we got closer to the date. Seven weeks out, with no photographer or florist chosen, Lara jumped right in with recommendations, made connections and helped us understand and calibrate ourselves to the quotes we were getting. As the day got closer, she created a full day-of itinerary for both of us (as well as our families!), handled all of the vendors, coordinated with the venue, gave suggestions about the tablescape and basically made it all look easy. Which, of course, it isn't. She's just that good. :) I believe that Lara actually is unflappable and just doesn't get stressed about anything. I have no evidence of anything to the contrary. She comes armed with an amazing sense of humor, calm demeanor and was at the other end of a text message at any hour of the day, as needed. She also has a mean animated gif game, when words just aren't enough. ;) In the end, the wedding was gorgeous and went off without a hitch. It truly was a magical day - and we were able to focus on the experience of it instead of worrying about anything. She had it all covered.
