through their beautiful photos means the world to us. They delivered so many photos and captured all the little details and moments we would’ve missed. We're so happy we booked them and can't recommend them enough!

cided to utilize all the money for our big wedding into a new home. With that being said I was beyond stressed in getting “perfect” photos. Alicia was amazing and kept me calm, it was very windy, and she reassured me everything is ok. Received our “sneak peaks”, and I’m really happy with how they turned out. You guys rock!!!

Alicia and Garrett were so amazing and we are so happy we hired them to be our photographers for our wedding. They captured our love and our wedding so beautifully and timelessly. ...

I am so happy we have such beautiful photos to look at for years to come and to show our kids on day. They are so easy going, went with the flow of the day and were so kind and understanding. We received a sneak peek of our wedding photos quickly after the wedding day and then received our full album exactly 6 weeks later, on the week of Christmas. They are such professionals and one of the best decisions we made.

Alicia and Garrett from A Lovely Photo went above and beyond when it came to photographing our wedding in September 2017. We had a fusion wedding (Indian/Filipino and Sri Lankan) a...

nd I knew that I wanted to capture the event as well as the details of our cultures. Alicia and Garrett arrived on time, assisted with set up and even helped with maintaining our timeline. They put us at ease and I could not be happier with the results. Her packages worked well within my budget and we were able to see a full set of online photos to show our families. Alicia was kind enough to provide a few of the best shots to use as our Thank You Card which turned out beautifully. All of the photos came out clear and so many details were captured. I am still getting compliments on how beautiful the photographs came out and I know these are something that we will cherish. Finally, Alicia and Garrett are very organized, so professional, and responsive with all of the emails before and after the wedding. They did exemplary work and we highly recommend them!

al and not over edited in a cheesy way, very romantic and mature. I cannot day enough about how in love I am with my photos. Not only did I get so many digital photos of my big day, but her communication before, during, and after was prompt and concise. She was thorough with asking what I was looking for, what poses I wanted ect, and delivered! She was great to work with during the wedding too, wasn’t “in the way” but still managed to get the job done. I recommend her to everyone and if I had to do it over again I would choose her again without a doubt!
