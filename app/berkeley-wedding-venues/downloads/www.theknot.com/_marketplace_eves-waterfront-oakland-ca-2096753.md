I had my wedding at Eve's Waterfront and it was absolutely amazing. The venue itself is stunning, with beautiful views and a spacious, elegant layout that created the perfect atm...

osphere for both our ceremony and reception. The food and drinks were outstanding. Several of our guests said it was the best food they've had at a wedding! The service was great from start to finish; the staff was attentive, professional, and made sure everything ran smoothly throughout the evening. What really made the experience unforgettable was working with Eve. She was incredibly organized, responsive and kind. She went above and beyond to support us during the planning process, answered every question, and made sure we felt confident and excited every step of the way. We couldn’t have asked for a better place to celebrate such a special occasion, and all of our guests commented on how beautiful and fun the evening was. I can’t recommend Eve’s Waterfront enough for a wedding or any special event!
