Brandi just doesn’t take photos, she captures the heart and soul of every moment! Right from the very start, her warmth, laughter, and the spark in her eyes created an environment ...

that was comfortable and fun on our wedding day. She allowed us to be fully present while she worked her magic behind the lens. Her professionalism was matched only by her passion, and her attention to detail brought our love story to life in the most breathtaking way. Every photo she delivered was beyond our expectations; filled with life, emotion, beauty, and memories we will treasure forever. If you are looking for someone to capture not only your moments but the feelings behind them, look no further than Brandi Rollins Photography. Beyond Grateful <3

Brandi was absolutely wonderful to work with! My now-husband is a hobbyist photographer who found Brandi online and really liked her style and portfolio. In our first consultation,...

she was easy to talk to and when we told her where our ceremony would be (in a clearing in a regional forest), she knew the exact spot and the best time for lighting. I'm shy about photos, but she is so good at calming nerves and making photo shoots fun. We did our engagement photos with her, and they came out so beautiful and authentically us! Our wedding album is just stunning. We will definitely use her again for anniversaries!

am THE most talented and professional photography team I’ve ever worked with they also are THE kindest. They were my personal hype women for my wedding. I have never felt so beautiful and looked so beautiful in photos before! The energy they brought to my wedding day was priceless and although the pictures were jaw droppingly beautiful (and I truly believe I couldn’t have gotten more beautiful photos) the energy & professionalism they brought was truly irreplaceable! They made our special day so incredibly stress free & fun. My partner and I are very camera shy but with Brandi and her team it felt so natural all day! Brandi and her team made it feel so relaxed and easy! However the PHOTOS!!! We are going to cherish every single photo Brandi and her team captured for many many years to come. I’m still stunned every time I look at them. I’m still in complete awe that those are my wedding photos!!! I cannot emphasis enough how talented Brandi and her team is. I’m in disbelief every time I look at my wedding photos because they are so extremely gorgeous!!!!!!! I literally cannot express how amazing they are!!!! Or how amazing Brandi is!!!! Brandi is the most precious human being in the world and we were so lucky to have her and her team by our side on our special day!!!

d brought absolute joy to our wedding and was very organized leading up to the big event. Multiple people commented that they've never seen a photographer work so hard and, indeed, she was making sure lighting was perfect (her assistant was carrying around huge props to make the magic happen), providing ample directions for people in group photos (she got my nephews to exhibit some wonderful smiles), AND was laughing and/or smiling the whole time. Our photos are a dream and she was absolutely worth every penny - oh and did I mention she offered to stay an extra hour (of which we willingly paid) on our wedding of her own volition? Brandi will be our go to for professional photos moving forward.

randi is thorough- she wants to get to know her couples and I love that. She’s super professional and easy to work with. She took the time to make sure we were all clear on expectations and boy did she deliver!! The day of, she brought the ENERGY! She was so fun to work with, we are laughing in most of our photos because we laughed with Brandi all day long! She put 100% into the day and we couldn’t be more happy with the product so far. Our teasers came within a couple of days from the wedding and my husband, our family, and I cannot stop looking at them. They are the best photos I’ve ever seen and we’re so happy our day was captured by Brandi. We chose Brandi because of the vibrant colorful photos in her website, because she captured joy and natural moments, and because we wanted a FUN vibe. If you’re looking for all of these things, you have to hire Brandi!

Married Dec 2024 in San Francisco – So my secret weapon was my photographer. I’d had the pleasure of working with Brandi during covid when my only child graduated from high school...

. I wanted a real photographer capturing a real “senior year” pic - not just the average ones from the high school. His pictures were stunning. I already knew Brandi had a knack for capturing those beautifully memorable but spontaneously unplanned moments and I knew she would do that with my wedding. I’m also not new to working with photographers. I have been in advertising and marketing as my career for over 30 years. I can’t count the photoshoots I’ve been on or the number of good and bad photographers I’ve worked with, so suffice it to say that I know a great photographer when I see one and I know working with them is just as important as what they produce. So as a second time 60-year-old bride, I can say I was not shy about being picky about who my photographer was going to be. I also knew from my first wedding (even though it was 30 years ago) that your photos are truly the only thing you really look at repeatedly AFTER the wedding. They are the single most important thing, which is capturing memories. And I knew I wanted Brandi’s version of capturing our wedding. She is not only amazingly talented, but she’s also thoughtful, considerate, professional, and funny. Her sense of humor makes all our photos where we’re laughing 100% genuine and not faked at all. I think it’s her laugh - hands down it is contagious. But at the end of the day, it’s all about the photos and hers speak for themselves. She is uniquely talented and creative. She has an eye for a specific moment. I truly can’t put my finger on it – even with my own professional background on the subject. It can only be described as transcending. And I’ve even worked with some world-famous photographers in my career. When they have it, they have it. You want her to capture your memories.

Brandi is a joy to work with and an incredibly talented photographer. We were initially drawn to her style and how she captures such genuine joy and vibrance in people and moments....

Leading up to the wedding, she made sure that she understood what our priorities were and what mattered most to us. On the day-of, Brandi and her assistant were on top of everything and did not miss a beat. They were both professional and fun, and they provided instruction and guidance when we needed it. We could not be more thrilled with our photos and how she managed to capture the most special moments with our family and friends!

We just got back some teaser photos and they're absolutely stunning, like they could be in a magazine. Thank you Brandi!

new Brandi was a great fit for us. Not only is Brandi a Pro at what she does, she's also so much fun/easy to work with. We've never taken professional photos before and had no clue on how to pose lol, so when it came to our wedding day Brandi made us feel super relaxed, she guided us through the entire photoshoot, made us laugh, and even hyped us up! Our wedding was at San Francisco City Hall and we shot at a 2nd location called Wayfare Tavern, and the photos came out so GORGEOUS (they belong in a magazine)! I highly recommend booking with Brandi, and would definitely work with her again.

to be around. I felt so comfortable talking to her and she took all of our ideas into considerations and also gave great guidance. You know you’re working with someone really great when they get excited while they’re working. And also a huge shout out to her assistant Jackie (I hope that’s right), she was so great and helpful. Everyone in my wedding party raved about how awesome the experience was. And even though most of us aren’t as comfortable in front of the camera, Brandi made it so easy and natural. I cannot recommend Brandi enough for anyone looking for a photographer for their special moments. She really is the best! Thank you again for capturing our day Brandi!

I cannot say enough good things about Brandi and her style. Everything started with the first call, she was the ONLY vendor of 12 to offer an initial Zoom call. That "30-minute" ca...

ll lasted 90-minutes with more laughter than my 'now-wife' and I experienced during COVID. After that call, I asked Brandi for sample albums. The first one she sent was just WAY too good. I asked for additional albums to which she sent 4-5 albums. I could not find a flaw in any of them. We quickly determined Brandi was the one! On the day of the wedding, Brandi was exceptional. She took very professional "planned photos" but during the ceremony, cocktail hour, and reception, she did an unbelievable job of not getting in the way of "moments". She was the hidden paparazzi during the entire evening, capturing moments we never even knew about (like the secretive inside joke she did with a few guests, photo was awesome)! We received our teaser photos and were BLOWN away by how good each photo was. Several of us in the wedding party have now converted our background photos on our phones to the photos that Brandi took. If you are considering Brandi, just DO IT! She is worth EVERY penny

Brandi was the photographer of our dreams. My wife and I had the bright idea to plan a "simple" backyard wedding in less than two months. I endlessly scrolled through photographe...

rs, until I landed on Brandi's profile. The pictures on her site were stunning and truly spoke to me. We were happy to learn that she was able to accommodate our last minute planning. When we spoke with her she gave us many valuable tips for how to plan, structure and set up for the day. She asked questions and offered suggestions for things that we had not taken into consideration. On the day of the wedding she was prompt and prepared. She was extremely, personable, gentle and directive, ensuring that we got in all of the types of photos that we requested, and ensuring that we looked great in the process. She made the kids laugh, corrected my horrible posture, and really made everyone feel safe and seen. She quickly sent us our "teaser photos." I was only expecting two receive a handful of photos but was pleased to find that she had sent over 3-4 dozen shots. We are beyond pleased with our photos and with the professional service that she provided from beginning to end. Book Brandi, you will not regret it!

I didn't expect to be reviewing a wedding vendor so quickly, but my fiancé and I just had a phenomenal experience with Brandi for our engagement shoot. We just received our teaser ...

photos and they came out a thousand times better than we could have ever hoped. We are so excited to work with her again for our wedding day. She has a keen eye for detail and guided us in our poses in such a warm and friendly way. She was always mindful of flattering angles and lighting that would never have crossed our mind given our inexperience. She's punctual, responsive, and incredibly professional and has absolutely been a highlight of our wedding planning experience so far. If you're starting to feel the pressures and stress of wedding planning, do yourself a solid and schedule a call with Brandi asap!! Your future self will thank you!

She is also a magician with lighting and can shoot any skin tone (we are in a biracial relationship). We can't recommend Brandi's work enough for engagement shoots, weddings, maternity photos, etc.
