Val is a photographer who believes that you and your partner are one of a kind, and she wants to preserve your naturally beautiful love story for the rest of time. Serving San Francisco, the East Bay, Napa, and beyond since 2015, she offers bespoke wedding photography experiences with an easy-going presence and a warm, personal approach. Her artistry and words have been described as intentional - like being held by a warm, cozy blanket. At each diverse celebration, she captures imagery with thoughtful care to tell your whole story. Her favorite thing is finding colorful details, but she also focuses on establishing shots, getting ready, first look, portraits, ceremony, reception, candid moments, and genuine connection. On the day of your wedding, she knows when to step up, gently give directions for portraits, and when to step back to capture those true-to-life moments. Her clients praise her professionalism, creativity, attention to detail, and reliability. She brings 110% to preparing for your special wedding day, so that you can enjoy the experience to the fullest. Every step of the way, from planning to delivery, you'll feel like you are a top priority. If you are still on the fence, no worries - the first step is a free planning consultation call. It's a helpful, no-pressure way to talk about your wedding day plans while getting to know each other. You and Val will talk through ideas, she will answer questions, and start shaping a vision together if you don't already have one. After you speak to Val, she will help design a custom wedding proposal for you to consider. Every custom proposal includes Val as the lead photographer, a collaborative photography timeline, a site visit, an online gallery with slideshow, easy download access, print, framed artwork, and an album store. You will receive your fabulous photos from Valarie Duran Photography within 6 to 10 weeks of the wedding day. Valarie Duran Photography is a wedding photography company based in Alameda, CA.

Valarie Duran

Owner

Today, Val photographs weddings and families with the purpose to create honest art that lasts, to help you preserve the laughter and connection of this season, and to ensure your children and grandchildren always have proof of how deeply they were loved. Every time she photographs a wedding, she sees more than portraits or details — she sees the start of a family’s story. And when she photographs families, she sees a couple growing stronger together, deepening their roots, and unfolding wonder with every messy chapter. Through her work, she hopes to give you the gift she once wished for: tangible proof of your lifetime — the love, the laughter, and the in-between moments that will one day mean everything to everyone you call home. She is an Alameda, California based photographer, big sister, mom, and creative at heart. Her approach blends warmth, organization, thoughtful direction, and an eye for detail. Whether she’s photographing a wedding in the redwoods, at an estate, or at the beach her goal is always the same: to help you feel comfortable, seen, and beautifully represented. Over the last 10 years, she's traveled to 12 destinations around the world for photography projects. She holds a B.A. degree in Media Studies from University of San Francisco and a M.A. degree from New York University’s Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development. When she's not behind the camera or exploring the world, you’ll often find her pouring her heart into her little one Dylan. Photography has been more than just an artistic expression. It’s been a journey to healing, a gratitude practice, and a source of joy.

he took the time to understand what we wanted and created a clear proposal accordingly. She also took the time to do location scouting and knew exactly what pictures she wanted to take. She had a whole timeline prepared for us and made sure all our preferences and concerns were heard. She also sent us the sneak peeks and the pictures right on time as she promised. And also followed up promptly with a few follow up requests.We cannot recommend her enough!! Thank you so much Valerie for capturing this day SO BEAUTIFULLY!
