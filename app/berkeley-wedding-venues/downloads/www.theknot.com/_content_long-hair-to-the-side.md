You can opt for a timeless and romantic look, like side-swept Hollywood waves, or you can go for something a bit more polished and sleek, like a [wedding updo](https://www.theknot.com/content/updos-for-long-hair) with a deep side part.

## Is Side-Swept Hair Right for My Wedding Look?

When it's time to [choose a wedding hairstyle](https://www.theknot.com/content/choosing-a-wedding-day-hairstyle), you want to make sure that the idea you have in your head actually works with your gown, venue, and overall wedding vibe or theme. It's hard to go wrong with a side-swept hairstyle—since it can be up, down, and done with long hair, short hair or bangs, it's a fairly versatile look. That said, there are some things to keep in mind to make sure it's right for you.

### Consider the Style of Your Wedding Gown 

The best [wedding hairstyles](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-hairstyles-you-will-love) mesh perfectly with the bride's gown. Again, bridal side-swept hairstyles are pretty versatile, but you still want to make sure it works with your dress. "The hairstyle you choose harmoniously pairs with your overall look; it's about creating balance," explains [Haven Whiteman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/havensierra/), hairstylist and extension expert. "The best way to decide if your hairstyle suits your wedding look is to consider the neckline, structure, lines and details of your dress." 

FEATURED VIDEO FROM THE KNOT

Certain dress styles will naturally work better with certain types of side-swept hairstyles. "Side-swept waves pair beautifully with asymmetrical necklines, strapless gowns or off-the-shoulder designs," says Angela Calisti, celebrity hairstylist and owner of [Beauty Social Salon](https://www.beautysocialsalon.com/) in Astoria, New York. "A deep side part is perfect for dresses with dramatic structure, high neckline or bold shoulders, as it softens the look and adds a bit of edge without overpowering the dress." And if your gown features intricate details on the back or an open back, Calisti notes that pulling your hair to the front and side is a nice way to show that off. 

### Make Sure It Works With Your Makeup

Hair and makeup should always complement each other. "No matter what, you want everything to look cohesive, and it needs to be practical," Whiteman says. "Remember to choose a hairstyle that doesn't compete or distract from your beautiful makeup." For example, Calisti notes that if your makeup is bolder, opt for a softer hairstyle to bring some harmony to your look. If your makeup is more natural, she recommends a more defined or styled hairstyle. 

### Ensure the Hairstyle Complements the Wedding Vibe 

You might not think your venue has anything to do with your hairstyle, but it should. When picking a hairstyle, think about all aspects of your wedding, from the location to the potential weather. "If you're having a beach wedding, you'll want a hairstyle that can survive spontaneous coastal wind and heat from potential direct sunlight," Whiteman explains. If that's the case, she recommends something like a side-swept braid. Similarly, if your wedding is at a very formal ballroom with a black-tie dress code, Calisti recommends sleek glam, like a side-swept updo. 

### Stay True to Your Personal Style and Comfort Level 

Your wedding is not really the time to experiment with a hairstyle you would normally never think about trying. "Pick something that feels like you," Calisti says. "You'll be wearing this style all day, so comfort and confidence are key." Whiteman agrees, noting that it's important to be practical about your look. "Your hairstyle needs to withstand the endless hugs, photos and dancing," she says. If you're the type of bride who doesn't want one hair out of place, be sure to pick a style that won't budge. 

### Always Do a Hair Trial 

If you're still unsure whether or not a bridal side-swept hairstyle is right for you on your wedding day, then make sure to try it out with a [hair trial](https://www.theknot.com/content/prep-for-hair-and-makeup-trial). "This is always recommended to curate the best look for your big day," Calisti notes. Have your [wedding hairstylist](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/beauty-services) take some photos as well to see how it looks on camera. 

### Find your kind of venue

From barns to ballrooms, discover reception venues that feel like you.

## Our Favorite Side-Swept Wedding Hair Ideas 

Picking a side-swept hairstyle for your wedding day comes down to selecting a look that works well with your dress, makeup and even your wedding venue. "The style you choose depends on the aesthetic and energy you're looking to embody," Whiteman says. Here are a few options to choose from. 

### 1\. Soft Waves With Side Part 

![Soft waves with side part wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/0a2d39d4-dcf4-40f9-8ff7-bb266cf6ae92~rs_768.h-cr_0.165.1094.1624)

_Photo: Trene Forbes Photography,__Hairstylist: Hair by McDiva_

Soft, long waves are simple, classic and always stunning—you really can't go wrong with them. Calisti calls them "sleek, polished and perfect for a modern yet vintage-inspired bride." Add a glittering hair brooch or accessory at the side part for a little extra glam. 

### 2\. Side-Swept Low Ponytail 

![Side-swept low ponytail wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/37921dac-6741-45f9-be40-4667f1c0b8f3~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1967.1475)

_Photo: Terence Tan Photography,__Hairstylist: Bernard Bridal Make-Up_

Low ponytails are an underrated bridal hairstyle. They are simple and low-key, but can look put together and sophisticated when done right. One way to make a low ponytail feel fancy is to pull it to the side a bit and let it cascade over one shoulder. Adding a fun hair clip that ties into your dress also makes it feel more special. 

### 3\. Deep Side Part With Hair Clip

![Deep side part with hair clip wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/21c50c6e-6639-4243-b501-a04fb2aa3cdc~rs_768.h-cr_61.0.1033.729)

_Photo: Steph Grant Photography,__Hairstylist: Andria Tobey Hair_

Opt for vintage-inspired glam with long, soft waves and a deep side part. This adds a little volume, keeps the waves looking interesting, and feels special for your wedding day. A sparkling hair clip right over your ear accentuates your side part wedding hair. 

### 4\. Soft Blowout and Side Part 

![Soft blowout and side part wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/769795c7-e031-4a62-b76c-087e920abdb6~rs_768.h-cr_0.79.1094.1538)

_Photo: Steph G Bishop,__Hairstylist: Kayla Weathers Makeup_

If you want to keep your side do wedding hairstyle simple and uncomplicated, you can do a blowout that includes soft waves or curls, like this one. Instead of a statement hair accessory, wear large statement earrings that will stand out as your hair moves naturally. 

### 5\. Glamorous Curls With Side Part

![Glamorous curls with side part wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/a9c998dc-ce94-4147-a4c9-636be37866ae~rs_768.h-cr_34.0.1059.1367)

_Photo: Stanlo Photography,__Hairstylist: Dommie Cole Brand_

If there was ever a time to go full Hollywood glam with voluminous, luxurious curls, your wedding day would be it. These side-swept curls are great for brides with long or medium-length hair, and adding a side part instead of a middle part gives it a vintage vibe. 

### 6\. Soft Curls Pinned to the Side 

![Soft curls pinned to the side wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/43be489b-dc9f-41ce-9531-c55ff45a6a34~rs_768.h-cr_69.0.1094.1367)

_Photo: Stanlo Photography,__Hairstylist: Dommie Cole Brand_

"Soft curls pinned to one side offer a beautiful profile moment, especially with statement earrings," Calisti says. This look is a great example of that, and also shows that these glamorous curls can look just as great with a statement hair accessory. 

### 7\. Dramatic Side-Swept Updo

![Dramatic side swept updo wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/7ab9dff2-716a-40d1-9bdd-64583678b5c0~rs_768.h-cr_26.0.1051.1367)

_Photo: Stanlo Photography,__Hairstylist: Charis Hair_

This is a beautiful example of side-updo wedding hair. It includes curls, sleek and shiny locks, and a deep side part, and it lets you really show off your gown. The best part is the swooping side bang that makes this look vintage-inspired. 

### 8\. Shoulder Length Side-Swept Waves 

![Shoulder length side-swept waves wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/d425b1fd-985c-40a3-844a-7dfe2fb66c0f~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1094.1458)

_Photo: Sara Bishop Photography,__Hairstylist: Le Beige Beauty_

You don't have to have long hair to do side-swept waves. When your hair is medium length or hits right at your shoulders, this hairstyle and a deep side part can really allow the details of your gown to shine. It's perfect for a bride who wants to do something elegant but not too structured.

### 9\. Long, Soft Waves With Side Part

_Photo: Rene Zadori Photography,__Hairstylist: Elwynn + Cass Beauty Concierge Service_

Soft, brushed-out waves with a deep side part are such a perfect bridal look. As Whiteman notes, it's also a perfect [hairstyle for a strapless dress](https://www.theknot.com/content/hairstyles-for-strapless-dresses), since it helps draw attention to the neckline and collarbones. 

### 10\. Voluminous Side-Swept Curls 

![Voluminous side-swept curls wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/b9fe8373-72ca-4bc6-a396-6eb7a81ea443~rs_768.h-cr_0.179.1094.1638)

_Photography: Monisa J Photography,__Hairstylist: In Favor of Style_

Let your natural hair texture stand out with this simple hairstyle. The deep side part adds a little more volume, and with side curls like these, you really don't need any hair accessories. This looks beautiful with longer or medium-length hair. 

### 11\. Side Part With Sparkly Hair Clip 

![Side part with sparkly hair clip wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/a804616a-c2db-4963-9bcf-d07f00e4517b~rs_768.h-cr_0.185.1094.1644)

_Photo: Maura Jane Photography,__Hairstylist: A Salon Santa Fe_

It can be hard to figure out how to incorporate a hair accessory you love into a hairdo to the side. Side-swept waves allow you to place a hair clip directly above your exposed hair, allowing it to have its moment in photos and in person. 

### 12\. Long, Loose Blowout With Side Part

![Long, loose blowout with side part wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/1d18ae7e-8617-4919-a382-86c5a3c99488~rs_768.h-cr_0.25.1080.1465)

_Photo: Kyle John Photography,__Hairstylist: Salon Tullio_

A fantastic blowout can be more than enough to make your wedding day beauty look stand out. That's especially true if you pair it with a side part, which adds extra volume and creates a beautiful shape. 

### 13\. Side Part With Short Hair 

![Side part with short hair wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/035f56b4-d19c-474f-971a-dbc66330dc8c~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1331.1775)

_Photo: Kamarin Ann Photo_

Don't be mistaken: You can definitely do a side-swept wedding hairstyle with a short and cute bob cut. Opt for a deep side part, add some wave or texture to your hair, and to top things off, place a small hair clip or accessory right above your exposed ear. Just make sure the accessory isn't too big, as you don't want it to take over. 

### 14\. Sleek and to the Side 

![Sleek and to the side wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/d7040648-9d67-4241-85bb-6ff2735b96fb~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1094.1459)

_Photo: Josh & Dana Fernandez,__Hairstylist: Sean Dapper Studio_

Side hairstyles for a wedding are often done with soft waves or curls, but you don't need texture to make them work. You can leave your hair straight and sleek for a more modern hairstyle that is very chic. 

### 15\. Side-Swept Hair With Slight Wave

![Side swept hair with slight wave wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/0986afec-6c97-44b6-8e13-98e07b3cebe9~rs_768.h-cr_0.181.1094.1640)

_Photo: Jessica Yvonne Photo,__Hairstylist: Make up by Dion_

You don't have to go for full-on side-swept Hollywood waves for your wedding hair. This bride is an example of that: She has just a slight wave in her hair that makes this feel a bit more special. 

### 16\. Side Waves With Middle Part

![Side waves with middle part wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/a4c27aba-d19a-4c00-a218-653a2cdbceea~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1094.1459)

_Photo: Jeremy Chou Photography_

Believe it or not, a deep side part is not necessary in order to get a side-swept hairstyle. This bride shows how you can achieve the look even with a middle part. Simply pull your hair off one shoulder and to the side—add some subtle pins if you don't want to have to move it all night long. 

### 17\. Twisted Side-Swept Style 

![Twisted side-swept hairstyle for wedding](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/1a58212b-248f-4017-8c77-e6a435b6861e~rs_768.h-cr_0.44.1094.1503)

Adding a little twist to your hairstyle can make it feel more unique and modern. This bride's hairstyle to the side features a side-swept look with a few pieces twisted back and a dazzling rhinestone hair clip right above the exposed ear. 

### 18\. Side-Swept Pixie Cut 

![Side-swept pixie cut wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/5935d406-3ce1-4abf-80d3-9a6eaf0e897b~rs_768.h-cr_0.182.1094.1641)

_Photo: Jasmine Ruiz,__Hairstylist: Moonlight Glamour_

One gorgeous way to style a pixie cut or very short haircut is to add a deep side part. It's simple, elegant and understated. Slicking back the hair a bit is one way to make this side style hairstyle for a wedding feel even more modern. 

### 19\. Side Part With Extensions 

![Side part with extensions wedding hairstylist](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/9216ee6d-7be6-412f-9dd5-a421051bd5dc~rs_768.h-cr_0.89.1331.1864)

_Photo: Janey Pakpahan Photography,__Hairstylist: Nine Zero One Salon_

Hair extensions are a great way to add a little something to a simple side part and blowout. "Extensions are one of bridal's best-kept secrets to achieving Pinterest-perfect hairstyles, especially for side-swept looks where fullness on one side is key," Whiteman says. 

### 20\. Full Curls With a Side Part

![Full curls with side part wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/b1fd0538-8f9c-4b06-ae81-a7d31d70a485~rs_768.h-cr_0.202.1458.1660)

Opt for tons of volume with full, soft curls and a side part. You can achieve the curls with a wide barrel curling iron, then comb them out for a more romantic look. If you need some added fullness, some clip-in extensions can do the trick. 

### 21\. Low Bun With Swooping Bangs

![Low bun with swooping bangs wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/78a4e1a2-7dd6-4697-8031-2b08c52e14ae~rs_768.h-cr_61.0.1033.729)

_Photography: Iris Mannings Photography,__Hairstylist: Hair by MicDiva_

Side updos for weddings are so pretty and sophisticated. This low bun, with a swooping side bang and glittery hair accessory, is a fun and modern take on a classic look. The S-shaped hair clip works with the shape of the hairstyle as well. 

### 22\. Half-Up With a Flower Crown

![Half-up with flower crown wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/5996aadf-3fcf-4271-876f-0d46228f06f8~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1094.1459)

_Photo: Hetler Photography_

Turn a half-up hairstyle into a side-swept one by simply pulling all of your hair down to one side of your head. This look is romantic and bohemian thanks to some twisted back pieces and the addition of a pretty flower crown. 

### 23\. Side Part With a Twist

![Side part with twist wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/e4d6c894-e0c1-4dad-8b0c-90f669abbecd~rs_768.h-cr_0.89.1331.1864)

_Photo: Haleigh Nicole Photography,__Hairstylist: Onsite Muse Hairstylists and Airbrush Makeup_

This simple hairstyle looks so pretty, especially with a less formal wedding gown. Start with a side part, then twist back the hair on one side into a look that is similar to a small French braid. Add some floral hair accessories or accents for a bohemian look. 

### 24\. Side Part and Beach Waves

![Side part and beach waves wedding hairstylist](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/265821e2-569c-47df-80b5-9c9f50f9935f~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1094.1458)

Beach waves may feel casual, but when done right, they can definitely have a bridal vibe to them that feels special enough for a formal dress. Loose, shiny beach waves look especially great with a side part for added volume. 

### 25\. Natural Curls With a Side Clip

![Natural curls with side clip wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/f26022b6-25fc-4f97-a679-c72a87cb7fed~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1094.1459)

_Photo: Felicia V Photography,__Hairstylist: Kiara Shannelle_

Embrace your natural hair texture and opt for big, voluminous curls. You can leave your hair as is, but another option that elevates the look a bit is to add a sparkling hair clip on the side of your part. 

### 26\. Low Side Chignon 

![Low side chignon wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/e4150015-9e38-4d7d-9221-fb58daa2356a~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1331.1775)

_Photography: Fabi Rosas Cabo Wedding Photographer,__Hairstylist: Piel Canela Makeup_

Opt for classically beautiful and romantic with a low chignon that is swept to the side. "This is perfect for the elegant and sophisticated bride, and is ideal for formal weddings or dresses with clean lines," Calisti says. 

### 27\. Side Part Updo With a Crown

![Side part updo with crown wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/8cac164c-7dd9-464c-bc7a-dee9429cc29d~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1094.1459)

_Photography: Eve Rox Photography,__Hairstylist: Girl Meets Bongga_

A side part can make a simple updo a little bit more interesting. Pull out some tendrils of hair around your face and, to really make things unique, add a show-stopping hair accessory. A gold crown or tiara does the trick. 

### 28\. Low Side Bun With a Twist

![Low side bun with twist wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/5b257c79-125c-4265-bdeb-7bb68c1767d3~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1094.1458)

_Photography: Ether & Smith,__Hairstylist: Chiali Meng_

An updo is the best way to keep hair off your shoulders and out of your face the entire day and night. This soft, low bun, featuring hair that is gently twisted back and set to the side, is romantic and so beautiful. 

### 29\. Side Updo With Curls 

![Side updo with curls wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/32fdb7f6-fa5c-4ea2-a716-37543e6449e4~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1331.1775)

_Photography: Ellie McKinney Photography,__Hairstylist: Taji Natural Hair_

Show off your hair texture with a pretty updo like this one. You can do a deep side part to give it a little bit of a vintage feel. A sparkling, floral hair accessory over the low bun or twist makes this extra special. 

### 30\. Curls With a Side Pin 

![Curls with side pin wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/14c2b071-b6c5-46f3-bb45-7ebd0efc2328~rs_768.h-cr_53.0.1062.1345)

For a full-on glam look, opt for big, beautiful curls, dramatic eye makeup and a deep side part. You can make the look even more luxe by adding a bejeweled hair clip right over an exposed ear to keep some of the hair out of your face. 

### 31\. Soft Curls Pinned to One Side 

![Soft curls pinned to the side wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/b437a2f6-7312-4b59-acff-ea00d33c993c~rs_768.h-cr_0.91.1094.1550)

"Soft curls pinned to one side offer a beautiful profile moment, especially with statement earrings," Calisti says. A pearl bobby pin or clip is a really nice way to hold your hair back on one side. 

### 32\. Deep Side Part With Curls

Pairing a more low-key hairstyle with a formal gown and wedding venue can create an interesting contrast. This is a good example of simple but elegant: long, loose curls with a deep side part for volume. 

### 33\. Front Hair Slicked Back

Opt for a more trendy and modern hairstyle with this look. The front of your hair is slicked back, with a side part instead of a middle part, while the rest is curled and voluminous. Brushed out curls make this even more glam. 

### 34\. Side Clip With Bangs

This hairstyle option is perfect for someone with shorter hair and bangs. Add some texture with curls or waves, then place a clip right over one ear to create a pinned-back look. 

### 35\. Side Ponytail

Don't sleep on a bridal ponytail—Calisti calls a side-swept low pony effortless and chic and notes that it's great as a garden or [beach wedding hair](https://www.theknot.com/content/beach-wedding-hair-ideas). This style includes a side part and some tendrils that frame the face for a romantic look.
