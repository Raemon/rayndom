Tara Ybarra

Owner

I started honing in on weddings in 2002. I loved contributing to a day that important, and making people happy. Throughout the years I work as a photographer, cake decorator, and florist. Finally, I realized I wanted to be involved in all of it. With my combined passions for planning, organizing, crafting, and decorating, I realized Wedding Planning is my dream job! I went to school for it, became a certified wedding planner, and my husband and I opened Ybarra Events! We absolutely love our jobs and couldn't be happier to make everyone else's wedding day stress-free and wonderful.

We got married almost a couple months ago and have been waiting for things to settle down a bit so we could be sure to give Tara a great review. Although we hired her as our "month...

of" planner, she was more than helpful since the day we met her on our zoom call a year prior. She worked with us on ways we could save money, alternative ideas to the standard traditional wedding and offered advice whenever it was needed. We never felt like we were a bother when reaching out and she was always so prompt in her responses. In the days leading up to the wedding, she made sure everyone was on the same page between us, family, vendors, wedding party etc. On wedding day, we had multiple people come up to us and praise how well the timeline was put together and how everything flowed together so well. We highly recommend Tara if you are looking for a planner and we promise you won't be disappointed! Thank you Tara <3

I don't even really know where to start! Tara is absolutely amazing. She was helpful from day one. I connected with her in January 2025 I believe, for a November 2025 wedding. She ...

was willing to work with our budget, she was so quick to answer all of our questions, we was extremely helpful in recommending vendors. She has such a calming presence to her that any time I chatted with her my stress just melted away. She is highly organized and very professional. We were so thankful to have found Tara and can't express our gratitude enough. We wouldn't have had as beautiful of a wedding as we did if it weren't for Tara. HIRE HER TO MAKE YOUR LIFE EASIER! She is amazing.

I cannot thank or recommend Tara from Ybarra Events enough for bringing to life the wedding of our dreams! She brings with her a wealth of experience, genuine compassion, patience,...

and an infectious calmness, which I personally feel is crucial to wedding planning! She is a true wedding visionary. I didn't know where to start with the whole planning process, but she helped us every step of the way! We hired her for the "month-of", but she gives you the tools you need upfront (in our case about a year in advance) and checks in and is available to make sure you're where you need to be. I feel my review is doing her a disservice as I can't sing her praises enough. Tara is a true gem through and through! Do not hesitate to work with her for your future event planning needs.

As a May 2025 bride, I was in search of a month of coordinator who was also familiar with our Napa venue. After speaking with several planners, we landed on Heather at Ybarra Event...

s. Although she was technically only "month of", she provided open communication and vendor recommendations straight away in addition to conducting a venue walkthrough and formal menu tasting with the event and catering coordinator. Additionally, we had a few longer meetings in the last couple months leading up to the wedding which made sure every detail was in place and all questions were answered. Heather was fantastic on the day and was very hands on with setup/breakdown, ceremony pacing, and late night details that are often forgotten. She was so sweet throughout the entire process and I'm grateful we were able to work together for this very important occasion that went off without a hitch. Thank you!

or our wedding, but she took the time to get to know us and help us find a happy medium. I was also going to school at the time, so I couldn't (and didn't) want to plan my wedding but couldn't afford to have someone do it all for me. Her different options for weddings helped me find a good tier for us to work with. Working with her was a delight. She was knowledge, patient, organized, and I felt very comfortable working with her. She took the stress away! If I ever have a big event in my life again, I will definitely be reaching out to her.

nd advice. I was so grateful to have Tara to email throughout the wedding planning process. Our wedding in Fairfax was a destination wedding so being so far away can make things feel scary, but Tara's support and advice brought us so much comfort and ease. Tara is very evidently experienced and knowledgable in her field, because she reminded me of things I never thought about and gave me referrals to other vendors as needed. I also loved the planning website that she gave us access to because it helped keep me on schedule during planning. Lastly, Tara is so sweet and friendly. We enjoyed working with her and my family & friends commented on how kind, organized, and calm she was throughout the wedding day. She truly made me feel like everything was taken care of throughout our wedding day and she stayed until everyone was gone. THANK YOU TARA! We could not have done this without you.

We had the pleasure of working with Heather Bair from Ybarra Events as our "month of" wedding planner for our October 2023 wedding. Heather's expertise and professionalism in event...

planning were evident from the start. She brought a level of organization and foresight that was both reassuring and impressive, making it clear that we could trust her to execute our vision flawlessly. Despite the inherent stress of wedding planning, Heather's methodical approach significantly eased our worries. Her communication was clear and effective, utilizing a mix of emails, planned zoom calls, texts and wedding planning tools to plan and orchestrate our big day. Heather's knack for asking essential questions, ones we hadn't thought to ask ourselves, was particularly invaluable. This attention to detail ensured that every aspect of our wedding was considered and carefully planned, and wow did all that work pay off! On the wedding day, Heather's management was extraordinary. She operated like a well-oiled machine, providing support and efficiently handling every event detail. She communicated effectively, involving us in decisions as needed while smoothly keeping the day on track. We wholeheartedly recommend Heather Bair at Ybarra Events to any couple seeking a skilled and personable wedding planner. Her invaluable contribution to our wedding was deeply appreciated, and we would gladly choose Heather and Ybarra Events for any future event planning needs.

Tara was exactly the perfect wedding coordinator for us! In addition to her attention to detail, her calm presence, and her ability to anticipate our needs before we even knew them...

, she was an awesome person to spend our wedding day with. When starting the wedding planning process, we were looking for a day-of wedding planner. We knew we wanted to choose our venue, caterer, and DJ on our own, but since we were planning our Sonoma wedding (Viansa Sonoma) from across the country, we knew we needed someone to help us with the small details. Little did we know after hiring Tara that we would be getting so much more than that! From our first meeting, you could tell that she was incredibly professional but also an easy person to talk to. She set down the expectations from a "month-of wedding planner," but let us know that we could email her with any questions or help with decisions like which of two florists we were deciding between. She was always prompt to her responses and had check in's just to make sure we were on track. She was one of the best decisions we made for planning our wedding, and the day wouldn't have gone nearly as smoothly without her!

Ybarra Events was recommended by our venue and we are absolutely blessed that we hired them to plan our wedding. We worked with Tara, who is the kindest soul and a true mastermind ...

at her job. Even though we only hired Tara to be our month-of planner, she worked with us closely over the course of the year leading up to the big event. I was largely developing my plan, decorations, etc, but she was ALWAYS available anytime I needed help or advice. Tara assisted me in suggesting reliable vendors, brainstorming fun ideas, working out reasonable logistics and set us up with the Aisle Planner software. She was an absolute godsend and that was amplified multitudes the day of the wedding! We 110% recommend you work with them for your wedding, you will not be disappointed. Come wedding day, I know despite being cool as a cucumber in most scenarios- I'm also a bit type A when I have a vision to create. Trusting the process, I brought all the things I had prepared to the venue and Tara did the rest. Well, Tara knocked it out of the ballpark. My jaw hit the floor when I showed up that afternoon to see that she had executed our vision to perfection and helped coalesce our dream wedding into a reality far exceeding our expectations.

Where d o I get started when describing this experience of planning a wedding with Tara…I suppose from the start. Right from the get go and initial introductory call, we knew she w...

as the right planner for us. We had a long runway to plan our wedding (over a year), and Tara was by our side at every corner. She helped us plan a fusion Indian-Western wedding and was diligent about details (which I appreciated so much!). She worked closely with our selected vendors to chase down enquiries, make changes to our vision etc. When it was closer to the wedding, we realised that it would rain on the day and Tara was an absolute star about it. From various contingency plans with associated seating and table arrangements, to discussing what we may want to buy to deal with the weather and so much more, she was on it!! On the day, I can’t even begin to describe how well she coordinated the vendors (it felt so seamless even though we needed to flip an indoor space multiple times during the day to accommodate the events). Tara, a massive thank you from Matt and Sinduja and our family for helping make our big day so special!!! You are an amazing person and incredibly skilled at what you do, and I’m so glad our paths crossed!!

t our home in the wine country. Heather helped me from beginning to end. I had never held a large event at our property and was stressed about having to bring in everything. Heather kept me calm and made the process fun. She helped with the layout, the vendors and the setup. The day of the event she made certain everything ran smoothly from start to finish. I received many compliments from our guests on how well the event was organized. I have never enjoyed myself more at a party that I have thrown. When Heather showed up the morning of the event, she told me to go and relax. I had time to unwind and get ready for the event. She set up the entire venue with her assistant and made sure all the other vendors knew their responsibilities. Once the event began, she kept me on schedule with speeches and transitions from cocktails to dinner etc. I got to spend time with our guests and truly enjoy the day. I would highly recommend Heather to anyone planning a large or small event. Heather is very organized and calm. She was an absolute pleasure to work with and I will be hiring her again for any future events. Thank you Heather!!

a new venue and a new planner. Tara was incredibly flexible from the start- she even adapted her normal plans to match what our previous planner was doing! Throughout the whole process, and especially given the craziness with COVID, Tara was so supportive & really put our minds at ease. We loved working with her so much that we asked her to coordinate our rehearsal/welcome drinks as well! She went above and beyond to make the weekend as easy as possible, including taking the items we DIYed for the wedding the night before so we didn't have to find a way to bring them to the venue. Despite these crazy times, our whole event went off perfectly and we couldn't be happier. Thank you so much, Tara!

via zoom and her input on weddings was so helpful. She made my wedding day smooth and stress-free. We had so many last-minute changes because of COVID and she was flexible and made everything work. We didn’t have to worry about anything from the day we hired her. Tara was always at every meeting early and ready to work with questions and answers on hand. She made me realize a lot of wedding details that I did not even know I had to think about. We recommend YBARRA EVENTS 100%!!! IT DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER THAN THIS ONE. Everyone had a good time at our wedding! I had a lot of my wedding party talk to me about how wonderful Tara and James are. They were prepared and took care of the things that I did not even know till after the wedding! GO WITH YBARRA EVENTS!

s always there to recommend vendors and make sure we weren't missing key events or details. Keep in mind, we hadn't paid for a full planning experience, but she was still always ready to help along the journey. She made the day-of timeline (crucial!) and a beautiful model of the set-up that was used by all the vendors. I think we went with almost all of her recommended vendors and they were all incredibly friendly and fun to work with. I was most interested in day-of coordination because I wanted my mom and bridesmaids to be able to relax. Right on time, Tara was there and making things run smoothly! There were plenty of little weather related snafus and other things that couldn't have been planned for in advance. But I didn't even hear of them until a week after the wedding, and I don't think any guests noticed at all! The set up and coordination between staff were seamless, no awkward pauses during events. People literally said it was the best wedding they'd ever been to- including my uncle who's own daughter was literally getting married the next month. Definitely consider Tara for your day-of coordination, and I can't even imagine how wonderful she would be at the bigger planning packages!

On the day of the wedding, there were a few snafus with some of our vendors (as with any planned event, no doubt!) and Tara and her team handled them all wonderfully. We barely even noticed that there was any confusion to begin with, which we credit to Tara and her team. Everything was handled with such professionalism, even during a year that was undoubtedly incredibly stressful for all wedding vendors. Do yourself a favor and hire these incredibly kind and competent people to help you plan your wedding. You will not regret it!

Her quiet efficiency impressed not only me at the wedding reception but also several of our guests that commented to me on her competency. Every time in the 8 months of planning this wedding that I reached out to Tara, she answered quickly and knowledgeably. Planning this wedding from a distance turned out not to be a chore with Tara's help. She gave us a heads up on a problem vendor we had hired and quickly recommended another saving us some major frustration and not to mention, money. I cannot think of one thing negative about Tara. You absolutely cannot go wrong hiring her. My daughter and I both are missing her. She had become one of the family!! With deep appreciation, thank you Tara!

Oh my goodness, where to start? Our wedding was a wonderful 3 -day event that we couldn’t have possibly pulled off without the amazing Tara Ybarra! We chose Tara as our wedding pl...

anner because of her terrific competence, because of the care that she so clearly gives to all of her projects, and because it seemed that she would just “get” what we wanted and needed. It had come down to a choice between 2 excellent planners, but we made the right choice. Tara’s personal attention, love and creativity went way above and beyond what we imagined. First of all, Tara works really hard. She was there for us, no matter when we called, or what we asked, and was never too busy to talk with us. Second of all, Tara knows a lot about weddings, and she directed us to the most attentive, available vendors (e.g., caterers, florists, etc.) in the area, and a number of them give her discounts which we wouldn’t have had access to otherwise. Third of all, she helped us create whatever we thought of, such as a novel seating arrangement at the ceremony, or working with our family who helped plan our rehearsal dinner picnic, and then she brought her husband and daughters to join us to help, and purchased flowers and great lighting for Friday night’s fabulous evening of pre wedding festivities. Fourth of all, she was so calm and well organized about the whole planning process, even when we were getting frazzled. I tried to wrap most calls by asking her, “Tara, where are we getting behind?” And she would calmly tell us what needed to get done, and by when, and then compliment us that we were doing great. Fifth of all, she was so fabulous to work with. I don’t think we had even a whisper of a cross word with each other in the almost year of planning the events. And finally, on the day of the wedding, she had it so together. She was the first one at the venue and the last one to leave. Through a lot of hard work and some good fortune, the events we planned came off almost without a hitch, but there is always something unexpected that happens, and when they did, Tara took care of them without even telling us. We actually feel like Tara is family and miss her already, 3 weeks after our wedding, and hope to connect soon to recap and remember the great weekend.

nner for our wedding in Sonoma in August 2018. Planning a wedding in CA from the East Coast can be daunting, but Tara was always able to make us feel at ease. Here is why she is amazing: Professionalism: She carries herself with a warm passion for her work that inspires trust and confidence in her ability. Timeliness: She responds promptly to all communications. Effort: She consistently went above and beyond to fulfill our needs and requests no matter how complicated or trivial. Organization: She did not make a single mistake. All pre-planning was done on-time and correctly, and the wedding day went off without a hiccup. Connections: She has great relationships with some of the best vendors! It was a huge relief and in hindsight a big selling point for us. People are still telling us that we had the best venue, food and dessert of any wedding they have ever attended.

My now husband and I started wedding planning about 1 year before our wedding date in April 2018. We found Tara via online search and previous reviews. The reviews caught my attent...

ion because they painted a picture of someone who was organized, down-to-earth, responsible, easy-going, and attentive to detail. And after looking at her website and service packages, quite affordable for the area. Our wedding was in Kenwood, CA. Sure enough, after our phone interview with Tara, we knew we wanted to go with her. We interviewed a total of 4 planners and the others did not give us the sense that they had time to explain to us about everything that they are about as a wedding planner. Tara spent the time to answer every single one of our questions, and she pointed out lots of important points to consider that we as first-time wedding planners did not think about. Our first meeting with Tara was at the venue, and she was kind, sweet, down-to-earth (just as we picture from the phone call), and we knew that we'd make a great team. We picked a package that was an in-between of a full planner and a day-of coordinator. We wanted to still do our own research to find our vendors and design the look of our wedding, but we wanted to be able to ask questions and have guidance whenever needed. Tara fit the role perfectly. She has experience in almost every field of the wedding industry--She used to help make wedding cakes, she used to do wedding flowers, etc, so she is really knowledgeable with just about anything wedding-related. She thinks broadly and ahead of the game--she has umbrellas ready to bring in case of change in weather, she has a sewing kit in case of any wardrobe malfunction. Tara was responsive even in the midst of busy wedding season for her, and although sometimes she may need to take some days to focus on the other weddings in the immediate future, she never made us feel that we were left in the dark and she always kept us up-to-date on when she anticipated that she'd be more busy. Tara helped us place the floral/foliage orders for the banquet table centerpiece, and she helped us put them together! We were able to save some $ this way. We had a budget that we wanted to stick to, and Tara was very helpful in staying within this range. Tara's husband assists her for the day of the wedding, and they made a great team and put together the decor very nicely. All of our vendors commented on what a pleasure it was to work with Tara. We highly recommend her!

If you are a bride on the fence about whether or not you need a wedding coordinator or who you should get, just stop what you are doing and call Tara! She is absolutely incredible!...

I had been unsure of if I needed a coordinator or not, but looking back, I could not have done it without her! I did not know it was possible to love a complete stranger this much after working with them for one event! She literally did everything (and more) possible to make me and my now husband feel like VIP guests at our own wedding reception instead of worrying about hosting logistics and problems that inevitably come up. And this is how it should be! Our wedding day was perfect and looking back over the blur of happiness, everything for our 250 people reception happened seamlessly. All thanks to Tara! It was such an amazing feeling to be able to trust the event - one of the most important events my husband and I will ever put on - in Tara's capable hands. She went above and beyond on everything. She is extremely quick to communicate with, extremely organized, makes sure she completely understands what you want and then executes it perfectly. Brides - do yourself a favor and get Tara and her husband James to oversee your wedding day. I hope your day will be as perfect as ours was thanks to Tara!
