### About this venue

Located in North Hollywood, CA, The Garland is a hotel and wedding venue. Unique event spaces, farm-fresh dining, and customized service await you and your guests at this landmark property. For several decades, this setting has hosted wedding festivities in style. In 1970, Hollywood legend and actress Beverly Garland, along with her husband Fillmore Crank, found this idyllic seven-acre property. Joining forces with Las Vegas hotel entrepreneur John Kell Houssels Jr., they planned an outstanding hotel for North Hollywood. Once the Beverly Garland hotel was completed, it served as a welcome retreat from the hustle and bustle of Los Angeles. The couple's son, James, was handed the property in 2000. Revamped as The Garland, this iconic property offers carefully landscaped outdoor parks, fresh decor, and new amenities along with the classic glamor. Beverly Park and its extension, Beverly Park West, provide excellent options for an outdoor ceremony and reception. An alternative outdoor setting is the Courtyard, with a delightful water fountain and several cabanas for al fresco cocktails. Indoors, the largest event space is the Garland Ballroom for up to 300 guests. El Camino is a more intimate area with a capacity of 100 guests. The Garland staff offers a range of packages to make your wedding planning more straightforward. Available options include in-house catering, bar services, event planning, and cleanup, along with the use of on-site accommodations, get-ready rooms, and WiFi. The culinary selections cover hors d'oeuvres, stations, buffets, plated meals, and more. Additionally, parking, valet service, and wheelchair access make these premises even more convenient.

We had spent all of summer unsuccessfully touring other wedding venues, and by the time we had toured 8 venues, we were left pretty disheartened. Every venue felt like we had to ta...

lk ourselves into why we would have our wedding there. Then, on a whim, my wife found The Garland, right under our noses in Studio City. From the minute we walked into The Garland lobby, we felt that this place was special. The 70s vibe of the decor, the kind front desk staff, and the visibly happy guests walking in and out immediately comforted us. Then, our lovely event sales representatives, Esmeralda at the time, greeted us and took us to The Beverly Park and The Beverly Park West to show us the spaces we were interested. The moment we walked into the Beverly Park is one neither of us will forget, because we knew right away that we were getting married there. The beautiful greenery and decor made it seem as though we entered a garden, and we couldn't have imagined a better place for us to say, "I do." During the sales process, The Garland was very understanding of both our cultures, Middle Eastern and Mexican, and was very accommodating with any traditions we needed to fulfill for ourselves and our families. They were also very transparent with the pricing and responsive with any of the million questions and "what if" scenarios we gave them. I can confidently say that every one of the promises they made us during this process was fulfilled throughout the planning and execution of the wedding itself. After we signed our contract, some time passed, and we were introduced to our new event representative, Britney, and the supervising event manager for The Garland, Vanessa. Throughout the planning process, Britney tended to our every whim--and let me tell you, we did not make it easy. We might have over a hundred separate email threads with different questions and particular requests that both Britney and The Garland as a whole had went above and beyond to accommodate. There was never a moment in the process where we nervous or anxious, because Britney always made us feel confident that she and The Garland had our backs and would do whatever was in their power to achieve our dreams. Then came the day of, and everything went...exactly as planned. It was perfect. Everything down to the smallest of details was perfect, and I think anyone can tell you how rare that is for any large event, let alone a wedding. The staff was incredibly attentive, and both Britney and The Garland made sure every detail of the event was set up exactly as our planner had conveyed per our wishes. Lastly, I want to share some feedback from the guests. Every guest loved the food and had only compliments about the amazing service, which is exactly what we had experienced from the moment we walked into the lobby the very first day. No one has been able to stop talking about how beautiful the space was and how beautiful the night panned out overall. The Garland has been an absolute dream to work with and has made our dream come true. You have no idea the bliss we feel that we were able to work with them to give our friends, families, and most of all, ourselves, a night we'll never forget. One thousand thank yous to Britney, the absolute best, and The Garland as a whole.

Every one of our guests fell in love with the location and loved the food which is one of the reasons we chose The Garland for this very special occasion. Our wedding party stayed at the hotel entire weekend and had the best time celebrating! The rooms at the hotel are all decorated beautifully with a cool mid century vibe we were looking for. Jasmine, the coordinator at the hotel, was a pleasure to work with during the stressful planning stages. She is highly professional and responsive and kept me updated throughout the entire process.

h our coordinators to help make our event unforgettable. When we decided to check out the Garland for our wedding we had no idea they had such a beautiful space. We had the reception and cocktail hour in Beverly Park West, which is a hidden spot with trees, twinkle lights, a fountain and a fire pit. Everyone from LA who attended commented that they had no idea that this gorgeous space was here and neither did we. We had the reception in the main ballroom and it was equally as beautiful. The room is simple but classy with modern gold lighting fixtures and neutral colors that allow you to make the space your own. We also had access to the outside patio adjacent to the ballroom where we were able to stage our photobooth, guestbook and seating chart. And there are couches and heaters on that patio in case a guest wants to relax away from the festivities. The food and drinks at cocktail hour and the sit-down dinner were wonderful. Many people commented that it was some of the best wedding food they’ve ever had. One thing that we also loved was that the cake comes with the venue - we were able to taste the cake at The Garland and that made it stress free. Not to mention it was delicious and beautiful. The hotel itself is also a great place for out of town guests. We had about 60 out of town guests and most of them stayed at the hotel and people loved it. The Garland is a hidden gem in North Hollywood and Jasmine and the rest of the staff will help you throw your dream wedding.

I was married at The Garland just over a week ago and the entire experience was a dream come true. We booked the Beverly Park, a magical outdoor oasis, for our cocktail party, cer...

emony and reception for 200. They have permanent stings of lights and lush gardens and it all made for an enchanted event. With the 10pm sound curfew outside, we also rented their Beverly Garland (movie) theater from 8pm - midnight. We planned special programming for our guests and arranged for post-wedding snacks in the theater for anyone who wanted to hang out longer. Everything about this property made for a unique and memorable event. The catering events manager - Jasmine Townsend was beyond a dream to work with. She made us feel like our wedding was their only event/priority. Shockingly wonderful attention and service. The food and drink were all fabulous. Even our wedding cake was included in the package and it was divine. We had a sizable room block, that sold out, plus other friends staying at the property. People are still commenting how much they loved everything about the wedding and the hotel and the kind service from everyone. I learned so much over the many months of planning the wedding. One tip - at first, I thought we didn't need a dance floor brought in for the reception. Then closer to the wedding, I realized it was going to look like we were dancing in a parking lot without one. Jasmine recommended Trejio dance floors, who gave us a great quote and we booked a glossy white floor. It was stunning and worth every penny! I'm so glad the Garland will be a special place in our life moving forward and we'll probably come back for our anniversary every year. I'm so grateful for everything they did for us and with us!

We found the Beverly Park venue at The Garland and were absolutely mesmerized. It was the perfect outdoor spot and it did not feel like you were in a big city at all. The sound of ...

the fountain in the center and the beautiful tree canopies made you think you were in a private garden far in the countryside. Our wedding was absolutely perfect. We had two days' worth of events - one Indian wedding and one traditional American/Western wedding at the same venue space. The staff (Tanya and her team) were incredibly communicative and supportive. They helped us figure out how to make the best decisions for our guests and accommodated special diets with ease. We will never forget our wedding weekend and we're so lucky we got to have it here. Thank you so much to the whole team!

We couldn’t be happier that we had our wedding at The Garland! From our first meeting, they impressed us with great customer service, making sure we knew they were here to make our...

wedding day vision come to life. Our original coordinator left partway through the year, but Lindsey jumped in with professionalism and enthusiasm. Especially in the week leading up to the wedding, she was on top of every last detail and communicating with us constantly. Thanks to her, we went into the day confident that everything would go smoothly, so we were relaxed and just enjoyed the wedding! One of our main draws was the catering connected to The Front Yard. The food was excellent—we received so many compliments from our guests, especially about the short rib that melts in your mouth. The staff made sure we were fed during the cocktail hour and reception, and we’re glad we got to enjoy the delicious food! Tony, the catering captain, was fantastic and there for whatever we needed. The cake was included in the package (we highly recommend Delicious Bakery!). The garden is a surprisingly hidden gem behind the hotel. It’s impossible to tell that you’re close to the highway. With trees and greenery surrounding us, the backdrop of our ceremony was beautiful. We had our cocktail hour in the back of the garden, which made for an easy transition. The ballroom for our reception turned out gorgeous, especially with the flowers and uplights we added. Overall, The Garland just made it all easy. Having an all-inclusive venue handle catering, linens, tables, ceremony space, cake, etc. simplified everything. We were so impressed with how flexible and accommodating they were. They were happy to make any customizations to their wedding packages to create the right fit for our wedding and budget. It was an incredible experience, and The Garland helped make our wedding day perfect!

Christopher, our wedding coordinator, kept in touch with us through the entire process, answering all of our questions, and accommodating all of our wishes, and he was also such a pleasure to work with. He even had a framed photo from the ceremony, strawberries and champagne waiting in our room when we returned after the reception. The service was phenomenal - we never had to ask for a thing throughout the entire night - and the food was awesome! We had so many guests tell us it was one of the most beautiful weddings they'd been to and it was largely because of the Garland and Christopher. My husband and I couldn't be happier with how perfectly everything turned out. It really was a magical day!

Based on the property as a venue for ceremony, cocktail hour, and reception, I would give The Garland five stars. It's breathtaking and we got many compliments from our guests abou...

t the property. I would book The Garland again in an instant, however I would be cautious about the service (which is why I'm giving three stars). When we originally booked The Garland, our point of contact was Jessica. We LOVED her from the minute we met her. She was always willing to go above and beyond for us, and we felt so safe with our wedding in her hands. Her role was technically that of a Sales/Catering Manager, but her demeanor had us under the impression that she was more of a wedding coordinator at The Garland. And in the end, that caused a lot of trouble for us. About three months before the wedding, we got a call from Jessica that she would be leaving her job at The Garland. We were really disappointed to be losing her, but even more so because she informed us of this ONE DAY before her last day of work. She connected us with Kayli, who would be taking over for her. To say that Kayli didn't live up to Jessica's standards would be an understatement. We had difficultly communicating with her about our needs and she would go weeks without responding to my emails, whereas Jessica would respond the same day. And then one week before our wedding day, I received a call from Kayli that she was quitting her job at The Garland too. ONE WEEK before the wedding. I was extremely panicked, but Kayli could not be less bothered by this. Christopher, the Event Manager at The Garland, took over for us. He was very responsive to my emails voicing my concerns, however he was NOT responsive to my husband and I asking how The Garland would compensate us for all of the stress they put us through. We were told that situations like this happen all the time and there's nothing they can do. We were incredibly unhappy and had it not been a week before the wedding, we would have reconsidered having our wedding at The Garland. When it came to the day of the wedding, Christopher was there, however he was not "present." Nor was he proactive; we always had to seek him out if we needed something, but he was never able to anticipate any issues. All of our vendors had trouble trying to find out where to go and what to do once they got to The Garland. And our DJ informed us that Christopher was not great at communicating with anyone. Both our florist and our photographer needed to get to our room at a certain time before the ceremony, and they were not allowed into the building. This caused us to run into unnecessary problems. One of my biggest issues is that at the reception, my husband and I looked over to see our vendors sitting the floor. No table was provided for them to sit at while they were eating their vendor meals. I could not have felt more shame or embarrassment in that moment. I do appreciate that the staff was able to resolve the situation when we mentioned it, however it never should have happened in the first place. We were also disappointed with the food and how long dinner service took. The food did not taste nearly as good as it did at the tasting and there were too many lulls during dinner. Many of our guests looked bored waiting for their meals to arrive. Overall, I would recommend The Garland based on the venue. However, I suggest hiring your own wedding planner to ensure that things run smoothly. And be prepared for last minute problems.

Response from The Garland on 11/24/2017

Hi Ciara, We hope you had a lovely Thanksgiving. It was such an honor to share in your ...

special day at The Garland. We’re happy you have some beautiful memories, but am sorry to hear of the frustrations you experienced. We have discussed these items as a team to ensure we continue to improve for future weddings and events. The week of your wedding, I did email your vendors a property map highlighting the area used for your wedding, setup access, and also shared with them your timeline for the wedding. Your florist had asked about delivering to your suite and was informed we cannot give out guest room numbers or provide access to the guest room buildings due to security for other guests, and was told she would need to contact you to have someone come and grant access to your suite. Regarding vendor meals, we do arrange for a designated area to serve vendors meals – either the Green Room or the Cabanas, both outside of the Ballroom. Your vendors would’ve been notified and escorted to this area once we served their meals, but a table was requested to be set inside the ballroom, so we served them there. I am sorry you felt I wasn’t present enough. Myself and our banquet team was onsite and available the entire day for anything anyone needed and recall only one instance where Mike’s mom had asked to get some of the items I was holding for the welcome table. She later shared compliments on how accommodating everyone had been. However, I take your feedback to heart and will work to improve this for future events. You and Mike had expressed frustrations regarding the change in event managers at The Garland and asked that your guest parking be offered complimentary, to which Kayli and I presented to the team on your behalf. We were happy to gain approval to further discount your parking to $8, which you accepted. Additionally, we were able to provide you with a complimentary upgrade to your suite the night prior to your wedding to ease the day-of prep. We strive to ensure that each and every event held at The Garland is nothing less than extraordinary, and again apologize that this was not your experience. Thank you again for hosting your wedding with us and for sharing your feedback. Please let me know how I may be of further assistance. Kindly, Christopher Preston The Garland Hotel

I'm writing two reviews for the Garland because I just can't say enough how amazing it was having our wedding there. They gave us a suite for the wedding. It has two rooms with 3...

beds. It was VERY spacious with an awesome bed and great amenities. The pool is really relaxing (even though we didn't use it) and the food at the restaurant was GREAT!! The staff is amazingly friendly and Really nice. The only con I can say is you have to pay for parking.

modeled & looked amazing. Its has this old hollywood atmosphere which I loved! I couldn't pass up on this place b/c the name (too superficial) plus very good pricing. We paid under $18K for 200 people incld. alcohol & had the venue unil 1am!!! Tony V. was amazing b/c he was able to deal with me (crazy bride). closer to the wedding date i called him so much, but he never seemed annoyed - where anyone else would be. He was so great. There was a slight problem with our hotel room & he went above & beyond to make sure that it got resolved & I was happy. The cocktail hour was in the outside patio which was beautiful! the food was sooo good! And the service was great! I had a lot of left over cake & they stored if for me until I checked out the next day. Great location!!!
