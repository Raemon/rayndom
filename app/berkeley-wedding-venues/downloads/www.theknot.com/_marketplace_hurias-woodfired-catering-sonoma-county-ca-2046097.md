Chef Mohaimen and his team were able to feed 120 of our guests in a timely manner. I would strongly recommend catering with Hurias for your wedding or big event.

imen, they were organized, responsive and kind! They provided us with all the information we needed to prepare for our event as well as clear, transparent pricing. They worked with our venue to ensure setup was all taken care of by the time we arrived for the event, so we didn't have to think about any of that while we were traveling to the venue. On the day, Chef Mohaimen had pizzas going for the entire duration of the party, so the slices were always hot out of the oven, and absolutely delicious. We were so excited to work with them as we were currently living in New York and loved their Brooklyn to North Bay story, and they live up to both NY and CA pizza expectations! Everyone raved about all 3 pizzas and had a hard time picking a favorite. The whole event went so well, and part of that is absolutely due to the warmth, joy & amazing work of the Huria's team. Thank you so much!!

as a great experience, but here are my highlights: \- Super responsive communication \- "Plug & Play" catering, a reliable and self contained service. \- Flexible to my unique-ish situation \- Excellent food. \- Hyper personable. I mentioned liking lamb in passing, and weeks later they communicated when they were adjusting their menu to include it. If you're on the fence about them, go grab a pizza during one of their pop ups. We did, and we still do. The best!

Adriana and Chef Mohaimen at Huria’s are an absolute dream to work with—I truly can’t recommend them highly enough. The food was not only delicious and deeply comforting (like a ta...

ste of home), but also presented with a level of care and beauty that far exceeds typical buffet-style service. Their attention to detail was impeccable, and every element felt intentional and elevated. The pizza was genuinely some of the best I’ve ever had—and serving it hot and fresh in 60-degree foggy weather? That speaks volumes about their skill, timing, and seamless execution. It’s clear they run a well-oiled machine that ensures guests are well-fed without ever feeling like they’re waiting. Beyond the food, Adriana and Chef Mohaimen were among the kindest, warmest people I’ve had the pleasure of working with. Their genuine hospitality and passion for what they do shone through in every interaction—and the guests noticed, too. They went above and beyond to make the couple feel special, including a stunning heart-shaped pizza adorned with flowers that matched the wedding aesthetic. I’ve been craving their food every night since and will absolutely continue recommending Huria’s to anyone in search of an incredible caterer. They’re truly something special.

They worked with our budget, offered options for dietary restrictions, and brought warmth and kindness to our wedding- not to mention some of the best pizza we have ever had - and that was across our guests (who a chunk of them were from NY).

ly answered my many, many questions. She helped us arrive at a fabulous menu for both nights and made great suggestions along the way. Chef Mohaimen was also so lovely and wonderful both nights. He arrived well in advance and had plenty of time to set up. They do an excellent job making the catering station - complete with sparkly lights and flowers! We had pizzas the first night which were all outstanding, paired with a simple but delicious arugula salad, and the warm spiced olives. Do yourself a favor, get the olives, and thank me later. We cleaned out a ...very...large bowl of olives. The second night we chose from the tapas and large plates, which also were amazing. The crab toast is divine! Again, Mohaimen brought the energy and did such a great job plating the food, keeping it fresh, and feeding our hungry guests. Our guests spoke endlessly about the food both nights, and adored Mohaimen as well. We are so happy we chose Huria's and absolutely would do it all over again.

It was so much food that Huria’s even packed up the leftover pizzas for us to enjoy later, which was so kind! Our guests were very impressed by how fresh, flavorful, and beautiful everything was. It’s evident that Adriana and Chef Mohaimen put so much thought and care into what they do; they worked with us closely to make sure everything went perfectly. They have honed their craft and don’t deviate from their curated dishes, but that’s what we were looking for—experts who we could rely on to create a memorable (and delicious) experience. That’s exactly what the Huria’s delivered. It was the best night ever! Thank you Adriana and Chef Mohaimen!

Hurias's also took the time to come out for a site visit to help choose the best spot for their mobile set up a month before our wedding. On the wedding day everything ran so smoothly and even exceeded our expectations. Their set up also looked lovely and went well with our wedding aesthetic. Mohamein is an amazing chef and we LOVED our pizzas, beets, hummus and flatbread. The food was so delicious, fresh and flavorful!! The pizzas came out quickly and our guests were all fed in great timing. Honestly everything was amazing.. Thank you Huria’s for providing incredible food and such warmth!!

Huria's catered our June 2022 wedding in Mendocino, California and working with them was a highlight of our wedding! The food was amazing. We had a charcuterie table, three pizza...

s, and the chicken shawarma and everything was outstanding. So many of guests also told us that their favorite part of our wedding was the food. Working with Adriana and Mohaimen was also unbelievably easy. They are so responsive by email and are just the kindest people to work with. We feel so lucky to have had them be a part of our wedding. I cannot recommend Huria's enough for a delicious and memorable wedding meal :)

Huria's catered my December 2019 wedding in Santa Rosa and they were fabulous! Adriana & Chef Huria were the perfect fit for the vibe we were setting. The pizza is beyond delicious...

and we received so many notes from our guests about how much they enjoyed the food! Best of all, we had dairy-free and vegan folks in attendance and they were able to accommodate these diet restrictions with zero issues. Adriana was such a pro and was easy to coordinate with which I appreciated because I was not only the bride but also the coordinator of the whole event. I can't say enough good things. Booking Huria's for my wedding was the best decision ever!
