I loved the idea of working with an all-woman DJ team for my wedding, and Heart of Gold was great. Jessika was so respectful of exactly what we wanted for our music. We have her a ...

lot of freedom when it came to the music for cocktail hour and dinner, and I loved her selections. When it came to dancing, I had a highly curated playlist that I wanted her to stick to. Not only did Jessika play all the songs on my playlist, but she didn’t mind me checking in several times throughout the evening to make sure we were on track. She dealt with my controlling ways very well! We got lots of comments from guests that we loved her positive attitude and how much fun she was having behind the DJ booth! She also sent me a playlist after the wedding, so we can relive the dance floor any time we’d like!

ds. Together, we created playlists for our pre-ceremony, ceremony, cocktail hour, dinner, and reception. Ray took our style of music and expanded on it with great suggestions and flow. During the reception, Ray expertly read the room and even though we had a smaller wedding, there was never a lull in the event. Our friend sang our processional and first dance song and Ray worked one-on-one with her so that the levels were perfect. Also, our wedding took place in a remote, outdoor area of Big Sur where the venue had multiple levels for each part of the event. Ray expertly set up speakers and controllers for each level so that the music was seamless throughout the night. All of our guest commented on how great the music was and how Ray kept the energy up late into the night. Ray helped make our wedding unforgettable and we couldn’t have asked for a better DJ.

DJ Ray was not only accommodating of all of this, but so excited to work with us and incorporate all of the different musical vibes. And the party was amazing. The dance floor was never empty and only got more and more energetic as the night went on. We had a great time working with them and highly recommend!

She seamlessly blended an indie-focused cocktail hour and dinner into a fantastic pop-focused dance party that kept our guests dancing the whole time. Book with DJ Jordan--she is the best!!!

the start: we mentioned we love star wars and they were 100% on board, encouraging us to bring lightsabers and even had a mix of the cantina music ready to play. They rolled with our long and eclectic playlist requests, and got excited to hit all of our regional subgenres (hyphy to New Orleans bounce), knowing just what would get the dance floor going! We can’t recommend Ray enough, they made all of our dance floor dreams come to life and were so wonderful and fun to work with. If you want an epic wedding DJ who will make you feel so seen on your big night – hire Ray. We can’t imagine our celebration without them <3

Omg - We. LOVE. Heart of Gold! Specifically, DJ Sami Fink. We can NOT say enough amazing words about them. We booked them for our Santa Cruz wedding last November. From our first ...

meeting, Sami felt like someone we had been friends with forever, and all three of us had similar musical upbringings and histories. Their knowledge of all genres of music, and overall enthusiasm for blending different styles was so appreciated by my wife and I. We also really valued the time Sami took getting to know us as people and a couple; and enjoyed getting to know them and their background as well. It made the wedding day feel so familiar and at ease, which was important to us since we were having an intimate, 50-person destination wedding with just family and close friends. On our wedding day itself, Sami KILLED IT. We have been talking about the flawless job they did for months. now! They took all of the conversations we had during planning about likes/dislikes, our must play list, and combined that with their own knowledge and DJ style to make it the perfect night. Sami also made sure to check in with us throughout the night to make sure we were happy with everything, and tailored the song choices to the energy of the dance floor effortlessly. My wife and I were also looking for someone that didn't have too "over the top" of an MC style, and Sami also rode that line perfectly. They were so natural when speaking to the crowd - matching the vibe of us and our guests seamlessly. Some of the musical moments of the night are still being talked about by us and our guests. There couldn't have been a better fit for our wedding day than Dj Sami. Additionally, my wife's best man performed a song at the reception - Sami was quick to offer their help when we let them know during the planning process that this was happening, and made sure the audio ran perfectly for that on the day as well! Speaking on Heart of Gold as a company, working with Allison to find and book the best DJ for our wedding was such an easy breezy overall experience. Never felt pushed to make a decision that didn't fit us, and was genuinely kind, efficient and communicative the whole time. We knew we would be in great hands from the very beginning, and would book with them over and over again. Don't even hesitate, there's no one better!!! Thank you Heart of Gold & DJ Sami! :)

nd professional and she helped us find the right DJ for our event. We worked with DJ Ray for our wedding this past November and Ray was INCREDIBLE. They put together the perfect playlists for our mingle, the dinner, and the party. And WOW our guests didn't stop dancing the ENTIRE night! I am bias (since it was my wedding) BUT many of our guests say that they haven't ever had as much fun and that is because Ray had a great base playlist but adapted to the vibes and read the room to put the right songs on to keep the party going. I would recommend Heart of Gold and DJ Ray any time! 10/10!

There were zero technical issues day of and so many of our guests of all ages complimented the music. Every song Jordan played in addition to our must play list perfectly fit us and the vibe of the wedding. I wish I had a reason to have Jordan play personal dance parties for me all the time because it was just that good! She also did a fabulous job as MC and keeping things on schedule. And last but not least she helped one of my biggest wedding dreams come true! I wanted a packed dance floor filled with all of my guests doing Chappel Roan’s HOTTOGO and she delivered! She taught all my guests the dance and got the most guests on the dance floor we had all night for the song! Jordan and Heart of Gold were excellent to work with and we’d recommend them to anyone in a heartbeat!

We didn't really have many thoughts for our wedding reception beyond throw a big party, but we knew the DJ and the music would be essential. We wouldn't be able to do this without ...

Eun Neam (DJ Neamatode, and I love the name) who was super chill and accessible when we talked about our vision, and asked us questions to help verbalize what we wanted. I didn't even know cake cutting songs existed as a concept (songs to cut the cake to) but now I can't think of that moment without hearing our ridiculous song choice in the background. I'm still waiting on the professional photos to be released, but rest assured there's a lot of photos and videos from my friends of them screaming along with our music on the dancefloor. We truly had such a good time.

We told them that our group was not big on dancing, but you’d never know because the dance floor was packed the entire night. Sami is exactly who you’d want around the day of your wedding — kind, relaxed, professional, but knows how to get a party started and keep it going. If you want to have the time of your life, we very highly recommend booking DJ Sami for your event!

DJ Pauline and Heart of Gold made our wedding, for lack of a better word, EPIC. Through the planning process they were communicative and generous with their time. Good music was a ...

huge priority to us, and as our wedding was Studio 54 themed, we wanted to strike the tricky balance of on theme, but not too on theme. Pauline just GOT it, from the first meeting together we knew it was the perfect choice. The dance floor was packed from start to finish, and it felt like she was reading our minds for what we wanted to hear next. She wasn't afraid to stray away from basic, and catered (after about an hour of more family friendly tunes) mostly to us, which was perfect!! Can't recommend this company enough, especially DJ Pauline!!

w an amazing dance party but for someone with run of show experience and Allison, our DJ and founder of HOG ensured the seamless operation of all the sound-related elements throughout our entire wedding. We heard compliments of our DJs professionalism and song selection from a number of attendees. Allison’s communication, coordination, and planning efforts were key in reducing the stress and effort of the overall wedding planning process. We did not have to worry about any potential sound-related issues during the ceremony, speeches, or dancing portion of the evening. Additionally, my husband is a DJ himself so he has a high standard for the expertise of his fellow DJs and he wanted to play his own short set during our dance party. Allison was gracious enough to collaborate with him in order to make that happen. She is upbeat, easy going, and her experience and confidence at our specific venue was helpful. We highly recommend Heart of Gold for any special events you throw!

We hired Sami Fink for our wedding this weekend and they were absolutely amazing. Definitely one of our favorite vendors we hired for the day. They were so sweet, helpful, and know...

ledgeable. They helped with transitions and killed it on the dance floor. All of our guests were raving about how fun the party was and how seamless the day went. Sami just knew what to do and didn't have to ask any questions! 100% would hire Sami again, what a fun special day! You cannot go wrong with Sami and heart of gold! So glad we found them. Everything was so smooth because of Sami and I will be forever grateful!

If you're looking for a DJ who knows their music, from punk to funk and everything in between, look no further. DJ Sami Fink curated the perfect music for our wedding day that seam...

lessly blended both of our music interests. We had two phone meetings leading up to the wedding to discuss expectations, goals, and timeline. We were asked to create a few sample playlists to give them a better idea of our musical tastes, including a list of 15 Must Play songs (very helpful!). Sami was open-minded, listened to our wants and needs, and offered expert advice. On the big day, we finally met and were so impressed with Sami throughout the day. They were punctual, professional, FUN, and easy to work with. We had some delays, and Sami kept us on track to optimize our dancing time, which was very important to us. Sami also communicated well with our other vendors and event coordinator. 10/10 would highly recommend DJ Sami for any event needing a spectacular musical backdrop. Over and over again, we'd choose Sami and cannot thank them enough for making our day pure magic!!! Photo credit: Photo + Beauty + Photobooth LOVE + WOLVES CO (www.loveandwolves.co)

Can I give DJ Christie 100 stars?! She was hands down the best DJ I've ever seen, and my wife and I are SO glad she was able to DJ our wedding. The number 1 thing we've been hearin...

g from all of our guests was that it was the best music/DJ set they've ever seen at a wedding before, which was so important to us when we were choosing a DJ for our wedding. From the very first conversation we had with her, we instantly loved her vibe. She made sure to reiterate several times to us "it's YOUR wedding day, don't do anything you don't want to do." She made sure to remind us that we don't need to do anything just because it's "typical" for weddings, which helped us think outside the box a bit more and be a bit more creative. She also let us be as hands on with the music selection as we wanted. Throughout our conversations, she listened to what we wanted and what was important to us, provided inputs and suggestions, but never pressured us into anything. We even had some particular requests when it came to song choices and where we wanted to cut certain parts of the song, where we wanted to loop a song, and she handled all of that so seamlessly. To anyone getting married or considering Christie for your event, please do yourself a favor and book her - you won't regret it! She'll make sure your guests are out on the dance floor the whole night - tailoring the music as she goes to fit the mood and keep people having a good time. Plus, she's so kind and lovely to work with! Thank you, thank you, Christie!! You're the best!

eamless. As we worked with her during planning, Allison embodied a great mix of sharing her expertise and listening to figure out exactly how to bring our dance floor dreams to life. On the night of the wedding itself, we couldn’t have been happier. She played a perfect progression of songs that always fit the mood as the night went on. Anytime we stepped away for even a second, the next song would come on and we would have to come running back. Our friends and family both raved about how much fun they had; we felt like every song was our favorite song ever. Hire Allison and Heart of Gold for your wedding, you won’t regret it!

Jessika was our DJ for our March 2024 wedding in Oakland. Heart of Gold was a pleasure to work with from the start. We came across them on a recommended vendor list from our venue....

Allison was immediately responsive and asked us what we were looking for in a DJ before connecting us with DJ Jessika for an initial call. We felt comfortable with Jessika right away and she understood our vibe. As we talked to Jessika we learned that she is involved in music in many ways and is clearly passionate about what she does. She had us fill out a questionnaire with a detailed timeline so she was well prepared on the day of the wedding. We told her it was especially important to us that our friends and family of all ages enjoyed dancing at our wedding, and I think she nailed the assignment! Thank you, DJ Jessika!

We hired Eun Neam at Heart of Gold DJs for our winter wedding and we cannot recommend them highly enough!! We had many different genres that we wanted featured during the parts of ...

our day (pre-ceremony, cocktail hour, dinner, and reception) and Eun Neam helped curate the perfect song lists for each. Eun Neam was flexible (especially with my long do-not-play list), super fun to work with, and very professional. Eun Neam was particularly great at reading the room and adjusting to the vibe. We got tons of compliments from our guests - everyone could see that they are passionate about doing this and incredibly skilled. During the reception, Eun Neam's moves behind the DJ table helped keep our dance floor popping the whole night, and their song discretion was absolutely on point. It was banger after banger, and you could not have peeled me away from that dance floor!! After the wedding, Eun Neam sent us the playlists on Spotify so that my spouse and I can keep listening to them, which was really above and beyond. Thank you for making our special day absolutely unforgettable!!

In planning our wedding we really wanted to create the unique and immersive feel of an intimate dinner party on a wedding sized scale, and DJ Jordan and the team at Heart of Gold absolutely made it a reality!

The big day was better than we could have ever hoped, as the music evolved carrying everyone through a beautiful, emotional, and exciting evening.
