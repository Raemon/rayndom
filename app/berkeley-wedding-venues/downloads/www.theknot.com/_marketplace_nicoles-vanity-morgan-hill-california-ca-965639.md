She’s so professional, kind, punctual and communicative. I knew I could trust her leading up to the wedding and of course, on the wedding day. You truly don’t need to look further- SHE IS YOUR GIRL!!!

Trial * Make Up Trial: I was looking for a makeup artist who does a light, natural look since I don’t normally wear a lot of makeup on a day to day basis. Nicole did exactly that! ...

* Hair Trial: I wanted a half up, half down, with very curly hair since my curls tend to fall out at the end of the night. The hair clips that I bought wasn’t what I had envisioned so Nicole suggested fresh baby breath instead which was the perfect small touch I was looking for. Day Of * Nicole, Danielle, and Silvia arrived at the venue on time. They each had their own hair/make up station. Even though we had 22 services, they stayed on schedule and it never felt rushed, always at ease. Everyone looked gorgeous and loved how their hair and makeup turned out! Overall * Nicole is so sweet, kind, and personable. She made me feel so calm and comfortable at both the trial and the day of. I would 1000% highly recommend her for both your wedding day hair and make up as she did a fabulous job! Thank you so much, Nicole!

d makeup for my engagement photos as well as my wedding day. She is so sweet and has the best personality! She makes you feel beautiful even when you haven’t been feeling your best. I booked Nicole for my engagement shoot photos last year and she did a FABULOUS job where the makeup stayed even through a light rain! So I knew she was the one I wanted to make me feel my best on one of the most important day of my life! I signed up for the Bridal Bootcamp facials and they made ALL the difference for the big day! The makeup went on like butter and my skin was glowing the whole night! Nicole and Sylvia took care of my family the morning of my wedding, and their awesome personalities made everyone feel relaxed and excited for the day! Everyone’s hair and makeup looked AMAZING and everyone felt confident all night long! For me, I felt the most beautiful I have ever felt and you can tell in the photos because I just couldn’t stop smiling. If you want to feel and look your best, for your wedding, or any event, choose Nicole! Not only does she slay the beauty game, but her demeanor will out you at ease and she’ll hype you up! And I still plan to keep coming back to her for facials because she’s the best. Love you Nicole!!

cause I’ve always felt so self conscious of my skin. I was SO nervous for our first visit getting the hydrofacial and I walked out feeling so confident. She made me feel so good about myself while being so educated and thoughtful about my skin. Her personality is so calming and easy to connect with which made me feel so comfortable during each session. She let me open up about my skin journey and concerns in the most mindful way and helped me come up with ways I would feel comfortable changing my skincare routine to help my concerns. I was so excited that I chose her for makeup and hair for my wedding day. I had her over at my house with my bridesmaids and mom and she fit RIGHT in. My bridesmaids to this day tell me how amazing she was and I totally agree. She clicked with each girl, did natural glam makeup on them and they all felt so confident and comfortable that day in their makeup. One of my bridesmaids actually clicked so well with her that she’s using her makeup suggestionsand skin care products now just like me! My mom, sister and I never get our makeup done so this was new to us and every single thing she did during the process made us feel and look our best and was so natural and glowy. She truly was such a special part of my wedding day and experience. I could go on and on about how wonderful Nicole is and the work that she does! She puts thought and love into each skin or makeup/hair session and goes above and beyond.

Nicole is an absolute GEM!! Working with her leading up to my wedding and on my wedding day was such a pleasure. Nicole is not only incredibly talented, but she has the heart of a...

teacher. She taught me SO MUCH throughout my bridal bootcamp, from what types of facials would be the most beneficial to achieve my wedding day goals, to the types of skin care products that would work best for my skin long after the wedding was over. I started my skincare journey with her towards the end of 2022, and am still a loyal client over a year later! As for my wedding day look, we did a hair and makeup trial beforehand, and Nicole was super receptive to feedback and made all the changes I requested to make sure I felt my most beautiful self on the big day. Everyone in my bridal party who had their hair and makeup done by Nicole could not speak more highly of her as well. Nicole is authentic, kind hearted, hard working, professional, and truly cares about her clients. I could not recommend her more!

If there is one thing to take away from reading this long review I am about to write, let me just say BOOK NICOLE FOR YOUR WEDDING ASAP! First, she is the most genuine, sweetest pe...

rson you will meet and want by your side for your wedding day. Secondly, a make-up artist and esthetician all in one? What more can you ask for? When I found Nicole’s business and past reviews from others, I knew I wanted her for my wedding day! I have always been insecure about my skin and wanted to feel my very best on my wedding day, which is exactly how I felt thanks to her! I did her Bridal Boot Camp package (do it you won’t regret it) and my skin was the best it ever looked and felt leading up to my wedding day. Not only did I love my make-up and look for my wedding day, but my 7 bridesmaids and my mother (yes she did all 9 of us by herself cause she is a rockstar) all loved their looks as well and could not say enough about Nicole as a make-up artist and person overall. We had the best time hanging out with her in our getting-ready suite and she made each of us feel the most beautiful without overdoing it and not looking like ourselves. She can go as natural or glammed up as you request. Having my skin and make up look perfect was a top priority for my wedding and Nicole went above and beyond at every facial appointment and the week leading up to my wedding day to make sure we accomplished just that. BONUS**** She also does airbrush tanning and I last minute decided I wanted a little something extra to boost my overall look and we got my airbrush done with a trial before and the actual one two days before my wedding and I was so happy with that service as well! Nicole made me feel like the most beautiful bride and it really came across well because so many guests told me how beautiful I looked. Lastly, after my make up trial I decided to sleep in my make up (I know should never do this and I usually do not) but I wanted to see if it would stay all night long and let me tell ya, I woke up and my make up looked the same as when we applied it. On my actual wedding I did not have to touch up or check my make up at all, just reapplied some lipstick as my night went on feeling flawless thanks to her. She is a make-up magician and I love her! We keep regular facial appointments now. Book her!

Nicole was such a pleasure to work with for my wedding in Monterey. Even with the long trek from SF to Morgan Hill for my trial, it was so worth it! I was able to show her photos f...

or my hair and make up. She was so knowledgeable about the reality of make up in a photo vs how it actually presents on your face. Who knew that Sofia Richie’s natural wedding look was more than meets the eye and required a make up artist to follow her around?? Nicole did! She also used make up suited for my dry skin (can’t say the same for my engagement picture MUA) and made sure to take notes for the day of. The make up never felt caked on and although I don’t wear much make up on a day to day basis, I loved it and did not feel overdone!! She is so easy to talk to and helped make my wedding morning feel more calm. She never seemed rushed or behind schedule (methodical schedule was all made ahead of time). She brought a second MUA (Silvia - who was also so sweet) with her and they worked well together (even though they have their own separate businesses). Everyone in my wedding party chose their desired hair and make up and they all looked beautiful (bridesmaids, MOB, and MOG)! My make up and hair looked great all day and she gave me tips for keeping everything looking amazing. She worked well with our wedding planner and other vendors and I was so glad to have found her (I think finding a good MUA was most stressful since everyone will see it)!! I really felt like a princess. Definitely recommend!!

ing day. It was also fun getting to know her sweet personality and bonding over our fur babies in the months leading up to the wedding so that by the day of, it felt like I had another friend that was getting ready with me. She was flexible on timing, had my bridal party ready early, and was a fun addition to the big day. My whole bridal party loved their hair and makeup. I had recently had surgery leaving a scar on my neck. Nicole covered my scar with makeup to level that I felt comfortable. Huge thanks to Nicole, I felt the most beautiful I’d ever felt on my wedding day. Nicole was the best! I’ve already got her booked for my maternity photos as well. Thank you Nicole!!

Nicole is amazing! I I was able to do Nicole’s facial bridal bootcamp so I got to know Nicole leading up to my big day with monthly facials and she made the experience so much fun....

She was always super sweet and helped prep my skin for my September wedding. She helped exceed all my expectations for my hair and makeup and I felt so beautiful. Both my hair and makeup lasted ALL DAY and I even slept with my up-do because I didn’t want to undo all it’s glory!And it my bridal hair still looked good for the next morning. ;)

ust cannot thank her enough. I was never a makeup person, but she somehow just knew exactly what I wanted the day of the trial and made sure I was still just as show-stopping as ever on my wedding day!! And my hair... *chef's kiss* lol. Also, Nicole is just a fantastic person to work with--she communicates well, she's punctual, skillful, super fun and friendly, and she made me feel uber glowed up on my wedding day (my skin was FAH-LAWLESS thanks to her kind advice months before the wedding). All in all, I had a blast working with her and her amazing assistant and I'll continue to recommend her to anyone forever! Thanks Nicole!

Nicole did my hair and makeup on my wedding day last September and she was such a delight to work with! We scheduled a trial a few months before my wedding and she really helped me...

figure out my makeup look and options for my hair (all I knew is that I wanted a curly updo, defined eyes, and burgundy lip). The trial really helped me feel more confident for how it would turn out on my wedding day and sure enough, she did not disappoint! I absolutely loved how everything turned out! Her pricing is extremely reasonable too especially for the bay area. I also knew I wanted a secondary stylist to help with the group size I had (we had 7 people including myself who got both hair and makeup done) and the lady she brought in did a great job also. They both arrived on time the morning of and were very efficient to get everyone finished on time. Overall, Nicole is the best. I would 100% use her services again!

Nicole did an AMAZING job on my hair and makeup (and the makeup of a couple of my bridesmaids) for my wedding. I rarely wear makeup or get my hair professionally done, so I wanted ...

to look polished but natural. She perfectly captured what I was hoping for and made me feel so confident and beautiful. On her website, she also has pictures of very glam wedding looks that she’s done, so she is great at listening to your vision/looking at examples of what you’re going for and recreating your dream look. My wedding day went by so fast, but I’ll always have the pictures to put in an album and on my walls, so it was really important to me to have hair and makeup that I was happy with and would forever be captured in those photos. Along with being great at what she does, Nicole was such a fun, friendly person to start the day off with me and my bridesmaids, which was also important to me to start the day off with good vibes. Highly recommend Nicole!
