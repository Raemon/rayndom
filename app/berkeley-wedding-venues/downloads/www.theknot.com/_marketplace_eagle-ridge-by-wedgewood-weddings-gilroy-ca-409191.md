e beautiful on our wedding day. The entire team was incredibly kind, attentive, and genuinely excited for us, but Kelly deserves a special shoutout. We absolutely loved her. She went above and beyond in every possible way—most memorably by framing one of our wedding photos and sending it home with us. That alone shows how much she truly cares. The food was incredible, and our guests are still talking about it. We were having so much fun dancing that we didn’t even finish our cake, and the team thoughtfully saved it for us, which meant so much at the end of the night. The pricing was also very budget friendly, and they truly work with you to make your vision happen within what you can afford, which made the planning process so much less stressful. Everyone is still telling us how beautiful and fun our wedding was, and it honestly means the world to us. Knowing that our guests felt the love, joy, and magic of the day makes our hearts so full. None of it would have been possible without this incredible team and Kelly, who put so much care into every detail. We will always be grateful for everything they did to make our wedding day unforgettable, and we cannot recommend this venue enough 🤍

We had our wedding at Eagle Ridge by Wedgewood Weddings this past October, and it was honestly everything we hoped for. The venue was stunning — the fall colors were out, with red ...

leaves all over the parking lot and beautiful golf course views in the background. Our photographer took us around for pictures, and every spot looked amazing. The tables turned out gorgeous with charger plates and floral arrangements. Our florist, Expressions Floral, had a little trouble finding red roses, but we were able to grab some from Costco and the final setup looked perfect. We also brought in our own photo booth vendor since it was more affordable, and that worked out great too. The coordinators, Jennifer and Kelly, were such a dream to work with. They were quick to respond, easygoing, and super accommodating — even letting us tweak our package about a week and a half before the big day. They made the whole process smooth and stress-free. Our Premier package came with the open bar, and we added our own signature drinks: an espresso martini and a Paloma. We brought cold brew, coffee beans, and cinnamon for the espresso martinis, and everything turned out so well. Our guests loved both drinks and kept complimenting the bartenders. The food was a highlight — everyone raved about it! We served breaded chicken with cream sauce, prime rib, and Alaskan cod. Everything was delicious, though the cod was a little overcooked. Still, the meal was a big hit overall. Our DJ, Brian, did an awesome job reading the crowd and keeping everyone on the dance floor. He met with us beforehand to go over our playlist and made everything feel easy and fun. The getting-ready suites were also really nice — clean, comfortable, and perfect for both sides to get ready separately but still close by. Overall, we had such a great experience with Eagle Ridge. The staff, food, and atmosphere went above and beyond. We couldn’t have asked for a better place to celebrate our day and would absolutely recommend it to other couples!

staff are incredible. Big shout outs to Priscilla, Jennifer, Casey, Kelly and Xochi for making this process easy and our day perfect. We knew our guest list would be big, so we needed a venue that was close to a variety of hotels and also had accommodating parking! Aside from that, Eagle Ridge had that vintage, warm, romantic feel that we were looking for. It was hard to envision as we were going in for meetings what it would be like on a wedding night, but the photos they gave us provided a really good example of what things COULD look like, and the venue far exceeded our expectations on the day of. The ceremony space was beautiful, and didn’t need too much to spruce it up. The venue itself is filled with many photo op worthy places for photographers and guests alike, and I love that the bar is built in. The way that Eagle Ridge is described on the Wedgewood site is 100% accurate to what it feels like on your wedding day. Everything about this day was perfect. We opted out of draping and any arbor draping for the ceremony space because we knew we had chosen a space that was just architecturally beautiful as it is. It’s not often that you can just walk into a venue and be like “yeah, it’s actually so beautiful just the way it is.” I’ll say it again, yes the building and the venue itself is beautiful, but it’s the team that truly makes the experience what it is. If you want to feel taken care of, seen, heard and like you can trust people the moment you go hands off, Eagle Ridge is it. I will be replaying this day over and over and over again in my head for as long as I live, and it’s all thanks to the work that the team that helped us through it all put into it.

It has such pretty views and a lovely ceremony set up. We really appreciated the affordability and flexibility of their inclusive packages. We used many of their preferred vendors which were all amazing. Shoutout to Dj Brian! He was awesome. Every single person who helped us through Eagle Ridge was so kind of helpful.

The venue for the perfect wedding!! Beautiful venue, a professional team, and very easy planning. Highly recommend! I loved the huge newly renovated bridal suits, ceremony site, ...

and cocktail hour space. The reception area is a bit old, but with some magic from pro-prep events, it was easily fixed. Our package: We have got the elite package. Basically, we upgraded everything that can be upgraded. We were taking this into account, the price of the packages at Eagle Ridge is way less than the majority of the venues in the area, so we were able to upgrade almost everything. We included shots at the open bar and it was such a good decision. The cool part we didn't have to pay extra to include shots, and we didn't have any limits at the bar. Very convenient and worry-free setup. Planning: Jeniffer was our wedding planner and she is THE BEST!! I was so happy she was our coordinator on the day of the wedding. She is so friendly, nice, professional, and attentive. She was the reason our wedding went PERFECTLY! Ceremony Site: Honestly this site is so beautiful that you don't need to decorate it with flowers at all. We added flower services from an external vendor (the Wedgewood team was so nice to our external vendors THANK YOU). Also, we upgraded the ceremony chairs. Cocktail hour space and the bar: Just gorgeous space, with a fireplace (we asked to turn it on and it was magical for a somewhat cold November evening). Inside cocktail hour space is somewhat small for 64 guests, but there is a way to go outside and enjoy gorgeous sunset with views of the golf course. Our guests loved it. Reception Site: The reception site is a bit old, I personally had issues with the walls, lol. They are quite old-looking + old flooring. I fixed it with some wall droppings from the recommended vendor "Pro-Prep Events" which worked perfectly. We upgraded all the centerpieces and my vision of the reception site was executed the way I imagine. Food: OMG, food was a bomb! My husband and I weren't eating much because of nerves and stress but our guests loved everything! TIP: ask your wedding coordinator about house favorites, they are favorites for a reason!! We picked short ribs and chicken, and those ribs were sooo good. Service: We did plated service. Everything went flawlessly. All the staff members were so professional and nice.

Well, to start off my husband and I had a unique situation for our wedding day. My husband broke his leg a month before our wedding, so I mentioned to the Wedgewood Team at Eagle ...

Ridge what happened and that he will be going back and forth between his walker and wheelchair throughout the day. They were absolutely understanding and did everything that they could to make this day accommodating for the both of us. Team Members Brittany and Mailani have been helping us with all the details, our questions and concerns since day one of booking. They've always been extremely attentive with emails and upcoming appointments. As for the day of the wedding, it was absolutely perfect! Our photographers Maria and Eric were so incredibly sweet and experienced. Everytime my husband Jonathan needed a break from pictures to rest his leg they were patient and understanding. The manager Carrie, I met the day of our wedding and she was just so charming. She helped me with my bustle because it kept getting undone during the reception. Our DJ Brian was a delight! Great person and extremely talented. Florist, "Flower Divas" and Cake Vendor, "I Do Wedding Cakes" were amazing and everything came out just how I imagined it, plus more! Everything was beautiful & everyone went above and beyond to make our day special. I just want to sincerely thank every team member at Eagle Ridge who made our wedding day possible. It was the best day of our lives even with a broken leg! Again, thank you to all Eagle Ridge Team Members, you're all amazing at what you do!

e. It was also on the cheaper end of the other wedgewood venues I had toured. However, due to COVID I had to postpone my event twice. The venue staff worked with me throughout the process. I felt that once it came around to the wedding timeI wish there had been more assistance by the venue in terms of coordination. I had to figure out the logistics myself with all the different vendors. But overall my big day exceeded my expectations and all my visions came to life. The entire event was from 6:00-11:00 PM, which was one of the things I wish could have been different. The day flew by and I wish the reception could have been longer. But overall I would recommend this venue and am so happy with my choice. The food was great for not trying prior to the wedding. My cake was tossed which was unfortunate as I did not have a piece and was more than enough for the amount of guests that showed up. It is an all inclusive venue which made planning so much easier.

n and talk numbers, then come to realize it’s out of your budget. Wedge wood Eagle ridge did the opposite. We talked numbers, packages, then took the tour and I instantly said “we will take it,” as if I was buying a house. That’s how in love I was with the venue, team and packages from the start. The team did an amazing job at checking in and scheduling follow up appointments. Pricing was spaced out, which elevated a lot of stress. The team was knowledgeable, quick to respond and had great pass off communication. The day before the wedding we went in for the rehearsal. I couldn’t wait to go because I had missed the venue so much. Driving up the road to the venue, instantly had me thinking, this is what my guest will see tomorrow evening. The privately gated community, the breathtaking homes in Eagle Ridge and all the greenery leading up to the gulf course, gave a first great impression of how the rest of the evening would be. The Wedgewood staff was professional, attentive and very welcoming to all of our guest. The food was absolutely amazing, being one of the main reasons for booking this venue. We went with most of the vendors provided by Wedgewood and it couldn’t go more seamless. Brian the DJ had us moving the entire night. That morning of our big day my MOH had asked me what I wanted most out of the day. One being to marry the man of my dreams but the other was to see the dance floor packed all night. And that was exactly what I got. Seeing everyone having a great time, enjoying the food, open bar and finding any picturesque spot in the venue (which there are plenty I might add) made my- now husband extremely happy. It was exactly what we wanted and more. Thank you again Wedgewood Eagleridge! Cheers

I got married at Eagle Ridge in September 14th, 2018 and I am beyond happy with the way my wedding turned out. I was super impressed with their professionalism, and loved how they ...

handled almost everything. This venue is all-inclusive, and they really try to go above and beyond to give the marrying couple everything they want for a very reasonable price. They have quite a few different packages, and allow you to customize your selected package to match exactly what you need. My package included ceremony location, *florist for the centerpieces*, reception area, cocktail hour and bar, 1hr open bar and then beer and wine throughout the night (bar remained open for people who wanted to buy their own cocktails after cocktail hour ended), hour de vours, linens, tables, chairs, wedding coordinator, DJ & microphone, dinner, and cake. The venue is gorgeous, and they allow you to decorate the venue nearly anyway you desire. The wedding coordinators were incredible and were there to help me every step of the way, I seriously cannot give these girls enough praise. The bakery they partner with is amazing as well, and offered a taste testing to choose our wedding cake flavors and design. *My only complaint is the florist they are partnered with. I really hope they have switch florists since my wedding, because that was the only issue I had with them, and it was pretty major. First, I could not get a hold of her. It took literally 2-3 months for her to respond to my calls. When I finally got a hold of her, she emailed me available centerpieces, and the options were very limited. I chose a wooden box with flowers in it and told her I would be putting a lantern in the middle of the box for height. After MANY email attempts, I finally got ahold of her and confirmed the size of the lanterns I wanted to get to ensure they would fit, which she confirmed they would. She suggested I rent them from a specific wedding store she partnered with, and that she would return the lanterns for me. So that is what I did. The day of my wedding, less than 1 hour before I was to walk down the aisle, the wedding coordinator told me the lanterns did not fit in the box, and the florist had told them I ordered the wrong size and was supposed to get smaller ones. I was livid! I showed the coordinator the email confirming the size the florist instructed me to get, and they agreed the florist messed up. I ended up having to get rid of the wooden box and filled the lanterns, that I rented with my own money, with flowers. Then after the wedding, I get a call from the place I rented the lanterns from saying they had never been returned! So not only did I end up paying for my centerpiece, which should have been included in my package, but she did not return the lanterns as promised! Eagle Ridge was amazing and worked through the hiccup with me, but I told them they needed to find a different florist because she was impossible to get a hold of, and was not reliable AT ALL. Honestly though, EVERY THING ELSE WAS PERFECT! Eagle Ridge is incredible and I highly suggest this venue. Just make sure they have switched florists recently, or do not bother including the centerpieces in your package, and handle those yourself.

e me feel excited, was stone face, rude and seemed totally irritated the entire time. I had asked if she would provide a few extra chairs during the ceremony just in case the guest list wasn’t correct. She wouldn’t. Of course the total guest count was not accurate, as there were about 10-12 more people that just showed up. Not my fault, I do not agree with it. However, it is my wedding day and I refuse to get upset. Well, the “wedding planner” had to get the seats for the guest for dinner. She did, (and didn’t provide them the chairs I had paid the upgrade for so I had the ones I chose and the office looking ones they provide.) We had the first three tables in front of the head table reserved for our parents and wedding party, her job was to make sure no one else sits there. Well, none of my family nor my wedding party were seated there. I was really upset, obviously. The worst thing was when she approached my parents, DURING dinner and in the middle of a conversation with people and rudely interrupts, “you owe me money!” I was shocked and embarrassed to hear this, especially in front of other guests.

t style. Overall I did have a fun night and there were a lot of good that happened during the wedding but a few bad experiences too. Pros of the night: Organized in the sense of planning everything. DJ Brian was AWESOME at being on time and completing all the requests I had in terms of music. Christina answered all my questions everytime so I felt NO stress before and during the ceremony. The 2 captains helping us get our food was good because I'd be so afraid to accidentally drop my plate, they were also the ones helping me address the no show situation that I had to deal with in the middle of my wedding. Food tasted SO good. We got the salmon and panko chicken and the carving meat was beef. The officiant was also very good and made my ceremony feel so special. The bartender was AMAZING and everyone was so happy with him. I upgraded the linens and the lighting and it made everything look so beautiful. I made a lot of my own decor for the ceremony and reception and added coordination services so they would set it all up. They were sooo great and followed everything I asked! All the details were there. Cons of the night: -1 star because their add on of espresso and waffle cart that I had added to my package 6 months in advance did not show up. No one had informed me they were not coming and thankfully my maid of honor noticed something was missing. It was just disappointing because I had told my friends I wouldn't do my big dessert table since there was going to be espresso and waffles. Thankfully since we were able to address it in the middle of the reception I got a refund for it and an extra 30 min of open bar. But if my maid of honor had not told me I probably would have paid a large amount of money for something that wasn't even there. The only reasoning they gave me for him not showing up was a scheduling issue so I have no idea who is to blame for that really. If I had known ahead of time I could have booked my own dessert vendor. -1 star because I was later told by my guests at the last few tables that there was not much food left so they didn't really get to eat. They had to go out to eat after the wedding. I had paid for buffet style and I thought they would make enough for everyone. I had been to another wedgewood event at another location before for a wedding and they kept making food if it was not enough. Even the cake portion was all off because many people did not get to try it or were not served it because there was not enough. Another con that I won't take off a star for was that I gave the organizers glowsticks to give to the DJ so he can hand them out during dance time. They were not given out. There were over 200 glow sticks. I have no idea where they went or what happened to them. I was busy the whole night I didn't notice til the next week when I was talking to my wedding party about it. I didn't get it back and went straight to my honeymoon after the wedding so I couldn't even go there to pick it up if I had noticed.

I am sure I talked to everyone that worked there over email and they all very quick to respond to me. Which was one of the main reasons we decided to go with Eagle Ridge they were on it when it came to communicating with us . The venue is beautiful and there are gorgeous houses all around. We would choose this venue over again if we got a redo. We are beyond happy with everything. The food was delicious and the service from the catering was awesome.
