Max Kuksin

Co-founder, video operator, montage editor

Maxim’s journey in visual arts began in 1986 with photography, where he focused on capturing nature and environmental issues. His work was published in the early 1990s, marking the beginning of a lifelong passion for visual storytelling. In the late '90s, Maxim transitioned into wedding and event videography, drawn by the emotional depth and the opportunity to preserve life’s most meaningful moments. With a deep sense of responsibility and dedication, Maxim approaches each project with the understanding of how significant these memories are to his clients. His goal is not only to document events but to authentically capture the emotions and beauty of each special day. In his creative process, Maxim favors natural color tones in his grading. While trends in color correction come and go, he believes that classic, timeless styles will always remain in vogue.

Alina was amazing to work with. From our first consultation to the day of the wedding, she made the process seamless and straightforward! She listened carefully to what our expecta...

tions were, and how she would make it happen. On the actually wedding day, she brought such a calm energy that allowed my wife and I both to just relax and enjoy the day. She was not pushy when it came to anything, she gave us clear instructions for what to do for specific posing situations and she made group video/photo sessions a breeze. So in terms of capturing our first looks, to the ceremony and then to the reception for our speeches and first dance, she was so professional and captured it all beautifully. In my opinion, the best part of Alina’s videography was when the party started during the reception. I say that because it felt like she was on the dance floor with us as a guest! It was amazing how she was running around capturing cool moments and being present! There was this once specific moment I remember of her running through our snake dance line getting a first person POV of what our guests were experiencing! She was so full of energy and brought the best vibes as a videographer. If you want someone professional, thoughtful, and easy to work with, go with Alina. You will not be disappointed.

Response from A&M FILMS on 12/16/2025

Dear Shahid & Vanessa, thank you so much for your incredibly thoughtful and kind review. I...

truly appreciate you taking the time to share your experience, and I am very grateful for your words. From our first consultation, my priority was to make the process feel smooth, comfortable, and enjoyable, so it means a lot to know you felt relaxed and supported throughout the day. Being able to capture both the meaningful moments and the fun, high-energy parts of your celebration especially during the reception was an absolute joy. We loved documenting your beautiful day! Thank you for trusting us to preserve these memories. Wishing you a lifetime filled with love, laughter, and beautiful moments together!
