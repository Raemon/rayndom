to detail, and calm professionalism made the entire process feel seamless. But what really stood out was her warmth and care — she brought such thoughtfulness to every interaction and decision. Vanessa took the time to truly understand us as a couple and ensured that our wedding reflected who we are. She was attentive, intuitive, and proactive, often anticipating our needs before we even realized them. What could have been a stressful process became enjoyable and creative, thanks to her steady guidance and kindness. When the wedding weekend arrived, we were in awe of the care and precision she put into every element. Vanessa seamlessly managed a complex two-day build-out for our wedding day, many many vendors, a rehearsal, and a welcome party and we were able to just enjoy the celebrations with zero concerns. Beyond her professionalism and talent, Vanessa is simply a wonderful person to work with: kind, thoughtful, and deeply committed to her clients. We’re endlessly grateful to have had her as our planner and couldn’t recommend her more highly!

awlessly orchestrated our multi-day celebration, ensuring every single detail was beyond perfection. Vanessa was an absolute joy to work with—organized, always accessible, and incredibly responsive. She took the time to truly listen to our vision and transformed it into a breathtaking reality. Every element, from the elegant beach ceremony and the stunning floral arrangements to the elegant signage and world-class entertainment, was meticulously curated. Her vendor recommendations were spot on, bringing together the most talented professionals who exceeded our expectations in every way. Our guests were absolutely blown away, and we were left speechless by the level of care and thoughtfulness Vanessa poured into every moment. The special touches, the seamless execution, and her ability to anticipate every need made our wedding experience completely stress-free and magical. Vanessa and her team are not just wedding planners—they are visionaries, artists, and the hardest-working professionals you could ever hope to have by your side. If you want the wedding of your dreams, look no further. We are forever grateful!

Vanessa was spectacular from start to finish! It was the best decision to have her as our wedding planner. My husband and I are busy people and we were not stressing all throughout...

the whole process (except for maybe the weather which was out of our control — but even then she put in all efforts to mitigate that!) My main goal for the wedding was to feel like a guest and enjoy every aspect of it myself — and Vanessa delivered. We gave Vanessa creative freedom and her design & planning was immaculate. Vanessa executed a flawless wedding that was detailed and colorful to represent us and connected us with the best vendors to provide the best experience — guests did not stop talking about it afterwards! If there is one thing to do truly invest in for your wedding — it’s a professional & experienced wedding planner like Vanessa. We absolutely would not have had experience without her — and we are still trying to relieve that perfect day!

ionalism and warmth that exceeded all expectations. Her deep knowledge of the Napa area was evident as she guided us to the most breathtaking venues and top-notch vendors. She took the time to understand our vision, style, and budget, curating options that were perfectly tailored to us. Every detail was thoughtfully considered, from the exquisite floral arrangements to the seamless timeline of the day. What truly set Vanessa apart was her impeccable attention to detail and her calming presence. Planning a wedding from across the country can be overwhelming, but she made the entire process enjoyable and stress-free. On the day of the wedding, we were able to fully immerse ourselves in the joy of the moment, knowing that she had everything under control. Our guests are still raving about how beautiful and smoothly run our wedding was. We owe it all to Vanessa’s dedication, creativity, and hard work. Hiring her was the best decision we made, and we can't recommend her highly enough! Thank you, Vanessa, for making our wedding day the most magical and memorable experience of our lives.

dly wedding with a high/low dining concept. She helped us find the perfect venue in wine country (given our laundry list of requirements) and had amazing vendor connections. At every step she provided a shortlist of 2-4 vendors she thought would work for us which made picking out flowers, a photographer, catering, tableware, etc. super easy and enjoyable. She and her team also handled all the day-of coordination so we could be present with each other and our guests throughout the day. Vanessa is extremely professional and organized, but also brings a calming vibe to a planning process that feels high-stakes and overwhelming at times. Vanessa's attention to detail and her ability to handle any situation is truly impressive. We couldn't have asked for a better wedding planner or a more perfect wedding!

lanning but the second I met Vanessa I knew she was exactly what I'd been hoping to find. Her professionalism, thoroughness, incredible taste and calm presence made the entire planning process not only stress-free but FUN. Over the course of our time planning I constantly found myself telling her that so many people were asking me if I was stressed and I could genuinely say, "Nope!" because I wasn't! She took all the hassle out of the process and felt like a true partner every step of the way. Our day was better than we could have ever imagined and we were able to enjoy every second of the process from start to finish. If I could give 100 more stars I would! Thank you, Vanessa!!

Five stars does not feel like a good enough representation for what Vanessa is not only capable of, but what she does. My husband and I could not, absolutely could not have had the...

wedding we did without Vanessa. We initiated the planning process on our own, even had both the ceremony location and venue booked. We then wrongly assumed those were the biggest tasks at hand and that it would be “easy” from there. We couldn’t have been more wrong. We decided at that point to look into hiring a wedding planner. We had gotten referrals for a few planners through friends of friends and met with multiple people. All of which were a no, for one reason or another. Then, my husband found Vanessa through Google and the rest of the process became a completely different experience. I knew within two minutes of being on Zoom with Vanessa that I wanted her to be a part of our day. Vanessa is very kind hearted and will make you feel so excited about your wedding while she takes on the stress and responsibility for you. Not only did Vanessa bring our version to life once, she did it twice. Vanessa completed floorplans, attended multiple meetings with us to the venues we had booked, spent months and months bringing our vision to life, only for us to change our minds a few months before the wedding. What was initially planned as a nearly 200-person wedding in SF was turned into less than 20 people in our backyard. When my husband and I approached Vanessa about the change we wanted to make, we were certain we would have to part ways. Not only didn’t Vanessa completely support our decision, she was willing to stay on as our wedding planner and see our day through. She recreated our vision, sought our additional vendors, and transformed our home into our dream venue. Besides every detail of the wedding being perfected and accounted for, the other thing Vanessa contributes is vendors who are just as talented as she is. Every single vendor that played a part in our day was so lovely to work with and saw their portion through to the fullest. I cannot recommend Vanessa enough; she truly is one of a kind. XO

t the time just how much the word – Invaluable – would prove to be an understatement. From our first call with Vanessa, we knew she was the perfect fit to lead our team! She was born for events planning. Never batting an eye at our wild ideas - Vanessa went above and beyond to make magic happen. From matchbox save-the-dates to a violinist playing Frank Ocean, Vanessa’s imagination pushed the boundaries of the mainstream wedding industry – creating a day that was uniquely and impressively us. Moreover, Vanessa’s impressive list of industry connections made for endless possibilities. Florists, stationers, and MUAs alike – my husband and I didn’t meet with a single vendor who failed to sing Vanessa’s praises (and for good reason!). Now, more than four months since, our wedding is still a constant conversation among family and friends – speaking volumes of the work produced by VPE. In planning our wedding together, we gained a lifelong friend, of which we are so thankful.

Vanessa helped build our venue from the ground up, coordinating with many vendors and stakeholders, to execute a flawless event. Vanessa took the time to really get to know my husband and me. She helped us prioritize what was most important to us, and she kept those factors as non-negotiables in our wedding (all while managing our budget). Vanessa meticulously planned our wedding day logistics and vendor drop-off. The day of planning was so seamless that we spent the day completely focused on each other and our guests.

My husband and I want to preface that we would give Vanessa ten stars if that was an option! We originally thought we could plan the wedding ourselves…and then quickly realized w...

e had no idea what to do and became overwhelmed with how many choices there were for every aspect of the wedding. This is where Vanessa was invaluable. She invested time in not only understanding our vision, but us as a couple and our personalities. This made it feel like we were working with a friend that we trusted completely. Because of this trust, we heavily leaned on Vanessa for design aesthetic and relied on her for decisions. Her confidence helped us feel confident. As an indecisive person, being presented 20 options/ideas for something would have overwhelmed me. Instead, Vanessa filtered down the options for everything and presented the ones she thought were best. This saved us so much stress and shows how Vanessa personalizes her approach to what is helpful for the client. Vanessa’s ideas turned out to fit perfectly into our vision and the day-of ended up being beyond magical for us and our guests. Additionally, she kept us on track and accountable for the items we had to execute on to make sure we didn’t fall behind. Her set up in Aisle Planner was seamless and she helped us navigate every step of the way. We look back on our wedding day with the happiest memories and most importantly, the best feelings. Because of Vanessa, we weren’t stressed, overwhelmed, or worried the day of our wedding. We were just able to be in the moment and enjoy. Everything went perfectly, looked amazing, and was truly the happiest day of our lives. That’s genuinely all due to Vanessa. We can't recommend working with her enough!

and and an all around good human...but she was incredibly professional and warm from the very beginning, knocking out every single detail to make our dream day come true. When we had to last minute change our venue in Napa, Vanessa went above and beyond to ensure a smooth transition including a complete redesign!! Vanessa was also always there for me (the bride) when I needed her and was stressed.
