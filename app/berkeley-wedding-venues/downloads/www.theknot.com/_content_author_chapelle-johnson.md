Chapelle is an Associate Editor at The Knot Worldwide, where she focuses on everything from wedding advice to the latest industry trends. She has several years of editorial experience and is excited to help couples and to-be-weds with essential wedding planning tips and unique ideas.

Chapelle grew up in Atlanta, Georgia and currently lives in New Orleans, Louisiana. When she has free time, she loves cooking Italian food (who can live without pasta and garlic?!), thrift shopping for graphic tees, and looking at pictures of Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, her dream dog, on Instagram.

## Experience

She started her writing career in 2018 as an editorial intern for _NOLA Family Magazine_ and _Boomers Magazine_. After this, her love for journalism blossomed. Over the next couple of years, she worked as an editorial intern for the _New Orleans Review_ and _Subvrt Magazine_ , where she reviewed submitted manuscripts, interviewed entrepreneurs, and wrote articles. In between internships, Chapelle focused on features and creative writing. She wrote for _433 Magazine_ , an online art and literature magazine, interviewed best-selling young adult author Leah Johnson about her debut novel, _You Should See Me in a Crown_ , for _New Orleans Review_ , and fact-checked the book manuscript of T.V. by Susan Bordo.

## Education

Chapelle graduated from Loyola University New Orleans, where she majored in English writing. Her favorite courses involved creative writing, where she loved writing ominous short stories, working on her screenplay, and writing essays about parallels in the work by Charles Dickens and Shonda Rhimes, and how they became some of the best storytellers. In her senior year, she received a Certificate in Editing and Publishing.

## Important Questions From The Knot Q&A

### Best advice for to-be-weds? 

Try to be flexible. You and your partner will face some hiccups during the wedding planning process, but try to compromise with one another and yourself. Work together to get through your wedding to-do list early on, so your only worry during the wedding is having too much fun!

### What's your all-time favorite wedding song?

Thanks to the _Twilight_ craze, which I will not deny I was very much a part of, Bella and Edward's wedding song "Turning Page" by Sleeping at Last is the best wedding song (warning: this song can make anyone cry).

### Dream celebrity wedding guest?

I would be honored to have FKA Twigs as my celebrity wedding guest. FKA Twigs is an amazing performer, so I would love it if she would teach me some moves to use on the dance floor.

### Best wedding after party snack?

It would have to be three buckets of my favorite ice cream: cookies 'n cream, strawberry, and rainbow sherbet. I always have something salty to eat with sweet snacks, so I'd serve some pickles too!
