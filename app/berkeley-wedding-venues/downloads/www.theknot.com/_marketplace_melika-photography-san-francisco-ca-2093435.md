From the very beginning, Melika was clear, responsive, and full of positive energy. She answered all our questions with so much patience and made everything feel easy and organized...

. On the day of the wedding, she moved effortlessly—capturing moments from every angle without ever feeling intrusive. She managed the family photos smoothly, and somehow even got a great shot of all our guests! We're so happy with the quality of the photos and the genuine love she puts into her work. You can truly feel it in every image.

Having Melika as my photographer was such a wonderful experience! Her sweet energy and vibe made my wedding photos even more beautiful. Moreover, I was very stressed on my big day ...

because my makeup artist didn’t show up, and I had to make a lot of changes to our schedule. However, she was understanding about my situation and accommodated the changes. With that being said, and considering the affordable price that she offers, I 100% recommend her!
