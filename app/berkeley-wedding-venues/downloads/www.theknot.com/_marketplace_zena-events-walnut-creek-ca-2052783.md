Christina went the extra mile, helping us source the perfect linens and sharing creative ideas that made the event even more special. She worked seamlessly with our vendors and brought along a few great team members who were also a huge help. Christina’s organization, professionalism, and eye for detail were invaluable, allowing us to relax and enjoy our day. We’re so grateful to have had her support in making our wedding unforgettable!

Christina was highly recommended to me by a family friend who had her services at their wedding. I am SO grateful for this introduction, Christina was a lifesaver for my wedding. I...

had a big Greek wedding with about 260 people and a wedding party of 19. I am a DIY bride and originally planned to do a lot of setups myself, but when the schedule took a turn and I was unable to do anything the night before, Christina stepped in and took care of it all. She set up everything we brought in with her team, bringing my long-awaited vision of my dream wedding to life! I had a cake fiasco (my vendor forgot to bake and bring my cake!) and Christina's team maneuvered to make sure the bakery brought a cake for us to cut later in the night. The guests had no idea it even happened. She also took care of so many things throughout the day that I didn't even know I needed. Christina and her team were truly a pleasure to work with. All of our guests cannot stop saying that it was the best wedding they have ever been to! The Zena Events team was kind, passionate, and professional in every scenario (even with very opinionated Greek moms!), and I hope I can work with them again for a major event. If you need a reliable and amazing wedding planner, look no further!!

Zena Events was recommended by many friends and it was one of the best decisions we made. From the first time we met, Christina was very thoughtful and asked about our vision, an...

y themes, the vibe we are going for, and traditions that need to be part our day. She recommended many great and talented vendors that we also hired. Christina worked with them from our first call all the way through our wedding day making sure everything agreed upon was considered and included. She helped with many extra details I was looking to add and executed them better than I was invisioning. All of the effort and Work Christina put into the planning turned out to be nothing compared to what she put in the wedding day! Christina was with us from the early start of the day, making sure every last detail was taken care of. Christina and her team took care of everything that day!! And I mean everything!! Making sure vendors were on time, where they should set up, making sure the bridal party was hydrated and comfortable, responding to any last minutes hiccups and making sure everything ran perfectly!! She got to know us, our families, and our wishes for the wedding so well that she was able to facilitate everything as if it was us. Do not hesitate and do not stress on your big day and hire Zena Events!

We originally had another wedding coordinator and had to fire her one month before our wedding. We found Christina, and she immediately stepped in and provided the peace we were lo...

oking for as our big day was approaching. Christina was BEYOND amazing. For having one month only to catch up and prep, Christina handled everything so gracefully and did not give us any doubts or hesitations. As we were hammering down final details, she was involved, troubleshooted, and advocated for our wants/needs when the odds were not in our favor (with our venue specifically). The week leading up to the wedding Christina, handled all last minute wedding details, showed up to our dress rehearsal, even worked all day/night the day before our wedding and smiled the whole time. Christina did not make any of the hiccups during the wedding noticeable and pivoted when needed. Christina has many years of experience with weddings, especially large ethnic (arab) weddings and we wish we had found her when we were first planning our wedding. Please do yourself a favor in an already chaotic time and hire Christina as your wedding planner! :)

They say: "Your wedding day is supposed to be the happiest AND most stressful day of your life...." Well, THEY LIED!! What stress? :) With Christina by our side, the most stressfu...

l part was worrying which story the Best Man was going to share in front of our families! Christina truly made this the happiest and most beautiful day of our lives, and truly worry free! If you are looking for someone who will go above and beyond for any and every event, look no further! We've had the pleasure of working with Christina for our wedding and then again for our baby shower; and we were blown away both times! Her attention to detail is amazing, (spreadsheets, diagrams, shared docs, the whole shabang!) she makes it clear that your happiness is her priority. She also has a disgusting amount of relationships in the industry, not sure how she remembers everyones names and info, but anything we asked for (even strange unique asks) she was able to give an intro to someone who can help, AND even give a couple references to make sure we keep everyone honest in regards to top quality AND pricing of course. We definitely plan to use her again for more events in the future, and will selfishly even plan events around her availability!!

nce the bigger parts of the wedding day were done, and I can’t even come close to thanking her enough for being my go-to that day. From the moment I woke up for hair and makeup, I was already stressed and anxious, wanting the big day to go perfectly. The second Christina walked into the hotel room, I felt like I could breathe, and she was the only one that was able to make me feel relaxed. She was the main contact for every one of my vendors, and she somehow was able to be at three places at once. The months leading up to the wedding, I felt nervous about things going wrong; however because of Christina, everything happened without any incident or hiccup. In fact, every family member and friend that attended the wedding were impressed at just how smooth the day went, and said that it was the best wedding they’ve been to. I owe everything to her for making my every dream come true! She seriously will make your big day a success and better than you could have dreamed!

There are not enough words to explain how amazing Christina was during this stressful time of our life. She was there for more ways than I needed and executed every task and more. ...

I couldn’t imagine where that day would have gone without her being there every step of the way. She worked with my vendors and treated them all with such grace and respect and all became a team and helped me have my dream wedding. I can now officially say I had my dream wedding and that’s only because of Christina. I had no worries the day of as she had taken care of every last detail. 100% recommend hiring her because no one can survive without her in my opinion lol. She not only was my wedding planner but also became one of my closest friends.
