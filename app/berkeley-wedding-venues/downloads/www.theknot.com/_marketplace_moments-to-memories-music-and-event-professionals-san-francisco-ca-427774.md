His setup and teardown went off without a hitch. And the sound and volume were perfect. We also decided to go with their photobooth package which was a big hit with our guests. The scrapbook we received at the end of the night was just icing on the cake. I highly recommend Moments to Memories and would go to them again for any future events.

Bart made us feel comfortable and we had a blast talking to him. On our big day, we had the worst storm Morgan Hill had seen in December. Even with this storm, he was professional and made our wedding run smooth with from before ceremony to end of the end of the night. We had a BLAST and so many guests complimented us on our music and entertainment. We also rented the Photobooth with Bart, which is definite must! Our guests (and us) loved it and it kept guests entertained. Thank you Bart for helping us so last minute- we are so glad to have worked with you! Natasha & Justin

He provided excellent tips to plan the wedding day out smoothly. Robert was prepared, supported our ideas, and we're so happy to say the day was beautiful. There were no technical or musical issues or concerns. He played a well-rounded combination of modern music with classics so all ages were on the dance floor during the night. Technically, he was very sound and his experience showed. The photo booth surpassed my expectations! The set-up, staff, and photos were a huge feature at the wedding and all the guests enjoyed it so much. You're really getting a professional duo for a very good price point compared to competitors in the Sacramento area. Thank you so much!

ose to work with them. While we knew Bart was a very in-demand DJ, we always felt like we were a top priority, even during the busy season. We had several meetings with him via video chat prior to our big day, and found Bart to be very easy to work with, and we felt very comfortable with both his wedding experience (logistics can be complicated), and his music knowledge and taste. We had some very specific requests (we had an outdoor tea ceremony and cocktail hour, and an indoor ceremony and reception) and Bart accommodated for all of them easily. I never felt like I was asking too much, and because Bart has clearly seen so many different wedding iterations, it all seemed to come together pretty effortlessly. The music felt both familiar and interesting. We had a playlist that we shared in advance, and we were both really happy with the direction that it went through the night. There was a custom remix that I requested, and it was an absolute highlight of the night to hear it. I should also add that Bart is a very nice guy, and all of the guests and vendors who got to interact with him had nothing but positive things to say. There is a reason why Moments to Memories has so many great reviews. We would happily recommend them to any of our friends and family!

My wife Stephanie and I were beyond happy to have Bart DJ for our wedding. He was professional, courteous, timely, and worked with us in all of our needs. Not only did he provide m...

usic but he also emceed for the whole event which made the wedding much more dynamic. Having someone who is a great public speaker and can read a crowd goes a long way towards creating a more engaging and memorable experience. He took the time to meet with us on multiple occasions leading up to our wedding where we discussed scheduling, songs, microphone details for toasts and the officiant, and much more. He even took things a step further by bringing extra lighting to the venue to help with the ambiance. As someone who is a professional musician I can also say that Bart exceeds the standard of a professional DJ by also himself being a professional musician. This made communicating about music choices so much more easy. He was able to provide excellent suggestions about the flow of songs, playlists, and timing of dances. While he made great suggestions he was never pushy and always told us to trust whatever our gut feeling was. I highly encourage you to hire Bart for your wedding! He had the whole crowd dancing all evening and made sure everyone was having a good time. You will definitely be happy with his work ethic and the energy he can bring to a wedding.

imeline for the night with important songs ( special dances, cocktail hour, dinner, ceremony, etc) and once more the week before the wedding to go over everything once more. He was also very prompt at responding to emails. We gave him over 200 songs to play with, and told him if you he had a song he thought would work go for it. People did not stop dancing until they venue closed. My one request from him was to play Persian music and he was able to mix Persian music with hip hop and people loved it( he had never listened to Persian music before). His equipment is also top notch sound was magnificent. Oh and his wife runs their Photo Booth and she was awesome, she scrapbooks a memory book for you that night and has all the guests who take photos sign it. We recommend Bart and his wife to everyone!

The day of the event Bart rolled with the punches, from the schedule being messed up due to the food needing to come out sooner to my dad adding a dance in on the spot for my brothers and I. There aren't many dancers in our families, but everyone on the floor enjoyed themselves. Thank you so much Bart!!

I highly recommend moments to memories and DJ Rob! Rob spoke with us twice before the wedding and helped us out a lot with planning our reception, drawing on his experience working...

other weddings! During the reception, Rob MC’ed the event very well, helping us stay on time while we talked to our guests. Once the party began, Rob did a great job with the music, reading the crowd and working in our requests. The dance floor was full of both younger and older guests until the reception ended. My wedding was the best night of my life and Rob played a large role in making in as great as it was!

ception to keep us on track. He also helped me put together was music to play at different times. He helped me totally customize the music for the wedding and reception. His wife was also amazing - we were running late for our entrance to the reception because we couldn’t find the bussle for my dress but she came to the rescue! Her photo booth was also a huge hit. We used the photo strips in a book as our guest book. Nothing but amazing things to say about Bart - thank you so much for making my wedding perfect!

ave happened without Bart. He was such a pleasure to work with... He had incredibly kind and easygoing energy, which made us feel so comfortable and confident. Our dance party was SO fun! The dance floor was packed start to finish. So many of our guests complimented Bart and said it was the best wedding dance party they'd ever seen. Needless to say, we very highly recommend Bart!

Bart and Diana were amazing! Bart made the months prior less stressful by answering any questions/ concerns etc. The day of Bart made everything run smoothly with the perfect music...

. He checked on us to be sure we were ready for what was next. Then the photo booth was an extreme hit! Everyone loved it and Diana was so much fun! She made a perfect photo book that I love & cherish! We received so many compliments on the dj and Photobooth. Diana and Bart made all this possible. I will definitely refer them in the future! Thanks so much!

The music was wonderfully played, timing was perfect, and he checked in on us making sure everything was the way we wanted every step of the way. And the Photobooth, oh Diana was so wonderful. Friends and families can not stop talking about how much fun it was at the Photobooth! The photo album was so perfectly made just for me. I loved everything about these two. Definitely looking forward to booking them again for future events, not only for my husband and myself but for future weddings in the family! Love you Bart and Diana!

go. My hair and makeup took longer than expected so we had to keep pushing back the ceremony start time, Bart handled it beautiful! We also had some delays with dinner not being ready and beacause of Bart our guest didn’t even notice the delay. When it came time to dance, we had the time of our lives! Bart did a great job getting our guest pumped up to dance and celebrate us! I honestly didn’t want the night to end because Bart made it so fun! We are so grateful to Bart and his professionalism. Thank your for making our day unforgettable!

lped me form the plan for wedding day. He helped me come up with our timeline for our wedding, which by the way you will need for your photographer, and you can tell he's great at what at he does. Helped me outline the wedding, was phenomenal day of with talking to members of bridal shower and family to get them ready for toasts, father-daughter dance, walk in music, I tell ya! This guy thought of stuff I did not and that's great when you're planning a wedding to have vendors fill in the blanks or bring ideas that make your day more special. My parents and guests even commented on how much they liked our DJ and how on top of it he was. I would highly recommend Bart and Moment to Memories to be your DJ!

Wow. I cannot say enough good things about Bart. He was very professional, while also being warm, friendly and so, so easy to work with from the beginning. He welcomed any ideas we...

had and was quick to answer any questions or concerns that cropped up along the way. You can plan and schedule things down to a tee, but odds are, not everything will go according to plan and when timing changed throughout the night, Bart was quick to adapt and kept the party going, without giving us any stress. All of our guests could not stop talking about how truly wonderful he was and he was able to keep everyone on the dance floor until the very end (including me in my giant dress and heels!). Out of all of our vendors, he was the only one that we had not a single concern with during the entire process. Snatch this one up before he books up! He will not disappoint you, I promise!

ut anything. They came in, set up the photo booth, and manned it the entire time to help guests with their props and taking pictures. In addition, they took one copy of each picture and created the most precious scrapbook where they had all of our guests sign their own silly photos. It is the most special reminder I have of the wonderful, wild night we had together. I would absolutely recommend them if you want to have an amazing time and have a keepsake to remember the fun you had on your magical night!

ing when the day came around. Unfortunately my venue was disinclined to allow outside DJs onto their property due to some noise ordinance rules they had. I had Bart call the venue operator and after speaking with him on the phone Mike was impressed with his professionalism and excited to add him as a vendor. Additionally, my wedding coordinator had nothing but great things to say about how polite, flexible, and accommodating he was. Additionally on my end Bart made himself 100% available to discuss our needs and wants for the wedding and was very open to the idea of playing unique Romanian songs outside the normal DJ realm for weddings. All in all my day went smoothly and perfectly with no hiccups in sound, equipment, or scheduling and I know Bart was a large part of that success. I HIGHLY recommend you choose his services!

Bart is amazing!! He was absolutely by far one of our favorite vendors to work with for our wedding. From the beginning, he was very professional and open to our ideas. For things ...

we weren't as sure about, he helped guide us through the entire process. We had some very specific ideas on songs and pretty much built up our own playlist for different parts of wedding day, and Bart worked with what we had an added even more on top of it! He's a fantastic DJ and is really great at understanding your music style and working with it. His prices are also extremely reasonable as well. The day of the wedding, Bart flawlessly executed everything (and bonus for his sharp wardrobe :) he looked amazing!) and was also an excellent "host" to our guests. There were several instances throughout the night when we saw him grabbing drinks for our friends and being the middle man between us and our coordinator. We super appreciated the extra pair of hands and Bart went above and beyond for our day. Seriously, we can't sing enough praise for how wonderful of a person and DJ he is, and you're totally missing out if you don't hire him for your event!! We love you Bart! :)

job keeping the evening flowing for us after the planner left. His emcee skills were non invasive and professional. He said just what he needed to and kept the wedding about us, not him. As for music, he truly played exactly what we had requested and and was able to add obscure music requested such as a Greek song, I needed. He provided us with great equipment including a great lapel microphone for the officiant to wear during our ceremony and speakers in multiple areas for cocktail hour, dinner and dancing. I would recommend Bart without hesitation. He is a confident wedding DJ that takes his job seriously and ensures that your wedding desires are met. Thank you Bart!
