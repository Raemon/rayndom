Description

The Lacey gown is a beautifully tailored floral jacquard design featuring an A-line silhouette and an off-shoulder V-neckline with elegant cold shoulder details and delicate shoulder straps. Light pleating on the bodice and a softly pleated skirt with hidden pockets add graceful movement and modern functionality, making it a perfect choice for the mother of the bride or any sophisticated formal event.
