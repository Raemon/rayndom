My experience shopping for my dress at Lovely Bride SF was nothing short of lovely! I went to two other bridal shops in San Francisco, and found that Lovely Bride had the absolute ...

best selection of styles that I loved that were actually in my budget. I had a good problem to have, which is that a lot of the dresses looked great on me, and Trina, who was my stylist at my first appointment, was incredibly helpful. She gave her professional opinion when I desperately needed it (decision making is especially tough when all of the options are so good)! All of my follow up appointments, including when I said yes to the dress, were with Zen, who was also an absolute joy to work with! She was very knowledgable and kind, and made me feel so at ease. I purchased both my dress and veil at Lovely, and the experience was so wonderful. My dress was absolutely gorgeous and flawless, and my veil was perfect! Photos by Aly Tovar Photography @alytovar

I’m really not one for writing reviews. As a wedding vendor myself, I understand how damaging negative reviews can be in this industry. However, this bridal shop deserves every oun...

ce of extremely PUBLIC, negative feedback. I’m embarrassed to say that people like the owner, Heather Hyman, exist in this business. After several attempts to contact the owner or quite frankly, even get a response from anyone in management, my sister is left without a dress 4 months before her wedding date, because this bridal shop made terrible mistakes. They still have yet to make any sort of an apology or even own up to any wrongdoing. They ordered her a dress many sizes too small. Promised her she could walk out the door with a guarantee that a tailor could let it out enough to make it work. This was not the case and the tailor herself told my sister the dress needed to make it right. Even the consultants at this store admitted to her that they were having issues with sizing in with this particular designer. At no point did anyone in management attempt to make any sort of an apology or make it right. Instead of working with her, they flat out IGNORED my sister after several attempts to settle this privately. After making an appointment to try and explain once more her disappointment , hoping that someone would at least SYMPATHIZE, her consultant called out sick and the owner sent her an email. No call. This is an embarrassing display of customer service. Shame on you, Heather. Ladies, go ANYWHERE else but this shop for your needs.

If I could give this bridal shop negative stars, there wouldn't be enough to properly explain how disgusting and poor the customer service is at this shop. My dress was ordered by...

the store manager Lizzie, and as soon as it arrived it clearly was ordered too small. Lizzie took absolutely no responsibility that she ordered the dress too small and instead tried to blame me claiming my butt had grown a few CENTIMETERS. Even if that was true, which I will never know because my measurements were never handed to me in person, Lizzie should have ordered it bigger obviously. On top of that, a sales associate told me in private that this has been happening a lot with the designer, that Lizzie has been ordering the dresses too small. I sent Lizzie an email privately after the weekend trying to tell her how awful I felt and how I felt she put all the blame on me taking no responsibility whatsoever. To this day, I have not received a reply. She then PROMISED me that a tailor would fix the issues no problem. At this point I could have left the dress and eaten the first portion of the dress cost, but Lizzie promised me it was fixable. I took her word, and her word is crap. I visited multiple tailors including the one Lizzie herself said could fix the issue, and got the tailor on video explaining they ordered the dress 2 sizes too small and its not fixable. The tailor even tried to call Lizzie as the two had previously worked together, and Lizzie ignored everyones calls. Lastly, I showed up to the store with an appointment demanding a refund as this dress was now ruined for me, and Lizzie was magically out sick that day. She made her sales associate talk to me while she called the owner. The owner, Heather Hyman, had no sympathy, took no responsibility and blew off the entire thing. This was the most horrific and traumatizing wedding dress experience I could imagine for anyone, and you are doing yourself a favor if you avoid this store like the plague. This was an absolutely nightmare.

I don’t leave poor reviews lightly but If I could leave 0 stars I would. Short story- horrible customer service, don’t know how to correctly order sizing and not willing to own a...

nd fix their own mistakes Long story- My best friend paid to rent out the entire shop in December to have a fun group come while she tried on dresses. She picked out a beautiful dress from this store. She made an investment for a dress she loved. Unfortunately the staff at this store measured her incorrectly and ordered a dress 2-3 sizes too small. They then convinced her the dress would be able to be fixed at a seamstress that they recommended (who, when remeasuring, confirmed the initial measurements were inaccurate). The dress could not be altered correctly due to being completely the wrong size. This store has taken zero responsibility, has offered NOTHING to fix THEIR mistake, has made my best friend feel HORRIBLE (they made her feel she must’ve gained INCHES in a few months- not the case at all) and Lizzie and Heather (store manager and owner) have absolutely no customer service skills. Zero class as humans and business owners. She now has 4 months until her wedding and no dress, and is out all the money she invested into this dress. Take your business somewhere else

ly hit the nail on the head after I showed her some photos of dresses I had been looking at online. I pretty much knew it was the one when we left, but we had a third shop lined up afterwards and I wanted to do my due diligence. But in the end, we called Lovely Bride to see if they were still open and drove back to the shop, tried the dress on a second time and it was definitely the one!! Also purchased a belt and adorable earrings that just made the look come together. Can't recommend this team enough, what a fun experience! :)

ubbly and she was ready to get to work. She listened to my ideas of what I wanted and had a great eye for picking dresses that matched my style. She didn’t try to push anything on me that I didn’t want to try on. We had tried another bridal shop previously and did not have a good experience, but Ayanna immediately gave us great vibes and helped me have fun and actually enjoy the process.The dresses themselves are beautiful and well made. There are many different styles and fits, but they are all high quality while still being reasonable priced. I would recommend this store for any bride looking for their perfect dress! :)

I had my very first bridal gown appointment at Lovely and was helped by Lizzie. It was the best experience I could have hoped for. I've never experienced anything like it, being a ...

bridesmaid a few times before. Each time before stylists rushed the bride, pressured them into a decision just trying to make a sale, and either were inattentive or crowded out others' voices with their loud voice and personal stories. But Lizzie was so fun in the best way! She kept everything upbeat, but was a very neutral presence throughout the process. She gave room for everyone to talk but from the beginning made sure it was known my opinion as the bride was what she would be listening to and using for guidance—no one else's voice would crowd out the bride. She was attentive and supportive but never ever pushy. I had so much fun trying on different kinds of gowns and it felt like dress up in the best way. She let me experience it my way and I never felt like there was some looming need to make a decision, which is all too common. Instead, when I tried on a dress (still having tons of fun wearing it) and knew it wasn't the one, she complimented my decisiveness. It is more difficult to say "no" to a gorgeous gown than I previously thought, but she made it very easy. Never pressuring me to say "yes" to a dress, but supporting my instincts for what I didn't like, saying that would help me know for sure when I found the dress I did want. I did not find my dress at Lovely, but I am so so glad I had my very first bridal appointment there. Trying on all those gowns really helped me know what I wanted and prepared me to spot the dress I liked later. Lizzie set me up with the right mentality for dress shopping which made the rest of the process until I did say "yes to the dress" completely stress-free and fun. And above all, she facilitated a beautiful time for my sisters, mom, and I to celebrate the coming wedding and the fun of dress shopping. I will never forget it. Thank you, Lizzie!

I have nothing but positive things to say about my experience at Lovely Bride. I visited a few different shops, but found that the selection at Lovely Bride fit my style best, and ...

I felt like they had more options than smaller boutiques while still having that intimate boutique feel. I also enjoyed that they have all their available styles listed on their website & that you are able to add whichever ones you are interested in trying on to your profile prior to your appointment. That way when you get there the stylist already knows what vibe you’re looking for and has already pulled the specific dresses that you know you want to try on. Lizzie was my stylist at all my appointments and I found she was quite helpful. It took me 3 appointments with her to finally say yes to a dress, and I never felt rushed or pressured, she gave good advice on how to eliminate dresses and narrow down what I wanted, and was great at pulling dresses based on various things I mentioned I liked/didn’t like. I would definitely recommend Lovely & Lizzie for your wedding dress shopping :)

I made an appointment at Lovely Bride SF under unique circumstances. I had bought at dress at the first boutique I went to 7 months ago. I was having second thoughts, and felt like...

I needed to go to Lovely Bride to try on some dresses I had been "stalking" since receiving the original dress I bought. With only 5 months until my wedding date, to say I was feeling stressed was an understatement. Lizzie was my stylist, and she was INCREDIBLE. I will forever remember her genuine kindness, humor, and real experience that made me feel comfortable and fully validated in my journey. She helped me parse through my feelings, and try on just the right amount of dresses to help me explore. She didn't make me feel guilty in the slightest when I realized that my original dress was still "the one." She made me feel like she was 100% there to support me, rather than just sell me a dress or other items. It's for this reason that I would recommend that everyone visit Lovely Bride on their journey for finding a dress, and for discovering what's really important--how you feel in your dress. Thank you, Lizzie!

ses. Lizzie, who helped us, was wonderful. She pulled items based on my feedback on what I had tried on. I didn't feel I was treated any differently for buying a sample, and she found me the most beautiful veil to coordinate as well. She managed my opinions as well as those of my mom and sister, and was friendly yet very efficient. She shipped me the dress to Texas and I didn't even have to pay sales tax! Highly recommend.

Lovely Bride has a fabulous collection of dresses you can't find elsewhere around SF; for me it was all about their Rime Arodaky collection. I arrived pretty discouraged having tr...

ied many dresses at many price points, but ultimately found my dress here and frankly it's the best dress ever, and working with Devon to find it was fantastic. She has a great eye and was extremely helpful throughout the process. I was shopping solo due to pandemic restrictions, struggling with wedding dress sticker shock and wedding-related decision fatigue, wasn't entirely confident in my own preferences for the dress, and feeling generally un-sentimental about the process; and Devon was a dream stylist - she really got me through it. In the end I was obsessed with my dress and LOVED wearing it for my wedding --- my love and enjoyment of it meant more to me than I expected. I am grateful that the dress that was truly perfect for me and my wedding was waiting for me at Lovely Bride and that Devon helped me find it (she KNEW) + had amazing styling tips!

rrible customer service - constantly being disrespected and laughed at over the phone Still waiting to hear back after being promised it would be resolved in April Lost $2500 on a dress purchase that I will never wear Long story: After waiting a month to get an appointment, I was so excited to finally get in and try on all my favorites from the countless insta stories of Lovely. They were one of the few to post about size inclusiveness and having several boho styles - I fell in love with! When I arrived - all the dresses on my wishlist either weren't available OR a size 4-6 sample. I totally understand that being a size 12 street size is really a size 18 bridal and its already so hard to find designers that will make your size. Don't advertise that you are size inclusive when there isn't more than 5 styles to try on that are bigger than a size 6! This should have been red flag number 1. When I did finally find a dress that I loved, which was already over my price range that I told them in the beginning of the apt. The consultant told me it would be ok because you would only need few alterations since the size fit off the sample -to expect only $300 in cost. So I said YES to the dress! After waiting until April for the dress to come in, I was so excited to come in and pick it up! We live an hour away from SF so its a fun drive to go pick up in the city. Unfortunately - you weren't able to try on your purchased dress in the store because of COVID restrictions. Which makes no sense, how could I try on all the samples I want but the dress that is only mine I can't. This should have been warning flag number 2 but no I kept the faith and trusted the staff. They said call within 48 hours if there is any issues. I went straight to the alterations where they told me I would need a lot of alterations to adjust the length and straps, a total of $800 in alterations. I was in shock! I just trusted the staff that alterations would be lower but I was in sticker shock now with the dress being over my budget but also including alterations is now $1K over my budget! I called the store immediately after I left the alterations to say they ordered my dress wrong and they literally laughed on the phone saying that wasn't possible. I asked to talk to a manager, they said they will call me back in an hour. Fast forward to the next day, I finally get a call offering to provide an alterations credit of $300 OR they can resell my dress on Halo for less commission than normal. I took the offer to sell my unused dress on Halo April 2021. They said great, we will draft the contract up and have it to you next week. After 5 emails and weekly calls, I have finally received the contract. I did my part and signed everything within 10 mins of receipt. I have not yet to receive next steps, no reply to my acceptance email, and the dress is not on the site for sale! I will never refer this company to anyone unless you are smaller than a size 6 street size, have a budget of $3000+ for your wedding dress + alterations, and don't care about how they treat customer service.

Devon did a great job listening to my wants and needs and even let me have a say in the music during the appointment to put my mind at ease and focus on how I felt in each dress. I also came in solo and Devon did a great job helping me document my selections and take pictures so that I could share the experience with loved ones that weren't able to be there in person. There was a lot of transparency around pricing and their website made it easy for me to know what would be available in store. I would definitely recommend Lovely Bride!

to try. Lovely had a large selection of dresses and the quality was amazing - every dress I tried I, I liked (made the decision hard!!). Diana made sure that I gave every style a try, walked me through the options and gave great recommendations when I asked. Because of Covid, my mom couldn't make it in person so we dialed her in via FaceTime - Diana took the phone, showed her all of the angles and walked her through the details as if she was there live. I had a really tough time making a final decision - Diana and the whole team at Lovely was patient and thoughtful as I worked through my options. It was a truly an amazing experience - would highly recommend.

I also went to BoLee and Trudy's last week - which both have great reviews - and there was no comparison. For one - LovelyBride hands down had the best options in terms of a beautifully curated collection. There was the perfect amount of options to choose from. Devon provided unparalleled attention. It was the only boutique that let me walk around and pick dresses. I also received the most attention to detail here - getting outfitted with a myriad of accessories to help me decide: veil, cape, wings, belt, a fake bouquet of flowers! It made the experience so fun and really helped complete a final picture.

7 months away, and Jenny Yoo, for example says it's only a 3-4 months lead time for her made to order dresses on their website. I didn't get a clear answer when I asked my stylist when I would have had to order. I left feeling confused and a little like I was being lied to or there was some misunderstanding and I wasn't being listened to. Everyone seemed nice enough otherwise, and I do feel like my stylist was trying? I still probably wouldn't go back or recommend. It's too bad, because my virtual appointment with Tiffany, who is mostly based in Chicago, was awesome.

Not only did she help me narrow down exactly which styles looked best on my body, she took all my my comments and feedback to build on what I already liked.

s I went to try dresses on, and the one I went back to, to make a purchase. Darri. Is. A. Dream. She couldn't have made dress shopping for enjoyable.

If you are looking for a wedding dress plus size or not, go. There is something in everyone's price range.
