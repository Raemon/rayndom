Flares Bridal has provided the best experience in finding a wedding dress! Their expertise is obvious in how quickly they were able to pick out so many options that matched the gen...

eral description of what I was looking for. The customer service is impeccable - truly highlighting the intimate experience of a family owned business. I also love that they do in house alterations, knowing they would treat their dresses better than any outside source. Seeing familiar faces through each step of the process has made it both enjoyable and memorable. I could not recommend them enough!

Flares has been amazing throughout the dress process. Very professional, knowledgeable, and kind. Ayanna was the best consultant! Thank you, Flares Team!

I had a wonderful experience finding my wedding dress at Flares. The boutique itself is clean, bright, and filled with natural light, which makes the whole experience feel calm and...

special. They have a beautiful and thoughtfully curated selection, including several European designers, and you can really tell there's a strong appreciation for both design and quality. That mattered a lot to me given the price point, and I felt the pricing was reasonable compared to overall bridal dress budgets and the craftsmanship offered. The boutique is owned by two kind sisters who were warm and welcoming throughout the process. Since choosing my dress, I've been back to try on veils and for my first fitting, and everything so far has been smooth and positive. One small heads-up for future brides: make sure your try-on appointment is fully confirmed with a confirmation email. Their booking system isn't the most seamless--I experienced a test payment without the appointment actually being booked and only learned this upon arriving, which meant rebooking. Thankfully, things have gone well since then. Overall, a great experience with lovely people, beautiful gowns, and high-quality pieces. I'd definitely recommend Flares--just double-check that appointment confirmation.

While I was trying on dresses, other women were too and the environment was so kind and warm; everyone was telling each other how beautiful one another looked...It was a really special day that will be a core memory for me for the rest of my days Fast forward to my first alteration and I had the EXACT same, incredible experience. This time, Beatrix was there to work with me to make my dress perfect and she did just that. Every detail was thought of and cared for. Lissa her team are one of a kind and I would encourage anyone ready to get their dress to go to Flares.

My sister and I are both getting married in 2026 and went to one other shop before Flares. As soon as we walked in, I could tell the experience here was going to be better. Ayanna ...

was a delight from the very start! She listened to us both, asked the right kind of questions, and made the whole experience such a vibe. I ended up choosing a dress she picked as a wild card, just to try. She knew! I absolutely love it and cannot wait for my fiancé to see this beautiful dress Ayanna helped me find! They had a wide selection of dresses to choose from and a spread of pricing. Ayanna was great about listening to our budget and helping to think about alteration costs so we were trying options that were in our budget total. I am doing my alterations at Flares but my sister lives out of state so she has to find another shop in her town. I'm so glad we came into Flares and grateful for all Ayanna's help! I definitely recommend coming shopping here!

I had a fantastic experience at Flares Bridal; I went in January and worked with Wendy. I described what kind of dress I was looking for and she was able to find sample dresses tha...

t fit my description. She also did a great job of finding dresses that I initially was not interested in but ended being very flattering. The deciding factor that made me choose my dress was when Wendy grabbed extra lace and applied it to the thin shoulder straps changing it from spaghetti straps to thicker straps. It completely changed the look of my dress, and I fell in love with how it looked. They told me the dress would come in in early summer and it came in this past Wednesday, I was nervous I would no longer like it but as soon as I put it on, I fell in love again. They had their seamstress there, so I was able to start alterations. So far, I have had nothing but positive experiences with all of the staff. They are so knowledgeable and helpful when it comes to picking out your dress and making sure you are happy with the look. I am so glad I got my dress from here and can't wait until the alterations are done.

I cannot say enough good things about Flares Bridal. I came into this bridal boutique on a Sunday afternoon, without an appointment, very stressed about having a wedding less than ...

4 months away and the entire team: Lissa Anne, Ayanna and Bea, were so welcoming and patient. They managed to make the impossible quite possible, as Lissa was kind enough to give me an appointment right then and there, during her lunch time and to make matters even better, she was very supportive and immediately understood my needs and wants, and found me a beautiful dress, perfect for my body type and within my budget in record time. I tried 3 dresses on, and was in and out of the boutique in 45 minutes, happy and excited about my new wedding dress. Initially I was nervous, since I had been to another boutique where the environment was hostile, the staff was unpleasant and prices were over the top. Thankfully, Flares Bridal and Lissa have made this process enjoyable and painless, truly heaven sent. I hope you give them a chance and see for yourself, you won't regret it!

I can't say enough good things about my experience buying my wedding dress at Flares! I came to Flares in 2019 to find my dress and had the incredible pleasure of working with the ...

sales associate at the time -- I believe her name was Michelle. She made me feel so welcomed and special during my shopping experience. As a bride with a disability who uses a wheelchair, one of my biggest fears when shopping for my wedding dress was that the sales associates would be awkward and uncomfortable around me (which was definitely my experience at other bridal shops I went to first). Michelle and the other people working at Flares treated me like any other bride in terms of the shopping experience, but were more than happy to take that extra step in the service and support they provided when I needed it. Sometimes, as a person with a disability, I have to settle for the bare minimum when it comes to inclusion with customer service. This was not at all the case with Michelle at Flares! Not only did I genuinely feel like she was treating me the way she would treat any other bride, but I felt comfortable asking for any extra help I needed. At other bridal shops, they insisted that I have someone besides the sales associate helping me get into the dresses, but Michelle was a total champ and helped me by herself. I was one of the unlucky brides whose wedding was originally scheduled in 2020 -- Flares was so accommodating and worked with me to keep my dress safe until I could pick it up and then still cleaning and pressing it 3 years later when I was finally able to have my wedding! I genuinely hope I get to buy another dress here (for a vow renewal! Not a new marriage lol) just so I can have that experience all over again!

well. Second (service) I can't say much about other employees here because I'm mainly only worked with Lisa and one time her sister. Lisa is amazing! She helps you find the dress that you want and is within your budget, has a great personality that really brightens your day, and tries to accommodate you to the best of her ability. Third (getting the dress) Getting fitted for the dress, scheduling alterations, and picking up the dress were smooth and seamless. Something to keep in mind is that you can only pick up your dress and do alterations on the weekdays. Not as convenient, but the service has always been great here so that more than makes up for the inconvenience. Would recommend this for anyone that wants a smooth wedding dress buying experience!
