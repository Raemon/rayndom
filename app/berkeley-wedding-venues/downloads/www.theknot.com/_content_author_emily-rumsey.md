Emily Rumsey is an associate editor on the commerce content team. In this role, she helps maintain and optimize shoppable articles for TheKnot.com. 

Emily's interest in editorial was inspired by the fictional characters Jane Sloan, Andie Anderson and young Carrie Bradshaw. In college, she majored in Journalism and held two digital media internships. As a self-proclaimed shopaholic and hopeless romantic, she's excited to contribute to The Knot and inspire couples to celebrate their unique love stories. 

Emily currently lives in Denver, Colorado, where she likes to explore the city's food scene and hike when the weather is warm. In her free time, she volunteers for the nonprofit Camp Kesem.

## Experience

Emily is a digital media specialist with a background in editorial writing, content production and website development. Prior to joining The Knot Worldwide, she worked as a website editor and manager for The Paleo Diet® where she gained a keen eye for detail and reliable digital marketing skills. 

Emily received her first byline as an intern for the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, where she met and wrote about elite athletes Adrian Peterson and Mo Bamba. Her passion, however, is lifestyle content—including relationship, travel and food content. At The Paleo Diet, she focused on science-based "how-to" articles about nutrition and exercise.

## Education

Emily received her Bachelor of Arts degree in Journalism from the College of Media, Communication and Information at the University of Colorado Boulder. She also majored in International Affairs with a Chinese minor. 

In college, Emily was a member of the honor fraternity Phi Sigma Pi and an executive for the university's Camp Kesem chapter.  


## Important Questions from The Knot

### Best advice for to-be-weds?

Don't skimp on a wedding photographer or videographer and plan a shot list. This is a day you will always want to look back on, so make sure you find a vendor you trust to capture it in a style you love.

### What’s your all-time favorite wedding song?

Songs like the "Cha Cha Slide" and "Wobble"—when the song has a well-known line dance, there's no excuse not to join in!

### Dream celebrity wedding guest?

I would love a surprise performance from Dan + Shay; I think they have some of the most romantic country songs.

### Best wedding after party snack?

Mini corn dogs with shoestring fries and lots of different dipping sauces!
