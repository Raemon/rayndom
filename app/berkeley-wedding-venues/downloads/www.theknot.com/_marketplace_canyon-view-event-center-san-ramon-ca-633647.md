ig help and were lovely to work with! Communication was easy and they got back to us right away. We had a lot of changes to our planning but they were both very helpful with those changes. The night of our reception was beautiful. We had very minimal decorations brought in because we knew the venue was just enough. The staff was helpful and even knew my wedding party by first name. Everyone was so accommodating and friendly during the whole wedding process. All of my guests were happy about the site, food, and staff!

. Our guests couldn’t stop complimenting how beautiful and serene the setting was. A huge thank-you to Saneta and Jessica, who were incredibly responsive and truly wonderful to work with. Since we didn’t have a wedding planner, their guidance and support were invaluable. They answered every question, kept us on track, and made sure we felt confident throughout the entire planning process. We genuinely appreciated how attentive and supportive they were from start to finish. The venue itself is spacious, elegant, and thoughtfully designed — it allowed our vendors to work seamlessly and gave our guests plenty of room to enjoy every moment. Everything ran smoothly on the day-of, and we felt so cared for the entire time. Really appreciated Saneta checking in with me & my now husband to ensure we had everything we needed. Canyon View Event Center helped make our wedding unforgettable, and we would absolutely recommend this venue to any couple looking for a stunning location paired with an exceptional team.

They were professional and available to address any questions or concerns we had. Also, they made sure to keep in contact with us to ensure the outcome of our wedding was exactly what we envisioned. The food was delicious and they are willing to work with you on pricing to suit your needs. I would highly recommend this venue for special events!!

The manager Saneta was so personable making her extremely pleasant to work with. She provided timely, professional, and helpful advice, which made our DIY wedding planning flow so smoothly. She and her team did everything to make our wedding amazing! We chose the buffet option and brought our own 2 kinds drinks which the Canyon View staff served in a timely and professional manner. We also ended up bringing our own appetizers with a cultural flair, but the options Canyon View had also looked delicious! Highly recommend this Canyon View :)

cause it will always hold a special place for me. Its been 2 months since my wedding and my friends and family are still talking about how this place was so nice and how much fun they had. The biggest highlight of this place is the AMAZING SERVICE. Its very hard to put into words how much I appreciate the staff and especially Saneta. First off the view is amazing from inside and outside. The layout is very spacious and the bar is placed in the perfect spot where its easily accessible and doesn't get crowded. Very important because half of my family was there damn near the whole night. About the staff - I cant speak enough to how helpful and knowledgeable Saneta was. She's definitely a huge resource to lean on. She advised us on so many things that we never even thought of like how cups you should buy per person, or how much cake you should buy. Her list of vendors after our initial meeting was a huge! For ASIAN families - My family is used to the Chinese restaurant 7 course meal sit down thing. My wife and I wanted something more modern like a country club or winery...but first off they were way way way more expensive with half the accommodations...plus having outside catering wasn't an option so yeah...There's a Chinese restaurant very close to the venue that we used and that pretty much topped everything off for us. Having the right food was our parents biggest concern and with that handled I cant say enough how much I recommend this place to anyone that is trying to please their Asian parents while not sacrificing on your own wants. Lastly. The bring your own beverages option SAVED SO MUCH MONEY. I'm so glad we chose this place. Just so much I can say about this place that writing doesn't even feel like I'm giving this place the justice it deserves.

our large families. It is also amazingly beautiful to boot! We worked closely with Saneta and she has been sooo responsive and helpful. She answers all of our questions with such enthusiasm and helpfulness that it made the stressful wedding planning experience a lot less painful. During our wedding week I was worried about the change in rainy weather but she helped us develop contingency plans and worked with our vendors. She even stayed late one rainy night to help us! We had an amazing time and cannot recommend the venue and the staff enough. The venue even received a recent renovation and looks even MORE beautiful. We highly recommend Canyon View to anyone who wants a beautiful venue, amazing on-site staff, incredible flexibility, and a good time!

The Canyon View is such a beautiful place to have your wedding ceremony and reception. The coordinators are so helpful and kind. The location is awesome as well as there are hotels...

Unfortunately they do not work with wedding parties under 150 people.

Response from CANYON VIEW EVENT CENTER on 07/17/2017

Hello, Due to the size of the venue, we are not able to accommodate group sizes less than...

150 people. Our capacity is 450 people and we are not able to divide the ballroom. This is a similar policy as the food and beverage minimum that venues have. We do not have a food and beverage minimum but we do have a minimum guest count for the space. Some clients that are close to 150 guests do book the space for 150 people but have less attend. We apologize for any inconvenience that this may have caused you. Thank you, Saneta

ur guests were amazed by how beautiful the place was and how our wedding came out. Saneta, helped us from the start to end. She was very prompt and responsive with all our questions and concerns. I was surprised of how quick of the response in all times of the day. She made sure everything we wanted was taken care of for our day. Saneta was able to make sure certain amenities were achievable at our wedding. Thank you so much! Sometime after booking the venue we were able to have a tasting of the buffet entrée options, which I highly suggest because you can see what will work for you and your guests. Then you will have an idea of which menu item to choose from or even give details on how it is cooked if you wanted. The buffet was setup nicely for a large party where there could be two lines, which helped speed things up when calling each table for their turn. We choose the follow foods: Appetizers; Bruschetta and Crab Cakes. Salad: Green Salad Entrée: Salmon, Carved Beef, Vegetarian Pasta Sides: Rice Pilaf, Steamed Vegetables We got the additional lighting inside which illuminated the entire venue. It was definitely worth the cost as it set the elegant vibe. Also we upgraded the seats as that was an option that the wifee really wanted. One comment that stuck out in my mind was a 96 year old guest, she mentioned that out of all her weddings she been to throughout her life, that ours was the most beautiful. All of our crazy family and friends took advantage of the our selection of alcohol. I bet that saved us a ton getting them all from Costco. (We over bought alcohol now we have plenty to drink for the next year. Be aware you can't return alcohol... so bottoms up!) We took the option for 2 bartenders which was a great idea. We were so happy that we choose The Canyon View. The pictures the memories were perfect for us! \- Brian & Crystal

We just had our wedding in here early October. The venue is beautiful, without doubt, inside and outside. Everything is nice with a big parking lot. However, Sabrina at Canyon view...

did her best to ruin my mood on the wedding day. She is truly terrible! 1\. $15k does not even include a spoon, wine glass, cocktail glass. The chiavari chair is an upgrade. The red one is $4/each but the white or silver one is $12/each because they want everyone to rent the red one to match their new hardwood floor. I rather you say $17k and includes all the necessary utensils. 2\. The cake cutting was another fee. However, after we cut the cake. My groomsman have to ask Sabrina a few times before they take our cake to slice it. But they didn't pass it to each table, instead they just throw it in the back of the venue -_- 3\. On the contract, it says we have a coordinator on site. However, on the wedding day, Sabrina disappeared most of the time. When she appears, she was to give us troubles or just sitting there and play with her phone. 4\. Our florist told Sabrina that they left some new folded boxes in the bridal suite so that I can take the centerpieces flower home. Sabrina FAILED to let us know when we were packing. Until the next day, I told my florist that I feel so sad tossing all my flowers, she said that she told Sabrina about the boxes! If Sabrina doesn't like her job, why didn't she just tell the florist to talk to me? 5\. During the wedding, the bartender told Sabrina that we are almost run out of soda. My friend was there to witness it. Sabrina just said "I don't care, not my business." Okay...I know whatever we bring in, you won't touch it, but why not say it in a more polite way? 6\. We bring in some desserts and have to use their refrigerator. During the final meeting, they said it is okay to use. So on the wedding day, my bridesmaid wants to take the desserts in. Sabrina stop her and say she is prohibited to enter the kitchen, then my friend ask if she can put it in the refrigerator. Sabrina said no, she is not going to touch anything we bring from outside. Okay...so going circle? We can put it there but we can't go in...-_- 7\. During our final meeting, Sabrina said we can take the left over food home. Their minimum was 150 headcounts and we only have around 135 people. There's food left for sure and my guest said there were a lot left. When we were packing, no one ask if we would like to pack it to go. The food disappeared since 8:30pm... 8\. During our final meeting, we said that we want a tall bar table next to the fountain during ceremony. On the wedding day, they gave me a 6" long rectangular table, totally blocking the overview of the fountain...-_- 9\. We rented an arch, but our wedding was on Sunday so the rental company will charge us 3x to remove it on the same day. Canyon view did not allow us to leave it there overnight 10\. Before the ceremony, we put 1 bottle of red wine and 1 bottle of white wine on each reception tables. However, after the ceremony, it was replaced by 2 jars of water........ Overall this is a very beautiful venue. However the service was terrible! One of my guest said she really likes the place and was going to book for her wedding. I stopped her. I strongly recommend people DO NOT book this venue. People there hate their job and will do their best to ruin your big day.

Two weeks later our guests are still commenting on how good the food was, how beautiful the setting was and what a magical wedding it was.

Both my brothers had their wedding reception at the Canyon View and we worked with Saneta for both weddings. She was such a pleasure to work with and unlike a lot of other wedding ...

halls, Canyon View is super accommodating. We're Tibetans and have certain requirements for our wedding ceremonies, like bringing in our own sweets and home-made cookies to serve guests when they arrive. Saneta was so understanding and super respectful of all our needs. What more can one ask for for their wedding. The wedding planning and the weddings themselves was a huge success. Our guests complimented us on picking such a beautiful venue and was very impressed by the Canyon View staff. Even though we worked with Saneta for most of the planning, on the wedding day- we got to work with Sara and Sabrina, too, who were so friendly and sweet. Plus, we had a lovely waiting staff and bartenders (Carlos and his friend- you guys were amazing!), too. The warmth of the staff was very important since more than 50% of our guests were from out of town and we wanted the wedding to be a extension of their east bay experience. And in all honesty, for both the weddings, Canyon View staff was family! For those couples wanting to go all DIY with their decor: we had photo booths for both the wedding which were 100% DIY. For the first wedding, we did it at the end of the hall, next to the dressing room because it had good lighting- but that wasn't a very good idea. With all the busy-ness- socializing and being entertained, people forgot about the phot-booth (also because it was not visible enough). So on the second wedding we had it right at the entrance. We were initially skeptical of it, but it looked really nice. The bright colors of the photo-booth background really stood out in the natural light at the entrance. And I would totally recommend this spot to everyone. We used the piano at the entrance for our guest book signing. On one wedding, we used a time capsule as the guest book (it will be opened on their first anniversary). For the second wedding, we used old vinyl records as a guest book and decorated the space with a record player and a few other vintagy pieces. Both ended being great ideas and the guests really enjoyed writing in them. I would recommend Canyon View to anyone looking for a stress-free wedding. The location is beautiful, there's plenty of parking and the staff is super accommodating. I've been to dozens of weddings and have been part of planning a few other weddings for friends and family at other locations. So far this place has been the best! Thanks Saneta- you really are the bestest! And we're so happy to have gotten a chance to work with Sabrina and Sara, too (even though for a brief time, it was quite a memorable one!).

My wedding at Canyon View was beautiful! My guests really enjoyed the outdoor patio and the spacious room. The owner of the place was a nightmare to deal with. My cake was infested...

nts when it came down to finalizing details for our wedding but the staff was very helpful and we were able to do everything over the phone and through e-mails.

Sabera really cared that we and our families had a good time. We did not end up using her in-house catering so I can't review that (the tasting was not so good). Overall I would highly recommend this site to the organized bride or the laid-back bride who can handle reminding Sabera of a detail or two. She's worth it!
