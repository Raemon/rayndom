Specializing in wedding day management. Leigh & Co. Events is a team of wedding planners and day-of wedding coordinators that design and deliver expert execution for every couple in the San Diego, San Francisco, Tahoe, Sacramento, Orange County, Palm Springs and LA areas. Leigh & Co. came to life after Brianne, the owner, needed a wedding coordinator on her day. She loved planning on her own, but needed someone to take her plans and execute. Well… it seemed like an impossible task. Most planners wanted her to hire them as a full service planner, which is not what she needed. And, those that offered day-of coordination were so bare bones that she didn’t feel any support. Then launched Leigh & Co – a truly unique approach when it comes to day of coordination. Our processes we’ve created make every couple comfortable when it comes to execution on the day. Our extensive questionnaires, community calls, podcast episodes, brochures and more ensure you get what you need from us when it comes to planning.. and on the day – we execute! From the moment you book with us, we're by your side. Each of our packages include: an onboarding call with a specialist local to your area to suggest vendors and make any recommendations for you, a wedding planning guide to ensure you are comfortable with all the planning, exclusive access to our preferred vendor list specific to your location, access to our facebook group to connect with other newly engaged Leigh & Co couples, live calls and access to our team that provides step by step planning tips, detailed questionnaires that help make sure you have all the pieces ready for the day, timeline construction, a final details meeting with your lead planner and onsite coordination. With our personalized approach to every single couple and a more full-service approach, we work together to tell your story with personal touches that make for an unforgettable celebration. What sets us apart is our detailed questionnaires and timelines. Our understanding of your personalities, tastes and styles allows us to craft a thoughtfully designed wedding, catered to you that is full of classic, romantic details. So sit back, relax and enjoy the planning with us!

I’m solution-oriented, adaptable, and deeply committed to making the planning process feel smooth and joyful.

Laura Ginn

San Francisco Lead Coordinator

I’m based in San Mateo, and my love for weddings grew from being around the décor, production, and energy that make celebrations come to life. I started my career as a wedding banquet server and worked my way up to Director of Weddings and Events, later gaining experience as both an assistant and lead planner with various planning teams. I bring a lighthearted, fun approach while always staying a step ahead—overcommunication and preparedness are key to my planning style. My favorite moment of the day is the start of the reception, when the nerves fade, the energy shifts, and everyone is ready to celebrate. When I’m not planning weddings, I stay busy with long walks with my puppy, thrifting, beach day trips, and spending time with friends and my twin sister.

San Diego Lead Coordinator

’m based in San Diego, California, and my love for weddings first sparked after watching 27 Dresses and becoming fascinated by all the moving parts that go into creating such a meaningful celebration. Since then, I’ve grown to truly love seeing each couple’s personality and love story come to life through thoughtful planning and design. I’ve been coordinating and planning weddings since 2018, working with venues across Colorado and San Diego, from full DIY backyard weddings to all-inclusive venues. My style blends boho chic with modern minimalism, and my favorite moment is the recessional—when all the nerves melt away and the couple steps into pure joy and celebration together.

My style is timeless with a touch of natural elegance, focusing on meaningful details that feel effortless, personal, and true to each couple’s story. My favorite moment is right before the ceremony begins, when everything is in place and the couple can take a deep breath before stepping into one of the most meaningful moments of their lives.

We hired Michelle Knutson for our November 2025 Palm Springs wedding and truly could not be happier with our experience. We had a fairly small event, so we went with the day-of-coo...

rdinator package. Michelle truly went above and beyond just the day-of coordinating. She coordinated a couple intros zooms, got in touch with our venue and all of our vendors beforehand and brought us solutions when we realized we were going to be rained on. The day of she was a straight shooter - direct and ran a tight ship. But she was also warm, friendly and upbeat. Her assistant even took care of my dog for me and made sure he was fed and walked! We are forever grateful to her and her team for making our day so special. 10/10 recommend!

Leigh and Co. came to my husband’s and my rescue within weeks of our special day. We thought we could plan and execute everything on our own (ha!), but were lost putting all the pi...

eces together regarding vendor communication and wedding timeline. We finally reached out to Leigh and Co less than a month before our wedding, and were so grateful to have been assigned our coordinator immediately. Despite being on vacation one of the few weeks prior to our wedding, she worked to set up meetings with our vendors and helped coordinate a seamless day that we will never forget. Thank you Leigh and Co for your help and guidance on this very special day.

We had the pleasure of working with Leigh & Co Events for our May 2025 wedding, and we truly cannot recommend them enough. From start to finish, our coordinator was calm, organized...

, and attentive — exactly the kind of person you want managing such an important day. She put so much care into making sure everything ran smoothly behind the scenes, which allowed us to be fully present and enjoy every moment without stress. It’s clear they genuinely care about their clients and takes great pride in their work. Thanks to our planner, our wedding day felt effortless and truly special — we are beyond grateful. If you're looking for a day-of coordinator who is thoughtful, efficient, and a joy to work with, book with them.

We booked Leigh & Co for our day-of coordination. Our planner got involved in our planning process a few months ahead of time, helping to coordinate with our vendors and ensure tha...

t we had everything in place ahead of time. Having never planned a wedding, it brought me so much peace to know that I had her in my corner helping me make some final decisions and ensure that my vendors had everything they needed from me. On the day of the wedding, she had everything handled -- our day was absolutely PERFECT, I was able to completely turn my brain off and just enjoy my day, while I knew I could trust that she had things handled. She somehow read my mind and anticipated everything I would want throughout the day, from a vodka soda while my mom bustled my dress before cocktail hour to having my sunglasses for me to put on during cocktail hour. I'm so glad we booked Leigh and Co., having her there on the day of my wedding brought me so much peace and allowed me to check out from worrying about how the logistics were going and just enjoy the best day of my life.

Our coordinator at Leigh & Co was absolutely wonderful. I didn't know what to expect going into it as I had little experience with event planning but she helped put me at ease. She...

made herself available to all my questions and concerns and I really felt as though she was a trusted advisor. Aside from being super knowledgable and made great recommendations, she was down to earth, relatable, and just generally easy to talk to and be around. I highly recommend Leigh & Co as they have more affordable wedding planning options while still taking a lot of the work off your plate!

portant it was to pass things off to someone I could trust so I could be present on the big day. Our assigned day of coordinator kept everyone on task while being kind and calm the entire time.
