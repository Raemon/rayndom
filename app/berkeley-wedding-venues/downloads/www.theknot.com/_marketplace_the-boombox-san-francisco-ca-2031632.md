It always feels risky making a big purchase with limited information, but after watching Boombox’s 90-second teaser video, we knew they were the band for us — and they absolutely d...

elivered! They brought the energy, the talent, and the tunes, and our guests were tearing up the dance floor for hours. The whole experience working with Boombox and the Jay Siegan Presents team was fantastic. They helped us navigate a tricky venue setup (where no stage fit!), learned Pink Pony Club, and made everything seamless. Their guitarist performed our ceremony music beautifully — even learning Canon in D for my walk down the aisle — and their trio played an amazing acoustic cocktail-hour set. It was so nice to find a band that could do it all while keeping the energy high all night long. We couldn’t recommend them more!

As a Corporate Event planner, we often work with various types of entertainment including bands and I want to touch here on the excellent experience my company had working with The...

Boombox! Working with bands should be fun and effortless. All major items should be outlined in the initial contract and communication should remain open and consistent in the months prior to the wedding or event. Clear terms, flexibility and open communication make it a win-win for all! This band was an absolute breeze to work with… They accommodated some last minute set timing requests, and were able to MC transitions at our event with calm poise and clarity. The musicianship though, was really the thing that stood out- Many bands that play these events have “canned” music tracks that play in the background to fill out a thin sound, but this band was completely organically playing, and even would break down songs and have call and response parts with the audience making everyone feel more included. The client also appreciated the diversity within the band, and just the warm and professional demeanor! Will be definitely using this group for more events!

From our first interaction to the last dance, Teal Collins, Jay Siegan Presents and The Boombox band made the entire process seamless. Their experience was recognizable from the st...

art as they guided us through the process, answered all of our questions, gave recommendations that made the party unforgettable, AND learned some requests that were special to our family. The band arrived early to set up, the stage was organized and the lights added great ambiance. We requested music for one hour before the cocktail reception as we welcomed guests and took photos. For the party, we chose from their list of songs, and the band filled in the rest. Teal is a great MC, directing the flow of the party and he really knows how to read the crowd. Teal and her band are extremely talented musicians, we still have friends and family asking about them. We cannot thank Boombox enough, we would recommend The Best Wedding Band to everyone and our day would not have been the same without them! Can’t wait to get them for our 1st anniversary!

Boombox was a super blast. All of the band were just so fun. They kept the energy super high the whole time. We specifically asked for no slow songs, and nothing too typical. So th...

The Boombox was 100% extra fun from beginning to end. Huge horn section, and blasted through all of our requests. Teal is an amazing singer, the band's team couldn't be nicer, and ...

everyone had huge smiles on their faces. Also a big thank you to them for working with our tough noise concerns at our venue. They really had the volume dialed, but still kept this party so lively. They truly made our day magical and supported or vision with care. 10/10!

ing! We knew we had quite a few song requests, and they already knew most of those, and they happily learned our favorite tune for our 1st dance. They were able to provide guitar and ukulele during the ceremony, a trio during our cocktail hour, a full dance band w/horns AND the singer Emceed all of the wedding transitions, so we didn't have to hire separate musicians or emcees, it was all included. The musicianship in this band is amazing- all of our guests were like "where did you find this band?!" The repertoire was great too, because the classics were there for the older folks in our party- like Ain't No Mountain and Signed Sealed Delivered, At Last- but also plenty of current hits like stuff by Lizzo, DNCE, P!nk, Harry Styles..... It just felt like a personal concert for our family and friends! A great experience.... by the way, you can do with horns or without, we LOVED the horns! Wouldn't have changed a thing- The Boombox rocks!! - Elizabeth
