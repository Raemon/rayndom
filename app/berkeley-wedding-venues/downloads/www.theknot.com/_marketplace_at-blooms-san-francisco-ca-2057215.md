Am filled with so much appreciation and gratitude for Saudat at Blooms. I knew I found the perfect florist months before the wedding day, during our first phone call when he perfec...

tly articulated the vision I had with the greenery and natural scenery. My appreciation only grew when he compiled the mood boards (which were super professional!) and set aside time to show me the table set-up over zoom. During the planning process his professionalism and attention to detail did not go unnoticed and really exceeded our expectations. On the day of the wedding, the florals and décor were so much more amazing than I could have ever imagined. I can still smell the greenery from the day!! Everyone was complimenting how lovely everything looked. Thank you for making our day so magical and stunning!
