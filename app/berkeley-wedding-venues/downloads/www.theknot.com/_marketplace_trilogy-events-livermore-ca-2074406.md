Haylie Barnes

Owner | Senior Event Planner

Haylie’s love for events began with her first high school Hello Dance, which she planned at the beginning of her senior year. Everything was so exciting from choosing themes and color palettes to planning attendee experience and flow. She describes it as a “talk to me, Harry Winston, tell me all about it” moment for her. Soon after completing her degree in Hospitality, Tourism and Recreation Management she moved to Miami, Florida where she began coordinating events for Kimpton Hotels & Restaurants. Haylie decided to relocate back to her home state of California where she continued her passion for event planning with a local Golf and Country Club, where she met Monica. Haylie says, “A chemistry like ours happens once in a lifetime, and we could not waste the opportunity we were given…I never believed in twin telepathy until I met her.”

Monica Overton

Owner | Senior Event Planner

Monica has been in the Events and Hospitality industry for over 15 years. Her passion for all things events began as a young girl when she would help her Grandma prep for holiday celebrations with the family. She taught Monica how to properly set a table and ALWAYS had everything planned down to the finest details. Later, she watched J. Lo in the Wedding Planner and knew that she wanted to put on events like those one day. Fast forward a little and Monica went off to school at San Jose State University where she received her degree in Hospitality, Tourism & Recreation Management with an emphesis on Event Management. Since then, she's worked in Private Club's (both city clubs and country clubs), with independent wedding and event planners and wineries before launching Trilogy Events in 2022. Celebrating all of life's milestones both big and small and creating memorable experiences for her clients and their friends and families is her passion!

We truly cannot say enough amazing things about Monica and Haylie from Trilogy Events. From the very first conversation to the final moments of our wedding night, they were nothing...

short of exceptional. Monica and Haylie are the perfect combination of organized, creative, calm, and genuinely kind. They anticipated every need before we even knew to ask, handled every detail flawlessly, and made the entire planning process feel effortless and enjoyable. Their professionalism and experience gave us complete peace of mind, and their warmth made us feel like we were planning with trusted friends. On the wedding day itself, everything ran seamlessly—if anything went wrong, we never knew about it. We were able to be fully present, soak in every moment, and truly enjoy our day because Monica and Haylie had everything under control. Our vision came to life even better than we imagined, and so many of our guests commented on how smooth and beautiful everything was. If you are considering Trilogy Events, do not hesitate. Monica and Haylie are absolute rockstars, and hiring them was hands down one of the best decisions we made for our wedding. We are endlessly grateful for them and would recommend them a thousand times over!

e actual day stress-free and smooth, they are meticulous and detail-oriented, thinking of everything you may need for your special day, and that’s coming from someone who is hyper type A. They handled the logistics of speaking to vendors and reviewing contracts, which allowed us to have more time to consider design aspects, which they were also so helpful for. I leave my wedding experience wanting to plan another one (which I don’t think many people can say), if I can do it again with Haylie and Monica. We had the best wedding weekend and we owe it to our fantastic wedding planners.

We were consistently kept in the loop with any changes or updates and they made sure our voices were heard at every turn. Truly, we cannot recommend this team enough. We are SO grateful for them for helping us to plan and execute the wedding of our absolute dreams. Special mention to Monica who was onsite with us for the wedding weekend and made sure we were keeping to our timeline but enjoying ourselves and staying present throughout the day - and for keeping a drink in our hands on the dance floor all night! She is an absolute rockstar. THANK YOU, TRILOGY! 🤍

Thank you for everything, Monica and Haylie! I hope to work with you again soon (and hopefully the feeling is still mutual after my innumerable meltdowns, lol!) You’re true gems!

Monica & Haylie just a few months before my own wedding at my best friend's wedding. My best friend hired them to coordinate her wedding, and I was impressed by their professionalism, friendliness, and smooth execution of all wedding events. I decided to hire them for my own wedding with the month of wedding package, and I can't say enough how much they helped me. I was a calm, happy bride because of them. I had taken on so much of the wedding planning for 9 months, and I was able to sit back and relax in the last month leading up to my wedding while they finalized details with vendors, worked with my venue through logistics, worked on my name cards for seating arrangements, created a seamless wedding day timeline, and brought my vision to life. Monica and Haylie are both amazing, organized, and professional experts in the field. I would recommend them to everyone and anyone planning a wedding. If you're on the fence wondering if you even need a wedding coordinator, I'd say DO IT with all my confidence and reassurance. My wedding planning processing and day went SO smoothly, thanks to them, and I was able to be present, calm, and joyful because they had it under control. If I could give them more than 5 stars, I would!

r management and communication and had a meeting with us to go over every detail that I hadn't even though of (as a self-described detail-oriented person). Because our wedding was so small, we decided to forego a lot of traditions and Monica and Haylie went with the flow and got our vibe pretty quickly. While they are detail-oriented, they are not uptight or sticklers. When the wedding day came, they managed all day-of arrivals, questions, timelines and were very friendly. They did a lot of behind-the-scenes work, which allowed me to be completely oblivious and relaxed on the day. I highly recommend Trilogy Events!

hrough the time they took over with the planning, to the actual “day of” they were extremely professional, yet also so warm and easy to talk to. On the actual “day of” they checked in on me at my hotel while they were on the way to the venue to ensure I was okay and didn’t need anything. Once at the venue they got straight to work on ensuring everything was set up properly and even used some of their own expertise to set up areas where I hadn’t given much guidance. They were like mind reader the entire day and just “knew” what was needed (like a glass of champagne or a bite to eat) at all the right times. They also made sure to keep the evening on schedule, but we’re also very flexible if I wanted to push anything back. At the end of the night they packed up everything perfectly and expertly loaded in my car. The entire day was seamless and I have these two ladies to thank for that! My (now) husband, MIL, mother, and many others told me how wonderful they thought Monica and Haylie were as well, and how smart I was to hire them.

Thank you so much, Maggie! Ensuring that our couples and their families and friends are ab...

le to be fully present on their big day is one of our primary goals so we are thrilled to hear that you were able to do just that. Details run through our veins, but we always appreciate when one of our Bride's is just as detailed and packs/labels her décor as meticulously as you did -- it certainly makes for a smooth set-up on the day, so thank YOU for that too! We are so happy for you and Steven and wish you both a lifetime of love and happiness together.

***The best team ever*** I am so happy and grateful that I had Haylie and Monica as my event coordinators. They were incredibly easy to talk to and were very responsive. They provi...

ded me with a timeline/checklist based on our discussions and included items I didn’t even consider at the beginning. They also coordinated all of my vendors in great detail. What really stood out is that they really put me first. If I asked to be included in any of the vendor communication, they always kept me in the loop. If anything deviated on the wedding day(e.g., table set up, changes to ceremony design, last minute parental requests, etc.), they always did a quick check to be sure I was okay with it. Having Trilogy there on my wedding day made a world of difference. Monica and Haylie not only kept my wedding day on track, but also constantly checked in on me. They started the morning off by creating a group text message followed by checking in and delivering lunch to the wedding party. They set up all of my personal design pieces (escort cards, card box, reserved seating signs, guest book, pens, cake cutting set, champagne glasses, etc.) and also packed up everything for me at the end of the night. If I needed any help, I would turn around and Haylie or Monica would be there to assist. When my friend’s ride failed to show, they even gave them a ride to the after party! Hiring Trilogy Events was one of the best decisions I made. I was able to relax and truly have fun on my wedding day. They helped to make a special day so memorable. I cannot say enough good things and will for sure be reaching out to them for future events as well.
