My wife and I got married at Saratoga Springs and I cannot recommend this venue enough. Working with the company, setup, take down, and everything in between was easy and simple. T...

hey communicated clearly and responded to all questions and requests promptly. We even had a major emergency on our wedding day and they went out of their way to work with us on adjusting the timeline and suggesting ways to resolve our problem. The location itself is absolutely gorgeous, we got married at Cathedral Grove and having everything next to the creek in the forest was magical. All our guests were raving about the location saying it was one, if not the, most beautiful wedding they've ever been to. We did catering thru them and the food was excellent, buffet style made it easy for guests to get what they want and get any seconds they so desired. That combined with the self served beer and wine made it easy for our guests to get as much food and drinks they desired. All staff we meet and worked with were all professional and friendly. The wedding planner you get day off was great, she was incredibly friendly and assisted us so much due to unforeseen emergencies that happened the morning of our special day. She helped make the already stressful day even easier. Just a note regarding this location, due to local regulations they are limited on music and drink options (limited live music and no hard liquor). But the venue company has a great list of options that are allowed. Also the companies they do work with are all wonderful, experienced, and were easy to work with. I would 100% recommend this place for your wedding, personal event, or corporate party. Besides its stunning location and looks the process to host an amazing event is easy and stress free with them.

ent above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed and more. ✨ Dayana (Day-of Coordinator): She worked tirelessly all day, so much so that I—the bride—asked her to take a break. She just laughed and said no, because she was determined to make sure every detail was perfect. ✨ Calista, Leslie & Jaycey: Warm, attentive, and always there before I even realized I needed something. Their behind-the-scenes effort truly made the day run so smoothly. ✨ Dominic: He made sure things flowed seamlessly and was such a calm, steady presence throughout the day. ✨ Olivia (Wedding Planner): I had the privilege of working with Olivia for over a year, and she was my rock. She gave me advice, guided me, kept me on track, and eliminated stress before it even had the chance to build. Practical, reassuring, and so knowledgeable—she made wedding planning feel easy. ✨ DJ Linh: If you’re planning a wedding, book him now. He had multiple meetings with us, reassured us every step of the way, and then absolutely killed it on the big day. The music, the vibe, and the energy were everything we hoped for and more. This group truly became our dream team. They worked together seamlessly to make sure we could just enjoy every moment, and we are forever grateful for them.

While Saratoga Springs is a beautiful venue, the staff does not live up to the standard that should come with it. When we booked, Jennifer assured us that the venue “comes with a d...

ay-of wedding planner, saving you $2–3k.” This turned out to be misleading. They are not true planners but venue coordinators you meet with only twice. They do not update invoices, track changes, or respond accurately to emails. For example, when our guest count changed significantly, I requested an updated invoice. Instead of providing one, they sent me numbers and told me to figure it out myself—something I could not do accurately. At the tasting, we had a terrible experience with a vendor, and the response from staff was simply, “Oh well, they aren’t with us.” Regardless, that vendor was representing the venue. Communication was consistently poor. Initially, we were told the venue was a “canvas” and that changes could be made, but at our second meeting, the assistant contradicted those approvals. Invoices remained inaccurate—off by as much as $15,000—even after I repeated corrections multiple times via email. During one meeting, the assistant became overwhelmed and asked if she should bring in the planner—Olivia—who was supposedly there all along. Why wasn’t she present when our appointment was scheduled with her? When Olivia finally came in, her behavior was unprofessional and disrespectful. She was defensive, dismissive, and even rude to my parents, who were paying a $40,000 bill. Instead of addressing concerns, she brought up irrelevant points, complained about her workload, and admitted, “We aren’t even there the day-of.” This was shocking since we had been told otherwise. Only then did we learn that the venue provides a “day-of coordinator,” not an actual planner. That distinction would have been helpful to know more than a month before the wedding. When I emailed to explain how inappropriate Olivia’s conduct was, the only response I received was, “We are a family-owned business,” which felt like a dismissive excuse rather than accountability. Unfortunately, the wedding day itself was no better. Calista argued repeatedly with our photographer in front of us, rushed my family, and changed the cake cutting to before dancing—so most guests missed it. She failed to cue us to go into hiding on time, so a quarter of my guests saw me before the ceremony. She ignored my request to gather the wedding party, leaving me alone in hiding. Later, she couldn’t manage the introductions before dinner, leaving the DJ to step in while she stood by confused and disengaged. Her only urgency was when she was arguing with our photographer—again, in front of us. To make matters worse, the DJ (who we were required to book through the venue) couldn’t remember my husband’s name, something all of our guests noticed. Between Olivia and Calista, our wedding experience was chaotic, stressful, and deeply disappointing. Their lack of professionalism, poor communication, and dismissive attitudes ruined what should have been one of the happiest days of our lives. I would not recommend having a wedding at Saratoga Springs if you want your day to run smoothly. If you really love the venue, get your own wedding planner, their staff doesn't care enough about your wedding to be a planner for it. They are venue coordinators with the title of day of wedding planner to get people to more likely book. Once they have your deposit they really fall off. DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS VENUE BECAUSE OF THEIR STAFF.

y easy to work with! The property itself is absolutely magical ! This is a multi venue location so there were other weddings going on but they were spaced far out enough that we didn’t even notice. It is also a beer and wine venue only but that didn’t matter for us. We were able to choose between a variety of beers and wines. They also have soju cocktails and things but we were more than satisfied with what we got. We got married in cathedral grove and it was the best day of my life!!! That location has a creek running though it and an absolutely magical back drop behind the outdoor kitchen. It is incredibly breathtaking and I could go on gushing about it forever! 12/10

We're so so happy that we chose Saratoga Springs as our wedding venue. It gave us the magical outdoor California setting that we dreamed of at a price that actually fit our budget....

So many of the other outdoor venues in the Bay Area had astronomical costs. In addition to the gorgeous setting, one thing that we initially loved was that gratuity wasn't automatically applied to all costs at a high rate (most venues we toured applied 22% on every portion of your bill, insane!). SS applied a smaller gratuity only on things like food and event staff time/effort, which felt much more reasonable. Planning the wedding was so much easier using such a polished venue. They have all the major things that you need (food, equipment rentals, DJ) all included as part of the package, so we never felt overburdened with planning these aspects of the wedding. And the coordinators, Sam and Olivia, were awesome at guiding us through the process and answering all our questions in a timely manner. The open house style event that they ran in early April was also super helpful for us to choose our food and beverages. We were initially concerned that no hard liquor based cocktails would be available, but the soju/sake substitutions were a hit with our guests (we got the margarita and mai tai). We used SS as the food caterer for the event and were not disappointed. having everything grilled right on site led to some delicious beef, chicke, and veggies that we and our guests loved. The wine provided (2 white, 2 red) were quite good, as was the house beer (a lager; we also added on a keg to give guests an option). The appetizers and dessert tables were also so so good! All our guests loved them. We were able to accommodate guests with a variety of dietary restrictions (celiac, vegan, kosher) without issue. The week of the event, we faced a challenge with an uncertain rain forecast. Olivia helped us make a decision on whether to rent a tent or not (we didn't) that ended up being the right call. We had some light drizzle but it was manageable with umbrellas that we provided guests. The day of the event went so smoothly. There were literally no issues for the whole day. Everything from setup to cleanup went perfectly. It was so nice to not have to worry about anything except enjoying our wedding day. I think that's one of the big benefits with SS - they're wedding experts and have so much experience that everything on the day of will run smoothly. In the end, our wedding was planned with minimal hassle and we had an amazing day that we'll always remember at a cost that we were content with. Highly recommend SS for weddings.

Saratoga Springs is a stunning venue with so much to offer. Back in 2022, I spent 6 months looking for a venue that was not only beautiful but also affordable and Saratoga Springs ...

hit all of our boxes. From the stunning forest setting to the beautiful fairy lights to the option to have your ceremony at 3 different venues depending on the size of your wedding, it was absolutely magical. We got married in Cathedral Grove which was everything I dreamed of for a forest wedding. The trees above the venue bend to look like a cathedral and the sun peaking through the trees was dreamy. We got married on a freak heat wave and it was so nice in the shade of the trees. They take care of everything related to food, drink, and set up along with offering incredible vendors which was such a blessing to have so many options. Yes, you do have to pay more for certain things such as set up and take down of whatever you bring to the venue but it was extremely helpful day of to not make our families have to worry about it and it wasn't expensive at all. The food was also incredible! We really appreciate Saratoga Springs and their teams for all they offer!

I cannot express how amazing this place is! So many of our guests couldn't stop talking to us about how nice the staff was and the venue was like a magical forest. It was beautiful...

during the day but at night it was breathtaking! The food was magnificent, and I wish I could pack it all up and take the leftovers home with us, it was better than most restaurants I've been to. Staff as I said earlier was so friendly, happy, and just plain fabulous. Our wedding was held in the Cathedral and even though it was over 90 degrees the day of our wedding, all of our guests expressed how nice the temperature was at the venue with all of the trees protecting us from the sun. The price is unbeatable with everything you get here! My husband and I both know that if we are ever going to be hosting another large event of some kind in the bay area we would totally come back to Saratoga Springs! If you are looking for a place in the Redwoods, look no further, come to this magical destination!

We had our wedding at Saratoga Springs - Cathedral Grove and we absolutely loved it. The venue has a creek that runs along the entire space and is surrounded by redwoods. The food ...

is delicious and is cooked fresh on site in large outdoor BBQ pits. The staff are helpful and kind. The coordinators were quick to respond throughout the planning process and gave great advice. They worked with us to get the space planned out just how we wanted and were essential in orchestrating the entire evening to flow smoothly. A special thanks to Olivia, Samantha and Jennifer. They went above and beyond to make dreams a reality. Saratoga Springs has a lot to offer in the way of customizable options (my favorite being the S’mores fire pit). All the recommended vendors we used through them were fantastic – there is a reason they require you to use some of their pre-approved vendors. This place will always have a special place in our memories <3

wedding coordinators at Saratoga Springs were incredible. We mainly worked with Sam, who was so attentive, responsive, reassuring, and an all around great person to work with. She spent a lot of time coordinating details with us and was our cheerleader throughout the process. The other day-of coordinator we worked with, Diana, was also a star! Thanks for keeping us sane.

everything I dreamt and more. I loved every detail- the string lights, the smooth process with the buffet line, the bonfine, and the just overall natural beauty of the venue. I give them 10 out of 10! I would highly recommend Saratoga Springs to anyone planning a wedding or special event.

We are SO glad we chose Saratoga Springs! It really is lovely. It is a relatively affordable choice for the area (cost is more dependent on number of guests), and it needs little d...

ecor because it's already so beautiful. The guests all loved it, and several of our friends are potentially considering it for a wedding venue now. It is a down-to-earth yet comfortable venue, and the staff (Jennifer, Sam, Olivia, and more) are also great to work with. Our wedding reception was fun-centric, and Saratoga Springs was the perfect choice. We also appreciated that pricing was so transparent from the beginning. We did a full buyout for 325 guests for an Indian wedding reception, which was expensive but ultimately the right move because we ended up using both Longbridge and Cathedral Grove areas. In theory, the Longbridge area seats up to 500, and without a buyout, another event with up to 180 guests could have been booked in Cathedral Grove. However, even with our single event for 325 guests, people were significantly delayed just trying to get into the lot. While Saratoga Springs is generally good at parking management (i.e. at their wedding showcases), it would have been much worse had there been another event happening. This was the only aspect of the event that, in our opinion, did not feel exactly as advertised by SS. If you are booking LB for 300+ guests, you may want to seriously consider a buyout so that CG can't be booked and you can use all of the space. Or you could arrange for a third-party shuttle from Cupertino or Saratoga to drop guests off. The fact that SS takes care of most of the important rentals directly (chairs, china, various entertainment) is a HUGE logistical plus. Take advantage of the lounge seating add-ons if you have elderly/other guests who may appreciate this later in the evening. The picnic tables also allow 1-2 chairs at the heads for those needing back support. The venue is beautiful, so you don't need much additional decor. Bud vases make great table decor that guests can take home as additional favors. The complimentary bonfire is awesome and the s'mores package is a fun add-on. It's also totally reasonable given the space to bring in vendors such as a photo booth van (we used Bay Area Photo Bus, from the SS required list) or an ice cream cart! Make sure to book the DJ and photo booth early because there is a required list. Bottom line: book them! Then book vendors who work there often! Other recommendations: \- Take all the free stuff! E.g. bonfire, wooden arch (your florist can work with it). \- You can have a champagne welcome drink rather than a champagne toast, which is a time killer. \- The photo booth and lawn games were excellent entertainment, and relatively affordable. The personalized GOBO at LB (projection onto the bridge) was okay -- it's not visible until it's pretty dark, and there are some trees that mostly block the view, but it's still a fun touch if you're willing to pay for it! \- If you're not doing a rehearsal dinner, you should still do a walk through the week of. Also scout out desired photo spots and scope out the lighting (ideally see how it is between 3-5pm) for your photographer. Having a plan helps you make the most of the allotted photo time. \- Try to work with vendors who are familiar with the venue. There are many options. It will make your life much easier. \- You don't need a planner. The SS coordinators and day-of staff are very good and pleasant to work with -- just write down as much information as possible for them about the flow of events in advance. Indian wedding specifics: \- We welcomed guests at Cathedral Grove and started a combined baraat (walking/dancing) from there through the open area into Longbridge; the full buyout made this possible, and Cathedral Grove remained open throughout the evening to guests needing a quiet area (this should be included with a full buyout: the lights stay on and the soft drink machines are available). \- We didn't do a ceremony, but we did use a similar seating setup facing the LB bocce courts for dance performances. The chairs were removed after the performances (before dinner) so the same space later became the dance floor. \- Book the DJ early because there is not much choice on the required list! We've recommended that Saratoga Springs expand their list to include more Desi DJs, but we were very happy with Wicked Entertainment. \- We had Koolfi Creamery set up an ice cream cart, and it was maybe the most popular part of the event. \- We had outside catering from Jalsa. The food was great, and it helps that they are familiar with the venue. They didn't have to bother us about anything day of. \- Though our florist wasn't Indian (we used Marbled Mint), we had a combination of traditional marigold and pink/orange assorted florals that we were very happy with. We had: arch decor, bud vases, and a few larger table arrangements. \- We didn't do a ceremony here, but the morning rental time slot is apparently popular for Indian wedding ceremonies.

e. From the start, their transparent and up-front pricing made a great first impression, and every interaction we had with them reinforced that positive experience. Jennifer warmly welcomed us, showing us the venue and patiently answering all our questions before we even committed. Olivia and Sam, the venue wedding planners, were incredibly accommodating throughout the entire planning process, making everything from choosing place settings to finalizing the reception floor plan a breeze. Their annual wedding showcase was invaluable, giving us the chance to swap out options for ones we were even more excited about. The venue's flexibility with DIY elements was a huge plus, allowing us to bring our own speaker for the outdoor ceremony, arch decorations, dessert, and centerpieces. We also used the Creekside Room's speakers to DJ our own small reception, which helped us stay on budget without compromising on the experience. Cammie, our day-of coordinator, was discreet and efficient, ensuring everything went flawlessly. My bridesmaids and I enjoyed getting ready in the bright cottage before the ceremony, which was held in a beautiful outdoor space. The food was delicious, with favorites including the salmon, Mediterranean salad, and saké margarita. Saratoga Springs was perfect for our intimate and budget-conscious wedding, and I believe it would be equally fitting for a large, more extravagant event. We absolutely loved everything about this venue and can't recommend it highly enough!

taff at Saratoga Springs were friendly, kind, and easy to work with. Throughout the entire planning process, they were only an email away, and they responded to our questions promptly, no matter how simple or complex they were. They are very experienced at holding weddings at their venue, and their experience lessened the load on us as the couple. We also found the cost of holding our wedding there to be a great value for the Bay Area, and from the very beginning, they were transparent with us about their pricing and services, unlike other venues we contacted. We got compliments all night on how beautiful the venue was. We held our ceremony and reception in Cathedral Grove, which felt secluded despite being relatively accessible. Our families were also very impressed by how quickly and efficiently the staff took care of the details of our event behind the scenes. They helped to do things like remove the chairs from our ceremony and pack up our dessert at the end of the night quickly and discreetly. Saratoga Springs was a perfect middle ground between an all-inclusive venue and a DIY venue for us. They provided and coordinated a lot (for instance, rentals for chairs and the china and linens) but also allowed us to bring in our own vendors, including the catering, the florist, and the photographer. They provided a list of recommended vendors, which was a very helpful starting point for us. In the end, we used a caterer and a florist that they recommended, and since our vendors were familiar with the venue, they worked together seamlessly. Our wedding was everything we imagined and more, and we couldn't have done it without their help!

elegant and natural vibe we were going for. Our event was at the Longbridge location, which didn’t feel too big for our ~110 guests. There was another wedding taking place at the Cathedral location at the same time, but there were no issues with parking availability, sound, etc. The venue is also wheelchair accessible and great for kids! The food was awesome and got rave reviews from all of our guests. The kitchen was able to accommodate our requests for vegan options (using margarine instead of butter for garlic bread, etc.), and our guests enjoyed being able to see (and smell) the food being prepared on the open grills throughout the ceremony. Sam and Olivia were also very responsive and helped provide clear direction on the day of the ceremony to make sure everyone knew where they needed to be and that all of the ceremony cues happened on time. Knowing what we know, we wouldn’t hesitate to book at Saratoga Springs if we were to do this all over again. Highly recommend!

ucky that there were no other events at the venue the day we had our wedding, so we had the entire place to ourselves. The food was WONDERFUL, and everyone raved about it! Staff the day-of was also great. We planned our wedding during the pandemic, so we negotiated some terms in our contract to address that, and it was a close call when the local regulations almost didn't open up in time for us to be able to have a reception at all. The venue was unbending about following the guidelines, which we completely understand - our only complaint is that they didn't specifically communicate with us during the period they were closed to receptions. We just happened to find out, by asking a lot of questions, that they were closed and essentially just crossing their fingers hoping things would open up before our date rolled around. It would have been nice if they had directly and clearly communicated this to us so we could start making a back-up plan sooner. However, they were very approachable when we did discuss this with them and the possibility we may have to go elsewhere. In the end, we were able to keep our original plans, and we are SO glad we did, because it was exactly what we had been planning and hoping for! We highly recommend this venue if you're looking for a beautiful natural setting, friendly staff, and good food!

After I got engaged, I immediately started searching for the perfect wedding venue. I dreamed about getting married in an outdoor venue where both the ceremony and reception would ...

be held between tall forest trees. The Cathedral Grove area at Saratoga Springs was the perfect venue for my summer wedding in July 2019. What you need to know is that while the site fee was on the lower side, everything was essentially a la carte. The only things that the site fee covered were the twinkling lights, tables, and coordinators for the day of. However, the cost overall spent on the venue (i.e. table setting, additional wine barrel tables, chairs, etc.) was good for a Bay Area wedding. The DJ and photobooth had to be booked through the venue, but everything else you could choose outside vendors. My husband and I chose Saratoga Springs to cater the food and drinks… We had the chicken & tri-tip package with all you can drink wine & beer. It was perfect for the venue and we received compliments from guests on the food. My favorite parts of the venue were the babbling creak, the area behind Cathedral Grove, the long picnic tables, and twinkling lights. Shout out to Samantha, Olivia, and Jennifer who made the special day possible. I adored the venue and the customer service provided by the staff was excellent! Thank you, Saratoga Springs!

Saratoga Springs was a great combination of the outdoor beauty, uniqueness & a relatively easier outdoor venue to reach for our wedding guests, relative to the alternatives we tour...

ed. Beautiful trees, greenery and a calming stream highlight some of the natural beauty of the venue. It's unique charm lies in the epic bridge of the longbridge site or the enchanting coziness of cathedral grove (the two sites we toured). My wife & I were looking for a site that was not super formal, but could also be an enchanting nighttime affair, which we felt like longbridge had the potential for. Additionally, although there is about 2 miles of winding roads if you drive through downtown Saratoga, this was definitely one of the easier roads to traverse compared to other outdoor venues that were at least 5 miles or longer. We worked with the team of Olivia & Sam. Olivia was our primary point of contact. Both were great throughout the process! They communicated well with us and answered all our gazillion questions (we had a 70+ long email thread). They were also prompt, detailed and upfront with us regarding costs and many other details. They were also flexible with changes we requested as the wedding approached. The bridal fair they hold during March is also very valuable in terms of meeting preferred vendors, seeing different set ups and trying out their food! Since we have a large Asian family, we did decide to bring in outside catering (our relatives had probably never been to an outdoor wedding, so we wanted to make sure there was an element of familiarity for them). Saratoga Springs graciously permitted us to work with them and helped us work out kitchen equipment rentals. On the day of, we also had an amazing day of wedding coordinator since we also had a tea ceremony, almost 200 guests and vendors working with Saratoga Springs for the first time. The night went smoothly and from our end. My wife & I and our guests had a wonderful evening because of the combined efforts of all our vendors. I think the one possible hiccup was the delay/confusion with the vendor meals we had ordered-- we wanted to make sure all our hard working vendors who were making the night go & capturing memories had enough energy for the marathon. Overall, Olivia & Sam helped us so much along the way and on the day of to make our wedding so fun, memorable & special. The rest of their staff was great was well! Sam also gave us a fun golf cart ride to our car at the end of the night :) Saratoga Springs is an amazing venue and many of our guests told us it was beautiful, romantic and overall a great venue!

Saratoga Springs was the best venue choice we could have ever made. Our wedding looked even better than we could have ever imagined - it was magical! My husband and I were touring...

sites earlier in the year, and while looking through several websites discovered Saratoga Springs. The immediate draw was the price point! The fact that they could host so many guests while not blowing the budget was a big bonus. So we reached out to get a tour set up. Jennifer, their Director of Celebrations, responded almost immediately with some of the most thorough information I have ever received. That correspondence definitely set the chain of events off to a good start. When we toured the site with her a few days later, the creeks were overflown with water after a winter of heavy rain. That sound was so soothing... I'm convinced that's what made us fall in love with the place. We loved the venue so much, we made a decision to reserve our date on the car ride home. After that, we worked closely with Olivia and Samantha over the months to get everything organized and arranged. They were extremely responsive and patient and helpful, and never once tried to push us to spend on something they thought was "too much". At rehearsal and on the day of, Samantha was our coordinator and guided us through pretty much everything. She checked in with us frequently to make sure we had everything we needed. It was so nice to see her friendly face, and it was so assuring to know that she was on top of everything. Saratoga Springs was also extremely flexible about letting us try to set up a tulle drape over the big branch of the big tree on longbridge - something we wanted as our ceremony arch. It looked amazing in the end, and we're thankful that Olivia and Sam were supportive every step of the way. Apart from one unprofessional server on the night of, our experience was extremely wonderful. Thank you so much Saratoga Springs, especially to Olivia and Sam. You are all amazing!

Pretty much everything was taken care of by her and she was so incredibly easy to work with... she even jumped in to help when there was a bit of a food fiasco, which was an add on our part, and not part of her job. We opted for a brunch wedding, with traditional breakfast foods, champagne mimosas, a coffee cart, and fun lawn games. We just had our year anniversary (I know, such a late review), but everyone STILL talks about how beautiful the venue was!
