If I could rate 10 stars, I would. Natalie was amazing to work with. Originally, I wanted to DIY my flowers, but as the date got closer, I got super stressed, and Natalie came to...

my rescue. We had our wedding at the Brazilian Room in the East Bay and she's done a lot of weddings there. She executed my vision perfectly. I wanted minimalist flowers but bright, whimsical, with a twist of tropical florals. She delivered!! I would highly encourage you to reach out to her. She's also a joy to talk to. P.S. My ceremony was at SF City Hall earlier in the day, and her sweet husband hand-delivered them to my now husband! They are both the greatest.

We were floored by how MAGICAL our wedding looked thanks to Belle Flower's creative touch. From our first consultation, Natalie had a kind, attentive, reassuring vibe. We value her...

professional input, exceptional communication, and her eye for detail. We asked for a pastel theme displaying a spectrum of hydrangeas, wild flowers, roses, ferns, and olive leaves. Natalie truly captured our vision and adorned our venue with fresh, bright, stunning, unforgettable floral arrangements. Moreover, it has been over 2 weeks since the wedding and some our flowers are still thriving at our home!

We hired Natalie as our florist for our wedding earlier this week at the Brazilian Room. We booked Natalie back in June of 2022, and she was so sweet from the beginning to help ens...

ure me that we could have beautiful flowers at our budget. Leading up to the wedding, my maid of honor and I went to Natalie's studio for a consultation, and we were able to talk through our design inspiration. My husband and I loved how the flowers turned out and thought they made our ceremony arch, cake, centerpieces, basically everything, so beautiful! They looked amazing in our photos.

I cannot speak more highly of Natalie. We just had our wedding in Berkeley, at Comal, and Natalie created the most gorgeous arrangements for us. My bridal bouquet was stunning- it ...

was better than I could have imagined but didn't swallow up my tiny 4'11" frame :) Natalie is so attuned to how to dress up a space, she paid close attention to my color palette, and was so supportive of my vision. She's also just a lovely person- in our first meeting, we just chatted for over an hour (not just about flowers!) and I felt like I was with an old friend. My goal was to work with vendors who didn't just have phenomenal work, but were great people who I was excited to spend time with...Natalie was exactly that. I would recommend her over and over again.

We hired Natalie to do the arrangements for our wedding and we absolutely could not be happier with how it turned out. Working with Natalie was a breeze, from emails and phone call...

s, through to actually visiting her in her studio a few weeks before the wedding to finalize details, she was always quick to reply, gave us great suggestions of how to make our budget go further, and was wonderful throughout the process. The flowers themselves on the day were gorgeous, and Natalie ensured that everything looked just right at both our venues as well as helping the groomsmen with boutonnieres etc. If you’re looking for a fantastic florist in the Bay Area, you won’t find anyone better than Natalie

rive til the night before and although she was a bit stressed she never let me know she just handled it and had a back up plan in case. Belle is so easy to work with and she knows her stuff. She works with you to achieve the look you want while staying within your budget.
