r crew and red camera. Our entire experience had been just flawless from the moment I called their phone (Chris called me back from the plane!), they have been communicating throughout planning, accommodated all our requests, went above and beyond. The crew was extremely professional, talented and seamless. We hardly noticed their presence while our long day was documented in amazing quality artistic photo and video story from multiple angles and perspectives including drone! The short video, long video are edited to perfection while totally authentic, heartwarming and true to reality. We are so grateful and totally agree with other reviewer who said that they "cannot wait for another occasion as a reason to hire Symboll again"! Chris, Shant, Misha, Yulia, Kris, Attila, Mo and everybody else, thank you all at Symboll from the bottom of our hearts for doing an incredible job immortalizing our special day!!!

When we first found Symboll Studio, we were a little hesitant because their package pricing was more than what we were initially budgeting for the photo/video. HOWEVER, IT WAS THE ...

BEST CALL ever we made for our wedding! NO REGRET AT ALL! I know it's a lot of money for most people but it's once in a lifetime thing and it's worth the money. The team who helped us the entirety of the wedding, they were super professional, they knew what they were doing. The equipment is very high-end, and they are super friendly and exciting to work with. I like their look, and art directions, very easy to communicate with as well.

In addition, he remained very flexible till the last minute when we found out our initial idea wasn’t coming together because the flowers just hadn’t bloomed yet.

With a quick Google search of photographers, thousands of vendors popped up. I began to put their websites down on my spreadsheets & collected quotes, hours, number of photographer...

s, etc. I came across Symboll & what drew me in was their website. It was so beautifully designed & everything was easy to navigate around. I am used to being the photographer & videographer for my friends & family, so I was looking for something extraordinary that I cannot create myself. I love story telling & art, so when I looked at their ABOUT page, I was floored. It was speaking to me! After looking around their site for 30 minutes, I called & didn’t leave a message because I was tired & it was the 11th call I did on a Sunday morning (April 7). A few minutes later, I received a text message from the number I called. It was Christian saying good morning & apologized for not being able to pick up our call because he was currently at a wedding, but asked how he may be of assistance to us. He asked when our wedding date was to see if it was available & fortunately it was! He asked us a few questions about how many hours of coverage we need for our date & explained some of the things they specialized in. He explained the RED camera they offer, but also allowed us to do our due diligence to decide what we truly wanted. The C2 package was popular, but after all my research, we ultimately decided to do the C3 package with add-ons for engagement shoot, drone, RED camera & full movie edit. We felt that this package would truly help capture all the precious moments that will live on forever not only in our hearts & minds but literally for the whole world & future generations of our family to see! I loved the cinematics & artful beauty of all their work. I watched all the videos & the RED camera was sharper than the normal one. It’s the same camera they use for Netflix & movies. I figured if we are paying this much for our wedding, we are going to have the best photographers & videographers. I’m definitely telling my kids & grandkids that our wedding video was “Crazy Rich Asians” LOL We texted Christian what we wanted & within minutes he sent us an updated quote & omg was it a great deal. Their standard hours of coverage were 2 to 4 hours more than all the other vendors I contacted. Their price was insanely competitive. They presented great previous work on their website. They also have an FAQ page which actually answered a lot of our questions. Their pricing was straight forward with no hidden fees. We had no travel fee because our wedding is located in their local regions. I was reassured that they have a close knit team of photographers, videographers & editors that work well together & it will not be some random Joe they found on Craigslist to fill the 3rd or 4th shooter position. Christian assured us that we will be meeting our lead photographer & videographer on our engagement shoot & also will have a meeting with them before our wedding. Christian was so easy to work with & was oh so patient with us & all our many questions. It felt like he was one of our friends wanting the best for us. He even helped advocate for us to get the best deals. We just signed our contract today (April 9) & paid the first portion of the total to secure our date! I cannot stress enough about how great Christian was to us & how excellent his customer service was. His patience & kindness knows no bounds. If you have made it this far into my review then I suggest you call or text Christian & mention Catherine & Henry hehe I am very skeptical about people texting me so I assure you that contacting that number will get you the best human you could ever speak to regarding photography & videography needs. I can’t even put into words how thankful we are for Christian’s help throughout this stressful process. He made it super easy & was never pushy or made us feel like he was upselling or forcing us to do something we did not want to do. I am so excited for our engagement photoshoot & wedding photos & video! THANK YOU CHRISTIAN!

Planning a wedding is hard. Choosing a photographer and videographer is a critical decision for any couple. Individual photographers are busy and non-responsive. They can be flaky ...

too. We went through a couple false starts before we found Symboll, and everything got easier once we did. They are incredibly organized, with a well-planned intake process and production pipeline. Their team approach and roster of shooters gave us a ton of confidence (versus hiring an individual photographer and hoping they're really going to show up!). At the event, the shooters all showed tremendous confidence in their work, which gave my wife and I confidence posing for them. (Such an important part of the process!) They were friendly, looked professional, managed our guests with courtesy and everyone was super impressed with the Symboll team. (The guests imagined we spent much more than we did, because they sent us an army - two photographers, a third photographer in training, and a videographer/drone pilot.) It will be a few weeks until we receive our packages (which we understood up front, and is expected) so I will come back and post our reaction to the final work when we get it, but so far, so great! You should definitely hire Symboll for your wedding or event. We couldn't be happier!

t signed a contract to work with Symboll for photography and videography. Christian was the main point of contact that responded to my initial reach out and he has been nothing but extremely understanding and helpful. We knew we were reaching out to a company that really puts out quality into their work and we had the expectations that it may be above our budget, which it was. However as we spoke to Christian more and more, he worked closely with us to discuss what Symboll can do to come within range. We are very excited to work with Symboll and will update this review with our experiences working with Symboll once we have our wedding.

We are so glad to have found Symboll to be our wedding photographer and videographer. We wanted unique photos and videos with a clean editing style that wouldn’t appear overly filt...

ered, and Symboll checked every one of those boxes. We opted for the C2 package with RED videography, which was priced incredibly competitively considering the quality of work. Additionally, it came with up to 10 hours of coverage by default whereas most other vendors we looked at typically offered 8 hours. Working with them was a breeze. It started with messaging their client managers Christian and Attila who broke down their transparent and simple pricing structure. After payment, they sent a helpful questionnaire not only to help Symboll get to know us, but also allow us to narrow down what we wanted. They were always super quick to respond to our questions, and we never felt lost along the process. We were ultimately connected with Shant as our photographer and Misha as our videographer, and we were so lucky to have them on our wedding day. Both were incredibly professional, kind, and overall joys to work with. Importantly, our wedding happened to fall on a day with suboptimal weather (end of March 2024). It rained heavily for much of the day, and we had booked a largely outdoor venue (Rancho Las Lomas). Despite this, Shant and Misha were incredibly flexible to the wet conditions. These unique circumstances also highlighted the strength of Symboll’s creativity, as Shant and Misha took advantage of the storm to create some incredibly cinematic shots of us. We were so glad to have chosen Symboll when we saw our photos, since we are confident that few other photographers/videographers would have been able to leverage our unfavorable weather conditions like Shant and Misha did. Because of the weather, they were unable to use their drone to capture our day, but they provided us with a teaser reel video in addition to our feature film. Final photos came out beautifully and the short film came back in such a timely manner. We are so happy with the results!

We chose Symboll because we loved the samples of the wedding videos that were in their portfolio! We loved the cinematic’s and immediately wanted our video to be like that. We love...

how the Symboll style looks effortless and artful. Our photos seem to capture the moment in an authentic way while also looking ethereal and intimate. The way Symboll used an easy portal system to get to know you and where you can pick out many music options for your video. It was also nice to have talked to the team before the wedding to go over the final timeline! Our day-of experience was very smooth, the team was always right there when we needed them and they captured everything! Our experience was smooth and professional. Thank you Symboll team!

. I loved their style and didn't want regular photos that look like they can be taken from an iPhone. This was especially important to me given that my friends regretted hiring their photographers who didn't do a great job. Christian immediately reached out to me, provided many options for me to choose from, answered all my questions and provided me with a recent video they did at the exact same wedding venue as mine. Thereafter, I was assigned to Agata as my photographer and Andranik as the videographer. Working with them during my wedding was a dream. They were perfectionists, took charge, had a unique artistic vision for every single shot and made sure to capture the right dramatic shots. I loved loved loved working with them and cannot recommend them enough!!!! I am so excited to see how the photos and video turn out. I already know it's going to be incredible. I'll update my post once I get the photos. THANK YOU SYMBOLL!

I was so impressed with the final video. I never had a "vision" for what the video would be, but once I saw it, I thought "this is exactly what I wanted". Can not recommend them enough.

Can’t thank Symboll enough for being there with my partner and I on our special day! We had the pleasure of meeting David, our photographer and Eugene, our videographer. They were ...

prompt and got to business right away. They were creative, had really unique ideas of where to position the bridal party. I especially loved how hands on David was. He told us exactly how to pose, what body positions to do to make the shot seem effortless. We didn’t have to think about angles at all. He was an expert! Both had great attitudes and were such a pleasure to be around. Thanks for being there and braving the Palm Springs heat!

st so fun and personable and made us feel like a million bucks. Our lead photographer Julio and lead videographer Dean were so fun to work with and would always hype us up when we got a really good shot to the point where it was hard to "focus" when we would do more serious or romantic glances but in the best way. They really took their time with our romantic shots and were also super receptive to our bridal party wanting specific photos as well. They also worked so well with our live painter so that they could send him the photo we selected so he had a good reference when working on our painting. All in all we loved working with this team and we cannot wait to see the final photos and the final video as well.

e special moments of our big day was truly impressive. His photographs are absolutely stunning and not only reflect the joy and love of our wedding day but also honestly captured the essence of our friends and family. After shooting our wedding, to our surprise, we found out that Shant was actually a photographer we had admired on instagram for years prior. The serendipity of getting to work with him made the experience of working with Symboll all the more magical! We also loved our wedding film that was shot by John Mark who made us feel really comfortable in front of the camera. His positive and upbeat attitude was infectious and kept us smiling and laughing throughout the day! Such good energy! So so thankful to the videographers and editing team!!! Finally, we also appreciate the accommodation and patience shown to us by Attila and the Symboll admin team who were nothing but helpful and accommodating when we had a medical emergency that caused our wedding plans to change. I know our requests and circumstances weren’t the easiest to deal with, but they made it work seamlessly in ensuring we were happy at every step.

It was so fun to look back at all the little details of the day. Our wedding truly was a magical day & we are so lucky to have had Symboll capture that memory for us. They made it so authentic to our personality & really captured our love!! If you’re looking for a videographer, hire Symboll!

My wife and I had an outstanding experience with Symboll! From the early stages, their communication was excellent, which made it very easy to work out the details of our wedding. ...

We did a three day fusion wedding (Indian, Chinese, Mexican), so we required several videographers and photographers. They sent us the best crew who covered every aspect of our events. A special shout-out to Misha (lead videographer) and Shant (lead photographer). Not only are they super kind individuals, they are masters at their craft, and are very open to feedback to ensure the final product is exactly what you want. As part of our package, we had an engagement shoot prior to the wedding and we worked with Shant and John-Michael. The photos came out eipic and were very editorial. These guys and their truly crew went above and beyond for us. I would highly suggest checking out Symboll if you are in search of a talented, professional, and friendly group to cover all your wedding media needs.

Chris and I were able to put together our summer wedding on July 31st, 2020 in Paso Robles at CaliPaso Wine & Villa. We reached out to Daniel who owns and runs a team of fantastic ...

photographers, videographers, and film editors. He really took the time to prepare and set up for our extraordinary wedding/elopement. We asked to have a live feed via youtube for our families overseas and he pulled it off using an iphone- only the wifi and cell service in the area wasn't great which they couldn't help, but no matter - I highly recommend a final video of the entire ceremony professionally captured by his high quality camera and audio setup. That was much more of a valuable, priceless capture. The short 2.5 minute trailer was created along with the longer version 22 mins of the story build up, the ceremony and the last champagne celebration part. Egor took the role of photography and he did an excellent job capturing all the critical parts of the afternoon and evening. His work was top notch and he made sure that we were getting the shots we asked for. They are both super friendly, but made sure they worked hard. They came a long way from LA to make sure we could make this happen. Chris and I loved the outcome of both the photos and videos. We have watched them dozens of times and felt this was a worthwhile investment for any couple who want to relive their wedding experience. Not only that their streamlined process of choosing the video music and website setup was easy and professional. Please take the time to see their channel and hire them! You won't regret it.

e than happy to answer. And their answers were very helpful because of their experience and insight. They are very confident in the service they provide; they know exactly their style, look and abilities. I'm not a big fan when someone is wishy-washy in their answers, or changes their response based on what they think you want to hear. This team knows what their bringing to the table and because we knew what we wanted it worked out perfectly. They are social, friendly and easy going; you have to be able to maneuver under the circumstances of a wedding which means a variety of different people and personalities. You have to know when to ease back and when to step up and take charge. Cinestory had it. The final product was delivered in the amount of time and as agreed. We love our video and pictures and couldn't be happier. Thanks again Cinestory!
