DJ Goyo and his partner Priscilla rocked the house at our weekend wedding at a summer camp, bringing all the vibes and doing it at a very affordable price, too. Thank you, DJ Goyo!

We chose to work with DJ Goyo after our initial dj unexpectedly bailed on us. We were so glad that we had the opportunity to hire DJ Goyo. He chatted with us before and shared his ...

skill set and ensured us that he is able to accommodated our music preferences. He brought his vinyls which was such a huge hit with our crowd. Guests were dancing all night long. He made sure there were smooth transitions between each of the events and had such energy. He did such a great job reading the crowd and providing some great music. We highly recommend dj Goyo!

DJ Goyo is simply the coolest! Recommended by our event coordinator, we were thrilled to have easily discovered a wedding DJ who has a true love of music, for vinyl, and is a consu...

mmate professional. His passion for his work clearly shows. After learning our musical tastes, he excitedly shared the records he pulled just for us. Throughout our wedding day and night, he provided ambient music during the cocktail reception and seated dinner, microphones for speeches, and created a lively disco dance experience we will never forget. Without needing any extra handholding or direction, he expertly moved the party along with announcements and perfectly timed music cues. I think one of our favorite moments was our last dance, with only our immediate family still on the premises, dancing privately to "Perfect Day" by Lou Reed. We were so happy and full of love. And we thank DJ Goyo for providing the musical backdrop to our perfect day.
