I cannot believe how beautiful my flowers were. Anita with Wine Country Flowers was incredible. She was communicative, gave a very detailed breakdown of everything I was getting, ...

Anita/Wine Country Flowers is AMAZING! We used Wine Country Flowers for our wedding flowers in October. Flowers were a center piece at our wedding and we had it used as our main de...

corations. They did incredible work with all of our different floral arrangements! Throughout the whole process, Anita took the time to really understand our vision and color scheme. Every color and flower she chose was exactly what we were looking for! A couple weeks before our wedding, we had one final call and she even added a few missing items we had last minute to make sure our night was perfect! One example was that Anita was sweet enough to include a small floral arrangement for our cake last minute. She arrived onsite early to our venue and did all the set up seamlessly. She even took the time to put on the boutonnieres on all the men and showed the women how to hold the bouquet correctly for the best pictures. I truly cannot recommend Wine Country Flowers enough, they did amazing and we received so many compliments throughout the whole night! Thank you so much Anita for all you did!

etely blew me away. Anita was the first florist I talked to and after meeting with her and having the chance to see her barn and some of her work I was completely inspired and absolutely loved her energy! Her excitement and passion for flowers and weddings is contagious! I had provided some inspiration and colors but other that I trusted Anita to create what she thought would look best in the space. And once I got to the aisle to see all the work she had done I was speechless! Our guests commented all evening (and still do) about how stunning our flowers were throughout the wedding! They completely transformed our venue and will be something I will remember forever! Thank you Anita for all that you do!!! P.S. it was 100+ degrees on our wedding day and not sure how she did it but our flowers looked stunning the entire evening!

Anita Isaza, owner of Wine Country Flowers, is a florist of astonishing talent, with deep expertise in her craft and a steadfast work ethic. While I had a very defined sense of the...

style and palette I wanted for our wedding, I am not knowledgeable about flowers. My talented planner, Kendra Nixon, recommended Anita to me—an absolutely brilliant call that I will always be grateful for! Anita guided us every step of the way, curating a stunning floral selection that was pitch perfect for the season, our venue, and our style. She was an easy-going collaborator who immediately understood and embraced our vision, contributing substantively to make it better. Anita was the one who came up with the idea of the gorgeous tree wrap for our ceremony—something I never would have conceived of but absolutely loved. And while Anita is big on vision, she also digs in and gets the work done, on time and in budget. I never had to worry about that. She worked seamlessly with our planner, our baker and our other vendors. When the bowls I had bought for the dining table bouquets ended up being too small, she helped us find new ones, get them painted to coordinate perfectly with our table settings, and even went above and beyond to arrange for the sale of the bowls we weren’t using. From a day filled with love and beauty, Anita’s flowers have emerged as one of our very favorite memories. I still tear up every time I see the flowers in our pictures, and I know my darling husband and I will always treasure their beauty when we look at our pictures over our lifetimes together. I whole heartedly recommend Anita and her team at Wine Country Flowers as you make plans for the wedding of your dreams. My very best wishes to you.

Anita was an absolute delight! She's creative, enthusiastic, professional, and flexible. She was able to work with our budget and create something that exceeded our expectations! ...

When my mom and I arrived at her barn in Sonoma country, we were met with warm, positive, reassuring energy. Anita was a great thought partner; she walked me through options and inspirational photos for my vision to take shape! She offered up great suggestions, including, but not limited to: decorating my grandma's (a former florist) walker, having my other two granmas as flower girls, a flower pillow made out of fresh flowers for our ring bearer, and my favorite, the most beautiful array of fresh flowers for my hair that made my look unique and vibrant. Anita was on top of everything from start to finish, checking in with me on floor plans, guest counts, etc., and she even fulfilled my last-minute request for an extra 200+ extra candle votives around the barrel room. I wish I could get married again just to hang out with Anita! Book with her, and you will not regret it. She's the energy that all brides need!

we wanted and was able to execute flawlessly. Anita is also unique in that you can visit her at her barn and get a trial run going. She'll have the arrangement ready to take a look at, and you can make adjustments with her on the spot. This gave us so much confidence in the arrangements before the event. Anita also keeps up with buying new and creative urns/arbors for your events. The urns she used for our event were incredible and quite honestly jaw dropping. If we ever have another event in wine country, Anita will be my first call!

ute on my dream flowers. Everything went off without a hitch and I am so in love with the flowers that they provided us. They were able to execute flawlessly on my lantern center pieces, large bridal party order, and sweetheart table garland with impeccable attention to detail. They were recommended to us by our Rehearsal Dinner venue (Europe Village) and they definitely deserve the recommendation. I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for flowers for their event.

Amazing Florist & Beautiful Flowers! Working with Anita and her team was a dream! It was so easy and fun to work with her and she made sure every single detail matched our vision....

At the start of our wedding planning we came to her with a very specific vision; all white flowers that were lush and full of texture mixed with floating candles throughout. And with Anita this all came to life better than we could have ever expected! Anita’s flowers shined not only at our reception, but also at our church wedding ceremony as she created pieces that tied the two venues together into one cohesive look. Not only was she able to get amazing florals to both venues, but she even hand delivered herself my bouquet (which she added personal touches to for me) on my wedding day. We’re still getting compliments on how beautiful the tables were and how amazing the room smelled from all the fresh flowers! Everything turned out more beautiful than we could have ever imagined and cannot recommend Anita enough!

nowledgeable she is about floral design. I explained my vision to her in very broad terms and just let her have creative freedom to work her magic -- this was the best thing we could have done! Trust the process, and trust Anita! She gave us the wedding of our dreams and to this day, we continue to get compliments from our guests on the floral design! Besides the technical skills and know-how, Anita and her team were also a dream to work with. We had two ceremonies, with different styles, on the same day followed by a reception. Her team worked around the clock to ensure the set up was complete on schedule. They even went above and beyond to move the arch and large vases from our second ceremony to the reception so we could use them as a backdrop to the sweetheart table, which was STUNNING! Anita is truly the best in the business - we loved everything she created for our wedding and we loved working with her even more!

r all of the details to make sure she knew exactly what we wanted. When it came time to go over more in depth details and pricing she was always fast to respond and always got back to us in a timely manner. She was more than willing to modify pieces we really wanted to make sure it was closer to the price range we were looking for while still keeping our vision intact! Anita is literally amazing. The day of our wedding when everything arrived it was exactly how I envisioned and the colors were perfect! I don’t know how she does it! A short while before the wedding I realized I needed more floral for our guest entryway. Anita took the time to make an amazing chandelier piece to go over our guest card table. Trust her visions they are amazing! It looked like something out of a movie! If you’re looking for a vendor that is willing to go above and beyond and really take the time to make sure your vision comes to life, hire Anita!

My bridal bouquet was the single most gorgeous flower arrangement I have ever seen. Every guest commented the flowers and table garlands – Anita’s flowers transformed our event spaces into the romantic wedding of our dreams. We would recommend Anita and her team at Wine Country Flowers without hesitation. Great planning experience, with a perfect wedding day beyond our expectations!

I contacted Anita (& a few other florists) last year when I started wedding planning. Her initial quote was not bad compared to others. I LOVED the pictures I saw online of her wor...

k & style. I wanted classic, lush elegance. Not a fan of the loose bouquets with lots of greenery that're so popular now. She invited me to her farm to chat & see more. Since flowers were important to me, my mom & I made the trek from the East Bay. We instantly loved Anita! She was so warm, welcoming & personable. I booked her for my date soon after! Throughout wedding planning Anita was in touch, making sure to get details from me that would help with the vision. I knew she got me & my vision and knew my flowers would be gorgeous. I actually made some last minute changes to the centerpieces, to which she did not mind at all. I felt so bad, but she assured me it's normal to be indecisive while planning my wedding!! lol The thing I was most impressed with... while making changes to centerpieces, I threw some ideas out. Anita helped me to work with my budget, the overall vision (my reception was in Gloria Ferrer's wine cave), assuring that everything would be aesthetically appealing & "make sense". I easily would have spent more money (hubs wouldn't have been happy!), but Anita changed my layout to what would look best, & it actually saved me money!! Planning a wedding, you often feel like some vendors are trying to add-on, then your budget spirals out of control. NOT the case with Anita! When my wedding day came Anita personally delivered my bouquet. I was beyond stressed & anxious, but seeing her and my gorgeous bouquet made me so happy. I can't say enough about Anita & her team. So many guests could not believe how gorgeous my centerpieces were, and myself and my bridesmaids all loved our bouquets. I will say, almost 4 months later, I am still heartbroken that my photographers somehow "forgot" to take photos of the centerpieces. They were one of my FAVORITE things about my wedding. Sigh! :( Well, if you are thinking about booking Wine Country Flowers for your wedding, do it! Do it NOW! You will quickly learn through wedding planning that the best vendors get booked quickly. & Anita and her team are the best!

oorly-defined ideas, and she turned them into pure creative gold. She made the most incredible hanging vines under the canopy where we married and the bouquets and table flowers were to die for. I am embarrassed to say that carried one of them around for two days after the wedding before we left for the honeymoon. I seriously thought about bringing one on the plane with me.... Every time I talk to someone about the wedding we talk about the flowers. The price was reasonable, Anita was awesome. She did exactly what she said she would do and outperformed our expectations. She is our MVP of the wedding vendors and I cannot say enough good things about her work.

n mind and was worried I was not communicating what I wanted well. Turns out I got married during THE WORST rainy season we’ve had in years. I refused to acknowledge that my “dream outdoor ceremony” was no longer possible. At 12pm the day of my wedding we made the call to move it indoors, needless to say I was an OCD mess. When I arrived at the venue all of my nerves and stress had immediately gone away. Anita was there and she had it handled. Every detail was perfect, every flower arrangement was breathtaking, every unknown was answered with something I could of never imagined. She put together my true dream ceremony within hours. She was a joy to work, creative, inspiring and I feel blessed that I got the opportunity to work with her. If you are on the fence about picking a florist Anita is your girl!

howed me several albums full of bouquets, centerpieces, buttonieres and corsages, ideas to frame the altar, etc. I pointed to flowers I liked along with other ideas for centerpieces, etc. Anita took copious notes and made sure she repeated and clarified my expectations throughout the appointment and after the meeting. I also sent her a swatch of my matron of honor's dress to match with the flowers. She delivered gorgeous bouquets and centerpieces the day of the event, was on time, professional and friendly. She responded to any questions I had throughout the process. At times, she took longer to respond than others due to the busy wedding season. But this was to be expected with any of the great wedding vendors during their busy time (i.e. the summer). People that attended the wedding that are very into flowers were obsessed with the size, color and quality of the flowers in all of the arrangements. One thing to note, the corsage for the mother of the groom would not go on her dress so she had to carry it around. I would have asked to have one made into a corsage worn on the wrist in case this happened. The flowers were unbelievably gorgeous! We had 3 tall centerpieces, 3 short centerpieces, 2 7 ft candleabras, several boutonnieres, a decorative rose petal design scrolling the aisle, 2 bouquets, lots of candles, cake flowers and flowers for the coffee table.

Anita from Wine Country Flowers did the flowers for our November wedding as part of the “Hummingbird Package” at Mark West Lodge. The flowers at our wedding were beautiful-—the ...

bouquets were gorgeous, the boutonnieres and corsages turned out nicely, and the table centerpieces were pretty. (The centerpieces did turn out more pink than I had hoped, but I understand that flowers don’t really come in a true “brown”, and Anita was very clear about that from the beginning, so I am not holding that against anyone.) However, the process to get to this point was frustrating, and I had several communication problems. My first consultation was not with Anita, but with her employee, Becky. Becky seemed knowledgeable and friendly, and by the end of the meeting we had laid out exactly what I wanted. However, when Anita wrote up the quote a few days later and emailed it to me, a handful of things had changed. Some of them were just errors (the color of the bridesmaids bouquets was wrong) but some things had been changed without consulting me or asking what I wanted (the flowers in the mothers’ corsages had been changed). We eventually got everything fixed and back to where I wanted it, but it was frustrating-—no one emailed or called me to say “you know, calla lilies don’t hold up very well in wrist corsages, maybe you should try roses or orchids instead?” They just changed it in the event order. I also had trouble contacting Anita when necessary. A couple months before the wedding, I emailed her a question on a Friday, and she said she could get back to me Monday or Tuesday because she was swamped with weddings. Understandable, except that I had to email her again because I still hadn’t heard from her by the end of Tuesday. When we set up our final call before the wedding, Anita was supposed to call me at 7pm. When I still hadn’t heard from her by 7:30pm I sent her an email, and an hour later she emailed me back “Sorry I had it as a reminder on my iPhone but missed it...” and rescheduled the call for 7pm the next day. In another context this wouldn’t have been a big deal, but as a bride, the last couple of weeks before the wedding are very busy, and I didn’t have time to be waiting by the phone two evenings in a row. Overall the flowers were beautiful, but the whole process was more stressful than it should have been. I understand that Anita has a lot going on in her life right now (she just adopted a baby earlier this year), but I felt like Anita didn’t value my time (not emailing or calling when she said she would) and was not apologetic about it. 5 stars for the flowers, 1 star for communication = 3 stars

Anita and her staff provided beautiful wedding flowers! Anita was very thorough during the initial meetings and went through all of the details for the wedding flowers. She also ...

provided detailed documentation regarding the types of flowers and colors that would be used. I appreciated her prompt responses to my questions and her attention to detail. During the wedding day Anita and her staff brought all of the flowers personally and they were more beautiful than I could have imagined. The venue looked like a fairytale thanks to the amazing flowers! I would highly recommend Wine Country Flowers!

Anita with Wine Country Flowers is amazing!! I met with many different florists for my Sonoma wedding, and she completely blew me away! She was an absolute pleasure to work with. ...

She is incredibly hardworking, has a great sense of humor, excellent taste, and truly listened to what I wanted! And, she knows her stuff! I went in with a pretty clear vision of what I wanted, and she was able to completely see my vision, and give insights to make it that much more spectacular! She made stunningly unique centerpieces for the reception, and the personal flowers were amazing! She thought through every little detail, and I could not have been more impressed! I have received endless compliments on her work! I would not have changed a thing! Thank you, Anita, for making my wedding day vision a reality!

r and the dinner table center pieces. I was able to share my ideas with Anita and show a few sample pictures in one appointment. Two months later without further consultation, those ideas came to life bigger and better than I ever thought they could. During that one appointment I showed Anita a piture of the bouquet I wanted. I did not leave it with her. On my wedding day that exact bouquet was given to me. Amazing! Wine Country Flowers is very professional and the talent for creation and presetnation is unbelievable.;Be respectful of the talent. I came in with ideas that were all over the place. Respect their ability to narrow down what flowers you want, what flowers you can get depending on the season and what colors are realistic.
