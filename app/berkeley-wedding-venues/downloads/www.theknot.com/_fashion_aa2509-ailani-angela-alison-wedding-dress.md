Description

Ailani brings together elegance and whimsy with her strapless short wedding dress silhouette that’s perfect for beach, destination, or boho-inspired celebrations. Her sweetheart neckline pairs beautifully with delicate 3D lace, offering a soft yet structured look. For a touch of drama, a flowing cape completes the ensemble, adding an ethereal feel as you walk down the aisle or dance the night away. Functional pockets add a playful and practical twist, making her not only romantic but also modern and versatile.
