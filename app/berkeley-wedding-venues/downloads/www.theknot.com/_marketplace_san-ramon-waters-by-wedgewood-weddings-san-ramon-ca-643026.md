From day 1, the ladies at Wedgewood Waters San Ramon were amazing! They really listened to what we wanted for our vision and provided an amazing planning binder for all the vendors...

that are included in our package. They offer a variety of packages that fit any budget but we went all in for their Elite Package. The payment plan was perfect and they were supper accommodating. Day of our wedding (late March), what wedding wouldn't have a mini crisis. One of my bridesmaids brought the wrong dress she purchased. Our day of coordinator offered to drive and go to her home to retrieve the dress. Luckily, she fit the dress and looked fabulous! The coordinator also helped finish bedazzling the bridesmaids converse that did not get finished in time. She was amazing keeping the night flowing with the timelines and keeping us informed. These ladies really go all out for the bride and groom to truly make it a stress free and care free day. Me being the bride, I was relieved I wasn't the one with the crisis lol All the vendors associated with the Elite package were amazing! The cake was the most delicious pastry I have ever had in my life and they decorated the cake beautifully with our cake topper, floral and hit the colors on the head with my inspo photo. The floral center pieces were amazing and fit perfectly with our theme, Nightmare Before Christmas and Beetlejuice. Besides the lovely ladies at this location, DJ CHRIS was AMAZING! He was amazing at our wedding really reading the crowd for the dance floor and changed up the music to keep people dancing and partying. Chris was very involved with his DJ skills, always checking in with us for certain songs for the ceremony. We made him playlists from YouTube music for our ceremony songs and processions. We made him a playlist for cocktail hour while we took photos (with API photography included vendor) and we gave him a play list of some of the songs my husband and I wanted to hear while dancing. Our photographer Andy was amazing. He was fun and upbeat and loved our idea of a Bestman first look as a joke before our real first look photos. Over all, you really get what you pay for and we are so so so happy with our experience with Wedgewood Waters San Ramon. It was and will always be the most remembered experience for my husband and I having the most stress free wedding with the most delicious foods we hand picked from their menu, our signature drinks we requested that they made us for after we said "I do". So thank you ladies for making our Jack Skellington / Beetlejuice vision come true in the most stress-free beautiful wedding our families are still talking about. (sorry the pictures will not load to show this amazing property we got married at).

e staff was not only friendly but exceptionally organized, ensuring everything ran smoothly. I was particularly thrilled to have Kaitlyn as our Day-Of Coordinator, as I had to make the difficult decision between Brentwood Rise and San Ramon Waters and was grateful to reconnect with her. Her attention to detail and thoughtful approach made all the difference, and we felt supported throughout the entire process. A special shoutout to Chris, whose professionalism and dedication were evident from the very beginning. He made sure every detail was attended to, allowing us to fully enjoy the day without concern. Additionally, we'd like to extend our thanks to the entire team—particularly the banquet captain and bar staff. They were not only efficient but also made the atmosphere fun and lively, adding an extra layer of joy to the celebration. Every member of the team contributed to the overall experience, ensuring that we felt cherished and cared for. Our wedding day would not have been the same without the hard work and kindness of everyone involved. We are truly grateful for everything and highly recommend San Ramon Waters to anyone looking for a stress-free and memorable event!

al but they made us feel like we were the only couple they were focused on. From our first meeting up to our last dance, we stayed calm & reassured that everything would be all that we imagined. We felt heard in our request and were fulfilled beyond what we imagined. The coordination was extremely important to us to make sure there was not a stone left unturned. The scheduled check in's made it easy to keep track of the things we needed to do and all the things they were taking care of, All the outside vendors were amazing as well, listening to every detail to see the details we requested through our eyes. All the food, flowers, photographers & especially the music is still being discussed by our friends & family. We loved the venue and were so excited to see how all the photo's turned out. From the alter to the reception hall and the couple's photo's under the weeping willow tree at sunset was exquisite. Thank you to all the staff for making our Wedding Day so special and a day we will treasure forever,

re such thing as a perfect wedding? Because that's what we felt we had and it's all thanks to the staff at this venue. From the day we toured the venue through our wedding day, they were there for us. Any questions we had, we emailed them, and they would respond within MINUTES sometimes. Their responsiveness and communication was top notch and made planning a breeze. Their wedding planner binder had every detail we could think of, and the to-do timeline recommendations helped keep us on track throughout. We used all of their recommended vendors besides the photographer, and it was just so easy. We're still in shock about how stress-free the planning process was because of their team. Fast forward to the actual wedding day - it flowed seamlessly. The food was AMAZING. The drinks were flowing even though our families kept them running around with all those shots 🤣 We just felt supported from start to finish and can't say enough about them! They went above and beyond. The little things they did helped make the day even more special - they kept asking us if we needed anything. When we sat down at our table, they had a cute photo printed out that they sneaked during our bridal party photo session. They packed us two plates of the dinner meal to take home. We can go on and on! And we haven't even mentioned how BEAUTIFUL the actual venue was. It was a dream and we are so grateful for how they made our dream come to life.

ep and communicated with us in a timely manner. I loved how we can just simply text them for any quick question without having to call & leaving a vmail. Chris, DJ, tried to be patient and flexible for any last minute changes as well as create a very fun atmosphere-- kudos to him! I would recommend him. Overall, it was a great vendor and experience with them. From the customer service to food, it was excellent. One thing to comment is the outside of the venue, the gray fences looks outdated and the black fences in the parking lot looks rusty.

Okay I am way late to get this review written up as our wedding was in November of 2022 so let me get started. I cannot say enough great things about this venue and the folks that ...

run it. We met with three different Wedgewood teams and knew IMMEDIATELY that San Ramon was the one for us. My husband and I thought the venue was perfect and the staff was so friendly and willing to put up with our goofiness. We had an opportunity to interact with just about everyone on the team, but Sabrena was our coordinator for the day-of. We loved the flexibility of being able to build our own package and ended up using several of the vendors offered through Wedgewood. We included the DJ, the baker and the drapery artist in our big day. The team was so kind and offered us a couple free upgrades like gorgeous mahogany chairs and the hexagonal arch behind our sweetheart table. OH! Wedgewood also gifted us a second sparkler moment as we donated our donut wall! They were incredibly patient while we sorted our way through all of our decisions and so knowledgeable when we couldn't decide on something! They also had several things that we were able to borrow which made it super convenient! The night before, we were able to have our ceremony walk-through which was quick and easy. Wedgewood was kind enough to let us stick around for a few hours since we were the last group for the day. Sabrena gave us the opportunity to get almost everything decorated which hopefully made things a bit easier for them the next day! Upon our arrival, the team was quick to make sure ourselves and the boys were separated. The bridal suite was stocked up with goodies and all of our florals from our vendor had been placed inside. The wedding was perfect! Even three months later, we still have family and friends raving about how it was "one of the best weddings they have ever been to!" The food was so freaking DELICIOUS and the drinks were hittin'! LMAO! We are so incredibly grateful to the team that made our night so special. As I mentioned, Sabrena was our day-of coordinator but the rest of the ladies were there to cheer us on, as well! A huge shout-out to our team Johnny and Cary (banquet captains), Nathan and Gavin (servers), Marcello and Albert (chefs), Jeff (bartender), and of course our girl Sabrena! Working with this group really makes me wish I could get married all over again. It truly was the best day of our lives and we are so grateful to the wonderful people that made it happen. Thank you again from the bottom of our hearts you guys, we love you so much! :)

If you're on the fence about which venue to go with for your wedding, ponder no further. Go with Wedgewood. Choosing WW was 100% the best decision we made out of the ENTIRE plannin...

g process. We booked our wedding date with WW 3 months before the pandemic hit. COVID changed everything. From headcount, to event execution, to whether or not we'd even be able to have a wedding at all; Suddenly everything on our checklist became a variable. All of a sudden, we were watching COVID color tiers on a daily basis to see how many guests we would actually be allowed to safely invite. Planning a wedding with a fluctuating guest list is intense, to say the least (all amid a much larger Van Gogh-style masterpiece of a year brimming with true chaos; featuring a nail biting election, record breaking wildfires, and of course a deadly global pandemic). Again, out of ALL the decisions we had to make, working with WW was irrefutably the best one. Every week, something inspired one of us to say, “I'm so glad we picked WW”. Reliability, affordability, and most of all, compassion. The WW team knocks it out of the park in all aspects of planning AND hosting a wedding (shout out to Mandy, Sabrena, and Hayley) for their exceptional work). No matter how things were changing, we always felt like WW had our back. They didn't use cliches like “we've got you covered”, but the quality of their service naturally brought that cheesy slogan to the forefront of our minds, and boy is it a relief to know that your wedding venue is reliable and accountable. When we met with the WW team, it was immediately apparent that they're more than just catchy marketing slogans on paper; they're the real deal. The experts with all the know-how and the pros at planning out every detail. For this level of service, WW offers the best value EVER. We were on a budget. The WW team never pressured us into any services we couldn't afford, and more importantly, never made us feel bad about being on a budget (they even provided input on ways to save money). They were warm and understanding every step of the way. And rest assured, the quality of their service does not waver with your budget. They care, no matter what your budget is. That's what ties it all together. They care. They have compassion. You're not just a contract. When we care about something or someone, we naturally strive to achieve the best results and to bring joy and satisfaction. That's WW right there. I work as a project manager for a living, partnering with 30+ vendors at a time everyday. As a compulsive planner, I'd like to tell all of my fellow planners out there that WW does not disappoint. They overlook nothing in the planning process. And when things inevitably go a little off course on the big day; relax. The WW team already knows about it and has already made tweaks so that the rest of the day goes smoothly. They will always do their best for you (sometimes even things you don't ask for, just because they know it'll make your day better). Even the vendors they partner with, from the DJ (DJ Grammer is remarkable by the way), to the bakery, to every single one of the serving staff that night (guests relayed that the staff were very friendly and helpful) work with the same compassion. They all care. It's pretty damn spectacular. Thank you so much, WW!! TL;DR The Wedgewood team is damn amazing. Choosing WW is the only guaranteed grand slam decision you might make in the entire planning process.

Wedgewood is definitely the most "user-friendly" way to create a beautiful wedding. I was not a pinterest bride, nor did I have much knowledge of where to even start, but our proc...

ess with Wedgewood SR was zero stress on us and our budget. They let us pick and chose what we wanted and worked with us to make our wedding exactly what we wanted. All our meetings took place at the venue, aside from cake and flowers, but they were in very close proximity. Their cake, flower, and JD vendors were all very sweet. They made us feel welcomed, special, and we had a great wedding. Day of was perfect weather and the team worked so well to make sure everything was organized and fun. Weddings can be stressful and expensive, but choosing Wedgewood is a great way to ease your stress on the whole process and on your wallet. Highly recommend!

Overall, we were really pleased with Wedgewood Weddings. Having an all-inclusive venue really relieves a lot of stress. Our wedding appointments all went well, and we were thrilled...

we were able to book a holiday weekend on a Sun for Sun prices. The day of our wedding the set up of everything was beautiful. For the price, you really can't beat it. We spent about $18K for 117 guests; this includes everything (food/drinks, coordinator, set up, DJ, cake/cake cutting, etc.) except for the photographer and florist, since we decided to go with our own photographer/florist. There were only a few hiccups, all very minor, and we attribute it to the fact that Wedgewood is essentially a wedding machine. If you're not overly picky about details though, I think Wedgewood is still very much worth the price. The hiccups that occurred were actually mostly related to the DJ so I would recommend being really clear with every detail with the DJ you're assigned (although I felt I was pretty clear with him, you just never know). It was apparent there was minimal sound check the day of because as soon as I walked down the aisle (it was an outdoor ceremony), I realized you could hardly hear the music. I was a bit bummed about this as I really feel the music sets the tone of the ceremony. Then there was a mic issue where our officiant was given a lapel mic but no other mic for me and my husband to talk into (our officiant just ended up taking off his lapel mic and holding it up to our mouths). There were also several times I had to remind the DJ about details I had already told him (i.e. when we were doing our thank you speech and a reminder to guests that they could take home the centerpieces). None of these hiccups were big enough to ruin the night by any means, but felt it was worth noting. Overall, my husband and I are still incredibly satisfied with how our wedding turned out, truly an unforgettable day! I would highly recommend Wedgewood Weddings San Ramon, as long as you know going in there could potentially be minor mishaps and you're not overly picky about all the details.

We recently had our wedding here and it was amazing! You should look no further than Wedgewood Weddings San Ramon. The staff here are exceptional and really do care about each coup...

le they work with. 1\. Staff: I had the pleasure of working with Mandy and Ivonne for the planning process and these women are just amazing! They work hard to solve any issues that may come up and genuinely do their best to make the experience as easy and enjoyable as possible. I could not thank them enough for such a wonderful experience. My day of coordinator Selena and banquet manager, Ashley were also top notch. Selena was so helpful on the day of to make sure everything was set up as I envisioned. They were checking in with me through out the night to make sure everything ran smoothly and that I had everything I needed. 2\. Wedding Cake and Desserts: Old Town Bakery hands down did an amazing job. Our cake was almost too beautiful to cut and was super moist. They also did some desserts for us and everyone of guests were raving about how great they were. I would go back to them for future events in a heart beat. My only regret was not asking for the cake to get wrapped up after it was passed out so that my family could have taken it home as by the end of the night since we were staying at a hotel, we could not keep the cake. 3\. Dublin Floral: Overall the flowers were nice for our centerpieces that were included in our package. 4\. DJ Martin: DJ Martin was great. He checked in with us a couple days before the wedding to really get to know us a bit and what we wanted for the day of. He was great at keeping with our timeline and giving us prompts. He also was really flexible and easy to work with when we ran a little behind on some of the speeches. 5\. Food: I was a little nervous that we did not get to do a tasting of the food beforehand but OMG did they impress me and my guest. The appetizers were yummy but the star was the duet plate of baked salmon and mini filet mignon . The salmon was incredible moist and flavorful. I am still at awe how they got each filet mignon to be perfectly cooked at a medium rare for all my guest. It is definitely one of the better wedding dinners I have had and all my guest agreed. Overall we were so glad we went with Wedgewood Weddings! Their all inclusive package is a great deal and they really do not skip on the service. Of all the venues I visited before choosing Wedgewood, I do not think any of them could have delivered in terms of excellent service they provided. If you are looking for a wedding venue, look no further than Wedgewood Weddings San Ramon! It would be hard to get the value and level of service elsewhere.

ll inclusive packages and you also are able to customize to fit your needs/wants. 1\. Wedgewood Staff. We worked with Mandy, Ivonne and Sarah. All three are so pleasant to work with. They made planning our wedding easy and stress free. 2\. Wedding Cake. OMG! Big shout out to Old Towne Bakery! Our cake was delicious!!! Our guests couldn’t stop raving about the cake. 3\. Dj Grammer. Very pleased to have him as our Dj. He is very professional and easy to work with. He played all the songs we requested from the ceremony to the reception. He even played baby shark for our daughter at the end of the night. 4\. Dublin floral. Not impressed with the flowers. I’m just going to leave it at that. Definitely did not meet my expectations. 5\. Food. Appetizers were good. My favorite is the fried Mac n cheese! Yum!! For dinner, we had prime rib, tortellini, and parmesan crusted chicken as our entrees. The prime rib was very good and seasoned to perfection. But the parmesan crusted chicken was bland, tough and dry. I didn’t really care for it. Overall, pleased with the food except for the chicken entree. We are so glad we chose Wedgewood for our wedding day. My husband and I received so many compliments on how beautiful our wedding was. Thank you Wedgewood for making our day very memorable and special!!!

First & foremost, I'd just like to say how incredibly happy everyone was at our wedding. (Including the Bride & Groom, of course! :] ) This venue was the very 1st venue my Husband ...

& I saw, and we just fell in love! We wanted this so bad, so we reserved this venue in 11/2017! (Our wedding was on April 27, 2019 - we were totally ahead of the game) Everyone who worked in the Sales Office was so kind & helpful. Melodye was amazing! She was the first person we ever had contact w/, she made us feel very comfortable as well. She always made sure we understood what was included within our package and explained everything to us so clearly! Whenever we had any follow up calls/appointments, she always made sure everything was in order. On the day of our wedding, our Coordinator Olivia was just the best! (She also did our wedding rehearsal, everything was so fast & easy!) If it wasn't for her, I would've been so stressed out. Olivia made us all feel at ease & always made sure everyone was okay. What caught me by surprise, was that Olivia took pictures of the wedding party & printed them out and put them into frames & gave them to us as gifts. I loved that so much! Brandon and I can't thank the Wedgewood - San Ramon team enough for making our wedding day so perfect & special! Everyone had the best time! :) -Wedgewood Team were very fast at replying to us whenever we had questions via email/phone call -The venue has a ton of space -The pricing was very moderate, they would accommodate to your budget -Their DJ vendor was great -Bridal Suite is very spacious -The food is very delicious & have tons of options -To be honest, the list can go on & on...Wedgewood San Ramon is the best venue to have your wedding ceremony/reception at!

xactly to our liking. Our guests loved the location, and many of them said it was the (or one of the) best weddings they had even been to. I really liked working with Sarah W. She was sweet, and personable, and helped everything run very smoothly. The only complaint i have, which wasnt per se a Wedgewood problem, was our wedding cake, which was made by they bakery vendor Wedgewood Works with, came out incredibly unprofessionally made, and unappealing looking. Definitely did not look like any of the inspiration pictures i brought it to her. I really liked the woman, but if you use Danville bakery, just go with a very VERY simple design. After the wedding, Wedgewood made that wrong, right for us, which we thought was so great of them.

t just that at The Wedgewood San Ramon! During the planning process with Olivia, Sarah, and Mandy I couldn’t have asked for a more professional, organized, nice group! We did the elite package and the vendors we used were amazing! Dublin Florals, Old Town Danville Bakery, and Pearlsia Decor made our wedding look so romantic and beautiful! You also have to ask for DJ Grammer for your wedding! He was so fun and kept the whole night going! We got married in July 2019 in the evening. We are so glad we did! We had the most beautiful sunset setting at the ceremony! My friends and family still talk about our wedding. They said it was one of the most beautiful and fun weddings that they have been to. Congrats if you just got engaged and are searching for that perfect place to get married! I highly recommend The Wedgwood San Ramon venue. You will be in good hands every step of the way!

When we came the first time to see the venue, Olivia showed us around & made sure to stay in touch with us after. Overall, this is the place to get married at. I was stressed out but that was all on me. Mandy & the rest of the staff made sure this wedding was stress free the day of & let me tell you, they succeeded in that.

cious, the venue was beautiful especially with the new arbor and more intimate, fenced-in ceremony site! Our week was almost three weeks ago and people are STILL talking about how beautiful the venue was, how smoothly everything went, and how delicious the food was. Mandy, Sarah, and the rest of the Wedgewood team were fabulous, detail-oriented, and sweet - by the end of the wedding process the team became my best friends. They worked with my husband and I to incorporate things that were important to us as a couple - like having our dog walk down the aisle in a gold dress. So grateful for the beautiful wedding we had here with Wedgewood and would recommend it to anyone getting married or having a big event.

We first met with Devin, she showed us the venue and the breakdown of our package. Melodye did an awesome job at our phone appointment, details appointment and our final appointment. She made sure our wedding vision came to life with such ease. We couldn't do it without her as she was there every step of the way. Heather did a wonderful job as our rehearsal/day of coordinator. I must admit it was a challenge because we had a super big entourage. She made sure we were doing fine and always made sure she was there if we needed anything. Lastly, after Heather left for the night, Kyle and his team, always checked in with us and made sure everything was perfect and that he was around if we needed him. The entire Wedgewood team was great. We can't thank you enough for the time, patience, help with planning and the execution of our wedding. We love you guys!!!

She went above and beyond making sure I felt totally comfortable with everything. We need to emphasize how much we loved Devin. She was our Event Coordinator on the day of the wedding. I’m sure all brides get a little nervous, but her amazing demeanor kept all of us calm and relaxed. She was supportive and warm and went out of her way to make sure our wedding was better than we could have ever dreamed. She should be commended and recognized for her outstanding work. Wedgewood should be proud to have such an amazing coordinator. While we really liked all of your employees, Devin is a perfect exemplar for all of Wedgewood. As far as the location, people raved about the beauty of Wedgewood San Ramon. It really couldn’t have been a better place for our wedding.

My husband Michael and I got married on June 17, 2018 and I cannot stop raving about the staff there! Everyone who attended my wedding even complimented how nice everyone was and how beautiful the venue is. Pro tips: get the meatballs, bacon wrapped scallops, ahi tuna wontons and for your main entree, the BEEF BURGUNDY!!! (it looks weird, but trust, it is SO good!) We actually toured two other Wedgewood venues before picking this one and honestly, its one of the prettier/well laid out venues. (The HUGE bridal suite and separate cocktail hour room is what sold us for sure.) The only downfall is all the duck poop and ants, but then again, you are on a golf course so it comes with the territory. ;-) Shoutout to Melodye, Devin, Lauren, Roxanne, Kristen (love you ladies) and Kyle for making our day such a dream!!!

mail through the end of the wedding, the entire team at Wedgewood San Ramon were kind, courteous and helpful at every stage of the planning process. While my husband and I were looking at venues in San Ramon, we came across Wedgewood's website. After seeing the great reviews, beautiful photos and available packages, we knew right away we would be going with Wedgewood! We toured several other locations, but Wedgewood had everything we were looking for and fit our particular style. I am currently in my finals stages of law school and am working full time, which left very little "extra" time to devote to planning. Wedgewood's inclusive packages and devoted staff take a lot of the chaos involved in planning a wedding, making it easy for me to focus on all of the positive and happy aspects of planning! Roxanne, Paige, Nicole and Kristi in the Wedgewood catering office were always quick to respond to any question I ever had via phone, email or in person. While we know that creating a great wedding experience is their job, we felt that each person involved was sincerely happy for us and excited about our event. We never once felt like "just another couple", but instead we always received personalized attention and assistance anytime we needed it. The vendors included in our package could not have been more wonderful! Our cake, flowers, music exceeded our expectations! Karen made us a delicious cake, Donna created a gorgeous variety of floral decorations, Noel put up a fun photo booth, and Chris made sure everyone had a great time with music and dancing! Kyle and Nicole made sure the day ran smoothly from the minute we arrived to the final cleanup at the end of the evening. The food was delicious and the hosted bar was a big hit with the guests! I highly recommend Wedgewood San Ramon to any bride and groom looking for a stress-free wedding planning process. They will make your lives easier, so that you can truly enjoy your entire wedding experience from beginning to end. Thank you Roxanne, Nicole, Paige, Kristi, Kyle and everyone else at Wedgewood for making our wedding day PERFECT!

I wish we could have since we barely got to eat and I was really looking forward to the dishes that we chose.Overall, great! I would choose them all over again!

For a wedding in June, this venue offers a beautiful outdoor ceremony, low rise bar/lounge area, and a wedding hall that could comfortably seat about 230. Pros: Like other We...

dgewood venues, San Ramon offers packages that can be easily customized for a good value. They have their preferred vendors, but gladly allow you to use your own outside vendors and will give you a credit toward your package. For example, we decided to go with our own florist, cake baker, wedding invitations, and hotel accommodations that fit more of our personal preference. They said "no problem" with a smile and we received a credit for each. The sales representatives are friendly, easy to work with, and respond very promptly via phone or email to any questions that my pop up when wedding planning. Additionally, the sales representatives will give you reminders as deadlines approach such as payment installment due dates, when the music playlist is due, details meeting, etc. We were very aware of our deadlines, and it was good to know they also were, too. They also made it very easy for a busy professional that could not make it in person for the weekday final details meeting or to make payments in person. I had the option of calling and emailing them, which definitely was more confident. Cons: Overall we were very satisfied of the outcome of our big day. It went very smoothly; however, these are specific events/items to consider: You are required to use their catering service. If you are a Foodie, the food was about average (we went with the plated filet mignon and salmon bearnadaise). Filet mignon was cooked to our liking medium-rare, tender and juicy, but the salmon was so-so. The catering staff was at times not on their best customer service game, most specifically at the wedding set up. We are still unsure, but they may have been stressed from turning over from the event before. Poor attention to detail on behalf of the catering staff. I had spent hours working on my final details for Wedgewood and specifically requested for the top tier of the cake to be cut and our left over sheet cake in the back to be saved for the bride and groom. Our cake baker also reminded the banquet staff. At the end of the night, the sheet cake was all served and we took home an untouched top tier of our cake. I had also reorganized the evening itinerary to allow for plenty of time to cut and serve the cake to our wedding guests. It took about 20-30 minutes to finally get the cake out to the reception hall. A considerable amount of time considering that half of the cake (sheetcake) had been in sitting in the kitchen and could have been pre-cut. Many of our guests ended up leaving before eating the cake as it was already getting close to 10pm. Overall, this wedding venue was easy to work with, allowed us to have a surprisingly unstressful wedding planning experience, and as the Bride and Groom we had a great time and were very satisfied with the final outcome. The comments we mostly received from our guests is that they had a lot of fun, it was a beautiful wedding, and the venue was nice. We would recommend this venue to others who are looking for a venue which is easy to work with and at a good value.

Wedgewood was my second choice to get married. I LOVED the bridal room with floor to ceiling mirror and large space to get ready. Also liked the wood bar for cocktail hour and vi...

ews. Did not like the goose poop or closeness of ceremony site to golfers. Was also a bit pricy for the amount of guests and options we wanted. Everyone was very helpful and gracious.

Wedgewood staff were wonderful throughout the wedding process, from the initial day I met with them for a quote and all the way to my wedding day. I did a lot of price comparison w...

ith other venues and compared packages. Wedgewood provided the best value overall - they included so many items/details in their package that other vendors did not provide. Many of my guests commented that the ceremony location, the food and service were very good and wonderful, and how beautiful the flowers and setting of the wedding. They truly did a GREAT job. My youngest sister said that if she was to get married, she plans to use Wedgewood Banquet for her wedding. Highly recommend and would use them again for any large functions and events!

I dont know who thought that they don't do outdoor ceremonies but i just had one in august outside and I am SO happy my husband and I found this place and got married here. Plannin...

g our wedding was much less stressful because Wedgewood is all inclusive. We only had to book a photographer and personal florist separately, which they give you local vendor recommendations of people they go through often. The food was great and so was the service. The ceremony site was breathtaking and the reception was gorgeous!!!! I highly recommend the lighting package. Make sure you communicate with your banquet captain before the wedding if you were a type of bride like me, who didn't want to be contacted with any decisions or bothered during the ceremony/reception. I thought I made it clear but ended up being stressed a little from being asked questions and such. The time FLIES during reception and ceremony so my advice is to LOOK AROUND! I forgot to take in all the small things and was surprised when I saw them in pictures. Like table set up, favors laid out, centerpieces and so on. I also highly advise a videographer...we didn't get around to booking one and I feel like we missed out... Now I will never see my own ceremony, first dance, father daughter dance...etc. and I would have loved to see it all in REAL time instead of just while it was there because it literally flew by. It was over before I knew it. Wedgewood is amazing and in 30 years or so when we Renew our vows, we wanna do it here!!!!!

I love Wedgewood in San Ramon. Their whole sales and banquet staff were amazing. They are affordable and as someone who works more than full time it was super convenient. They do...

all the work and you sit back and enjoy the best day of your life. They work with amazing vendors with high standards. I am a perfectionist by nature and it was really hard letting go of the reigns and trusting my wedding in the hands of strangers. Wedgewood lets you have a say in all the important things and manages to take care of everything else better than you could yourself because they do it all the time.

where!). The food was amazing, music was awesome (everyone danced all night long), the drinks kept coming (open bar highly recommended), so much fun that we extended the party by an hour at the end of the night! The venue itself photographs very well, so look beyond somethings in person, because the pictures came out gorgeous!
