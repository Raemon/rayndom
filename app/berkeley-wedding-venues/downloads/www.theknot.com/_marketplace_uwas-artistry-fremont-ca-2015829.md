for. She incorporated the feedback I had between my trial and my actual wedding (I do recommend booking a trial!). The 'touch up' kit she provides was helpful, as it included some general items such as bobby and safety pins. These both came in very handy at a separate wedding event I had days later. I would book with Uwa again for future events! Tip: She gets a ton of texts and you may not hear back same-day. She encourages clients to reach out again if she is not responsive within a reasonable amount time.

Needless to say, I was so happy with how everything turned out and felt so beautiful and confident on my big day in Carmel, CA. Not only did she do my bridal hair and makeup, but she also did makeup for my four bridesmaids and her partner did their hair. They made all of my bridesmaids look like supermodels and tailored each glam look based on their inspo requests - ranging from full to soft glam, Anne can do it all! My sister loved Anne so much and has already used her makeup services for her engagement photos! Throughout my entire wedding day and night, I received sooo many compliments about how good my make up looked! Not to mention, my glam photographed perfectly, which is a huge deal for brides since these photos last a lifetime! If you want a smooth, positive, and flawless wedding glam experience, look no further than Anne!

I stumbled upon Uwa’s artistry instagram and saw that she was experienced and was very diverse with her clientele. On my makeup trial it felt very collaborative in a sense that she...

was also helping me figure out what I liked, what I didn’t like and what looked good/didn’t. I’ve been to makeup trials before where the artist expects you to know what you want but I’m sorry, most of us only have ideas and not specifics. So this method helped loads bc I’m not well versed in makeup as much as I thought I was. She also gave me so many suggestions on how to prep my skin and take care of my skin in the months leading to my wedding bc my skin was dryer than the Saharan desert on my trial day. Truly. She recommended great products and skin treatments that I should invest in and let me tell you, on my wedding day, my makeup was not cakey at all and stayed the whole night. So not only did I look good, I felt good too. I would definitely recommend Uwa’s artistry to anyone looking for a patient, personable and professional artist that actually listens to help and create a look WITH you. She also serviced 10 bridesmaids and 2 family members, hair and/or makeup. Everyone was happy and no stress the morning of the wedding, Thank God! Thanks again! 5 stars well deserved!!!

I had a destination wedding in San Francisco and as most brides I was in need of a makeup and hair stylist. I was nervous about hiring someone who I wasn’t familiar with for my big...

day. I searched for a makeup artist and hairstylist using various apps and sites. I specifically wanted someone who was familiar with dark skin tones. I came across Anne’s profile on the The Knot. I was impressed by her work, both on her website and Instagram page. Anne was professional, communicative and talented. I wasn’t able to complete a trial hair and makeup, so I relied on explaining my desires through emails and pictures to Anne. On the day of, Anne arrived on time. She was able to complete my makeup and 2 bridal makeup’s before our estimated time, indicated on our wedding timeline. I couldn’t have been happier with her work. She nailed every one of my request and had me and the bridal party looking exceptionally beautiful. The makeup lasted all day and night and showed up well in all my photos. Her expertise and experience really did make the whole process flawless. You can’t go wrong with hiring Anne for any occasion.

I don't wear make up in my daily life so while it is a shock to see yourself with a full face of make up, Ann really listened to what I was comfortable with and I am so grateful to have trusted her, I felt like myself and the pictures came out gorgeous. She also brought a team of other hair and make up artists to work on my family and friends, and their looks also came out incredible. Everyone felt like a queen! Ann has the most calm, kind and patient energy. On a day when things can be hectic, I look back fondly on the time I spent with her just being grounded and enjoying some quiet time. She even helped me button my wedding dress :) I can't recommend working with Ann enough, it was a highlight!

I absolutely LOVED my hair/makeup and it lasted throughout the day/night (12+ hours later and an outfit change). Thank you Anne for making me feel beautiful! And thank you to her assistant, Sheryl, for doing gorgeous makeup for my mom, mother-in-law, and sister! We received so many compliments on our makeup, you ladies are the real deal.

If I could I would keep her all to myself, but I’m not rich like the Kardashians 🤣!!! I was a bridesmaid when I first met Ann and we connected right away! I knew at that moment ...

she would do my make up for my wedding. 1 year later I’m getting married! Ann was there to beautify me for my SF City Hall Court Marriage and Mehndi ceremony. Both ceremonies she did hair and make up. I felt like a princess, it was flawless! ❤️ Ann is versatile and being that I’m half Black, half Punjabi she was able to incorporate both looks! I’m already figuring out what other events I have to plan so she can do my make up again. She is my Glam Fam! Even my friends are now also looking forward to using her after seeing my makeup and hair! I can’t thank her enough for making my days special! Thank you Ann! 😘

If you're at all looking for a makeup artist for your wedding day, stop what you're doing and book Uwasartistry! Anne fit me in at a time where she was already EXCEPTIONALLY busy! ...

I really wanted to book her because I followed her instagram and loved her work. Although she already had an appointment on my wedding day she checked her schedule and made the time and room necessary to book my date. We set up a trial and she was so down to earth. The trial makeup was beautiful but I wasn't sure it would match my dress. I changed my mind and was able to email my Anne my thoughts and considerations even after I had left. On the wedding day everything was perfect. I was in love with my makeup and was so glad that I had booked an artist that allowed to actually voice what I wanted and listened. I got compliments all day, I didn't want to take it off! Thank you so much again Anne, if I ever need to be done up again, I'll book in a heartbeat <3

She was on time and ready to get down to business. My floral hairpiece was a bit larger than either of us had expected. We discussed how to handle it and the end result was stunning! I looked at myself and felt so confident to walk down that aisle marry the woman of my dreams. My fiancé was speechless when we did our first look. The day was perfection! I will definitely reach out to UWA again for a special event. I sort of wanted to have my wedding again just so that Anne could glam me up again! The best! 5 stars ⭐️!

w - the end result was amazing! I looked beautiful AND still looked like myself! All of my ladies were so happy with their looks (our teenage flower girl couldn’t stop checking herself out in the mirror lol). Anne is great at communication - very timely responses. Thank you thank you!! A funny story to show just how awesome Anne is - during my hair/makeup trial, I had one of my random dizzy spells. Anne was the picture of perfect professionalism - she calmly got me ice and water, and told stories that made me feel so much better (I was mortified). This is what you want in the artist for your big day - someone who will not just make you look amazing, but someone who is kind, and a pro at handling nerves & jitters. I will be coming back to Anne for all of my event hair & makeup from now on!!

s that brides endure planning a wedding. My wedding was during COVID-19 and Anne graciously stuck by my side through the challenging planning process. She is just incredible. She gave me a sense of calm with planning and she turned out to be someone I could really count on and TRUST. She also relaxed my nerves on my big day with the special things she did for me. If you are wanting the best makeup makeover of your life you must work with this QUEEN. She will make you feel royal. "Beauty is in the way you hold yourself. It's how you treat people. The way you love. It's self-acceptance. Beauty is in your soul...and in a great makeup artist!"

ously stalked Anne's IG to check out the work she'd been doing on other brides. I really wanted to go with someone who knows and has worked with darker skin tones. Anne was an absolute dream and I couldn't be happier. She was super reasonable, on time, and efficient. She was kind and accommodating, too. Because my wedding was during the pandemic I risked not having a trial run to limit exposure but the final look was amazing. I would also like to note that Anne's assistant was also very sweet and did my moms hair and makeup and my mom loved her HMU. I would definitely recommend Anne to any bride- you will not be disappointed!

emic, tensions are high; Anne was cool, calm and collected with proper COVID-19 safety equipment. We were unable to do a hair and makeup trial beforehand which usually causes added stress however Anne was responsive the day of the wedding and worked collaboratively to give me my dream look! The wedding day also brought rain and high winds, of which I was incredibly pleased that the make up application (especially the falsh eyelashes!) and hair stayed perfectly throughout the stormy day. Anne is wonderful and a true talent! I cannot sing her praises enough!

kin type. I felt like a true princess on my wedding day. My hair typically doesn’t hold curls well, but my hair style lasted all night long. I didn’t want to take my makeup off at the end because it was so beautiful. I received so many compliments on my wedding day. It was the perfect balance between bridal glam and natural. I didn’t want to look like someone else since I don’t wear heavy makeup on a regular basis. I will definitely be calling up Anne again for future events! Thanks Anne, you’re the best!!

any more beautiful than that, and still somehow managed to look 10x better on the wedding day (must be that wedding glow!). Both my hair and makeup were masterpieces and I was so sad to take it all apart at the end of the night, which is a big deal for me, because I usually don't like wearing makeup. She gave me that beautiful, magazine-worthy bride look without making me feel like I had a mask of makeup on. Do yourself a favor and go with Anne for your special day!
