Sebastian was absolutely incredible as a guitarist for our wedding day. We had a small (~60-person) wedding ceremony in an outdoor garden and asked Sebastian to #1 play intro music...

as guests arrived, #2 play custom processional and recessional songs, and #3 play music after the ceremony during post-ceremony cocktails/mingling. Sebastian was phenomenal in every regard, and we would highly recommend him for another wedding. Before the wedding, Sebastian was responsive, kind, and communicative -- he took the time to hear our plan for the wedding, and we chosen custom processional and recessional songs (that he learned flawlessly). At the ceremony, his solo guitar was phenomenal (to experience as both a couple getting married and per reviews from our guests). We felt so lucky that Sebastian was our guitarist on our special wedding day and would be delightfully recommend him to others!

We chose Canon in D, Can’t Help Falling in Love, and Just the Two of Us for the ceremony, and he carried that same beautiful energy seamlessly into our 2-hour cocktail hour. It was so helpful that Sebastian curated the rest of the music based on the songs we provided—it was the perfect acoustic guitar style we were looking for: balanced, beautiful, and never cheesy or overdone. If you're looking for an incredibly talented, professional, and thoughtful musician, I couldn’t recommend Sebastian more. He truly made our day unforgettable!
