I cannot recommend Alexandria enough. Pickings a photographer is probably one of the more important choices. You can’t go wrong with Alex. Being a little camera shy, I was really n...

ervous about the photographs. Alex instantly put me at ease, making me feel like I was beautiful and helping me feel confident in front of the camera. She was the perfect amount of obtrusive as well—she made sure we got certain shots but let a lot of things just happen organically. I was honored to have her shoot our wedding and very much recommend you use her as well!!

Alex captured my wedding day and I have nothing but great things to say about her. I'm not someone who typically loves being photographed but Alex made the whole process natural an...

d fun. I was so grateful for her positive, laid-back attitude and impressed by the fact that even though she seemed calm, she got all the shots I could have wanted and more. Within just a few days of getting married, Alex provided my husband and I with a bunch of sneak previews and they came out amazing! It was exactly the mix of portraits and candid shots I was looking for. Leading up to my wedding day she was incredibly responsive and always made time for a call / answered emails quickly when I had a question. If you are looking for someone with impeccable style who will take the time to understand what you want and make the process enjoyable, Alex is the photographer for you!

Alex was the first person I hired after we booked our venue - truthfully, I reached out to her before we had even gotten engaged because I had been obsessed with her photography fo...

r so long that I know I needed her to photograph our wedding. Throughout our planning process, Alex was there for us every step of the way. To answer any of my type-A bride timeline questions to helping us coordinate the best way to do family photos, she was always there for us! She is SO organized and had the most helpful questionnaire about what kind of photos we wanted, what family pairings, etc. which really helped us figure out what photos were priorities for us. Day off, I couldn’t have asked for any other vendor to essentially be by our side for the entire day. She kept all of our energy up all day, wrangled 6 groomsmen, and coordinated family photos like it was nothing! My husband and I don’t love posing for photos which fit perfectly with Alex’s style of photography, she encouraged us to do things that felt natural to us and we were so comfortable with her the whole time. She was our hype girl all day and night and was flexible with us when we wanted to spend more time at cocktail hour rather than taking golden hour photos. We got out sneak peaks back SO quickly and the photos are STUNNING. I expected 10-15 photos to be delivered so I could post on Instagram, but she delivered OVER 100 photos just for our sneak peaks. Every photo’s editing is phenomenal and complimented our venue and our color palette and the composition of the photos are breathtaking. We are so excited to get our full gallery back in a few months and that through her photography, we will be able to relive our day over and over again.

Alex was absolutely phenomenal and our ROCK throughout the whole process. Not only is she an exceptional photographer (her craft and vision is insane truly!) but her organization, ...

attention to detail and helping hand along the way to the wedding was our guiding light. She made me and my partner feel so safe, comfy and loved throughout the process and the day of, she really felt like an old friend who was just there celebrating with us. Can not recommend her more highly, she will take away so much of your stress and allow you to live in the moment knowing you're in great hands. Throughout the whole process we couldn't stop saying THANK GOD WE HAVE ALEX!!!! Stop looking and hire her now!

No matter what I say here, the words really can't describe how amazing Alex is. From our first initial phone chat until the end of our wedding night, Alex made our entire wedding ...

so special. She is so clever, talented and not of course, professional. She made us feel comfortable and we trusted her entirely to capture our big day. Truly I can't think of a better person to capture the wedding. We just received our sneak peeks and they're more than I could have even imagined. She perfectly captured the vibe of the entire day, start to finish. Her talent is unmatched and you'd be remiss not to hire her. She is the best of the best and cannot recommend her enough. Thank you Alex for making the day such a dream!

my fiance and I were going for. We were nervous to take professional photos, and Alex made me feel super comfortable and relaxed throughout the entire process. She delivered a handful of photos a few days after the shoot to give us a sneak peak, which we really appreciated, and delivered the entire gallery shortly after. We are truly blown away. Her photography is 100%, hands-down worth the investment and we are so thrilled with our photos.

early shines through as her expertise removed any stress that we would have had. The peace of mind along with truly being able to enjoy our special day is something that so few can do. She's amazing to work with, families love her, we love her, our friends love her and she's so willing to be able to adapt it all different types of styles and really discovers what matters to us. She truly captures how the event felt and these are precious memories that will stand against the test of time. Thank you Alexandria and to her team and if anyone gets the opportunity - don't hesitate. It is worth every investment.

moments with gorgeous photos that mean so much to me and my now husband. Also, she's extremely easy to be around and made us comfortable in front of the camera. She played music that we loved and had great ideas for what to do for our engagement shoot. It ended up feeling very "us". She was so thoughtful and supportive every step of the way. I even ended up reaching out to her for thoughts on my dress and outfit details. She had excellent advice, and I feel so lucky she was part of our dream team of wedding vendors. And I HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend her wedding albums. I am obsessed with ours. It's gorgeous, high-quality, and I can't help but smile ear to ear when I flip through it.

We could not have had a better experience with Alexandria Monette Photography. When our planner sent us a list of photographers to go through, there wasn’t a question in our mind ...

that Alex’s photos stood out to us from the start. The warmth, tone and color of her images set a mood and a feeling as though you the viewer are peering in on the special moment. The way she captured not only the bride and groom, but their guest and family members’ candid expressions and unforgettable moments in time, was inspiring and so beautiful. When we had our phone call, it was immediately a vibe. She totally got us, and made us feel at ease and excited about the process and what photography could look like on our big day. She had great communication with us every step of the way leading up to our wedding. She even worked with us to accommodate and stage special details photos of the invitations that we didn’t have time for on our actual day. As soon as we arrived at the venue she and her (amazing) second shooter were on site, and they really got us into the zone and were a calming presence amidst the nerves. Alex had a way of making everyone feel at ease while organizing specific groups and getting us some fabulous, fun and creative couples shots. Her ability to seamlessly engage with our guests while capturing the little details and then the big moments was truly impressive. Getting the photos back and looking through, we felt excited and sentimental because we truly got to see our day and relive it through the photos. Not to mention, sharing them with others so far has been a blast, because all anyone says is how obsessed they are with our photos. Thank you Alex for making our day so special and capturing our wedding in the most beautiful way!

There are a ton of wedding photographers out there, but after looking through portfolios and interviewing many in the Southern California area, we came to realize there is a big di...

fference between those who simply document the event and those who capture the moments and the vibe of the wedding. Alex is a master at capturing those moments, the ones you will be living on your wedding day thinking, “I want to bottle up this feeling for forever”. She has always exceeded our expectations. Alex is extremely professional and always pays attention to the details, which goes a long way in helping the wedding planning process and the day-of festivities go smoothly. She works with you to understand who you are as a couple and your vision for your wedding. She brings a fun and relaxed vibe to all of the photo shoots and we looked forward to every time we worked with her. We also really appreciated the timeline she created for the day-of, as this allowed us to capture all of the portraits we wanted. The day of, she really took charge and made sure we were on-schedule (very thankful for that) while still managing to capture every photo we wanted. The quality of her work blew us away when we got the photos back. Many of the wedding photos you see on Instagram all have a similar “look,” but Alex’s pop off the screen. You can tell that she is truly passionate about the couples she gets to work with, and I think this might be part of the reason why. This was even more apparent through our interactions on the wedding day with both Alex and our videographer (another company) - a stark difference between the two and I will leave it at that. In short, if we were doing it all over again, we would choose Alex for her passion, the quality of her work, her amazing personality, and her attention to the details.

Alex is amazing. We booked our wedding venue sight unseen from Canada during the pandemic. We felt confident enough to do that after falling in love with Alex's photos from a previ...

ous wedding. She was so understanding of our situation and was always quick to respond to our emails or jump on a call if needed. Her guides, expertise, experience, and organizational skills are next level. Her timeline was more detailed than our planner's and it was INCREDIBLE. Since we never had the opportunity to meet until our wedding day it could have been awkward but Alex immediately put us at ease. She seamlessly kept us on schedule, checked in with us when needed, reminded everyone to take their sunglasses off for photos (so that I didn't have to!), and went above and beyond the entire day. We really appreciated how fast we got our sneak peeks and we LOVE our photos. We cannot recommend Alex enough. Don't wait, just book with her!

he span of 2 years! She is professional, kind, thoughtful, and her photography truly speaks for itself - she is SO talented. I was so insanely picky when it came to photography, but my husband and I couldn't be happier with how the photos turned out. She captured the little moments I had completely forgotten about that made for the most special photos<3 I had spoken to her about having a super8 videographer at our wedding (it didn't end up happening) but she brought a film camera to capture a few moments throughout the day with that vintage feel...I mean!! We're so thankful to have had her guidance throughout the wedding planning process, always there to answer all + any questions we had. Thanks for everything Alex!!

I do not say this lightly but hiring Alex as our wedding photographer was the best decision we made during the planning process. Alex is the absolute best and goes so far beyond th...

e expectations of an amazing wedding photographer. From the very beginning, she was quick, efficient, and personal when responding. Once we talked to her and heard her warm, vibrant energy we knew should be a great fit. Our engagement photos turned out incredible- she captured the energy and relationship of my husband and I like we’ve never seen in photos before. It was also very fun to work with her and made us feel so comfortable. We were on a sailboat and a storm was coming in and somehow she still remained calm with us lol! She also has these extremely helpful, comprehensive guides for the engagement shoot and for the wedding. Especially if you don't have a full wedding planner or wedding designer-these are SO helpful. Now getting to the wedding day, she truly served as part photographer/part wedding coordinator. She helped keep everyone seamlessly on schedule and was my go to person with any questions or challenges of the day. My friends and family absolutely loved her and couldn't say enough great things about her after the wedding. She reads peoples’ energy super well and knew when we needed a break without even saying anything. We got our sneak peaks very quickly after the wedding and they are MAGIC. She captured all of the heartfelt moments of the day but they literally look so beautiful and straight from a magazine. Our personalities shine through in the photos and I know they will bring us back to the feelings of the day for years to come. We’re beyond grateful we hired Alex and I hope this helps convince you to do the same!

utiful setting, intimate moments, and holistic feeling of an event was exactly what I was looking for. Alex arrived right on time at our AirBnB and put a nervous group of people at ease. She and her colleague were seamless in capturing the preparation photos and were there for every special moment. I loved the pictures she got of my dad and aunt and how natural they looked. She was with me prior to my first look and again after when I was toasting my friends and waiting to go down the aisle. Nerves were at an all time high but Alex had such a great attitude and kept us all feeling positive and light before the big moment. We even had a bit of a disaster when a wind swept through before the event and the glass hurricanes went crashing down. Alex ran around trying to save what she could and told me it happens all the time and would be taken care of asap - which it was! Even though I was certain about Alex, I was speechless when I saw the photos. They were more than we could have hoped for, I am not used to being in front of the camera and she just made it all happen so seamlessly. I cannot recommend Alex enough - she is truly the BEST!

Alexandria was the most wonderful photographer. She was so professional and truly helped make the day better with her suggestions and her flow with the taking of the pictures. She ...

was open to any ideas or requests from us but kept us moving along at a great pace that did not stress the day but simply enhanced it and kept us all from loosing focus. The sneak peak of the pictures was wonderful and her and her co photographer made us feel like the capture of all the special moments was going to be magnificent and it was!!! The love the family the beauty the fun the laughter and the joy of the day was all captured through the lenses and she even stayed a tony bit longer to ensure we had all the memories we wanted captured. Truly the best money we spent for our wedding memories to be captured. She scouted the neighborhood before coming that morning to find us some great spots to capture off site pictures. We felt like movie stars at all times and are so thankful to have found her talent.

I was lucky enough to discover Alex by stumbling upon her amazing work via Instagram, which captivated me instantly. I was immediately drawn to her ability to capture the unique pe...

rsonalities and emotions of every special moment. Alex did our engagement photos as well as our welcome party and our wedding, and I truly believe there is no one better out there. She is our photographer soulmate! Alex was and is more than a photographer to us, she was with us through 2 years of pandemic postponements providing not just logistical but also emotional and moral support to us when we faced a lot of uncertainty and logistical hurdles. She was immediately responsive and there for us even when she must have been dealing with all sorts of postponements and cancellations due to the pandemic. Through it all, she was there for us. Alex is on top of every little detail (I mean every single one!) so you never have to worry about a thing, and she also takes the time to get to know you as people and understand what's important to you before your shoots. She makes you feel SO comfortable while shooting and gives great direction that makes you look amazing even when you aren't sure what to do. She also gives great advice overall when preparing for a wedding and truly is with you every step of the way. We look forward to working with Alex for life! And are so grateful to have the emotions and magic of our perfect wedding weekend forever immortalized through Alex's photos. And can we talk about how STUNNING her photos are? Truly works of art that just happen to have us and our special moments in them :) We've made several layflat photo albums and ordered large prints through her as well to hang up in our house forever to remember our special day. We look back at our engagement photos ALL the time. It's only been a week since our wedding and she already sent us a full album of sneaks that we absolutely died going through, reliving the whole dream weekend. I know we'll do the same when she sends the full album and truly can't imagine anyone doing a better job than Alex - it's been a 3 year journey of working with her so far and she's stuck with us for life!! :) Do yourself a favor and book Alex to photograph your wedding, engagement, welcome party...literally any photo moments she'll agree to do for you - plan ahead and book with her!

ng and was referred by a friend of ours and we instantly fell in love with all the albums she showed us. We contemplated because along with beautiful pictures comes a steep price but in the end it was all worth it! Our Wedding ended up getting postponed but Alex was able to accommodate us for our postponed date. Upon meeting Alex she was very friendly and easy to get a long with which my husband and I loved. She was always quick to respond and communicate with. She assisted us with choosing our engagement shoot locations and not to mention for people who are not use to having their pictures taken she made it easy. Alex has pretty much been there every step of the way in our wedding planning process. She always prioritized US and what we liked or wanted in our pictures. Our family and friends loved all of our pictures and she delivered in a timely manner. Not to mention the sneak peeks she provides for us a few days after the wedding. Alex really has an eye for photography. We loved that she was able to capture the most important day of our life. Thank You so much Alex! xoxo

We got married in November 2019 (right before the COVID crisis). We interviewed a few photographers to capture our big day in Palm Springs. Out of all of them Alex was the one who ...

we felt was going to capture our union of families as best as possible. And her results speak for themselves. Right after we committed, she sent us a welcome box with goodies - it gave us comfort knowing how seriously she takes her job. It's been two years since our wedding and we can't stop reviewing all of our photos. Alex and her team are extremely professional and know how to make the shots look perfect. As our family grows, we will definitely keep Alex on our first to call for photography.

STOP LOOKING - HIRE ALEX! I can't even begin to explain how grateful I am to have had Alex photograph our wedding - it was easily the best decision I made for the whole affair, ho...

nestly.. potentially behind selecting my husband. She is THAT amazing. After seeing her stunning work on Instagram, I reached out to Alex early 2019 for my fall wedding in 2020. She was one of the first vendors I selected, even before venue, location etc. simply because I knew I had to have her. Not only is she an absolute GENIUS of a photographer, but she is an incredible person as well. A pandemic hit, there were so many date changes, possible career changes, maybe moves, vacations..the list goes on and on for what we had to get through to make sure she was photographing our wedding. And she made it happen. She was ALWAYS responsive, even during a time where it felt like no other vendor was because they were "so busy" with two years of weddings in one. Alex never made me feel like she was too busy for our questions, concerns or even just check in's. She was on TOP of the timeline for the whole day, my other vendors even told me how impressed they were with her. She made us feel comfortable in front of the camera and made the whole thing so much fun! When she had to leave at the end of the night I literally started crying because of how amazing she had been throughout the 2 year process and how amazing she was the day of. I hadn't even seen the images yet and just was so thankful for her being by our side through it all. She got us sneak peaks just a short couple days after and I screamed at all of them. They truly came out better than I could have imagined and we will cherish them forever + ever. I can't wait to get our whole set in a few short weeks, even though I'm concerned for spontaneous combustion!! The only thing I wish is that I didn't even invite people to my wedding and just made the whole affair a photoshoot with Alex. Guess I'll just have to book her again :) THANK YOU ALEX!!!! WE LOVE YOU!!!

Alex is seriously the BEST! From booking all the way through getting our sneak peeks back, she has been so hands-on and attentive to our vision and details every step of the way. ...

We booked her for our very intimate elopement and she did not miss a beat to step in and provide suggestions and guidance on timeline, day of set up, flow, and details. She was absolutely amazing in guiding us through all of our photos in a way that felt natural, authentic, and candid. Getting our pictures back and seeing her vision come to life again through the photos is a clear testament to her exceptional talent in capturing real and raw moments. It was also important for us to work with a photographer that had experience working with same-sex brides so we could feel totally ourselves and completely comfortable on our special day, and let me tell you we are so glad we went with our gut and booked her! With how small and intimate our elopement was, Alex was so closely involved in every moment and it quickly felt like she was an honored guest celebrating our special day and not just another vendor by the attention, care, and excitement for us she showed. Our special day would not have been the same without her guidance along the way and our memories and all of the love and excitement on that day are forever perfectly captured because of her amazing work! Here's to working with you again in the future! ;D

ive in communication, very professional, and very fun to work with. She photographed us for our engagement, and got us sneak peeks within 2 days- amazing! The best part was our wedding in June. Due to life-changing events in her life, she was unable to be physically present for our wedding day, but gave us a 7-month notice. We still wanted to work with her in some way, so she proposed that 2 photographers fill in for her, and she would still edit our photos and generously offered a complimentary wedding album. We got the best package possible, working with 3 amazing photographers and still keep her as being involved in our wedding day even though she couldn’t be there the day of. I highly recommend Alex for her professionalism and compassion! She has a heart of gold and will truly take care of you and if she can’t, she will figure out a way. Love her. Thank you Alex! We will cherish our photos for a lifetime!

Alex the magician! I met Alex 11+ years ago when we both went to Italy for a study abroad program through the same college. As people usually do we lost touch but I found her on ...

instagram when she took some amazing wedding photos for two different classmates (2017 & 2018). She was also the wedding photographer for close friends of ours in 2019. Let me tell you she keeps getting better!! We wanted something different when it came to our photos…. magazine cover worthy if you will. Beyoncé and JayZ type vibes. My husband is very detailed, artistic and creative so when he saw Alex’s work the search was over. She gave us EPIC photos! All the vibes we wanted sexy, moody, playful… etc. for our engagement and wedding photos. Of course, still provided family photos to cherish. Don’t know how to pose no worries, Alex has your back. Don’t know where the heck your wedding photos will take place at your venue? Alex does her research. Need vendor recommendations? Alex created her own wedding planning magazine. Wedding photo timeline? Alex provides you a form to fill out with who and what you want captured on your wedding day. She worked with us to reschedule during the pandemic and updated us with COVID guidelines on social media as well. Alex isn’t your basic wedding photographer she has true talent. There were so many photos she provided where I was in awe of her! How the heck did she think to do that?! lol I could go on but her work speaks for itself 😏

ed out SO good. The colors, the lighting, the candid moments, the smiles, the details. I have so many people commenting to me how amazing my pictures turned out. We can’t believe these are our wedding pictures! Alex was the first vendor I chose back in 2019 (before Covid) and she’s been with us every step of the way navigating 2020 to make this wedding happen! You can tell she puts in a lot of hard work, time and passion into her business, making guides and vendor suggestions. We were so lucky we got to keep her after having to change our original date. We did an engagement session with her too, which I highly recommend, especially if you’ve never been through a photo shoot before and don’t know what to do with your hands. Alex guides you through poses so you don’t feel awkward and makes it SO fun. She also was an awesome leader during the wedding day process, getting everyone together to be where they needed to be. SHE DOES SO MANY THINGS. At the end of the night I could tell she worked her butt off making sure we got ALL the important shots and for that we are forever grateful. O! AND we got sneak peaks on our honeymoon which I wasn’t even expecting and THAT WAS FREAKIN AWESOME!!!!

e wait for our big day WELL worth it! She helped us navigate postponing, rescheduling, and last minute changes up until the final weeks. The day of - Alex and her team helped our bridal party, family, and friends to stay on time and on schedule, all the while ensuring we were having the time of our lives! They joined us on the dance floor and even grabbed a guests polaroid camera to snap some fun candid shots of us! I can't tell you how many of our guests complimented how amazing the photography team was and we're already gushing over our sneak peek photos. We cannot recommend Alex and her team enough for truly going above and beyond. We are forever grateful for the gorgeous moments they captured for our long awaited day and will cherish our photos for a lifetime. It's one thing to hire a photographer to capture your special moments but it's rare that you're able to find someone that makes you feel comfortable, confident, and feels like they're a friend that's known you a long time (and just happens to be realllly talented at taking photos lol!) THANK YOU times a million Alex!!

My husband and I both feel uncomfortable in front of the lens, so Alex's ability to create an environment which is relaxed and fun was a total game-changer. She is not only insanely talented, but also incredibly professional. She was always responsive and flexible through various changes, both pandemic and non-pandemic related. We have an enormous amount of gratitude to have worked with Alex, and hope to again sometime in the future. Thank you for everything Alex! You are a true gem of a human, and a creative inspiration! \- Cori & Rahul

just fun to interact with from the first moment we spoke. She photographed our engagement, our wedding, and even a boudoir surprise for my hubby. Our experience began with design ideas, location scouting, attire suggestions, and hair/makeup referrals. Alex was always available for us to bounce ideas off of and guide us in the right direction based on her experience. During the shoot she made us feel safe and comfortable. She directed us in such a way that we were able to open up, be ourselves, flow with the “poses”, and have a tremendous amount of fun while doing it. To top off the whole experience, she delivered flawless photos. Her editing and style is so on point with what we envisioned. She captured such tear jerking moments that I didn’t even realize she was taking photos of. We are so thrilled to have these everlasting memories she helped capture...and even more thrilled to have found our forever photographer. 💜

The reason we went with her was because she was highly recommend, but also because she’s really able to to capture the couples true essence. She does something really special where she photographs personality and movement without it looking generic and posed. Overall she was very accommodating, very sweet extremely professional, & made us feel very comfortable. 10 out 10.

She wore a mask the entire time, maintained social distance while still getting really intimate shots, and was really helpful in making sure all guests felt safe while gathering for photos. Most importantly, the pictures turned out great and really captured how special the day was. Would absolutely recommend her to anyone!

ue in March of 2019, Alexandria was the first wedding vendor we booked. Booking her was one of, if not the best, decision of our entire wedding planning process. Although I'd followed her on social media for a long time and loved her pictures, before finalizing everything she also took the time to chat with me on the phone to answer all of my questions and I knew she was the one! We booked Alex for both wedding day photos and an engagement shoot, so that we could get used to being photographed. I really recommend booking an engagement shoot with her: not only do we love the photos, but also meeting up in person took away any anxiety we might have had on the wedding day. We asked Alex to totally direct us--telling us poses and even where to put our hands--and she was open to doing that entirely and we firmly believe the pictures were a success because of that. We also got to try out a lot of different poses during the engagement shoot to figure out what looked good for the wedding day. Our experience with Alex during our engagement shoot made us confident that any pose she suggested to us on our wedding day would come out looking amazing! Some other things that she did for our engagement shoot that were above and beyond: looked at photos of different outfit choices and advised us on what to wear (!), drove out all the way to Santa Monica for us, provided us hundreds of different, beautiful photos in different poses for us to choose from. Now the wedding day: I was drawn to Alex's photographs for how genuine, beautiful, and artful they are, and our photos are better than I could have dreamed. Not only did she capture us and our day wonderfully, but she was truly the best vendor to have at our wedding. It was like hanging out with a friend on the day of! At one point on the dance floor, someone actually stepped on my train and ripped my bustle off (the horror!) and Alex came through with a safety pin and pinned my train up to my dress so I could keep dancing! If that isn't above and beyond, I don't know what is! And with the photos, she made us feel completely at ease throughout the day and captured so many different looks and locations for us. She was also open both to directing us/our bridal parties as well as to my ideas (such as my request for a cool shot with my veil), and she directed our friends and family with authority and ease. Her second shooter was also incredible and a joy to be around, and took the most gorgeous, relaxed shots of my husband. We're obsessed with our wedding photos. Our photos capture our genuine joy and love, but Alex also made sure we looked our best, and that balance is something very few photographers know how to create. Alex takes photos with love and we feel that love in our photos. I would fly Alex to the moon to take my wedding photos. I cannot recommend her highly enough. So much of wedding planning was stressful, and Alex was bright light. Look no further, book Alexandria for your wedding day!

did an engagement shoot in Palm Springs in December 2019. My fiancée and I were a little concerned that we might feel uncomfortable or artificial during the shoot, but Alex put us perfectly as ease. She got our instagrams before the shoot, to get a sense of our style, helped us think about outfits, and even asked what music we like(Carly Rae Jepsen was the soundtrack) to set up a shoot playlist. The shoot itself was exciting and fun- as she told us, this should be like a fun date, and that’s exactly what it felt like. Despite it being snowy and windy up near Joshua Tree, the polar opposite of what we were expecting, Alex was a champ, coming up with a great plan for everything on the fly. In terms of the actual photos - we loved them. Alex’s eye, selection, and very natural editing style had us amazed with each and every single photo. We both cannot recommend Alex more, and would definitely go back to her for any more shoots!

Working with Alex was a dream. She took my wedding photos when my husband and I eloped in Palm Springs. We live in Minneapolis so weren't able to meet with her beforehand. It felt ...

like a risk doing wedding photos with a photographer we've never worked with, but we loved Alex's work so decided to go for it. I'm so glad we did!! Not being from the area, I felt needy beforehand asking tons of questions about locations and recommendations for hair/makeup artists. Alex always responded quickly and really went the extra to be helpful. I also loved the planning magazine she sent beforehand. During the shoot, Alex was amazing at giving us guidance on poses and expressions which was super helpful for me as someone who is generally awkward being photographed. She was so easy to talk to, kept us laughing constantly, and made us feel comfortable which is definitely reflected in the photos. Now that we have our photos back (it only took her about a week to get them edited and back to us - amazing!), I can't stop looking at them! She captured our love perfectly and took a great mix of candid and posed photos. I feel so proud of them and know we'll treasure them forever. I'm really thankful for Alex's work and am so glad we picked her as our photographer. I'd hire her 1000 times over again. Worth every penny. Thank you!!

gorgeous photos spoke for themselves and I was hooked. Since we did a destination wedding in Palm Springs, we didn’t get a chance to meet Alex until our wedding day. Luckily for us, it turns out she’s a badass, fun, photographer who put both me and my husband (who hates having his picture taken) at ease. Leading up to the wedding, Alex was great to work with—she sent us a lovely and thoughtful care package once we hired her and was extremely helpful with vendor recommendations since we weren’t as familiar with Palm Springs vendors. She frequently checked in and made sure we were comfortable with our shot lists and was quick to offer help if we had any questions. The day of the wedding, she was fun and creative (it rained allllll day) and so easy going. I absolutely LOVED hanging with her all day. We received sneak peeks the week after our wedding—while most of my recently-married friends have received 3-4 pictures for their sneak peek, we received 20+ pictures which was so amazing to have so soon after the big day. We received our full wedding album 6 weeks after our wedding – and the pictures were incredible. Hands down, Alex was one of the best choices we made in selecting wedding vendors. Do yourself a favor and book her!!

She will will fix your hair, make you laugh and cry (good tears), and be your number one hype girl from start to finish. She is passionate about her work and you can feel that love and energy in her presence. By the time you are done working with her you will feel like you have made an incredible new friend. You might even want to bring her on your honeymoon with you because honestly we loved her that much! Trust me when I say you NEED to hire this girl!

ouldn’t be the day we wanted it to be or the memories we wanted to take from it, without Alex being our photographer. We booked her almost immediately after getting engaged and from that point forward, we not only had a photographer, we had an experienced supporter, a honorary maid of honor, a cheer leader. Alex was quick to offer advice and encouragement when we needed it- took every opportunity to make us comfortable and make the day run smoothly. She even went as far as to ask about family tensions to help ease and avoid any negative vibes on the day of. Alex’s photos are magic. She captures moments that you’d never realize another person would see as special. She puts an extraordinary amount of work into scouting the perfect spot for each photo, she would be perched in trees and hiding behind rocks during parts of the wedding where I would catch eyes with her and just giggle in awe over her commitment to getting the shot. She pulled me aside if I seemed stressed, she commiserated with me with I was on the verge of making a scene, she laughed with me when family was being weird, and she captured the love between my husband and I, and our combined families. We got our sneak peak gallery right before we left for our honey moon, and relived our wedding day every day of our honeymoon as we flipped through her work every single day. Her photos are stunning, her personality is magic, her company puts you at ease, her work is full of love, and she is beyond what you’d imagine your photographer to be. Alex will be a part of my wedding memory forever and though I’ll never get married again, I hope to have the opportunity to be graced by be talent again.

ack on planning, photography was such an important decision for us as one of the only things we would have forever from our wedding day. We spent a few months searching and loved Alex’s work when we stumbled across it. Her photos are like unfolding a story, with tons of detail and emotion, and the colors in her photos are so vivid and just pop! But my husband and I both agree the real reason you want to hire Alex is that she is such a sweetheart and so experienced. She is meticulously organized, which alleviated a lot of stress for me with planning. She was on top of every detail and we could always rely on her honest opinions and advice. Sometimes I would text her with questions and never once felt guilty about it because she sincerely wants to help. She truly has her couples’ best interest at heart, which is what makes her GOLD! She is also SO fun to work with. She was like having a personal cheerleader and literally would sweat her ass off each time she worked for us! (The wedding confirmed it wasn't the biking engagement shoot, but just her drive to chase you for a perfect shot!) I would also tell any couple questioning an engagement shoot to *DO IT*! We were both a little nervous to be the center of attention, but Alex made it so easy. We loved every image because they incorporated places and things we love as a couple and I know we’ll always cherish these just as much as our wedding photos! Thank you for everything Alex!! Your guidance, grace, and spirit were everything we could have ever asked for! - Kelsey & David
