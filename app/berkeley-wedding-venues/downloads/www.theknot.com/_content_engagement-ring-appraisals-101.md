Your engagement ring is a big purchase, and it comes with big responsibility. While no one wants to think about the possibility of losing or damaging their ring, life happens, and it's important to make sure you're covered in the event of a worst-case scenario. An engagement ring appraisal is an important step in insuring your engagement ring so it can be replaced or replicated in the event of theft, loss or [ring damage](https://www.theknot.com/content/engagement-ring-hazards-damage). Below, we've outlined everything you need to know about getting an engagement ring appraisal—from how and where to get one, plus expert insight on why they are so important.

## What Is an Engagement Ring Appraisal?

An important step in the engagement ring shopping process you may not be thinking of is getting a wedding ring appraisal. To put it simply, an engagement ring appraisal is an official document that lays out all of the facts about your engagement ring. "An engagement ring appraisal is a document used by insurance companies in the event an item is lost, stolen or damaged," Sarah Ortega, founder and CEO of [Sarah O.](https://www.sarahojewelry.com/), explains. "The appraisal includes specific details about the center stone, side stones, and setting of the ring and what the retail replacement value is." This will also often include high-quality photographs of your ring so you can closely replicate it in the event that something happens to it. 

[READ MORE Your Complete Guide to Engagement Ring Insurance ](https://www.theknot.com/content/engagement-ring-insurance-101)

"The details of an appraisal include the exact specifications of a center stone, like the color, clarity, measurements and diamond grading report information, along with the specific details of a setting," Ortega shares. "Those details include side stone color and clarity, total weight, identifying details and prong style."

While it may seem like an unnecessary step, an engagement ring appraisal is so important to ensure your ring is protected in a worst-case scenario. You can have a jewelry appraisal for insurance done by a certified jeweler, estate or financial planner. When in doubt, your [engagement ring insurance](https://www.theknot.com/content/engagement-ring-insurance-101) provider can help you determine which type of engagement ring appraisal is appropriate for you.

It's also worth noting that a ring appraisal is different from the diamond grading report you got from your jeweler. A diamond grading report tells you everything you need to know about your diamond (like how it's graded according to [the 4 Cs](https://www.theknot.com/content/engagement-ring-diamond-grading)). An engagement ring appraiser assigns a value to your entire ring, taking the diamond (and any other stones present) as well as the metal into consideration.

## How Much Does an Engagement Ring Appraisal Cost? 

The cost for an engagement ring varies depending on where you go. Some jewelers, including Sarah O., include a complimentary engagement ring appraisal when [buying an engagement ring](https://www.theknot.com/content/engagement-ring-buying-steps), though you can also have your ring appraised independently. "There are plenty of reputable independent appraisers available for antique and heirloom items," Ortega tells us. You should be able to find diamond ring appraisal prices prominently posted at any jeweler; if not, you can always reach out to the jeweler directly for a price estimate. In most cases, expect to pay between $75 and $100 for your engagement ring appraisal, though prices can vary depending on the complexity and time required for the appraisal, as well as the jeweler's expertise.

## Why You Should Get an Engagement Ring Appraisal

While it may seem like an unnecessary extra cost, an engagement ring appraisal is actually very important in a worst-case scenario. Think of it as an official receipt in case anything were to happen to your ring. Believe it or not, your homeowners or renters insurance likely won't fully cover your engagement ring in the event of loss, theft or damage. Jewelry insurance specifically covers your engagement ring, and it is usually much less expensive than a replacement ring. However, in order to get proper coverage, an appraisal is needed so the insurance company can properly evaluate the ring. "Appraisals are often necessary for insurance coverage in the event that an item is lost, stolen or damaged," Ortega explains. 

Your ring appraisal will also give you the actual value of your ring, which is sometimes different from the price you paid for it. The market for diamonds, gemstones and metals is fluid, so the value of your ring will change over time. Experts recommend getting appraisals every few years to ensure the actual value of your ring is documented. Some insurance policies also require updated appraisals every few years, so be sure to look into the specifics of your coverage plan. 

## When You Should Get an Engagement Ring Appraisal

The best time to get your engagement ring appraised is as soon as possible. "An appraisal should be provided to a client when they receive their ring or piece of jewelry," Ortega shares. If your jeweler does not provide an appraisal at the time of purchase, you should seek out your own appraisal shortly after. 

Once you have an appraisal, you can then get a jewelry insurance policy to cover any potential loss or damage. It's important to note that a diamond engagement ring appraisal also serves as a double check to ensure your ring is in excellent condition at the time of purchase. Especially if you chose a vintage ring, this step may alert you to existing damage or wear and tear you may not have noticed otherwise, such as a [chipped diamond](https://www.theknot.com/content/can-diamonds-chip) or warped band. 

## Where to Get Your Engagement Ring Appraised 

If your jeweler is unable to offer an appraisal, some organizations can connect you with individuals who specialize in appraisals. Some of these resources are listed below.

  * [National Association of Jewelry Appraisers](https://najaappraisers.com/)
  * [The American Gem Society](https://www.americangemsociety.org/en/find-an-appraiser)
  * [IGI](https://www.igi.org/eservices/appraisals)



Additionally, [The Knot Vendor Marketplace](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/jewelers) is a valuable resource to find local jewelers who can offer engagement ring appraisals. We also recommend a good old-fashioned word of mouth—ask your friends if they have any recommendations on where to get an engagement ring appraised.
