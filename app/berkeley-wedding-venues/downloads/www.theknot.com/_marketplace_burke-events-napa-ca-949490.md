We are so thankful to our amazing wedding planner Solmaz and her Burkevents team for helping make our wedding dreams come true. We had the most magical, beautiful, fun, and fairy-...

tale wedding day thanks to all of the help and support from Solmaz. It was a joy and pleasure working with Solmaz to plan our special day. She is fantastic. We truly miss our calls with her! We would not have been able to plan our 200-person wedding without her, especially with both of us working full time. I wish that we connected with her at the very beginning our planning process. Before we met her, we had visited so many venues over the past several months and were confused and frustrated having not made a decision yet. Once we had Solmaz on our team, she immediately made us a side-by-side comparison and budget analysis between our top two venues and talked us through important areas to consider between the two. She helped guide us towards making the final decision on our venue and date and we couldn’t have been happier getting our dream venue (The Taglyan Complex in Hollywood)! We appreciate all of Solmaz’s hard work and numerous hours of planning and coordinating with us and all of our vendors. She had a comprehensive checklist to make sure we were on track with our tasks. Being a bride and planning a wedding can be stressful, but Solmaz eased my anxiety on many occasions, answered all of my many questions or found answers to them, and made everything super fun too. I especially appreciate that she flew to LA for a site visit of our church and venue prior to the wedding. She also has a great eye for detail and elegance. She gave awesome suggestions on our printed items such as our Save the Dates, invitations, and menus for the wedding. Solmaz was honest throughout the year we worked with her and we appreciated her opinions on vendors or other important decisions that we had to make. She created a very detailed timeline with us and made sure to share it with all of our vendors prior to the wedding. We also had calls with important vendors prior to the big day to go over the timeline and answer questions. Everything was perfect on our special day and we couldn’t have been happier! We were able to truly be in the moment and enjoy our big day because we knew that we were in great hands with Solmaz and her team. I honestly had no worry or anxiety on my special day which was shocking being a bride! My husband and I felt like we were floating on clouds. Solmaz was enthusiastic, calm, supportive, and confident on wedding day. Many of our guests commented after the wedding about how gorgeous it was, how organized it felt, and how seamless everything flowed. Solmaz also stayed until the very end of the wedding (which not all wedding planners do) and made sure everything was ok and all of our important items or gifts were packed and ready to be transported back to the hotel with our designated family members. We are grateful for this. We hope to work with her again in the future for another event. Thank you so much from the bottom of our hearts, Solmaz for everything.

We provided the team with inspiration and insight into our lives, and they brought it all to life in a magnificent 3-day wedding festival filled with elegance, authentic wine country elements, and non-stop celebration. It exceeded all our dreams and expectations. The entire Burkevents team deserves more than 5 stars for ensuring that the entire wedding weekend was stress-free for both my husband and me. Every single detail was flawlessly executed. Working with this exceptional company is a decision you won't regret.

I cannot express enough how incredible Solmaz was in assisting with the planning of my daughter's wedding last year. It is difficult to find words to adequately thank her for her t...

ireless effort, kindness, and patience throughout the entire planning process. She went above and beyond to bring our vision to life, even when faced with unpredictable weather on the day of the outdoor wedding. Despite the challenges, she remained unwavering in her determination to make our dream a reality, flawlessly juggling every aspect. I am filled with nothing but gratitude for her assistance throughout the past year. I have consistently told her how proud she should be of her exceptional work. Her calm and reassuring nature, along with her unwavering commitment to perfection, make her an invaluable resource. She consistently follows through promptly and addresses every question and concern with thoroughness. Without a doubt, Solmaz has been the most wonderful planning partner. She is simply the best!

o easy to work with. I am a type A bride and she put up with all of my craziness with a smile and was able to keep my groom and I laughing the whole way through. She has saved the day countless times in numerous situations- one of which had to do with some family members and she handled it so gracefully and kindly. She has excellent taste and was able to steer my ideas to make sure they were consistent and made sense. Every detail was looked after and executed with such class and elegance. Our guests do not stop talking about how beautiful and amazing the wedding was. Solmaz made excellent suggestions about vendors especially based on our budget- and helped us look for details when hiring. She always looked through contracts and made sure everything was "Kosher" if you will. The day of our wedding was a breeze and I worried about nothing because I had her there running the show. She always was on top of our timeline and making sure that things were running smoothly. It was the most special, amazing, beautiful and memorable day of our lives and It wouldn't have been possible without Solmaz. We could not thank you enough for all the hard work you put in- we are so incredibly excited for your new adventure and all the amazing clients that will come your way.

On the day of the event, they were on top of everything, ensuring that everything ran smoothly and according to plan. Their presence alone brought a sense of calm and confidence to the day.

because this was a destination wedding for us and we did not arrive into town until 3 days before our event. They took care of an inordinate number of details and worked seamlessly with each of our vendors.

Solmaz was extremely patient and kind through it all. On wedding day, everything was PERFECT! Every detail was handled by Solmaz and her team. They worked so well with the venue and all my vendors.

If you are looking for a wedding planner, look no further than Solmaz at Pretty Occasions. Her elegant taste, attention to detail, and gentle happiness will make your wedding plann...

ing process what it should be: easy and fun. My husband and I were lucky enough to plan not one, but TWO weddings with Solmaz. The first, a May 2020 wedding that was unfortunately cancelled. Solmaz had already helped us select our venue, florist, caterer, baker, hotel block… everything! Simple and easy, the deposits were out, our spreadsheets filled out, my dress altered. It was going to be stunning and the only thing that could stop the beautiful day from coming to life was a global pandemic. I was already obsessed with Solmaz’s work, but after cancelling, her care in working with our vendors to find a new date and patience in planning what turned out to be entirely different (but better!) wedding solidifies that Solmaz was the absolute perfect person for us. A lot of things happen the month leading up to your wedding and this is where Solmaz shined. We had multiple calls a week with vendors to solidify final details, she ordered items herself that we had forgotten, and she had the vision to keep this complicated machine of dozens of people organized and aligned. Solmaz also hosted our rehearsal and (as a high stress person) I felt confident that our wedding was going to be perfect. Day of, I got to enjoy my hair and makeup and a couple mimosas, because Solmaz and her team were working behind the scenes to get everything ready. The venue, an old bank in SF, was transformed into my wildest dreams. All day she was by our side: from coordinating our 20 person wedding party to take photos, to our mixed Persian/American ceremony, to dinner (which she actually got us to sit down and eat!), to a last minute change in sound ordinance so we had to move the party inside. I often hear from brides that their wedding was a blur with so much going on, but I feel with Solmaz I was able to be present and have a blast at my own wedding. What a dream that day was and I have to say Solmaz’s company name undersells themselves: they are, in fact, Stunning Beautiful Gorgeous Tremendous Occasions.

My wedding weekend was the most fun, special, exciting days of my life and I owe a lot of that to owner of Pretty Occasions, Solmaz Burke! I was a bride that needed a lot of sugges...

tions/ideas, help deciding on things and help getting things done/scheduled. I am not very creative, I had no preconceived notions on what I wanted and I have a full time job which all would have made it impossible to plan and execute a wedding on my own. I was so thrilled with the way everything turned out and I felt like I barely had to lift a finger throughout the process. My wedding was six months ago and I am still getting compliments and I know it is because everything was well-done, well-thought out and well-executed (all by Solmaz & her team) and the guests could tell. My dad was very hyper-sensitive about the logistics of the day and had a few very specific ideas and she did a great job of going above and beyond to listen to his concerns/ideas, come up with solutions and follow through to make sure they were addressed and communicated well before wedding day. I have already and will continue to recommend Pretty Occasions to all of my engaged friends. Solmaz made the most special day of my life up until this point just that - special!

rds, recognition, reviews and previous wedding styles in her profile caught my eye first so I sent an email to her and what stood out next was how quickly she responded and with assurance she could help me plan my dream wedding in less than 6 months. And that she did! I could not be more happy with every detail she helped create to make our day more gorgeous than I could have ever dreamed!!! What I loved about working with Solmaz is her professionalism, experience, efficiency, availability to chat anytime, creativity, excellent follow up, value she placed on staying within our budget, honest advice, a fair price for her services, her outstanding organizational skills and ability to understand the style I was looking for and ability to create it in our budget. She found the perfect venue at Chateau St Jean Vineyard in Sonoma, Ca for our ceremony and reception and made me feel so assured I would love it that we never saw the venue in person until 3 days before our wedding day. She also helped build our website with hotel profiles and attractions for our guests. Solmaz also has incredibly professional, talented and reliable vendors that we worked with that pulled together our dreamy day perfectly. And when I sought out vendors beyond her recommendations, she vetted and contacted them on my behalf. She was always willing to help, do any follow up and always kept our entire process organized and stress free for me and if she had any stress, she never let it show, she is very calm under pressure and I think can pull of anything!! Solmaz has a lot of experience with a variety of wedding types and venues and she truly used that experience and confidence and went above and beyond on every detail while showing incredible patience with me. Solmaz reassured me that no matter what, our day would be perfect. And wow did she ever deliver!! I am forever grateful and I would highly recommend Solmaz Burke and Pretty Occasions for her full wedding planning services. THANK YOU SOLMAZ! Sincerely, Rhonda

Solmaz was the BEST wedding planner we could ever wish for. I feel so lucky that I found her!! Pretty Occasions was listed as preferred vendor by our venue in Sonoma. I contacted a...

ll the vendors on the list but I felt she is very professional and organized with very reasonable price. And turned out to be more than that! In the beginning of the planning stage, we had weekly calls on Thursdays to sync up vendor research, budgeting, designing, other logistic stuff even though we hired her just as a partial planner. She gave us so many good advice. When searching for rentals, she even met us in person several times to discuss design and give us recommendations. During the days leading to the wedding, things got even more easier with Solmaz as couples would feel very stressed. She coordinated many things with venue coordinator and all the other vendors to make sure things go smoothly on the day without bothering us. On the wedding day, she and team came early to set up everything as planned. During the day, she and team led all the transitions and always be there when we needed them. They collected and organized all personal stuff in the end and gave back to us. We were so surprised they even collected the vows we wrote that we left on our sweetheart table. All in all, we were so glad that we chose Solmaz and team for the big day. Everything was perfect. Thank you so much Solmaz!

We are both pretty clueless when it comes to this stuff--all we had was simple requests for look, feel, and style--but she was able to turn a couple of Pinterest inspiration boards into a beautiful San Francisco wedding. She was there with us every step of the way, from suggesting vendors to touring venues, and when the big day came, everything went off without a hitch and we didn't have to worry about anything. Thank you so much, Solmaz and Pretty Occasions!

We highly recommend Solmaz Burke to plan your wedding! We chose Solmaz to be our day of wedding coordinator for our wedding on September 22, 2018. Solmaz was a consummate professio...

nal from the time we first met in person to discuss our wedding plans for our big day till the end. Solmaz worked with us closely the month leading up to the wedding. She set up conference calls with our vendors (Wedding Hall, Videographer, Band, etc.) to finalize all the details for our wedding day. The day before our wedding for our rehearsal walk through, Solmaz walked everyone through the procession and ceremony which was no easy task since our wedding party consisted of our niece and 5 nephews ranging in age from 3-12. The day of the wedding Solmaz and her staff made sure the day was perfect and went off without a hitch. My wife and I did not worry about any of the details, we were able to fully enjoy our wedding due to the amazing efficiency and planning of Solmaz. One story from the day I want to share is that Solmaz saved the day! The bakery we chose for our wedding cake delivered our 3 tier cake with the top 2 tiers crushed. Solmaz was able to have the bakery have the replacement 2 tiers delivered before the cocktail hour began at 5pm so the cake could be displayed. This was all done unbeknownst to my wife and I, which is one of the many reasons we recommend any recently engaged couples to choose Solmaz Burke as your wedding Coordinator!!!

My wife and I interviewed several wedding planners before settling on Pretty Occasions. We were drawn by Solmaz’s competence as well as the colorful and creative narratives she pro...

posed around our wedding theme and direction. These narratives played a big role in helping us understand what kind of wedding we wanted, and what styles and ideas would fully align with our hopes and expectations. Our destination wedding in SF needed someone who could introduce and guide us through the planning process while we were on the other side of the country. In two short visits, Solmaz toured us through several exceptional venues and vendors. In every case we were able to find perfect matches for every detail and idea we were hoping to convey. On the day of our wedding, everything came together perfectly. Thank you, Solmaz! You gave us the wedding of our dreams!

line. Solmaz is clearly an industry veteran, and her experience, discerning eye and excellent coordination and foresight will be invaluable in planning and making decisions. Her team is also superb and equally professional - we were so happy with Solmaz’s attentiveness, organization and quick thinking. She led our day-of support, and we don't know what we would've done without her. Our wedding took place on two floors - not to mention the multiple getting-ready and photoshoot locations pre-ceremony - but Solmaz and the team had all bases and details perfectly covered. They were so present throughout the wedding, in a way that gave me peace of mind to just enjoy the night! Several of our guests even commented on our day-of support team and how on top of everything they were. A big thank you to the Pretty Occasions team for helping a frazzled couple out when we were in over our heads :)

She compiled a serious dream team of San Francisco vendors who were all beyond talented and so much fun to work with. The day of the wedding, Solmaz and her team were a machine. Everything went off perfectly. Literally nothing went wrong (at least that I knew of....). They made sure every detail was perfectly executed. It was the best night of our lives and we have Solmaz to thank for that. I couldn't recommend Pretty Occasions enough for your special event!

z. She makes my job as a florist easy. She communicates well on design details and is a true team player. I met Solmaz back in 2016, where we did our first wedding together. The ceremony took place at Grace Cathedral Church and the reception was at The Legion of Honor. I ran into an issue that day where I needed to transfer some items from the church to the reception but couldn't stay for the ceremony to finish as I had to go set-up the reception room for dinner. Solmaz without being asked offered to take these items of mine for me from the church to the reception. We also worked together on a wedding at The Bently Reserve where I had to set-up the reception room by noon, in order to allow me the allocated time to set-up my second wedding that day in the city. The only way this was possible was by having the help of Solmaz. The table linens for the wedding were originally supposed to be dropped off by the rental company around 2pm. She offered to pick up the linens for the wedding the day before and bring them at 10am the day of the wedding to have the room set-up for me to start my designs. These 2 weddings I talked about are examples of how Solmaz goes above and beyond. They were never required of her to do, and I really appreciate everything she does!!! She has always made a lasting impression on me and I always look forward to working on weddings with her.

Solmaz was such a FABULOUS planner! I really enjoyed working with her and she made our day SO SPECIAL! From our first consultation with Solmaz, we really liked her personality ...

and appreciated that she was so flexible with her schedule to meet with us while we were in California planning our destination wedding. Her prices are more than fair compared to other planners in the Napa/Sonoma/San Francisco area! Once we had signed on to work with Solmaz, she got us a planning checklist and started working through each item, line-by-line, with us. As a couple planning a destination wedding across the country, it was so comforting to know that Solmaz had experience working with vendors in that area and had wonderful suggestions on which vendors to choose! We would have been searching for reviews and recommendations on the Knot and elsewhere for hours if we didn't have her help. Solmaz helped us select so many details, from our officiant, florist, videographer, and caterer to our linens, tables & chairs, and our rehearsal dinner location. No detail was too large or too small. My husband was hesitant to spend money on a planner, but he soon saw how essential having cross-country help was. Solmaz was the single-best investment we made towards our wedding day. One of the amazing things Solmaz did to help our day run smoothly was allowing me to ship various wedding items I ordered (place cards, wine glasses, card box, guest book, etc.) to her home rather than trying to travel across the country with these various items. As much as we appreciated her help with planning, she was an indispensable asset during our wedding week. Every wedding has small hiccups, and Solmaz dealt with them all (and probably more than we even knew about) without batting an eye. 2 days before our big day, our Videographer became ill and had to be rushed to the hospital for emergency surgery. Solmaz started calling around town and within about an hour had multiple videographers available for us to choose from. We were able to book another videographer that same day. The day before our wedding, our officiant forgot to come to our rehearsal. Solmaz stood in for him, making sure everyone knew their places and roles for our big day, running our wedding rehearsal. Our wedding was at Kunde Family Winery in Kenwood - a HUGE venue to cover with driving required to traverse between our getting ready at Hill House, our ceremony atop Boot Hill, and our Reception at Winemakers plaza. Solmaz made it look effortless as she set up each location to make sure every detail was perfect. And magically, anytime I had a question, she just happened to be right there, ready with an answer. To sum it up, YES, you NEED a wedding planner, especially if you're planning a destination wedding across the country. And yes, Solmaz is more than worth her weight in gold in making every dream you have for your big day come true. Her value cannot be overstated.

We picked pretty occasions after interviewing several wedding planners. We had (unknown to us) an aggressive timeline for when we wanted a wedding so During the first phase Solmaz...

got us started on the path right away. She took descriptions of what we wanted and then created a list of recommended sites. They all matched what we wanted in some way but after we made the decisions she help us review and plan the contract. During the middle stage she help us find the right vendors (within) the restrictions of our chosen venue. She had good recommendations and we were very happy with all of the venues. The week before our wedding the venue called. The Napa fires (https://goo.gl/uTpQn4) where closing the location down. We were dumb struck. By the middle of the afternoon that same day (3 days before the wedding) Solmaz had used her contacts so we had a list of locations to choose from. When we picked the location Solmaz went to work negotiating the more expensive location we had choosen down a similar price to the orginal venue. The rest of the week she spend coordinating with the other vendors to ensure everything arrived and and was arranged for the new locations. We had a great wedding. Our guest were stunned but how smoothly it ran. We got comments telling us it looked like it had always been planned for the new location.

When we walked into the venue, everything was exactly how we'd imagined it. Solmaz was attentive all night, making sure we had drinks, food, cake, etc. and she gave us cues when we needed to do cake cutting, last song, etc. She was such a calming and level-headed presence throughout the wedding planning process and we appreciate her guidance and counsel so much!
