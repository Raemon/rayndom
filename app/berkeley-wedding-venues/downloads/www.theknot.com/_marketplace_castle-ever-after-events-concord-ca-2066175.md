I don’t even know where to start with Jessica and Tania except to say: HIRE THEM. We first brought them on when we had booked a traditional venue, and little did I know we’d end u...

p pivoting to a private estate wedding instead. That kind of change could have been a nightmare, but they took it completely in stride. We upgraded our package to their bespoke package and they came with us to vendor visits, walked the (very not plug-and-play) property multiple times, and came up with ideas and solutions I never would’ve thought of. Every time something shifted, they were already three steps ahead with a game plan. On top of all that, we were traveling to ten other weddings while planning our own. It was a lot. Jessica consistently checked in with me throughout all of it so nothing fell through the cracks. Even when I was on a plane or in another state, I knew she was keeping us on track, following up with vendors, and making sure decisions were made when they needed to be. That level of support was priceless. On the actual wedding day, they did. not. stop. I don’t think I saw either of them sit down once. They were quietly everywhere: fixing small things before I even noticed them, keeping the timeline on track, making sure vendors were where they needed to be, and somehow also checking in on me so I remembered to breathe and eat. One result of that was I got to just be present and enjoy the day instead of worrying about logistics. Maybe the biggest gift they gave me, though, was peace of mind in the months leading up to the wedding. I was juggling two sets of parents (with opinions!) and my husband, and they helped me navigate it all without losing my sanity. They listened, they problem-solved, and they were kind but direct when I needed someone to just tell me what would actually work. If you’re looking for coordinators who are all-in, creative, organized, and genuinely care about you having the best day ever, Jessica and Tania are it. I would hire them again in a heartbeat.

My (now) husband and I worked with Tania towards the end of our wedding planning process and I could not have more incredible things to say about her and Castle Ever After Events. ...

Tania was supportive, attentive, knowledgeable, and beyond reliable. She truly listened to the ideas we had and the vision we wanted for our day and helped make it happen. And when gentle guidance or slight redirection was needed, she offered it with kindness, never as a demand. We knew our day was in good hands with Tania. The only thing I wish could have been different was us hiring her EARLIER! As stressful and overwhelming as planning a wedding is and can be, Tania will undoubtedly ease those feelings and do everything in her power to make the process as fun and enjoyable as possible. We cannot recommend Tania enough. (:

We knew that we had picked the right wedding coordinator as all of our vendors commented on how organized, detailed, and friendly Jessica was throughout the entire process. We had a very organized timeline throughout our wedding day, which made us feel relaxed and confident that things would go as planned. Jessica took all of our stress away so we could focus on the most important things - spending our day uninterrupted and having the time of our lives! We'd highly recommend Jessica and Castle Ever After Events to anyone looking for a smooth and amazing wedding day! Thank you, Jessica!

I only wish I had hired Jessica and Tania sooner! These incredible women were not only lifesavers, but true problem-solvers, solution-finders, and calm-in-the-storm professionals. ...

From the very beginning, they went above and beyond—professional, kind, considerate, knowledgeable, friendly, and completely dedicated to making sure everything ran smoothly. I worked primarily with Jessica in the lead-up to my wedding day, and I genuinely don’t know what I would’ve done without her. When my florist turned out to be a total disaster, my watercolor artist canceled a week before the wedding, and—on the actual day—my ice sculpture broke, Jessica was on it. She handled every curveball with calm and confidence, keeping me grounded and stress-free. She didn’t just sympathize—she took action and got things done. Jessica made sure the florist provided clear instructions and accountability, sourced a replacement artist right away, and even secured a refund for the broken ice sculpture. Plus I decided within the last two weeks before my wedding day that I wanted custom drapery… they came through again and found me an amazing team that was able to do it on such short notice. When it came to getting a response, if I would send a message via text or email at any hour of the day she would respond instantly! Did I expect her to respond to an email I would send at midnight? No I expected her to respond the next day however I would literally see her working in the Google Docs and timelines that they provide you with their services as I’m working on them because they care that much !!! Bottom line: Jessica and Tania are the dream team you want by your side. If you’re considering working with them—stop thinking and do it. You’ll be so thankful you did!

I were completely overwhelmed and unfamiliar with the wedding process. When we found Jessica and Tania, they simplified everything and made the experience of planning digestible. They have an incredible array of resources, and make use of an extremely well laid-out website to organize the planning process. Jessica and Tania were always there to walk us through something when we were unsure. On our rehearsal and wedding days, we were able to relax and to enjoy ourselves because of how attentive and thoughtful Jessica and Tania were. A lot of our guests told us - emphatically - that ours was the best wedding that they had ever been to, and I don’t think they were just saying it to be nice! It’s thanks to Castle Ever After events that we had a more memorable, joyous, and loving wedding day than we ever imagined.

We can't say enough to describe how truly wonderful working with the team at Castle Ever After Events was. From our first interaction with Jessica and Tania, we knew they were just...

the right fit to help us bring our vision to life! They are thoughtful, thorough, supportive and collaborative. If we came forward with a question, they came back with not only recommendations taking into account our personal preferences, but multiple options. They handled planning changes with ease, helped calm our nerves when issues came up with vendor inquiries and did it all with grace. They were detailed in getting to know us, our preferences and ensuring that any communication was responded to in a timely fashion (and lots of encouragement!). On the day of our wedding, seeing them in the morning was like greeting old friends- and a big relief! Their energy was infectious, clipboards prepared with everything we'd sent over (and more!) and they handled every vendor interaction, timeline question or inquiry with ease. We truly felt so supported and cared for not just on our special day, but all the days leading up to it. We would gladly recommend their services to anyone (and have told everyone we know about them!) and hope that we cross paths again. The biggest and warmest "thank you" again to the team, you truly helped us celebrate in the best way, and we're forever grateful!

I first heard about Castle Ever After from a referral of the company who could not accommodate the day of our 20 year wedding anniversary, which speaks volume. Upon meeting Tania a...

nd Jessica they were extremely profesional and made the contractual agreement easy with their web portal customized to my vision. My personality type doesn’t allow anyone to have control, however, due to their wealth of experience in this arena, I was subdued after a few meetings with them and allowed for the first time ever, someone else do the work and not me. They were informative every step of the way and made decisions on my behalf understanding my likes and dislikes. One of their many value points worth mentioning is their heavy contacts in this industry. One of my requirements was to have a special band play in an area where no one would go. The week of the celebration they contracted the musical group and it made our day, one and only. Their support in handling the different vendors I had the day of the Celebration was flawless. They kept my wife and I on schedule and made sure we had breathing room from the guests subtly taking us aside, it truly was art in motion. We left our event late and they stayed making sure all vendors and venue were returned and contracts were fulfilled. I was so happy with their service I recommended them to all my friends and family. Lastly, let’s talk about their price for their service. In my opinion, they are below market value for this service, which is why I would hire them before they raise their cost. Their service is worth every penny and more. Thank you Tania and Jessica for making our 20th, a celebration to remember!

Crème de la Crème Coordinators! We worked with Tania and Jessica, of Castle Ever After for my daughter’s wedding in August. From our first phone call, I knew Tania and Jessica were...

the best fit. They had great energy and were very professional. The weeks leading up to the wedding, they helped alleviate so much stress, helping to finalize the details and handling all of the paperwork needed. On the day of, Castle Ever After made sure everyone was on track which helped us be at ease and truly enjoy the day. Outside of working with our vendors, they always made it a point to check on my daughter (the bride) to ensure she was OK, even going as far as making sure she ate through the morning. The night went seamlessly! I would work with Castle Ever After again for my other daughters weddings in a heartbeat!

tatement!! Jessica is such a beautiful person inside and out and she was made for the wedding business! She was always one step ahead, making sure everything was exactly the way it needed to be, and her response whenever I asked her for a favor was, “don’t worry, I’m on it.” As the bride, I can tell you I did not worry once the entire day, and our wedding was incredible beyond my wildest dreams. Her and I also got it off immediately having a ton of things in common, and I’m so grateful to say I’ve found a new friend on my wedding day as well! If you are considering Castle Ever After, it will easily be one of the best decisions you could make to ensure your special day will be perfect!!!
