videographer, Al were very professional and attentive. My now husband and I are not people who take photos often or even know what poses to do, in fact we get quite awkward in front of the camera, but Al and Vincent really helped with coming up with poses for shots.

did a first look with my bridesmaids, father and my husband’s parents. We were in a big, open room and my husband was in the groomsman’s room but could see into the room I was in if the door opened. When I did a first look with his parents and they walked out of the room, our videographer immediately stepped between me and the door to make sure my husband didn’t see me too early. We couldn’t have asked for a better photographer or videographer!

I worked with a photographer (Cynthia) and Videographer (Jamy) from Eivan's for my wedding which took place on September 19,2021. I cannot speak more highly of the experience I had...

with them. From the onset I booked with Eivan's and I was asked to fill out documents highlighting what I was looking for in terms of style, moments to be captured, things important to me, etc. The team at Eivan's was incredibly easy to communicate with and promptly responses to all of my emails and phone calls and I was always kept in the loop. I was able to pay via monthly payment plan which made things easier for us financially as well. I found out I was matched with Cynthia and Jamy about a month before the wedding and had meetings with them prior to the event to let them know what I was looking for. They were so great! On the day of my event they were punctual, respectful, attentive to my needs, and overall just about everything I was looking for from my photo/video team. After the event the team at Eivan also checked in to make sure everything went well. Overall, 5 star experience. I am now waiting for the content, but I am very sure it will be incredible.

My husband and I got married in September 2021 and we used Eivan's for photo and video. We were both very pleased by both the videographer, Gabriel, and photographer, Wael, at they...

were very professional and super fun. They both were great with coming up with picture and video ideas and were great with directing us on what to do and how to pose. Eivan's as a company is great and they were so helpful along the way. I like that they sent out video and photo questionnaires and checklist for shots to take and what we were looking for. It was fun being able to choose music for our video. We are still currently waiting for our pictures and it's been 5 weeks since out wedding so thats the only down side is having to wait for the final product. All the reps I have spoken with have been very friendly and have answered all of our questions. Their pricing was really good too and I thought it was great they provided us with a payment plan, it helped out with other wedding expenses as well. I would highly recommend them to others looking for photo/video.

Truly enjoyed my experience with Eivan's Photo & Video. Robert was our videographer and he was incredible! He communicated prior to the wedding day to have a game plan, added ideas...

of his own and was flexible and professional. Milan and Julia were our photographers, Julia was incredible and had great ideas and made me feel comfortable. My dogs were in photos and they were patient and great at capturing moments. I only wished we had taken more pictures with guest during reception hour. I have not received my pictures yet, but hope they turned out great! A sneak peek would be nice for future couples so that they have something to look at while waiting for all the photos. I would recommend this company as they were great and affordable.

When researching photographers for our wedding, I came across an ad for Eivan's. Didn't know if I had really wanted to go with a big nationally branded company, but I'm sure glad ...

I did! Not only did they send me portfolios for 3 of their photographers so I could choose had the style I wanted, but they were able to give me some really good deals for bundling my engagement and wedding day pictures! I was able to save about 2000$ with them after looking around and pricing different people.

The customer service department is efficient to work with as they provide information on various packages to fit your budget. You select from a range of photographers and then Eivan’s selects the final photographer from one of your choices. We showed Ivy inspiration photos of the types of photos we’d like captured but entrusted in her skills with capturing our highlighted moments of our big day.

Everytime my girls or family would say “this is a perfect shot” both Alex and Cecil were right there all ready for action. They both came up with great ideas for pictures.

They usually get back to me a few hours later which I thought was impressive. I thought it would take a day or two but nope! They found me another photographer due to the postponement. The photographer turned out amazing. She was on time, nice and very professional. She had a lot of ideas which I loved but most importantly she was listening to what we wanted so that was great. Honestly the package was very affordable and I am so thankful because weddings are expensive! I highly recommend Eivan's!

Eivans was a great company to hire through for our wedding day. Once we were assigned our contacts, our videographer and photographer kept constant communication with us leading up...

to our wedding day. Our photographer, Ina, did an amazing job to get the best shots while still helping my husband and I be comfortable in front of the camera. She directed us on what to do all night and that made it so much easier for us since we aren’t typically picture people. Our videographer, Lee, did an amazing job to catch all the small details and make sure we had all the content available to put into our video. They were both punctual and very communicative during the entire process, and would recommend to others looking for an affordable vendor! Only complaint is the lead time for getting pictures and videos back after the wedding, but i understand that is typical in this kind of business,

They asked us for ideas beforehand and shared their portfolios of their previous work. We were glad to see and use some of the original poses and they were glad to use some of the ones we came up with as well. Overall for the price, quality, and service it was the best and only option!

They were so sweet in reassuring us that everything’s okay and not to stress out, and that we’re doing great. Before leaving, they let us know how much time we had left and if we had any last minute requests. Eivan’s customer service was also responsive from start to finish, reminding us of any forms to fill out and any questions we had after the wedding, like when to expect pictures and videos, etc. Everything was so easy and laid out nicely, I highly recommend this company, especially if you have a short time to plan a wedding.

nd the right pricing for the right services. However, after searching high and low we found Eivan's Photo. Everything was custom to you even if you wanted to edit the preset packages a bit (I recommend the Expressions Package personally). They have a ton of different promotions that save you time and money and they have photography and videography in the same place! Not only were they responsive, patient, understanding, and flexible, they also sent us Alex Kim and Dariush N. to be our photographer and videographer. Those two were amazing and they worked with us during a quarantine wedding (COVID Wedding in Style). Alex even found my missing earring before I went out to the ceremony (I didn't have to sacrifice my something old)! The other positive was their professionalism during this pandemic, Dariush and Alex both wore masks and maintain the proper safety measures while at the wedding without sacrificing the shots and Eivan's Photo was able to reschedule our wedding day twice at the last minute! If I had to choose my favorite wedding vendor it would 100% be Eivan's Photo and I would use them again without question!

READ THE YELP REVIEWS BEFORE USING THIS COMPANY. Used Eivan's because they were so much more affordable that others. Unfortunately I'm disappointed in my choice and should have jus...

t paid more. Our wedding was in July, we had asked for some specific photos when we first hired Eivans. Day of the even the photographer showed and slightly wanted to take over. There were a few times that we had to explain what we wanted. Overall I feel there could have been a lot more photos of the important stuff like the wedding party as a whole or the bride with her kids, the groom with his new kids, more photos of the bride and groom together in general. We of course did not realize so many photos were just not taken until about 5 or so weeks after the event. And when the photos became available not all were there. We were missing a noticeable amount. Another 2-3 weeks later and several calls and emails they finally found the missing photos and uploaded them. Now here is the thing that is not told to you when you sign with them... your photos will be made available online with a watermark on every photo until your 90 day viewing period is over. So since they messed up and didn't have all our photos available they said they would extend the viewing... ughh now I have to wait even longer till I can download them. Their customer service sucks, they tell u things are being worked on but they seems to only read a screen then u need to call back for hopefully a response. Oh also they send a questionnaire after your event and it states To complete the questionnaire asap to help them expedite the processing of your package. I did this and apparently if they don't like your answers I get an email from Helen . We ended up speaking to Helen about a week ago and she basically was asking about what our issues were. Then she told us they would waive the expediting fee of $560. And the photos would be made available to download without the water mark. We just had to sign a document and we had to do it in a week or the offer expires. The document states you can not leave a negative review anywhere about eivans, not u, not ur family, not ur friends and your accepting the offer of that fee being waived. If you don't sign it, u have to wait for your photos. We did not sign it. I feel it's more important that other potential customers know how this company does things. Of course they have great reviews on the knot.... because they have people sign a legal document stating they won't say anything bad or they can be sued. Our wedding was in July, we just got access to our photos this week. I am truly disappointed with the company.I hope this review helps future potential clients to think about what they are getting into. I would have paid double the price to not deal with the stress this company caused. *** Helen... if that's your real name .. we spoke and you offered to waive a fee for our photos... u never said we would have to waive our right to honestly review your company. There's nothing further for you to do since we finally received our downloads. But seriously I would never recommend your company after going through what we did. I hope this review and all the other honest reviews help future clients to re think using your company. A day that was to be memorable and great and eivans ruined a portion because of the below average service.

I am sure that other photographers with this business were great and reading the reviews I thought mine would be too. Unfortunately, they were not.

I am sorely, sorely disappointed in this company. After reading so many praising reviews on this website I decided to take a chance on Eivan’s. The consultation with them started...

of great, they were both friendly and warm. They explained their packages to me and sent me a list of photographers that were available on my wedding date. After paying the deposit requested to view the portfolios for each of the photographers they offered, I made my selection and was assured that he was available to book. I then needed to fill out their long list of paperwork, through which I was continually locked out of and had to keep requesting to get a crees to almost daily. Once I I finished the paperwork, there was radio silence for a few weeks and then I’m informed that they have assigned a completely new photographer, one I have never heard of and who’s portfolio I had never seen without even being informed of the change or the reason why. I called both their events coordination number and their apparently berry separate sales division and was informed that I was not allowed to pick my photographer, but that one was assigned to me. You can imagine my surprise in being informed of this as their representative who I had spoken to on the phone repeatedly never explained to me that by looking through the portfolio’s offered to me I was really creating a “wish” list of the photographer I wanted. When I called to get clarification from them, they told me in no uncertain terms that it is not their policy to let me choose my photographer, but that they assigned one to me based on what they thought I wanted based on a very generic survey I filled out about wanting pictures with my family and who. Apparently I don’t need to have an opinion or idea of what I want as I was told that they knew better. I have been both insulted and left feeling helpless in a situation that should have been easy and fun. I am also dismayed to learn that the knot is promoting a company that would treat it’s client’s so harshly and would bait and switch them so callously. Please be warned that if you hire this company, you need to be very specific when dealing with them.
