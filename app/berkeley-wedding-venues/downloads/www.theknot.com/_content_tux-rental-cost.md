## How Much Does a Tux Rental Cost?

So, how much is it to rent a tux for a wedding? According to data from [The Knot 2025 Real Weddings Study](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-data-insights/real-weddings-study), the average cost for a male partner to rent ceremony attire is $205. While this is a great baseline to keep in mind, it's important to note that this number refers to a range of attire types—think everything from suits to custom tuxedos. Many major tux rental retailers, like The Black Tux and Men's Wearhouse, come in at $150 as their average price for a tuxedo rental. Depending on the type of tux and the potential addition of accessories, to-be-weds can generally expect tux rental costs to fall between $150 and $300. 

FEATURED VIDEO FROM THE KNOT

Even on the higher end, renting your [wedding tuxedo](https://www.theknot.com/fashion/tuxedos) instead of buying it can save you quite a bit. "Our customers are renting fully canvassed, fine wool tuxedos that would typically cost at least $1,500 to buy at retail—all at a comparable price to the fused construction and synthetic fabrics that you'll often find in tux shops," Sroat says.

Want to save time as well as money? [Free home try-on](https://the-black-tux.sjv.io/c/64733/1498278/17671?subId1=TK-tux-rental-cost&u=https%3A%2F%2Ftheblacktux.com%2Fhome-try-on) services ensure you're getting both the style and fit you want right out of the gate. Additionally, if you plan on renting a tuxedo for your own wedding, our free, easy-to-use [wedding budget tool](https://www.theknot.com/wedding-budget) is a great way to explore and compare wedding costs in your area.

## Tuxedo Rental Cost Factors

Wondering what contributes to the higher cost of renting [tuxedos vs. suits](https://www.theknot.com/content/tuxedo-vs-suit)? According to Sroat, the price difference is mainly due to the additional materials and the labor required to construct a tux. While suits are usually made with one fabric, tuxes are usually designed with additional luxury fabrics to add eye-catching details. "Tuxedos use satin accents in the design—typically on the lapels, the waistband and the outseam of the pants, but sometimes on the breast pocket, button coverings and pockets too," Sroat says.

And while there are plenty of ways to accessorize a suit, a tuxedo has even more. "This could include button studs for the shirt, cufflinks and a cummerbund," Sroat says. "A lot of those details are within your control, but can be an added cost."

## Why Does the Cost of Tuxedo Rentals Vary?

There are a number of reasons rental costs can vary from tux to tux, including customizations, materials and additional fees. Ahead, we're giving you the scoop on each, including how they impact your total spend.

### Accessories

One of the biggest factors when it comes to how much it costs to rent a tux? Extra accessories, as there are endless ways to make your look feel unique to you. Smaller additions like cufflinks, button studs, pocket squares and cummerbunds can add around $10 to $15 each to your rental cost, while larger additions like vests and shoes fall at the higher end of around $30 each.

While these additions can add up, you certainly don't need _all_ of them. You can also purchase them if you'd prefer to spend your money on accessories you'll get to keep. Regardless of which you choose, even a few small touches can make a big difference. "Don't skip accessories like socks and cuff links—they're the details that complete a tuxedo and will help you stand out," Sroat says. "For the cost of a cup of coffee, you can allow your personality to shine through with a fun pocket square or a unique, colorful tie."

### Materials

Your cost to rent a tuxedo can also vary greatly depending on the materials the garment is made with. "In addition to wool, which is the gold standard of tuxedo fabrics, we offer options with more delicate and costly fabrics," Sroat says.

More [affordable tuxedos](https://www.theknot.com/content/budget-friendly-tuxedos) are typically made with synthetic fabrics, like polyester or rayon, while tuxedos on the higher-priced side are often crafted from luxurious materials like cashmere, silk and velvet.

For example, Men's Wearhouse's [Egara Charcoal Gray Jacquard Dinner Jacket Tux](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=9ibcrDa*U1o&mid=41420&murl=https%3A%2F%2Ftuxedo.menswearhouse.com%2Fcharcoal-gray-dinner-jacket-tuxedo-egara-id-5343&u1=tk-tux-rental-cost&LSNSUBSITE=LSNSUBSITE), made of 100% polyester, starts at $159 to rent. On the other hand, the [BLACK by Vera Wang Black Peak Lapel Tux](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=9ibcrDa*U1o&mid=41420&murl=https%3A%2F%2Ftuxedo.menswearhouse.com%2Fblack-peak-lapel-tuxedo-vera-wang-id-5339&u1=tk-tux-rental-cost&LSNSUBSITE=LSNSUBSITE), made of 100% super 130's wool, starts a bit higher at $179.

### Additional Fees

According to Tighe, additional fees are common in the tux rental world. At Men's Wearhouse, tux rental prices include taxes and a $12 damage and handling fee applied at checkout, ensuring you're covered should any minor wear and tear occur during your rental period. At The Black Tux, additional fees look similar. "In addition to mitigating normal wear and tear to our garments, our flat $12 fee covers in-house dry cleaning and the cost of labor to restock garments," Sroat says.

It's important to note that other retailers may have different terms and conditions when it comes to additional fees. Keep an eye out for phrases like "damage waiver" or "rental insurance," as these are signs that additional fees will apply.
