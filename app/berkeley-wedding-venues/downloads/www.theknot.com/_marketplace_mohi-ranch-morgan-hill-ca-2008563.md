My husband and I got married at MOHI Ranch in September and absolutely loved our experience! From start to finish the staff was incredible and made wedding planning so much easier ...

than we ever could have dreamed! We knew going into planning that we preferred an all inclusive wedding venue, and we absolutely made the right choice with MOHI. Both Jennifer and then Adrianna (property managers) were so nice and accommodating. They were able to accommodate our sake opening ceremony, which was something we really wanted to have at our wedding. And the all inclusive aspect was so nice. We didn’t have to worry about finding a florist, caterer or DJ, and the MOHI ones absolutely delivered. Our flowers and design elements were straight out of my dreams, the catering was awesome - we got so many compliments on the food! - and the DJ kept the dance floor going all night. The venue is gorgeous and we loved it from the moment that we toured. Even though we toured in January when the vines were bare, the obvious beauty of the venue was so apparent. My husband loved that there were three different locations on property so that our wedding ceremony, cocktail hour and reception would feel like three distinct events. And the day of our wedding was perfect! Our day of coordinator, Danika Del Monte, was AMAZING! She was on top of everything and handled everything perfectly. If there were any issues, I did not hear about them. We got several comments about how on top of it our day of coordinator was as well. I never felt stressed at all, and I definitely attribute some of that to Danika and the facilities manager Eduardo, who was also great. Overall, we had an amazing wedding – it was everything that we wanted it to be. We couldn’t be happier with MOHI throughout the entire process and would 10/10 recommend them!

We had a beautiful wedding this summer thanks to our amazing lead coordinator, Danika, Eduardo, our Facility Manager, and team. Danika took over as our lead after another coor...

dinator left. She was eager to help our vision come to life and offered us resources that we didn’t even know were available to us. She is sharp, efficient, warm and a problem solver. During the wedding she took incredible care of my husband and I, making sure we were fed and hydrated during the August heat wave. She helped to drive my mom around who had injured her knee, on top of being lead coordinator. Her smile and her responding to my requests with “you got it” took off so much pressure during our big day. We were able to actually be present and enjoy our wedding, and I believe a great deal is due to her and the team. We are so grateful to her. Highlights: The food was a hit. We received endless compliments on how good the food was. Many said it was one of the top, if not the best food they had had at a wedding. This was really important to us because if there is tasty food, the guests are happy. We had a multicultural group and the food scored high across the board. We ordered from the highest tier and it was totally worth it. We chose MOHi’s sparking Rose for our champagne and it was also a hit. The venue is beautiful. It had over 3 distinct areas, which offered variety and intimacy. Most of the place is covered in twinkle lights which makes the place even more magical in the evening. They also have misters to help stay cool during cocktail hour. FYI you pay for the twinkle lights but again I think it’s worth it. MOHI Ranch has a well oiled machine. The wedding was seamless. The decorators, Luxe Leal, know what they are doing. Our coordinator Savannah got a great sense of our theme right away. She was prepared, professional and also really wonderful to work with. Considerations: DJ is in house. I would have liked to interview my DJ directly as music is really important to me to make sure I got a good sense of what their music style was before hand. Decorations have to go through their third vendor. No outside flowers are allowed and there is a very limited list of things you can bring. This is something to consider if you’re looking to budget and do your own center pieces or accents. Otherwise, you will love having your wedding here!

From the moment we first toured MOHI Ranch, we knew we had found the perfect venue for our wedding day. Looking back, we can honestly say that the entire experience, from initial p...

lanning to the final send-off, exceeded every expectation. The setting itself is simply magical. We had our ceremony in the vineyard with the olive tree aisle and it was perfect. Even in early November, the vines were lush with slight Fall tones. The outdoor reception under the olive trees and lights felt like a scene from a movie—it’s naturally gorgeous and requires very little added decor. As the sun set, the entire winery transformed under the twinkling bistro lights. This feature alone creates such a romantic and special atmosphere that guests are still raving about. A massive part of our success was our coordinator, Danika. She was absolutely fantastic! Danika walked us through the entire process with expertise, kept us perfectly on track with our timeline, and answered every single one of our questions (no matter how small or frequent). The planning process was seamless, enhanced by the specialized services MOHI provides. We were thrilled to use the design service through Lux Designs, which helped us finalize our vision for decor. The tasting menu experience was also wonderful, allowing us to confidently choose our menu while enjoying a date night out. The food was fantastic! We received countless compliments from our guests, who told us how much they enjoyed every dish. The quality and presentation were superb, and there was plenty for everyone. If you are looking for a venue that combines natural elegance, exceptional service, and delicious catering, look no further than MOHI Ranch. They gave us the most special and memorable day of our lives!

She made sure we always had drinks, actually ate, and stayed on schedule without ever feeling rushed.

re everything ran smoothly, she was on top of things before we even had to ask. For our 50-person wedding, the space was perfect. The vibe felt intimate even though it’s a large space, and having our date in September ended up being the best choice. It wasn’t too hot, and the vineyard looked gorgeous, right in harvest season, with the grapes looking beautiful in the background. They have a farm you can take photos on as well, with sunflowers and such. The food was even better than we expected!! It was better than during the trial and we got many compliments on it after, especially the anppetizers, the wine of course, and the mashed potatoes, and the décor through Luxe came out amazing. It was not cheap but in the end, totally worth it for how everything looked. Everything felt very catered to us and what we wanted. We added a beautiful chuppah to their wooden frame for an extra price and it was very grandiose and elegant. We went with the least expensive options for almost everything and it turned out looking nicer than most wedding I’ve been to.. The wooden grooms house (which we had open to all out close friends) and the bridal room were really lovely too—great for the bride getting ready, though not quite big enough for the whole bridal party. The only downside is that the night had to wrap up at 10, which we wish could’ve gone later. But honestly, even with that, they were super accommodating, and we still ended up having the best day ever. All in all, beautiful venue, great people, and such a memorable day. Would 100% recommend.

There wasn't a single hitch throughout the entire day, which speaks volumes about her organizational skills and attention to detail. The venue itself is stunning—both the outdoor ceremony space and indoor reception areas were exactly as pictured and even more beautiful in person. Eduardo did an excellent job ensuring the facility was in perfect condition and that each part of our wedding (ceremony, reception, dinner, dancing) had the right setup and atmosphere. The MOHI Ranch team was also very accommodating with all our requests and flexible with the various elements we wanted to incorporate into our day. The food and drinks were excellent as well.

ue. The outside area was GORGEOUS. From the huge LOVE letters, to the olive trees, vineyard, barrel room and stringed lights, everything was PERFECT. We not only loved all of their wine, but we also appreciated all of their wedding packages. They have a whole team who design, coordinate, cook, bartend and DJ/MC. It made wedding planning so much easier. MOHI also has an online portal which helps you communicate with the whole team. We were debating on hiring a month of wedding planner to help, but after our final consultation, Christina, our day of coordinator reassured me that everything will be ok! SHE WAS SO RIGHT. It's been almost 2 weeks and my husband still mentions randomly how much the MOHI team (especially Christina and Jacy) helped us! Christina guided us through the rehearsal when the weather was extremely cold and started pouring - yet continued to encourage everyone to practice one more time. We also brought all of our extra decorations in large boxes the day before and the Deluxe Design Decor team set everything up so beautifully! Wedding Day - we were greeted upon arrival by Christina and Jacy. We didn't have to worry about anything. They made sure that we were well taken care of - appetizers, drinks AND dinner. My husband really appreciated how they would ask us about our bar limit and if we would like to raise it. He loved how they had their honest opinions and gave him advice - especially since we were so in the moment. They checked in with all of our vendors - photographer, videographer, photobooth, DJ, and desserts. The MOHI staff was so wonderful, we can't recommend them enough. Overall, it was the best experience and will be our most favorite day. Thanks MOHI.

rfect place for our special day. The team at MoHi, especially Christina, provided exceptional service from day one. I can't emphasize enough how stress-free the day felt for us because she was so on top of everything! Christina guided us through every step, ensuring that our wedding day was everything we dreamed of. Her attention to detail, personal touch, and genuinely fun personality made us feel valued and taken care of throughout the process. Day-of, she went above and beyond--including bringing chairs and waters during our wedding party photos, reserving ceremony chairs on short notice, driving the golf cart for transportation, delivering plates to tables, and inviting us to an after-party downtown! The venue itself is nothing short of breathtaking. The beautiful outdoor setting against the quiet hills and vineyard created a romantic ambiance, perfect for a wedding! The long aisle down the corridor of olive trees is gorgeous for any bride and bridal party to make their way down. The cocktail hour on the patio is great for entertaining with spaces for sun, shade, games, and personal touches. The barrel room for the reception is just as beautiful- with the twinkly lights and modern light fixtures. We added a photobooth, dessert table, 15 tables, plus a sweetheart table and nothing felt too tight. "Stunning" was a compliment we kept hearing from guests. If you get married here, you'll work with Design Deluxe Decor for everything related to floral and table decor. Now let's talk about the food. The culinary experience at MoHi Wine was outstanding. The vegetable risotto was a particular hit. The menu offered a great variety, including accommodations for dairy free, gluten free, and vegetarian. And we appreciated the grand testing a few months before where we had huge portions to sample the appetizers, drinks, and courses. The quality of the food--along with the attentive staff who tried to get food out as efficiently as they could--was impressive, especially for 160 guests. Last but not least, the party was off the charts, thanks to the incredible DJ Darren. He sent us a very thorough questionnaire ahead of time so we had full trust that we were on the same page. He knew exactly how to keep the energy high and the dance floor packed, was flexible with timeline changes, and had everyone (from 2 year olds to 90 year olds) grooving. As far as critiques, I would say that I wished the barrel room bathrooms were located in a different area because they did crowd. Though available and open, the outdoor portables were underutilized and too far away. I also wish the bridal suite was larger because it's not a place where anyone can truly get ready in. More of a touchdown area with AC (a plus!) which the bridal party used pre-ceremony. I heard this is on their remodel list. If you're looking for a remarkable wedding venue, look no further than MoHi Winery. The exceptional team, led by Christina, will go above and beyond to make your day truly special. With a beautiful venue, delectable food, and an amazing party atmosphere, MoHi Winery is the perfect choice for an unforgettable wedding experience.

This venue checked all of the boxes for us but what we were just so impressed by was how responsive they were, how knowledgeable they were, how seamless the whole process was and, ...

even on the day of the wedding (hottest day in April at 90 degrees), they ensured my husband and I were always hydrated and coordinated everything to the T! I cannot stop raving about this venue and no doubt I would recommend them to my closest friends getting married soon. One more thing we LOVED and made this venue stand out was how all-inclusive it was, from venue, to catering, to drinks, to service, to decor! It made it so easy for us and we knew exactly our budget going in to it.

was seamless. Our provided coordinator was timely and helped to address any issues as they came up. I couldn’t have imagined a better venue for the amount we paid.

The Horn blower worked effectively! Polly was our occasion facilitator and she was astounding! She was astounding from the very first moment and rushed to answer messages or calls....

She was even there to assist me with preparing just before I strolled down the walkway. The staff and team were perfect on the yacht and the visitors said it was all an astounding wedding.

I was totally impressed by the 'flow' it offers to wedding guests starting with ample parking, very cute getting ready spaces, modern and chic outdoor spaces/view, and an incredibly spacious main building for a romantic dinner and dancing. I had such a great experience at MOHI and was overwhelmed with how much love Christina and her team gives both wedding couples and guests alike. I will be back!

We chose MOHI wine for of 60 adults and 20 children, but it can certainly accommodate up to 200+. It was the perfect destination for our family and friends to enjoy the grounds, ha...

ve the children run around, and view the beautiful scenery. Unlike many wineries, it is convenient to have the ceremony, cocktail, and dinner all in one central location, leaving more time to enjoy the festivities versus moving around a large venue. Plus, parking is a breeze. We planned the wedding within 2 months, and from NYC! Christina and Sarrah were super easy to work with and made our wedding dreams come true. It was fantastic to have food, decor, flowers, and a DJ all encompassed within the venue, making it way easier for us to get ready for our big day. We cannot say how beautiful the venue was, especially at sunset. We would highly recommend this place for your wedding.

They truly took care of us, accommodated a special surprise Armenian dancer my mom set up, and just treated us with utmost respect and excitement. The most stress-free wedding planning and wedding day ever thanks to the team at Mohi.

My husband and I got married at MOHI at Sycamore Creek two weeks ago and we are still riding the high. We knew after visiting the venue that it was the place for us. After talking ...

to Jennifer, we knew we would be taken care of the space was just so beautiful. We loved how open it was as we had a lot of kids at our wedding and it was important for them to have a space to run around. The ceremony aisle was just a dream, twinkling olive trees surrounding a beautiful cement aisle. The cement and Olive trees gave me a Restoration Hardware vibe. We loved that after going to the ceremony space in between the vineyards, guests went to the cocktail hour in a fun and beautiful outdoor space and then into the barrel room for dinner/dancing. The crew at MOHI is also just phenomenal. They were so on top of everything. They responded so quickly to all of my questions and not a thing went wrong on our wedding day. We are so grateful to Sarrah, DJ Darren, Christina, Jennifer, Gavin, Jacob, Angie, Nicole and many more for making our dream day come true. Also.....the food and wine.....is SO GOOD. I highly recommend doing family style and we LOVED the chicken and braised beef short ribs. We cannot wait to go back to MOHI for wine tasting to reminisce.

ything about Sycamore even after having to push out our wedding due to COVID, I knew that there just wasn't another venue that would fit the style my husband and I were going for within our budget. The coordinators were absolutely amazing as well! Shout out to Jen and Tiffany because I could not have done it at all without them. They made planning a wedding enjoyable for me and nothing was impossible. The fact that this was basically almost a one stop shop made it even better! I love how they were all inclusive venue which made planning less stressful. If I could relive and do it all again, I would and I would definitely choose Sycamore again!

Fantastic, Fantastic, FANTASTIC!!! I don't think my review will do them justice, but I'll try :) First, we booked with MOHI wayyy before covid and they have handled this situatio...

n extremely well. We know plenty of couples who had difficult venues/vendors and MOHI did a great job managing a difficult situation. Second, 3 years after booking with MOHI, we were still absolutely blown away with their service level, professionalism, and organization. Every guest, including our parents, commented how beautiful the venue looked and perfectly the day went. Every outside vendor shared that they felt supported and comfortable working with the venue. We were originally concerned that using MOHI's services would prevent us from having flexibility of selecting our own DJ, floral style, food, alcohol, photo booth, etc. but MOHI made every vision come true and blew us away. They were able to support some of our crazy requests: can we bring our dog? can we take a giant group picture? can we have family style meals? can we bring a photo booth on site that's actually a VW bus? YES! They brought special touches to the day: our guests were OBSESSED with the provided parisols (lol!) and made suggestions where they thought we could crank it up (glow sticks anyone?). To the staff including day-of coordinator, DJ, florist, bakery, food/bev staff absolutely exceeded our expectations, thank you!!!. If you're an engaged couple thinking about booking MOHI, do it!

I felt as though she was a friend, not just our coordinator. She kept everyone on track and on time! She was there to guide us every step of the way. I highly reccomend this winery if you're looking for an intimate place to hold your wedding! They have everything available! I can hardly wait to go back to just relax and have some wine.

AMAZING experience! I would recommend MOHI to any bride looking for a venue near the Morgan Hill, CA area. Nothing having to do with wedding planning is stress-FREE, but let me tel...

l you, the coordinators, design team, and all the other vendors involved did everything in their power to take stress off my hands and handled it internally. Something unique about this venue is that all vendors (coordinators, design, decoration, DJ, food, alcohol, insurance, dessert, floral... everything needed to plan a wedding besides photography, videography, hair and make-up) is all through a company called Live Love Leal. I was involved in all decision making, but once they knew my preferences, they would handle and execute from there. All people involved were very professional, personable, and responsible. I got everything I wanted and MORE. Our receptions was planned to be outside and of course it ended up being on one of the hottest days of the summer and the morning of the wedding, the MOHI team ordered water misters and installed them (so nice (!!), and I didn't even have to ask). The food portions were the largest I've ever seen at a wedding. We even had guys tell us that they were full after dinner. The facility is just awesome in itself. There was a space for the entire bridal party to get ready, huge air conditioned tasting room, bocce ball courts, and a beautiful ceremony space! I would 10/10 recommend this venue. If I could do my wedding over, I wouldn't change one thing (well, maybe the heat). If you are lucky enough to work with Nicole from the Design team, you are in good hands! She does amazing work. I showed her a picture of my dream bouquet and based of that we were able to create our entire theme and color scheme. She had really good ideas and suggestions when I wasn't sure what to do or which direction to go. If you are lucky enough to have Alex as your Coordinator, you better thank your lucky stars. She is incredible and you can trust her with anything and everything. When I thought I had crazy or outrageous ideas, she never made me feel crazy or outrageous and would listen. She was just phenomenal. She was able to get us, the entire wedding party, and all our attendants through different stages of the evening seamlessly. I have no doubt that if you choose MOHI for your wedding venue, you will not regret it.

enjoy the day! I am a planner myself and was worried I'd have to do all of the logistics, follow up, and really guide the coordinators to see my vision - that was not the case. Alex was so good at giving honest feedback, clarity on what she needed, and staying on top of our timeline - I literally was able to bring my 2 rubbermaid bins of table decorations and personal items the day before and show up to the most beautiful wedding the next day. The food was way better than I expected - the tasting event had my hopes low but the meals were so good!! The wine is good, we had a live band and the DJ and they were really accommodating. We booked shuttles for our guests and it was so worth the money. I honestly felt this was the best day and a lot of it had to do with the venue and support staff - I mean they met us after we walked down the aisle with appetizers and champagne!! Highly recommend - we had 112 guests and it was reasonable for what you get - hard to find anything with this level of quality, ease, and beauty in the Bay Area for a better price.

I've probably spent the past 2 months following our late August wedding talking up Sycamore Creek Vineyards to anyone that wants to listen. What a flawless, amazing, and all-around...

incredible experience. We found Sycamore Creek Vineyards in March of this year and instantly fell in love. Jennifer was so sweet and kind, and I instantly felt like we had found somewhere super special. The venue is beautiful, (and we saw it on a day where the vines were bare and it was pouring rain), but modern and rustic at the same time. I grew up in the bay area so it was a perfect spot for all our friends and family to gather. We were hoping to get married sometime this Fall, but knew that it would be hard to find the perfect venue with our tight schedule. When we went to put down our deposit we discovered a Saturday in August was available and we spontaneously decided that despite the even speedier time frame for a wedding, that we LOVED the idea of getting married in August. Our parents had both been married that month so it seemed extra special. Sycamore Creek was unbelievably accommodating and thoughtful throughout the entire process. They immediately got us into a tasting to pick out food and dessert for the big day. We met really quickly with the Deluxe + Design + Decor team to go over our visions for floral arrangements, table settings, and other decor. Everyone was very understanding of our budget and helped us cut costs if we needed to. Overall, we both truly felt that things were smooth, flawless, and relatively stress-free. We even hosted our rehearsal dinner at Sycamore Creek the night before our big day, which I thought was really special. We served pizza at the rehearsal from their outdoor pizza oven and it was a great chance for people to meet and greet since the big day gets so hectic. So many guests commented on what a beautiful venue it was, how tasty the food and wine were on both days (which I don't think is a very common wedding compliment), how kind and helpful Jennifer and Alex were, the gorgeous table settings and of course beautiful floral arrangements ( so breathtaking - I cried when I saw all the flowers for the first time!!). I honestly could go on and on and on. I stressed for a little while right after we had decided on an August wedding. Five months wasn't a ton of time to plan. But I honestly felt like I would make that decision all over again because it ended up being so flawless and smooth - I was beyond impressed. Jennifer and Alex went absolutely above and beyond coordinating with us for weeks leading up to the wedding, being flexible with our plans, helping with the smallest to the largest details. They are incredibly talented at what they do, and genuinely nice people on top of that! The day went by in the blink of an eye, but everything ended up being perfect and beyond our wildest dreams. When it was all said and done and we waved goodbye to our guests that night my husband said, "I didn't realize that I could love and enjoy our wedding as much as I did." He'd always heard that it's a crazy, painful planning experience and that the bride and groom hardly have a second to breath and enjoy it. Sycamore Creek Vineyards proved all of his fears wrong and I think we both agree that we would not have done anything differently. We are beyond thankful to this INCREDIBLE team. They made our wildest dreams come true and then some!

When it came to the actual wedding day, SCV and their staff managed all the major and minor details so that we could soak in the magic of the day. They coordinated with all the vendors so that everyone was on the same page and our agenda was followed. The premises are beautiful and our guests couldn't stop commenting about what a perfect location it was for a California wedding! We would 10/10 recommend booking your wedding at Sycamore Creek!
