![Romantic Curls With Fishtail Braid and Barrette](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/d0cda8d7-a2e7-4ca0-9fc6-ff28e96d5f86~rs_768.h-cr_45.0.1395.1800)

_[Photo: Courtesy of Tress Art by Serena](https://www.tressarthair.com/)_

If you can't decide between wearing your hair up or down, try meeting somewhere in the middle. For this look, hairstylist [Serena Hampton Yates](https://www.tressarthair.com/) topped romantic, voluminous curls with a bold barrette on one side and a fishtail braid on the other.

### 3\. Half-Up, Half-Down Box Braids

![Half-Up, Half-Down Box Braids](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/49185b2d-c6f0-4bab-a2a5-b900b0a2e325~rs_768.h-cr_0.90.1080.1530)

_[Photo: Derek Bedwell Photography](https://derekbedwellphotography.mypixieset.com/),__[Hair: Toya the Hair Doctor](https://www.instagram.com/toyathehairdoctor/?hl=en)_

One of our favorite takes on box braid styles for weddings is a half-up, half-down look. Simple and timeless, it's ideal for the bride who wants a minimalist vibe. Plus, it'll ensure your hair stays out of your face should there be some wind on the wedding day.

### 4\. Bold Box Braid Top Knot

![Bold Box Braid Top Knot](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/0ec4cb43-b844-43b4-a2cb-3c9358f602ea~rs_768.h-cr_12.0.822.1080)

It doesn't get more glam than the bold box braid updo Charity Lawson sported for her wedding shoot with Dotun Olubeko. This Black braided wedding hairstyle is perfect for brides who want to let a pair of sparkling statement earrings shine.

### 5\. Intricate Braided Updo With Sparkling Barrette

![Intricate Braided Updo With Sparkling Barrette](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/249bada4-c2e1-429c-9fd9-98279cf6193f~rs_768.h-cr_35.0.1045.1346)

_[Photo: Joshua Dwain](https://www.joshuadwain.com/),__[Hair: Hair by Sadiku](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/hair-by-sadiku-new-york-ny-752540)_

Intricate wedding braid updo Black hairstyles leave plenty of room for over-the-top bridal accessories like this striking, sparkling barrette. Plus, it's the ideal choice for a dress with wow-worthy details like an open back and beautiful hand beading.

### Find your kind of venue

From barns to ballrooms, discover reception venues that feel like you.

### 6\. Afro With Braided Sides and Barrette

![Afro With Braided Sides and Barrette](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/a84aad3e-54d6-4ff7-9039-f00c8df38239~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1449.1932)

_[Photo: Gabriel Conover Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/gabriel-conover-photography-spring-valley-ca-1039469)_

If you want to keep things low-maintenance and let your natural texture shine, opt for an afro with a subtle, sparkling twist—think a braided side part topped with a glistening, embellished barrette that perfectly complements a strapless beaded wedding dress.

### 7\. Low Bun With Braid Crown and Face-Framing Curls

![Low Bun With Braid Crown and Face-Framing Curls](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/499880c0-9d72-4e47-b838-5f0895bfaaa9~rs_768.h-cr_68.0.1081.1350)

_[Photo: Whole Heart Studios](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/whole-heart-studios-arlington-va-970957),__[Hair: Tress Art by Serena](https://www.tressarthair.com/)_

If you like the look of a braid crown but don't necessarily want your hair _fully_ pulled back, add a few face-framing tendrils to your style. Simply leave out a few front and bottom strands and curl them in small sections for a romantic, wedding-worthy look.

### 8\. Long Loose Curls With Double-Wrapped Braids

![Long Loose Curls With Double-Wrapped Braids](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/0cb3c035-2e89-4a55-a45c-2c39f87e3bb2~rs_768.h-cr_0.208.2500.3541)

_[Photo: Angelika Johns Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/angelika-johns-photography-falls-church-va-970210),__[Hair: Tress Art by Serena](https://www.tressarthair.com/)_

Take the ethereal vibe of long, loose curls up a notch by topping them with a romantic double-wrapped braid. Not only is this look endlessly elegant, but it also ensures your hair will stay out of your face without the need for a full-on updo.

### 9\. Voluminous Bun With Knotless Braids

![Voluminous Bun With Knotless Braids](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/a8bdbeb4-ab0c-4d20-83f4-563ccc30b23e~rs_768.h-cr_68.0.1081.1350)

_[Photo: BLTF Productions](https://www.bltfproductions.com/),__[Hair: The Byron Marcelle Experience](https://www.thebmexp.com/)_

For a unique take on the classic bridal bun, hairstylist [Byron Marcelle](https://www.thebmexp.com/) took knotless braids and fastened them into a voluminous, eye-catching updo perfect for the high-fashion bride. Add an embellished [bridal hair accessory](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-hair-accessories) or two for a touch of sparkle.

### 10\. Sleek Low Braided Bun

![Sleek Low Braided Bun](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/f9ff64d4-96e5-49cd-932a-917ba74895ef~rs_768.h-cr_34.0.1047.1350)

_[Photo: Nativ Lens](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/nativ-lens-sanford-fl-2048622),__Hair: Dommie Cole_

Add texture and interest to a low sleek bun by putting your ponytail in a large braid before you twist it and secure it. This simple braided updo style for Black wedding hair is the perfect counterpart to a minimalist strapless gown.

### 11\. Long Sleek Side Braid

![Long Sleek Side Braid](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/a3eeae3f-400e-41f4-a708-696d6ef7de38~rs_768.h-cr_68.0.1081.1350)

_[Photo: BLTF Productions](https://www.bltfproductions.com/),__[Hair: The Byron Marcelle Experience](https://www.thebmexp.com/)_

Let the back of your dress steal the show and opt for an elegant braid you can pull to one side. This low-effort look could easily be twisted up into a bun later once it's time to hit the dance floor.

### 12\. Bold Braid Crown

![Bold Braid Crown](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/934cf33b-a25a-4369-8bff-3476c34e5b9b~rs_768.h-cr_0.473.3447.5069)

_[Photo: Jessica Christie Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/jessica-christie-photography-denver-co-605155)_

For a unique take on Black braided wedding hairstyles, forgo the traditional updo or bun and opt for a bold braid crown instead. No matter your wedding vibe or style, this eye-catching [trending wedding hairstyle](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-hair-trends) is sure to be remembered.

### 13\. Half-Up, Half-Down Loose Waves With Fishtail Braid

![Half-Up, Half-Down Loose Waves With Fishtail Braid](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/f5733639-f3f0-40b4-9f40-8c0f82af3e53~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1178.1571)

_[Photo: Courtesy of Dommie Cole](https://www.dommiecole.com/)_

It's hard to get more classic than loose waves when it comes to [Black wedding hairstyles](https://www.theknot.com/content/black-wedding-hairstyles), but styling them in a high, half-up, half-down look with a partial fishtail braid makes them feel instantly unique. It also means you get the best of both worlds—your hair stays down _and_ out of your face.

### 14\. Romantic Curls With Dutch Braids

![Romantic Curls With Dutch Braids](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/3c64ba41-b833-4d60-b761-9f91b4b6fc8d~rs_768.h-cr_135.0.945.1080)

Another take on soft bridal curls, Yates paired this look with a pretty Dutch braid on each side and face-framing strands at the front. This hairstyle lends itself well to accessories, but we love it with just a long, flowing wedding veil.

### 15\. Coily Puff With Tiny Braid

![Coily Puff With Tiny Braid](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/7ab99dcf-bb02-4288-bceb-4aa0bf1f08c8~rs_768.h-cr_70.0.1080.1346)

_[Photo: Chi-Chi Ari](https://chichiarilove.com/),__[Hair: Hair by Sadiku](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/hair-by-sadiku-new-york-ny-752540)_

Part sleek minimalism, part natural elegance. Channel both of these vibes with a slicked-back, coily puff topped with a small braid. Add a pearl-adorned headband to tie in your jewelry, or keep the look accessory-free for a more minimal feel.

### 16\. Updo With Braid Crown and Face-Framing Curls

![Updo With Braid Crown and Face-Framing Curls](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/c392694b-b5f2-468a-82e0-c3ff4f361bc6~rs_768.h-cr_39.0.849.1080)

A sleek updo goes from simple to statement-making when you add a Dutch braid crown, delicate face-framing curls and a glistening barrette. If you're craving the romantic vibe of curls but want to let your dress shine, this braided Black wedding hairstyle is a no-brainer.

### 17\. Bold Braided Updo With Headband

![Bold Braided Updo With Headband](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/4ee0727b-7885-4e53-a59b-92c39fb0524f~rs_768.h-cr_68.0.1081.1350)

_[Photo: Beloved Agency](https://www.belovedagency.com/y34hxo20qsk),__[Hair: Dommie Cole](https://www.dommiecole.com/)_

If bold and glamorous is what you're going for, look no further. For this high-fashion do, hairstylist [Dommie Cole](https://www.dommiecole.com/) fastened a voluminous braid to the top of the head and paired it with a feathery bridal headband that doubles as jewelry.

### 18\. Soft Low Bun With Loose Braid

![Soft Low Bun With Loose Braid](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/50a900ba-f92d-423c-8e84-5929e494a86d~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.620.827)

_[Photo: Courtesy of The Byron Marcelle Experience](https://www.thebmexp.com/)_

Braid crowns don't have to be tight. If you prefer a softer, subtler look, opt for a low updo with a loose braid down the sides and face-framing strands at the front for that "intentionally effortless" wedding day hair look.

## Tips for Choosing Braided Wedding Hairstyles From African American Stylists

Still feel stuck and don't know what direction to take your hairstyle? Look at these expert-backed tips to help you land a decision.

### Consider the Weather

According to Byron Marcelle of [The Byron Marcelle Experience](https://www.thebmexp.com/), one of the most important wedding hairstyle factors to consider is the weather. While soft waves with a small braid crown might work well when it's crisp and cool out, a full braid or braided updo will likely be a better choice if it's hot and humid. "One of my favorite tips to share with my brides in the summertime, especially in the South, is to go with an updo," Marcelle says. "Trying to fight heat, humidity, unexpected rain and the occasional breeze is a losing battle—and your hair will definitely lose every time," he adds. If you're unsure whether a hairstyle will work well with your hair type or texture, do a [hair trial](https://prep-for-hair-and-makeup-trial/) with your stylist to test the waters.

### Have Fun With It

Last but not least, [choose a wedding hairstyle](https://www.theknot.com/content/choosing-a-wedding-day-hairstyle) that feels like _you_. Whether your style leans simple and understated or over-the-top glam, there are so many African American braid hairstyle options to choose from. "A romantic French braid, a bold butterfly braid, a sleek underbraid—braids are the ultimate bridal hair accessory right now. They bring a timeless, playful twist to your look and help keep everything picture-perfect from 'I do' to the last dance," says Marcelle.
