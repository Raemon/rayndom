We made an appointment online and met with Katie. She was kind, friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable. She helped my niece pick out the perfect dress, which happened to be on sale, ...

and then added beautiful accessories; a rhinestone belt, a sparkling hair comb and a gorgeous veil. We also picked out earrings and will look at necklaces when she goes back for the fitting. It was a wonderful experience and we are thankful for Katie’s expert guidance and inventory knowledge.

The entire team at Blossoms Bridal made my wedding dress shopping experience exceptionally wonderful. I had went to 5 other shops before finding the wedding dress of my dreams here...

! Katie (the owner) listened attentively to the details and changes I wanted and got the necessary materials in quickly. Stefanie (who works at the shop) is so supportive and friendly, and the seamstress Raylinda did an amazing job with the alterations! Everyone there wants you to be satisfied and they went above and beyond that. I can't thank you all enough for bringing my vision to life, and I can't wait to wear my wedding dress on the most special day of my life!

Katie made sure to help me find my perfect dress by asking all the right questions and hand selecting each one she thought I would love. Katie made the whole experience better and I’m very thankful she was able to help me find my dream dress and it just so happened to be the first one I tried on! Definitely recommend blossoms to anyone in the search of a Formal or Bridal gown!

I found the dress I wanted in another store, however I had to come back to Katy to place the order since I felt a very personal touch to her approach. She has a lovely collection, great contacts and was able to secure my dress directly from the designer as it was the last available piece in inventory. I'm eager to get my hands on the dress in a few weeks. Hoping to do my alterations and accessories from here as well. Thanks Awesome Blossom Bridals

I tried on multiple dresses at different boutiques and each time I had tried on my wedding dress at other locations but I didn’t feel the hospitality from them so it didn’t feel ri...

ght to buy from them. I went to blossoms bridal because my best friend recommended them since she had purchased her dress from them. I was welcomed by Katie when I arrived and Katie brought many dresses to me to try on including the dress I kept loving and trying on repeatedly. The difference was that when Katie was helping me, my mom and best friend, she was very caring about it. She didn’t make me feel that she was trying to up sale me and didn’t treat me like I was money to her either. She felt like family to me, she made me feel like she was just another aunt helping me find the dress that made me feel special. To have that special relationship from the owner of a big wedding business as a new bride was an honoring experience. I tried on the dress & again I loved it. Also comparing the prices for the same dress at the other boutiques, my dress at blossoms was for a more fair price than other places. Throughout my experience with blossoms, their staff was very hands on with all of my needs. Their wedding dress tailor Yasmin was so determined to stay as my tailor from beginning to end. I had postponed my wedding date due to Covid and they were very understanding about it. If I ever know anyone of my family or friends getting married, I will always recommend Blossoms bridal.

I'm so lucky I found Blossoms! They have an amazingly wide selection of dresses at their store! I'm picky and I had a specific style I was looking for in mind, so even though they ...

didn't have exactly what I was looking for, the store manager was able to order one for me that is exactly what I want. The best part is, they have in-store tailoring, so you don't have to go to 2 separate places to buy and tailor your dress. It also means they know what they're talking about when it comes to tailoring and cost estimates. I just feel like their customer service was so great, I ordered my dress here and am super happy. I can't wait to get it in a few months and will update!

Blossoms was my first bridal shop visit and I must say, it set a VERY high bar for how one should be treated while dress shopping. My consultant, Kristine, was friendly and welco...

ming and made my family and I feel like royalty! To brides heading to Blossom's, I suggest first getting an idea of what dresses/styles you'd like so that the consultant can better pinpoint the right dresses for you. (The dresses are all encased in plastic and there are A LOT of them and they're all close together so it doesn't lend itself to you checking dresses out yourself.) Kristine was great at listening to what I was looking for and grabbing dresses that I loved. When I had decided on my favorite, she set us up with a mirror in the front of the store so I could see the dress in natural light, and helped display every part of the dress in all of its beauty so that my sister could take the best pictures. It was so lovely to feel like they were going the extra mile! Ultimately, I put off the decision on the dress because it was my first-ever appointment and I wanted more time to decide, but I would wholeheartedly recommend Blossom's to any bride. They have such a wide selection and Kristine was an amazing consultant to work with. Thank you, Kristine!

This was the third dress shop I visited and by far my worst experience. The consultant was late to the appointment, and, once I finally started trying on dresses, she wasn't having...

me try on any of the dresses I picked out. When I mentioned I didn't like a detail on a dress she had pulled, she would argue with me about it. She would leave for long stretches of time which led to me zipping up my own dress on one occasion and having my friend unzip me on another. She also wasn't always in the room when I would discuss the dress which explains why everything she pulled was the exact opposite of what I wanted. When she was there, she would insist on my friends taking pictures and even changed the settings on my friend's phone without her permission. When trying on one dress, I mentioned that I loved the horsehair detailing on it. She told me "that's not horsehair." Then when she took it out of the bag she said "oh it is horsehair." I did find a dress I loved there, after my friend insisted the consultant let me try on one we had picked out, and I asked the consultant to write down the information for me. Since I'd had such a poor experience at Blossoms, I hoped to find this same dress elsewhere and found out that it had been discontinued. The consultant at Blossoms did not tell me this and made it seem like I'd be able to order it. Thankfully, another shop was still able to get it made for me and I will be buying through them instead.

My experience with Blossoms was very pleasant. A long time ago, I bought my senior prom dress from them, so my mom suggested returning for my wedding dress. We were assisted by Chr...

istine (for disclosure's sake, she is a family friend so there was a connection there before our experience this time). From the moment we walked in, we felt like every employee cared about how I looked and felt. Christine listened to me explain all that I wanted from my dress, from specific details (sleeves, deep neckline, lace) to abstract thoughts (a woodland princess that fell into a bed of white flowers and rolled around until her dress transformed into a magical gown). She instantly knew exactly what I wanted, and brought out THE dress that I ended up saying yes to at a later date (with more witnesses for the big moment). When we asked if she had recommendations for jewelry, veil, shoes, and other details, she brought out specific products, without feeling like she was going for an "upsell". It was a genuine suggestion, and we ended up going with her recommendations, with zero regrets. The one hiccup we had during the alteration process, which had nothing to do with the sales staff or management, and entirely to do with the seamstress and her poor scheduling skills. We had an appointment for our final fitting (it had already been altered, and it was time for the pickup appointment) and a week before the appointment, we were informed that the seamstress was going to be on vacation. We couldn't reschedule, because I was traveling from out of town and couldn't arrive earlier or leave later, so we ended up just picking up the dress without having the seamstress look at it one last time. That being said...it needed zero extra alterations so she probably didn't need to be there anyway! But the added stress of that call was very frustrating. Overall, I recommend that EVERY bride in the Bay Area try Blossoms. It was one of the best experiences of our whole process.

DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY AT BLOSSOMS BRIDAL! I was talked into buying a stock wedding dress that was 6 sizes too big and Blossoms assured me they could alter it to make it p...

erfect. I called to set my first fitting at 12 weeks out (as I was concerned with the amount of alterations that were needed) and the staff member gave me attitude that I was calling to schedule the fitting that early. After I pushed, they reluctantly scheduled my fitting. The seamstress was abrupt and frustrated with the amount of work she needed to do. Then they called 2 days before my second fitting to say it wasn't ready. When I finally had the 2nd fitting, it was AWFUL! The dress gapped from my body, the zipper pouched away from my back and you could feel the bulkiness of the dress as they just overlapped all the material trying to size it down. 2 1/2 weeks from my wedding day and I didn't have a dress I could wear! Not to mention the alterations cost more than the dress! They were unwilling to resolve the issue and wouldn't refund the dress cost. I had to go find a new dress that wouldn't need alterations 2 1/2 weeks before I left for my wedding...awful customer service and excessively expensive! Would NOT recommend them to anyone!

I worked with Blossoms for both my wedding dress as well as our tux rentals. This is a hard review to write because we had two very different experiences. If I based this review ...

off just getting my wedding dress I'd give them a full 5 stars. They were great to work with, my dress was so beautiful and came at a very great price! On the flip side if I had to give them a review based just off the tux rentals I'd only give them 2 stars. They weren't very organized at keeping all their records of measurements, some were on paper some in their computer. I had to call a few times to clear things up with my file, only to have them not fix it on their computer and have to deal with it all over again. Also I ended up having to go buy a suit for my 3 year old ring bearer because every time I tried to bring him into the shop to get measurements done I was told there was no one working at that time who knew how to take measurements.

I bought my dress at Blossoms for a September 2013 wedding and they were very easy to work with. They stayed within my price range and gave me a huge discount on the La Sposa dress...

I wanted. In addition, they also gave us a discount on the alterations. My only issue was the alterations needed to be fixed as the hemming was still too long and the dress had to be cleaned again because they had gotten it dirty. However, once alerted to the problem they did a wonderful job resolving it. I was so pleased with my dress and have already recommended them to two other friends getting married in the area.

They have a huge selection of both bridal and formal gowns here. Which was helpful because to my surprise I ended up picking a formal gown for my wedding dress. They're selection...

and prices were great! Unfortunately, I felt that many of the staff needed better training. I was misquoted on the price of the sash I wanted to buy, and after deciding I wanted to buy it it was almost double in price to what I was quoted. When I complained they were able to knock off some of the price but it was still way over the original quote, unfortunately I had already fallen in love with it and couldn't say no. I was also told that I wouldn't be charged for some of the alterations and the notes were in my computer file. The day after my second fitting I looked at my receipt and saw that I was charged. I called and she told me to call back the next day because she didn't know what to do. When I called the next day I had talked to two different people before they were able to find the notes stating I shouldn't be charged for that piece. Then she said next time I come in they would refund me because it would be easier for them if I waited. Given that I lived 3-hours away and had to make special trips there I wasn't going back very soon, and didn't want to have to wait that long for my refund. I finally got them to refund me that day over the phone. While it all worked out, I felt it was more hassle for me then it should have been. Overall the staff was very nice. However, they could've been a little better trained when it came to resolving customer service mistakes. I would still return given the prices and selection

Blossoms has a fantastic selection of wedding gowns in various price ranges. We showed up to our appointment and they were overbooked. A consultant helped us pick out a few dress...

es, got us in a room and then had to go help another customer. We didn't mind much as I don't like overattentive salespeople, so it was nice to be able to try the dresses on at our own pace. I ended up finding a dress I LOVED, but it was my first stop so we decided to go a few other places, just in case. After visiting a couple other salons, we decided the first dress was MY dress and went back to purchase. The dress ran a little short, so we ordered it with extra length (5 extra inches). A couple months later my dress came in and I excitedly went in to try it on and this is where things started to go wrong. Unfortunately the dress did NOT come with the extra length and barely skimmed the ground with no shoes on. I asked if they could simply reorder the dress. It was then they told me they had made a mistake and the dress had been ticketed wrong initially and they had sold it to me at 60% off unknowingly (a difference between $3,500 and $1,400). Therefore, they would not reorder the dress because they would be taking too much of a loss. I decided to just keep the dress, because I LOVED it and apparently it would be out of my budget if I went elsewhere to buy it. However, I asked for the $500 back that I had paid for extra length. The cashier was uncertain how to do this (not her fault, we understood), so we made an appointment to meet with the store manager the next day to discuss the matter further. When we showed up, we were told the manager was at a fashion show and forgot about our appointment and would not be in for 2 hours at least. We were not able to come back (we HAD made an appointment after all...), so the manager called us to settle the issue. In the end, we were credited our $500 and I did get my dress, but the hassle and stress we went through was unnecessary. I took my dress home immediately and went elsewhere for alterations as I did not trust their organization or management system if they could make simple mistakes like selling a dress for $2000 cheaper than intended, ordering the wrong thing and creating such a hassle for the customer to right THEIR wrongs. I would not recommend Blossoms Bridal on their service alone.

.0) Value: (3.5/5.0) Flexibility: (2.5/5.0) Edit Review I have very mixed feelings about this location. They have moved since I bought my wedding dress so I think they have a lot more space now. My first appointment was a little different I went in to try on a specific dress; I wanted to compare that dress to a satin one. At my first appointment someone had double booked the sales lady, but I thought she did a very good job juggling everyone. At that point I wasn’t upset about the double booking because I understand situations happen. By the fourth double booked appointment I was not very happy with they way they handle appointments. Also, they told me my dress would take no longer then 20 weeks and it took almost 23 weeks and no one even called me to confirm it had arrived. I went to my first fitting appointment, which I made a month and a half out, and I just hoped it was there. When I called to make my first fitting appointment the sales lady on the phone confirmed information about my dress and the size that she told me was the wrong size. So, I told her that and she said she would have a manager call me back. It took a week before I spoke to a manager and I had called three times I that week. When I talked to the manager she said she thought someone had called me but that what she thought happened was it was inputted into the computer wrong. I told her I wanted more assurance that it was ordered in the right size so I had to sit on the phone while she called the designer place and get it confirmed, which should have been done the first day I called. That was the start to some "bad" appointments and calls. At the first appointment the main lady left me with a trainee because she had to go cover the prom store. This was a little frustrating because I was spending a lot of money and wanted to make sure the measurements were right. I left the dress there to get the straps put on and later that week I decided I was going to pay to have it taken in. I called to make an appointment and when I got to my appointment early they had triple booked and I waited 45 minutes (after a a45 minute drive) to find out it wasn't at the store and I had to come back another day. In no way did they try to compensate for their mistakes and my inconvenience. The seamstress did a very good job on the straps and taken in my dress (they had to re cut my corset because of the lace). When I went to the last appointment I had to ask about my veil because after four weeks they never called to say it arrived. Then, they told me the computer said it was there but they hadn’t unpacked their boxes yet and said I should come back. Since I drove 45 minutes I explained it was too far so I had to wait for them to search for m veil. All in all, the price isn't too bad; the base price of my lace Casablanca was 735 then 50 for straps and 50 for a corset back. I paid 15 to have the straps sewn on and 80 to have the corset cut (an inch on each side). However, there is definitely a lack of communication and note taking on the part of the store. Many of the sales ladies are very friendly in person and try to be helpful but that doesn’t make up for the amount of stress that comes with all the confusion. They may be better now with a new location that isn’t in a mall.

y wedding shoes and placed my order. Two days later I got a call asking if I was ready to place my order. I went in and the owner reassured me that everything was fixed. Then I get a call 3 days later saying that they went ahead and placed my order. My dress was custom hollow to hem length and when I recieved my dress it was too short to wear the shoes i was measured in. I asked what happened and they told me they input the default length instead of my custom length that I PAID FOR! A new dress could not be ordered in time and the length could not be altered. They offered free alterations to compensate for the issue. When I went in for my first fitting the tailor didn't show up and I had to go back that evening. Even though I was there first they took a group of 4 bridesmaids before me and made me wait!Of course they didn't enjoy me voicing my concerns. The tailor measured me for the alterations for the top but after two visits to fix it he told me I just needed to get a more padded bra to fix the issue. He also used eye hooks for my bustle which was ripping the lace. I told the manager about the problems I was having and she made an appointment to meet with me to personally measure me for my last fittings. She didn't even show up. I went into the store when I knew the manager would be their and she asked me to wait while she rung up other customers so they wouldn't hear me talking about my issues. I wait 20 minutes and asked her to speak with me know or give me every penny back. She asked me what I needed and said she thought that I was done with everything. She asked me to tell her everything that happened from the beginning and to step outside to talk. She started to help more people and I said that if she didn't want to give me the time then I would talk in front of her customers. She accused me of being a stressed out and emotional bride in front of everyone, which I was because of all the trouble with my dress!! Another customer got upset about an issue she was having and someones mom got mad at the manager for talking to me the way she had. People started to walk out and she got upset that I was "scaring off her business". Please just don't do this to yourself like I did. Check the reviews here, check yelp and yahoo and trust what people have said. My friends sister ordered a prom dress and paid in full. They never placed the order and she had a hard time getting her money back then she had to take a floor sample since there wasn't enough time for a new one! Just because they've switched locations doesn't mean they are any better managed!!!
