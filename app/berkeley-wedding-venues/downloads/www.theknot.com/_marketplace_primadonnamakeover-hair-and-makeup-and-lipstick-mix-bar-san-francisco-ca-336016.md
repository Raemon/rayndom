We originally booked with Yolanda and although she mentioned Brooke a couple times it was always implied that Yolanda would be at our event. It turns out, she was out of town for t...

he event and Brooke offered to be at our event for her. Brooke was so nice but we didn’t really know much about her style. I wish her involvement would have been more explained in the beginning so we could have done more research. We absolutely hated the makeup she did for the first two bridesmaids. She was given a picture for color inspiration for eyeshadow and took that as permission to lay everything on super thick. We got into drag queen territory and it took two other makeup artists, the bride’s makeup artist and a guest who happened to be an artist, to tone it down to acceptable. It seemed she just wanted to copy the picture rather than actually work with the face and skin tone of her client. She also got blue eyeshadow all over the first girl’s face and instead of cleaning and starting over, she just added more and more light powder to already very fair skinned girl. She looked like a ghost. For the last girl, it took a lot of supervision to get a result close to what we desired. Unfortunately we were doing everything for the set up ourselves and booked a makeup artist so we wouldn’t have to worry about getting ready. We didn’t have time to start over and supervise. I kind of expected someone to know how to match their client’s actual face with an inspiration. We had absolutely no problem with the separately booked artist who did the bride so I don’t think that’s unreasonable. She was super sweet though and we did eventually get a look we were ok with. I don’t think I’d ever use them again though.

n 2010 and 2018. Yolanda is our go-to hair and makeup stylist in my group of friends because she is so talented and personable. She is extremely organized and thorough; she arrives early and stays through the whole event to do touch-ups and hairstyles changes if desired. Yolanda is always very prepared; she can set up a trial run for hair and makeup to prepare for the event and has recommendations to make the wedding day go smoother. Yolanda does a great job listening to the hairstyle you desire and the amount of makeup that you feel comfortable with. Furthermore, I have rosacea so it was very important to me that I felt confident about my skin during these occasions, and she was so comforting and encouraging! I highly recommend Yolanda to everyone, she will make you look like a Disney princess on your special day!

I could not be happier with my experience with Yolanda and Primadonna Makeover. Her competitive rates and her years of experience are what convinced me to hire her, but, as I live ...

out of town, I was a little nervous since I wouldn't be able to do a trial run before the wedding as so many people suggested I do. Yolanda put me at ease by going out of her way to check in with me during the weeks leading up to the wedding and gave me some really helpful tips to start using to look and feel my best on the big day. The proof was in the pudding, however, and her work was above and beyond what I could have imagined. First off, spending most of the wedding day with the bridal party, it's important to have someone who is pleasant and a welcome presence, which she certainly was. She fit right in and felt like one of the gang. And every one of the bridesmaids and moms - each with very unique looks and hair colors, from silver to mermaid green - looked AMAZING! I was beyond thrilled with what she did with my hair and make up. My make up looked awesome and I felt gorgeous, but my hair took the cake. I came to Yolanda with a headpiece my grandmother had worn at her wedding and not much more direction or vision than that I wanted to incorporate it into some sort of an up do. The hairdo she came up with and accomplished was STUNNING. It seriously took my whole look to another level and was such an unexpected gift. She was easily one of my favorite vendors to work with and certainly one of my best hires. I couldn't recommend Primadonna Makeover more!

Yolanda and Brooke traveled to Pacifica to do hair and makeup for me and my wedding party. They were both incredible! They became a part of our family for the day. They were funny,...

smart, and professional. Yolanda did an exquisite job on makeup for me and six other girls. (There were originally only four girls scheduled, but Yolanda and Brooke were very helpful in including my aunt and sister-in-law as well. ) Yolanda provided us with great tips and makeup techniques as she worked on us individually. Brooke was a true talent. She gave my maid of honor, sisters, and mother gorgeous hairstyles. I highly recommend Yolanda and her team. Not only are they amazing at what they do, but they are incredibly fun to work with as well.

I was the mother of the groom. I found that Yolanda and her assistant did a beautiful job with the bride and her attendants. Yolanda is very professional. We had a large wedding pa...

rty and she started very early with the girls so she could spend time with each one. They all looked beautiful! The only advice I would give mothers of the groom is to request that your hair and makeup be done early so that you can go back to spend time savoring the day before the wedding with your son. While I thoroughly enjoyed spending time with the girls, in the end, my makeup was very rushed and I had little time to dress for the wedding.

Yolanda and her assistant were wonderful. My best friend got married last weekend and they were extremely professional and timely. They were able to make the bride, 7 bridesmaids, ...

mothers and grandmothers of the bride and groom look amazing. They were good about appropriate colors for each of us (I'm pale and other makeup artists have made me look like a raccoon). They were extremely prepared and even brought straws for post-makeup hydration. She provided full circle service, arriving at 6am working tirelessly until we left for the ceremony around 2:30 and providing touchups before pictures after the ceremony. We enjoyed both Yolanda and her assistant and they did a great job on all of our hair and makeup. Thanks Yolanda!
