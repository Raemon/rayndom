, Gina was very responsive, knowledgeable and accommodating to all questions, comments or concerns we had. She even addressed my parents' questions before they had a chance to ask them! Throughout the entire process Gina had such a fun, confident energy to help guide us. We did not have a wedding planner but did use Gina as a day of coordinator, and couldn't have been more pleased. She was there setting up tables, helping to serve drinks, food, and also coordinating our vendors. During the evening, she aided in adjusting timing for our special day to go smoothly. On top of that, all the food Chef Robert made was delicious. Our guests noted this whole team's professionalism and friendliness, all leaving with full and happy bellies! My family and I would highly recommend Elegant Occasions to anyone looking for a caterer and can't say enough good things about them. They are truly the best!

churri topping leading up to my wedding. Gina and her team made sure that everyone was having a great time and had everything they needed. Gina also was amazing at keeping the day running smoothly and communicated with all our vendors. Gina and her team provide 5 star service and 5 star delicious meals.

cream portions were such a fun touch and a hit with everyone! A huge shout out to Chef Robert here. The food presentation was beautiful, and so many of our guests went back for seconds and made it a point to tell us how great it was. Gina and her team were so professional and made everything feel easy from start to finish. It was so thoughtful of them to find us during cocktail hour to make sure we got to enjoy all the passed appetizers. On top of that, Gina really went above and beyond by helping with our rentals for games, lighting, and linens. She felt like more than just a caterer—almost like an extra wedding planner! I can't recommend Gina and her lovely team enough for anyone looking for amazing food and service.

Elegant Occasions Catering was an absolute gem to work with for our wedding! From the initial tasting to the wedding day execution, Gina, Robert, and their team exceeded our expect...

ations every step of the way! At our tasting meeting, Gina helped us decide on the color of linens, type of silverware and plates, and the overall “flow” of how the dinner service would go down. The food they served at the tasting was absolutely delicious, and we decided to go with the “Festive Occasion” buffet menu, which included plenty of options for food, as well as full bar service. The tri tip and bistro chicken were wonderfully seasoned, the Hasselback Potatoes were some of our favorite potatoes we’ve ever eaten, and weeks later I'm still wanting more of the Fennel sausage & cheddar stuffed mushroom caps as well as the Parmesan crusted onion canapes that were served as appetizers. Luckily they did pack us a “to go” box with plenty of leftovers that we quickly consumed over the next few days. Their complete and transparent pricing package makes it extremely easy to tell exactly what you will be getting, especially compared to other vendors with obfuscated fees, tips, etc. We would highly recommend doing business with Gina and Robert at Elegant Occasions.

Elegant Occasions is the best in the business if you're getting married in the Bay Area or throwing any large event! Gina was amazing at helping us plan and really helped make the ...

process as seamless as possible for a large wedding party. She really was able to make the day go smooth and beyond what we could have expected. The food was exquisite, the set up was perfect, and the rest of the staff was super friendly. Big props to Chef Robert as well! I would recommend to anyone looking for a caterer that checks all the boxes! We couldn't have made a better choice! Dream come true working with Elegant Occasions!

We could not recommend Elegant Occasions Catering enough! They were recommended to us through our original wedding venue and were delightful and helpful from the beginning. Everyth...

ing was explained in detail, and we were able to sign a contract right away. They provide multiple dinner options which we picked one and we did a tasting about 6 months before our wedding. The food was amazing, and they were accommodating in changes we had and making gluten free options. They also provided linens, silverware, plates, bar service, waiters and waitresses, etc. We unfortunately had to change our venue last minute and Elegant Occasions was very accommodating and understanding. We did have to pay extra since our new venue was fully outdoors, but it was worth it. Gina was amazing and went above and beyond on our day. Our day of coordinator was a bust and did not do her job, but Gina took over and acted as a coordinator for us on top of catering. She helped with making sure our DJ knew when to announce things like our first dance, making sure we got food, and even setting out our cake and cupcakes for dessert. As far as food goes, the appetizers for the cocktail hour were delicious and everyone was raving about them. We chose the brie and fig crostini, parmesan onion crusted canape, caramelized onion artichoke and parmesan mushroom cap, and mini grilled cheese. For dinner we went with the Festive Occasion dinner and chose the roasted brandy peppercorn tri tip with chimichurri, pan Seared Mushroom Chicken Thighs, Napa cheese tortolini, frisee salad, and fresh bread and vegetables. All of the food was great and everyone keeps talking to us about how much they enjoyed it. We also opted to provide our own drinks for the wedding to save some money, but it was easy to drop everything off with them the week before the wedding and they set everything up! They had multiple people working with them and had someone working the bar and everyone was so nice and great. Overall, we couldn’t recommend Elegant Occasions enough!

to visit the venue before the wedding weekend, but Gina was very knowledgeable and helped me pick what was best for my space.

/21 wedding- even before we confirmed a venue! I had recalled seeing their penguin truck out & about many times on my commute. From our very first consultation, Gina had been nothing short of amazing. We were blown away with our tasting- not only because they allowed us to truly experience our menu, but the genuine kindness of Robert & Gina. They're extremely attentive & after the wedding, i can say the WHOLE TEAM is! The set up they did for our fall wedding was beautiful & everything that I envisioned. They added lovely touches throughout the venue- ones that only an eye with experience could come up with. The food was SPECTACULAR! I could've lived off our appetizers & s'mores cupcakes, in particular! I cannot recommend this company enough. Such a lovely group of folks.

Where do we even begin?? We were blown away by Elegant Occasions. Gina and her team catered our wedding at a church in Oakland in September 2021. All of our pre-event meetings went...

well, and we especially enjoyed being able to do a full tasting of each of the appetizers and meals. Gina patiently answered all of our questions and addressed our concerns one by one. She took so much stress off of our plates in the months leading up to the wedding and during the day itself and you can’t put a price on that. On the day of the wedding, the food was delicious, and the presentation was supreme in every way! Gina was very attentive to our needs throughout the day, and made sure everything ran smoothly. The staff members were extremely courteous and helpful! They even brought cocktails and appetizers to us during family pictures after the ceremony. We only heard raving reviews from our guests. Gina and her team went above and beyond! They lit candles, cleared centerpieces off the tables, placed favors at each place setting, and even left a sweet note in our guestbook! Gina was accommodative of special requests, including picking up linens early and several complex dietary restrictions. We also really enjoyed the fact that this was a small, local, family-owned business in the Bay Area. We highly recommend Elegant Occasions for any special event!!

e of years ago, and on my niece's wedding just 10 days ago, where I served as wedding coordinator. Elegant Occasions is not just a great catering company, they are wedding professionals who know how to run a great event. Of course, the food is delicious, beautifully presented, and served by a top notch staff...but they also make sure every detail of the day is thought through and taken care of. And when some unexpected issue arises during the day, as it always does with a wedding, Gina's calm, confident, can-do attitude is so reassuring. With Gina, Chef Robert and their staff on your team, you can relax, enjoy the day, and know that your guests will enjoy it too!

Beyond excellent. They have tables, decor, chairs etc. now let’s talk food and drink. Nobody beats the value with the inclusive bar. Nobody. I researched a LOT and I know the ...

hospitality industry. Greeting guests as they arrived with the fruit water station is a must. The prime rib was so tender and I don’t understand how Chef Rob got it to taste so perfect it’s better than House of Prime Rib SF lol. The guests were totally amazed and have not stopped telling me in detail about their favorite things they ate (everything). Passed appetizers were amazing. Gina does it all - she just knows everything you will want or need. I promise you this. This lady is the best. She’s planner/manager/hostess combined. We added to the buffet and I’m glad we did. We had prime rib, glazed salmon and Tuscan chicken. Added pasta as well. The mascarpone mash (a guest said they don’t normally like potatoes but they had seconds) is delicious. Also added fruit to the vegetable/salad bar and I’m glad we did. If you want excellent food, service, event planning, call Gina and Chef Rob. They will make your event such a success that people will not stop talking about it. Thank you thank you to everyone at Elegant Occasions for making our wedding everything we wanted!

n entree, donut wall, and even bar drinks were all perfect when it comes to taste. In addition, the service was so great. Their team knows what they were doing and no wonder they are one of the suggested vendors from our venue. They are so organized and very attentive. One guest also mentioned that they are very clean since they don't let all the dirty plates sit on the tables. I also want to mention how touched we were with all the things Gina did for our wedding. Our event coordinator backed out last minute and guess who saved the day???Gina did!!!!!!!!! She took over and made sure that everything is going to be alright. She was very meticulous with all the details and because of that, everything was flawless. During the reception, we felt how much she cared for us by constantly checking if we were okay or if we needed anything. She made sure everything was going according to plan. We will choose Elegant Occasions over and over again. We highly recommend them and we assure you that you will never ever regret choosing them.

d vendor list and we picked them because of their wonderful reviews from past clients. We couldn't have asked for more from the team. We had 2 meetings prior to the wedding day in order to coordinate and discuss things like menu, appetizers, linens, schedule, etc. Gina has so much experience with catering weddings, and has lots of great advice and tips regarding other wedding things too. We had the tri tip carving station as well as the shrimp tower for appetizers and our guests raved about how great the food was. Gina also regularly checks in with you in order to ensure that the bride and groom get well fed and are hydrated throughout all the wedding day craziness too. The flower displays that the team sets up to complement the food displays were beautiful as well. I can't say enough about the quality of food and service from Elegant Occasions. I'm so glad I went with them for our wedding. I highly recommend Elegant Occasions for your wedding or event and believe that they're worth every penny!

iliar with the Gardens set up. We choose the cheese canope, lamb with mint sauce, sausage mushroom, fig and cheese crostini for appetizers. We got the candied pecan, goat cheese, date with maple vinaigrette salad, delicious prime rib, lemon caper salmon, potato gratin and seasonal veggies. My one regret is that I didn't eat more of my prime rib. I wasn't hungry from all the excitement but that prime was absolutely delicious. It is incredible that they can make such outstanding food in large quantities. Our guests loved it all and we have some picky eaters. Gina always checks in on you to make sure you're doing okay and keeps the night running smoothly - she really doubles as a reception coordinator so you're actually getting two services in one. It was helpful to drop off our beverages and other items with her at the final meeting. We loved the flexibility of bringing our own alcohol because we wanted to serve old fashioneds and Moscow mules. I highly recommend Gina and her team!

be. And the food is outstanding! My guest said you rarely notice food at wedding, but Elegant Occasions served the most delicious wedding buffet they’d ever had. From stellar communication, to tastings, to making sure we had whatever we wanted the day of, Elegant Occasions is hands down the most positive experience I have ever had with a caterer in my life. This is a family-owned third generation business with some of the kindest, most talented culinary crew out there. They take all the stress out of planning and make sure you big day is beyond delicious.

Gina and her brother, Chef Robert, were fantastic! My husband and I were married on Treasure Island, San Francisco in Sept 2018, at a venue that didn't have a standard kitchen. The...

pop-up kitchen that Gina and her brother set up was barely noticeable and they managed to feed appetizers, dinner, and a late night snack to 185 guests. The banquet table was beautiful and the food was warm, delicious, and looked nice. We received several compliments from guests on how great it was. I LOVED the late night grilled cheese sandwiches! Gina was both professional and calm. I appreciated her wisdom from doing weddings for so many years (inheriting the business from her parents and grandparents). She offered great advice on the overall floor plan. Her team looked great and were quick to find us to make sure we were taken care of. Leading up to the event she was also great at responding to emails/calls and accommodating to some last minute changes. The cost was affordable and there is no doubt that I would hire Elegant Occasions again. Thank you for making the day go smoothly!

accommodating with letting us tweak the menu to our preference and supplying our own beer and wine. On the day of the wedding, they took care of everything! There was no stress on me or my family, they took care of it all! Not to mention, constantly checking in with me throughout the evening to make sure everything was going okay. Based off all the great reviews, I had confidence the food would be tasty, and I was not disappointed!! I was very impressed with how delicious everything was. Catering ends up being one of the biggest costs of a wedding, and Elegant Occasions is very competitively priced compared to others I priced. Honestly- worth every penny!! You will not regret hiring Gina at Elegant Occasions for your event!

During the actual wedding, the food was amazing and she made sure that my husband and I ate first (and when that didnt work because our guests kept coming up to us, she hid some plates in the back for us for later!), and helped make sure that we visited all of our guests and kept us on track via our timeline! I cannot thank her enough for all of her help and what she did for our wedding. Gina is amazing!

n advance and have gotten many compliments from our guests on how delicious and high quality their spread was. It was an Italian theme dinner with some highlights of the tiramisu cake and shrimp bar tree which was a hit amongst our guests too! We were very impressed on how organized, prompt, and overall charismatic Gina was when we collaborated about our ideas, timelines, and special requests during this stressful wedding planning business. She had great feedback on how much alcohol to buy, adjusting our seating arrangements, understanding the timing when to allow our guests to get their meals, and coordinating the entire process with such a positive attitude. She made sure the entire wedding party had their meals during the chaos of entertaining and mingling which shows how well she can facilitate large parties and events. Gina is a pro at coordinating and made sure I was able to fit in all my dress changes (5 times to be exact) during the Wedding Reception. Also, I acknowledge her staff who kindly carved our baked pig and would have been a challenge for our guests to enjoy. Gina comes from a family of multiple generations who were event planners and just loves planning grand events! I highly recommend Elegant Occasions and please do not hesitate. Lastly, Gina is such a pleasant, energetic, and highly experienced professional. You will not regret having her and the catering team for your future events. <3

I cannot believe that I missed an opportunity to review this wonderful caterer on The Knot! Even though this review is 3.5 years late( yes, 3.5 years!!) I’m still going to write it...

because they deserve a standing ovation and a million thanks from our family. My daughter was married in May of 2014 and I found Elegant Occasions on a certain website that rates customers opinions. Tons of 5 Stars!! I feel very fortunate that Gina and her amazing crew were a part of my daughter’s special day. Gina was the consummate professional with a heart of gold. The buffets that she offers are DELICIOUS! Our guests raved about the food selections and the flavors that her wonder chefs put forth. She has years of experience, and wedding knowledge that just seems to calm the most nervous of brides, (which my daughter was one of) just when I thought I was losing control, she took over the reins and helped me to relax enough to enjoy our daughters wedding day. I was my daughters wedding planner, and oh my goodness, what a relief when Gina stepped in to make it all so wonderful. Thank goodness Gina was available to cater our daughters wedding. She made it perfect! Her prices were absolutely reasonable and she has the ability to do it all...rentals, cake, no hidden charges, even ice sculptures! Gina will always have my respect and admiration, and our thanks. If you get lucky enough to hire Gina, you too will know what we know...she and her Elegant Occasions Catering team are AWESOME!! Don’t walk...RUN!...to hire this great caterer. There, I feel much better knowing that Gina finally got the stellar review that she deserved 3.5 years ago. Thanks again, Gina. You were a delight. :)

HIRE ELEGANT EVENTS. right now. Gina and the whole team were beyond anything I could every write in a review. From DAY 1 Gina made me more relaxed. She has so much experience, she ...

know so much. She literally has all of the answers and not just about the menu...but about the entire wedding planning process. She is calm cool and collected. She made ME calm cool and collected. She was also extremely great at communication. ALWAYS answered or got back to me very very quickly and for a bride to be that is important. Their pricing for an open bar is not beatable. Trust me I looked. I even priced out what it would be to bring in our own alcohol and just hire the bartenders and they were still significantly less expensive and without the headache. The FOOD. So many people have complimented on the food. The appetizers never ran out (which always seems to be an issue). Guests didn't have to chase down the servers to get appetizers (also always seems to be an issue). The dinner portion was very substantial and delicious. We had vegans at our wedding and they raved about their food as well. My husband and I had what felt like our own personal server who was constantly checking in on us. Brought me more food. Gina also constantly checked in on us, brought us food and drinks wherever we were throughout the night. I mean come on! We also did the late night snack...the grilled cheese sandwiches. It's 100% worth the price (which is reasonable) and I personally had like 7. Also, Gina handled some of our drunk guests like a pro...cut them off and discretely told us - no stress - she just handled it. Hire Elegant Event Occasions. You will not regret it. I did not have a single issue with their company throughout the entire process (2 years - we booked early). If I did it all over again, I would hire them without hesitation. THANK YOU GINA!!!!!

Gina and her team were absolutely amazing! We got married on September 23rd and we had the most beautiful wedding all thanks to Elegant Occasions. The food was amazing we had about...

220 guests we had tri trip, chicken, a beautiful vegetable display, fruit and her delicious blue cheese candied walnut salad which was the best salad I ever had and I don't even like blue cheese. We went with the 6 hour open bar which was a big hit. We also had grilled cheese sandwiches as our late night snack! Gina's attention to detail is unbelievable; she locks in and delivers every last request. We brought her our decorations and she did an outstanding job and did exactly what I dreamed of without me even telling her. Her staff is super friendly and very attentive. By the time our wedding day came I felt like I was best friends with Gina because she has a super friendly and fun personality. The pricing for what you receive is very reasonable and worth every penny! Gina thank you so much! Book far enough in advance because she is extremely popular and I know why! :)

I can't imagine an easier catering company to work with for a wedding, and their price was really, really impressive. Gina talks fast and whips her way through questions and decisi...

ons and all of a sudden, your wedding is half planned. She and Chef Robert are so friendly and even though they must do a hundred weddings a weekend (ok maybe not) they seem to genuinely care that your day is special and stress-free. It was a huge weight off our shoulders that Gina also works as a day-of coordinator, setting up decorations, communicating with other vendors, and troubleshooting any issues that arise. And I couldn't believe how big their staff is! When we arrived to set up at the venue, it seemed like a whole army was bustling around setting up all the tables and prepping food. And they all had the same friendliness and work ethic. When we were taking post-ceremony photos during the cocktail hour, someone swung by to ask us our drink orders and brought us a plate of appetizers. When we forgot to grab champagne glasses for the toast, someone ran off to make sure they were at our table when we sat down. There were so many details to keep track of, but knowing that Gina was keeping track of them too made things less stressful. So grateful for all of their help!

There aren't enough good things I can say about Elegant Occasions & Gina. Working with them was one of the easiest decision we made - not only do they provide the food, but they al...

so provide linens, tableware, servers, and bartenders and alcohol (but you can provide your own booze and get a discounted rate), all included in the total. When I was comparing other caterers, choosing Elegant Occasions was a no-brainer. We also asked them to make the cakes, and the carrot cake in particular was a HUGE hit! Everything went very smoothly - we provided our own alcohol, but Elegant Occasions made sure it got to the venue. I planned most of the wedding myself, and thanks to Gina's knowledge of our venue, she helped guide me through a great deal of the planning process. The day wouldn't have gone nearly as well without her input. On the day of the wedding, her staff was professional and attentive and Gina herself was onsite to oversee it all. They made sure we had food to eat and a drink in our hand at all times, which I know is a rare thing for the bride and groom on their wedding day. And the food was simply amazing - it's not often that guests rave about wedding buffet food, but all we've been hearing are compliments (in addition to the carrot cake, I can also personally recommend the wasabi horseradish and the onion cheese canape!). We would hire Elegant Occasions for all future event needs in a heartbeat!

ed because I felt so confident since they had been in business for generations and it was a family operation. And I was RIGHT, my guests are still raving about the food because it was not your typical chafing dish wedding food. We had a Tri Tip Carving station, Chicken Saltimbaca, caramelized onion mashed potatoes and amazing appetizers. The best part was they decorated the buffet tables with flowers that matched our decor. I wouldn't have even thought of that much less had time to worry about buffet tables either. It was just one of the many pleasant surprises! The value for their service is unsurpassed. The crew was so friendly and helpful throughout the night. And the pre-planning was amazing. Gina helped us through all the steps, made great suggestions, and ultimately made the reception a success. Put Elegant Occasions at the top of your list!!

linens, nicer chairs, coordinating with other vendors, etc. Gina help manage everything with such grace. She made sure we were well taken care of throughout the whole event. She always made sure to always check in with us if we wanted something to drink or eat. The chef and waiting staff did an excellent job. Very professional throughout. The food was delicious. We constantly got compliments on how delicious the food was. All our guests were super happy with the experience. They even complimented how great Gina and catering staff was. The best part was our catering came with a full bar with bartenders. We will use Elegant Occasions with any future catering. I couldn't think of using anyone else. Thank you so much for such excellent service!!!

Elegant Occasions is THE WAY to go for any Bay Area event. My partner and I selected Elegant Occasions to cater our wedding in Walnut Creek on 10/1. Gina has her business down. FO...

OD - Delicious, chose the Affair to Remember buffet plus passed hors d'oeuvres at the cocktail hour . Like the other reviews, the dinner was very good and plentiful. My family was very happy and still talk about it. LATE NIGHT GRILLED CHEESE. Elegant Occasions offers "late night snacks." Are you kidding me? This was one of the best decisions we made for the wedding. Guests are present from 4-10PM so by 9PM, the grilled cheese fueled the night on through. We had never been to a wedding that had late night snacks, but I hope it is a trend that takes off! BAR - Great bar tending service. The bar was set up outside to keep people moving and also make sure guests weren’t getting carried away. We elected to supply our own alcohol (beer & wine) and received the discount per person accordingly. However, after we bought from BevMo we realized it would have been less expensive to go with Gina’s full bar, so do the math ahead! They were even particularly helpful for guests that did not drink alcohol – supplying cider and serving the soda and NA beer we provided. Gina personally tended to the wedding party during the cocktail hour and dinner, ensuring everyone had what they needed at all times. WEDDING COORDINATOR - It was hard for us to believe on top of all the other great inclusions that Elegant Occasions has to offer that you also have a day-of coordinator (it says it in the contract, but it's hard to believe). We dropped off decorations ahead of time at the warehouse which helped a lot. Gina had the DJ, photo booth, decorator, etc all ready to go. The reality is most couples have never planned a wedding before, and Gina has planned thousands of events! Gina and Chef Rob even took over the photo booth which was a fun surprise. COST - My partner and I didn't look at many catering companies because when we found Elegant Occasions and put down a security deposit we know we were set. To some, the cost per person might appear high but the OVERALL VALUE is the best in the Bay Area. No extra fees, excellent service, professionalism. If we ever need another event catered, Elegant Occasions will be the first contact. Guests left happy and a huge part of it was the way Elegant Occasions made the night happen.

r requests. Even when we changed from a breakfast menu to a traditional dinner menu, she was happy to adjust. She was eager to help in many ways. The most helpful was that she let our alcohol distributor deliver the alcohol to her early, so that she could pre-chill everything. She was well versed in the rules of our venue and walked my family through set up and break down to ensure we would receive our full deposit back. Aside from her excellent organization, the food was delicious! We received multiple compliments from family members at our reception. Thank you so much Gina and chef Rob!!!

ant Occasions. But because you get so much for the price, I was concerned that we were compromising something. To my surprise, there was not one thing that was a disappointment. Gina went over and above helping with every detail including beautiful displays and designs for areas I had no idea what to do with. The service was amazing and the food was unbelievable. I was skeptical about how good buffet style food could be, but it was high quality and delicious. I live in Napa and I know good food, this competes with the best restaurants. Even our most discerning guests were extremely complimentary. We had four wonderful appetizers and for the entrees, Roasted Peppercorn Tri-Tip, Bistro Chicken with creamy lemon and wine caper sauce, Spinach and Cheese Ravioli with a creamy pesto . We also used the fabulous DJ and the Photobooth. They were engaged with the guests and created a fun energy at the reception. I'd like to advise you of some detail that maybe wasn't quite perfect, but they really delivered and exceeded all expectations!

ever pressured us to do anything we didn't want, and was extremely helpful when we wanted advice, and very affirming and accommodating of our choices. She is such an easy pleasure to work with, and is so prepared and experienced that she took away so much stress and worry that might otherwise have been there. Also, most importantly, the food is AMAZING. I heard many people saying it was the best food they'd ever had at a wedding, and I'm inclined to agree. We went with the menu that included pasta and it was perfect for the range of dietary needs of our guests.

Our guests raved about the food, the service and the atmosphere that Elegant Occasions created. We also went through Gina for our wedding cake, DJ and Photobooth and it was SO nice to have staff at the wedding who know each other, are good friends and have worked together in the past. I absolutely love that this is a family business and it is evident how much they care about their work and making the day memorable. I cannot recommend Gina and Chef Robert enough! They made our wedding unforgettable and so enjoyable!

It was so good people have been texting me to let me know how much they loved the food. One of the biggest things I have to say I appreciated, being the mother of bride, was that the day of the wedding I did not hear from them once with questions. They got to the venue and just did their thing. I Felt such a relief of stress because of this. Gina and there crew helped so much and took care of everything. I would highly recommend them if you want amazing food, amazing service, and beautiful display of food. Great experience! Thanks so much Gina! 😊😊
