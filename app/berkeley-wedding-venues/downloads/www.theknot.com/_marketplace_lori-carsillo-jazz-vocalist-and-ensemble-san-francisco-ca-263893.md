I knew right at the beginning of the wedding planning process that I wanted to find a jazz band—I lived in New Orleans and was very nostalgic for the music there. I reached out to ...

several and when I heard Lori’s music, I knew she was absolutely the one! I later had the opportunity to see her perform live at Cafe Claude (highly recommend this when you are picking your band) and she had a remarkable voice. She drove the theme around our wedding subsequently thereafter—the wedding had a great Art Deco / Speakeasy vibe that my guests afterwards commented fondly about. Lori has an amazing voice and presence. Her music very much set the mood of our wedding—elegant and timeless. She sang a beautiful rendition of Frank Sinatra’s Fly Me to the Moon as our first dance. During and after the wedding, our guests commented on how amazing Lori is (and considering several of them were from New Orleans and Chicago, where there were strong jazz roots, a tall order!). I highly recommend Lori and look forward to seeing her perform again. She’s phenomenal!

We found Lori through a recommendation from another artist and we are forever thankful for that recommendation. She arrived early and was able to set up and perform like a pro. She...

was polite and friendly throughout the whole event. Everyone who interacted with her only had positive things to say about her. We received many comments from our guests on how wonderful she sounded. Her wonderful voice really uplifted the air of the event. We would highly recommend her for the future couples.

Lori is absolutely wonderful. Her voice is beautiful and she is beyond professional! We loved having a classy, jazzy, live band at our wedding. Lori was very organized and communic...

ative leading up to our wedding day and performed beautifully at our wedding. I feel bad because it ended up being very cold on our wedding day (and I suspect the band wasn't very happy about this), but they all played on and kept the party going even if they weren't completely comfortable. I highly recommend Lori and her ensemble for any event.

My wife and I were having a small winery wedding in Sonoma and have always loved live jazz music. We were so lucky to find Lori on the Knot and thought she would create the perfect...

ambience for our special day! It's even hard to believe that Lori far exceeded our initial expectations!!! When we reached out Lori was so kind to provide samples of her music (and she is also on Spotify if you want to give her a listen). I feel like with most jazz groups the vocals are one of the hardest things to nail and Lori has the most beautiful voice there was no way we could go with anyone else. We went to see her live and meet her up at Cafe Claude in San Francisco and she couldn't have been friendlier! We knew then she was the person to set the mood for our wedding. In addition to jazz, Lori also does jazzy covers of other genres. For example, Lori did a hauntingly beautiful rendition of "Such great heights" by Iron and Wine for our first dance. Lori was extremely helpful in also finding us a fantastic acoustic guitarist who could play some classical music for the ceremony as well. All of the vendors we ended up choosing for our wedding were great, but both Nicole and I agreed that Lori was our favorite of all of them. We received the most compliments about her from our guests and she really set the vibe for the whole evening. We will definitely keep in contact with Lori and look forward to hearing her again in the future!!!

Lori has such a beautiful voice and it was so amazing to have her band at our wedding. Once we saw her band play at a restaurant in the city, we knew we had to have her in our big ...

day. When we contacted her, she sent us demos of her music. Lori is very professional, welcoming, responsive, and many more great things. She is so pleasant to work with and made planning a breeze! We had her guitarist play during our ceremony and the rest of her band during reception. She made our wedding so memorable. Our guests loved her and we hope to have her again when we plan another big gathering. Thank you, Lori!

Lori played our wedding 6 months ago at our very unique venue. It was perfect and amazing. I wouldn't change a thing about it! When i first messaged Lori she was so accommodating. ...

She invited me to watch her in San Francisco that very night and when I arrived she gave me 3 of her CDs to listen to. While listening at the restaurant in SF I knew we had to use her. She came and set up without issue at our venue and was ready just in time. She has a great attitude and situated herself in our very tight space in the bar and played like a real pro. She is a beautiful singer and she and her band are absolute professionals. She really added to our wedding. 100% recommendation from us!

As the bride, I was very busy the day of the wedding, so details such as the music are a bit of a blur. However, many of our guests complimented our choice of musicians, and I love...

d having live music for our first dance. Working with Lori before the event really put me at ease as she was very sweet, professional, experienced and responsive over email. Our wedding was on NYE, so that may have upped the price, but in general, it can be difficult to afford musicians when you are a budget bride like myself. Luckily, Lori was flexible with me by shortening the time they played so we could afford their service for at least part of the event. Thank you Lori for helping making our night romantic and classy!

Where to begin! Lori and her band were the ideal choice for our wedding reception. Set in the courtyard of a local San Francisco cafe, we could not have imagined a more perfect mus...

ical accompaniment to our evening. From the beginning, Lori was immensely professional, helpful and genuine. When we went to see her perform at a local SF restaurant to get a feel for her style, we were instantly decided - she was the one. To boot, we hit it off with Lori immediately. In providing a list of her music, we realized that the key songs we wanted her to play were already on there, though I will mention that she offered to include others that may not be on her list. In our opinion, no need! We loved the selection that she played all evening. Additionally, we asked Lori a favor or two to make the evening flow perfectly and she was immensely flexible and helpful. She even sent US a thank you card after our wedding. I just can't express enough how much we wholeheartedly recommend Lori. If we had the opportunity to have her play at an event again, we'd love to have her back. Thanks, Lori! Megan + Brett

We decided early on that we wanted a small destination wedding surrounded by close friends and family. For the reception we envisioned a fabulous backyard dinner party, complete wi...

th delicious food, stunning wine and some jazzy, dinner party music to cap off the night. Of course it was going to be something a bit more elaborate than what we could pull off alone, so we found some local experts to help our dreams become a reality. When it came time to track down a jazz singer, we were so fortunate to find Lori Carsillo! She perfectly understood and executed the ambiance we were aiming for. Lori was incredibly easy to work with and accommodating. Throughout the planning, to the set up and straight through to the last hour the music was perfect. The entire quartet was professional and great to work with. Lori did an amazing job at helping us select music from their extensive playlist to fit the the ceremony and entire evening. We had a few special songs, not offered in their assortment, that they were more than willing to learn, which made the music that much more meaningful! And boy did they perform all the songs beautifully!

Lori Carsillo and two band members played at our wedding reception at the Swedenborgian Church in San Francisco. The music was the perfect balance of upbeat for festivities and dan...

cing and low key for conversation and general mushiness. The best part was when Lori played Fly Me To The Moon during the first bride and groom dance, and my father cried because that was his and my mom's falling in love song. From the get-go Lori was a pleasure to work with. I found her suggested on the Swedenborgian wedding website and gave her a call. She responded right away with a professional and informative package, including sample CD and a few options with prices. She even lent her expertise to arrange a band that could play a versatile mix of jazz styles in the small, indoor space, using the church's piano for some songs, and a band-member's guitar for others. Lori is polished and approachable. As crazy and hectic as things get during wedding planning, I never had to worry about the band. The parts I was most anxious about, the first dance and the toasts, were helped along by the bands professionalism and experience. My wife and I still listen to the sample CDs, which have Cole Porter and other jazz standards. Our favorites is the opener "I Love Paris In the Morning" because Paris is where we spent our honeymoon. Yay Lori! You Jazz!

My husband and I hired Lori to provide live music for our white-tie wedding in Feb 2013 in San Jose, CA. We thought a live jazz band would be the best fit for a white-tie affair, ...

but it needed to be for less than $2,000. We looked at several jazz bands in the Bay Area; we choose Lori as she and her group are excellent performers and were the most professional, friendly, and willing to work with our budget of everyone we contacted. And our guests have had nothing but good things to say about the music/band! The planning process went smoothly; we had lots of questions initially, and Lori was very responsive via email and phone. She gave us opportunities to see her and her group live as well as mailing us a few of her CDs. Lori paid attention to the details; attire is key for white-tie, and Lori worked with us to determine what she and the group would wear for the event (a few guests even commented on how nicely the band was dressed!). My husband and I didn't have many specifics for what songs to play/not play; we instead gave Lori general ideas of the atmosphere (i.e. upbeat, low-key, etc.) we wanted for the various parts of the evening and were not disappointed with the final music selection. On the day of the wedding, Lori and her group arrived promptly and were virtually autonomous, quickly and quietly loading in their gear and setting up. We had a duo (vocals, guitar) for the "cocktail" hour and a quartet (drums, bass, same vocals and guitar) for the reception. We were doing everything in the same building but in different rooms, so some shuffling had to happen between the cocktail hour and the reception; again, the group worked quickly and quietly to move their equipment and be ready to go by the time we were ready to seat guests for dinner. The duo provided light background music you could easily carry a conversation over. The quartet kept things low-key during dinner and then picked up the pace for dancing. The volume was never too loud (or too soft, for that matter), something we--and all of our guests--absolutely loved. When the band took a break, Lori played an appropriate music selection from her iPod and they easily rolled with schedule changes to cake cutting, first dances, etc. for a (musically) seamless event. It was truly a pleasure working with Lori and her group is fabulous; would hire again!

I hired Lori for my October, 2011 wedding in San Francisco, and I was nothing short of *delighted* with the experience, and what she and her musicians created for me. I found Lori...

on Wedding Chanel and checked out her web site, and then went to see her perform at a local venue. As soon as I heard her and saw her I knew Lori was just what I was looking for: beautiful, elegant standards performed in a gracious, but not uptight manner. Lori and her musicians played in a way that did not overwhelm cocktail hour/dinner conversation and mingling, but also had enough beat and energy for dancing if people wanted to. Lori puts her own touch on the standards that makes them fresh and fun. Her voice is beautiful, elegant and fun all rolled into one. She is the real thing and it shows. In addition to being a wonderful vocalist, Lori is also a helpful consultant. She was extremely open to any and all of my questions (even things outside her precise domain related to wedding receptions). She provided me with feedback and ideas on what I could walk down the isle to, what was good first dance song in terms of tempo and length etc. Lori really made an effort to help me with anything I had questions about. I felt extremely comfortable working with her and asking her anything I wanted to. She gave me a lot of good advice and tips. We used two of Lori's CDs as wedding favors, and people were delighted to receive such a sweet memento of the evening, as well as something they could actually use and enjoy. The guests really loved her performance and all evening talked about how wonderful she was. They still talk about it. Lori and her musicians also had a very polished, and beautiful visual presentation. Lori is gorgeous in person, and dresses very stylishly. Her musicians were also perfectly appropriate. If you are looking for elegant but fun, classic music for your wedding and want to work with someone who is more than accommodating, flexible, and dependable I strongly recommend Lori. She will guide you perfectly and create a highly sophisticated, beautiful, romantic ambiance for your special day. You will be so glad you selected her!

I am SO happy that we found Lori and her band for our wedding. It was a pleasure working with Lori from beginning to end. She was not only concerned about making our day great but ...

she was 100% professional throughout the entire process. She took the necessary extra steps to ensure that not only was her band where they needed to be at the designated time but they also did so without ever disturbing guests (because Lori made sure to work out the venue's floor plan and flow of traffic prior to the wedding - genius!). Aside from being on point, Lori's voice is amazing and the whole band is extremely talented. All the guests enjoyed the music and if I ever host another event I'll be sure to get in touch with Lori.
