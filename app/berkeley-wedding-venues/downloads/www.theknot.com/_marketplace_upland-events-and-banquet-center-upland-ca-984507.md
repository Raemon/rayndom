The Upland Event Center went above and beyond for my mom’s special day. From the first meeting due to some unforeseen events from who we had originally booked the venue location ha...

d become unavailable with only a month and a half before the big day; Frank (the owner) and all his associates did everything within their power to make the transition as easy as possible and Rene (the coordinator) was amazing with all the details in making sure he truly captured the bride’s vision. Although they had such short notice the staff and vendors created the most magical day they will never forget. We are grateful to the Upland Events Center for helping create the most beautiful and memorable experience.

Frank, the owner, was AMAZING!! We met him a year before our wedding. The packages he offers are the most affordable and most practical we could find. He also works with you if you...

need more flexibility with the payment plan. He is the most flexible owner I know and very approachable, always willing to answer any questions we may have. He genuinely cares about his customers. He would always tell me he wants to make sure everything goes well for me because he doesn’t want me (the bride) to be stressed. And he really did work with me and my husband up until the wedding day. Our wedding was on September 8, 2023 and it was the BEST DAY EVER. I can honestly say that one of the reasons why we had an amazing day was because of Frank and Upland Events and Banquet Center. I don’t have the official photos from our wedding yet but will come back and add some as soon as we get them so I can also help other readers who are trying to decide. Reading reviews also helped me decide so I wanna do the same. At first, we were worried that his venue might not have enough space for our wedding (250 guests). But I’m so glad we went ahead and booked them!! Everyone still had enough space to dance on the dance floor and we were able to do the grand entrance of our HUGE WEDDING PARTY just fine! By “HUGE” I mean 14 sets of sponsors and 14 sets of bridesmaids and groomsmen🤣 Everyone definitely had a blast at our wedding! His entire team was very helpful and attentive to our needs. Also, the caterer, Martiniz Fresco Catering, that came with his package was amazing too! Their food was REALLY GOOD!! On the day of our wedding, I made sure I had a chance to eat because I enjoyed our food tasting so much. Although I only got to eat their mac and cheese and a little bit of tri-tip, I definitely enjoyed my dinner!! My husband finished his plate! 😂 We also received a lot of compliments from our guests saying they really liked the food. I was so happy to hear this because good food was one of mine and my husband’s priority. Rene, the day of coordinator, which is one of Frank’s preferred vendors, was also great. He definitely helped make our big day go smoothly. Victor, the bartender, was awesome. He was very kind and very helpful with any questions we had! The package also included our wedding cake from Somecrustbakery. The cake was really delicious!! Our cake had 4 layers and had different flavor for each layer. Our 5 year old daughter enjoyed the cake tasting and we picked the flavors that she enjoyed. Thank you for everything, Frank!! We will continue to recommend them to our friends and family and we will use them again in our future events! If you are still unsure whether you want to book this venue, feel free to message me here if you have any questions. :) You will not be disappointed! Give them a call and ask for a tour!

If I could give 6 stars, I would. I got married on 5/28/2022. The owner, Frank, is extremely reasonable. Since I paid all cash, I was able to ask for a discount on the ceremony and...

he was able to help with that. He is also ALWAYS available through text. Even when my event was very far away, he would text me back right away. The venue is all inclusive, so I didn't have to worry about the food, cake, DJ, bartender, tables, napkins, etc. I even got to choose which type of chair I wanted! The venue has recommended vendors for a wedding planner (Sharon), a photo booth, and a photographer. I did not use the preferred photographer. I was very happy with the wedding planner and photo booth. The bartender, DJ, and chef were on point! Everyone was dancing all night long and the DJ could really read the room. People got two servings of food if they wanted to. Frank and his team ensured that everything went smoothly and made me feel so stress-free during the planning and the wedding itself. I absolutely loved this place.

We had our wedding here on 5/21/22 and everything was great! We booked already and loved the fact they offered a monthly payment plan, which made it very easy to pay for our venue ...

over time. The package included all the major vendors and we received compliments on the food, the dj, and the cake! All of which were included in their very affordable package! Frank was helpful throughout the entire process, and answered the millions of questions I had. He was able to make adjustments when needed and work with us to make sure our day was perfect. The staff was friendly and very accommodating and the venue was beautiful. I would absolutely consider having another event here in the future. We can't thank Frank and has staff enough for making our day magical!

ess less and not have to worry about contacting those vendors since they came with the venue. Our guests loved the food, the cake and the music. It is certainly a plus that this place will provide the best vendors out there! Frank the owner is really nice and easy to work with. He really made me and my husband feel important. He made sure that our needs were met and he went above and beyond on the day of our wedding to step in and help when something went wrong. He was very understanding of our situation and was very accommodating to our needs. I cannot thank him enough for all he does and everyone there at the venue! This place will not disappoint you. I highly recommend it! It is beautiful, very modern and elegant and can adapt to any theme. Mine was rustic vintage and I loved how this venue has both a rustic and vintage feel to it. My wedding was more than I expected. Both me and my husband were very satisfied with the services provided by this venue. We will definitely be having future events here again!

sappointed! The venue is beautiful and modern! My guests all enjoyed themselves and were amazed at how such a beautiful venue existed in this little hidden area of upland. My husband I booked an all inclusive package and luckily booked during an open house and were able to strike an amazing deal! We were shocked at how much the venue offers its clients. We were able to get in so many of those extra details that we thought we weren’t going to be able to have because of the all inclusive package we booked. The venue offers everything you could think of, including a wedding coordinator (Sandra Buczek of Sandra Nicole Designs) who was so much fun to work with! I appreciate how much this venue worked with our budget and our requests. We had a final guest count of 184 people and the venue accommodated for all of our guests beautifully. All of their vendors deliver excellent service and the food vendors were spot on!! You will not be disappointed!! Oh I forgot to mention, we had both our ceremony and reception at the venue so for a small fee, we had the room flipped for both events. Overall we loved the venue and are so happy we chose to work with them. Thanks again for everything!!!

First and foremost I want to thank Frank the owner and Sandra the coordinator for a great experience. I booked my venue a year in advance and I've got to say I am very happy and pl...

eased with the decision I made to book here. I'm looking at other venues the cost for the venue and Catering was by far more than what we paid here. The packages are greatly price and they include just about everything that you need at a price lower than what you would pay at another venue. the coordinator was helpful throughout the entire process even though she is just a day-of coordinator. She made everything easy and beautiful I might say. They were a feel hiccups along the way. But Frank was very quick to make the adjustments needed to make my day special. The food was absolutely delicious the service was great. The bartender was friendly and knowledgeable. Jayme the photographer did absolutely great. And the security that night was friendly and did a great job at keeping everybody safe. I can seriously go on and on and on about how great this place was to us and how affordable it was as well. Feel free to comment and ask me any questions I'm more than happy to answer. I highly recommend this location for a great time.
