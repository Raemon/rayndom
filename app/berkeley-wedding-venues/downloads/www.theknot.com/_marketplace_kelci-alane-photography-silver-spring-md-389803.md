p photo sessions so much fun. Working with her for engagement photos was a great lead-in to prepare for the wedding itself, and I'm so glad we also decided to have her come photograph the rehearsal dinner too. Seriously, we will treasure these pictures forever, and she really captured us. Amazing!

king us comfortable during our photo sessions. Everything was about having fun and making memories together. In addition to being a friend and incredibly talented photographer, Kelci was invaluable in helping us plan the schedule for our day, coordinate everything that had to go right, and handle delicate family situations. We hope to get to work with Kelci again soon!

Kelci Alane Photography is EVERYTHING. I have had the pleasure of knowing Kelci for 10 years now, and she has only grown to impress me more and more over the years. Coming from the...

perspective of a type-A bride, trust me, Kelci is everything you want and need in a wedding photographer. She is cool, confident and collected during the craziness that is wedding planning and every single time to you talk to her you are left thinking, "thank god I hired her." I remember I called her stressing, and all she had to say was, "Jessica, I got you girl." She has got everything under control at all times, and she brings that vibe to your engagement shoot, on your wedding day, and every time you communicate with her. And talking about her demeanor is only the tip of the iceberg in regards to what she has to offer. Kelci KNOWS light. She gets it and utilities it to make your photos just stunning. She brings creativity and beauty to every single shot. My fiancé and I were a little anxious about our engagement photo shoot, only because neither of us are that comfortable in front of cameras. Well, with Kelci, that was a discomfort she immediately dissolved. She has a way about her, an energy, that puts you at ease. She uses really fun techniques to get you to feel comfortable and allow you to be yourself and connect with your fiancé during the shoot. It felt more like a "date" than a photoshoot :) This is how she gets the MAGICAL photos that feel authentic and moody and gorgeous. I promise, you will be beyond glad that you hired Kelci to photograph your special day. We are beyond thrilled and in love with our wedding photos and we will cherish them for years and years and years!

Having known Kelci since high school and then seeing her work, I knew that Kelci would do an amazing job for our wedding! She traveled home (to Louisville, KY) all the way from DC ...

to document our day. She made it fun (not awkward) and moved quickly so we could enjoy our day with family and friends! She also did our engagement photos that included our pup and again, made it fun and engaging. All of the photos turned out so well, I have had a hard time choosing which ones to hang in our house there are so many great ones. She truly captured our relationship and personalities through her photos. With Kelci's help, we have so many great memories that will last a lifetime!

Kelci Alane Photography is an EXCELLENT wedding photographer! A friend recommended her to us, and we tried her out for our engagement photos first. We loved her style, her vibe & t...

he aesthetic of the photos SO much, so she traveled to Maine for our wedding, too! She was the most gracious to work with. She spent TONS of time with us, went with the flow when she needed to, planned & prepped other shots, and was super accommodating (early morning shots + impromptu day-of boudoir shots + handling our families SO well). Kelci is also a blast to have around all day (which matters - it's your wedding day & you want someone fun, relaxed & easy to be around) + and she picked an equally awesome/fun second shooter (which is something I didn't even consider but is important, too). Beyond that, though, her photos are why we picked her. Her photos have a natural, real-life vibe that is so warm & unique. They seem more authentic & organic, which is what we wanted. (We kept saying we wanted our photos to capture our day, not hijack our day.) She did a few posed pictures for us; but, she excelled at candid, natural photos - and those are the ones we have in frames! Her style is definitely different from the normal wedding photographer, so make sure her aesthetic matches yours (just browse her blog for past photos). If it does, then she's GREAT to work with from pre-wedding convos to post-editing. (Tip: we hired her for a modest fee to shoot our rehearsal dinner, too. We got so many great shots of friends & family the night before - and without us in a wedding gown/tux!)

We had the pleasure of already knowing Kelci when we got engaged and after she braved a snow storm for us in order to get engagement photos in the snow, managed to make us feel so ...

comfortable that we forgot about the cold, and produced amazing pictures, it was an easy decision to also hire her as our wedding photographer. Kelci is nothing short of amazing to work with—she has an ability to make you feel at ease in front of the camera (this isn’t an easy thing to do!!) and captures authentic, real, and beautiful moments in her photographs. Several members of our family and bridal party commented on how organized and calm she was the day of the wedding and what a joy she was to be around. Kelci truly went above and beyond and we couldn’t be happier with the final product. A big thanks also to Kelci’s secondary photographer, Lauren, who was equally professional, calm, and kind! We highly recommend Kelci Alane Photography for anyone looking for a photographer who cares about her clients and captures life's naturally beautiful and authentic moments through photographs. We are so happy we chose Kelci as our wedding photographer and look forward to reliving our special day through her amazing photos for years to come.

Kelci is a rock star. I know this for three reasons: I had the pleasure of first being her co-worker, then friend, then client when she signed on to be our wedding photographer. Ke...

lci and her second photog, Lauren (who was also amazing), brought both an air of professionalism and light-hearted fun to the day. She made everyone feel comfortable in front of the camera—not an easy thing to do—and she made sure that the bride and groom had time for both the photo shoots and to enjoy the reception. After the wedding, so many guests commented on how much they enjoyed Kelci and Lauren not just as photogs but as people. And of course, we were extremely happy with how the beautiful photos turned out. I can't recommend her enough!

Hiring Kelci as our photographer was undoubtedly one of the best choices we made for our wedding. Although we are not located in DC and did not meet Kelci until the day before our ...

wedding, it felt like we had a close friend photographing our day. Her communication throughout the process was highly professional; she is clearly an expert in her field. We relied on her to add structure and cohesion to our wedding day, and she more than delivered. After the wedding, Kelci provided timely updates and sneak peeks into her product. The result was astounding - we are in love with the photographs she gave us. Kelci exceed all of our expectations. If you are considering hiring her - do it!

edding, getting to know us and our style, preparing for the day's agenda, and planning ahead for all contingencies. She's very professional while also friendly, warm, funny, relaxed, and calming. It felt like working with a good friend. On the day-of, she was great about keeping things running on time and sticking to the details that were most important to us as a couple. We got a few teaser photos within two weeks, and she sent a beautiful shot for us to use on Thank You cards. Our full portfolio of shots are stunning, and we couldn't be happier with how everything turned out!

t I wanted our photos to look like, and Kelci not only met those expectations, but raised the bar to a whole new level. She made us feel so at-ease and comfortable. The photos came out dreamy and intimate, and truly captured us and our excitement for our upcoming nuptials. Using her was one of the best decisions we made during the wedding/engagement process!

I had a few recomendations for photographers but all of them were looking for $1000 or a little less. We were looking for something more in the lines a couple hundred at best, as w...

e didn't have a large budget. So I contacted a local college, specifically Miami University in Oxford, OH. I emailed the Art department, requesting the photography professor and he requested some information that he could send out to his students. Then I got 4 emails and she is the on that I picked. She was professional and easy to work with. She did engagement photos, rehearsal and dinner photos, pre-wedding, ceremony and post-wedding photos, as well as Reception photos. It was all only $300. Now she had just graduated but she was very professional. I would assume as her experience gets better her prices may change, but I suspect that she will remain reasonable, as she really knows how to make you feel comfortable and is easy to work with, at your schedule. I highly recomend her. She is sadly moving to the Washington DC area once she finishes with her summer classes at Miami, but I would still recommend her regardless where she is.
