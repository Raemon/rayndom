Emily was hands down the best decision we could have made for our wedding. From our initial call, we felt a connection with her. Her attention to detail and high bar she sets for...

herself and her team were evident from that first conversation. Her proposal was the most thorough we received from the many planners we talked to. There were services that she offered that hadn’t even occurred to other planners! It was a worthwhile investment and we placed our complete trust in Emily. Throughout our 2 year planning process with Emily, there was never a day where we didn’t feel like her highest priority. Taking on a limited number of weddings allows her to be intimately involved with her clients’ planning process. There were things that we mentioned once that she remembered months later. As a gay couple, we were able to bend many traditional wedding “rules” and Emily was ecstatic to embark on planning with us and help us realize a dream day that was energetic, fun, personal and most of all, reflective of the love we share. We knew nothing about weddings, and Emily was patient and held our hands every step of the way. Her checklists, documents and expert organization kept us on track and broke down everything into manageable tasks and discussions. She held to the budget we set and educated us on how the decisions we made would impact what we could do down the road, but also offered creative solutions to make things work! Emily was always available to jump on a call to answer our questions, tackle a difficult decision or take an idea that we had to the next level. She accommodated our schedules and found times that would work. Every vendor she recommended was superb and she helped assemble an A-list team that made our wedding weekend remarkable. Every detail was so well thought out and cohesive. Planning a wedding during COVID was challenging and she navigated everything with such grace and professionalism. We were so lucky that our wedding was able to proceed as planned in July of 2021 at Park Winters. On a 102 degree day, Emily made her magic happen - choreographing an organized ballet of vendors all while looking flawless. When a button popped off of John’s tuxedo jacket during photos, Emily was there to sew it back on. When the wrong meal came out for Justin, the correct meal appeared instantaneously. She even took the extra step of carving out a private moment for us after the ceremony where we could have some time together - complete with our favorite drinks and a selection of the appetizers. We were always directed to where we needed to be without paying any mind to the time or an upcoming speech or dance. With Emily running the show, we were allowed to be present in our day as we had complete trust in her. Emily designed, planned and produced a wedding that had never been done before; simply put, it was us. We heard from so many of our guests that this was the best wedding they had EVER been to. Every detail had been thought of. Everyone felt so taken care of. The design was stunning and like nothing anyone had seen before. Most importantly, it felt so personal and authentic and a true celebration of our love. There were smiles, happy tears, lots of laughs and so much joy. We have Emily to thank for all of it. We already miss hearing from her every day, but know that she will be a friend for life. She is simply a wonderful human being and we feel so grateful to have had her as our wedding planner.

Emily Coyne contacted Del Cabo Weddings eight weeks before the wedding celebration she was planning in Los Cabos, having been referred to us by Chileno Bay Resorts and Residences. ...

She was pleasant and communicative about her vision, relating details, and timelines. Before, during and after the events, Emily was truly amazing to work with! The production deck, timeline and guest look book she provided were extremely comprehensive, and, in fact, the most concise I had ever seen. Emily’s overall creativity and detail orientation were outstanding and her flexibility was that of a highly experienced professional who understands the importance of quality. It was a true pleasure to collaborate with her on this beautiful destination wedding project, and I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend Emily Coyne to clients at any time. ~ Jonathan Vega, Wedding Specialist, Del Cabo Weddings

Emily helped plan my wedding in July 2019 and I cannot recommend her services (and her as a person) more for anyone considering wedding planners. Here’s why: Tl;dr: Emily is one o...

f the best in the business who will very soon be INCREDIBLY difficult to book (or very (deservingly) expensive) so hire her ASAP. 1) THE ULTIMATE CREATIVE PARTNER: She is a thought partner who will spend hours pulling together your vision that you spoke about maybe just once (so less of a time suck on you) — and will just get it right. And if she didn’t, or if you’re still exploring what you want, she’ll also get on the phone with you Friday at 3pm to talk things out for 2 hours. After maybe just one initial meeting with Emily and a pitiful Pinterest board, she found my ideal florist (Meredith Law Design) who also ended up being such a great creative partner. 2) PUTS YOU FIRST: If you need something urgently (or just want to run an idea past her) she’ll reply to you incredibly promptly with a solution or answer — or a promise to look into it as soon as she’s back at her desk (or will even do so just on her phone). She entertains your ideas even if they’re not good — and if they’re not good, she sort of listens to what you want and provides an even better idea. I felt like I had to do so little work. And then on the wedding day there was never a moment I worried that I wasn't going to be taken care of by her. I was definitely her first priority. 3) GREAT WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS: My mom wanted to be informed about everything being planned, and Emily was so gracious including her and spending so much time answering endless questions. And then she put together a full plan for my wedding party for the weekend so they had no excuses (I didn’t even realize that was a service that was included!). On the wedding day she masterfully coordinated the wedding party and family for all the things, and all of them have said that they have never experienced as good of a planner as Emily. 4) HER ATTENTION TO DETAIL IS UNPARALLELLED: You will never stress about being behind schedule or that all the pieces haven’t been thought through METICULOUSLY. Her schedules/planning books are the envy of every planner and why so many great vendors like working with her. She also kept me very on schedule throughout the year, providing templates and guidelines for everything we could possibly think of. 4) ABOVE AND BEYOND: Before we began we had not scoped Emily to help with transportation at all. But she graciously helped us get a good rate with the bus company — so allowed us to use her connection even though she didn’t have to. There were so many times she went above and beyond that mid-way through planning the wedding weekend we realized we couldn’t plan the rehearsal dinner and farewell brunch without her!! When we included her there, she worked tremendously fast to get things together and was so lovely with my mother-in-law. Everything turned out BEAUTIFULLY. I highly recommend just hiring Emily for the entire weekend! 8) A GREAT HUMAN BEING: You spend so much time with your wedding planner, this is oddly one of the most important things to look for! Emily is the most pleasant, nicest person to be around, which made the relationship so easy. She even agreed to do a debrief with me a week after the wedding because I just needed to talk about every detail of the wedding with someone who knew everything and saw it from all angles. She was so kind to humor me.

Our daughter selected Emily for her recent wedding in Napa. Emily was detailed, calm, thoughtful, full of suggestions and ideas and made everyone's life easy, allowing the wedding...

to run smoothly. Listening to friends's experiences as mother-of-the-bride overwhelmed me with the number of details but between the bride and Emily, what was required of me was manageable. Emily answered all questions, letting us know in a timely manner what was needed from us. She also made suggestions when the scheduled makeup/hair artist was unable to work due to illness. Offering an alternative artist who was available and experienced before letting us know of the cancellation was greatly appreciated. I highly recommend Emily.

My family had the wonderful experience of working with Emily as the wedding planner for my son and daughter-in-law's recent wedding. Her logistical magic and patience throughout th...

e whole process was simply amazing. I worked primarily with Emily on planning the welcome/rehearsal dinner and the farewell brunch. Her experience, knowledge of venues and vendors, and calm and competent demeanor made planning these events a joy. Although the wedding (and Emily) were a continent away, she was always available via phone and email. We wanted the dinner to reflect New England, where the groom grew up, and the brunch China. Working closely with the bride and groom, Emily came up with so many special touches that perfectly captured the look and feel they were hoping for. She found cookies decorated with the colors and logos of the Boston sports teams close to the groom's heart, Cape Cod signs, and Chinese banners, special chopsticks, and keepsake spoons. Emily was everywhere during the wedding weekend - supervising vendors, keeping the family and wedding party on track and in communication with each other, and providing a calm, knowledgeable, and friendly presence all weekend. I don't know how many times I heard someone say, "Ask Emily!" Thank you, Emily!!

We were honored to have Emily Coyne as our wedding planner and coordinator at Auberge du Soleil in 2018. And I must say Emily Coyne is phenomenal. She is very professional yet very...

warming and sweet. Our wedding planning process was easy and we were able to enjoy every part of it. As a bride, we tend to stress out about everything whether it be the timeline, the vendors, the rehearsal, the weather .... there is always something. But with Emily, everything was smooth and stress free. She always responded to questions very quickly and if we had a concern, she listened and always provided a solution or back up. We selected and signed contacts our vendors: florist, photographer, videographer and entertainment/DJ, then Emily took care of the rest. She contacted them and discussed a timeline. She told them where to set and cued everything on time and on point. She even created a timeline for us and the wedding party so we understood what time hair and make-up occurred, photos, first looks, the ceremony, dances, etc. We had some items we wanted placed out such as a seating chart, the guest gifts, etc. She provided excellent suggestions on where they should be placed and we only had to tell her once how we wanted it and she had it down. The wedding rehearsal day only took 30 minutes. It was quick because she is just that organized and knows what she is doing. What I loved the most about Emily was that she was always thoughtful and remained calm throughout everything. When she spoke, you felt relaxed. She made sure we had a chance to enjoy our food and even made sure we were doing well during the getting ready before the ceremony. At one point, my make up artist was late and I was a bit worried that we wouldn't make it on time for photos. She calmly told me that we had plenty of time and not to worry. Everything worked out. I know this is a long review but honestly cannot say enough wonderful things about her. You all need to know! People always tell us that our wedding was marvelous and my wedding party still mentions how Emily was just fantastic. You won't be disappointed and anyone is lucky to have her assist on any special day.
