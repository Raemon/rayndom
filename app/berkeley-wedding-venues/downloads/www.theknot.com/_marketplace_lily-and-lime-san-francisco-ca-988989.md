mmunicated with us throughout the process, and Kenneth, our photographer, was outstanding. He was very accommodating and took over 4,200 photos over 8 hours! The Lily and Lime team then curated the photos for us, categorizing the best photos into Editor's Choice, Ceremony, Reception, etc. This made building the album easy for us. We highly recommend Lily and Lime and would hire them again in a heart beat!

cess effortless. The work, the pricing, and the communication are pretty transparent - it's all about what you want and need. You get to choose your photographer based on their work/your style, and you get to choose which offers fit your needs. Our pictures turned out great and our videos turned out better than I expected. It was very hot and there were a lot of activities on the day of our wedding, but the photographers, Jose and David, and the videographer, Daniel, were professional and timely. They did a great job capturing all the important, fun, and chaotic moments that take me back to the day of whenever I view or watch them.

Submitting this review for Lily & Lime San Diego here, because we cannot find an entry on the Knot for San Diego specifically. Lily & Lime is a great value with excellent customer ...

service and phenomenal photographers. My one recommendation is that they increase the amount of time that couples have access to photographer contact information from one week in advance to two weeks in advance to put clients more at ease and to meet the needs of other vendors (like coordinators). When our original lead photographer was sick and could no longer work as of two days before our wedding, Lily and Lime informed us while immediately offering a solution of making our assitant photographer the lead and adding another assitant. They also gave us a photo credit for the last minute change. Daniel did a fantastic job as our lead wedding photographer; he was patient, punctual, personable, creative, adaptive, and he elicited genuine emotion that he and his assitant photographer Kyle captured expertly throughout the day and night. Daniel went out of his way to prioritize our top shots and styles and added unique shots that only a passionate professional could have conceptualized. Daniel's photo or pose ideas are some of our favorites from our wedding day and we are so grateful to him and Kyle for stepping up/in last minute to make our dream wedding and mementos a reality. When we look at the photos they captured of our big day I tear up and feel immense joy; they are gorgeous, of exceptional quality, clarity, and color, and better than we could have envisioned or hoped for! I highly recommend Daniel for capturing any event; he is an excellent human and an expert at his craft. Hiring Daniel will be the best investment you make in your wedding/event.

My wife and I are very pleased with Lilly and Lime. They replied promptly whenever we emailed with questions prior to our wedding. They day of the wedding, our photographer arrived...

extra early to set up and check the venue. He was very flexible and accommodating. Due to traffic, we arrived late to the place we were going to use for our main portraits, so we had to improvise on the spot. The photographer was very understanding and always reassuring us that the pictures were going to come out great, which they did! My best friend who was in charge of managing the reception program also told me that the photographer was very communicative with him. He paid special attention in details, and made sure that he included good pictures of us, and our family. We couldn't have asked for a better photography company. Or lead photographer's name was Tiago. We also had an additional photographer (Samuel) who was also very professional. Thank you Lily & Lime for such a great and smooth experience during our wedding. We would highly recommend you, and use your for future events.

once wa finally got in touch with our photographer a week prior to our wedding (which is the customary time for them I was told) I was happy with our conversation. the day of our photographer arrived on time. once the wedding started we did our ceremony and started with photos. the entire day and night the photographer was a mess. she did not guide us through pictures with ease at all. we were not confident with her pictures and were unable to see them for 2 months from Lily and Lime! once we got them I cried. not a single one was angled to flatter me. they were all taken from below so my double chin was prominent. just awful. when we emailed lily and lime for edits, it took even longer and they were just for brightening photos and removing mosquitos from faces. i do not recommend this route, even though its affordable.

We're so happy we went with Lily & Lime for our wedding photography. At first, we were a bit skeptical, but we'd read such good reviews for L&L that we decided to give them a shot....

It turned out to be an excellent decision. For starters, they have top notch customer service. Staff were remarkably responsive to our emails/phone calls and always tried their best to provide whatever info we needed. We never felt like L&L was unreliable or untrustworthy, which is understandably a common concern when working with an online only company. Our photographer was Rebecca and she was awesome. Her personality and style matched what we had in mind, and she was very responsive and communicative as well. We had added a second photographer, but weren't told who they would be until about a week prior to our wedding. After working with Samuel, we can safely say, we never had anything to worry about. We loved him just as much as our main photographer. They took some great shots for us! Both photographers also worked seamlessly with our wedding venue. We didn't have to coordinate a thing after providing them with contact info. For the quality of service and photographers, you also can't beat L&L's packages. We were on a tight budget and are convinced that no other approach would have yielded this level of value. Our only real complaint is that the editing work was not the best. The way L&L works is that the photographer takes the photos, but L&L editors touch them up. It was unfortunately obvious that the editor(s) were in a rush as some of the colors were overdone while other times, it was puzzling why certain photos were even selected for editing to begin with. That being said, L&L returned over 6,000 photos to us, with around 30% of them edited. 2,000 edited photos is nothing to balk at! All in all, picking L&L to help with our wedding photography was a fantastic decision. Two thumbs up!

planning a wedding was an ordeal. Part of the reason we chose Lily and Lime was the stunning packages they were able to offer at an affordable price. Their ability to be flexible and support us during a pandemic and natural disaster was why we really love working with them. Lily and Lime's customer service support was helpful during our pandemic pivoting, giving us so many options and ideas to consider. Shout out to Nick who answered my millions of questions and scenarios quickly and thoroughly as we postponed, re-planned, and plan A for our wedding day quickly turned into plan C. We were able to pick our photographer. After looking at portfolios I knew we would connect with Rebecca. Rebecca was amazing and we connected instantly. She worked with us to creatively find solutions to take beautiful pictures in lovely locations in a safe way on a very smoky day. The skies had been orange just a few days before as our state struggled with the terrible fire, but the editors made sure the photos turned out beautifully! I would recommend Lily and Lime, especially in these uncertain times!

one but the photographer had all the genuine warmth and friendliness of going to the bank. Tons of red tape, a nigh-unusuable website, very blatantly copy-pasted responses that were the email equivalent of "Your call is very important to us. Please stay on the line, and the next available representative will be with you shortly," and we weren't even allowed to meet or contact our photographer until a week before the wedding! We had to cancel the large wedding we had planned due to COVID, and when we re-schedule (hopefully next year), we're definitely going to go with another photographer - an independent artist, not a huge, unwieldy, impersonal corporation like this.

etailed wedding plan of how we wanted the day to go, along with where they would take place. A week before, I had a call with Mike, who was our photographer. The call went well, and I explained to him that we’re an easy going group and should be a fun day. Flash forward to my bridesmaids, mom and I waiting at the hotel for 30 minutes for Mike to show up. He didn’t show, and I gave him a call. He said that he went straight to our venue, which was not in our plan. Okay, fine, we’ll get ready at the venue. Strike one. When we arrived at the venue, he was taking photos of the groomsmen and around the venue. We were able to take about 10 minutes of bridesmaids photos, not in dresses, before we had to get ready, which was now, rushed. We had to get ready fast in order to make the ceremony, and that meant, pictures after the ceremony before the reception, which was a 45 minute window, and that’s when family photos were taking place. Now we’re rushed. Strike two. Ceremony was fine, and afterwards, my planner, myself and other bridesmaids were trying to wrangle people for photos, and the photographer was nowhere to be found. He was on the back patio waiting for us with no communication. It took what seemed a lifetime to get people together. Finally it was time for grand entrance, and because we didn’t have photos of everyone in the wedding party, we had to do those after we finished eating and after toasts. Which, it’s now 7:30-8pm, with horrible lighting. I’m slightly buzzed at this point, so I think I was slightly forgiving in the moment. After this, we asked for photos the tables, and dancing. Which we got, but with heavy flash (once we got photos back). We noticed he kept disappearing through the night, and our videographer (thank god!) was there to capture the big moments for us. Flash forward to the week after our wedding, and a few friends had messaged me about some concerns from our wedding. I was really taken aback to find out that not only was he utilizing our open bar, but he was smoking weed with our guests and hanging out in the smoking area with them for a good portion of the evening during dancing. Strike three. Also, three OTHER friends, tell me that Mike, was using his PERSONAL phone and video device, to film our guests dancing. He asked several of them to “show me your goods” and “give it to me baby!”. At this point, I’m embarrassed a week after our wedding by his actions. Six weeks later, we get our photos back, only to discover that there are multiple photos of multiple guests which are close ups, of them in low cut shirts and dresses. Our family and friends. Once I heard this from everyone, saw our photos that were less than beautiful, and realized I only had ten, YES TEN, photos of my husband and I because of our photographers poor planning and not sticking to the plan this company sent us, I brought it up to Lily and Lime, and they offered us $300 dollars back from our wedding package after an “investigation” on their end. It’s a joke. They isn’t take responsibility for the actions of their photographer, who is a creep, bad photographer and didn’t stick to the plan. Believe me when I say, spend the money on a GOOD photographer with GOOD reviews.

that it would be THAT photographer on the day of the wedding. As for the videographers, there was no choice in selection. So it would've been a hit or a miss if we had gone with Lily & Lime.

I am so glad we went with Lily & Lime for our wedding photography this last summer. It was the easiest process ever, and definitely the most affordable option we found. I think we...

also got in when they were doing a special deal for an additional discount, so that was great too. At first I was a bit skeptical of the online aspect for the whole process, but it was a dream come true, and one of the easiest parts of planning our wedding. We were able to select our lead photographer from multiple photographers available on our day in the area, and we selected a great one! We even lucked out with our associate photographer that came with the package we purchased too. He was matched up with us and our lead photographer by Lily & Lime, and he was a perfect fit for us also. After we selected our package and lead photographer, everything else was just as easy. Later down the timeline our contacts at Lily & Lime reached out with a schedule/itinerary to complete with all the details of what we want included, not included, and all the special things a bride and groom might want for their big day. They were able to give me suggested time frames for certain things (ie: first look, family photos, etc), so that was extremely helpful. With the wedding a week out, I connected with our lead photographer over the phone. We chatted for about an hour, and he made me feel so comfortable with the process, and at ease, knowing we would be in good hands with him as our photographer. He understood what we wanted, and what was most and least important to us in capturing our big day, and boy did he deliver! We got all the photos from Lily & Lime within a month of the wedding, and we got a sneak peak of their top 30-ish photos a week after the wedding. There were about 2500 photos that were sent to us, and about half of them were the ones that the Lily & Lime team edited. The other half were the rest of the photos both the lead and associate photographers took, but they weren't edited by the Lily & Lime team. We appreciate that they still gave us these photos, because some of these unedited ones are our favorite! That was the only one different thing about using Lily & Lime. The photographers take all the photos, and send them directly to Lily & Lime, where their team takes them and picks the ones to edit on behalf of the photographer. So, the photographer might have had one vision in their head for a shot, that the editor might not have thought of, or noticed, but that is okay. For the price, and ease, and everything in between, I'm very pleased with Lily & Lime, and will recommend them to anyone I know that is planning a wedding in the future!
