**In this article:** Top Picks | What to Look For | Best Shorts for Under Dresses




## What to Look for in Shorts to Wear Under Dresses

Finding the best shorts for under a dress wasn't an easy task. Our team tested out countless products to find ones that we felt were wedding-worthy. So, what were the specific criteria we were judging them on? Well, coverage was one of the main things, since experts believe you need shorts with an inseam of five inches or longer to adequately prevent chafing. Knowing that weddings involve quite a bit of movement, from walking down the aisle to hitting the dance floor, we also looked for shorts that would stay in place for long periods of time without rolling down or riding up. Finally, we took note from some of our favorite [types of shapewear](https://www.theknot.com/content/what-is-shapewear) to find shorts that could smooth and sculpt the body while doing everything that we mentioned above. By looking for these key things, we were able to find some of the best slip shorts for under dresses that are on the market today.

Our readers can't seem to get enough of these shorts and it's no mystery why. Not only do they prevent chafing, but they also enhance your *assets* if you know what I mean. Designed with SKIMS' innovative Seamless Sculpt technology, they offer strong, targeted compression around the stomach and thighs while lifting and sculpting the butt.

**Standout review:** "Two major things stuck out to me the first time I put on my SKIMS shorts: They're comfortable and they stay in place wonderfully. When it comes to wearing shorts under dresses I always worry about them bunching up and feeling bulky. But these shorts keep your thighs from chafing without being cumbersome." –[Hannah Nowack](https://www.theknot.com/content/author/hannah-nowack), Senior Manager of Editorial Brand Content

**Size range:** XXS–4X | **Colors:** 8

### Best Compression Shorts for Under Dresses: Honeylove SuperPower Short

![Honeylove compression shorts for under dresses](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/dbf0767c-464c-4127-bfd2-5098366c7b8f~rs_768.h-cr_51.0.1549.1998)

_Photo: Honeylove_

If you're looking for a pair of shorts that double as [bridal shapewear](https://www.theknot.com/content/under-thewedding-dress-lingerie-essentials), these are the way to go. They offer ultra-firm support to sculpt your body without squeezing it. They have flexible boning hidden in the side seams to prevent them from rolling down or riding up throughout the day. They even have an opening in the gusset to make bathroom trips easier. (At least as easy as they can be in a wedding gown.)

**Standout review:** ""The Honeylove SuperPower Shorts were supportive, comfortable and stayed in place all day long. They didn't ride up or roll down which is always a worry with shapewear. The length of the shorts was perfect for preventing any uncomfortable chafing on my wedding day." –Emily Wise, Content Strategy Lead

### Best Anti-Chafing Shorts for Under Dresses: Thigh Society The Original Shorts

There's a reason Thigh Society's original shorts sell out so fast: They're just _that_ good. They stay in place without rolling or riding up. They've got a pocket on the side where you can keep your phone during the ceremony. Plus, they're designed to fit virtually any body type. Planning to [wear a short dress](https://www.theknot.com/content/can-you-wear-a-short-dress-to-a-wedding)? _No problem._ These come in three different lengths including a five-inch inseam option.

**Editor review:** These shorts were a total gamechanger for me this summer. I wore them under skirts and dresses during the most humid days of the year and they instantly cooled me down. On top of that, they stayed in place and didn't ride up, even after walking miles in them." –[Sofia Deeb](https://www.theknot.com/content/author/sofia-deeb), Assistant Fashion Editor

For a smooth, undetectable look under a form-fitting wedding gown, my advice is to go Commando. And no, I'm not talking about ditching your shorts altogether. Commando's Featherlight Control Shorts are so thin, they'll go totally unnoticed under your gown. Not only that, but they also offer medium to light compression to help you feel secure.

**Standout review: "** The Featherlight Control Short is like wearing the top of a pair of pantyhose. It feels like nothing but smooths out everything. They're great for all year round but especially in any hot weather." –Barbara, [wearcommando.com](https://wearcommando.com/)

Even the grandest of tulle ballgowns won't be able to stop the airflow when you're wearing these breathable shorts. They're made from a hi-tech performance fabric that pulls heat and moisture away from your body. Don't be surprised when you forget you're even wearing them.
