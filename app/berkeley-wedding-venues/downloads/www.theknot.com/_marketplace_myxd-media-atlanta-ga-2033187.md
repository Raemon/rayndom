If you don’t get Jordan & Jersey on your wedding day team, you are seriously missing out. Other than their beautiful shot skills and versatile editing styles, Myxd Media: \- Worked ...

with us at every step of the way: from budget, to editing style, to the FONT in the title shot \- Was genuinely happy to be part of our wedding day \- They actually helped us run our timeline and kept us on schedule (I don’t think that’s actually part of their job, but it was a huge blessing) \- They were true professionals in the face of all our crazy (we have a lot of crazy) If you are on the fence regarding having video at your wedding, just get on the phone with Myxd Media and chat out your concerns. If you know you want video of your wedding, just go ahead and book Jordan and Jersey… you will be over the moon.

I highly recommend MyXd Media. They recently videoed our daughters wedding and we couldn’t be happier with the results. They are an amazing duo. Jordan was present throughout the ...

entire wedding, he arrived early and honed in on so many details as a parent on a wedding day would forget or notice all the details, he captured them. I was so thankful for that. We enjoyed seeing them with the photos and videos he captured. While he was uploading Jersey was able to immediately start to edit and provide us some first glance videos and the two of them where able to communicate in such a flawless way and she was able to see were to make adjustments. They were so helpful and you didn’t even notice them there. But they captured every tender moment throughout the video. He is so talented in bringing the emotion of the day to life and we will forever treasure it. As a parent, the wedding was so emotional and goes by so fast and all the details he was able to capture and the laughter and the love meant the world to us. If you are looking for a class act company, look no further. They make such a human connection and take the time get to know what is important and really brought it all in the video. Absolutely without a doubt was more than we ever dreamed! Thank you so much!

pture all of the emotion and memories. It’s like watching the creation of a Hollywood film company, but better! He is the Best! We’ve gotten to know a little more about Jordan and have discovered he is a man of many talents, a true Renaissance man. It wasn’t a surprise to learn he’s done videos and editing for some of the best-known companies in the world and he even has his own podcast and has a large group of followers.

s. Recently, Jordan took video for Adam and Alisha’s wedding. He was early and stayed late. Helped figure out exactly what to do and what would work best. His videography took place for the rehearsal dinner, the wedding both inside and outside our beautiful church and again after the wedding Reception ceremony. Punctuality, Engaging, Easygoing, Fun to work with and Creativity are all Jordan’s strong points. You’ll love Jordan’s work!! We do!!

It’s a natural tendency when hiring someone that you have expectations. Multiply that times 100 when it has to do with a wedding and you are the bride. I was told that I needed vid...

eography to capture the special day and my husband and I decided to go with Jordan under my brother’s recommendation. I cannot imagine our wedding now without that video. In fact, it touched me so much that I almost couldn’t watch it for the first year. I would choke up crying and walk out of the room when showing it to family and friends. You know how brides ALWAYS have suggestions after their wedding? I tell every girl about to be married to hire a videographer to capture the essence of the day. Skip flowers, skip live music, and hire a someone to film the occasion. Better yet, hire Jordan. I cannot imagine anyone else who could capture everyone’s personalities in such a beautiful and romantic way. Thank you Jordan for having our day last for a lifetime.
