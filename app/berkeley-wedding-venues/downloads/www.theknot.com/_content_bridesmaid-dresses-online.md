As a rom-com fanatic who religiously watched all the best wedding movies in the early 2000s, I thought my life as an adult would look a lot like Katherine Heigl's in _27 Dresses_. Now, I'm relieved that it doesn't…not only because my closet space couldn't allow it, but also because the entire experience of shopping for bridesmaid dresses online has evolved (for the better, that is). While bridesmaid dresses once had a reputation as being outfits you'd never wear again, that's hardly the case today. Thanks to the rise in mismatched bridal parties and increased flexibility in selecting individual patterns, colors and silhouettes, it's not all that uncommon to find a bridesmaid dress online that you actually will rewear (either to another wedding or to brunch with your besties). Of course, this presents the ultimate question: What _are_ the best bridesmaid dress websites? 

As an editor at The Knot *and* a bridesmaid IRL, I've spent quite a lot of time browsing retailers, trying on different styles and seeing designs in some of these brands' headquarters. That's why I'm uniquely qualified to present this list of the top bridesmaid dress sites. I've scoured the internet for stores that offer the best of the best: the best quality, the best shipping and return policies, the best customer service, the best reviews, and, of course, the best variety. Because, as we know, no two weddings are the same, meaning no two bridesmaid dresses are the same either. 

FEATURED VIDEO FROM THE KNOT

Whether you're a member of the wedding party or a bride-to-be in search of options for your 'maids, browse my curation of the best places to buy bridesmaid dresses online right now, complete with notes on size ranges and price points. Plus, read up on a few must-know shopping tips to help you (or your friends) make the most confident purchase.

_Photo: Rent the Runway_

**Why The Knot loves this brand** : Here's the deal. Renting your bridesmaid dress may _sound_ great in theory, but rental companies offer subscription boxes for a limited time.

**Why you'll love this brand:** Rent the Runway's catalog is constantly updated with the latest styles directly, well, from the runway.

## Tips for Shopping Bridesmaid Dresses Online

Determining where to get bridesmaid dresses is just one piece of the puzzle. To make shopping for online bridesmaid dresses as seamless as possible, there are a few other tips and tricks to keep in mind. 

### Know your measurements and review size guides.

If you're planning to attend a virtual or in person styling appointment, you'll want to come prepared. Having your measurements ready to go can help narrow down your options so that you find the right dress faster. Even if you aren't working with a consultant, bear in mind that bridesmaid sizes may differ from your regular dress size. Use our guide on [how to measure for a dress at home](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-to-take-dress-measurements-at-home). Once you know your numbers, carefully read the size guide on the site to make sure you're getting the correct fit.

### Purchase your dress at least six months in advance.

When shopping for bridesmaid dresses online, gowns have the potential to sell out, _especially_ during peak wedding season. To avoid having to show up to the wedding in a dress you're less than thrilled about, shop ahead of schedule. If you're wondering [when to get your bridesmaid dress](https://www.theknot.com/content/ultimate-bridesmaid-dress-guide), our advice is to start your search as early as possible. Plan to purchase at least six months in advance of the wedding date. If you're the bride, aim to select your dresses (or tell your crew what colors or patterns to buy) at least eight months in advance to give them ample time to order.

Even if the dress you're eying is fully-stocked, it's better to air on the side of caution and save yourself from avoidable stress by getting your dress as soon as you can. Remember: Bridesmaid gowns are not always the perfect fit, and you may need to factor in additional time for exchanges or alterations.

### Order swatches when possible.

Many bridesmaid dress brands can send [fabric swatches](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridesmaid-dress-fabric) or dress samples for free or for a small fee. I highly recommend taking advantage of this perk, especially if you're trying to coordinate [mismatched bridesmaid dresses](https://www.theknot.com/content/mismatched-bridesmaids-dress-tips). Seeing the fabric in person can make or break your decision when it comes to choosing the right bridesmaid dress. While this is more commonly done by brides, bridesmaids can also check out fabric swatches before purchasing to make sure a gown is *the one*.
