Deciding what you'll wear on your wedding day is a major decision, but figuring out how to dress your wedding party is equally important. Not only do you want your friends to look amazing, but you also want them to feel like themselves. Luckily, the top bridesmaid dress ideas for 2025 give you and your crew plenty of options and can work with virtually any [wedding style](https://www.theknot.com/wedding-vision).

Rewearability is top of mind for many 2025 to-be-weds thinking about what bridesmaid dress styles to choose. According to Yuliia Lobachova, founder of [Yuliia Lobachova](https://yuliialobachova.com/) and [Ricca Sposa](https://riccasposa.com/about-us/), "Bridesmaid dresses in 2025 will be more than just a reflection of current trends; they will be expressions of individuality," she says. "Today's couples want their bridesmaids to not only look elegant, but also feel comfortable and confident in a dress that reflects their personal style."

FEATURED VIDEO FROM THE KNOT

"What we've been seeing year after year is that there are fewer 'rules' around how to dress your bridal party. For modern weddings, variety will be the driving force behind bridesmaid looks," says Grace Lee Chen, founder and CEO of [Birdy Grey](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=9ibcrDa*U1o&mid=44848&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.birdygrey.com%2F&u1=tk-new-bridesmaid-dress-trends%7Cxid:fr1732311051556igb). "You can't go wrong with a tried-and-true uniform look, but more groups are opting to mix between fabrics, hemlines and really having fun with the palette in lieu of a matchy-matchy vibe."

As for popular [bridesmaid dress colors](https://www.theknot.com/content/what-color-bridesmaid-dresses-should-you-have), neutral shades like champagne, taupe and black are only going to pick up steam this year, Lee Chen says, as well as versatile and simple silhouettes that can be worn again outside of the bridesmaid role. Because of this shift to wearability, "we're going to see more cocktail and evening wear satin gowns at weddings," she explains. In terms of unexpected trends, 2025 is predicted to bring a rise in patterned bridesmaid gowns (but we'll dive deeper into that later). 

Whatever you're in the market for, these five bridesmaid dress styles are a great place to start. Keep reading to get a first look at the most popular [bridesmaid dresses](https://www.theknot.com/fashion/bridesmaid-dresses) for 2025 weddings, then shop our personal favorites for each trend.

Solid-colored gowns may have dominated the bridesmaid fashion scene in previous years, but moving into 2025, couples are getting more comfortable experimenting with patterns. Floral gowns in particular have quickly become some of the trendiest types of bridesmaid dresses. "Everything from subtle floral prints to big, bold placed prints are looking more fabulous than ever," says Andrea Louie Brown, Divisional Merchandise Manager at [Anthropologie](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=9ibcrDa*U1o&mid=39789&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anthropologie.com%2F&u1=tk-new-bridesmaid-dress-trends) Weddings. "If you're feeling shy about incorporating florals, you can start with tone-on-tone prints and mix them with coordinating solid shades. If you're feeling more daring, you have the freedom to go as wild as you'd like and mix and match different prints of varying tones and scales," says Lee Chen. The world of [floral bridesmaid dresses](https://www.theknot.com/content/floral-bridesmaid-dresses-to-shop) is seemingly endless, but lucky for you, we've scoured the websites of the best [bridesmaid dress brands](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridesmaid-dresses-online) and hand-selected a few of our favorite styles for 2025.

Like we said earlier, there are no rules when it comes to your wedding party's attire, and that means they don't have to wear matching outfits if that's not your vibe. According to Louie Brown, today's couples want their bridesmaids to be celebrated, to feel comfortable and to stay true to their individual styles. "This is why we're seeing wedding parties push the [mismatched bridesmaid dresses](https://www.theknot.com/content/mismatched-bridesmaids-dress-tips) trend forward by playing with patterns, textures and colors." she adds. 

"Mixing and matching bridesmaid dresses gives each member of your group the ability to pick a style that they feel beautiful and confident in," says Nayri Kalayjian, founder of [Wedding Fashion Expert](https://weddingfashionexpert.com/). To execute this type of group look, Kalayjian says you'll want to do a bit of preparation first. "I do think it's essential for the couple to give their bridesmaids some direction, guidelines and inspiration for choosing a dress, along with approving each bridesmaid's selection so there are no unforeseen surprises on wedding day," she adds. "Communication is key here to have the overall look and feel you're wanting to achieve on your wedding day." 

So, if you're looking to coordinate mismatched dresses, where do you begin? "For solids, choose a family of colors or a tone (like muted shades, brights or pastels). For floral prints, it's easiest to start with a print you love and look for colors that show up in the print as a throughline," says Lee Chen. For even more inspiration, check out the sage green ensemble we've laid out below.

Okay, okay—you may have seen this trend in last year's roundup. But according to Lee Chen, neutrals are here to stay. "They're just such a great option for people who are looking for a classic, timeless aesthetic. Not to mention, they look so luxurious." Kalayjian says.

"A natural color palette subtly shifts the attention to the couple, ensuring they stand out against the bridal party," she adds. "Simple, timeless, chic, elegant and clean are words we hear our couples say when describing the attire they want for their bridal party." Of course, [neutral bridesmaid dresses](https://www.theknot.com/content/neutral-bridesmaid-dresses) would be the first thing to come to mind for any stylist when they hear those words. Want to embrace this minimalist trend on your big day? We've rounded up a few of our favorite shoppable options below.

"In 2025, the cut of the bridesmaid dress will be just as important as the fabric," says Lobachova. Good news: That means [midi bridesmaid dresses](https://www.theknot.com/content/midi-bridesmaid-dresses) are now totally acceptable options for your group (not that they ever weren't, but you catch our drift). "Midi, tea-length, and ankle-length dresses are a fun way for your bridesmaids to show off a novelty heel, plus they feel really fresh and modern," adds Lee Chen.

Shorter dresses are also ideal for weddings with a more casual dress code. Of course, when dressed up with [bridesmaid accessories](https://www.theknot.com/content/accessorizing-your-bridesmaids), they can work just as well for semi-formal and cocktail events too. Marco Marrero and María Díaz of [Marco and María](https://marcoymaria.com/en/) believe that a mid-length bridesmaid dress is one of the most versatile choices for your group. "You can wear them both during the day and at night, depending on the shoes you choose. Plus, we think this length highlights femininity in a very elegant way." Looking to have your bridal party sport this trend? Kalayjian has some advice. "The one thing to note with midi and tea-length dresses is that you'll probably want to coordinate shoes," she says. After all, they'll be showing. For more inspiration, check out the four shoppable looks we've rounded up below.
