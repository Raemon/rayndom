We can’t thank Stephanie at Quintana Events enough for helping put together our special day. The whole wedding planning experience with her was so much fun. From every vendor recom...

mendation to all the zoom meetings, she figured out our vision and made it come to life. Everything turned out better than expected and it was all so seamless. We appreciate all her guidance and patience, we truly don’t know how we could have done this without her. It was the most perfect day and it was all thanks to her and the Quintana team!

Hiring Quintana Events was, without a doubt, the best investment we made for our wedding. From our very first meeting with our planner Heather Gould, we knew we were in incredibly ...

capable hands. Heather is a complete professional—she is extremely organized, calm, and proactive, yet she manages to make even the most tedious parts of wedding planning enjoyable and fun! When we started the process, we were a very indecisive couple with only a general, vague idea of what we wanted. Heather is an absolute visionary. She helped us narrow down, shape, and refine our ideas into a gorgeous wedding that truly felt like us. She excels at helping indecisive couples make key, beautiful decisions while remaining completely patient throughout. For example, we struggled tremendously with finalizing our table scapes. Heather quickly stepped in, put together a few brilliant combinations, and helped us make a final selection that came together perfectly. She kept us on track without ever making us feel rushed or stressed. On the wedding day, Heather was a force of calm. She ensured every detail was executed flawlessly, and our entire day went incredibly smoothly. We truly had such a wonderful, stress-free wedding, and it would not have been possible without her expertise. Beyond our experience, our families loved Heather, and our friends couldn't stop commenting on how amazing she was. We cannot thank her enough and highly recommend her to any couple looking for a planner who is not only a seasoned professional but also an absolute joy to work with!

We can't recommend Quintana Events highly enough - and neither can anyone we talked to throughout the entire wedding planning process! We found our venue first (the stunning and dr...

eamy Seven Branches in Sonoma) and they recommended Quintana for planning & coordination services. With Quintana on board, the process of finding and consulting with the rest of our vendors could not have been easier or less stressful. We were constantly reassured that we were in good hands, and we felt it. Our wedding day ended up having some weather complications that could have been stressful, but Alex and Paris handled everything so perfectly that I wasn't even aware of the concerns happening in real time. They easily handled last minute adjustments and even ended up saving us a little money by being creative and collaborative with our venue. There were a few things like that - above and beyond, just to be nice, just to make us feel taken care of - that really made our experience special. I'm not exaggerating when I say that I didn't feel a moment of stress on our wedding day, and Quintana is to thank for that. We're so grateful, and we agree with what seemingly every wedding professional in Sonoma told us--Alex is the best!

ies leading up to the day. Alex always remained calm, collected, and in control--even when I wasn't! Not only did he recommend an amazing team of vendors, he also executed our design vision flawlessly (even finding a way to cover a curtain I found ugly in our reception space, no questions asked). Over the two years of planning, Alex was always communicative and available, making the planning process fun and easy--Alex made us feel like no ask was too big, and any frustrations were totally valid. He also really made us feel special and comfortable on the wedding day itself. He was hyping us up in pictures, letting the mother of the bride be a part of the table setting, and constantly bringing us tissues. For an easy, special, and perfect wedding, you must choose Quintana Events!

grateful that they agreed to take on our wedding, despite it being outside their usual Sonoma/Napa territory. However, their expertise and connections made it seem like they organize weddings in Paso Robles regularly. They effortlessly guided us through every step, ensuring we stayed on schedule while always emphasizing that it was our day and our decisions mattered most. Their exceptional attention to detail was evident throughout the process. They not only listened to our needs but also helped us stay within our budget by presenting a wide range of options. Our entire wedding party and guests couldn't stop raving about how flawlessly everything was executed. Thanks to Quintana Events, the day of our wedding was stress-free, allowing us to fully enjoy every moment without any worries. We are truly grateful to have had such an amazing team by our side.

The entire Quintana Events team absolutely blew our expectations away! Our planner, Kate, was nothing short of phenomenal. She showcased not only her expertise in the Sonoma / Napa...

area but also an incredible knack for understanding our vision and making it come to life. Navigating through vendor choices can be overwhelming, but Kate provided invaluable feedback which made things much simpler and more in line with what we wanted. Our wedding day was magical, seamless, and most importantly, the happiest day of our lives. Kate's dedication, passion, and meticulous attention to detail ensured that every moment was perfect. We cannot thank Quintana Events and especially Kate enough for making our dreams come true.

is warm and caring. We have worked with him over the past 3+ years as the wedding needed to be postponed due to Covid. Throughout that time Alex's calm optimism and his attention to detail saw us through the normal ups and downs that came with planning a wedding during this rather turbulent time, though actually there were not a lot of downs due to Alex's guidance and foresight at every stage of the process. He helped us put together a great team of vendors and helped us find a new venue when we needed to. He is wonderful to work with, direct and honest and open to finding new creative solutions when issues arose. He was always available to answer questions and concerns and coordinated working with vendors and the venue. The wedding was fantastic and went off without a hitch. Due to Alex and his team we were able to just enjoy the wedding and celebrate without worrying about anything! My daughter and son-in-law were absolutely thrilled! Alex has become an honorary member of our family and we are so grateful to him and his team. I cannot recommend him more highly!

He worked so well with the staff at the winery, thought of everything (outlets, generators, etc.) that we never would have thought to look into, and gave great advice throughout. Truly we could not have done this event without Alex and the Quintana events team. The day was beyond anything I could have ever imagined and Alex took care of all the problems that came up on the day of -- I honestly had no stress the day of and was able to fully enjoy my wedding. Working with Alex feels like working with a best friend -- I felt like I could ask him anything and he was always available for last minute talks or reassurance. I will truly miss our frequent check-ins and will DEFINITELY be looking to hire him again for any event that needs planning! Furthermore, Alex has an excellent reputation with the most popular vendors in Napa Valley and everyone we worked with on our vendor team was always quick to compliment Alex!

My mother, to this day, comments on how easy the clean up was when the night was over (she was responsible for coordinating the clean up at my older sister's wedding). It was organized and efficient. My husband and I really loved working with Alex. I recommend him 150%.

ning an entire wedding to then having to re plan the wedding AGAIN due to wildfires in August/ September 2020. We are incredibly grateful for all that Heather had done for us. Heather helped us plan our dream wedding in Sonoma for late August 2020 a lot of other planners may have thought it would be easier for them and the couple to cancel but Heather was open for any challenge that we brought here. AMAZING. We had to re plan an entire wedding to meet 2020s COVID guidelines. then just to top it off had to re plan again due to wildfires in late September. All in All I highly recommend Heather and Alex for any event, wedding or get together you want to have. They are problem solvers, nice, have an amazing eye for design and will make what you want happen and if what you want doesn't look the best or may not be logical they will give you the best possible option. Grateful for this company. Heather was helpful with planning, telling us the best vendors in the North Bay and the best vendors that would fit our style. She helped us with timelines, she also stayed on us for those timelines. Life gets busy and we would not have had anything close to our dream wedding doing these things on our own. Thank you!

I couldn't be more thankful for the Quintana Events Team! Our wedding was originally planned for October 2020... as the months passed by & COVID continued to get worse, Alex made s...

ure to keep in touch & talk us through all our options. Ultimately, we decided to postpone our big wedding to October 2021. Alex was such a huge help with informing all our vendors & making the postponement so much easier than I could have imagined. But the thing was... we still wanted to get legally married this year! After chatting with Alex, he told us that some couples were doing a "minimony" this year to officially tie the knot before the big party next year. Once we found a rental home that would work, Alex helped create a whole new rental order, and recommended vendors for catering, florals & photography. *On the day-of, Alex & Stephanie went above & beyond with their duties & COVID precautions. They not only acted as the planner making everything run smoothly, but also managed the music (since we didn't have a DJ), and set up all the rentals/dining tables/personal decor. I am so looking forward to working with the Quintana Team for our big celebration next year, & feel so good knowing we are in the best of hands. (*Note: we only had 12 guests on the day-of since that's all that was allowed in Sonoma at the time, and us & all our guests got tested beforehand)

shifting plans, our situation was much harder than a normal wedding planning job. Heather was such a great partner and helped us navigate re-scheduling, canceling, and then ultimately putting together a small backyard wedding. Our original plan was to have our wedding in April 2020 for roughly 130 guests. We had to quickly re-schedule to later in the year. Heather was a superstar in giving us advice and checking with all our vendors on what new date will work for everyone. She also gave us advice on how to communicate to our guests the new plans and then ultimately uninviting 90% of our guest list (everyone was so understanding!). We put together a small backyard wedding in the end and did most of the setup for rentals ourselves. Even though we didn't have Heather onsite for our wedding day (wanted to reduce the number of people together), she provided a very detailed outline for the day of and facilitated most of the rental and flower drop offs. We felt very confident in running the rehearsal and wedding day itself on our own only because of all the work Heather did for us! We highly recommend working with Quintana Events!

My husband and I are so happy to have worked with Quintana events for our 2020 wedding! Like many couple this year we had to change/cancel our original wedding (planned for July) ...

which involved a big celebration with friends and family. It was heartbreaking. We were so excited to move forward as husband and wife and hated that the uncertainty with the world and Covid was derailing our plan. With no real timeline for when we could reschedule our big wedding, we decided to look into some elopement options. Quintana Events had just what we were looking for!!! Alex and his team created beautiful wine country elopement packages. There was a few simple and thoughtful options for venues, flowers etc. For a bride, still disappointed from our spoiled plans, this was just what I needed. I didn't want to spend time agonizing over the details, so I was so grateful that Quintana Events had already thought about everything for me. In addition to making these amazing elopements happen, Alex was also extremely patient with me. I was hesitant to make new plans, or set another date as there was a lot of emotion for me in doing this. We had to come to terms with the fact most of family (with the exception of our parents) would not be there. As well, we were at the mercy of any county or state Covid restrictions that were changing daily. Alex understood these dilemmas and held our date for months, before we made the final decision to move forward. We couldn't be happier it all worked out, and that we had the help of Quintana Events!

Oh my gosh. Alex and the team at Quintana Events went ABOVE and BEYOND for our wedding. I can't recommend them enough!!!! First off, we got married at a vineyard in Sonoma the week...

end following the massive, 3-day planned PG&E power outage. We had no idea whether the power would come back on at our venue, the hair salon, the welcome dinner, our Airbnb, or anywhere by the day of the wedding. We NEEDED contingency plans. Alex was right on that! He made sure to figure out what the Plan B was before he even called us to let us know there might be an issue, so that we didn't have to worry. He helped us find a backup for our welcome dinner - which he didn't even help us plan! - and for our hair and makeup. He coordinated with ALL of our vendors to make sure everything would work out ok, and kept us updated on developments promptly and professionally the entire time. It was nerve-racking, but without Alex I really think we would have been completely underwater and overwhelmed. He was a life saver, and me and my family are SO grateful for his tireless help. On the day of the wedding (luckily the power came back on), Alex and the team were professional, cheerful, and organized in helping us get around and get ready. Everything went so seamlessly, and the venue looked beautiful! Alex has been so wonderful since the start. He is so willing to answer any questions, is prompt at replying to all emails, and is just a joy to work with. If you need a wedding coordinator in the area, GO WITH QUINTANA EVENTS. Hands down the best decision we made.

Alex had a checklist to work from, he provided recommendations for vendors, he coordinated everything and he made our wedding day so very easy, we didn't have to worry about a thing and he was just there in the background making everything happen. He also kept us on track which was HUGE in minimizing any stress before and all of the way to the wedding day. Not only did Alex do a great job he and his team were also just great people to work with. You guys rock!! Thank you so much Alex, we had a blast working with you! Dana and Beau

ons or assist with anything we needed help with! We planned our destination Napa wedding all the way from Chicago and Alex did a great job of keeping us informed and managing our planning timeline. It probably didn't help that I had a million and one questions/requests, but he didn't skip a beat and never made us feel like we were behind on anything. On the weekend of our wedding, Alex and team did a GREAT job managing the flow of events and telling our families where to be and when. From getting ready until the end of the reception, they made sure everything flowed perfectly. As a matter of fact, our venue and other vendors all said we were in good hands with Alex as our point person! I would definitely recommend Quintana Events to any bride and groom.

Alex and his team were absolutely amazing! Alex worked with me from day one, a year and a half out, to help me plan my perfect wedding. My venue had to be changed 3 days before...

my actual wedding due to the wild fires in Sonoma, and despite all of the craziness going on, Alex and his team got together and helped me to still have the wedding of my dreams. In just 2 days they found me a beautiful new venue! They contacted all of my vendors and ensured they would be able to change locations with me as well. They eased all of my worries, and in the end, they put together a wedding that was more perfect than I could have ever hoped for. I honestly wouldn't have been able to have my wedding if it was for Alex and his amazing team. I really can't thank them enough! =)

Alex came highly recommended to us through several companies - our vineyard, our caterer, even our DJ and we can see why. Alex was our day of planner, but he went above his role to...

ensure everything was going to run smoothly. Alex touched base with us multiple times throughout the planning and was always available to help! He came with suggested vendors to work with and made sure they worked with our budget, which was extremely helpful. We were told even if something goes wrong at your wedding you will never even know having Alex by your side, which is in fact true. Our day felt perfect (in our eyes) and that was thanks to Alex for keeping everything in line, running smoothly and also having such a positive and calm attitude throughout the entire process. We would highly suggest working with Alex if you are looking for a planner!! We already miss talking to him about our wedding plans :)

They led our rehearsal the day prior and on the day of they attended to our every need and want. They are amazing people to work with and were perfect from beginning to end. So thankful to have such a great team by our side for our special day!

We were married at Olympia's Valley Estate in Sonoma County this past September and Alex and his team couldn't have been more amazing to work with. They were knowledgeable, organiz...

ed, proactive but never pushy. They were professional, personable, and very relaxed. Alex has built strong relationships with vendors in all categories. To a person, unsolicited, every vendor we spoke with, told us how much they enjoyed and looked forward to working with Alex and his team. Believe me - this is an incredibly reassuring thing to hear over and over about the person who is helping you plan one of the most important days of your life. Each vendor he recommended suited our style so well and complimented the relaxed vibe we wanted for our wedding day. Our "Day Of" coordinator, Tiffany, possessed a perfect combination of calm, precision, organization and humor. We had worked with both Tiffany and Alex leading up to the wedding day so she was completely familiar and up-to-speed with every little detail. She also did a great job of making sure I kept up with our wedding "to do" timeline. Guest after guest came up to us to let us know how they felt that our whole day was beautiful, personal and that everything felt so relaxed, especially the bride and groom! Alex's experience, confidence and his apparent inability to get ruffled was exactly what I needed in a wedding planner. After our first meeting with Alex, my now husband and I were both sold. Now, after the fact, we are 100 percent certain that we couldn't have chosen any better.

r venders and were able to explain why they recommended who they did based on their knowledge of us. And every vender had wonderful things to say about them. Our planning calls with them were fun and stress free. They gave us a great timeline and made sure we were on schedule. I usually have a hard time handing things over but they made it easy and they made sure to take care of the extras that we may never have thought of. It was great having them there to let us know what we needed to think about next. As for the day of the wedding I never noticed anything wrong and will never know if anything did! Lacey and team was on top of everything and the place looked fantastic! Thank you Lacey and Alex, we had so much fun and we had some many people tell us how much fun they had.

I hired Alex to be my Wedding Coordinator because my venue required us to have a day of coordinator. I wasn't too pleased that I was going to have to spend $$ on one more thing si...

nce as we all know weddings are expensive. I can honestly say (and I don't say anything I don't mean esp being a NY chick) the best decision that I made for my wedding was hiring Alex. I only hired him as a day of Wedding Coordinator but he was there the whole way when I was planning the wedding. I live out in NorCal with no friends or family and Alex was always available by phone or e-mail for consultation on decisions on vendors or just a second opinion. I decided I wanted rental furniture and lighting and making the decisions on those items were overwhelming due to the cost and haven't to rely on my own imagination. Alex attended the meetings with me and helped me to design a lounge atmosphere that I could not be decisive on. A few weeks before the wedding, I had a major freak out about the photographers and wanted to fire them (long story). I e-mailed Alex and he called me immediately to talk through my concerns about the photographers. It wasn't until the end of the conversation he mentioned to me he had pulled over on the way back from SoCal. In that converation he was able to talk me down and come up with a plan of action that would ease my fears. On the day of the wedding, Alex was there to talk to me in just the right way when there were situations that were less than perfect. He did have the pleasure of breaking the news to me that some of the furniture that showed up to the venue was not what I wanted. Normally, I know and my now husband that was standing next to me knew, I would have kind of freaked out. Alex had just the right way speaking to a (mostly very uptight) Bride that is extremely calming especially when presented with errors of the day. I am very strict when it comes to time and it was sooo important to me that we stay on schedule. The bus with all my guests weren't at the venue 15 minutes after the wedding was suppose to start. My mom and bridesmaids saw me stressing and tried to calm me which I think was making me more annoyed. Alex came in and said something totally calming and I was fine. The day commenced eventually and Alex was my go to person. He was very behind the scenes (think totally not David Tutera). I like to joke he was like a Ninja. I have to say my parents, especially my dad didn't understand the need of a Wedding Coordinator but thought Alex was extremely professional and was so happy he was there for the entire day. Most of my guests told me that it was the best wedding that they ever went to and then followed it by saying "I'm not just telling you because it was your wedding." I owe a lot of that credit to Alex. He executed the day almost flawlessly and when there were bumps he managed the Bride (me) VERY well. I reccommend a Wedding Coordinator to every Bride now after Alex but I only hope that all Coordinators are as professional, organized, involved and soothing as Alex.
