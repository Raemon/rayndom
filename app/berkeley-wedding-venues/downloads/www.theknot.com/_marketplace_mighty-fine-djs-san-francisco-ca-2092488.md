Aaron Francisco

DJ / Owner / Experience Curator

DJ Aaron Francisco has a client list that stretches from Salesforce- Dreamforce, to Capitol Records, Guess, Box, SF Magazine, and Mayor Willie Brown, to.. you! He started out making mixtapes for his cousins at age 10, getting on the mic in between popular songs heard on the radio and MTV. He began collecting records before he ever owned a record player. For him, DJing followed as a natural progression. Hailing from a diverse musical background in San Francisco, his early influences included genres ranging from psychedelic rock to underground hip hop; from the Beatles to Bob Marley, The Cure to 2pac, and everything in between. From his days as a local party starter playing all-vinyl sets in college, he's continued to hone his skills- whether it's playing to a packed club, festival, or once-in a lifetime wedding. He's known for his ability to read and engage with the crowd, and makes it a point to get everyone on the floor- having the time of their lives.

eading to a post ceremony parade, leading to a cocktail hour & reception with multiple sound systems where choreographed dances opened up other spaces in the venue - and everything we wanted to happen, aaron made happen!! we originally reached out to aaron for those funky disco back beats he has in his mixes (we love a purple disco machine -esque dance party) and yet we were even more impressed when during the actual dance party, he transitioned between genres so effectively (from beyonce to love shack to chop suey?! and the guests went WILD). he kept the energies so high that by the time he called last song i was like wait what?! no! hire him!

h transition was just so smooth and seamless, even across different genres of music. I mean it everyone from the kids to the adults to the older folks were grooving and just having the time of their lives. I kept looking up the songs he was playing to save them on Spotify so I could listen to them again. It's so cool to witness such a talented artist with so much joy in what he does. He made our family reunion so special and memorable. I'd love to hire him in the future!

g through to the wedding night. He spent time really learning the couple’s preferences and even included a “no” section on the worksheet to list music they definitely did not want on their special night which I thought was great in understanding their needs and delivering an amazing set/night. He was able to appeal to wedding guests from several generations and delivered a great musical soundtrack for this special night. The couple was super happy and Aaron nailed the flow of music to speeches and special dances with ease. While we did work with a specialized lighting vendor, it was so helpful that Aaron was able to bring everything needed to make the room sound great. All the speakers and DJ equipment, microphones, etc. I would definitely hire Mighty Fine again!

you get. Aaron is a master DJ who took our vision and guidance songs to create a set that was better than we could've imagined - smooth transitions, great flow, and kept the energy up late into the night - dance floor was packed the whole time! Aaron was also able to coordinate a sax player to join in, and Daniel's accompaniment was also a game-changer, bringing a touch of masterful live performance to the range that Aaron was spinning. Could not recommend more!
