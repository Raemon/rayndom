We had our wedding at Carneros in the fall of 2024, and it was an absolute dream! After our initial tour of the venue, we had our fingers crossed that the estimate would be within ...

our budget, and we were ecstatic when it was. The service from start to finish was amazing. Jessica, our event manager, was incredibly helpful, knowledgeable, and truly a pleasure to work with. The catering service was prompt and professional, and the food and drinks were incredible. The property itself is so gorgeous and luxurious, whether it's the venue spaces or the accommodations. It truly felt like a "wine country" wedding and was the perfect location for our intimate, romantic ceremony and reception. I don't know if people were just being kind, but we had guests saying it was the best wedding food and most gorgeous venue they've experienced. I cannot recommend Carneros enough, and we are so incredibly grateful for everyone and everything there.

Carneros’s breath taking Napa views was why we chose this as our venue location last October. Fair warning-they are hard to communicate with and be prepared to have your final quot...

e be almost doubled when you first inquired…yes we knew this was going to be an expensive wedding..but we communicated many time ahead what would this cost and so on forth. If you want elite good choices be prepared to spend an additional $15-$20 per plate. Alcohol packages come in tiers. Highly recommend shutting the bar down when you eat and serve wine during dinner. What made us mad was when we put down our final payment we asked verbatim is this it. We don’t want to write another check or have a charge later on after the wedding. Go figure a week after our wedding we were charged $8,000 for the wedding cottages which again we asked before to pay ahead of time and to be included in everything before the wedding. For a luxury venue you’d think they would have it more together. Regardless we loved how our wedding turned out and the compliments we got were well worth the stress that was behind the scenes. My advise is to be persistent with these guys and don’t let them upsell you more than you need too

We loved our venue - we just had our wedding here a few days ago, and could not have asked for a more perfect experience. We selected this venue for the food (unbelievable qualit...

y for the number of people they are cooking for) and the flow of events. We loved the Arbor, where we did our ceremony, as well as the courtyard and ballrooms. The cocktails and wine were super tasty - you couldn't go wrong with anything, and even the default chairs were great. We were able to go until 12:30am, which is such a rarity in Napa. The staff was super friendly and accommodating as well. Everyone we worked with was super on top of it and professional. Jessica was super responsive, and the Carneros team gave us a ton of peace of mind. June is a beautiful time of year to get married here, since everything is blooming and stunning. You do need to stay on site, but that ended up working out perfectly with how the day played out! No venue in Napa is going to be "cheap," but we think we got an amazing value for what we paid for our 175 guests (again, a rarity in Napa that they can accommodate this number of people). Would a million times do it over again here at Carneros, and we loved it so much! We would love to return and hope our other friends have their weddings here as well so that we can eat the food here again :)

eros Resort and Spa had an elopement package where they took care of everything from the flowers to the photographer to the officiant to the music. Jessica was amazing to work with. She quickly put us in contact with all our venders who worked with us to make our special day exactly what we wanted. We loved every single vendor they found for us and cannot say enough good things about each of them. Not only did Jessica and her team make the planning process so smooth and stress-free, they also made the day of our wedding a dream. Everyone was so kind, the food and drinks were phenomenal, and you can't beat the location! I wish we could do it all again!

I never thought I would have to leave a negative review of my wedding venue. The property is beautiful and we had a wonderful day. But five weeks after our wedding, the front desk ...

charged our credit card nearly $10,000. We only gave the front desk our credit card for incidentals when we checked in as hotel guests because we had already paid the estimated cost of our wedding. After charging us, Carneros provided a bill with a room rate three times greater than the rate agreed to in our contract and an alcohol bill that averaged 11 drinks per guest, which we know is incorrect. Carneros has been unwilling to honor the contracted-for room rate or provide support for that inconceivable level of consumption. We have been trying to resolve this with management for four months, and the GM has been unresponsive. We are beyond surprised that this has been our experience after hosting our wedding at Carneros, and we doubt this is an isolated incident. We don’t want anyone else to go through this!

On the plus side, the food is great, and the resort is beautiful in terms of the outdoor areas, but the indoor reception rooms are outdated and not special. What sold me on Carnero...

s was the outdoor space and the hilltop dining room. The Sonoma and Napa ballrooms are just basically meeting spaces. They charge an arm and a leg to have a wedding there, and promise very high end service, but I was really disappointed and feel that other brides should be aware of some potential issues with Carneros as a wedding venue: 1\. You will still pay for your own room at the hotel. They didn't comp my room. Literally everyone else I know had their own room comped when staying at their own wedding venue. 2\. They won't give you discounted rooms for your guests. At most, they'll give a few rooms at 5% off (and with rooms starting at around $875-$975/night, your guests will likely choose one of many other Napa resorts to stay in, so it's not ideal that you can't stay with your out of town guests if you stay there). 3\. They won't save you a piece of your own wedding cake. Totally bizarre. I didn't even get to taste it and assumed they'd send us home with at least a slice, but nada. 4\. They'll dismantle your decor in the middle of the wedding. My table setup, including all decor and flowers I paid thousands for, were broken down with hours left in my reception. I was livid. They didn't even save my flowers for me -- we saw them cutting them into smaller vases to use presumably at the restaurant. 5\. They won't serve food during speeches. I don't know why they refused to do this, so once the speeches were over, everyone was looking around like, "Where's the food?" No one could explain why they insisted on this awkward pause instead of quietly sweeping the room to serve the next course while everyone is listening to the speech, so that it's ready to eat without a time lag in between. 6\. They order their tables and chairs from an outside vendor, so watch out for limited availability and time. I was told we can't have a sweetheart table indoors at the reception because they only have one and it would be used for the outdoor dinner beforehand. So I had no place for just me and the groom to sit once we moved inside for dancing, so when I came back outside to sit at the sweetheart table maybe 20 minutes later, I found it had already been broken down and removed. a) who breaks down decor in the middle of a wedding?! b) why was it so hard to make sure that the bride has a place to sit at her own wedding? 7\. Nobody on staff communicates between departments. When I arrived to check into the hotel, holding my wedding dress, all excited for the weekend, the front desk staff had no idea I was getting married there, didn't even look up, and had be wait about 20 minutes while they helped other people, all of whom were offered champagne, while I was sitting there ignored holding my wedding dress like an idiot. On my wedding day, when my photographer checked in at the front desk, someone dropped her off at my room and then left, so I had no golf cart to use (as promised) and had to literally walk around on grass and gravel in my wedding heels for an hour taking photos with no help getting around the property. The event staff are all nice people, but clearly not communicating or don't have the support they need to execute the level of service promised. It sucks that I was disappointed on my wedding day and have to remember that forever.

We hosted an intimate wedding of 50 guests in the new Arbor followed by a wedding reception in the Hilltop Dining Room. We cannot sing the praises of Carneros more and the majority...

of this comes not only from the scenery and venue itself but also from the AMAZING on site coordinator, Elizabeth. Elizabeth is responsive, professional and flexible. She worked with us and made us feel so relaxed every step of the way. I had no pre-wedding jitters due to the fact I knew she was on her game. I plan events for a living and have NEVER worked with a more professional on site coordinator. In Napa and Sonoma, you will come across some very beautiful venues but we did our homework and Carneros Inn has it all- stunning scenery, beautiful amenities and incredible team members (Elizabeth and her team member Natalie who assisted day of). Also, a good on site coordinator can make or break your day. Elizabeth has been in Napa for a while and knew TONS of great vendors (as well as some horror stories). She was our inside woman since we live in SF and I only run events in SF, NY, LA and have minimal experience in wine country. Our stay at Carneros during the wedding and the days following: They bent over backwards and sent us lovely amenities during our stay! My husband and I joked that every time we left our suite, we would come back to more sparkling wine or other delicious treats. Oh yeah, they upgraded us to an INCREDIBLE suite and even let us add one more day to our stay. Everything was top notch!

My husband/then-fiance and I wanted a small private wedding for just our family. We found the Carneros Inn's elopement package to be the perfect fit. Elizabeth Harris, the wedding ...

coordinator, took care of everything so that all we had to do was show up and enjoy the day. Elizabeth and the Carneros Inn coordinated with local vendors to provide, flowers, music, a photographer, cocktails for the event and we couldn't have been happier. The venue was absolutely gorgeous. We all also stayed on the property together. Each of our family members had separate bungalow, which were absolutely lovely. Truly, it was absolutely perfect and we can't wait to go back.

My husband I got married early June 2016 at the Carneros Inn and it was an absolute dream! I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a gorgeous, stress-free Napa wedding. ...

Besides it's amazing space, we originally chose the Carneros Inn because we were looking for a Napa wedding where we could have amazing views of the valley, our band could play past 11pm and we were allowed to serve hard alcohol. (If you've just begun your venue search, you may not know this but wineries/vineyards are only allowed to serve beer and wine AND most venues in Napa/Sonoma require you to turn off you music at 10pm). Besides meeting all of our logistical "musts" it met all of our dream wedding "musts": Gorgeous grounds, an outside ceremony location with an amazing view, a separate area for cocktails and dinner (and even dancing if you wanted it). The Carneros blends a farm house/barn look with a classic elegant feel which is exactly what we were looking for. Overall, the best part about the Carneros Inn was the staff (especially the complimentary month of wedding planner, Elizabeth Harris). Over a year and a half of wedding planning I interacted with a lot of folks in the wedding industry and Elizabeth was by far the most competent, organized, professional, efficient, knowledgeable and altogether lovely one out there. She was always quick to follow-up on questions, thorough with her answers, understanding of restrictions and supportive throughout. For instance, a month before my wedding I received a call from my furniture vendor that all of my cocktail rentals were ruined at another wedding. Given I was getting married in June in Napa, there was no inventory left throughout the area, but Elizabeth helped me fix the situation in less than a week! On the day of there were a few minor disasters and Elizabeth was so good at her job that I did not know about one of them (until weeks later). She was amazing and blocking and tackling and making sure I was having the best day of my life. I owe her so much! You are in amazing hands if you go with Elizbaeth and the Carneros Inn. Only thing to consider whem booking is that rooms a quite pricey and they dont offer much in terms of rooms blocks so your guests will likely stay in Napa, Sonoma or Yountville (my guests stayed in Yountville because it has a cute town feel and they loved it)

the carneros inn the most breathtaking, lovely wedding venue. it was the first place we saw and we immediately fell in love when we saw it. the venue is full of gorgeous locations-...

-from the adorable apple orchard where many couples choose to have their ceremony, to the napa and sonoma ballrooms which make great use of indoor/outdoor space, to a lovely outdoor courtyard with overhanging string lights. the place comes with a hefty site fee but it is well worth it in my opinion! the service of the entire team there is also superb!
