sty, one of the wedding coordinators who works at the venue, and she was incredible. She never hesitated to get any questions we had answered in a timely manner and went out of her way to make sure our day went off without a hitch. She handled the major coordination of the whole day including between all the additional vendors we had. The food, prepared by the onsite chef was delicious! And the staff were so nice and professional throughout the night. We had an absolute blast the whole night and they never hesitated to make sure we got what we wanted out of the experience. Our guests could not stop talking about how beautiful the property was and we even had a guest appearance from a small group of deer during dinner. Truly a magical experience.

The Mountain Terrace was the first venue we toured, and we instantly fell in love with the redwoods. It has the most beautiful combination of towering trees, bay views, and a warm,...

intimate backyard feel that was perfect for us. There was a large grassy lawn for games, mingling, and enjoying nature. We enjoyed having dinner out on the deck and transitioning indoors for dancing after sunset. Like many of the other reviews have stated, the food was fantastic. We loved the variety of appetizers (that duck croustade was especially yummy!), and they made sure that we got a full platter at our sweetheart table to enjoy. We also loved that we could customize our own signature drinks to make the night even more personal, and the team was so accommodating in sourcing ingredients and collaborating with us on the recipe. Our coordinator, Kristy, was absolutely amazing. She would answer all of my questions through email nearly instantaneously and on the day of, kept the schedule and events running so smoothly. If there were any issues, I didn't know about it! If you're looking for a stunning venue with natural beauty, delicious food, and exceptional coordination, The Mountain Terrace is unbeatable!

The Mountain Terrace seems to specialize in making your life easy. We were teamed up with Caren from minute one, and she walked us through every step from the day we chose our date...

to the Big Day itself. She was always available, always quick to respond, always helpful and extremely organized and meticulous. The venue itself is beautiful, but also very down to earth, which was perfect for us. Open grass, surrounded by redwoods, and a warm and welcoming indoor space with a large wooden deck that could easily accommodate our community (and then some). The on-site staff was extremely caring and really did their utmost to make sure that everyone was getting everything they needed and enjoying themselves. They do have some strict limits on outdoor amplification, so be sure to check in accordance with your needs. They were very accommodating with us, and did their best to make it work. We had an amazing experience that we will always treasure!

Mountain Terrace and their team are an absolute dream! We hosted our wedding reception there and couldn't be happier. My husband and I were initially drawn to the breathtaking redw...

oods and view of the city. The space has such a unique balance of a grassy lawn for cocktail hour and mingling, a cozy deck that feels like someone's backyard, and an indoor space for dance. There's also a fire pit area that we utilized for s'mores and our guests loved it! It gets chilly at night, so heat lamps are a must, even in August! The food was incredible -- our guests and vendors are still complimenting us for our choices. The chef personally allowed us to adjust the menu and prepared pork lumpia as an hors d'oeuvre which our guests loved. The service team went above and beyond, Juan especially made sure we felt like guests at our own wedding and personally looked after us so we could enjoy all of the food we had carefully chosen. Caren was amazing throughout the planning process. She patiently answered all of our questions, helped us adjust when our guest count changed, and gave us the freedom to make the program our own. We loved being able to create his-and-her cocktails, bring our own ramen and s'mores for late night snacks. Anastasia was also extremely flexible, allowing us to drop off last-minute items without any stress. Our guests loved the unique atmosphere, the delicious food, and the exemplary service.

A hidden gem. My husband and I had our eyes set on having an outdoor redwood venue in the Bay Area. The Mountain Terrace was probably the 3rd venue we visited (overall, we ended u...

p visiting over 20), and each time we visited a different venue, we couldn’t stop thinking about the first impression TMT left on us. For starters - it is STUNNING. My favorite part was seeing everyone’s faces when they walked through the entrance. The vast open space, redwoods, and a glimpse of the skyline view was just the earthy-atmosphere we were looking for. The food - this was a deal breaker for us. Our wedding was in October and I STILL have people messaging me about how they crave the food/apps served at our wedding… and that it had been the best tasting wedding meal they’ve had thus far, which I truly stand by. TMT banquet staff delivered, served and left no crumbs!! 10/10 perfection. The staff - I could not give ENOUGH kudos to all the staff that had a handle in making our day so incredible. Shout-out to our banquet manager Juan - who went above and beyond in accommodating our guests with special requests. With the level of care they had, it truly felt like they treated each of us like family. And Caren & Kristy - for helping a bride feel SANE throughout the wedding planning process… The amount of emails I sent Caren were probably in the triple digits, but she always responded within the day and was so informative/insightful each time. She also helped me find a better option for these chairs that I absolutely NEEDED - and they truly tied our Star Wars themed wedding together so well!! Also an added plus - they have a suite/house around the corner that you can rent for your bridal party the night before/night of. This was a HUGE help to us as we were able to have our wedding party together for last minute DIYs and for get ready photos too. The home is newly renovated and was the perfect stay for the night of. Definitely recommended & 100% convenient!! IN SHORT: The catering was ELITE, the banquet staff & coordinators are professionals, and the venue views?!? 10/10. If you're looking for an aesthetic outdoor venue that combines outstanding service, SUPERB catering and a truly enchanting atmosphere, TMT is the place to be. We couldn't have imagined a more perfect place to say, I do.

The Mountain Terrace made my wedding day just PERFECT. When we were trying to choose a wedding venue, having these three criteria fulfilled was important: responsible staff, beaut...

iful space, and delicious food. The Mountain Terrace was just so perfect to fulfill these criteria. Staff: I had tons of small and big questions to ask via email. Caren, our communication point and wedding planner, always responded within 12 hours. Her answers were SO clear as well. It was a huge relief for me because I could plan my wedding with confidence promptly. She would also think ahead of me and save so much of my time. No words can describe how awesome she is!! The manager of the day was also so nice. He made sure that everything was on schedule and that we were feeling comfortable with what was happening. Every other staff we met was always ready to serve us and answer our questions with a smile🥹🥹 I wanted to say thank you to everyone who was working with us throughout my wedding prep and on the day of. The space: Many of our guests (almost 1/2 of them) were coming on the plane from different states and countries. Making sure they enjoyed every single view of the venue was crucial for us. And it was a success! So many of them (even our local guests) complimented how beautiful this venue was. The redwood trees just made my wedding day so magical. When I walked down the virgin road, I literally felt like I was walking into my dream that I had dreamt of since I was a little girl🥹🥹 The indoor space was so cute as well. I will never forget our first wedding dance on the floors surrounded by everyone. The food: It was truly THE BEST FOOD I'VE EVER HAD at any weddings I had ever been to!!!!!! Knowing our guests were coming from far places, we truly wanted to treat them well with good food. I also knew our guests were picky eaters and I am a big foodie. In my culture, there's a joke (but I consider it an adage), "Food is what's left in the wedding guests' hearts." TMT JUST NAILED IT. people just raved about the food all night!! My wedding was about two months ago, but I still hear people raving about the food. A lot of my guests told me that it was the best wedding they had ever been to. Looking back on my wedding day, I can't stop smiling. It was a blessing to have found TMT to remember my wedding day extra special. Thank you so much, TMT!!

ay! - shoutout to Anastasia!). The venue is gorgeous and does not need too many embellishments to give it that extra flare for a wedding day or other big party. It was very windy on the day of the event but the staff worked very hard to make sure our guests were comfortable. Everyone complimented on the professionalism and care of the entire staff. My clumsy party also broke so many glasses on the dance floor...but the bar manager and his staff were on top of everything, cleaning up the messes and ensuring everything was safe so quickly that it was like it had never happened! The best part of an event here is the food for sure. The in-house catering is so delicious. I wish it was a regular restaurant I could go back to over and over but on the other hand it's extra special that its for special events here only. Their pricing is also transparent unlike some other venues. We knew at all stages how much we were spending and how much extra add-ons would be. We highly recommend them.

We got married at Mountain Terrace in March. From start to finish, working with Mountain Terrace was a smooth experience. Caren and the team are very easy to work with, respond qui...

ckly to questions, and are knowledgeable and responsible. We loved the setting of the venue. The views are excellent, the redwood trees are atmospheric, and the covered patio and indoor space have a fancy rustic charm which was perfect for our wedding. Mountain Terrace has excellent food in house, and we appreciated not having to think about rentals, hiring staff, and catering/alcohol. The packages they offered fit our vision for our wedding well. The weather was not good on our wedding day, and the venue was really cozy in inclement weather and the team did everything they could to make the day run smoothly, despite the unexpected rain. Overall, we would strongly recommend getting married at Mountain Terrace and were thrilled with our wedding.

. I love the redwood trees and how natural the place feels, with the deck overlooking the view as well. As all other reviews note, the food was bomb and got so many compliments from our guests. The entire staff was so kind, the bartenders were great. Honestly no complaints, across the board we had zero regrets choosing TMT for our big day! We also rented the house next door the night before and after the wedding, which was a perfect place for us and the wedding party to get ready, and for some family to stay up there overnight and avoid late-night drives down the mountain. Extra shout-out to our coordinator Anastasia as well! She was super useful ahead of the big day, providing tons of resources for our planning and responding to all questions extremely promptly. For the day itself she was a godsend, she did a perfect job setting up the decorations, then had everything running so smoothly through the wedding. It left me and my groom able to just relax and enjoy our wedding.

s raved about it. Best of all, the staff did a phenomenal job in helping the day run smoothly. They were professional and demonstrated outstanding hospitality. Caren was our point of contact who helped us during the planning process. It was very easy communicating with her and she was always quick to respond. One annoying thing is that there is a no amplified music allowed outdoors due to city or county regulations. We had to hire live musicians for the ceremony and cocktail hour, which turned out very nice, but for those that might not have the budget, this is something to consider. It also made it harder to decide when to do the grand entrance and first dance, since we needed to those indoors but dinner would be outdoors. We ended up moving everyone indoors after cocktail hour for the grand entrance and first dance, and then back outdoors for dinner after. It can also get pretty chilly at night, even in the middle of summer. We opted not to get the heaters, and we regret that decision a little bit. Overall we had a great experience with the Mountain Terrace and would highly recommend them.

your wedding. We take pride in our delicious catering and top notch staff and it’s great to hear that you and your guests enjoyed your celebration so much! We wish we could allow amplified music outside, but the Town of Woodside prohibits us at present. We are working with them to potentially change this in the future but recommend that our couples do as you did and have acoustic musicians for their ceremony and cocktail hour, which creates a lovely ambiance outside. Although you decided to move indoors for the Grand Entrance before dinner, we often have them outdoors without music or inside after dinner before the First Dance. Most couples choose to have the first dance inside after dinner with their DJ as well, then open up the dance floor for their guests at that time. We are experienced at suggesting options to best utilize the DJ and avoid having amplified music outdoors while keeping to each couple’s vision. We hope that our team was able to support you in creating your ideal atmosphere and flow. Thank you again for choosing to celebrate with us!

After having visited and talking with the staff and owners, it became apparent that they have strong communication skills and provide excellent customer service. Having their own in-house catering proved to be very convenient and we were completely satisfied with the quality of their food in the end. We worked with Anastasia as our coordinator and she was truly fantastic in both helping us prepare for the event and making sure everything ran smoothly the day of. The Mountain Terrace was attentive to our requests and worked with us on our customization needs. The staff were genuinely warm and friendly that helped to put the guests at ease. I have so much appreciation for their clear communication, transparent pricing, excellent vendor relationships, and customer-forward business model. It was a tough call for us to make at the time in choosing the right venue, but in hindsight, we absolutely made the correct choice. I can't endorse the Mountain Terrace enough and I would highly recommend you visit and talk with them to see if they will also be the right venue for you.

woods on the grounds, cozy cabin-like interior, and large two-tiered deck with clear plastic coverings. The food and drink options provided by the venue were delicious: we chose the duck, salmon, and hen of the woods entrees. The day of our wedding was unfortunately cold, windy, and rainy, and we had very much hoped to have an outdoor wedding on the grounds. The staff at the venue had all the seating set up outside, and they were very calm and flexible, giving us until literally 20 minutes before the ceremony started to audible to an indoor ceremony as our musicians could not play in the wet conditions. They quickly re-organized all the chairs on the deck, and we proceeded with a cozy indoor ceremony. Anastasia, our coordinator, was so incredibly helpful, organized, and supportive through the entire process. She responded very quickly to all our emails throughout the planning process, keeping us on track with the timeline, reminding us of anything we had missed, and being warm and flexible with any changes we wanted to make. She even helped me bustle the complex ties on my dress. We had a great experience at The Mountain Terrace with Anastasia on our team, and would absolutely recommend the to anyone else looking for an event venue!

Also, there is not a large space for getting ready in for the wedding party.

I highly recommend booking the Terrace Suite for the night before and the night of as well as it provides a place for the bridal party to get ready and a place to retreat to after the reception. I would also recommend getting heat lamps no matter what time of year it is, it gets pretty chilly at night.

lified music outside, which means if you want music during the ceremony and cocktail hour, you need to hire string musicians. There is not really a spot for the bride and bridesmaids to get ready the day of (the get ready room is not designed for the girls to get their hair and makeup done at the venue), so you will almost assuredly need to rent the house next to the venue for 2 nights to make sure the bridal party has a place to get ready the day of. There are lots of little charges that add up. That may be standard for the industry and venues in general, we just were not aware of that when we selected the venue, so it ended up being more expensive than we had initially thought. Uber/Lyft does not reliably pick up from there, so you will likely need to order transportation for your guests, if you want them to be able to drink without driving. Again, we really liked the venue, and we felt that we had a magical wedding day. There were just a few things we were not expecting and they caught us off guard.

feedback we could wish for as we take pride in our gorgeous redwood trees and delicious food. Our goal is for each couple to feel special and fully enjoy their day and it sounds like overall we met our mark. The Terrace Suite house next door is a lovely and convenient option for a bride, groom and wedding party to prepare for the wedding day without additional travel from a hotel. We hope you enjoyed your stay with us! There are so many details involved with planning a wedding and it can be cumbersome to track the various details of each venue, particularly during the venue selection process. We aim to be transparent in outlining costs and coverage during the sales process to minimize any surprises, including providing a personalized proposal to each couple reflecting the estimated costs for their event based on their selections for guest count, food, beverages and additional rentals before booking . Changing packages or selections during the planning process can affect those costs. I’m sorry to hear that there were small costs that were surprising to you (as your final invoice was almost identical to your original estimate when you booked). We appreciate the feedback and will continue to review our systems as we never want any of our clients to feel caught off guard. Warm regards, Caren

We were slightly disappointed by their lack of vegetarian fare that didn't highlight mushrooms. They also listed some items as vegetarian that were not actually (i.e. sardines in Caesar salad dressing). They do charge for extras that we anticipated would be already included in the total cost (i.e dance floor, heated lamps, cheese cutting, s'mores, flower clean-up, etc) so I recommend asking ahead about these. Caren our coordinator was very responsive and always willing to chat with us to help curate our vision.

It is so great to hear that you had a wonderful experience overall and that your guests enjoyed the food and setting on your wedding day. I hope you were able to at least enjoy your boxed meals after your celebration. I’m sorry to hear that you found our menu to be lacking in vegetarian options. We do have a large vegetarian section on the menu and are open to customization. I know that you were pretty set on the pierogi from the outset and I’m sorry that I was not aware that you were interested in an alternative option. We have also subsequently reviewed the coding on our entire Classic menu to ensure accuracy for vegetarian, vegan, dairy free and gluten free notations. I realize there was some confusion with the Caesar salad at your tasting, but we have hopefully remedied any future issues. We typically review “extras” during the sales and planning process, including pricing for heat lamps, rose petal clean up, umbrellas, rented dance floor (if not dancing in the bar), etc. and build those into your customized cost estimate as appropriate. But I understand that wedding planning can be a little overwhelming, particularly in the preliminary stages, and perhaps those options didn’t stick with you initially. This is good feedback and our sales team will work on clearly defining options and extras in their initial proposals. Your cheese wheel cake cutting was a fun idea and a nice personal touch that your guests enjoyed. We worked together to find a creative service plan avoiding any additional fees. Overall, we are super appreciative that you chose to host your celebration at The Mountain Terrace and that the “slight hiccups” wouldn’t have changed your experience. Warm regards, Caren

Update! The MOST beautiful venue with the most delicious food, fantastic drinks, helpful and kind staff. All around, the best decision we made for our wedding! Everyone was telling...

us how gorgeous the venue was, how delicious the food was, and how perfect the space was for us. We loved that it was convenient and easy to get to for our guests, but we felt like we were tucked away in a magical woods with a gorgeous view of the bay. The food and drinks were fantastic and were were so lucky that they packaged up leftovers for us to enjoy the following days! The staff were just the best -- helpful throughout the entire process, kind and thoughtful during the day, and the entire day ran so smoothly. Kristy (our coordinator through the venue) was perfect -- easy to communicate with, incredibly knowledgeable, kind, and flexible with all of our asks! She and the Mountain Terrace made our day perfect. We are so grateful to have gotten married in such a beautiful place. \------ Katia and the whole team at the Mountain Terrace have been phenomenal!!! From our first meeting to go over the package, to the site tour, to our numerous questions over email and adjustments to the estimate/contract - they have been so kind, helpful, and patient! We are very excited to have our wedding here :)

balance of indoor/outdoor, we are both nature and redwood tree lovers and wanted a natural landscape that would also be comfortable for our guests. They were very responsive, after our initial inquiry, they set up a zoom meeting and reviewed a lot of the basics - I found this very helpful as the entire wedding planning process can feel daunting. She was ready to talk specifics, asking about wedding date thoughts and average guest count, it helped us get the ball rolling on the details needed to plan a wedding. After the zoom we set up a tour, they provide a lot of information, which helped us compare cost and ultimately choose our venue. They also offer a wedding coordinator who will be involved 4 months prior to the wedding + wedding day to help with everything. This was a big draw for me. I'm very happy to have officially booked this stunning venue and look forward to next months planning the bid day!

to last call absolutely flawless. The gorgeous backdrop of the redwoods is the perfect setting that complimented our decor. Our guests raved about the service of the bartenders, the incredible display of appetizers, the plating and quality of our seated dinner, and the picture perfect atmosphere that the Mountain Terrace Provides. Every single aspect of our reception was perfection, and that is a huge credit to the Mountain Terrace and their incredible service. Choosing a venue for a wedding is likely the hardest part, but once you come to the Mountain Terrace, there just truly is no other option. I would recommend this venue to any bride, not only for its beauty, but with the knowledge that you and your guests will have the most incredible experience.

We curated a custom menu with the chef and the food was absolutely amazing! We worked with Brooke to coordinate all of our details and she was so great. She kept us on top of all the planning and accommodated all of our request. She was our day of coordinator and I'm so glad we had her there! She stayed on top of our schedule, I didn't even know what time it was half of the time. Highly recommend, such a beautiful, professional space.

g. All of my guests complimented the wedding so much. I want to say most of it was about how beautiful this place is and/or how delicious the food was. The food was to die for! I was so disappointed when I couldn't have any of the appetizers during cocktail hour, so the employees grabbed some for me during dinner! The staff is so amazing. The only downfall of this place is their wedding coordinator. It was so hard to talk to her, to get messages across. I told her to talk to my wedding planner about everything and it literally took me telling her three times before she got the message. If you're not prepared to do things their way, be prepared for a difficult planning experience.

your expectations. Our records show that wedding day-of coordination was not purchased through the Mountain Terrace. Our couple's experience is EXTREMELY important to us and we have thoroughly discussed your feedback as a team. As a venue, we try our best to be transparent throughout the sales and planning processes. Our onsite planners are happy to work with outside wedding planners, and we strive to make sure all parties involved are thoroughly informed. We will always include the couple on any and all important email conversations and financial reminders, while cc'ing the planner, to ensure their expectations are met for their special day. We are so happy we were able to make your day of experience so fabulous and will definitely take your feedback with us as we strive to grow and improve.

's absolutely beautiful. My husband and I are both very laid back, and Caren from TMT emailed us every few months, reminding us of details she needed to know, which turned out to be so helpful in keeping us on track. Without her, we would have been pretty disorganized. The day of, all the staff went above and beyond to make our day special. They brought champagne to the bridal suite, made up a plate of hors d'oeuvres for my husband and I while we were busy taking photos, arranged our cake with our bouquets as decoration on the dessert table, and the bartender even learned some guests' favorite drinks. It was clear this venue hosts lots of events and really knows what they are doing. If you are looking for a beautiful outdoors venue with lots of classy details, and amazing customer service, this is it!

The attentive service and gorgeous setting at The Mountain Terrace made our day. The venue is beautiful - you're getting married on a grassy lawn surrounded by redwoods overlook...

ing the south bay. The sunset views are spectacular. A deer came at dusk to graze at the edge of the lawn. The lights over the deck and fire pit made for a romantic setting once the sun set. I added on the day-of planning services and highly recommend it because I got to enjoy my wedding and not worry about where I needed to be or who was taking care of our guests. Caren made the day seamless, calm, and fun! She brought us a personal plate of appetizers and champagne during post-ceremony portraits. The bride's dressing room had water (with straws to preserve lipstick!) chairs and a big mirror. Our guests were very well taken care of. We got comments about how accommodating they were of dietary restrictions and how delicious dinner and appetizers were. Our wedding was on August 5, so it was sunny and warm on the lawn during the ceremony, but definitely cooler than in Palo Alto. We looked at weather forecasts for La Honda to prepare. It cooled off to a very comfortable temperature for dinner. We didn't need the heat lamps but were glad to have them because you never know how much it will cool off once the sun sets. There is air conditioning inside, which was great when we were dancing. Caren was very responsive and helpful giving recommendations on heat lamps and umbrellas as we approached our big day. She quickly answered every email in the days and months leading up to our wedding. Overall it was a spectacular experience and we highly recommend The Mountain Terrace and Caren!

Have your wedding here! My husband and I just got married in October 2017, and it was truly the perfect place for us. It incorporates a "laid back" vibe being amongst the redwoods,...

with a rustic bar, great dance floor area, and the outdoor seating with twinkle lights. Caren (one of the wedding coordinators) is amazing and very responsive. She's on top of things- you don't have to worry about a thing with her! The staff is also very friendly and attentive. We couldn't have asked for anything better. It fit us perfectly and the experience was everything we imagined and more. Just a "big backyard" wedding! All of our guests loved it too! Biggest downside is the drive up to the mountain terrace, so highly recommend shuttles if you're having alcohol. Last, the food is great, reasonably priced, and the bar/drink service that's included is awesome as well!

the venue until after the wedding itself. We had our wedding coordinator drop off our final payment the day before our wedding and a few weeks later were told they lost the cashiers check. Since we already moved out of the state, this was upsetting news. A few days later we were then told they forgot to calculate our initial deposit into the final bill. Needless to say it took us several days and an incredible amount of stress to sort this out. Mountain Terrace sent us a gift card and apology letter, but it didn't make up for the fact that someone lost a check, and then couldn't do math. Wedding itself was great, the people who handle your money...not so much.

oment we toured the venue, we knew we were going to be choosing it for our wedding. Charisse was the best guide to the beginning stages of booking a wedding venue. She explained everything, walked us through every step, and worked with us on every detail of the contract. A true professional! And I have to give a special shout out to Caren. She was a dream to work with. She answered emails quickly and never had to explain anything twice. Even up to the day before the wedding, she was working with us to make sure there was no stone unturned and no detail missed. Sharon, the day of event manager, was the BEST. She and the staff the day of worked tirelessly to make sure everything ran smoothly. Cocktail hour and dinner were great, by the way! We felt so taken care of. They made sure we didn't miss a thing while we socialized without guests. If anyone is interested in using the Mountain Terrace, don't hesitate! Book it! The drive to and from the venue is worth it! Our guests are still talking about how gorgeous everything was a month later.
