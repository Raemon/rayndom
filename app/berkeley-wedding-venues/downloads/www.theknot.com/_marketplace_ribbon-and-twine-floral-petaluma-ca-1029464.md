Ribbon and twine was my favorite wedding vendor by far! The owner is such an angel and truly has a gift for wild, balanced, and stunning creations. I loved that she listened to me,...

understood my vision, and iterated on in a way that made my dreams come true! She is flexible and willing to work work you on prices. I was frustrated with other floral quotes because they didn’t seem to care about the blooms or styles, all they asked about was color. She understands that flowers are far more than a pallets. Highly recommend booking them for your wedding. Got so many complemented from our guests!

understanding of our desire to meet a particular budget, and she proposed design alternatives in order to meet our budget while still achieving our overall ideal look. On our wedding day, she slipped in to our bridal suite leaving our bouquets, the flower girl crown, mother corsage-bracelets (a creative new twist on the traditional corsage!), and my Dog of Honor's flower collar. Each piece was stunning. The groom's and groomsmen's boutonnieres were also gorgeous. I could not have loved my bridal bouquet more. Our ceremony centerpieces were exactly what I was hoping for - classic lanterns with candles inside surrounded by gorgeous flowers and greens. She captured our colors and style perfectly. Our ceremony flowers were also exactly what I wanted. We could not be more pleased with her and her company and the flower masterpieces that she provided that will forever be captured in our wedding photos! She was also very easy to contact and pay via Venmo throughout the wedding planning process.
