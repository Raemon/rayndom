Georgette and her team saved my wedding dress! I ordered my dream wedding dress from a different store that ordered my dress two sizes too small and then ruined it with an extreme...

ly poor tailoring job. Three months before my wedding, my mom reached out to Georgette for advice and Georgette became my absolute angel! She went above and beyond to help me navigate the difficult situation with my credit card after the original store refused to refund my money. Given Georgette’s experiences and expertise with the Elysee/Enzoani dress designer, she was able to expedite an order for my original dream dress in the correct size, began alterations within a week, and then worked with my busy schedule over subsequent appointments to make sure the dress fit perfectly in all the right places. They even tailored my veil so it matched perfectly with my dress. Everything was pressed and beautiful for the day of my wedding. Their tailor Marie is professional, patient, and very meticulous. Their work is such high quality, all-inclusive, and well worth the price! My dress fit perfectly, and I felt so beautiful and so comfortable! Without the Papers and Petals bridal team, I would not have been able to wear my dream wedding dress and feel as beautiful as I did. I would recommend them to anyone looking for someone they can trust to help navigate the confusing and expensive wedding dress industry.

She is attentive, thoughtful, and has such a calming presence, You can tell she cares deeply about every bride who walks through the door. Her family is just as lovely, and together they create an atmosphere that feels welcoming and supportive. I'm so grateful for my experience at Papers and Pedals Bridal.

Melinda really listened to my concerns and things I was looking for in a dress. She was also very helpful in telling us what could be altered and reassuring any doubts or hesitations I had. I'm so happy I said yes to my dress here! (Even more excited that I picked a Randy dress!!!) The store itself is very clean, elegant, and refreshing. I wish I had come here in the first place!

She also checked in on me multiple times throughout the process with encouraging messages and thoughts. She had an amazing number of dresses to select from and a fantastic seamstress to make any alternations or modifications. I would highly recommend Paper and Petals to any and every future bride!

My experience with the staff at Papers and Petals and specifically Georgette was nothing short of that Fairy Godmother experience from Cinderella. This shop was my 4th shop on my ...

journey to find "The One". My first few bridal shop experiences being very disappointing, and I was mentally preparing to make compromises as it seamed what I was looking for did not exist. First, I was having trouble finding sample sizes in my size (bridal 20, street 16). Other shops just don't carry "plus size" sample dresses. I called the store to set my appointment and Georgette reassured me that they have dresses for evey beautiful body! We arrive and I tell her my laundry list of 'wants'. (Drop waist, large lace design, bling detail, high illusion neck, sleeveless, with a killer train) The first one she pulled for me was a strapless sweetheart dress and I let out a mental sigh... right out the gate this didn't hit the 'high neck' look I was going for. She showed me that the dress came with this small cape for church weddings... I was un-impresed. Then she explained. She could make me any type of dress I wanted. I didn't have to compromise. She could use the cape fabric and build me the high neck dress of my dreams. The dress itself was a Justin Alexander drop waist, nude over ivory. I felt beautiful and comfortable. The lace was perfect and the train was To. Die. For. I tried on others but I didn't get that same feeling. I left that day with tears in my eyes and ordered that first dress and a beautiful cathedral length veil. 7 months later the dress arrives. I get a phone call and schedule my first alterations appointment (first picture). The length needed to be shortened and it needed to be taken in. Still nervous but I trusted Georgette. Overall it took 3 alterations appointments (really only two, I came in for a third appt. to make sure sizing was just right). I got so many compliments my guests coming up to me and genuinely saying my dress was beautiful and I looked amazing! My (now) husband was blown away! There was nothing about my dress I would change. Nothing. It was perfect. Thank you Georgette for making me feel beautiful and comfortable. Thank you for designing my dream dress. Thank you for being my Fairy Godmother!

king for, it was evident that the dress I had found was NOT “the one.” Georgette has an amazing eye for style and personality, and the first dress she put on me was the perfect dress and the one I ultimately purchased. All the fittings also were extremely smooth – the staff was very professional and talented, and they were able to make the small alterations I wanted to the dress. The whole team always had my best interest at heart and was always honest and helpful with us. From a personnel standpoint, I feel that Papers and Petals cannot be beat. Georgette has hired a lovely group that is friendly, kind, supportive, and just fun to be around. All of my bridesmaids, my mom, and myself all had so much fun every time we went to the shop and always walked out laughing. Georgette and her team felt like family and we were so grateful for their support and friendship throughout the process. I am so grateful that we found them and would recommend them to every bride! Their service and the quality of their dresses cannot be beat.

ing for my dress to arrive MUCH later than it was promised, I was told that I needed to come to the boutique for a fitting. The shop refused to allow me to schedule a fitting for the weekend, which was frustrating. I scheduled an appointment and sat in more than an hour of traffic from San Francisco, then arrived at the shop. I was rudely greeted, and left alone in the shop for several minutes while they went to find my dress (since I had an appointment, I would expect them to maybe have my dress ready to go?). I tried on my dress that was about 6" too long. As this was a fitting, I thought she might help me pin my dress or give me feedback. Instead, I was told "the dress looks like it fits ok. You should take it somewhere to get hemmed." I don't know why I had to bother to drive to this store on a weekday to be treated poorly and pushed out the door. Clearly, this shop cares about making a sale. Once they have your money, you are worthless to them. Implorable customer experience, and every member of the bridal party had similar or WORSE experiences.

Response from Papers and Petals Bridal on 09/28/2016

Dear Krissy, My name is Carolyn I manage the social media for Papers and Petals Bridal. I...

was very surprised to see the reviews you posted; and wanted to clarify a few points after carefully reviewing your file. 1\. The bridesmaid dresses were ordered on May 2, 2016 the dresses arrived in our store early part of July (they arrived early within 2 months, the typical time frame for BM dresses is 3.5 months) 2\. You picked up your dress on Aug 4, two months prior to the wedding; therefore you had ample time to pick up your dress without rushing. 3\. Your dress was ready when you arrived, we simply needed a few minutes to retrieve it. 4\. As far as the length, the bride ordered extra long because your tall, and at that time she was planning on the BM wearing heels, which is an appropriate decision. 5\. You were given the option of P&P doing the hem for you or, you could take the dress with you and have it hemmed elsewhere, for your convenience, as opposed to driving back down to Burlingame to pick it up. This option is available to all our customers. 6\. The only reason we weren’t able to take you in that weekend; is we we’re booked all weekend, which is normal for a bridal shop. Our shop does cares about our customers and the services we provide; I hope the above response not only clarified how the bridesmaid process operates; but also to let you know; it is never our intention to make someone feel they are being treated poorly. Sincerely, Carolyn

ect wedding dress. The assistant (I forgot her name but I remember she just got engaged and it was her first day back when I went there) was so helpful. I believe I tried 8 dresses. She was good with suggesting the gowns that I really had in mind. I wanted a princess still poofy gown, lace and covers the chest area. She found it at the last minute because she thought that they dont have it in store. My gown is a Justin Alexander 8726 in Ivory and Im so in love with it. The first time I tried it, I dont want to remove it anymore. The gown was expensive but it was really what I wanted so I bought it. The veil was also expensive but it has the lace that matches my gown so I bought it. I paid another extra for the veil because apparently it doesnt come with the "front part" so they have to put it in. The alteration WAS REALLY expensive. The first trial after the alteration which was 1 week before the wedding didnt go well so they have to keep it and I have to pick it up 3 days before the wedding. Good thing I have a bridal shower on the area so I was able to go. I leave 1 hour away. But all in all I love my gown, I love the service and they are all so nice. if you want to go to this shop. you should be willing to shell out a huge amount of money but it will be worth it. All there gowns are amazing.

e friendly and welcoming! She nailed the style of dress my sister wanted and was extremely kind about my nephew running around the store. She and her son, Bill, did the alterations on my wedding dress, and took extensive time to make sure every layer was hemmed to perfection. When we brought my mother in to find her mother of the bride dress, the staff was sweet and attentive. They found my mom the PERFECT dress and made her feel beautiful. The salon has a family-friendly attitude and is willing to work with you to make your wedding style come together. Don't be afraid to ask questions! Knowing costs up front helps you makes the best decisions for your budget, and the salon can be better prepared to help you work within that budget. I am grateful for Georgette's help and I'm so glad we found Papers and Petals.

After having no luck dress shopping all day, we decided to call Papers and Petals on a whim to see if we could come check out their stock on a Saturday. Most people know, wedding ...

dress shops on weekends are a mad house. They were more than happy to have us come by without an appointment! While they were busy, they were able to get me a room and have me try on dresses without making me feel like a "number" or rushed at all. I eventually found my dress, and after coming back to the store 3 times to try it on just to be sure I was able to put down a credit card and seal the deal. The only thing that made me give them a 4 star instead of 5 stars was they didn't tell me that I was considered a "plus size" and later charged my credit card an additional $200+ without telling me. When I called to ask what the charge was for, I was told "don't worry I'll take care of you" but I never knew how. While that set me off a little, I didn't want it to ruin the feelings I had for my dress. When it came in I received a call to set up my alterations. When I arrived to my appointment, she had it all set up for me in a dressing room - no waiting around! The alterations took 1 week. While I didn't comparison shop for prices, this place gave me the dress I wanted for a decent price.

The shop that I found my dress at was great. It was small but had lots to choose from. I even found my bridesmaids dresses there as well! The whole process of choosing a dress was ...

fun and stress free. I added a heart on my dress from a tie of my dads and they put that on for me free of charge!

I actually found the dress I decided on for my wedding (but bought it second hand somewhere else because I couldn't afford the full price). That said, they had a great selection, t...

heir stock was in really good shape, I had not one, but two, dedicated shop helpers, and overall was just very happy with my experience! The second time I went was to see if they would be open to altering my dress even though I bought it somewhere else. (I did this because they seemed so comfortable with what was possible and I had bad luck somewhere else.) I met with the owner, and she was so sweet and truly cared. She REALLY HELPED me by being willing to have the dress altered through her, and then by even bringing her price down to help us out! I'm astounded! When I got the dress back the seamstress went out of her way again to make some tiny bead adjustments, and they do the BEST bustle! My dress was super heavy and nothing broke. Also, they color coordinated the bustle so it would be easy to match up when it came time to bustle the dress after the ceremony. I loved this place!

Great Selection. More Bridesmaid dresses than I have seen anywhere. Got my girls dresses here. Long shipping time (I am sure that this was the producers fault though). Very hap...

py with the bridesmaid dresses. Only my Jr. Bridesmaid had issues. She was told that they were ordering her a kids 14 and they sent a women's 4!!! It was a lot of trips to the seamstress to make that work. Got my wedding dress altered and cleaned here as well. VERY PRICEY. Paid almost $900 for cleaning and alterations! Could not believe they charged that much. But it turned out perfect. Fit like a glove and no complaints about the quality of the work.

I got all of my bridesmaids dresses and my dress altered from here. They are very helpful and nice, but the seamstress they use to do all of the work although good, takes 5 times ...

to get something right when you told her the first time to do it. Very frustrating. Other then that good experience.

At first the owner and the rest of the staff was very helpful and gave great attention. There was a decent selection of dresses at a variety of price ranges.;Once the dresses were ...

purchased, the staff was less than helpful. They were difficult to reach and when my dress came in 3 sizes to big they took no responsibility for helping to fix it. They also charged the remainder of my bridesmaids dresses to their credit cards without approval or even notifying them they were doing it and again, took zero responsibility and didn't even apologize when they called to complain about it - one of my bridesmaids had wanted to pay the balance in cash and had not tranferred enough money into her accout to handle it on her debit card - she just got lucky the charge was even accepted.

They were able to offer me a great deal on my gown.;The customer service is the flat out worst. I never got my calls returned, I was put on hold for 15 minute chunks, they never kn...

ew where my gown was or what the status was, they did not update me when they learned the gown would be late, and they claimed to repeatedly send me swatches when i never got most of them. I ordered a lace swatch of my gown FIVE TIMES over 5 months before it came, and when it did it was un-useably small.
