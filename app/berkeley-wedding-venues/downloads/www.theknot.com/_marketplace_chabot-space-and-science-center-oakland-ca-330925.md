I absolutely love this beautiful Oakland museum and observatory and would be thrilled to help you plan a special day in the stars. I've worked with weddings as a caterer since my very first job in high school, moved on to event planning post-college, and I've even been a bridesmaid 9 times! My favorite thing about Chabot is that the cost of your wedding supports all the educational programming we do for our community. It feels great to help couples realize their wedding dreams while also making a difference for local children every day.

We were so delighted to customize our Planetarium ceremony to display a nebula, the moon, the earth, colliding galaxies, and the night sky where we first met. Guests, especially kids and parents, had an absolute blast seeing exhibits, observing the telescopes, and partying in such a cool spot with so much expansive, exploratory energy.

c backdrop for the ceremony as well as the reception. For our wedding, we booked the Astronomy Hall and Observatory Deck. What we truly liked about Astronomy Hall was that it was a perfect blank canvas for us to decorate and fill. The high ceilings added to the grandeur and the space fit our guest count perfectly. Working with the Chabot Team was fantastic as well, they provided onsite support during our event and worked closely with our coordinator and caterer which made the event go smoothly. Many of our guests enjoyed the night and mentioned how unique a venue Chabot Space and Science Center was and we’re very happy we decided to go with such an amazing venue.

Chabot was the first venue we visited, and while we toured several others later on, we ultimately came back to the idea of getting married in a planetarium as the most unique and s...

pecial way to have our wedding. In retrospect, we're very glad we did! The museum is beautiful and varied as a ceremony and reception venue, and since my wife and I both work in entertainment, we were excited about the opportunity to customize the lighting, sound, and video content for our planetarium ceremony. The complimentary, volunteer-run telescope viewing outside of our reception was also a great bonus. I want to give a special shout out to Alex, the event manager and planetarium operator, who allowed us to create custom video content for the planetarium dome and did a great job answering all my technical questions about the content creation process and setting up our lighting cues to make sure the ceremony was everything we had imagined. Many guests told us that it was the most cinematic wedding they had ever been to! We're very happy that we had our wedding at Chabot and wouldn't hesitate to recommend the venue to other couples!

If we can give this place 10 stars we would. The Chabot staff were so friendly showing us the venue, and were very transparent about their process and costs. Plus, since the center...

is a non-profit, all of the costs goes towards funding science! One of the great things about the venue is that there isn't an increased surcharge for Spring or Summer weddings, nor for holidays. Saturdays are slightly more expensive, but we were able to have a summer wedding on a Sunday of a 3 day holiday weekend without all the extra costs. We opted for the Across the Universe package, which includes 2 hours of the Planetarium for the ceremony, and their Spees 1 and Spees 2 building. We worked with Alex for our ceremony and on the day of our wedding. She walked us through all the details to make the ceremony the most magnificent and incredible experience for us and our guests. She made sure we got all the lighting down, the timing right, and the music down to make sure all the tears flowed and smiles broke at the right time. Our guests even got a cool light show at the end of it! We were a little worried about set up since it's not a typical venue, but we worked with Rasheda and Alex who reassured us that everything would be perfect. They ran through all the little details of where guests could sit, what set up should look like, and took our concerns to heart. The venue itself is incredible. We didn't set out to have a child-friendly wedding but if you're looking for a venue that's great for kids, this is it! It's literally a science museum for kids and they can run around and look through the exhibits. Their parents loved it too! Our guests remarked on how cool it was to eat dinner in front of a giant rocket, and it really set the mood. I love this venue and its staff. I wish I could have another wedding here again!

Words can express how wonderful it was to have our wedding at Chabot! My husband and I were looking for a venue that was different than your traditional wedding location and Chabot...

was the perfect place. We booked the “Across the Universe” package which allowed us to have the ceremony in the Planetarium, cocktail hour upstairs & the reception in Astronomy Hall, 3 different places! We were in love with the idea that our guests could enjoy different settings all in the same location. The ability to customize the Planetarium in terms of lights, music & projections allowed us to really personalize the space. We got married October 7, 2023 and Chabot was able to project the sky from October 7, 2016, the day that we met which was super special! We had 150 guests and Astronomy Hall had the perfect amount of space where everyone had enough room to be comfortable to sit down but also move around and dance. We decided to go with their recommended vendors for wedding coordination (Simply Elegant by Diana), catering (Blue Heron), and lighting/DJ services (Verducci Event Productions) which really made the coordination process so easy! The Chabot team, Alex and Chelsea, are very organized and great to work with. They did an amazing job bringing our vision for the wedding to life and we are truly grateful for them! And because they are a non-profit, the rental cost of the venue goes back to fund the center, it was a no brainer for us to choose Chabot! If you’re looking for a unique and fun wedding venue, you will not regret picking the Chabot Space & Science Center!

guests loved being able to wander the exhibits and socialize, experience the Planetarium, dance around a rocket, and enjoy the general ambiance and magic (feedback is that it was the coolest wedding they had ever been to). The team, Rasheda, Chelsea, and Alex, were wonderful to work with. They were super communicative and organized, helped us stay on task, and were always available for questions from us and our wedding planner. The bonus is that the cost of the venue goes back into the STEM program for kids! If we had to do it all over again, we would 100% choose Chabot.

hoose Chabot as our venue, and we are so glad we did. Everyone at our wedding had a blast. We had so much fun, but so did our guests, and I’ve never seen kids enjoy a wedding so much. Afterwards we heard from our guests that it was the happiests/funnest/most unique wedding they’d ever been to. It was such a joy. We chose the Across the Universe package, which was so unique: getting married in the planetarium (thanks to Nicole for helping us with the planetarium A/V!), cocktail hour among the museum exhibits, and dinner and dancing in the Astronomy Hall. Our guests all loved the public telescope viewing, too. In addition to how cool the space itself is, the museum staff were great to work with. Samantha and Nicole were both friendly, and they were so helpful as we navigated changing COVID safety requirements on top of all of the usual wedding challenges. They were very communicative and worked well with all of our other vendors. We had a perfect wedding day, and a big part of that was working with such a rad venue.

ocktail hour was in the museum (second floor of Spees) and our reception was in Astronomy Hall. Since Chabot is in the middle of a redwood forest, there are lots of great places for photos. Chabot looks so cool that you don’t need many decorations. And the public telescope viewings on Saturday night provide an awesome activity for wedding guests who don’t like to dance. Our guests thought the venue was awesome. Perhaps the best thing about Chabot, however, is how helpful the staff is. Samantha Stevick, the Associate Director of Events, was particularly amazing. She was on top of everything and gave us so much helpful advice and good vendor recommendations. If she wanted to start a side business as a wedding planner, she absolutely could do it. It’s also great that you can pick your own caterer so you’re not stuck with some venue’s boring food. There were enough great options on Chabot’s preferred caterer list that we went with one of them, but we could have paid a bit extra to have any caterer we wanted. We were strongly encouraged by Chabot to choose a preferred caterer as the caterer has to do all of the set up of tables, chairs, etc. (for ceremony and for reception) in addition to food. The caterer can only do setup starting at 5pm when the museum closes, which does not give them much time (our ceremony started at 6pm), so it helps to have a caterer who is experienced with the venue. We went with Blue Heron and we really loved their food; they also did a great job with event setup. Note that if you go with Chabot, the biggest expense of your wedding budget will be the caterer as the caterer will provide all of the setup and furniture for the event in addition to food and drink service. Therefore, if budget is of concern, I would recommend getting a rough quote from one or more of Chabot’s preferred caterers prior to booking the venue so that you can get an idea of what the rough cost of the venue + furniture + setup + catering would be. Worth noting: Chabot has strict rules about fire and anything that could make a mess. Candle flames must be two inches below the glass. No sparklers. No flower petals, glitter, rice, bird seed, etc. But it’s worth it, it’ll just force you to be creative. We had our flower kids use bubble guns (a suggestion from Samantha) instead of flower petals.

The team at the Chabot did a great job facilitating our wedding, and the venue was excellent - we used the planetarium for our ceremony, and the 2nd floor Spees for the reception ...

Strengths: \- Nicole, Samantha, and the other staff at the CSSC were helpful and professional. They assisted in planning the event (thinking through what spaces work well for what activities), worked well with other vendors (including our band who was new to the space), and were accessible and effective on the day of the wedding which helped ensure the event went smoothly and was fun for all \- The event space is visually interesting so you do not need much (if any) decoration - we did no florals beyond bouquets and simple table decorations \- Exhibits and telescope viewings allow guests more options for activities beyond the common drinks and dancing (which you can also do) \- Venue offers the option to rent furniture, which is one fewer thing to think about \- CSSC provides a list of recommended vendors can be useful for narrowing search (even for services where they do not require you to select from the list) Things to think about \- Some restrictions on vendors (catering specifically) mean you cannot fully customize and does add costs, but also means that vendors are pre-vetted \- Renting rooms/areas for pre-wedding prep is extra - be advised \- Telescope viewings subject to weather \- While we have heard it can be difficult to get rides to/from the venue, none of our guests had issues (but several did opt to carpool) Overall, it was a great experience made possible by the site and the team at the CSSC and we are very happy with our choice

0, two months after we got engaged, and right in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic. We worked with Samantha, Nicole, and Victoria, who were all awesome. From the get-go the Chabot staff were extremely flexible and accommodating, and that only continued throughout our experience with them (we had to reschedule once due to Covid). Rain was threatening the day of our ceremony, and the Chabot staff did not miss a beat with helping us through a backup plan. Our guests had a great time, we had an awesome time, and we can't recommend Chabot highly enough as a venue for geeky weddings.

We absolutely loved having our wedding at the Chabot Space and Science Center! We'd initially booked our wedding for September of 2020 but obviously had to push the event to 2021. ...

Samantha at Chabot was very flexible and understanding, and made it easy to change our date. She was very communicative with us during the entire process of planning the wedding and postponing the wedding, and kept us up-to-date with the goings on of the museum as protocols shifted. Getting to finally have the event we'd been planning for almost three years was totally worth the wait. The backdrop of the telescope domes on the observation deck were beautiful and romantic, and our guests really enjoyed the unique venue. They also had a great time with the telescope viewings. It was exactly the cool experience we were hoping for. It also felt great to put money towards a nonprofit venue that uses the funds for educational purposes. We can't wait to go back and visit the museum again!

She was able to present us a very affordable package for our microwedding and worked with us and our caterer to ensure that everyone had everything they needed for our big night. Nicole is also amazing, she helped us make sure everything ran smoothly the day of.

We could not be more pleased with Samantha at the Chabot Space & Science Center. My husband and I were looking for an outdoor space to host our microceremony during COVID. Samantha...

was responsive, professional, and exceedingly flexible. She let us look at the venue before our wedding so we could get a sense of the space and recommended a great florist to help us decorate. When the weather changed 48 hours before our scheduled ceremony and authorities recommended evacuating the Hills because of high winds, a red flag warning, and an imminent power outage, Samantha worked with us to reschedule our ceremony so that it happened five hours earlier, allowing us to avoid the inclement weather. This obviously means that we weren't able to do the telescope viewing that is normally included in Chabot's wedding packages, but we're looking forward to using the telescopes eventually when it's safer to do so. We were so impressed by Samantha's efficiency and competency. During a really stressful weekend when we had to make quick decisions with less than a day's notice, we knew we could count on Samantha to support us and help make sure that in the end we got married. The venue is also beautiful. It's set in the middle of a redwood forest on the top of a mountain. It's extremely quiet except for birds and the odd daytime hiker, which we only saw because we had to move it to the daytime (and didn't mind anyway). Samantha also helped us find a spot in the redwood forest to take pictures, and they turned out great! If you are looking for a place to safely get married with a small number of people during the pandemic (we only had our immediate families there), I highly recommend the Chabot Space & Science Center. The bathrooms felt safe (the stalls and extra sinks are closed to support social distancing), you can use the office to change (and it's mostly empty because astronomers work in the middle of the night!), and there's plenty of room outside for everyone to socially distance and yet still hear each other because of how quiet it is up there.

The observatory itself sits on top of a hill that catches a beautiful sunset during the ceremony and reception. Chabot provided chairs and tables for our reception and set them up in advance for us. We were able to bring our own food and drinks, which was important to us. Most of all, the staff and venue coordinator (Samantha) were all incredibly kind and patient with us as we navigated planning a wedding during COVID. Would 10/10 recommend them any day.

g also happened to be 2 days before the Bay Area Secure in Place. Two Weeks Later, we are happy to report that no guest is sick. Chabot’s proactive response and professionalism was a big factor. The museum went above and beyond in communicating with us at every step of the rapidly changing circumstances that were occurring at that time. Nicole P and her team did such a good job. We used the planetarium and the “stage direction” and cues involved were something we hadn’t even considered, but it went off without a single problem. The museum has so much to offer guests and is a wonderful space. It also feels so good to work with a community nonprofit and not a corporate hotel space. Besides being our wedding venue , it’s just a special place and you should go there and learn about space.

orable venue. We did the whole shebang and rented out the entire venue - so our ceremony was in the planetarium (kicked off the night with a planetarium show), our cocktail hour was upstairs in the 2nd floor Spees exhibit area, and our reception/dancing was in the astronomy hall. We had 145 people and fit great. The sky was clear and the telescopes were a huge hit (it was a bit chilly outside so there weren't really many members of the public there which worked well for ensuring our guests didn't wait in too long of a line). We did minimal decorations (mostly lighting) since the venue has so much personality. We worked with Amy initially and Nicole later in the planning process and they were both very responsive and helpful. Amy moved a few months ago and the transition to Nicole was seamless - we were in great hands. Nicole was also our planetarium operator and she was extremely helpful in crafting our planetarium ceremony, particularly with editing the show (flying through stars with a custom playlist we made) and programming various visual effects during the ceremony (we had a nebula in the sky when guests walked in, some shooting stars during the ceremony and two galaxies collide when we kissed!) Chabot offers so many different variations on rental packages so you can rent out different portions of the museum across a broad spectrum of price-points (other museums we looked at were WAY more expensive, and didn't really have price variations in their options). Also, it's an education non-profit so it feels nice that the venue fee is going towards science education. (Budgeting note: you more or less have to go off of their pre-approved caterers list, so I'd recommend getting catering quotes early since that has a big budget impact)

d the museum that day to try to keep the smoke smell from entering the venue. I wasn’t too worried about the smoke but I really appreciated the extra consideration she went through to help our day go a little smoother. I really wanted to do our first look on viewing deck but breathing well comes first! Later on in the evening while we were dancing she comes and finds me to tell me that the sky has magically cleared up and they’d open a telescope! Astronomy hall was already a party so I said it was ok. She was so thoughtful and accommodating. Back to the review. My husband and I were lucky enough to have a tour on Monday, a day they’re closed. We were just blown away. Then my ‘celestial theme’ wedding all came together. It’s just an incredible venue especially with the updated second floor. Everyone kept telling me it was the best wedding they’ve ever been to and I know it’s cause of the venue. Also being there in the evening is a completely different experience. The lights pops and it makes for beautiful photos. I LOVE Chabot Space and Science Center.

all our needs. Specifically Amy went above and beyond for us and was a pleasure to work with throughout the planning process. She also worked very well with our other vendors and made sure the execution of the event was precise and as planned. Some benefits of getting married at Chabot include using the surrounding redwoods for photography (first look photos, family portraits, etc.). The facility itself provides easy parking and is very accessible to everyone and is well equipped to handle weddings. We had so many guests tell us that this was the most unique and fun wedding they've ever attended. With all the personal touches Chabot provided and allowed us to incorporate it never felt like a one-size-fits-all venue (you can get a laser show!). The spaces available within the Center allowed us to customize the size and scope of our event to what we wanted. Our only con would be that they have a preferred providers list for caterers with a $1000 buyout to use an outside caterer. The catering list includes many well respected outfits- however, given the cost of catering a wedding in the Bay Area we felt slightly constrained due to the limited size of the list. Overall we were extremely pleased with Chabot as a venue and the staff were professional, organized, and outstanding to work with.

d the Observatory, we knew it was perfect. The different levels allowed us to have the ceremony in one spot, then reception in another, differentiating the two events without having to go far. The view was spectacular, looking out over the bay area, during a fabulous sunset. We had rented one of the telescope observatories to view the Jupiter, but it also provided shelter for when the cold weather set in, which is hard to avoid in the Bay area at night. The main center was also open to the guests for visiting, this was really interesting for those people interested about space. We were so far up in the hills and as far away from civilization as possible, that we were able to play our music as loud as we wanted with out any complaints. Which made for a great night of dancing. The event coordiator for the site also provide us, without charge, 2 seperate rooms for both bridal parties to get ready in, which was a nice surprise. The coordinator was a great help in everything as well. The even provided a security guard to keep the general public out of the party. The coolest thing that most guests liked was the way the fog rolled in later in the evening. It created a blanket-like effect and kept much of the heat in. It also created a real dramatic sci-fi apperance that many liken to the movie, 'Log;The main thing I would warn people about the site would be the possible foggy and windy weather. We did rent the telescope, but because of the fog in July, was unable to view anything. However the observatory did remain open for visiting and keeping warm. The wind kept blowing out the candles set up, but we knew this was a possiblity when we chose this time of year. Also, because the center is a public facility, it had to stay open until 5 which meant we couldn't start setting up until 4:30, luckily I wanted a sunset wedding.
