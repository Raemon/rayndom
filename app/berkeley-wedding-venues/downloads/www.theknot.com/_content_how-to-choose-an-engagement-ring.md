Ring shopping, whether you're the future to-be-wed or a partner set on surprising their significant other, is a big deal. It's no surprise that many are left wondering how to choose an engagement ring—it can feel overwhelming to settle on just one that will be loved for a lifetime. While the technical details, like the 4Cs of diamonds, obviously matter, it's just as important to choose the perfect engagement ring that fits your personality, style and overall lifestyle. "The right design should complement how you live and what you love, so it becomes something you never want to take off," explains Alexandra Beth, a private jeweler and owner of [Alexandra Beth Fine Jewelry](https://alexandrabeth.com/) based in New York City. "It should feel natural, not forced."

[READ MORE Follow These Steps When You Buy an Engagement Ring ](https://www.theknot.com/content/engagement-ring-buying-steps)

[Buying an engagement ring](https://www.theknot.com/content/engagement-ring-buying-steps) should never be taken lightly. This is a huge purchase (and a huge gift) and is meant to be something you'll wear forever. "You want it to go with what you wear, who you are and what you do," says Sara Beth Brown, GIA-certified jeweler and owner of [Brown Jewelers](https://brownjewelers.com/) based in Roswell, Georgia. Here are some things to keep in mind when choosing the perfect ring. 

## Think About Your Most Loved Pieces of Jewelry 

There are a lot of engagement ring options out there (a lot is putting it mildly, to be honest), so if you have no idea how to pick an engagement ring, start by considering the jewelry you already own and love. Similarly, if you're shopping for someone, start paying attention to the pieces they wear often. Consider which metal is most common in your collection—you may want an [engagement ring metal](https://www.theknot.com/content/engagement-ring-metal-types) that matches most of your pieces. 

Take note of the style of the jewelry and the kind of stones that are the most loved. "If you're someone who loves a [colored gemstone](https://www.theknot.com/content/colored-gemstones-101), you could consider something like sapphire side stones in a three-stone ring, or stacking a band with colored gemstones alongside your engagement ring," Brown suggests. "Or, for example, if you gravitate toward classic jewelry like pearls, maybe that's a signal to go with a more classic or traditional style." And for someone who tends to love big, colorful pieces for every day, she recommends more of a statement engagement ring.

## Consider Your Overall Personal Style 

A jewelry collection isn't the only hint as to how to pick the perfect engagement ring—the clothes you wear and your overall personal style matter too. "Start by thinking about your partner's personal style," Beth says. "Are they classic and minimalist or bold and trend-forward?" For someone with a simpler, classic style, a more traditional engagement ring may be best. For someone who tends to think outside of the box, a [unique engagement ring](https://www.theknot.com/content/unique-engagement-ring-ideas) could be the way to go. 

## Remember That Your Day-to-Day Routine Matters

Your job and day-to-day activities may indicate how to choose an engagement ring style. After all, you want a ring you can wear as often as possible, not something you feel you need to remove before you do just about anything. Brown recommends a [low-profile engagement ring](https://www.theknot.com/content/low-profile-engagement-rings) for someone who works with their hands or someone who works in the medical field and wears gloves every day—that way the prongs don't get caught on everything. "Or you can pick a wedding band that is more substantial and just wear the wedding band when you're working as opposed to the full set," she notes. 

## Don't Forget About the Little Details 

One thing many people don't think about is the care and maintenance of an engagement ring. Because they're worn every day, they can get dirty fast, and it's nice to have them as clean and sparkly as possible. Be realistic about how you're going to care for your ring. "If you are someone who never cleans your jewelry, you can set it in a mounting that will cover the bottom of the diamond so nothing can get in under it, like a bezel setting," Brown suggests, adding that the bezel setting is "very protective" and can also be great for someone who works with their hands a lot.

You should also think about the ring's durability. Diamonds might be the strongest gems on the planet, but they can still get damaged. "It's been a trend recently to have fewer prongs on fancy-shaped diamonds, but it makes the diamond more susceptible to damage," Brown says. "It's not something I would recommend. Even if you're the most careful person in the world, you never know when you're going to accidentally hit the diamond in the wrong spot." 

## Try Everything on in Person

It's absolutely possible to shop for an engagement ring online, but your best bet is to go to an actual store and look at the rings in person. Jewelry, like anything else, can look different on a computer screen rather than right in front of you, and it can also look different when it's on your hand. "Try on everything," Brown encourages. "We want you to explore and create an atmosphere where you can try on all different shapes, sizes and styles. Once you do that, it really helps you narrow down organically what you like and don't like on your hand." 

## Come Prepared With Some Details

If you're shopping for your significant other and want it to be a surprise, having them try on rings obviously isn't really an option. For a true surprise, you may never even have the conversation about what type of ring they want. In that case, Brown recommends knowing some personal info about your partner that you can share with a jeweler who can help. "I always ask lots of questions about them," Brown says. "Like, what does he or she wear? What's their personal style like? Do they wear a ton of jewelry? What color metal do they usually wear? I also have them show me a lot of pictures of their partner, as this helps me to get an idea of what this person would like." 

If you're shopping for someone else and feeling really clueless, another option is to enlist the help of someone else who knows them—their best friend, their mom, their sister or someone similarly close to them. 

## Work Closely With a Trusted Jeweler 

Don't underestimate how helpful a jeweler is when you're feeling overwhelmed. Even if they just met you, they can still help make your shopping experience less stressful and find something you'll love. "They can help narrow down shapes, metals and styles that align with your vision," Beth says, noting that jewelers can also help you create a [custom engagement ring](https://www.theknot.com/content/custom-engagement-ring-design-101) for a personal and thoughtful option.

## Make Sure It's Something You Genuinely Love 

It sounds obvious, but it's important to point out that the ring you ultimately settle on is one you genuinely love—or, if you're buying for someone, one you feel good about purchasing. It's easy to be swayed by current trends or styles, or what you think you should be purchasing, but you have to stay true to yourself. "The most important thing is that the ring feels like you," Beth says. "Trends come and go, but the right ring should reflect your personality and feel timeless."
