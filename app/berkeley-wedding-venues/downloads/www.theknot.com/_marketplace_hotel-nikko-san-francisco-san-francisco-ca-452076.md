Our wedding at the Nikko was amazing! We had the best night of our lives. Our guests are still raving about how great it was. Andrea really did everything possible to make our d...

ay special. Going into the process, I expected that the catering manager would merely make sure that the room was booked and that the food and beverages were served. Andrea went above and beyond to make sure that the overall atmosphere was appropriate, from discussing linens to placement of tables and timing of events like toasts. She also made sure that I was completely satisfied with every appetizer and dish served well before the wedding. I think that those details are a large part of what made the wedding fun for everyone. The bridal suite was amazing and the regular guest rooms were great also.
