Description

Make an unforgettable entrance in Shaughna's beaded lace sheath silhouette. There isn’t a world where this wedding dress design doesn’t combine sophistication and edginess. With her lace spaghetti straps, chic straight neckline, and detailed detachable overskirt, how could she not? Her corset-style bodice molds to the bride’s figure, while her cascading train ensures all eyes are on the bride as they walk down the aisle. Better prepare the glam squad before showing them this beauty!
