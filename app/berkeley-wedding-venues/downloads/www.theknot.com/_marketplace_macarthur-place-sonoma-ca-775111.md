### About this venue

MacArthur Place is a beautiful wedding venue in Sonoma, CA, less than an hour’s drive from San Francisco. This award-winning luxury resort and spa is situated on a stunning six-acre estate in the California wine country. There, historic farm buildings and intimate gardens combine to create a charming and relaxing setting for your celebrations. Between the leafy tree canopies, lush archways, and winding flagstone paths, you and your guests will feel a sense of calm the moment you arrive at MacArthur Place. Ideal for weddings of up to 100 individuals, this Sonoma Hotel offers several indoor and outdoor spaces for the festivities. Outside, choose between the gardens, where you can host a ceremony of up to 20 amidst towering oaks and redwoods, or the West Lawn, where up to 100 guests can watch you exchange your vows in an open-air setting. Intimate indoor ceremonies of less than 50 guests can be held inside the Event Salon, which also doubles as an elegant reception space for up to 125 guests. Afterward, enjoy a cocktail reception on the West Lawn or the Coach House Patio, a semi-private setting with stylish lounge seating arranged around a cozy firepit. The private dining room is an alternate space for cocktail hour, with a chic and sophisticated vibe that’s ideal for intimate dinners of up to 18 guests. Finally, the Layla Restaurant can accommodate up to 24 people in a modern farmhouse setting. Whether you choose to host a small gathering or a more lavish event, the dedicated wedding and event planners at MacArthur Place will guide you every step of the way. Not only does the in-house catering team offer delicious menus of seasonal, farm-fresh dishes, but couples can also choose from a range of customizable packages designed with their needs in mind. Included with every package is event setup and breakdown, in addition to complimentary parking, a list of preferred vendors, and on-site food and beverage services. Event room blocks offer comfort and convenience to your loved ones, who can also make use of the spa throughout their stay. From the natural beauty of the property to the carefully curated list of available services, MacArthur Place offers an idyllic setting for your journey into marital bliss.

We got engaged while staying at MacArthur Place on vacation so it was naturally on our short list of possible venues. From my first phone call with Linda, their event coordinator,...

every interaction we had with her and her staff was wonderful. Linda was quick to respond, was completely on top of things, and really went the extra mile to ensure that we were going to have the wedding we wanted. She was a dream to work with every step of the way. The hotel itself was perfect for our needs. Everything about the place is beautiful and inviting. The different gardens that cover the grounds provided our photographer with a variety of different backdrops to use when taking pictures. The Veranda Garden is the perfect spot for an outdoor ceremony. We used one of the private rooms off of their restaurant for the reception, so it was just a two minute stroll from the ceremony to dinner. All of our guests raved about the food (I've never had a Chicken Marsala as good as the one they served that night). And the staff was very friendly and attentive. As for the cost, it wasn't cheap, but it was a lot cheaper than the other venues that we looked at in the Sonoma area. Part of it is that they are equipped to do the catering and set up themselves, so you don't have to bother with renting chairs and tables or dealing with separate catering fees. We feel that the experience we had was well worth the price. A wedding is a very personal thing. We all have our own hopes and dreams that we bring with us to that day. For us, MacArthur Place was the absolute right - or dare I say perfect - venue. We can't wait to go back next year to celebrate our anniversary.

We had our rehearsal dinner and welcome party at MacArthur Place. Their service was exceptional. The property is beautiful as well.
