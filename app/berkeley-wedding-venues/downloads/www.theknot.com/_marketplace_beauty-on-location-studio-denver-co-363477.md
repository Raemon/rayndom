Liz and her stylists are incredible and you could not hope for a better team to provide hair and makeup services for your wedding, or any time you want to feel glamorous and pamper...

ed. It was important to me to have a hair and makeup team that understands that their energy in the getting-ready room helps guide the feeling of the whole day. Liz embodies this philosophy completely and brings a sense of calm to a chaotic day, gentle authority, genuine interest in you as a person, and the ability to adjust if things go awry that comes with almost 20 years of experience. We were fortunate enough to have three stylists with us and each was a consummate professional, but also super personable and incredibly knowledgeable. They take care of each other at BOL and also their clients. My officiant required vegan products, and BOL was able to accommodate her preferences and other skin sensitivities when other companies could not. Many of the ladies in my wedding party were impressed at how Liz, Jha, and Christine were able to create beautiful styles from inspirational photos alone and their hair was able to hold a curl for the whole day! I loved how both my hair and makeup turned out and I am so grateful for the experience. I will definitely be reconnecting with these ladies for future formal looks.

she was, of course, my hair and makeup artist for the big day. I cannot say enough nice things about Rachelle -she really listened to me and was able to execute such a beautiful, natural, but more enhanced version of me! She really felt like a friend. The rest of the team including Mariali, Liz, and Jennifer, were able to execute everyone's looks flawlessly. My party was so thankful for the services that were provided and I was so thankful to how well organized it all felt on the day. I even had Rachelle come with us to the venue and she helped me and the entire party with touch ups and general support! I would hire the BoL team again in a heartbeat! Thank you!

Rachelle was incredible! I had been ghosted by other vendors and was starting to lose hope until I messaged Beauty on Location. Rachelle did my trail run and the day of make up and...

it was such a lovely experience. I told Rachelle I don’t wear a lot of makeup in my day to day and wanted to look like myself but more polished and glowy. Rachelle took that bit of direction and executed such a fantastic look. I really appreciated that Rachelle’s kind approach and how she never pushed me in a different direction. It was refraining because the previous consultations I did with other companies often leaned in the “are you sure you want a natural / soft look? Don’t you want to be GLAM??” Rachelle was a breath of fresh air; she asked questions and checked in throughout the process and made me feel at ease. The final look was exactly what I wanted — my hair was done beautifully in a low bun and my makeup had a soft emphasis on my eyes and natural blush cheeks and a soft berry lip. I still looked like myself but way more even and bright. Ask for Rachelle if you book with Beauty on Location, you won’t regret it!

hing feel so easy and comfortable. We did a trial with her (which we highly recommend) and she spent the whole day with us—two brides—trying out different looks, talking through options, and helping us find the right balance so we still felt like ourselves. She took photos and detailed notes during the trial so we didn’t have to worry about remembering anything for the big day. And it was such a bonus that she came to us for the trial—it made everything super convenient. Haley was great at communicating leading up to the wedding, and on the day of, she was a calm and fun presence in the getting ready room.

Very long review but I urge you to read the whole thing. I will start with the one positive- The only saving grace was my makeup artist Jay. She was professional and communicated ...

well. She is very talented and I was very happy with my makeup. Unfortunately I did not have a good experience with Beauty on Location for my wedding in June. I am not a girly girl so the process of finding hair and makeup artists for my wedding was already a stressful experience for me. To start, the process of obtaining information and booking my trial was convoluted and more difficult than necessary. I had to "speak with" (email) at least 3 people before getting the information I needed. We started off rough the day of the wedding when the artist argued with me about a last minute change on which room to get ready in (down stairs living room vs master bathroom). The venue was my grandparents house and the possibility of a location change was discussed previously due to my grandfathers health issues. It should not have been an issue. Not only did this waste about 20 minutes of getting ready time but also broke the #1 rule of not stressing out the Bride. Very disappointing. Finally, more than one of my bridesmaids ended up redoing their own makeup and hair. The artists either did something completely different from what they asked for or it didn't last long enough to even get through photos let alone the ceremony. Again, extremely disappointing especially after paying ~$300 each. Maybe I'm the wrong person to ask since it is not an experience I am used to but I was very disappointed with the services provided. I would only recommend the make up artist Jay individually, not the company.

with how to get the lighting and set up they needed. My girls and myself all looked and felt beautiful! Unfortunately, my hair on my wedding day was completely different than what was agreed upon during my trial. This could certainly be a dealbreaker for someone hoping to get a specific look on their big day. I also didn't like that gratuity was added to my initial service fee as I believe it is something to be given after the service based on the quality. They were okay with removing it from the fee and allowing each girl to pay gratuity individually on the day of the wedding but then texted me to call out by name the girl that didn't tip them by accident.

I can't say enough how great of an experience I had with BOL Studio from Day 1 through my wedding day! Our artists were Jamie, Audrey and Brandy. Jamie was my lead artist and beyon...

d just her pure talent, she was an absolute pleasure to work with. I did one hair trial and two make-up trials as I wasn't sure what look I was going for at the time. Jamie listened to every little critique and ultimately made my wedding day vision come to life! I am SO impressed with how my hair and makeup came out the day of. I really couldn't imagine any better result! She created such a stunning and romantic look! Also, I want to give a huge shout out to Audrey and Brandy who took care of many of my bridesmaids and some other friends and family. ALL of my bridesmaids (many of whom have had some not so good experiences with wedding H&M in the past) were SO happy with their experience with BOL! Overall, BOL provides a top notch service. They gave me and my ladies the perfect combo of naturalness and glam, which was everything I was hoping for and more! Our services also lasted well through the whole day despite being 11,000 FT on a mountaintop on a windy day! I also wanted to give a HUGE shout out to Danielle at BOL who was my point of contact through this whole process. She was super kind, communicative and helpful!!

Rachelle was my lead stylist and she was awesome - I did two trials, even changed my mind about hair/makeup again before the wedding (I am indecisive!) but she nailed every look I brought to her. I looked amazing in all the trials she did and also the final result on our wedding day, couldn't be happier! Rachelle was so sweet and easy to talk to on top of her phenomenal hair and makeup skills. Prices were reasonable/competitive, not the cheapeast out there but also not the most expensive and you get great service. Highly recommend BoL!

Rachelle was also able to completely camouflage a member of the bridal party’s black eye from a last-minute fall, which was impressive and a huge relief.

a combination of me not really knowing what I wanted and the stylist and I simply not communicating well enough. But when I called to discuss coming in for another trial, the owner was so understanding and wanted to make sure that I felt comfortable and beautiful, so she scheduled me another appointment at no extra charge. I ended up going with a different stylist, Jessica, and was SO happy with the Colorado chic look I ended up with. That first stylist I had was wonderful too and actually also came along to do my other ladies day-of and they all looked gorgeous!
