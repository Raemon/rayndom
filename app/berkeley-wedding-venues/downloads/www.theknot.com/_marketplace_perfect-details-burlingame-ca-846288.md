Amazing, personable service. I highly recommend Perfect Details. You won't be disappointed!

Perfect Details has delivered again. I bought a hair comb from their website and as soon as I ordered it, I wasn't sure if the pearls were white or ivory and Lisa checked my order...

and her stock and confirmed it was in ivory. They really know how to treat customers and have very unique accessories. I spent a week looking for a hair comb that looked like the one being sold by Perfect Details and nothing came close. Beautiful accessories and great service. High recommend for brides to consider shopping at Perfect Details.

Lisa at Perfect Details is amazing and went above and beyond to get me my crystal sash for my wedding dress. She is professional and really knows how to deliver for customers. Th...

e sash was at a great price and she was helpful in assisting me in finding the perfect size! They have really great accessories on their website. I have an eye on a hair comb for my wedding as well that will go perfectly with my sash.

Lisa of Perfect Details is absolutely fabulous and so knowledgeable about accessorizing. When I worked with her for my own accessories, she asked all the write questions (like neck...

line of your dress , she even asked for a photo of it), colors of your wedding, bridesmaid dress styles, etc. I ended up having her accessorize my whole bridal party and even the mom's. I absolutely loved working with Lisa. She has an incredible eye for beautiful jewelry. Will definitely be ordering more accessories from her for future events or even everyday wear.

Lisa of Perfect Details is absolutely amazing and has an incredibly unique talent for helping you figure out all your styling needs for your wedding day or any special occasion for...

that matter. I wasn't sure what to do for myself and my wedding party but after consulting with Lisa (and she asked all these questions I never even thought of!) we settled on some gorgeous sets of jewelry. My bridesmaids were thrilled and the pieces were perfect for the style we were going for!! Absolutely love Lisa. She has a stunning collection and I definitely recommend emailing/contacting her for personal styling needs!

I can't say enough good things about Perfect Details. My bride-to-be had so many questions about our wedding, and I could offer little input regarding jewelry, shoes, and other ac...

cessories for her and her bridesmaids. I felt so relieved after she emailed "Ask Rachel" and got the help and answers she needed. We even got advice about finding the right photographer! Thank you, Perfect Details!

Lisa is amazing! I made an appointment with her this evening to look at necklaces for my wedding gown. She spent almost 2 hours with me discussing what styles would look best, show...

ing me necklaces, and finding other options online. She had a lot of great ideas about what styles would and wouldn't work with my dress. She also had insight into customizations that the jewelry designers could do (eg. changing the setting from silver to gold for a crystal chain I liked, changing colors, swapping out stone size, etc). Incredibly helpful and insightful. We have it narrowed down to a couple of necklaces that I'm going to sleep on to decide. Amazing customer service!

My sister is remarrying.When we were together over Christmas we did an internet search for bridal accessories because she lives in Nevada out in the hinterlands so to speak. We fou...

nd Perfect Details & we're glad we did! Rachel has one of the best online bridal collections of quality designer jewelry & accessories! Her service was wonderful! We were nervous about ordering online but her service & prompt follow up to all our concerns including several personal phone calls made the experience a pleasure & that doesn't even include the beauty & quality of the jewelry we received! I can't say enough about her & how she turned an anxious occasion into fun.
