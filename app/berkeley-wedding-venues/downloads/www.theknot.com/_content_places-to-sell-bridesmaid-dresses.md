Every bride promises it: "You'll be able to wear this bridesmaid dress again and again!" But really, how many have you reworn? More likely, you're scouring the internet for places to sell bridesmaid dresses on your next closet cleanout. So, if you're wondering what to do with an old bridesmaid dress—and maybe how to make a little money back in the process—we're here to help. 

But it's not just about selling. Used bridesmaid dresses are a great option for those looking to _buy_. When you're looking at used bridesmaid dresses online, typically, they've been worn just a single time, have been professionally dry cleaned since, and are being sold at a steep discount to the original retail cost. What's not to love? Buying secondhand is an especially great option for bridesmaids in mismatched wedding parties or those assigned a specific [bridesmaid dress color](https://www.theknot.com/content/what-color-bridesmaid-dresses-should-you-have) but are free to choose their own specific dress. 

FEATURED VIDEO FROM THE KNOT

For help, we turned to Mallory Smith, a spokesperson for [Poshmark](https://poshmark.com/), one of the top clothing resale platforms. Here, she offers tips and tricks for those looking to sell used bridesmaid dresses online—and for those looking to buy. 

**In this article:**

## The Best Places to Sell Bridesmaid Dresses

Pre-internet consignment shops were among the only places that would buy used bridesmaid dresses; now if you're wondering where to sell bridesmaid dresses, you're most likely looking online. Each platform has its own method: Some require the seller to handle listing and shipping, and others take the whole job off your plate. Here, we break down some of the top sites where you can sell bridesmaid dresses. 

### Poshmark 

**For sellers:** With 80 million users, Poshmark is the top resale platform available. It's like shopping meets social media: Sellers can have profiles and followers and get likes; they can share their listings to their social followings to drive sales. Sellers create their own listings and engage directly with potential buyers, but Poshmark makes shipping easy by providing prepaid labels. (Keep reading for some pro Poshmark selling tips.) 

**For buyers:** You'll find worn-once go-to bridesmaid brands like Birdy Grey, Jenny Yoo and BHLDN on the platform for a fraction of their original prices. For luxury pieces with hefty price tags (over $500), the item will be shipped to Poshmark's authentication department before making its way to you, so you can feel confident in your purchase. 

[Try Poshmark](https://poshmark.com/)

### ThredUp

**For sellers:** Think of ThredUp as a modern-day consignment store. You'll ship the item to the platform (rather than directly to the buyer) and they'll handle the listing and selling for you; then, once it sells, you'll get a kickback of the list price. (For items in the bridesmaid dress category, you'll likely earn anywhere from 30% to 80% of the sale price.) Pro tip: It pays to sell more items—the more you sell, the lower the service fee per item—so go through your closet to make room for a full refresh before selling just the used bridesmaid dresses. 

**For buyers:** If your goal is to thrift bridesmaid dresses, you can do it on ThredUp without leaving the house. There are literally thousands of brands on the platform (from David's Bridal to Monique Lhuillier), marked anywhere up to 90% off their retail price. Pieces are inspected for quality and condition by the ThredUp team and showcased on dress forms rather than in photos on their original wearer.

### Borrowing Magnolia 

**For sellers:** There is a flat fee to sell bridesmaid dresses ($35-$50) or wedding gowns on Borrowing Magnolia rather than a commission or percentage taken from the sale price. You'll create your own listing and provide images, then communicate directly with buyers. Listing brand and product name is huge here; since it's a wedding-specific resale site, bridesmaids may come looking with specific styles in mind. 

**For buyers:** Searching is easy as you can filter by size, designer, silhouette and more. You can communicate directly with the sellers to negotiate on price and ask questions about how a dress fits or—better yet—how it looks in those all-important wedding photos! 

[Try Borrowing Magnolia](https://www.borrowingmagnolia.com/)

### Nearly Newlywed

**For sellers:** Known primarily as a site to sell [used wedding dresses](https://www.theknot.com/content/used-wedding-dresses-buy-sell-online), Nearly Newlywed (formerly called PreOwnedWeddingDresses) now has a robust bridesmaid marketplace as well. There's a listing fee of just $5 for resale bridesmaid dresses, and sellers keep 70% to 80% of the profit. (Nearly Newlywed dispenses the payment after the sale rather than coming directly from the buyer.)

**For buyers:** It's not just gently used bridesmaid dresses—there are also brand-new overstock and never-worn sample pieces on Nearly Newlywed. There's a process with purchase in which you record a video of unboxing and inspecting the piece, and you have 72 hours from delivery to request a refund if need be. 

[Try Nearly Newlywed](https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&u=1030781&m=80182&afftrack=TK-places-to-sell-bridesmaid-dresses&urllink=preownedweddingdresses.com)

### Vestaire Collective 

**For sellers:** If you were part of a big-budget wedding or have a designer bridesmaid dress, Vestaire specializes in luxury fashion resale. There are two options for bridesmaid dress resale on Vestaire: Sellers can list their own pieces, communicate with sellers and ship with pre-paid labels. Or, through the platform's VIP consignment program, they can hand off their pieces and have Vestaire handle the sale. 

**For buyers:** You'll find top brands like Reformation, Betsy & Adam and Amsale at Vestaire. It's an incredibly trusted platform with a focus on quality control and product authentication for both buyers and sellers alike.

## Tips for Selling Used Bridesmaid Dresses

So now you know _where_ , but you also need to know _how_ to sell used bridesmaid dresses. Here's a step-by-step guide. 

### Clean the Dress

"Make sure to get clothes in the best possible condition, whether it's dry cleaning or a spin through the washing machine," Smith says. "Regardless of what you're listing, an item that's been well preserved has a better chance of selling quickly than one that's not properly cleaned."

### Take Good Photos

On many platforms, users are required to upload their own listings, including photos. "Make sure your photos are clear," Smith advises. "Take a few pictures of your item against a white background or in natural lighting to highlight its features like color, detailing and texture. Include multiple photos and capture your item from multiple angles: the back, the front and laid full out." On Poshmark, in particular, quality photos have a proven track record: "If you couple your cover shot with more than four photos, your item is 70% more likely to be purchased," Smith says.

### Be Precise 

Now for the listing description. "Write clear and accurate titles and descriptions for each listing," Smith says. "Highlight key features such as size, condition and brand. Be sure to mention relevant keywords like material and style—'one-shoulder,' 'strapless'—in the description to improve search visibility." (Pro tip: If you were looking to buy a dress yourself, what words would you type into the search bar? Include those!). You should include dress sizing and could even include your own measurements. "Including measurements such as waist and length in the listing and providing a description of how the item fits can give potential buyers more confidence in making a purchase."

Finally, check the proper boxes if it's an option. "On Poshmark, sellers can select the 'Bridesmaid' style tag to increase visibility for buyers looking for bridesmaid dresses," Smith says. "If a dress is [also] suitable for other occasions, like prom or cocktail parties, they can select additional style tags to broaden the listing's exposure."

### List the Brand Name 

The more detail, the better—but one detail in particular is maybe the most important of all in this category. "Be sure to add the brand name in the listing title and listing," Smith says. "People frequently search for specific brands, so including the brand of the item in your listing will help increase its visibility." Bridesmaids may have been given a specific directive and are looking for a particular dress secondhand. They may be searching for used Jenny Yoo bridesmaid dresses or used Revelry bridesmaid dresses. This step is key. "Adding a brand name increases the likelihood of making the sale by 110%," Smith says. 

### Engage 

Once your listing is live, stay on top of it. "Engage with offers," Smith advises. "If an offer is not as high as a seller is looking for, they can always send a counteroffer. Ignoring offers can lead to a missed sale." 

### Learn Best Practices for your Resale Site of Choice 

Each resale platform has its own intricacies, and you'll likely get better at it the more you sell (so keep these tips handy for your next closet cleanout). Poshmark has a few key features that can help you make sales faster and more efficiently. "With Smart List AI, sellers can simply upload a photo of an item, and the tool will generate a listing inclusive of the title, description and other key details for them—all the seller has to do is enter the price," Smith says. "This tool helps sellers create a high-quality listing with a detailed title and description in under 60 seconds." She also advises clicking "share to my followers" to increase exposure. 

## Tips for Buying Secondhand Bridesmaid Dresses

In this new era of [mismatched bridesmaid dresses](https://www.theknot.com/content/mismatched-bridesmaids-dress-tips), bridesmaids have way more options and resale or consignment bridesmaid dresses are becoming more popular. Given a few parameters, such as color or length, maids are looking at different [places to buy bridesmaid dresses](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridesmaid-dresses-online). Secondhand dresses are a great option for those on a budget or who simply don't want to spend big on something they'll potentially only wear once—but it's also a sustainable way to shop. Here are a few tips to make sure you nail it. 

### Ask Questions

"Don't be afraid to ask the seller questions," Smith says. "If you need more details about the dress—like measurements, fit or material—leave a comment and the seller will respond. Clear communication can help you ensure the dress is exactly what you're looking for." 

### Expand your Parameters 

These days, you can totally [wear a bridesmaid dress as a wedding guest](https://www.theknot.com/content/can-my-guests-match-my-maids) and vice versa—so don't limit yourself to searching keywords like "bridesmaid dress." Search for cocktail party dresses, eveningwear or even prom. You might be surprised by what you find. 

### Negotiate

"If you find a bridesmaid dress you love but the price feels high, don't hesitate to make an offer! Many sellers are open to negotiation," Smith says. "Plus, on Poshmark, if you 'like' an item, many sellers will send offers to likers, which means you could get an exclusive discount just by showing interest." While there's no specific percentage off retail that's a given, she's seen pieces by popular bridesmaid brands like Birdy Grey, Reformation and Show Me Your Mumu go for up to 50% off retail. "The final price of a bridesmaid dress can vary based on factors like the brand, item condition and demand," Smith says. But you never know unless you ask. 

### Move Quickly but Thoughtfully

Well-priced and in-demand items will go quickly on resale sites, so you'll want to be decisive. But remember, there's typically not an easy return policy on secondhand items. So expressing your interest by asking important questions about fit and condition right away is smart—and if the answers sit well, make an offer sooner rather than later.
