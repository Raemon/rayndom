Shawna Futagaki

Owner

I have been in the business for longer than I wish to admit, but just say , "I grew up in the floral industry". My background in clothing design and textiles and an MBA has helped me to grow this business into more than I could have ever imagined. I feel blessed with a great team of designers and consultants that keeps Flower Divas thriving and has allowed me to have more free time to travel, while still keeping my hands in the fire. I love to explore new trends in the wedding industry and learning new techniques. I hope to keep doing this another 40 years!

or at my wedding. My guests were complimenting my table centerpieces all night, including the little bud vases that were placed throughout our venue. Shawna not only arranged the most beautiful flowers ever but she knew how to use the space at the winery we had the reception at. She added lots of little details throughout the venue that just made the whole look so elegant and romantic. I wanted more organic and fluffy looking centerpieces and that is exactly what she gave us using gorgeous whites, peaches and even the French Anemones I was dying for. My bridal bouquet was a dream come true.

Everyone raved about the flowers at the wedding and how beautiful they were. My daughter was so happy with how the flowers turned out, they were exactly how she pictured they would be. You can't go wrong with the Flower Divas, I would use them again in a heartbeat.

r proposal to make sure it was exactly what we wanted. Both my groom and I were blown away when we walked into the reception room. We knew generally what the tables were going to look like because we had reviewed that with the caterers but the flowers just took the room to another level! There was variation between the tables (some short arrangements and some really tall because the room had enormously high ceilings). Also, everything from the ceremony room got re-used which was something that was important to us. The whole thing was beautiful!

worry about. Wedding color/theme, a list of how many bouquets, corsages, etc. and a budget. That was it. The flowers she picked GORGEOUS, the arrangement, BEAUTIFUL.
