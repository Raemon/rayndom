Description

Graceful and stylish, our classic Jade Chiffon gown is made for comfort and beauty. The lovely boat neckline provides coverage and is accented by hand-beaded lace appliques at the shoulders for a touch of excitement. The draped top flows over the body, and is completed with a sheath shape skirt that has a side slit for ease of movement.
