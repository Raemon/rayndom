### Make Your Own Pizza

![Make your own pizza display at Italian themed bridal shower](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/c498f94b-18d7-4350-9205-435f9ce78206~rs_768.h-cr_97.0.1637.1155)

Set out pizza dough and toppings, and let the guests make their own personal pizza. You can even have a pro come in and teach everyone how to make it—Italian style. 

### Serve Italian-Themed Cocktails

Nothing says Amalfi Coast quite like an Aperol spritz. Serve the staple drink in addition to wine and cheese to make sure you have all your Italy-theme bridal shower bases covered. 

### Play an Italy Trivia Game

See how much your guests know about Italy with a fun trivia game. Have people divide into teams and ask questions about everything from history to geography. Don't forget to buy a prize for the winner.
