Greene's Cleaners is fantastic! Greene's Cleaners worked with me on two special projects. I inherited two beautiful wedding veils of handmade Brussels lace from the 1920s. My grand...

mother brought them to the U.S. in the 1930s when she and my grandfather emigrated from Germany with their young daughters. The three sisters wore them in the late 1940s. Then their three granddaughters and two granddaughters-in-law wore them in the 1970s and 1980s. And their great-granddaughter wore one in 2007 at a lovely outdoor wedding at my parents’ home. Greene's Cleaners immediately appreciated that these antique veils are precious in our family and they wanted to know more about their history. They used our wedding pictures from over more than half a century to recommend that in the restoration process, the lovely long veil would return to its original lighter color. They suggested that in restoring the short veil their seamstress could make repairs. The veils turned out even better than expected, ready to be worn this summer by the next generation. Many thanks to Greene's Cleaners for appreciating our family story and treating us and our special antique veils so thoughtfully!

I am so glad that we chose Greene's to help us post- nuptial bliss! I am a bit of a sloppy person even on a careful day, and I was fairly terrified of what would happen to my gorge...

ous white silk dress after a day and night of running in the grass, eating steak and drinking alllll of the drinks. Greene's was able to get out all of the red wine and grass stains that were the result of our wedding fun- and they even mended a tear in the hem of my dress. I decided to chose the wedding gown preservation cleaning that Greene's provides as the pricing was competitive with other dry cleaner that I looked at. The end product was perfect- It is now in a lovely box with a picture mirror cut out so I can stare at the dress when I reminisce.
