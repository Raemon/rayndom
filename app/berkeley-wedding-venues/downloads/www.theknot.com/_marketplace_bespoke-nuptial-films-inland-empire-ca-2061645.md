chael was incredibly responsive and detailed, making the planning process seamless. On the day of the wedding, Michael and Maria exceeded all expectations. They were patient, kind, and made everyone feel at ease, which is so important on a big day filled with so many emotions. Their calm, positive energy truly added to the overall atmosphere of the day, and it felt like they were just as invested in making it special as we were. Though we haven’t received the final photos and video yet, I’m confident they will be as amazing as the experience we had with them. Highly recommend Bespoke Nuptial Films!

We had the pleasure of working with the incredibly talented videographer and photographer duo for my wedding, and I couldn't have been more thrilled with the results. From start to...

finish, Michael and Roddy were professional, friendly, and truly went above and beyond to capture every special moment of our big day. Not only were they incredibly skilled at their craft, but they also had a keen eye for detail and a knack for making everyone feel comfortable in front of the camera. They perfectly captured the emotions, the laughter, and the joy of the day in both the photos and the video, creating memories that we will cherish for a lifetime. Michael’s editing skills were top-notch, and the final products were simply breathtaking. The photos were beautifully composed, and the video was edited in a way that truly told the story of our wedding day. Michael and Roddy managed to capture all the important moments without being intrusive, and the end result was amazing! I recommend this videographer and photographer duo highly enough. If you want to work with professionals who are not only talented but also a joy to be around, look no further. They will exceed your expectations and deliver memories that you will treasure forever. Trust me, you won't regret choosing them for your special day! ♥️
