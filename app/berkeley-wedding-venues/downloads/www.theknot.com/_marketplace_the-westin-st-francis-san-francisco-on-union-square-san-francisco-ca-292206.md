Making our son and daughter-in-law's wedding on the 32nd floor of The Westin St Francis was the best idea and smartest decision! We live on the east coast and the bride and groom ...

live in the bay area. We knew the majority of the guests would be coming from out of town. This hotel made entertaining our guests for the weekend easy and a pleasure! No guest needed a car, and we didn't need to transport our guests anywhere for any weekend function. The hotel is in the heart of all the sightseeing our guests would pursue; the cable car is out the front door. The way the check-in/reception area is laid out, it was easy for our family to greet and meet our guests from the start and all thru the weekend in the lobby and cafe. The hotel rooms are spacious. We chose to have our wedding ceremony and celebration on the "32nd Floor". It has multiple spaces, modern and beautifully decorated, wrapped in floor-to-ceiling windows, and entirely private for an event. It was the perfect size for our crowd of 130 ppl. The Special Events Manager, Jenevieve Beaulieu, was so attentive and the most professional and helpful for the 1.5 years we worked with her! We chose a restaurant in the neighborhood that everyone was willing to walk to for the rehearsal dinner. Staying in the hotel where our wedding ceremony and celebration would occur made it very easy for me to check on vendors and details all thru the day of the wedding. I was able to see the 32nd Floor set up in advance so I would know where we could begin taking photos earlier in the day. At the end of the night, our flowers were taken to the room where our brunch would be held the next day, so we could enjoy them again- fabulous! We worked with Jenevieve for almost 1.5 years bc we had to postpone the wedding once, due to the Omicron outbreak. Jenevieve has tremendous experience with helping plan weddings in the hotel. She answers calls asap. Her demeanor is always delightful. She's positive and optimistic and aims to say "yes". She walked us thru the process of using the space and planning the menu. She recommended vendors and communicated with some on our behalf. She helped with the room block for our guests and communicated on our behalf with the dept in charge of reservations. It was easy to discuss our thoughts with her. She sought to execute new ideas. She made many valuable suggestions. We grew to rely on her and trust her judgment. She remained enthusiastic and focused on our wedding for 1.5 years despite having special events every weekend. She made us feel like a priority all the time. She's amazingly organized. I totally recommend making a wedding at the Westin St Francis because the event spaces are beautiful, the quality of the food and staff is excellent and Jenevieve is wonderful to work with. I especially recommend making a wedding there if you live out of town and/or many of your guests live out of town, because the convenience of staying at and attending events in one premier hotel, so ideally located, can't be beaten. We would choose to do it again.

here's a reason she's mentioned in most Westin reviews. She’s down-to-earth, relatable, and experienced. She is who you want behind the scenes to make sure all venue related accommodations, amenities, and services are impeccable for a wedding. Honestly, she’s more than that – she also helps keep you sane and reassured during the wedding planning process. Our wedding was during a COVID surge, and Jenevieve was flexible and accommodating in providing options and ideas to keep guests safe and happy. Her insight is invaluable – she lets you tap into her wealth of knowledge for suggestions on everything from décor, venue layout suggestions, wedding timeline, to local restaurants and activities for guests. The impression the wedding made on our guests and us was overwhelmingly positive. The Westin is lucky to have her – she is a primary reason we decided to have our wedding at The Westin St. Francis.

We could not have asked for a better venue or staff for our wedding. The Westin hosted us for six beautiful events throughout the hotel: rehearsal dinner, welcome reception, cockta...

il & wedding reception, and farewell brunch. The iconic style and ambiance of the hotel and venue space gave us a range of options for events and helped eliminate significant decor costs for each event. The wedding specialist is very professional and easy to work with. They also introduced us to our wedding planning dream team - AnyOccasion. Both supported us through two COVID-19 postponements and multiple changes to event plans and headcount. Each of our events was professionally staffed and well executed and our guests and vendors enjoyed every minute of every event. The location is also perfect for our destination wedding - our friends & family enjoyed seeing SF and benefited from ease of transit. I could not could not give them better praise or a higher recommendation - the Westin brought our wedding vision to life and was a pleasure to work with from start to finish.

Great venue and better even staff! The venue has different rooms depending on your guest count. We chose the St. Francis because of the amenities it was able to provide in house ...

without having to hire a ton of different vendors. We wanted to do both the ceremony and reception in one place without having to move around to different locations. It was also nice to have our rooms and guests close by in the event that we needed something or goes wrong, as something inevitably does on a wedding day/planned event. The entire venue itself was gorgeous, the lobby itself is iconic, reminiscent of an older, classier look, but modernizes as you ascend in glass elevators (think willy-wonka) to your room/event space. We rented out the 32nd floor which has a birds-eye view of the city and was recently refurbished (2019?) to have a more sleek, modern to the point where decorations aren't really necessary as the floor itself is surrounded by windows overlooking the city. A lot of venues in SF look dated or have restrictions, but the Westin was able to accommodate and even anticipate all needs. During the Covid delta surge they even provided several hand sanitizers without us even asking. Lastly, the venue provided certain amenities that we didn't anticipate such as someone to watch the elevators to make sure there were no crasher. In regards to staff, we worked with Jenevieve, the venue coordinator. She was nothing short of exceptional. We quickly felt that she was invested in our wedding day after the first visit and our future communications. She was able to negotiate concessions or arrangements between us and the hotel and was flexible when we needed something. She was also very knowledgeable and was able to walk a fine line of making suggestions without being overwhelming or narrowing options when there's too many to choose from. The only negatives of the Westin St. Francis was the parking situation and the price, both of which are a product of having a wedding in downtown San Francisco. Otherwise, I don't regret choosing them. Thanks for everything!

My five star rating is purely for Jenevieve who handles all events at The Westin. She was amazing from the first time we toured the venue with her and fell in love with the views, ...

to quickly responding to emails, and making me feel at ease day-of when my wedding planner fell short. The overall set-up was lovely, the food selections were all delicious, and the wait staff during the wedding were all nice. My only complaints were with the front desk staff and them being unorganized, grouchy, and not helpful. In terms of everything wedding related, Jenevieve made everything so easy and fun for us! She knew all the right questions to ask when we were deciding on linens, meals, and packages. The chef even made a special dim sum cart for our late night bites! Yum! You truly can't beat the views on the 32nd floor and the updated space is a dream!

Many of our guests shared with us that they really enjoyed the food, especially the desserts. Working with Jenevieve throughout this whole process was wonderful. She was very understanding if we made last minute changes, very good at navigating our families, and had lots of suggestions if we asked for advice. She also was very responsive, and very kind on the day of the wedding. She even dropped off a little surprise and sweet card in our suite at the end of the night. If you want an unbelievable venue with kind, supportive staff, I highly recommend the Westin!

ony and another gorgeous space for a reception afterwards. We had our ceremony in the St. Francis Suite and our reception at the Mission Bay Room. The Mission Bay Room was recently renovated, so the space is gorgeous and more modern in design. You don’t need to add much décor to the room itself. We had about 60 guests, which was a perfect guest count for the room. The views are absolutely amazing too since it’s on the 32nd floor. We worked with the On-Site Wedding Coordinator, Jenevieve. We had a fantastic time working with Jenevieve! She was attentive, detail-oriented, and responded to all our questions/concerns very promptly. On several occasions, we exchanged emails at least 3-4x/day. She also provided us with several vendor recommendations, which saved us a lot of time and stress with the planning process! Please note, the venue does require you hire a day of coordinator for the wedding day, which will add at least $2K to your budget. While at the hotel, we were provided with a beautiful bridal suite, which was a nice perk of planning an event at the Westin. The room is spacious, has great lighting for make up and photographs, and also had fantastic views of the city! All in all, our guests loved the venue and enjoyed their dinner as well as the desserts! We couldn’t be happier to have celebrated our big day at the Westin!

We had our wedding and reception at the St. Francis Hotel in smaller rooms: the Borgia room and the St. Francis suite. Originally we had planned to have ~120+ guests, but after w...

e fell in love with these two rooms, we decided to have 70 guests. (We hosted a wedding cocktail celebration a month later for those we could not invite to the wedding.) We loved the old world, turn of the century details of the rooms we chose and it was very intimate and special. The food was excellent, as was the service on the day of the wedding. One star removed due to the turnover in the Sales Department. I had to deal with 3 different people and much information was lost with each handoff, so I had to stay on top of all the details, and double and triple check everything. Managing them before the day of the event was time consuming and not something I anticipated.

Bear with me as I ramble off the cuff... Searching for a venue in SF can be stressful, but the minute that we met Lauren and saw the amazing venue at the top of the Westin we were blown away. We looked at a handful of venues, but there was not one that topped the Westin (Presidio, Fairmont, Intercontinental, deYoung, Legion of Honor). The top floor view of SF + Lauren = a must book venue. From the minute that we signed our contract to winding down our unreal wedding reception, Lauren was over the top impressive. We felt so special getting married there. Everything was handled perfectly, she gives amazing feedback and helps guide you through the whole process. There are a TON of things that go into planning a wedding (as you already know or will find out quickly) and Lauren made everything seamless and straightforward. She guided us towards amazing vendors for photo, DJ, cake, video, lights, etc and we couldn't have been happier with our choices (Jasmine Wang - Photog, Sound in Motion - DJ, Elegant Cheesecakes - cake). Lauren spends a ton of time getting to know you to make sure everything is perfect. We met a handful of times over the months we planned our wedding (yes months...I think it was 3 or 4 total) and every meeting she kept us on track and made sure we were making progress. There is no need for a wedding planner when you book the Westin. The food at the Westin is amazing. You will have a blast doing the wedding food tasting. Our friends and family said it was some of the best food they have ever had at a wedding (MASSIVE KUDOS TO THE CHEF!). The specialty bride and groom cocktails were a big hit as well. The rooms for your guests are amazing and the bridal suite was HUGE. A lot of our guests were out of towners and they absolutely loved the hotel. It's truly the perfect place in SF for visitors. They have all the action right in front of them and can easily get to all other areas. When you pick somewhere like the Fairmont, it's a little more difficult as you have to navigate up and down hills! On the day of the wedding, Lauren goes above and beyond. We did not worry about a single thing. She directs everyone and keeps you on a schedule, which is helpful bc time becomes a blur. She set up the reception and cocktail area perfectly with all of our frames, vases, etc and packed them all up at the end of the night so we did not have to worry about it. The entire Westin staff is first class. The front desk, bell hops, concierge, servers at the Reception, bartenders, etc all were amazing. They make you and your entire wedding group feel special. I could seriously go on and on about Lauren and the impeccable white glove service she provides + the amazing staff + beautiful views of the Westin. Before you finalize your wedding venue search, go see Lauren and the Westin...you won't regret it!!!

We recently had our wedding at the Westin St. Francis in San Francisco. What an amazing event! We were thrilled with the Westin, across the board, and we especially appreciate the ...

amazing, professional and over the top efforts of our wedding coordinator Lauren Schardt. I can't imagine anone is better at the job of wedding coordinator than Lauren, after having gone through this process with her. We had our reception in Victors/Alexandra's on the 32nd floor of the tower and it was amazing! The view is so incredible from up there. All of our guests remarked on how beautiful the room and the view was. Also, we got great reviews from our guests on the food! We had a tasting and during the tasting the chef tweaked one of their standard salads to come up with something we liked better, and it was a big hit! The beef and chicken saltimbocca choices were awesome as well. Sirloin beef tips were my favorite of the appetizers (thank you Lauren for saving a plate for myself and my Bride). One thing we did which was a bit out of the ordinary was we asked for a few antipasto plates for each of the tables when people first came in to sit down. I've heard many remarks from our guests about how much the loved the antipasto! Not only because everyone was pretty hungry by that point. But also because of how bountiful the plate of antipasto was. Really full with some nice meats and cheese, etc. I just can't say enough about how positive our experience was, all the way through the planning to the event itself. Lauren really lead the charge, and guided us along the way. The wait staff and service folks at the hotel and reception were amazing as well. Everyone is raving about our wedding, and for us it will always be such an awesome memory. What a setting and what a night. Thanks to Lauren and the Westin for a fantastic event!

impeccable, and this was noticed by almost all of my 300 guests. The night moved smoothly thanks to Lauren and her team, and, if there was a hiccup, I don't even know about it now. The Westin St. Francis offered me a large enough ballroom for my wedding without feeling like I was in a conference room. It had a very classic San Francisco feel to it and is a timeless setting. I would highly recommend Lauren and her team at The Westin St. Francis to any bride and groom who are looking for a wedding site!

d and I were so impressed with everything they did and helped with. Lauren was absolutely amazing, she had everything ready for us and knew exactly what needed to be done before we knew. She was with us through the whole process. We don't know what we would have done without her. We can't express how much she helped us. She was involved with everything down to our timeline, schedule, photos, meals and rehearsal dinner/rehearsal, as well as our ceremony & reception. Everything went off without a hitch with her assistance. She was great to work with, very responsive, personable & friendly. Anytime we had a question or concern she would address it right away. Leading up to the wedding she was fantastic, following up with us to make sure everything was going well with the planning and keeping us updated & giving us recommendations. She helped us execute our dream wedding. We would highly recommend her and Westin St Francis to host any event or your wedding. The hotel and hotel staff was absolutely amazing, the food was delicious. We also hosted our rehearsal dinner at the hotel and everyone was raving about the food. The staff was so nice and professional. She provided our vendors loading/unloading instructions and kept in constant communication with our wedding coordinator. On the wedding day- she was so great, making sure everything went smoothly. The hotel provided a meal tasting- all of their selections are so good! They have a seasonal menu so the food is very fresh, elegant and filling. No one went home hungry from our wedding. We held our wedding ceremony in Victor's Palace and our reception in Alexandra's Ballroom. They were beautiful and the team did a great job setting up the room to accommodate all of our guests- some handicap. Our photos also turned our amazing in this venue!

nce we began planning, she was always quick to respond to our emails and very helpful in the planning process. I think she really enjoys seeing people's weddings come together and contributed to making our day feel special. The St. Francis Suite itself is a gorgeous venue, with wood panelling, a beautiful ceiling, and nice accents throughout. Very classy and with a character all its own. The smaller rooms attached to the main room provided plenty of space for the cocktail hour, bar, favors, etc., so a very practical space. The cake vendors had to be chosen from a list of three, but they all looked pretty good and we were really happy with the one we picked. On the day of, all the setup went very smoothly and they were helpful and accommodating with the little details (all those little things you have to remember to bring on the day of!). The tables and decor provided also all looked great, including the small things like the cake stand and table ware. The hotel-provided catering lived up to the classy atmosphere of the venue. The tasting allowed us to try the wines and a few of the food options. We didn't get to try the appetizers, or pick exactly which desserts, but those were all amazing so I wouldn't sweat it. Our only complaint was the chicken dish we picked wasn't quite as crispy as it was during the tasting. It was still very good and no guests complained, but I guess it is hard to get the dishes to come out *exactly* like the tasting when they need to serve up 50+ of them. Something to keep in mind. Also, one night in one of the signature suites was included. We opted to add one night before the event too, which was great because we were able to bring all the things we needed a whole day early. We even had makeup and hair done in the suite. This was a big plus for us, and it didn't cost too much extra. The suite itself is really huge, large enough to host a small event on its own. Very convenient!

From the start, their event coordinator, Lauren Schardt, made us feel like we were in good hands. She guided us at every step and made sure to answer every question. We used their preferred vendors (Poppy's Petalworks for flowers and Elegant Cheesecakes for cake) and it made things very easy to plan and coordinate. We had many guests coming from out of town and Lauren made sure everyone got our welcome bags and had a great stay. By the time the big day arrived, I knew the day would be great because Lauren was taking care of everything. The reception was beyond anything I could have imagined. It's almost like a dream. The 32nd Floor is a magical and impressive space and made sure it was a wedding none of our guests would forget. From the food, to the wine, to the service, to the late night ice cream station... everything was perfect. Thank you to the Westin and Lauren for making my wedding amazing.

We had our wedding reception at the Westin St Francis last month and it was amazing! We got engaged at the WSF so it only seemed fitting to have our wedding reception there, too. ...

We are in Los Angeles so, I thought it would be challenging. Well, enter Lauren Schardt, expert wedding specialist at the Westin St. Francis - from our first meeting 7 months prior to our big day, we were in great hands. Lauren walked us through the rooms that made sense for the number of guests we would have. Suggesting layout ideas and what would work for having dining, dancing and a Jazz Band. She guided us through the event packages, the menu tastings, and she accommodated our changes. We never felt lost as we were in communication throughout the entire planning process. We visited San Francisco three times during our planning, and each time Lauren met with us to go over details, details, details. I could go on and on about how great Lauren is – room upgrades, treats in our rooms, assistance and suggestions, all the way down to bringing us – the bride and groom- hors d'oeuvres and cocktails (Hendrick’s Martinis which she had to arrange from the bar 31 floors down), while we waited to make our grand entrance. Wonderful! Victor’s Palace on the 32nd floor was the room we chose for our reception. Floor to ceiling windows – amazing views day and night. Thank you Lauren- Everything went off without a hitch! The room was set up beautifully. The food was delicious and the service was perfect. We had the BEST time because we didn’t have to worry about anything. We laughed, we danced, and we had cake. What a beautiful day! Anyone who has ever been to the Westin St. Francis already knows it’s a beautiful, grand hotel and the customer service is second to none. People like Lauren are who make exceptional hospitality. You see smiling, helpful faces everywhere at the WSF. Since having two major life events happen there- getting engaged and having my wedding reception there- I’m happy to say the Westin St. Francis is part of my life story. I don’t want to stay at any other hotel when I visit San Francisco.

My (now) wife and I knew we wanted to get married in San Francisco, as this is the place we call our home and the city we love. The Westin St. Francis was the first venue we looked...

at, but we wanted to look at other venues (so we looked in Napa, Carmel, a couple of other hotels including the Fairmont, and the Ferry Building). At the end of it all, we ended up deciding that the Westin St. Francis would be perfect because: 1) it was in San Francisco; 2) we really enjoyed meeting and interacting with Lauren, the wedding coordinator, and just had a good feeling; 3) the venue is beautiful and the Imperial Floor had some of the best views around and the decor and style were just so classic and beautiful; and 4) we're both extremely busy individuals and having a wedding package would make things so much less stressful for us. From day 1, Lauren provided us with so much support and was attentive to every single one of our needs. The hotel was easy to work with and accommodated pretty much all of our reasonable requests, making sure we were happy. There was regular follow-up and communication - I'm not sure if we had more questions than other couples but I know we certainly had quite a few - and all questions were answered promptly and re-assured us that we had made the right choice. The food tasting was a lot of fun, and Lauren/the chefs gave us an amazing tasting. All of the food was so great and so well prepared. Everyone says to remember to eat during the wedding - well, we knew we had to make sure we ate the food just because it was so good. The suite we were given for the weekend was amazing, with incredible views and impeccable service. Also, the fact that they accommodated our dog during the ceremony and with a bed, dish, and treats was so thoughtful, and we were definitely glad we had our dog there with us during the festivities. The wedding itself - it was incredible. The room and setup looked more incredible than either of us could have imagined. The colors, windows, furniture - everything was perfect. Lauren and the entire staff worked really hard to ensure that the whole night ran without a hitch, and really, nothing went wrong. The staff was attentive, nobody was left wanting for drinks or food or whatever, and we didn't have to worry about taking care of anything at all. Even now, over a month after the wedding, our friends and family are still telling us about how incredible the wedding was and how it was "the wedding of the year". Obviously, they could just be saying that, but I definitely believe it when they say that, especially when we have that many people saying it. This really was our perfect wedding and the best way to start off the rest of our lives. Once again, Lauren, her staff, and the Westin St. Francis have our gratitude for all that they did to help make that most special of days such a lasting memory.

th Lauren Schardt. Lauren helped us create and execute a perfect, flawless wedding. She worked with us throughout the process and it was a great pleasure – she was fun to be around, extremely cool and logical and helped us make some otherwise emotional decisions as wedding decisions tend to be. She has infallible patience, as we flip-flopped between decisions, asked for changes to event order proposals, etc. Our guests had an incredible time, and much of the reason for this lies in Lauren’s ability to make things happen for us. She consistently went above and beyond for us and made things happen that we didn’t think were possible. For example: \- She helped us extend our room block to not only include Saturday and Sunday nights but also Thursday and Friday as many people were coming from out of town. \- She helped get reservations moved into the room block for guests who booked too late. \- She helped us get use of not only Alexandra’s but also Victor’s for the cocktail reception following the ceremony. \- She put together a Friday night cocktail welcome reception in the Olympic Room after so much back and forth with us – if it were me I would have gone mad! – and made special arrangements to accommodate my family’s desire to provide a large block of English Stilton cheese (a family tradition) \- She organized a breakfast on Sunday in Victor’s – the event order for which we changed at the last possible minute! \- I had flowers delivered to her for the wedding suite and she laid them out as I requested on the night of the wedding \- She even helped us put together our dream honeymoon at various other Starwood properties! I could go on… Our wedding was perfect, and the execution by Lauren and team at the Westin St Francis was flawless. After over a year of working with Lauren and team, my wife and I don’t have post-wedding blues. But we will be sad to not have the opportunity to speak with Lauren on a regular basis!

If you are going to be getting married in San Francisco, why not see all its beauty from the top floor with surrounding windows of the Golden Gate, Coit Tower, and much more! Although the hotel rooms are amazing, the venue is gorgeous, sometimes that means nothing without good service. The Westin St. Francis is the leading example of what exemplary service is. From the valet to housekeeping...all supporting members were overly gracious to my loved ones visiting. However, I want to make a BIG shout out to Lauren Schardt. She was by far, the best support for my entire wedding. When I needed something she was there. Out of all the stories I heard after the big day, Lauren's name was always mentioned. She is one of those amazing people you find once in a blue moon, where you know she is taking her responsibilities a step beyond and making sure your special day is more than you dreamed.

Her can-do, positive attitude made her a pleasure to plan with. She made us feel very well taken care of, and like we didn't have to worry about a thing. Planning at the Westin was so much easier than it felt like it would be at other venues since so many details are already taken care of by the hotel. I can't forget to mention how amazing the food was! Lauren worked with the chef to come up with a menu that reflected our taste, and we loved every bite!

Lauren Schardt is a super star. The End. Seriously, she is the reason that we ultimately chose The Westin St. Francis and she did not let us down. And she is not alone there...

in the hospitality and professionalism department. Everyone from the Executive Chef, to the servers and bartenders performed expertly and delivered with a smile. It was an incredible thing to watch…and enjoy. Our short list for choice of venue was; The Palace Hotel, The Westin St. Francis, and V. Sattui Winery. All three are amazing venues, each with their strengths. But only one of these gave us the warm welcome on first meeting, and only one kept coming through with reasons to choose them. After choosing Lauren, she continued to impress us with her organization, flexibility with options, and overall cheery positive attitude. She made us feel like everything is under control, and we had nothing to worry about. She was always very responsive to emails and phone calls. She also let us make late changes to our food and drink packages. Very late in the planning phase I decided that I didn’t like the bar package that we had chosen earlier. No problem…Lauren made all the changes without affecting our budget. On Wedding Day, Lauren was calmly in control. She even helped us relax with her infectious smile and sense of humor. She made sure our guests were seated on time, and that all the pieces were in place. Once we made it to the reception, the table service was flawless and the food was top tier delicious. We dine a lot in San Francisco, and I can assure you that the quality of the food prepared at The Westin St. Francis is right in line with 5-star restaurants. I highly recommend this amazing hotel, Lauren Schardt and her entire catering staff.

our engagement. On our initial visit, she laid out all of our options for us, but didn't try to push any one package on us. She understood our budget constraints and helped inform us accordingly. While we instantly fell in love with the view and the Imperial Floor, we still wanted to check out other venues that might be more cost effective. As promised, Lauren continually checked in with us over several weeks and months, not pressuring us to make a decision, but kindly checking to see if we had any other questions. After a few more visits to the hotel and some package tweaking, we decided to sign the contract. We knew we would be in good hands with Lauren. During the months leading up to the wedding, Lauren was immensely helpful in ensuring our event was a success. She was always professional, responsive, calm, and supportive throughout the process. During the menu tasting, she patiently listened to our likes and dislikes and helped make recommendations to adjust items to our preferences. She was also thoughtful with little details and added touches here and there, especially during the wedding week. The bottom line is Lauren really took care of us for a whole year, from the moment we first visited the venue to after the big event. We had a gorgeous, unforgettable wedding and couldn't have asked for a better venue. The overall execution, the package options, the view, and all the little touches made our wedding day perfect.

l Borgia room, and the reception was up in Alexandra's ballroom on the 32nd floor of the new tower. Gorgeous! We had about exactly 100 people and both venues felt like the perfect size. In addition to the truly beautiful venue, the other huge "plus" of having our wedding at the Westin St. Francis was Lauren Schardt, the hotel's wedding specialist. We worked with her from initial contract through our day-after brunch, and she's stellar. She's a wedding expert! Very patient, very service-oriented, and very very helpful. She is a calm and collected presence throughout the wedding planning process, and she enabled our event to go off without a hitch. With Lauren, and the various amenities provided by the hotel (i.e., you do not need to work with a bunch of vendors because catering, beverages, etc., are through the hotel) a wedding planner is not necessary. The only other vendors we needed to work with were the DJ, florist, and cake-maker. Highly recommend the Westin St. Francis, and thank-you Lauren for helping to make our wedding day such a dream! Best day of our lives :)

and were dark and stuffy; it is like they put you in a pretty basement with chandlers. I wanted windows and the Westin St. Francis delivered. The venue is on the top floor of the hotel, with floor to ceiling windows. The place is so beautiful, you do not have to overboard with flowers and additional decor, it was already impressive.The views are amazing! If you look at everything as a cost per person, it looks really expensive. But everything is included. The room rental is included in the cost per person amount. So it averaged out to be fair (in my eyes). If you look at the average cost of a wedding in the bay area, it is not the highest, if you don't go overboard on flowers and other things, its works. Also, the hotel supplied us with the most amazing coordinator ever, Lauren. I was so worried that I needed my own wedding coordinator for my wedding, but Lauren helped us with a lot. She even buttoned up my dress (my mom forgot) so I could dance. She is on point, I couldn't ask for anyone better. The wedding ran smoothly, so I wasn't so stressed out. She gave great advise too, and let my husband and I know what is typical and what is not (we were not wedding experts. Anyways, the ceremony and venue was well worth the money. I would totally recommend 100% to people who want to get married.

Having our reception at the Westin St. Francis was the best decision my husband and I could have done. First of all, the staff is AMAZING! Lauren and her team went above an beyond ...

for us. Everything went as planned and everything was perfectly in place. Cocktail hour in Victor's was great. The food was customized to what we wanted and everyone loved it. We were very lucky, it was cloudless day in the city and the views were gorgeous!! Alexandra's was set-up perfectly, the room was perfect for our wedding with the gold accents. I would highly recommend having your wedding at the Westin St. Francis. I can't stress how beautiful the wedding was and how helpful the staff is. Everything we wanted, they gave us, with a smile on their face. The planning process was a great learning experience and Lauren had everything organized to the "T". Get married here,its totally worth it!! Happy Wedding Day!! :)

The Westin St. Francis Hotel exceed my dreams of my perfect wedding. From our first meeting with Lauren Schardt she did everything in her power to make sure my dream and visions we...

re put to life. At our tasting with the Chef she made custom menus with our names on it. The tasting was amazing we tried so many different options of appetizers, salads, main course and desserts. We spoke with the chef and told him how to make our traditional middle eastern dishes and he exceeded our expectations. He also came up with ideas of making the sweet potatoes in to a heart shape and adding glitter to the desserts. Made for an extra special experience. The staff at the hotel went out of their way to make us feel like Queens and Kings on our wedding day. They also gave 5 star service to all of our guests. I can't say enough about Lauren or the Westin. They truly gave me my dream wedding.

Our daytime reception was held on the Imperial Floor. The stunningly beautiful view of SF is awesome but what really made the experience excellent was the service we received from ...

Lauren Schardt and the staff. Lauren is fantastic and she really put my husband and I at ease when we were planning the reception. All of the staff, from the bellhops to the service staff at the reception, were kind, professional, and on top of all of the details. It was a wonderful event that went so smoothly-thanks to Lauren and the staff at the Westin!

I recently held my wedding reception at the Westin St. Francis, San Francisco. My husband and I were extremely happy with the way everything turned out and would not hesitate to h...

ighly recommend the Westin for future events! Since we wanted to be married in San Francisco, we had many places to choose from for our reception. The Westin turned out to be the best venue for us and the service and the value we received was outstanding! We were fortunate to have Lauren Schardt as our coordinator and she really helped guide us through all the preparation. Lauren was truly a pleasure to work with and we appreciate how helpful, and essential, she was in the decision making and planning process. She was also there at the event to make sure all went smoothly (and it did). The event was held on the 32nd floor of the Tower building and the views were amazing. The beautiful event rooms were accessed by the outside glass elevators. Our cocktail hour was held in Victor’s Palace, a stunning room with view windows and twinkling chandeliers. The dinner and dancing was held at the other end of the hall at the Alexandra’s Ballroom. The décor of the ballroom was “dreamlike” and the floor to ceiling windows showcased the city skyline and beyond. The size was perfect to accommodate our guests for a romantic dinner, a band with a dance floor and two bars. One other advantage of this location was that the “package” included a block of rooms for our guests, at a very fair price and a complimentary suite for us. There were wonderful menu and cake choices and many of our guests commented on how delicious the food was. Once again, I would like to mention how fortunate we were to have had Lauren Schardt as our coordinator. Our reception was even better than we ever could have imagined.

We had our wedding at the Westin St. Francis this past June 2013. We had a rough time selecting a venue. We were trying to keep costs down and I felt like we had looked everywhere ...

with no luck. Finally we stopped in the the Westin St. Francis with no appointment but hoping to have some luck at the end of a long venue searching day. We absolutely fell in love with Victors and Alexanders Palace both on the top floor of the Westin with amazing views of the city. We both new instantly that the Westin was where we were having our wedding. The cost at the Westin was higher then we had wanted to spend but the venue was incomparable to anything else we had seen. I do not regret the money we spent on this amazing venue. We were turned over to (at the time new wedding planner to the Westin) Lauren Schardt. Lauren went above and beyond to make every aspect of our wedding amazing. I was more then impressed with the service at the Westin. I had exchanged countless emails with Lauren in planning and had numerous meetings with her as well. We planned every detail of our wedding from food and tasting to tablecloths and napkins modifying everything to my liking. We had an amazing time at our tasting and picked some of the best food (crab cakes, beef sliders, ahi, halibut, spinach pasta and braised short ribs with prawns) to name a few of my favorites and the Westin also helped us with a speciality drink. The chef was very accommodating with any suggestions we had. Lauren assured me the day would be perfect and the it was beyond my every expectation. She kept me up to date on everything, she was attentive and had all the answers when I had questions. She was also there on the day of making sure the day was flawless and that my husband and I had everything we needed. The day couldn't have gone smoother and couldn't have been more beautiful. I got complements from so many guests on the venue, the food and so many told us how calm we looked which is only because of how confident I was in the Westin. I wish we could have our day over again it was flawless! The best day of my life.

ginal banquet manager left during our wedding planning process, as we really enjoyed working with her and she knew all of the details we had discussed since Day 1. But, Lauren Schardt transitioned seamlessly as our new banquet manager and exceeded our expectations. She was extremely responsive and went above and beyond during the planning process and day of to ensure we had a wonderful time. We didn't have to worry about anything on our wedding day except having a great time. The day was seamless! I highly recommend the Westin St. Francis as a wedding venue. The beautiful venue with stunning views, great food, and their staff's attention to detail made for an unforgettable wedding!

My daughter’s wedding at the Westin St. Francis in San Francisco was beyond magical. The exquisite venue contributed to the fairy tale fantasy, but the most important component was...

the people in the catering and banquet department of the hotel. At every step of the way, what we got was well beyond excellent service; it was a caring and helpfulness that was far in excess of what one would expect, even at such a grand hotel. The venue (Alexandra’s and Victor’s on the 32nd floor) is amazing. There are views of the City and the Bay. But it is even more beautiful when set up for a banquet, with tea candles everywhere gleaming off the exquisite silver, china and glassware. Even the tablecloths and chairs amplify the golden glow that fills the room. It is simply breathtaking. The staff truly wanted our event to be wonderful and stress free. They helped us every step of the way, from planning a date when the city would not be crowded with conventioneers to anticipating that we would need two sets of steps to the riser to provide ample room for the gown. They provided options when possible, with suggestions about what had worked in the past. They accommodated the inclusion of the dog as ringbearer. On the morning of the wedding, when the bride had been feeling sick and wished for Gatorade, there appeared three bottles in different flavors. In short, the staff was there for us, providing suggestions and support all along the way. The food was fantastic. The dinner was sumptuous, like the chef’s tasting menu at a very elegant restaurant. The tasting is so much fun – not only are you presented with an incredible variety of delicious things to choose from, but the chefs come out to explain why they chose each particular combination of flavors. We had both the ceremony and the dining and dancing in Alexandra’s, with cocktails in Victor’s in between. This meant that the staff performed Herculean feats in getting the room rearranged from the ceremony (rows of chairs with a center aisle) to the banquet setting – it was a wonder of planning, organization, skill, and cooperation among so many people. My daughter had her choice of a “bridal suite” for the night before and the wedding night. The one she chose, the State Suite, made a beautiful and elegant background for the “before” wedding pictures. Last, but not least, was the morning-after brunch in the St. Francis Suite, yet another elegant yet comfortable venue for delicious food and relaxation, with a view of Union Square. Because the catering department is so experienced, all charges were included in the initial plan. Thus we were not surprised along the way by any suggestions that we could add things we had not thought of for “extra charges”. Everything we could want was included and explained upfront. This is also a consideration if you compare with some venues that require that you go through the hassle (and cost) of arranging separately for chairs, tablecloths, etc. In short, having the wedding at the Westin St. Francis was a great decision. It was a wonderful event for us, and the staff made it as easy as such a thing could be. I cannot imagine a more romantic and elegant venue, and the people we worked with went above and beyond at every turn. Be sure to go and talk to them when you plan your San Francisco wedding; you will be doing yourself a great disservice if you don’t.
