It's the most wonderful time of the year…to save big on an engagement ring, that is. As you've probably noticed, engagement rings and wedding bands don't exactly come with low price tags. But we'll let you in on a little secret: Cyber Monday and [Black Friday](https://www.theknot.com/content/brides-guide-black-friday-sales) engagement ring sales are 100% a thing, so the best time to buy your proposal piece or a band for your ring stack is _right now_.

The truth is that jewelry sales like these rarely happen. Diamonds, gemstones and precious metals are priced the way they are for a reason, so retailers don't typically slash their costs throughout the year. That said, many of our favorite brands are delivering massive Black Friday engagement ring sales in 2025, meaning there's no better time to start shopping for the perfect piece at a fraction of the usual price. (Psst: This means you can save hundreds, if not thousands, on your milestone purchase.) Engagement rings aren't the only jewelry on sale this holiday season either, because plenty of Black Friday wedding ring deals are available as well.

## Do Engagement Rings Go on Sale for Black Friday?

We know what you're thinking: Do engagement rings really go on sale for Black Friday or Cyber Monday? The thought may sound too good to be true, but in recent years, more retailers have begun offering major deals on engagement rings and wedding bands. "If you are planning to propose, then Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales are absolutely worth it," says Lorraine Brantner, Sales Manager and Gemologist at James Allen. "You're able to maximize your budget by taking advantage of the best discounts without sacrificing quality."

Unlike sales on tech or fashion, though, you won't see massive reductions in ring prices. Diamonds, gemstones and precious metals are still incredibly valuable materials, after all, so most Black Friday engagement ring sales will range from 10% to 30% off, or they may include a discount on the setting, free shipping or a gift with your purchase. Below, we share a few expert tips to keep in mind when shopping Black Friday and Cyber Monday engagement ring sales to ensure your purchase is trustworthy and legitimate.

## How to Shop Cyber Monday and Black Friday Engagement Ring Sales

![Black Friday engagement ring sale shopping tips](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/bd9f0f5c-ed42-4e94-98bb-a1547a1e9f2d~rs_768.h-cr_38.0.1163.1500)

With so many incredible sales highlighted above, you'd be remiss not to take advantage of [wedding discounts](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-discounts) this rare. That said, it is crucial to do your research ahead of time to make sure an engagement ring or wedding band sale is the real deal. To help you make an informed (and legitimate) purchase, here are a few trustworthy tips for shopping Black Friday or Cyber Monday sales on engagement rings.

### Set a Budget

First and foremost, you can't shop a Black Friday engagement ring sale without setting a budget. According to The Knot's data, the [average cost of an engagement ring](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-much-to-spend-on-engagement-ring) right now is $5,200. Since this number represents the national average, it can simply be used as a guideline for your purchase. Your engagement ring (and subsequent wedding band) budget is a personal decision between you and your partner, and should be determined based on what comfortably fits your current financial situation.

### Consider Production Time

When shopping for engagement and wedding rings on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, it's important to consider the customization and lead times associated with fine jewelry. Although Black Friday falls in the middle of [engagement season](https://www.theknot.com/content/things-to-know-for-proposal-season), you might not receive your ring for a few weeks, so plan your proposal timeline accordingly. "Fine jewelry is often bespoke and made to order. Shoppers will want to keep that in mind if they're shopping Black Friday deals in hopes of having it in time for holiday gifting," says Jillian Sassone, founder of Marrow Fine.

If you have a specific timeline in mind, don't panic; there are plenty of options. "Many designers have a 'ready to ship' section that you can shop if you want to make sure to have it in plenty of time to make someone's holiday extra special," she adds.

### Do Your Ring Research

When it comes to shopping for engagement and wedding rings on Black Friday or Cyber Monday, Sassone recommends doing your homework beforehand, whether you're shopping online or in person. This includes having a clear idea of what you're looking for. Get familiar with specific characteristics that matter to you, such as the [metal color](https://www.theknot.com/content/engagement-ring-metal-types), the [center stone shape](https://www.theknot.com/content/brilliant-tips-how-to-choose-a-diamond-shape) or special details, like side stones or halos. "It's easy to get caught up in the frenzy or pull the trigger on what seems like a good deal, but setting aside time to educate yourself beforehand will absolutely set you up for success," Sassone says. A virtual or in-person consultation will allow you to ask questions and gain valuable insights into the design process and customization options.

### Shop With Jewelers You Trust

We recommend shopping with brands that have great reviews from real clients, which can help verify that your online purchase will be worth the investment. Your chosen company should also offer documentation that confirms your diamond or gemstone is legitimate. "Ensure that your retailer provides you with the appropriate reports and appraisals to confirm that your diamond has been properly evaluated," says Sean Kell, CEO of Blue Nile. "For example, all engagement rings purchased from Blue Nile include a grading report from the Gemological Institute of America (GIA), which serves as a grading system for the jewelry industry, along with an appraisal that states the value of the piece compared to relevant market data. Customer reviews also serve as another source of confidence when making a purchase decision."

Brantner also recommends shopping a Black Friday engagement ring sale from a retailer that offers flexible customer service after your purchase. "Make sure you have the option to return or exchange your purchase within a reasonable timeframe," she suggests. "Also, ask about after-sale services such as resizes and repairs."

### Take Advantage of Customer Service Help

While some Black Friday engagement ring deals are available in-store, most Cyber Monday jewelry sales can be shopped from the comfort of home. But if the thought of [buying an engagement ring online](https://www.theknot.com/content/should-you-buy-your-engagement-ring-online) feels overwhelming, don't stress. Virtual jewelry shopping is becoming more common as brands develop revolutionary technology to enhance the digital browsing experience.

Most online retailers offer 24/7 access to jewelers and agents equipped to help you through your purchase. That means you can instantly connect with experts to ask questions and get help finding the ring *without* missing out on the best details. "It is important that customers feel comfortable not only with the jewelry selections, but also with the people who are assisting you with your purchase," Brantner says, emphasizing the importance of shopping a Black Friday engagement ring sale from a retailer you trust.
