Esther Lee is Editorial Director at The Knot. She leads and manages The Knot Editors across both print and digital. A New Yorker with a tireless appetite for adventure, she enjoys traveling to awe-inducing destinations (to inspire your destination weddings and honeymoons, of course). She feels that one of the greatest aspects of being a wedding editor for nearly a decade has been learning more about the industry, and the creative forces who shape how we celebrate.

## Experience

Esther joined the wedding industry in 2016 as the Senior News Editor of The Knot, where she built the News division of the brand. She has penned, managed, and spearheaded everything from brand activations, like The Knot's partnership with  _Crazy Rich Asians_ , and the 2018 Royal Wedding. A reporter at heart, she enjoys picking the minds of the industry's finest while storytelling across the most pertinent topics impacting couples and wedding professionals at any given moment.   


Prior to her decade of experience as a wedding editor, Esther diligently nurtured her expertise in the entertainment and lifestyle industries, first at the _Philadelphia Inquirer_ ’s digital properties, where she trained under Pulitzer Prize-winning journalists and staffers who taught her the foundational elements of journalism. That role was then followed by a fast-paced, three-year stint at _Us Weekly_ , where she served as a staff editor, thriving most during breaking news beats and awards seasons. A master interviewer with an innate curiosity, Esther has published interviews and built a rapport with some of the most admired and accomplished names of our time. 

## Education

Esther holds a B.A. in International Politics with a concentration in History from the Pennsylvania State University, where she was an active member of THON, sat on the Homecoming Committee, and had an illustrious study abroad experience focused on English Literature.

## Awards & Associations

Esther has been quoted across dozens of media outlets, most notably  _[CBS This Morning](https://www.cbsnews.com/video/how-to-save-money-on-weddings-amid-rising-costs-inflation/)_ , [ _Today_ Show](https://www.today.com/money/wedding-budget-save-money-these-expert-tips-t234142),  _Wall Street Journal,_  _[Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-10/wedding-etiquette-during-the-pandemic-to-attend-or-not), [Yahoo! Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/wedding-expert-predicts-huge-massive-205625208.html),_ and more. She frequently moderates panels and appears on podcasts to discuss everything from stationery to the future of weddings. As such, Esther is a trusted wedding editor and expert in the wedding industry, driven by her desire to help businesses and couples throw beautiful, memorable occasions that last a lifetime. 

## Important Questions from The Knot

### What’s your all-time favorite wedding song?

This one is an ever-evolving target. However and as a New Yorker myself, I must say “New York, New York,” especially if it’s played among besties based in New York, New York. 

### Dream celebrity wedding guest?

As a BLINK (a devoted fan of Blackpink) and a BTS fan, I ask that we please get either (preferably both) to my nuptials for one song. Also, my dog Pado, because he is a celebrity in my heart.

### Best wedding after-party snack?

I believe the best snacks are reserved for the next morning. (Think bagels from Sadelle's or take-home cookies from Milk Bar.)
