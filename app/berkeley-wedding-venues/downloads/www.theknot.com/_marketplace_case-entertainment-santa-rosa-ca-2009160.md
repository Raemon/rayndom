l available and worked with us on all of our date changes and even when we added hours he honored his 2019 prices. We had lots of songs and music cues during our Hindu ceremony, but he did a really great job and was ready with every music cue the pundit gave him. I highly recommend James!

James offered so many options for his services and we got to choose what worked best for us which even included a monogram for the reception area and a smoke machine for first dance. We went all out on our wedding and so did James!

I had to get a DJ sort of last minute due to my previous one canceling on me. I found James Case via Yelp, and I’m SO happy I did! He showed up a few hours early to set up. Very pr...

ofessional, polite, clean cut guy. He played music specified to mine and my grooms taste. When he announced the names for our wedding party, he made it very fun & upbeat. He knows how to throw down a party!! He made 06/08/2019 the best day we’ve ever had & I would recommend him to everyone I know. And If I ever need DJ services again in the future, I will MOST DEFINITELY be using him!

the wedding. He played the music I asked for and even helped me with a custom song line up for a special performance I had planned for the Garter toss. We went over exactly what songs and when to play them during the wedding, the order of speeches, and he left nothing to chance. I would highly recommend him and his company, plus his prices are better than the other options in the area without the BS I got from some of the other guys! Thanks James it was one hell of a wedding and you helped make that happen!!
