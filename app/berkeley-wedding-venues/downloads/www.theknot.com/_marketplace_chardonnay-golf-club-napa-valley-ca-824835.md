WEDDING DATE 10/4/25: We have attempted to have a meeting with Fairview Chardonnay for over three weeks to address our concerns. Here is the email that we sent to the team after th...

ey solicited reviews from us: Key Issues: Incomplete Setup Upon Guest Arrival: The ceremony and reception areas were not fully decorated or arranged when guests arrived. The drapes on the arch and reception tables were not set, and key décor was missing from the ceremony space, cocktail area, and reception tent. Our photographer, usher, and matron of honor had to actively assist with the setup to avoid further delays and disruptions. Guests were redirected to the golf club bar. This led to confusion and guests wandering the premises, and attempting to enter the bridal suite, where the bride was. Staff Coordination & Communication Failures: Our photographer was harassed by venue staff when she tried to assist in arranging table décor for pre-event photos. They mocked her and laughed at her. I could not reach anyone for the promised golf cart shuttle from bridal suite to groom’s suite. Calls and texts went unanswered.Upon arrival, the bridal party and I could not locate our bouquets. Décor from another wedding was left in the guest bathroom. Catering & Beverage Service Issues: The dinner buffet was not ready on time (7:00 p.m.), causing a noticeable delay and leaving guests waiting awkwardly at their tables after the toasts. The bar ran out of water, and I was told soda water was the only available option. No one offered to restock or replenish the water station. Multiple guests brought up their search for WATER after the water dispenser was empty. Guests asked if we did something to piss off the bar staff and made comments such as "the bar staff seems miserable to be here." This lack of professionalism is abysmal. Despite repeated planning discussions and written communication, my matron of honor was served a vegetarian meal instead of a gluten-free one. Multiple family members and eventually I had to speak to staff directly to ensure she received a proper meal. At EVERY planning meeting, I specifically brought up the gluten allergy. Each time I was told they would "talk to chef." I made it very clear that my sister having peace of mind about the meal was a crucial factor in my wedding day experience. Package Inclusions Not Delivered: Yard games (cornhole, putting green) included in the Elite Package were never set out for cocktail hour, despite having been discussed and promised. Reception & Post-Event Issues: Cake cutting was poorly executed and appeared sloppy — several guests thought the slices looked half-eaten. The welcome table was left outside; guests and family had to bring it into the tent themselves. Guests and family took down and boxed decor at the end of the night, with no support from venue staff. The top tier of our wedding cake was not offered or given to us. I had to search the kitchen myself at the end of the evening. Each of these points in isolation may seem like a misstep. Taken together, they reflect a serious breakdown in service and communication. As paying clients who selected a premium package and clearly communicated expectations in every planning meeting, we are incredibly disappointed in how things were handled.

rom our initial phone call, to meeting her and seeing the venue, and until the end of our wedding, Lea was genuine, kind, and has the can-do attitude. My husband and I couldn't have imagined a better wedding. Lea and her team has such a positive energy and that's exactly what you need especially when planning a wedding. Our guests complimented the beautiful venue and all the details that went into it. So thank you, Fairview Chardonnay team and preferred vendors!

I got married at Chardonnay on Sept 10, 2021. We had our reception in the tent due to our guest size of 300. The weeks leading up to our wedding we were told that the wedding plann...

er Noy was no longer employed there. We were given another representative to help, but this was right before the wedding! The week of our wedding they asked us if we’d be willing to change our plans from a seated dinner to buffet. I refused. The day of the wedding they were understaffed as they had another wedding taking place in the ballroom. My guests were the ones who suffered. Even though we took the time asking for meal selections, printing meal cards and assigning them to seats, my guests were not served what they order, or were served their food cold. My grandmother, the only living grandparent for both my husband and I, was served her food last! A family member of mine had to go to the kitchen to request her food because they forgot! We paid for bar service and the idea was to open the bar side of the tent during cocktail hour. Well, the bar side of the tent wouldn’t open. They had to break it (in front of my guests), in order to open it. Additionally, our guests were being charged for drinks even though we paid for soft drinks/ water in full and left a substantial amount on the tab for alcohol. We also bought bottles of sparking cider to be passed out to our non-drinking guests and the staff did not even open the bottles. After this experience, I emailed and called countless times asking for a refund for all of the terrible service my guest received. I had a detailed summary of what I felt we were fairly owed. Bob Becker, who was the general manager at the time (not sure if he currently is) responded to me via email stating that he’d reply to me the following day and send over a refund to compensate the mess we were dealt. Bob never replied to me after that initial response I received from him. This was our wedding day. We were so embarrassed to hear about the experience our guests had. They say all your guests remember after your wedding is the food and music. Well all of mine remembered the terrible food! We received feedback because our guests felt it was unfair that we paid what we did and received that kind of service. A wedding is a once in a lifetime event. I spent a year planning our wedding to avoid a situation like this. We paid everything on time and I made sure everything was in place to ensure the day went smoothly. What I could not control was the service and unfortunately we received the worst. I would not recommend Chardonnay Golf Club. It was a slap in our face to never receive a refund for the experience we had, not even the decency of a response. I still am waiting!!!!!!

enue. The wedding I photographed at Chardonnay recently was a perfect example of the terrific events they host. I visited Chardonnay prior to the wedding, and the event staff could not have been more helpful, driving me around in a golf cart to familiarize me with the property, to review the flow of events, and to point out the many picturesque spots available for gorgeous wedding day portraiture. All of the wedding staff members I met were more than happy to spend the time I needed to ensure the couple would receive the best photographs possible without taking too much time away from the celebration. I observed the same attentive service from Chardonnay's staff on the wedding day, seeing a team that was professional, efficient and respectful to all wedding guests and vendors alike. Dinner service was impeccable and flowed seamlessly into the festive reception, which included a spacious dance floor and great sound system that was clearly enjoyed by all. When I spoke with the couple after the wedding, they had nothing but positive accolades about their venue choice. Based on my experiences with Chardonnay Golf Course, I would highly recommend it to everyone considering it for their wine country/golf club weddings or other events.

View Room for reception, CGC made a perfect venue for us! Noy and Melissa worked closely with us throughout the wedding preparation process, providing us with professional advice, organizing the detailed wedding information, and doing everything they can to help accommodate our needs. The communications with Noy and Melissa were always smooth and easy through emails. We were new to the area and their preferred vendor list was such a big help for us — these are all top-notched wedding vendors and we had our amazing wedding team from there! The view and landscape are stunning at the venue, creating a lot of photography opportunities. The food options are impressive and the quality is superb! We got a lot of compliments from our guests. Noy and Melissa are sweet, caring and amazing to work with. Really happy that we had CGC as our wedding venue and would definitely recommend!

We also had a private menu tasting in April where we were able to taste several of the high quality options for the appetizers, entrees, and desserts, and the food on the wedding day was just as good (the steak is huge!). On the wedding day, the staff were attentive and helpful, including driving us around on a golf cart for photos and bringing great energy to the wedding! We would definitely recommend this venue for its fantastic service, great scenery, and fairly priced package.

We had survey Napa and Sonoma area, but Chardonnay Golf Club is The best decision and when we was meeting with Noy as our wedding assistant is very impressive . She has a personality that is calming, sweet and above all wants the best for you. She is such a delight to work with. Melissa, was such a nice person too. We first met Melissa at our food tasting and from then on we loved her. Both these women are there for you. Quick responses always from email or phone and are flexible with anything you need. I truly could not speak more highly about their service but the people they are. One month later From Our wedding, we still receive compliments from friends and relatives and although there were some minor problem on the day, but that was still acceptable. I'm super satisfied When pick Chardonnay for my wedding. (The ceremony dome, wine barrels, the super gorgeous tent with chandelier and how effortlessly the evening flowed, chairs, glassware, delicious food, table linens, etc) Could not go wrong with hiring Chardonnay Golf Club to help create your dream wedding. We would definitely recommend Chardonnay Golf Club to anyone who is looking for a venue outdoors in the Napa Valley.. Thank you Noy, for a memorable and lovely experience for the best day in my life..

use of the amazing experience we had. The location, the service, the leadership and kindness that Noy provided as our wedding coordinator -- we could not have planned or prepared any better. It is absolutely unbelievable how smooth and seamless our wedding went. Both my fiancé and I are still in disbelief as to A) How beautiful the venue was and B) How fun the wedding was. Because of the unique balance between both aesthetic beauty (I mean, c'mon, what beats Napa Valley?) and logistics/floor plan of the venue, I'm a firm believer that this location was made for weddings first -- and it just happened to also be a country club as well. I honestly would not have changed a single thing from our wedding day. It will forever be ingrained as the start to my marrying my best friend.

ul setting (in my opinion) in all of Napa/American Canyon, and you don't have to break the bank. It's truly a great venue for big or small weddings, the initial cost is complete reasonable, and of corse if you have to have a large wedding like mine the costs do add up but Chardonnay was the venue of my dreams. I am so lucky to have found it. Noy completes the package, her attention to detail and willingness to help at all time is amazing. I would say if you are reading this, take the time to go visit Chardonnay and the property, have lunch and make the best decision ever by having your wedding there. It's been almost 1 month since my big day and my guests are still raving about Chardonnay, the food, tent and how effortlessly the evening flowed.

We got nothing but compliments during our entire rehearsal dinner and wedding because of how gorgeous and lush green the venue is. Their staff is great and really took care of our guests. We would definitely recommend Chardonnay Golf Club to anyone who is looking for a venue outdoors in the Napa Valley, a super flexible team, and hard liquor and music that is allowed to be played until midnight!! No where else in Napa can you find all this!! So grateful to have found Chardonnay!!
