Looking for a new wallet that could transition to a purse or belt bag and this fits the bill perfectly! My pervious wallet was leather and several years old, so I've been used to a...

more flexible and expandable wallet but I'm hoping this new one gets softer with time. Service was fantastic as I was trying to decide between the grande and the slim wallet and had to make a second order and process a refund, all quite easily. They even extended a limited time discount for my additional purchase! Once I see how the wallet holds up, I've got my eye on satchel. Please note: ordered directly through Arden Cove's website.

I have been using this bag as my ONLY purse for a full year now. I travel full time and my #1 priority is to keep my belongings and my information safe, so this purse is a game cha...

nger for me. I love the cut-proof chain, the slash-proof material, it's waterproof and it keeps RFID readers from stealing my credit card info. I get compliments on it all the time as I wear it through Europe, Asia, Canada and the States! The midi size is perfect for me as it holds all my cards, phone, small camera, passport, a few key makeup items and my TEP wireless hotspot. I know they have a new line coming out soon and I will be the first in line to get any other bag styles they put out. There is no reason to spend 10x's the money on a purse that has no security features when this brand has it all. LOVE my Arden Cove!

I've got this purse in the full size and in navy blue and absolutely love it! What I love about it are the pockets and built in card slots. Instead of carrying my wallet around, I'...

ll just slip my ID and credit card in. It makes traveling lighter and more convenient. So far I've brought it on several trips - to South Korea, Singapore, and Hong Kong. Will be taking this on my honeymoon!

Where has this bag been all my life!?! brought the large bag on my honeymoon across 5 different countries. It was big enough to fit my camera, wallet, sunnies, phone, 2 passports ...

and cash. I loved the little clips to make sure nobody would steal from us!
