The perfect wedding hairstyle is something that makes you feel confident and comfortable, while also meshing with your gown and your entire vibe. That's where this neckline hair guide comes in. We've spoken to expert hairstylists to get advice on the right [wedding hairstyles](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-hairstyles-you-will-love) for each neckline out there, because your hair should complement the style of your gown rather than compete with it. That often means settling on your dress before you decide on a hairstyle, whether you're the bride, part of the wedding party or a guest. Read on for advice and hairstyle ideas to find the best look for you—and your dress.

## How to Choose the Best Hairstyles by Neckline

Before you start looking for a wedding hairstyle you love, take careful note of your [dress neckline](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-gown-neckline-glossary). "The neckline sets the tone," says Sarah Koseck, stylist at [Tricoci Salon and Spa](https://www.tricoci.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoqTZhNSQd3KqV97We100eKguozKk3CT6q7FXFlsCUd_i-AcxBFw) in Orland Park, Illinois. "It frames the face, neck and shoulders, so your hairstyle should work with it, not against it."

If you're not sure about which style would work best with your neckline, Koseck says to start by thinking about finding a balance. "Where do we want the eye to go?" she says. "The goal is always to create proportion and cohesion so that everything (hair, makeup, dress) feels intentional." For example, if your dress or neckline is more embellished or dramatic, you may want to opt for a simpler hairstyle to let the dress have its moment. If the neckline is simpler, you can make your hair a little more exciting. Opting for a dramatic neckline and a dramatic hairstyle can feel like too much, while keeping both very simple can feel like not enough.

Your [hair type](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-hair-type-tips) is also important to keep in mind. You never want to choose a hairstyle that doesn't work with your hair, no matter how great it sounds on paper. You know your hair best, so if you feel like you really want to show off your curls, for example, find a hairstyle that allows that and also looks good with your dress. 

Lastly, it's important to test out the hairstyle you're thinking about with your dress. "I always recommend having your [hair trial](https://www.theknot.com/content/prep-for-hair-and-makeup-trial) after you've chosen your dress so your stylist can help you decide not only what looks best with it, but also what feels right for you," says Lauren Paglionico, New York City-based stylist and founder of [Lrn Beauty](https://www.lrnbeauty.com/). Try your dress on right after your hair trial so you can see the full look and get a better idea of how you like it. 

If you're still searching for the right [wedding hairstylist](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/beauty-services) for you, The Knot Vendor Marketplace makes it easy to find stylists in your area.

### Hair for Sweetheart Neckline Dress

A sweetheart neckline is versatile and gives you a lot of options. "This neckline can handle more volume and length," Koseck says. For hairstyles with a sweetheart neckline, you can stick with a classic blow-out or a [half-up hairstyle](https://www.theknot.com/content/half-up-hairstyles-for-long-hair) if you'd like to keep your hair down. Another option is a side part with glamorous waves. "The sweetheart shape is super feminine, and the waves complement that perfectly," Paglionico says.

### Hair for High-Neck Dress

The best [hairstyles for a high-neck dress](https://www.theknot.com/content/hairstyles-for-high-neck-dresses) are off your shoulders. "Hair should typically be up to let the neckline breathe," Koseck advises. She likes a clean bun, high ponytail or a French twist, all of which help to create length and elegance without leaving your look crowded. Paglionico also likes a soft, low bun with a high neck. The exception to the updo advice could be if you have shorter hair, in which case leaving it down to your shoulders or chin can look beautiful.

### Hair for Halter Dress

A halter neckline should be considered similar to a high-neck dress—your hair will look best up or pulled back. "A chic chignon is the way to go with a halter dress because the dress has sleek lines and they'll complement each other," Paglionico says. Koseck recommends an updo, like a bun or [ponytail hairstyle](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-ponytail-hairstyles).

### Hair for V-Neck Dress

"A deep V pairs beautifully with styles that echo the vertical line," Koseck says. "Think a sleek low ponytail, soft waves worn to one side or a structured updo with height." If you want your hair to be down over your shoulders, Paglionico likes a half-up hairstyle with a V-neck, saying "it looks effortless but still pulled together." And for shorter hair, leaving it with just a slight wave or a side part is a gorgeous hairstyle for this dress style.

### Hair for Strapless Dress

This neckline is so versatile—you can really pick any [hairstyle for strapless dresses](https://www.theknot.com/content/hairstyles-for-strapless-dresses), whether you leave your hair down or pull it back. As Koseck notes, "there's more space to work with," giving you plenty of options. If you're going for romantic and classic, leave your hair down in a [side-swept style](https://www.theknot.com/content/long-hair-to-the-side) or glamorous waves. If you want something different, Paglionico likes a voluminous ponytail. "It's fun and flirty," she says. For a sleeker look, pull your hair back into a bun with a center part.

### Hair for Off-the-Shoulder Dress

There's something about an off-the-shoulder dress that just feels very romantic and glamorous. That's probably why both Paglionico and Koseck recommend [hairstyles for off-the-shoulder dresses](https://www.theknot.com/content/hairstyles-for-off-the-shoulder-dresses) with a similar vibe. Koseck likes a [bun hairstyle](https://www.theknot.com/content/bun-hairstyles-for-wedding) or soft chignon, saying, "Pulling the hair up showcases the shoulders and collarbone while still feeling romantic." Paglionico recommends a French twist because it's classic, timeless and allows the neckline to stand out. You can also feel free to leave your hair down in a classic blowout, or soft, brushed-out curls or waves.

### Hair for Square Neckline Dress

A square neckline tends to feel more modern than some other options. "This structured neckline benefits from equally clean, graphic lines," Koseck says. Hairstyles for this dress neckline that she recommends are a center part with sleek, tucked-back hair or a sculpted ponytail for a look that is modern and chic. Paglionico also likes a middle part, with hair tucked behind the ears or pinned back into a half-up style. "The middle part mirrors the shape of the neckline and helps balance the look," she says. "It accentuates the shoulders and decolletage and really shows off the facial features beautifully."

### Hair for Scoop Neckline Dress

A scoop neck is romantic and pretty versatile. While it may be more low-cut, it's less harsh than a V-neck. For this dress neckline and hairstyle, you still want to keep your hair back a little to show it off. Paglionico likes something fun, like braids or boho braids. "It adds a little texture to the look without covering the neckline," she says. If you want to keep your hair down, tuck it back behind your ears.

### Hair for One-Shoulder Dress

These dresses have a similar sculptural look to a square neckline, so [hairstyles for a one-shoulder dress](https://www.theknot.com/content/hairstyles-for-one-shoulder-dresses) should include clean, tighter looks. Paglionico recommends balancing out the look of a one-shoulder dress with a side part and straight hair swept to one side, or a side-swept [wedding updo](https://www.theknot.com/content/updos-for-long-hair). If your dress feels more glamorous, then vintage-inspired waves or curls may work too.

### Hair for Boat Neck Dress 

A boat neck dress is going to be a bit similar to a high neckline. That means your best bet is pulling your hair back, like into a soft, low bun or something more sleek. And since boat necks can be very elegant, a sophisticated style like a chignon works well too. However, if you want to keep your hair down and your wedding is taking place during the summer, Paglionico says beach waves are a good hairstyle for this dress neckline.

### Hair for Cowl Neck Dress

Stylish and unique, a cowl neck dress calls for an equally chic hairstyle. "Vanessa Hudgens' slick back knot," Paglionico says. "It's so chic. Not too high or low, right in the middle is perfect." 

![brides in a blue suit and cowl neck dress](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/5c3b0e2e-350b-4ecb-ae38-9d50bcd9b229~rs_768.h-cr_67.0.1134.800)

### Hair for Backless Dress 

A backless dress is meant to show off your back. The best [hairstyles for open-back dresses](https://www.theknot.com/content/hairstyles-for-open-back-dresses) are going to be some sort of updo. A bun really makes the back stand out, but if you want some hair there, opt for a long, voluminous ponytail. If you have shorter hair or a bob, feel free to leave it down or put it in a half-up hairstyle.
