Carleigh Foggiato 

Owner

Hi! I'm Carleigh and I've been a wedding photographer since 2013. I learned how to shoot on film while traveling around the world after I finished my undergraduate degree. I originally planned to become an attorney, but after I graduated law school I just couldn't stop thinking about photography so I left my Silicon Valley IP law firm to photograph people full time and I've never looked back. I've photographed hundreds of weddings now over the last decade and even though my style has evolved I still fall in love with the emotion and memories of every single wedding I shoot.

If I could give Carleigh more than five stars, I absolutely would! She is truly a ray of sunshine — kind, warm, and full of positive energy. From the very beginning, she took the t...

ime to meet with us multiple times before the wedding, getting to know us and our story. By the time the big day arrived, it felt like we were spending the day with an old friend. Carleigh brought such calm and joy to every moment and somehow managed to capture all the emotions and little details . She didn’t just document our wedding — she made our special day even more special. We’re endlessly grateful for her! 💛

I wish there were more stars that I could give Carleigh! She is seriously AMAZING! I was lucky enough to have a few friends work with Carleigh in the past, so I knew well before I...

was engaged that no matter when the wedding was, I wanted her to be our photographer. From our first meeting, through the wedding, she brought her A-game, and I could not be more thrilled with the way the photos turned out. One of the things I love about Carleigh is that she recommends taking engagement photos to give her an opportunity to get to know the couple well before the wedding. That way, when the big day comes around, she is totally versed in our likes, dislikes, what we want, what we don't, our personalities, how we act together, etc. She was so helpful with building out our full day-of timeline/schedule, and really stuck to it. For me, who is a stickler for time and hates running late, I could not have been more thankful. I could honestly ramble for days about why Carleigh is the ONLY choice as far as photographers go, but really and truly, I could not have been happier working with her! She is one of a kind!

Carleigh is absolutely wonderful. I knew she'd be my wedding photographer even before I was engaged. I've worked with her in the past and have always appreciated her down-to-earth,...

yet professional and efficient approach to her work. She knows how to get the good shots and quickly! Carleigh also shot our engagement photos and was willing to do 2 separate mini shoots so we could have photos with my step-kids and also with just myself and my now-husband (which was totally above and beyond). With only a couple weeks to our wedding, I was concerned that we weren't going to get enough groom-getting-ready photos because we were getting ready in 2 different locations. Mind you, Carleigh was willing to run back and forth between the 2 locations, however she was able to find a second photographer to join her that was also great! Carleigh was instrumental on our wedding day. Not only is she Wonder-Woman (she was about 6-7 months pregnant at our wedding), she ended up helping with the most random things -just because she's such an expert!-, like how to fasten my dress and some other things I can't remember now, but I remember thinking "thank goodness Carleigh is here!" Carleigh was even able to get my mother-in-law to smile for some photos (she's notorious for avoiding any and all photos of herself). All my guests thought she (and the other photographer) were great and we have lots of beautiful photos from our special day to prove it! My husband also wanted me to add: her prices are reasonable, her timing is reasonable (within 3 months of the wedding date), she delivered on everything she promised, her shooting and editing styles are timeless and not overly-processed. She's not into following trends and she typically keeps a wide frame to allow for maximum cropping flexibility. She will deliver many, many beautiful, original photo files for you to use however you please and to enjoy for the rest of your lives together!

Carleigh is one of a kind. We love working with her and plan on doing it forever and ever! She is willing to do whatever it takes to help the day go smoothly from helping you hide ...

in her car to avoid being seen to being flexible regarding timelines when things don't go according to plan. I love her easygoing nature, her professionalism and her warmth. Her work captures authentic moments and dynamics without being staged or overdone. She is a true gem and I would highly recommend her work! We look forward to seeing what she captured.

Carleigh shot our wedding pictures in January 2015. She was absolutely fantastic! From the first time we emailed her to ask about her availability, our experience with her was th...

e best. She responded right away and was immediately interested in the details of the wedding. I was concerned because our wedding was indoors at night and most of the photographs we were seeing online were outside. She assured me that she had experience and qualifications to shoot indoors. She met with us prior to the wedding and we were able to clarify what we wanted and ask her questions. The day of the wedding she put us right at ease and was extremely unobtrusive. She was quick as well. I have to say, our pictures were WELL WORTH the price. They turned out far, far beyond our expectations and captured our day perfectly. Bottom line: booking Carleigh will be the best decision you'll make about your wedding day. She is a consummate professional and we couldn't be happier with our finished product.

She is now a part of our lives and we are never going to let her go!

Carleigh is by far the best photographer there is! Let me start by saying she made the experience simple, fun and easy from start to finish. She is so sweet and really cares about ...

her clients and their special moments. You can see it while she is working and in the photos. We did our engagement and wedding photos with Carleigh and I love each and every one of them. She really captures every moment. As one of her other reviews says, "the photos tell a magical story", and they truly do. My husband and I had such a great time with Carleigh. The wedding party and wedding guests thought she was a blast too! She was more like a guest at the wedding than a photographer. We didn't even realize there was a camera in front of us snapping shots. I really can't say enough about how wonderful Carleigh is and can't express my gratitude to her for capturing my wedding day in such a perfect way. My only problem is I can't decide on which photos to order because I love each and every one of them! I would recommend Carleigh to everyone and will definitely be working with her again in the future.

We used Sweet Poppy Studios for our wedding in June 2014. Carleigh is not one of the best, she IS the best! Every step of the process - from choosing the package, nailing down a ti...

meframe, planning site visits, meeting vendors, etc. - was easy and done with the utmost professionalism. Even though I had been in the event planning business for awhile, Carleigh brought up wonderful points and helpful suggestions that I totally overlooked or didn't think were important. She also did our rehearsal dinner pictures as I wanted some more intimate family pictures, and it was just like having another family member there with us. She is very personable, friendly, outgoing, and has an amazing eye. Our wedding was mostly outside and spread-out along 3 different parts of the venue, and every single picture came out perfectly! She and her assistant, knew exactly where to be and when to be there to capture the best lighting, and candid photos of our guests and us. Every time we look at our photos, it takes us back to that day and the specific moment of the photo. I can honestly say that I will use Sweet Poppy Studios for EVERY event I have in the future and recommend everyone do the same. We cannot thank Carleigh and Marissa enough for going above and beyond our expectations! xoxo

Carleigh and her team at Sweet Poppy Studios was an obvious choice for my husband and I when we got engaged. She is incredibly personable and was able to make my camera-shy husband...

very comfortable. She has techniques for taking great shots without making you feel uncomfortable or awkward. Beyond being incredibly smart, always fun to talk to, and incredibly talented, she actually cares about her clients. She dies everything she can to make the day run smooth including checking in with the coordinator, working with the videographers, DJ, etc to make sure she can always get that perfect shot. She is professional, prompt with email responses, and holds her work to a very high standard. Overall, I highly recommend using Carleigh for any of your big life events, usually beginning with your engagement and wedding, then keep her in the family and have her take photos of your growing family. She does it all! Her style is very organic, photojournalistic, and always tells an accurate story of the day or time in life. I LOVED my wedding photos, and I know my friends and family did too!
