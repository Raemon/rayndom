I cannot express enough how incredible my experience was at Jin Wang! From the moment my mom and I walked in, I was warmly welcomed by Abigail, who truly made my dress shopping exp...

erience magical. Jin's attention to detail and genuine care for her clients is unparalleled. She took the time to understand my vision, preferences, and concerns and helped me find the perfect dress that exceeded my all of expectations. Her expertise and eye for design made me feel confident and beautiful every step of the way. The selection at Jin Wang's studio is exquisite, with a wide range of styles and sizes that cater to every bride. What really set Jin Wang apart from other bridal shops was the on-site alteration experience. As a bride, the less you have to do with ANYTHING, the better. I noticed at other stops, you typically had to pick up your dress and take it somewhere across town to have some third party alterations company take care of the alterations/hemming. Jin treats every single dress she works on like a piece of art and it is evident that she pours her heart and soul into each piece she works on. The quality of the dresses is top-notch, and the alterations process was seamless. Jin and her team ensured that my dress fit me like a glove, and I couldn't be happier with the final result. It was only an added bonus that we had a little "rehearsal" of the wedding day with her in her beautiful showroom where she showed me how to best carry my bouquet day of, how my father and husband should walk next to me with the type of dress I chose (things you would never think of!) and how to best pose for photos with the style dress I had. If you are looking for a personalized and memorable bridal shopping experience, I highly recommend Jin Wang Bridal. Jin's passion and professionalism make it a truly standout boutique. Thank you, Jin, for helping me find the dress of my dreams and for making my shopping experience SO incredibly special!

fect, a simple, sweet Lela Rose gown that was both fun and timeless. When COVID-19 hit the states, I felt so lucky to get to work with Jin Wang. They answered all my frantic emails and made sure my dress arrived on time. I was in THE BEST hands, literally. Getting to work with Jin was truly a dream come true. She is meticulous, stylish and kind. My dress was perfect, I picked it up the week of the wedding and didn't even feel compelled to try it on before the day, I trusted Jin so completely. I'm so grateful I chose Jin Wang!

I could not recommend Jin and her bridal shop enough. I had a specific piece in mind through designer that shipped sample sizes to her shop. Jin's team made this process easy and o...

nce they arrived at the shop I got to come into her beautiful space to try them on and others the shop carries. The process felt personal, not rushed and my time and decision felt valued. I did end up choosing the piece I special ordered. Jin's staff then placed the order for me through the designer, measurements were sent and all I had to do was wait for it to be shipped back. Alterations were complicated, due to the piece and my small frame, but I appreciated again and her staff for their professional nature, honesty and expert eye for what alterations were needed. Jin is so sweet and accommodating. I could have sat and chatted with her all day. Again, I felt valued and pampered as we really worked together to try the piece on through the process of alterations and the finished product. Once it was ready, it was shipped to my wedding destination, beautifully packaged. I wish I could go through the process all over again! I enjoyed it so much and am so grateful to Jin, her staff for making me feel like the most beautiful bride in my stunning wedding jumpsuit.

in made me feel from the moment we first met all the way through to the wedding day. I find myself recommending Jin to friends who aren't even planning a wedding! Unlike other studios, Jin and her team acutely understand the diversity in preferences across their clientele and dedicate the time and attention to turn 'dream looks' into reality. I ended up choosing a Carolina Herrera gown (Jin picked it for me and it was love at first sight) and it truly felt like I was working with the designer herself. Further, I can proudly admit that the confidence I felt on my wedding day can be attributed to the work of Jin and her team. Jin's artistry, orientation to detail and high-end design and exquisite execution and follow through embodies nothing less than a 5 star experience. Thank you Jin for making me feel like a queen. :)

rom Jin. The experience of trying on dresses there was above and beyond what one could hope for: a beautiful salon, an exquisite collection of dresses, an attentive, knowledgeable, and encouraging staff, and a clear investment in giving my daughter exactly what she envisioned for her wedding day. Jin handled all the alterations personally, and I have never seen someone so attuned to the details that would create the most flattering fit. She recognizes clearly how this is not simply a purchase, but a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and she earnestly wants to know the story that brought you to her door. She spent extensive time to review both bustling the dress and how to walk down the aisle. She welcomed an extended entourage into the space and calmly listened to and assured opinionated aunties. She creatively found a way to incorporate a piece of my wedding veil into my daughter's dress, recognizing the emotion that went into this symbolic gesture. Working with Jin Wang was one of the most memorable and happiest parts of the wedding planning, and I offer her my highest recommendation!

I looked exactly like I'd hoped on my wedding day and was absolutely in love with my dress.

ly gorgeous, every woman at Jin Wang's is courteous, helpful and attentive. They are genuine and friendly--they never make you feel that you are in a stodgy, pretensions atmosphere, despite how beautiful the showroom is. The experience is like walking into a home filled with your girlfriends, all of whom are exceptionally talented, professional and knowledgeable. My first visit was so much fun. Before getting started, we spoke in detail about my style, what I was looking for, and why I came to Jin Wang. The first consultation really encourages reflection; it helps you understand what dresses you might like and why. I had an idea of what I wanted from some online searching--I then picked out some dresses in the showroom, cross-checking them with what I'd chosen online to really zero in what I was looking for. I had gone to two other shops before Jin Wang, which were lovely in their own ways, but the level of attention to detail--what I liked what I did not--was incomparable. The level of responsiveness and communication was also unmatched. You can always get through to a person on the phone or via email. In a world filled with automation and impersonal experiences, this is anything but! The fittings were amazing. Jin is so fun to be around, and she really listens. Her wonderful, bubbly personality made my mother and I look forward to every appointment. She spends time with you and is never, ever rushed. Jin never proceeded without my full buy-in and approval; she is one of the most respectful people I have ever met. Not only is she respectful, but she is extremely talented. My dress alterations sounded simple, but with all of the different layers of the Pronovias gown, it ended up being extremely complex! I cannot tell you just how talented she is. She has the mind of an engineer when it comes to problem solving, but the grace and delicate hand of a designer. It is incredible to watch her work. Jin even took the time to show me how to walk in and hold my gown. She went over the bustling in detail with us, gave us tips on how to care for the dress, as well as how to get in and out of it. She went above and beyond because she really cares for her clients. It really was privilege to work with Jin and I recommend her to anyone and everyone looking for a bridal shop with both taste and heart.

From the minute I saw it, to the last second I wore my dress on my Wedding Day, the whole experience was amazing. All thanks to the fittings and experience of Jin Wang and her Team. Her San Francisco studio is beyond beautiful and every time I visited her was an absolute treat. We did several fittings and transformed my dress to fit me and my personality. Every fitting was so incredible and Jin listened to what I wanted and made the dress fit me and my style perfectly. I can't recommend Jin Wang enough to brides, future brides, and everyone and anyone that wants their Wedding Dress experience to be enjoyable and memorable. Thank you Jin! I am better for knowing and working with you. Stefanie married on October 27, 2018 in Palm Springs in a Carolina Herrera Dress Fall 2018. Purchased and tailored at Jin Wang.

First of all when you call, you can reach a human being! I've called a few other stores in SF and it was annoying to not be able to reach a human on the other line during business ...

hours. I would then get a call back and end up playing phone tag when I was busy at work. It was easy to make an appointment and her new space reflects her as a designer, sleek and modern with a touch of traditional. Her staff was warm and welcoming and made my friends and family feel right at home. Jin has a wide variety of dresses and price points. I feel in love with a Pronovias dress that was a show stopper and modern with a little lace. The most important part was that I could salsa dance in it when it was bustled. We cut about 2-3' off of the train but still had enough for a train. The first fitting took longer because of my short torso and Jin needing to get the top piece just right on my body. At the second fitting, there was nothing to fix. It was perfect! It fit like a glove! She does all her alterations in-house so there is continuity there and yes, there is parking where she is located. Jin is professional and I loved working with her and her team. I received many compliments on the dress. If you want proof, go to instagram and search for #eandcdoitbig to see our epic wedding.

ns out the dresses weren't working for my body type. At Jin wang, they showed me options that I would have never chosen as well as what I thought I wanted and I ended up falling in love with a dress I would have never chosen. From the first to last fitting, she takes the time not only for the dress fitting but the whole process of wearing the dress on your wedding day, taking care of it while you are wearing it, and preservation. She prepares you for that day and everything about your dress. It was the best process to go through with Jin Wang. Highly recommend her to any bride!

I had an amazing experience at Jin Wang. My sister and I had appointments at three SF bridal salons on one day and Jin Wang was the second stop of the day. She asked me some insigh...

tful questions about my taste and what I was looking for and the dresses she pulled for me showed that she really understood what I was looking for. She has an excellent eye for what will be flattering on a woman and great taste. There was no pressure to purchase on the first visit and I ended up going back with my mom on a later visit and selecting one of the original dresses she had pulled for me. My mom and sister ended up getting dresses there as well and we all received excellent service at each of our fittings with Jin personally handling pinning us for the alterations. Not many bridal salons do alterations in-house anymore and it was reassuring that I didn't have to entrust my dress to another tailor. Her team was also very responsive when I emailed with questions in between visits. At my last fitting, Jin gave super helpful instructions on how to get dressed in the morning to minimize risk of getting my dress dirty, how to sit gracefully in my dress, and how to walk down the aisle with my dad to best show off my dress. It was sad saying goodbye to Jin at my last fitting but hopefully I'll be back some day with another lucky bride!

I had an awful experience as a Jin Wang Client. Jin charged me an obscene amount for money for alterations which were almost the price of the dress itself. She insisted that I did...

n’t need to try the dress after the final fitting as the last alteration was so “minor”. However the dress didn’t close when I decided to try it in the day before my wedding day. When I told her, she blamed “weight gain” (it wasn’t, I was the smallest of ever been on my wedding day). Dealing with Jin herself was the worst part, she was rude and condescending throughout and added so much unnecessary stress with her attitude. I would avoid Jin Wang at all costs, it really was my only one wedding regret :(

Every single girl I know in SF has gone to her for their dress and has had the exact same experience. She altered my dress significantly (opened up the back) at no additional cost which was incredible. Nowhere else compares, trust me.

My mom and sister live across the country, and Jin and her employees were so accommodating and helped me facetime them in, take photos/videos to send them, and really made them feel like a part of the process despite being so far away. Additionally, Jin herself went truly above and beyond when the dress I had ordered was not complete in time for my first fitting, despite having scheduled it months in advance and my mom having flown out to San Francisco to be there in person. Needless to say, this was definitely a set back. Jin, after trying everything she could to get the designer to send the dress back in time, then took it upon herself to solve the problem to the best of her ability. She had the sample of the dress flown in for my appointment, talked through the adjustments we wanted made with my mom, waved of the tailoring costs for my future fittings and personally helped me get the perfect fit and bustle -- all in time for the big day! Thank you Jin!

I cannot say enough about how outstanding our entire experience was with Jin Wang & her team. I am the mother of a lovely bride who could never decide on her Halloween costume & ye...

t there we were, so many years later, trying to select THE gown. We went to every bridal shop & department store the Bay Area has to offer & tried on many, MANY styles. We experienced a range of salespeople & salon settings, and overall were exhausted & increasingly disappointed/frustrated by the process. Finally we met with Jin & from the beginning, we were treated with the utmost consideration, warmth, humor, kindness, professionalism & creativity. Jin listened so patiently to everything my daughter thought she wanted her dress to be, helped bring her vision into focus & still worked within our budget to narrow the decision process in such a positive fashion! The salon is easy to get to by either public transportation or car - there is a large parking garage right in the next block - & the setting is simply beautiful: bright & airy so you can see the beautiful dresses in NATURAL light, not some greenish-tinged department store setting. The selection is outstanding & there is no pressure to decide. Yet, when asked for an expert's opinion, Jin was honest & supportive & practical, which really helped my daughter as she made her decisions in everything from shoes to accessories. We ended up with the most perfect gown that could have ever been created for her - a lovely, modest boat neck front with a flowing skirt (with pockets!), deep vee back with elegant & perfectly proportioned straps, removable train & distinctive bustle panels. It complemented my tall, athletic girl so beautifully! Although Jin had a range of lovely veils to choose from, my daughter decided wear my 42-year old veil & Jin was completely supportive of that decision & creatively modified the crown so that all of a sudden, the 70s style mantilla looked fresh & absolutely perfect. Throughout the process, whether we had a random elderly grandmother in tow, or an infant grandson, or loving but opinionated sisters, Jin & her entire team were timely, genuine & a whole lot of fun. They went out of their way to accommodate my daughter's hectic work schedule & timed fittings in such a way to make the process remarkably relaxed. From start to finish, it was the perfect experience. Honestly, save yourself(ves) the stress of going from salon to salon like we first did. In planning a wedding, there are SO many choices but with Jin Wang Bridal, we were in the best possible hands for what is a deeply personal experience. Along with what turned out to be an absolutely beautiful wedding, working with Jin & her team is truly one of the happiest memories of the entire year.

My experience at Jin Wang was truly amazing. I was recommended to go to Jin by a colleague who got her wedding dress there years before. She said Jin was the best and would know ho...

w to pick the perfect dress for me, and she was absolutely right. During the first visit, Jin asked what I liked and didn't like about dresses I had seen at other stores, and she picked a couple for me to try on. The dress that ended up being THE dress literally checked all the boxes and then some and yet was something I never would have picked for myself. When I put it on, all of my girls knew immediately that the dress was the one. I had tried on plenty of dresses at other stores that looked good, but none of them were amazing. The dresses at Jin's store weren't generic wedding dresses and when I tried on my wedding dress, you could tell that it was special. The quality service continued throughout the fitting process. It was always easy to make appointments, and they were great about making sure to let me know when the dress would be ready for fittings since some of my bridesmaids live out of town and wanted to come to the fittings, which required booking flights in advance. Jin and her team were also great at accommodating all of my guests during these appointments. I ended up having an entourage a few times, and they seamlessly made sure there was room for everyone and that it was a special experience when we were there. During the fittings, Jin also had a great eye for detail, and she was very careful in making sure the dress fit perfectly. Jin also picked out a gorgeous veil that complemented the dress, and she even gave me tips on how to walk with the dress and pose in it for pictures. She also created an amazing bustle and made sure that my bridesmaids understood how it worked. Jin truly provides a full service experience and she is the best at what she does. We had an amazingly beautiful wedding, and I got a lot of compliments, and most of them were for the dress! If you want the real deal, go see Jin!

in Wang and I'm so glad she did. A beautiful space, lots of inventory and very personalized service. We found a Lela Rose gown which Jin had made in a beautiful wedgewood blue, complementary to the wedding palette. She customized the dress for me, adding cap sleeves and designing and making a stunning shawl/jacket to match my dress. Jin herself did both of my fittings and even customized an existing necklace of mine to wear the day of the wedding. I received lots of compliments on my beautiful gown. Jin and her staff are terrific - high quality, beautiful gowns, very warm and personalized service, punctual - a great value. Jin obviously loves what she does and makes the whole experience a real pleasure.

Jin is the master. She made my sister's wedding dress about 12 years ago, and when I got engaged, we decided to ask Jin to reconstruct the dress so that I could wear it. She helped...

me to re-design it to make it my own (and so it would fit me). She removed the top of my sister's dress and constructed a new top that suited my style perfectly. The dress was incredibly flattering, and sewn with flawless attention to detail. She altered the bottom to fit me, but it had held up perfectly in the 12 years between my sister's wedding and mine and required no new materials. I'm going to do my best to keep it in good shape; hopefully one day my daughter can wear it!

ough both of my fittings and gave me spot on advice when it came to how to actually function in my dress on the day of the wedding (I thought it would be a piece of cake without any tips; I was totally wrong!). While Jin handles the fittings, her staff is extremely talented and, Lily (I highly recommend her) was actually the one who carefully listened to my feedback about other dresses and brought me the dress to try on that I eventually ended up buying. No pushy sales people here, only understanding associates who completely respect that this is a big decision and support the need to "sleep on it" for as long as you need. I cannot rave about this salon enough; you'll have to stop by for an appointment yourself and you will not be let down!

I went back for a second appointment to try on the dress I thought was the one, and the staff had picked out a similar, but better, dress given they knew my preferences that I ended up selecting. Jin does the fitting herself, and she's so meticulous and an absolute pleasure to work with. She made sure the dress fit perfectly! I had a lot of slight alterations in the lace that I wanted done, and Jin did an impeccable job. We all thought the dress looked better after the lace changes - she's a miracle worker. Great staff, great attention to detail, great selection of dresses.

I found Jin Wang Bridal while living in SF & I decided to buy my dress there even after I knew I would be moving to AZ. I flew back 2 times for fittings because it was SO WORTH it....

Like many brides, what I liked on a hanger didn't necessarily like me. The whole staff was warm, compassionate and patient and they ultimately suggested the dress that ended up being PERFECT for me and my body. The level of care, attention to detail, and professionalism made the experience of buying my wedding gown pleasurable and smooth. The alterations, including my custom bustle were perfect. I was so comfortable in my dress (which was strapless) and I never had to adjust it.

The boutique is stunning with dresses lined delicately around the sunlit boutique, fine attention to detail from the design assistants and not to mention Jin - her energy alone is worth the visit.

e a 5 star review once I received my dress which was scheduled for mid December after purchasing it in August. Unfortunately when calling to find out how much longer I should expect my dress to be I was informed it wouldn't be ready for an ADDITIONAL 4 months (so April delivery after ordering it in August). I will still have alterations that will need to be done and I live out of state so now I'm left with finding a tailor up in Oregon very close to my actual wedding do finish up everything else that I need. The staff did not seem apologetic and did not offer anything to help in compensation for this egregious tardiness. I am disappointed to say the least.

I visited Jin Wang recently and had a great experience. I worked with Allison and she was super sweet and professional. This is probably the salon where they gave me the most time ...

and I was able to try as many dresses as I needed to. I visited 10 salons in two different cities during my quest so you can trust when I say that this is a fantastic salon. My only criticism is the fact that they do not allow pictures and I understand why they do it but I think it is actually detrimental to them because for a bride like myself that needs to go to multiple salons before making a decision even if I saw something I really liked there because I did not have a picture of these gowns they ended up fading away in my memory and this is probably why ultimately I did not buy a dress at Jin Wang. Another thing I really loved is that they were not pushy about buying a dress right there and then which is what I needed because I was not going to buy a dress on my first visit. Beautiful dresses that you don't find anywhere else (believe me I looked) and great selection. I would definitely recommend it to any bride looking for a unique dress in the San Francisco area.

ere okay, but I found that the stylists would be dismissive towards my bridesmaids when they would try to suggest dresses for me. My experience at JinWang was definitely not that. First of all, I appreciated that they were open a little later during the week. Seeing as how weekend appointments book up quickly, being able to go after work during the week was always appreciated. Not to mention my bridesmaid and I usually had the salon to ourselves! On my first visit, the stylist pulled a LOT of dresses for me. She was very indulgent and gave her professional opinion whenever I asked, but otherwise she quietly stood back and let me form my own opinion without pushing any sale. Upon my second visit, once I had narrowed down my choice to two dresses, it was the same experience. No hard sell, no annoyance with how indecisive I was being or how long I wanted to pour over my choices. Once I finally chose "the dress" the entire staff was overjoyed! I received such warm and friendly service. Not to say that it wasn't warm before, but it was stepped up once I was a client. You could tell they were instructed to not make the hard sell and to be respectful of the bride's decision process. And once I was an official client it was like I was part of the family! Jin herself even came out to thank me for choosing them. My fittings went so smoothly and Jin was a blast to work with! She was respectful and friendly with not only me, but my bridesmaids and planner as well. I got so many compliments on my dress! It also fit PERFECTLY! There was a corset inside with bra cups she added so the only undergarment required was a thong. I went with a strapless dress and never once on my entire wedding day (I wore my dress for both ceremony and reception) did I fear it would slip down. Nor was I constantly pulling it up. Once I had told them I wanted the dress for both ceremony and reception, they were great at suggesting a lace jacket for the ceremony so that my reception look was a little different. Working with Jin was fantastic and I would recommend her salon to any bride. Her and her staff were a joy to work with and I will cherish my dress for many years to come.
