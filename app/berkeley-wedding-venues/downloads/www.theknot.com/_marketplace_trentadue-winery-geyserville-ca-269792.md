tunning views created a perfect backdrop for the day. The staff was incredibly welcoming and knowledgeable, offering excellent wine pairings and taking the time to explain the nuances of each selection. The event was well-organized, with a great mix of live music, delicious food, and of course, exceptional wine. It was a truly memorable experience, and I left with a renewed appreciation for Trentadue’s incredible wines. Highly recommend this venue for anyone looking to host or attend a special event in the heart of wine country!

g from the Midwest and East Coast, we wanted to showcase the beauty of wine country, and this venue exceeded all our expectations. Set amidst lush vineyards, the facility itself is flawless, and the ceremony took place on a stunning lawn area, surrounded by towering Redwoods. We were looking for a venue that offered both indoor and outdoor options, and Trentadue was perfect: the wedding was outdoors, while dinner and dancing took place inside. The staff was fantastic, and we still love our photos from that day. We continue to visit and cherish the memories we made here.

do a lot more. There's multiple different spaces that offered us a lot of flexibility (as well as a nice indoor area in case of rain or smoke during fire season). The coordinators and staff we worked with at Trentadue were very friendly and on top of it! They communicated quickly and were extremely helpful and attentive on the day of our rehearsal and wedding. You have to use their wine for your event but it tastes great and they provide a sizable discount. My partner and I loved our wedding and would definitely recommend Trentadue as a wedding venue.

Beautiful winery for a wedding! They have ceremony, dining, and some lounge furniture available, which is great because you don't have to rent it all. The grape arbor is amazing,...

and the venue is spacious enough to set up a few different areas for guests to be in AND has a huge indoor space in case you need it (though we didn't use it). This area in general can be crazy hot in the summer months so it's great to have the option! We loved it. Our one minor downside was that the champagne that they make was far too sweet for our taste, and they were fairly strict about allowing us to bring in an outside alternative, so we didn't have a champagne toast as we would have liked.

Everyone we worked with in the process was very kind and understanding and we appreciate their support in making our dream wedding celebration come true!

venue and the views are unforgettable. My husband and I felt like we got married in a quintessential wine country paradise and it felt so special. Our guests could not get over the views and we received so many compliments. Milestone Events (the company who does Trentadue weddings) and our wedding coordinator Macenzie Campolito made the whole process simple from start to finish. Macenzie was responsive, level headed when I was panicked, and big part of the planning and vendor arrangement process. Bride and groom do need to coordinate their own vendors for catering, flowers, DJ etc from a preferred vendor list but Milestone will help with rentals and offer input. Macenzie was also nice enough to work with us when we had our own DJ and photographer from home (Bay Area). Once chosen by us, Macenzie worked directly with all vendors and even held her own with my dad who is one tough Father of the Bride! Macenzie and Lesley were fantastic coordinators the day of the event. They were present and kept the flow of the event but were extremely non-obtrusive. We knew they were there as they gently guided us from ceremony to entrances to cake cutting and clean up but they did a great job of laying low and making sure everything ran perfectly. We could not have asked for a better day, a better venue or a better team! Thank you Trentadue Winery and Milestone Events!

Did not love the service we got here. We came from 3 hours away and we’re 2 minutes late for our scheduled tour. We were under the impression we would have a one on one appointment...

but it was a group tour and the events coordinator started without us. We awkwardly waited around while she finished with the other couple and it did not feel special to us. She even made a comment about how she is always on time, implying that we were not even though we were supposed to be the guests! The event coordinator didn’t seem to know a lot about the venue and walked us around without explaining much. Also a big con is that the tasting room is open the day of your wedding allowing guests to see your private event and use the parking lot and you can’t use any of the area near tasting room. Luckily we found an amazing venue that checked all the boxes!

Hi Emily, Thank you so much for your feedback and we apologize for your less than hoped f...

or experience. We have a policy within our team to explain that tours might be group tours if necessary due to our smaller staff size and wanting to accommodate as many folks as possible. We apologize if that was never communicated, as we are always happy to accommodate a 1:1 tour. That should have been offered as an option to you. We appreciate you taking the time to come see the venue and are so happy to see that you found a good fit at another property. Congratulations to you both.

roperty and the backdrops are beautiful for your dream wedding. They have a really good selection of wines and are very reasonable. Being on the premises helps you add on more wine as you go if you run low. Besides the venue, the folks that we worked with were incredibly helpful! Our wedding planner was really no good and Alyssa stepped in and took a huge load leading up to the wedding and way above and beyond on the day of the wedding, helping with the ceremony, the cake and also supervising our less than experienced staff with nothing but smile and grace. It was a bit of a difficult day with lots of family drama for me (ah the Jewish in-laws!) but working with Alyssa was truly a highlight and made life so much easier. You really do want to get married there! It's great to have a wedding planner but even if you didn't, you'll be just fine, thanks to the meticulous planning by folks at Trentadue.

They provided a list of recommended vendors, which proved to be so helpful, and went above and beyond to make sure our wedding was exactly the way we wanted it. They were always available when we had questions and to help us make decisions. We did not have a wedding planner, but on the day of the event, I was able to relax and enjoy myself because I knew that Alyssa had everything taken care of. Even when one of my guests accidentally spilled red wine on the back of my dress, Alyssa was right there with Wine Away and white cloths to make sure that it was cleaned up and didn't stain.
