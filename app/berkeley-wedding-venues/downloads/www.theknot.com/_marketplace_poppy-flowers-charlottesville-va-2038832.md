Cameron Hardesty

Owner

Poppy was founded in 2019 by Cameron Hardesty. While working at The White House in 2014, she learned floral design at The White House Flower Shop from her floral mentor, Laura Dowling, and, later with master florist, Gregor Lersch in Germany. After managing the florals for her own wedding, which was published in Martha Stewart Weddings, she saw an opportunity to pair farm-fresh flowers, talented designers and on-trend floral designs - at an affordable price. By sourcing directly from farm partners and working with local florists, we have now booked over 4,000 weddings across the U.S.

limit they were honest about that and didn't push us to buy more and when we did think of things they were ready and so helpful. They were fast and never made us feel rushed even though we started on the flower journey late. Once all the decisions were made and they had the money they didn't contact us at all unless they needed to and I always knew how to reach them quickly. We didn't have to think about it on the day at all. They dropped things off early for us and set up and the venue went off without a hitch. And everything they made was absolutely beautiful. I could absolutely go on and on and on.

I found the site clunky and the initial stage starting out was slightly confusing for me. Luckily, I didn't really have anything in particular in mind except my bouquet so I kind of just went with it.

Poppy Flowers absolutely blew me out of the park with their floral services for our wedding. Admittedly, I was a little nervous when I had originally found them since the majority ...

of your planning takes place online up until the wedding day, but our floral consultant, Sophia, was so attentive and responsive that my fears quickly went away. She was very thorough and listened to exactly what I wanted for my florals, and made sure she knew the details of the venue well. She took clear notes on what my color palette was and what types of flowers I wanted (or rather, didn’t want). On the wedding day, I met Bill, who came and formally introduced himself to me so I would know who to go to if I had issues. He also explained what each bouquet was for and how to apply them if they were corsages or boutonnières. All of the bridesmaids bouquet and my bouquet were in vases of fresh water, and he instructed how to hold them and dry them before the ceremony. He was available for any questions I had on the day, and was so helpful with my husband as well. One of the best perks of Poppy, in my opinion, is that they let you keep the flowers (and vases!). We reused them the next day for our post-wedding brunch, and many of the smaller bud vases on our dinner tables lasted for several weeks after. All of our guests complimented the stunning flowers and asked who our vendor was. I knew florals was going to be a large expense for our wedding, but let me tell you that for the service and standards you receive, choosing Poppy Flowers is absolutely worth it.

If florals are not a priority on your wedding day, Poppy Flowers is fair. You start with a consultant and video chat about your budget and vision. Their dashboard is easy to use an...

d customize from their set of different floral aesthetics. You do all of your communication with Poppy's consultant, and when your design plan and budget are locked in, they pass off everything to a local florist. (Our wedding was in Canton, MA.) And that's where there seemed to be a disconnect, which we didn't find out until the day of our wedding. I'll start with the positives and say I loved the floral installation on the gazebo at our ceremony and all of our bouquets. The biggest miss was that we ordered floral decor for our cake, but it was completely plain on the day of. The floral production manager said she provided some florals for the cake and that it was on the baker to place, but when we asked our coordinator if anything was set aside for the cake, she said she didn't receive or hear of anything from the florist. Even if florals were delivered for the cake, I thought it was unprofessional of the floral team not to make sure the venue coordinator or baker received them. Did they just drop them off in some corner and leave without communicating? We're so sad to not be able to use any of our cake-cutting photos, because our cake looks like plaster... When we communicated this to the floral production manager, she refunded us $30 (that's thirty dollars), which doesn't hold a candle to an important moment that we can't get back. Some of our guests even ask "Was your cake supposed to look like that?" It's embarrassing. To add, we paid for an installation of lush, trailing greenery on the ceiling beams of our reception space. I shared an inspo pic (which I'm including in this review for comparison) and specified that I wanted hanging greenery for our guests as they enjoyed their dinner. When I first walked into the reception space on the big day, the installation was such a letdown (picture also attached). It seemed really sparse compared to what I envisioned. I wish there were communication so I could either allot more of my budget to making my vision a reality or adjust my expectations before the big day. Overall, the communication between Poppy's consultants and the actual floral production manager seems to be lacking. Poppy Flowers might be worth considering if your floral vision is cut-and-dry (eg. 3 bouquets and boutonnieres). Anything beyond that, and you just have to hope for the best.

so allowed me to make my own choices if we disagreed. The flowers delivered to our outdoor ceremony were absolutely perfect and even better than I'd expected. We got two flower clouds, which we used for the ceremony and again at the reception. All the boutonnieres were gorgeous, and the bouquets were fresh and so lovely. I did not toss the bridal bouquet--sorry ladies. I kept it in a vase for a week and am now drying it so I can maybe keep it for some time. I loved the flexibility, freshness--and especially the transparency and pricin--of the flowers and services Poppy provides.

I cannot recommend Poppy enough! At first, I was really nervous about using a company where I wouldn’t actually meet my florist in person, but it turned out to be the biggest bless...

ing in disguise. With so much wedding planning on my plate, the last thing I needed was another meeting—and Poppy made the entire process so easy and stress-free. They carefully looked at all of my inspiration photos, took notes on every detail, and completely brought my vision to life. On my wedding day, I never even met my florist, which sounds scary at first, but it was actually incredible. Everything was already there, beautifully set up, and absolutely perfect without me having to worry about a thing. My bouquets were beyond stunning—honestly even more beautiful than any inspiration photo I had provided. The boutonnières were on the coolest sticky pads, which made it so easy for my groomsmen, and the corsages were on gorgeous gold bangles that looked elegant, unique, and so flattering with the flowers. One of the best parts is that all the vases, stands, and pieces were mine to keep. It felt so special to be able to bring them home and enjoy them after the wedding. Even a full week later, my flowers were still holding up beautifully, which speaks volumes about their quality. I’m already so excited to see what my preserved bouquet will look like because if it’s anything like what Poppy created for me on my wedding day, I know it’s going to be breathtaking. Thank you so much to the entire Poppy team—you truly made my floral dreams come to life and gave me one less thing to stress about on my big day. I am so in love with everything you did and will recommend you to every bride I know!

What I appreciated most about Poppy Flowers was the transparency and ease of use. Their website feels like a modern e-commerce experience, with clear pricing, flexible payment plans, and a chat feature where you can message a designer directly for requests or questions. The convenience was definitely a plus for me. Overall, I was thrilled with the process and the results. The florals were breathtaking, the experience was seamless, and I wish more wedding vendors offered this level of user-friendly design and transparency. Highly recommend Poppy Flowers for any couple looking for gorgeous florals and a stress-free planning experience!

The florals were so beautiful, a gorgeous citrus color palette for our summer wedding. I shared inspiration photos, and the actual flowers were more beautiful than anything I showed them. We paid about $3,200 for everything from flay lay florals and the flower box florals to the bouquet, corsages, boutonnieres, bud vases, flower clouds, and center pieces. I even had a gorgeous flower comb that lasted for days. Thank you, Adrienne and Poppy Flowers. Your platform was easy to use.

When setup began on my wedding day, I was filled with anticipation — and the moment I saw everything come together, I was absolutely speechless.

Poppy Flowers blew.me.away. I chose an expensive wedding venue already filled with beautiful flowers, so I wanted to be on the minimal side of floral arrangements. When I saw the m...

inimum spending requirements for Bay Area florists, I knew I had to find an alternative that met my budget. The process with Poppy started off wonderfully. It began with a very communicative floral consultant, (hopefully I’m using the correct phrase, as there were trade offs of people during each planning phase.) She explained the process to me and was very helpful. I felt I could customize almost anything and enjoyed seeing the options virtually which worked well for me. (Maybe this wouldn’t work well for everyone if you want to see things in person.) She left the company a few months later. The turnover worried me slightly, but clearly everything worked out in the end. Shortly after, I started working with Jenny…(again I’m not sure her official title!) She went out of her way to review the plan, set up a phone call, and communicate if I needed help. She sent me floral previews of my flowers and assured me that the day-of florist, Victoria, was reputable and talented. She even arranged for a second florist to assist with everything. All in all, I never even met the florists the day of the wedding. They followed the venue’s guidelines and the whole process was so seamless and professional that I didn’t need to check in once, or even know they were there. When I saw my bridesmaids with their bouquets, my mouth dropped. I admittedly had low expectations so I was floored with how perfect it all turned out. I loved the boutonnieres and adored the pergola decor. The extra centerpieces were arranged beautifully on other tables and guests loved taking the beautiful flowers home. I was truly in awe and so very grateful. Thank you Lissa, Jenny, and Victoria for everything. The flowers were more than I could have ever wished for!

got closer to the date the communication was slim. Emails only. I requested a meeting and was told I could interact through the portal this was 10 days prior to my wedding. I never heard from the actual designer for my wedding. I reached out to them via the generic number the day before to confirm they were actually coming. I also reached out the day of to confirm they were on the way. They did show up on time with the flowers but a little proactive communication could’ve saved me some anxiety. The bouquet they came with was small, wilted and not at all what I asked for. I didn’t even have my photographer take pictures of it. When I saw the archway I thought it was beautiful and asked them to remake my bridal bouquet to match it and they did! The saving grace was that they did remake it. The florist seemed frazzled and irritated and I let her know that it was the first time I had spoken to her in person! All in all remaking the bouquet saved this review. And the fact that I didn’t pay that much for it. My venue made my centerpieces etc. if flowers aren’t a top priority for you go forward with poppy.

I truly appreciate hearing that the archway and the remade bouquet were highlights and that we were able to adjust to better match your vision on the day of your wedding. However, your feedback has highlighted an area where we need to improve. Moving forward, we’re implementing a process to ensure proactive communication with our clients throughout the planning process. This includes clearer timelines, regular check-ins to address questions and ensure everything is on track, and a meeting with your day-of floral designer in advance of your wedding day. Thank you for helping us see where we can improve. If there’s anything else we can do or if you’d like to share further details, please don’t hesitate to reach out!

Loved working with Poppy! Their communication throughout the planning process and until the very end was great. As a bride that 1) never wanted flowers to go to waste, 2) didn't ...

want to spend an astronomical money on florals, and 3) wasn't extremely particular about the flowers for my wedding... POPPY WAS PERFECT. I don't even know when they were delivered because I was busy. I saw the centerpieces when I came in to the reception for the first time and they fit perfectly. If you're a low key bride that cares about the color palette of the flowers and trusts the professionals to get your vision right, Poppy is definitely for you! Currently drying my bouquet for a DIY keepsake! I ordered 10 table center pieces and my bouquet :)

Firstly, our assigned local designer, Lindsy Somers, hit it out of the park with our arrangements!!! They were gorgeous and everything I had wanted and imagined! If you use this co...

mpany, then you have to be comfortable with doing things virtually via chat/text and using the online portal. I personally found it easy to navigate, and I requested a video call to nail down the details the month before. At the start of planning, our flower consultant was helpful with making sure all of our questions were answered. I used the chat function and the texting number to communicate. She helped us make notes of custom requests and other design notes. As we neared closer to our date, the flower manager stepped in and made sure all of the notes and directions for the local team were in order. I did request a virtual video call where I was able to discuss the specifics of what I was looking for and ask any additional questions I had to the flower manager. She showed me the types of roses that would be used and how they would look (which is exactly what we got!). This helped me feel at ease and was definitely worth it! Overall, my flowers were STUNNING!!! The process was great for the price and the Poppy Team was very professional and everything went great on the day of!

If you are okay being hands off during the process, then Poppy Flowers is definitely a good choice for the price. We had a smaller wedding (30 people), and it was hard finding a fl...

orist that would fit our budget, since a lot of the places have 5K minimums. We chose a white and green color scheme, and the arrangements were beautiful (flower clouds for the ceremony, bud vases for the reception, bridal bouquet and boutonniere). Taking 1 star off because of the couple of issues (not critical): \- bridal bouquet had a couple of flowers that had brown edges at delivery (we had early personals delivery). I don't undestand how the florist didn't notice this, the rest of the arrangements were fresh, but still a bit disappointed, since these were the flowers I had with me for most of the day. \- after the initial call and order/payment, there was very minimal communication. I got to choose which flowers I liked/disliked, and that was it. From the explanation in the initial call it seemed like there would be more communication around the types of flowers ordered/designs etc. \- We added early personals delivery a bit later, and that created a lot of confusion for the payment. I got charged for it twice, and had to go back and forth a bunch with multiple people to prove that it was an extra charge. Definitely not something you want to be doing two weeks before the wedding. Overall, even with these mishaps the flowers were delivered and set up on time, they looked beautiful in person and on photos. It ended up being a good value for the price.
