Saw them in a small venue last evening. they BLEW US AWAY!!! Absolutely THE BEST. Cant wait till I get to hear them again. :-}

We couldn't have asked for a better band for our wedding! We absolutely loved The Cheeseballs. They listened to our requests for style/vibe (and what not to play - thanks guys!!...

), learned a few amazing songs for us, and totally jammed from classics like September by Earth, Wind, and Fire, to Shake it Off by Taylor Swift. (but don't just take these songs as example - their repertoise is amazing and incredibly broad - we only wish we could've heard even more of it!!). They also did a great job MC'ing the evening. Our guests had a blast on the dance floor and we never wanted the night to end. We would hire The Cheeseballs for any wedding or event where you want the dance floor to be a key part of your experience - you cannot go wrong. Finally, including the horns was also the best decision - we suggest not to hesitate, just do it!!

Big shout out to TCB for getting the job done like the bosses that they are (and sorry for the delay reviewing you!). This the band when you want the funk (and soul, and hip-hop, a...

nd rock, and current hits, and country). Eric + JSP and team went all the way for us and we will never forget it. Just go see them live. End of story. This is a real band with the same players every time (not a fake band, like some here). They had crazy skills, and knew exactly what they were doing. Recommended all the way.

Thrilled to have locked in one of our favorite bands for our big day. We haven't had it yet, but have seen The Cheeseballs for years (San Francisco, Napa, Tahoe) and knew from the ...

very first moment this was going to be our band. And we have them. I can confidently recommend them as reliable, professional, fun, and just the right dose of funk. BRING IT ON. CHEESEBALLS. 5 stars all the way. 10 if we can go that high.

I wasn't a bride (or a groom) but I have to rave about this band as I just came across their profile, as I am about to embark on looking for bands. Sadly, they. are booked for my...

upcoming wedding, but I went to two friends weddings where these guys delivered the hits. That was probably the most fun ive had on a dance floor in ages. It was all pure full on dance party, and I loved the way they brought the choreography. They had 3 singers, all of who dance, and what I will never forget is how amazing the drummer and bassist were, all locked into a groove and had us just smiling. Good vibes and positive energy. Hire them if you can!

We were so excited to work with the Cheeseballs for our wedding, however due to the pandemic, we never got to hear them live before we had our wedding. We joked when we met the fri...

endly and talented band members that we listened to their music on their website 1x a week...but it was really true! At our wedding, they had everyone on the dance floor, took our requested music into account, and kept the energy going. Many of our friends flew from NYC and are used to 12 person bands...they ALL told us that the Cheeseballs were the best wedding band they've experiences. Now THAT is incredible. Thank you, Cheeseballs!

Wow! Wow! Wooooowww!!! Did I say wow already?! We somehow managed to book the Cheeseballs last minute for our Friday wedding in February and they were phenomenal! They had so much ...

vocal talent I thought I was at Coachella! I actually had two wedding guests separately comment to me that they thought one of the vocalists was the real Pitbull! EVERYONE was on the dance floor the entire night and The Cheeseballs really cranked up the party! They were easy to work with, showed up on time, and really made our wedding 10x more fun!

d they came highly recommended. We wanted a mix of classic and modern hits. They provided the most perfect blend of songs that had everyone dancing. Not to mention vegas style show costumes and choreography. Classy and fun all in one! I can see why they are rated the Bay Areas Greatest Party Band.

y enjoyed their evening. We decided that a live band, rather than a DJ would really add to the atmosphere at our formal wedding. When choosing a band, The Cheeseballs stood out due to their large range of music options; however, what really sold us was their renditions of some oldies-but-goodies. We wanted everyone out on the dance floor the whole night and we got just that with The Cheeseballs. At our wedding we opted to have the additional horn section, which I do think made a difference, but the band as a whole was amazing! Their energy was great the entire evening, they even had a costume change. The band was easy to work with and pretty accommodating when it came to booking them and the requests they had for day of.
