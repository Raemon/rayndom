Katie and her team at Kreate Photography are delightful and exceptional! They were always respectful and kept us on track yet were never intrusive with candid shots. We were amaze...

d at how many special moments they captured as we were often unaware of their presence. We couldn’t be happier with our family photos and the care they took to capture so many unique moments at our daughter’s wedding. Katie’s positive energy and superb organizing skills were a calming influence throughout the day. As mother of the bride, I appreciated Katie spending time to learn a bit about me and any needs and requests I might have. She answered all my questions and I felt so comfortable around her and her team. We are simply thrilled with our wedding album and highly recommend Katie and her team!

on and capturing every moment that mattered to us. She was incredibly patient and supportive, and always made me feel understood and taken care of. Katie worked seamlessly with our planner to build a rain contingency plan for our fully outdoor venue, which ended up being put to the test when an atmospheric river rolled through Sebastopol on our wedding weekend. Even though we only got a few sprinkles during photos, Katie helped us make the most of those moments and kept everything fun, relaxed, and full of good energy. Her calm presence and great direction were a godsend! And the photos - wow. They turned out so beautifully and truly captured the joy and spirit of the day. We’ll cherish them forever. On top of everything, Katie embraced our non-traditional ideas like documenting our wedding jump house photos, which ended up being some of our favorites. She was creative, flexible, and genuinely excited to bring our ideas to life. We’re so grateful we chose Katie as our photographer. She’s talented, thoughtful, and an absolute delight to work with. We couldn’t recommend her more highly!

We couldn’t be happier with how everything turned out and are so grateful to have these memories preserved so perfectly. If you want someone who will go above and beyond to capture your special day, Katie is absolutely the right choice. Highly recommend!

plement to my (equally type A) personality. After a few photographer interviews, I told my fiancé, “I’ve found the one.” From our engagement shoot to our wedding weekend, Katie made everything feel effortless. She captured us so naturally, balancing precision and calmness with such ease. She is a true professional who managed to organize 40+ people for group shots without anyone feeling bossed around, all while keeping the mood light and fun. Katie photographed our engagement session, a small family wedding, our welcome party, and our big day. Somehow, she brought the same incredible energy, excitement, and love to every single moment. She has a rare gift for blending into the background while still making everyone feel seen and comfortable. The photos are stunning, but more than that, they feel authentic to who we are. She also connected us with our amazing videographer, Eli Contreras, and makeup artist, Marisa Perel, who were both incredible. We truly had a dream vendor team, and it all started with Katie. She is one of a kind, and I could not recommend her more highly.

I cannot say enough good things about Katie and the Kreate team. Katie was the lead photographer at our wedding in SF on 10/11/25, and she also shot our engagement photo shoot and ...

rehearsal dinner. With Katie and the team, the big things were dialed in and squared away with such professionalism and ease: Katie was diligent in planning the details of our wedding day - she worked to have an efficient shot list (my husband has a BIG Italian family), kept us ahead of schedule, and had a perfect plan for the entire day. She organized herself and her team to be as efficient as possible. Katie and her team have been in this industry for a long time and it shows – they knew exactly what to do and when to do it, and my husband and I didn’t have to stress at all. My husband has a huge family, and let me tell you, Katie’s work with our large, extended family photos was a thing of absolute beauty – she learned everyone’s names and had specific directions for each of them, including when and where they needed to be in family photos. We got done with 8 HUGE family photos (with upwards of 85 people in them all together) in 20 minutes, giving my husband and I a minute to ourselves before joining cocktail hour. It was truly amazing! While Katie and the team have the big things dialed down, what really impressed me was the little things. During one of the photos with my husband, I realized my breath smelled– Katie reached into her bag and handed me a Listerine spray to take my anxiety away about it. When our flower girl was crying during a photo, Katie’s second shooter Vanessa made silly faces to make her smile. When my husband I got anxious and overwhelmed with the chaos of the day, Katie guided us through a moment of taking a deep breath and just being together – something we didn’t realize we desperately needed. One of the best things I can say about Katie is the comfort and positive attitude she brought to all our shoots. We first met in person for our engagement shoot; my husband and I are not comfortable in front of the camera and have no idea what we're doing - we told Katie this, and she made us feel instantly comfortable at ease in front of the camera. She gave us natural movements to do along with our poses so that the photos came out more candid and truer to us. When it came to the rehearsal dinner, she captured the essence of the night beautifully without interrupting us or catching us in any unflattering moments (like eating or sneezing). And of course, we had felt so comfortable with her on our wedding day because of the relationship we’d built. Her team is just as vibrant and kind as she is, and so they made us feel right at home too for our special day! And of course, the photos are absolutely amazing! The team is incredible at posing, capturing authentic moments, and editing. I also appreciated the easy-to-use website to view the photos and ability to order prints and photo books right from there! Katie and her team will be more than a team of photographers for you – they will be your supporters, cheerleaders, therapists, and friends. Your photo team is who you spend the most time with at your wedding, so I knew I needed to be around a team that brought positivity and good energy, while still delivering an incredible product – and that’s exactly what Katie and the Kreate team did. I am eternally grateful to them and know we will continue to use them for future maternity and family photo shoots!

We recently celebrated our 10th wedding anniversary in Napa Valley and had the absolute pleasure of working with Katie for a photo session—and wow, she exceeded every expectation! ...

We hadn’t had professional photos taken since our wedding, so we were a bit nervous, but Katie immediately made us feel comfortable and confident in front of the camera. She was incredibly encouraging, fun, and knew exactly how to guide us into natural poses that felt just like us. Her energy made the entire experience enjoyable from start to finish. Not only was she amazing to work with, but we also received our photos incredibly quickly—and they are stunning! We’ll treasure them forever. 10 out of 10—would absolutely work with Katie again and recommend her to anyone looking for a talented and thoughtful photographer.

TL;DR - Kreate Photography flawless executed our Healdsburg, CA October 2023 wedding day from the planning all the way through the reception. I would absolutely recommend this busi...

ness. We first found Kreate Photography through a google search, and then it was recommended by our venue and planner. Our first interaction was a phone call (we are out of state and unable to meet in person) with Katie to discuss budget, timeline, and desired aesthetic. Katie really helped us understand what we needed to think about when considering a photographer, and she had multiple packages to choose from. We opted to book a package that included one photographer at the ceremony, reception, and golden hour and a second photographer for part of that time. Something that I greatly appreciate about Katie is that when the wedding grew closer (and RSVP's started coming in) and we had a better idea of final costs, she worked with us to expand our package. We ultimately added "getting ready" photos and more time with the second shooter. Additionally, we had a videographer from another vendor, and Katie's team was able to work seamlessly with her to capture our day. We LOVE how the photos came out, and would most definitely recommend Katie and her team to anyone. Special thanks to Emily who really listened to our specifics helped make our day perfect forever.

Katie saved my wedding plain and simple. She is a superb photographer, her portfolios speak for themselves and I knew from our first call that she was going to be the perfect fit f...

or my wedding. What I didn’t know was how impossible the whole wedding would have been without her. When our day of coordination team failed to do their job. Katie jumped in both the role of photographer and coordinator making sure everything was set up correctly that the staff had been communicated with, making sure we got where we needed to be on time ect. On top of taking some of the most stunning photos I have ever seen. So I am not exaggerating when I say that she saved my wedding. Things always go wrong at any wedding and choosing vendors that you trust is needed so you can stay calm And enjoy your day. Katie went above and beyond this expectation and her sole and direct effort made it the day I’ll never forget for good reasons rather than bad. As a photographer she quickly put my photo phobic husband and ease and wrangled family members. Her photos did more catch a moment but really highlighted the personalities of my loved ones. It was by far the best money spent on my wedding and I would do it over again. I also added on a boudoir session with Katie before the wedding. She was wonderful to work with even in the vulnerable scenario and made me very comfortable. I hope to use her services for many life events to come. Do not hesitate to hire her or give it a second thought you are in the excellent hands!

l lighting and the most special, intimate moments captured on film. Katie was incredibly responsive and accommodating from the start - on our intro call, she was warm, knowledgeable, and made everything sound so easy and exciting. I knew we would be in great hands and felt so excited and confident about working with her for our wedding. I can’t emphasize enough how Katie lived up to this and more! From timeline planning, to collaborating with our planner and other vendors, we had no worries on our wedding day because of her expertise and our trust in her. And the photos?! We absolutely love our engagement and wedding photos and so, so grateful we have so many beautiful moments captured on camera. Her photos truly captured our love and relationship, and Katie makes it all seem so effortless. She has a truly magical way of making you feel so comfortable behind the camera. My husband and I are so camera shy and feel so awkward in photos, but if you saw our engagement and wedding photos you would have no idea. Katie is truly an expert and it shows throughout the entire experience working with her – from before, during, and after, I cannot recommend her enough. Thank you so much to the Kreate team! We cannot wait to work with you again to capture future milestones in our lives.

We are so happy that we hired Katie as our wedding photographer. She is communicative, kept things running smoothly the day-of, and we were so blown away with the photos from our b...

ig day (and engagement shoot). From our first conversation, we felt that we were in capable hands with Katie; we appreciated her experience, confidence, and communication. Working with her for our engagement and wedding shoots was also a breeze! Leading up to our events, Katie was very responsive and answered all of our questions (even consulting on our wardrobe selections!); she also gave us some very helpful advice to shape our getting ready timeline. For our engagement shoot, we ended up having to go with a second-choice location due to weather, but Katie worked with the rain, and the photos turned out better than we could have imagined. On our wedding day, Katie and her second shooter Vanessa captured so many gorgeous photos that we will treasure for the rest of our lives. They selected all of the most scenic spots at our venue and captured a great variety of poses, people, and details. When selecting a wedding photographer, keep in mind you will be with them all day, and Katie is someone you will enjoy having by your side! She is fun, professional and firm yet polite when needed (when wrangling family members and bridal party!) I would recommend Katie to any friend and encourage you to contact her!

Overall extremely please with the photos, service, and communication. Highly recommend!

iend, which is especially helpful since you want to feel comfortable with the person photographing some of your most emotional moments! My bridal party raved about her all day – she knows exactly how to direct you so you look and feel comfortable and natural, and kept things running smoothly all day long (which is not easy to do with so many personalities and families to keep track of!). We just got our sneak peek photos and WOW - to say we love them is an understatement. She truly was able to capture who we are as a couple and all the emotions of the day. I would absolutely love to work with her again in the future!

iple day wedding with lots of events and she got on the phone with me, shared lots about her photography style, and then created a custom package for me that met my needs exactly. Once we had signed our contract and were going through the wedding planning process Katie’s experience and attention to detail really shone through - she was immensely helpful in making sure we had allotted all the right time for photos throughout the weekend. During the wedding weekend, she not only got the most amazing shots, but she was able to pivot on the spot as timelines changed and manage two big families at the same time. We just got our wedding photos back and they are flawless - everyone keeps telling us they are the best they’ve seen. Also, her second shooter, Molly, is fabulous! Definitely book Katie for your wedding!

Then, on the wedding day itself, Katie was efficient and professional, but at the same time she made us feel comfortable and at ease (which was no simple task that day). She very clearly knew what she was doing, and I particularly appreciated how she always took care to make sure my dress was laying nicely before snapping pictures. Then finally, maybe the most important thing: our photos are freaking gorgeous. We'd hire Katie a million times over.

I loved her comfortable, assertive vibe during planning and on the day of the event. Everyone at the wedding was so impressed by her. Then, when we got the photos, oh man.

r first conversation, Katie made us feel so comfortable with the wedding process and photography. After securing a venue, Katie was the next vendor we booked. We spoke with a few other options but no one was as organized and professional as Katie was nor had as high quality photos. Katie's experience is evident in her whole process, from her communications, tips and tricks, efficiency, and style, she is on top of this wedding thing. We did an engagement mini-session which was about an hour and in that short time frame, she captured some gorgeous photos of us that represent us as a couple. The day of the wedding, Katie and her assistant Sarah were so lovely and organized, they made the day go so smoothly. We also heard from friends and family who were impressed with how on top of everything she was (and one ended up hiring her for their daughter's wedding this year)! The photographs themselves are STUNNING. There's all the usual couple, family, bridal party, and ceremony photos which we will treasure for the rest of our lives. There's also some amazing and intimate shots of us during "golden hour" after the ceremony and at sunset. Do yourself a favor and hire Katie and get the extra hours and engagement session. It's so worth it!

the way, was quick to respond, and helped pick a location for our "first look" photos. She even met with our venue/day-of coordinator before the wedding. She sent a few "sneak peak" photos the day after our wedding so we could see some of the shots before receiving the entire album. Our digital library of photos is organized and easy to navigate. Our photos are natural and we love that she beautifully captured so many candid moments throughout the day. She also captured all of the many details that went into our wedding (the flowers and decor, alpacas, the band, etc.) so that when we look through the images, it takes us back to our wedding day and you can really feel the vibe. Both Katie and her assistant photographer Sarah were really fun and easy to work with. They made us feel relaxed and at ease, while also being very discreet during the ceremony and reception.

Katie seemed to fit into every situation, worked collaboratively with everyone (and I hadn't realized just how vital this is until my own wedding day; there are a lot of people swirling around you and it is SUPER important they are positive and each respect the other!), and she was a steady force throughout every part.
