If you're reading this, you may have decided that you're ready to propose to your partner. (Congratulations!) As you begin planning the engagement, the biggest tasks to complete are buying a ring and picking a proposal date. This presents the ultimate question: What's the best time to buy an engagement ring? 

[READ MORE Do People Still Follow the 3 Months' Salary Engagement Ring Rule? ](https://www.theknot.com/content/spending-three-months-salary-on-engagement-ring)

Selecting the perfect sparkler and purchasing it on time are equally important tasks, and their timelines are woven together. Determining when to buy an engagement ring depends on a number of factors, including the kind of bauble you want (like a pre-designed style or a bespoke design), your ideal [proposal plan](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-proposals-checklist), and the specific retailer you'd like to work with. To help determine the best time to buy an engagement ring, two jewelry experts weigh in on everything you need to know about planning your purchase _before_ you start shopping.

  * Is There a "Best Time" to Buy an Engagement Ring?
  * Best Time to Buy an Engagement Ring for Deals
  * When to Buy an Engagement Ring Before Your Proposal




## Is There a "Best Time" to Buy an Engagement Ring? 

Ultimately, the "right" time to buy an engagement ring can differ depending on a variety of factors, but it really comes down to when you want to propose. "The timing for purchasing an engagement ring all depends on the timing for the couple," says Kayla Searle, founder of [Olive Avenue Jewelry](https://www.oliveavejewelry.com/). "There is no right or wrong time to start shopping or to purchase, because the timeline of finding your dream engagement ring is different for everyone."

FEATURED VIDEO FROM THE KNOT

Generally speaking, it's best to buy an engagement ring two to four months before the intended proposal date. This number is reflected by data we gathered from The Knot 2024 Jewelry and Engagement Study. We surveyed over 7,000 couples who got engaged last year, and the vast majority of proposers—82% to be exact—said they purchased the ring four months or less before the proposal. Within that group, 60% bought the ring two months or less before the proposal. We also found that 45% of those who popped the question started dreaming up [proposal ideas](https://www.theknot.com/content/romantic-ways-to-propose) 1-3 months before it occurred. 

It's important to note that certain engagement ring styles, especially bespoke pieces, can take more time to source than a pre-designed ring. "The custom process begins with a consultation and evolves to the stone selection and designing the setting," says [Hannah Florman](https://www.hannahflorman.com/), a Boston-based private jeweler. "Most clients can expect that their [custom engagement ring](https://www.theknot.com/content/custom-engagement-ring-design-101) design could take anywhere from three weeks to eight weeks, depending on how complex the design is or if they'd like rare diamonds that need time to source demand. That said, most rings can be brought to life in about six weeks, which gives clients just enough time to plan the engagement festivities to come."

## Best Time to Buy an Engagement Ring for Deals 

While the jewelry industry doesn't necessarily have a prime purchasing season, engagement ring shopping can be affected by the holidays. If you have a strict price point and are looking to save on the [engagement ring cost](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-much-to-spend-on-engagement-ring), you might consider shopping during cyber sale weeks. Retailers don't typically offer major discounts on high-quality diamonds, but[ Black Friday engagement ring sales](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-engagement-ring-sale) are definitely something to look out for if you're hoping to save on your purchase. Although you might not find largely discounted diamond prices as you would for clothing or home appliances, you can certainly get great perks like expedited shipping, free high-quality gifts with your purchase, or discounts on additional factors of the ring style, like the setting.

Even though this time of the year can sometimes offer better prices, note that it is significantly busier for jewelry stores and private sellers. "If you're not planning on a holiday proposal, waiting until after the new year can be wise instead of getting started in November or December when jewelers are busy and inventory might be more limited, with longer lead times," says Florman. "The holiday season from October through New Years' is incredibly busy because clients are also competing for attention with those designing fine jewelry as gifts."

While shopping during the holiday rush can be a great time to buy an engagement ring if you're looking for deals or planning a festive proposal, it can also take longer to get the perfect ring. Plus, if you're envisioning a Christmas Eve or New Years' proposal, it's better to start the process earlier in the year. As an alternative, you could find similar perks with a [Valentine's Day sale on engagement rings](https://www.theknot.com/content/valentines-day-wedding-engagement-ring-sale) if you're open to purchasing at that time of year. 

## When to Buy an Engagement Ring Before Your Proposal

The best way to determine when to buy an engagement ring is to work backwards from your projected proposal date. Give yourself at least one to two months lead time for pre-designed rings, or three or more months for custom pieces. For example, if you'd like to propose on New Year's Eve, our data (paired jeweler expertise) indicates that it's best to purchase the ring in September or October. Or, if you want to propose on vacation in July, for example, consider buying the ring in April or May. 

While there isn't a steadfast formula to follow when picking the best time to buy an engagement ring, specific timing details will vary among retailers, so it's always best to check shipping timelines on the store's website or make an appointment with an experienced gemologist. After all, there's no such thing as buying an engagement ring _too_ early, especially if you'd rather have peace of mind knowing it's in your possession. (You'll just need to find a great hiding spot for it.) "Having time on your side will always feel like a great asset when you're talking about such a significant financial investment," Florman says. "The timeline of your engagement ring design will depend on your level of clarity and communication of needs and preferences along the way. Trust in the experts and you'll get a beautiful ring just in time."
