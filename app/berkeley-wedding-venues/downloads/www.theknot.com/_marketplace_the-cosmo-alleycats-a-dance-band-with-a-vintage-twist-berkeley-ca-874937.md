Cosmo Alleycats have been a favorite of the San Francisco music scene since the band’s 2010 beginning, bringing to the stage a potent mix of swing and vintage dance music with a dynamic, soulful delivery. Led by vocalist Emily Day (“one of the major singers in her field” – Scott Yanow), Cosmo Alleycats draws from several decades of exhilarating American music, along with inspired originals, to deliver a fun and engaging performance. Cosmo Alleycats have expertly crafted their sets to create the perfect vintage ambiance for ceremonies, cocktail hours, dinner receptions and dance parties. Included in the cost of booking Cosmo Alleycats is full sound systems for multiple performance locations, wireless mics for toasts, lapel mics for ceremonies, light Emceeing, and uniquely customized songs for featured dances. There is also an option to have the band DJ your party into the late night hours.

r jazz and classic standards. After that evening, we asked them if they were available to provide the music at our wedding in May 2024. Emily was a pleasure to work with in the lead-up, especially when we planned a choreographed first dance and wanted to select a special song. The band also learned the Star Wars Cantina Band song since our wedding was on May the Fourth ("Star Wars Day"). The live music was a highlight of the day, and we wish we'd had even more time with them.

Specifically - they learned Lean on Me, arranged Little Wing, covered Blackbird, and kept the dance floor going all night. During my vows I spoke about Paul Simon and a certain lyric in Graceland. Emily paid attention to this and during the dj portion played this song to end the night :) Truly they were amazing to work with, amazing all evening, and I'd 100% recommend them for anyone looking for a band.

The sound mixing was top-notch; one of our guests remarked that he couldn’t believe how much the band sounded like a studio recording performing live. Their repertoire was diverse, creating an elegant and lively atmosphere that our guests thoroughly enjoyed. The Cosmo Alleycats truly elevated our special day, and we couldn't have asked for a better musical accompaniment. We highly recommend them for any event.

She offered great insight into how to structure the evening and break up the schedule to keep our guests entertained. They were flexible when they showed up and the space at the venue wasn't exactly what they were expecting. And of course, the whole band was talented and amazing. I think it speaks volumes when the site coordinator at our venue took down the contact info for Cosmo Alleycats for his own personal reference because he was so impressed.

Simply put, the Cosmo Alley Cats, with the superbly gifted Emily Day at the helm, brought down the house at our wedding reception a month back. A trio performed beautifully during ...

the cocktail hour, and the full band presided over dinner and dancing. People young and old were on their feet, and absolutely delighted by the musical selections, the talent, the joy, the FUN! Countless guests came up to us to ask us the band's name and to share their rave reviews. Emily's flawless (and scarily glamorous) stage presence was, lucky for us, matched by her utter professionalism coordinating the event. In the months leading up to the function, Emily ably handled our questions, big and small, and was a stress-buster instead of a stress-booster. (Which, frankly, simply cannot be said for all wedding vendors.) We look forward to seeing the Cosmo Alley Cats around town! Thanks to Emily et al.

We received countless compliments from guests including requests for set lists. Logistically, Emily was so great to work with. She was super helpful in sending us a clip of their version of our first dance selection so we could practice at home. Their website is also very well designed with an extensive list of their repertoire that no other band comes close to offering. Definitely go with the Cosmo Alleycats if they're available for your date!

Emily was wonderful to work with, and was also kind enough to act as our MC, introducing us and helping keep things moving smoothly. The music itself was great; the band did a wonderful job getting everyone dancing, and the range and mix of music was so much fun. They made an already wonderful day even more special for us.

I originally contacted a few bands for pricing and availability, and promptly heard back from Noam, who invited us to see them perform at Local Edition. Once we heard them perform,...

we were confident that we had to have the Cosmo Alleycats at our wedding. Noam is a true professional and was always so helpful and prompt throughout the entire planning process. We exchanged numerous emails and phone calls, and he was always pleasant and accommodating, especially when we chose a processional/recessional song AND first-dance song that wasn't in their repertoire list. Noam performed piano during the ceremony and the whole band played during the reception. Everything was fantastic! Our guests complimented the music so much, especially Emily Day's amazing voice. Even though we had a small wedding, the dance floor was always full, and everyone had an amazing time. I can't thank the Cosmo Alleycats enough for such a special experience!

BEST BAND EVER! My husband and I got married last year in Occidental, CA. We contacted a few bands for pricing and availability but in the back of my mind I couldn't help but wish...

that I would hear back from Cosmo Alleycats that they would make our dreams come true. Sure enough Emily responded to our initial email promptly and found that they were not only available, they were willing to travel to our location, and they were within our budget. Let me make one point abundantly clear; Emily is the living, breathing, epitome of the word professionalism. In her initial email she asked to set up a call to discuss our specific music needs, hours, music genre desired, ideas, etc. We had a quick phone call which she was gracious enough to take after hours when I was off work. Following that she crafted the absolute best email I've ever seen, explicitly going through all the details and what if's, personal recommendations, variety of options, add ons, and everything I hadn't even begun to think of. We signed the contract and mailed the deposit feeling like this was the one part of our wedding we were absolutely confident about. Over the following months, Emily would occasionally check in with me to see how things were going, obtain additional details, and invite us to see them at one of their local performances. About 2 months prior to our wedding we picked our first dance song, as well as other special songs. Some of them we had our heart set were not listed in their website repertoire. I reached out to Emily and found they were more than willing to learn them. The day of, the band arrived and got themselves set up unbeknownst to me; Ithey worked with the venue owner to get situated on their own. I really appreciated that. They arrived early, were dressed in formal vintage attire and were prepared for every scenario. They provided mic's for our officiant and speakers for our outdoor ceremony. At the ceremony we had Steve play piano and he played music as guests arrived and during the cocktail hour following the ceremony. Following the cocktail hour our reception was down the road in a restaurant ballroom. Cosmo Alleycats was of course set up and prepared for our arrival, and played a few instrumental songs during dinner. Following dinner, we had the pleasure of witnessing the band in it's full awesome glory. They had even set up lights! Their performance was absolutely impeccable, their arrangements were fabulous, Emily's voice was stunning, and I was in heaven. Throughout the night (and for months afterward) our guests raved to us about their performance. You need to know that no joke, this band is incredible and the best decision you'll make about your special event. As a musician myself, I know the effort that goes in to learning new music, to hauling an electric piano across a field for set up, to making sure all band members arrive promptly, to ensuring you've got the backup speakers, mic's, batteries, etc in case of the worst, to performing for several hours on end and not getting tired....it's a lot of work and believe me they definitely earn the money they receive. It shows in every facet. Also please please please make a CD.

Emily was really easy to work with, responded quickly to our questions, and really helped us to understand the process better. Emily also acted as the “MC” at our reception and helped us to plan many of the details of how best to move the evening along. This help was really invaluable to us. Overall, the band showed up early looking awesome, they made sure everything went smooth during the reception, and they played really great music! They were great to work with and they come highly recommended!

Four different locations and they had equipment setup and ready to go before any of the guests arrived. Everyone loved the band! They were friendly and helpful the whole time. They were also very easy to work with throughout the planning process, offering suggestions or alternatives for requests that didn't make sense for their sound. Great job Alleycats!

o Alleycats from the day we first reached out to them until the last beat on our wedding has been great. Noam, the pianist & manager of the band, were in constant contact with us during the months & weeks leading up to the wedding. He was very responsive to our questions and helpful with his answers. We worked together to pick a great playlist from their large repertoire and they performed every single song with great enthusiasm and energy. If you enjoy vintage Jazz & Dance music: search no more. These guys are amazing. Moreover, if you have guests who may not be as into vintage Jazz music as you are, fear not! The way they perform and entertain will get everyone on the dance floor and keep them there. Our dance floor was packed from the beginning until the very end. Our guests kept raving about how great our band was. I cannot thank Cosmo Alleycats enough for being such a phenomenal part of our special day. Cosmo Alleycats is classy, entertaining and full of energy!

ing. They sounded so amazing, from cocktail hour till the reception and their song choice was spot on. I had so many guests come up to me after to tell me how amazing the music was! And best of all, my father, who NEVER dances, danced the whole night! He loved the music and kept coming up to me to tell me how awesome the band was. I was over the moon and so happy I hired them. Thank you Noam and co for your beautiful music!!

Noam Eisen and his group were terrific. He worked with us to edit a repertoire for our 50th Wedding Anniversary, tastefully combining several genre of music to fit our background,...

interests and the mood of the event. He started with a three piece combo at the cocktail and moved to a five piece for the main event. When he injured himself a few weeks before the event, and was unable to play piano, he brought in an excellent colleague, but still managed to attend and sing. We have used Noam before, and we recommend him highly. The 60 guests all commented favaorable on the music and the ambience.

We hired the Cosmo Alleycats for our wedding August 2016. I can’t emphasize WHAT a good decision that was. They are an incredibly talented bunch and I can’t tell you how many compl...

iments we’ve had from guests on how much fun their performance was. The lead singer, Emily Day, has an amazing voice and is an incredible performer. Noam Eisen is fantastic -- both musically and to work with. Noam provided piano music for our reception, and helped us think through set list options both for the ceremony and reception. In addition, we had a last-minute bait-and-switch related to where the band could set up at our venue, and he handled that situation with incredible professionalism and calm. We knew we didn’t have to worry about the logistics for the band -- they totally had it covered. Their wealth of experience playing at many weddings before was very helpful to us in planning our own. Also, they were incredibly generous in recording multiple versions of our first dance song for us to review before the big day. We also had a fairly traditional Jewish wedding, and they had a great selection of hora tunes. The energy for the horas was incredible. We had a mix of vintage, swing and traditional Jewish music that worked perfectly for our guests. Huge thank you to the Cosmo Alleycats for making our wedding so much fun. If you’re reading this, considering booking them, I can’t recommend them enough.

Cosmo Allycats are, hands-down, the most talented group of individuals playing music in the Bay Area. Not only does Emily's voice and style take you back to another era, but her ba...

nd plays with an excitement and vigor that you don't typically hear. We met Emily after seeing Cosmo Alleycats play at Local Edition (if you haven't seen them there, you absolutely have to experience the speak easy vibes of their shows there). Upon hearing them we decided right there and then we wanted them to play our wedding. Emily was so easy to work with and really excited about our jazz era themed wedding. She was fast to respond, thorough in her explanations, and easy to negotiate with for the package that fit our needs best. Two weeks before our wedding, we received the bad news that due to the forrest fires in Big Sur our wedding venue was no longer able to accommodate us. WHAT?!? We found another venue quickly but the set up was completely different. Without batting an eye, Emily helped us re-arrange the entire plan for music. Instead of 2 band moves, the new venue would require the band to move 4 times! Not only did Emily not charge us more for the extra work, but she worked closely with the new venue to find solutions to make our ideal scenarios play out. Day of the wedding, their performances went off without a hitch! My favorite video of the whole wedding is my husband and I dancing to their "I got a women" mash up. Our guests are still raving about the band!!! Emily even got extra into theme and had costume changes throughout the day. My guests thought she totally pulled the whole event together. With Cosmo AlleyCats, you get more than a wedding band; you get a partner in planning the most fun part of your wedding!

Emily Day and the Cosmo Alleycats were such a special edition to our wedding! They truly made the party! They are a class act, incredibly professional and amazingly talented band. ...

Great mix of songs throughout the event and very reasonably priced for the value you get. Emily was easy to work with from the beginning in order to create a plan for flow, music styles, and personal touches. I would highly recommend them!

rst off, they have some very talented musicians. The horns are TIGHT. We and our friends were dancing so hard! They have such a broad repertoire. They played a stripped down acoustic jazzy set for our reception - the drummer just had a snare and hi-hat, and then for the party they really brought out the horns, even learning a couple special songs for us (both of which they pulled of fantastically). And they nailed the hora. I can't say enough good things about this band and how special they made our wedding. Even my snobby classically-trained pianist cousin got their card because he was so impressed - and that's saying something! If you want people dancing and loosing themselves to a truly great performance by a very talented band, don't hesitate to hire the Cosmo Alleycats.

All night, our guests and friends were constantly asking me where I had found the band. They played all the music we had requested, plus added in some of their own. All selections were perfect!!! I highly recommend them, especially if you are looking for a classy, jazzy reception that everybody will remember after your wedding. They even played great versions of contemporary songs for us, and during short breaks, played great dance music to keep the atmosphere going. Great band, class act from top to bottom. Also, be sure to get the full 6-piece band with the trumpet player, it makes a world of difference!

The Cosmo Alleycats Band made our wedding amazing. I can’t praise them enough! Every single guest we have spoken to has commented on what an incredible, fun, and fabulous band they...

are. Instead of having to lure people to the dance floor, we couldn’t keep them away. They are a top notch, professional and delightful band, and I wholeheartedly recommend them to anyone who wants to make their special event even more special. Working with Noam in the planning stages was a delight. He was responsive to our every request and so we got a set list that was literally made for us, including a Jewish hora, 40’s swing, and contemporary dance music. During the actual event, they were attuned to what was happening in the moment, and so their music and participation was really a part of the flow of the wedding, rather than an adjunct. Noam even agreed to play the piano during the ceremony at our synagogue, prior to the actual reception, and played Hebrew melodies that beautifully complemented our wedding ceremony. I only wish we had another event to plan so we could hire them again. Do yourself and your guests a big favor and go for the Cosmo Alleycats band.

Hiring the Cosmo Alleycats for our wedding was seriously one of the best decisions we made. I found out about this band through research online, as we were getting married in Napa ...

and I knew I wanted a jazzy styled band with female vocals. To my surprise, it was difficult to find a quality sound, and after weeks of research, it was clear that the Cosmo Alleycats were in a class above the rest. However, I was worried that working with musicians would be difficult, as I have planned events in the past and have had trouble in this department. Well, from the moment I sent an email to inquire about their services, I was met with professionalism, friendliness, and great service. Planning a destination wedding in CA from NYC on your own isn't an easy task, and I mainly worked with Emily Day, who is the lead singer of the band. She made this experience so easy for me and was always available to answer questions and give advice. There was never one moment I didn't trust her capabilities and she was so wonderful that I can easily say that working with her was an absolute pleasure. I personally used to be a DJ and had gone to audio engineering school, so music is really really REALLY important to me. When envisioning my wedding I wanted the music to be a huge highlight of the day and I knew exactly what songs I wanted played during the ceremony. Then for the reception, I wanted a mix of old and new tunes- played in that fun jazzy style for our guests to enjoy. The Cosmo Alleycats really know how to deliver! Emily worked with me to ensure we had the ceremony of our dreams. We even had one of our friends sing during the service, and Emily was happy to work with her before we arrived in CA and even before the wedding day. On the day of the wedding, we had some unforeseen hiccups that had caused our timeline to be thrown off. Luckily, the Cosmo Alleycats were ready for anything and this did not effect their performance in any way. Emily was there to communicate with me the whole time and made sure everything worked out great. One of the most important features of the band is that they played our 1st dance song perfectly. We had rehearsed a dance over 8 weeks that was perfectly choreographed to the song, "That's All" by Sarah Vaughn. I needed the band to play the song in the exact style that was made by Sarah Vaughn. They executed this feat perfectly- the timing, the style, the sound, was exact and dare I say- even better than the original. We were able to pull off our 1st dance and all our guests kept remarking on how great they were and how special it was to have our 1st danced played live. It is one of my favorite memories of the night. :) I can't say enough nice things about this band. Throughout the night, at the reception, you could feel the positive energy from this band. They aren't just skilled musicians, and excellent performers, they are just all around awesome people who love what they do and are amazing at it. This band added so much to our wedding, we were so lucky to find them and I can't recommend them enough. Just brilliant, a class above the rest, and I will be a fan for life. <3

d they do our wedding, but since it was in LA, they made arrangements to get this whole band down there! They were so professional and easy to deal with. But most important was the music. MUSIC WAS UNBELIEVABLE! Everyone at the party said they had never heard music at a wedding that was so good. Emily, the singer is amazing (and beautiful). They played jazz, latin, Jewish (Jewish wedding), Motown and other music. They were just so, so good. I cannot recommend them enough.

y. Emily's voice is one of the best you will ever hear. Period. Many guests said this was the best wedding music they ever heard. They picked songs to be played for the most part - both the ceremony and the party - and it was better than if we would be picking them. The first dance song was new for them but they learned and performed it marvelously. In terms of logistics - the easiest people to deal with. Just plain nice, happy, and kind people you actually love to have at your wedding. We can't thank them enough.

er searching the internet, we felt The Cosmo Alleycats would be a great fit. Both sets of parents were worried about a live band and thought no one would dance or enjoy it. Boy, were they wrong. I have no idea how much my guests enjoyed the food at our wedding or the cupcakes or the decorations. However, guests came up to me during the reception and after telling me how amazing it was because of The Cosmo Alleycats. My sister mentioned wanting them at her wedding. Our officiant took their business card. Everyone danced and enjoyed themselves. Emily's voice is amazing and the rest of the band matches her excellence.

The Cosmo Alleycats exceeded our expectations through the entire process, from our initial contact through the last song at our reception. Emily was so helpful and quick to respond to emails. The band also learned a couple songs that we requested (including one that required an Irish accent…thanks, Noam!). Emily and Noam worked closely with the venue manager to coordinate the timing of the music with the other events (dinner, dances, bouquet toss, cake cutting), and kept things moving along smoothly. We’re so glad we were able to have the Cosmo Alleycats play at our reception! It was the perfect way to celebrate a wonderful day!

I can only image how awesome they'd be at a venue with no noise limitation and her fantastic voice at high volume! Emily was super organized and put my mind at ease come wedding day. She was so generous with her time, to the point of walking me through how my own processional would go! Highly recommend.

If there were places here for 10 stars we would give them an 11+. The Cosmo Alley Cats made our event even more special than we could have ever imagined. I majored in Music in ...

college so the music was a HUGE deal to me at our wedding. We looked at a few different swing/jazz bands in the SF area and once we found The Cosmo Alley Cats we knew we had found the right band. At each performance, including our wedding, their music was spot on. The band has great musicians who know how to play their instrument very well and they all play very well together as a whole (in musical terms I would say their "right in the pocket"). To us it was important to hire a band with an excellent vocalist. We got that and even more with The Cosmo Alley Cat's vocalist Emily Day. Emily Day lead the band so well throughout all their songs! The bands quality of music for our event was even more than I had expected, we were very impressed. We had our reception at The Old Whaling Station (also a great venue) in Monterey California in Mid September. At this venue they had a few rules on how loud the music could be and at what time the music had to end. The Cosmo Alley Cats worked very well attending to these rules and we had no problem with the venue. Overall we loved this band. Their band leader Emily Day was attentive to our needs and made thoughtful suggestions to what she thought we needed at our wedding. Emily was quick in her responses and tried hard to make our day perfect. I would recommend The Cosmo Alley Cats to any couple who wants everyone to have fun at their wedding. The dance floor was never empty at our wedding and during the cocktail hour The Cosmo Alley Cats were spot on with every song they played. Their music selection was perfect for our event! We are so happy we chose The Cosmo Alley Cats for our wedding! Thank you Cosmo Alley Cats for making our wedding the even more perfect than what we had expected.
