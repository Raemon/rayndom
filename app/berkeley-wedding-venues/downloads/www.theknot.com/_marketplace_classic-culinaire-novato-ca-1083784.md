I worked with Classic Culinaire for a wedding in Mill Valley, and they were fantastic from start to finish. Rachael, the event manager, was incredibly supportive throughout the pla...

nning process—always quick to respond, patient with questions, and generous with her advice to help the couple make the best decisions. On the wedding day, the team arrived on time, managed both the catering and bar smoothly, and were a huge help with setup and cleanup. They were flexible, friendly, and worked seamlessly alongside our vendor team. I’d be thrilled to partner with them again for future events!

n, and attention to detail. We had 70 guests for our May wedding with several gluten free and vegan needs, and they were so happy to accommodate and make the whole planning process so easy. Everything went seamlessly, and on top of it their food is absolutely incredible! We had so many guests comment on how amazing the food was, and some of our guests are even in the restaurant industry so that was a very big compliment. We will absolutely be recommending them to all of our friends and family!

I can't rave enough about Classic Culinaire, Chef Chad, and Rachael. The salad presentation was to die for. The halibut, which we actually didn't taste during our tasting (we taste...

d the salmon and took a chance on the halibut) was TO DIE FOR. My guests are still raving about the food. Chef Chad put together a caviar platter on each table that was just amazing. Additionally, I had vegan guests, gluten free guests, and kosher guests. With each dietary restriction Chef Chad took it in stride and executed brilliantly (and so tasty). All my guests could eat at my wedding feeling comfortable with their own personal restrictions. Rachael was so lovely to work with, and worked with our coordinator to execute day of beautifully. Everything was seamless to my eyes. The Classic Culinaire team cannot be beat. At the end when there were some missing rental items, Rachael at Classic Culinaire stepped up to solve the issue with me, and everything ended on such a good note. I encourage you to contact Classic Culinaire. From initial tasting to day of event, this was an amazing experience.

The most important thing for us at our wedding was to make sure we had GOOD FOOD! Actual good food, not just "wedding-level" good (if you know, you know). From the moment we met ...

Rachael and Chef Chad, we had a great feeling about working with them. And frankly, we were blown away by our entire experience. If you are booking a caterer for a wedding, or any event, we could not recommend Classic Culinaire more highly. It is the RIGHT decision. We knew the food was super good, and it was a bigger testament when our guests came up to us for weeks after the wedding commenting on how good the food was. We had guests going up for seconds and thirds! We had several guests ask us to ask the chef what the recipe was for certain dishes at dinner! To rewind, we went in for our tasting, Rachael graciously explained the process to us. Chef Chad came out at the end of our dishes, and asked for feedback on each dish. More seasoning? Less garlic? More lemon? What Chef does that?! Most chefs we've interacted with have their way of preparing each dish, because they're professional and do their dishes for a living. Chef Chad had enough confidence in how good his dishes tasted, and he really cared to make the food taste exactly to our liking. We even wanted to do a Philly Cheesesteak as a late night meal at our wedding, and he created one even though it was not on his normal menu. It was delicious. Rachael is such a pleasure to work with. She is beyond helpful at every juncture in the planning process and even helped with our many questions around staffing, rentals, table arrangements and beyond. She was a source of peace and a calming presence during the whole planning process and especially on the day of the wedding. All this to say, I could not recommend this team of all-stars enough!

We hired Classic Culinaire for our 90 person wedding, and they did a phenomenal job! We discovered Classic Culinaire through our wedding venue’s list of approved caterers, and were...

quickly impressed by their responsiveness, extensive menu, price point, and flexible services. We wanted to put together a primarily vegetarian menu, with vegan and gluten-free options to accommodate some of our guests’ dietary restrictions, and Chef Chad happily adjusted the menu for us (e.g. substituting gluten free pasta, serving some plated salads without cheese, providing dietary signs for all sides and entrées). All of our communications with Rachael were smooth, from putting together a quote, scheduling a tasting (delicious!), and finalizing details with us leading up to the wedding. Our reception was seamless, and we received so many compliments from our guests about the food, especially the beautiful salad, the incredible mushroom risotto cakes, and the moist salmon. Rachael’s staff kindly prepared specialty drinks, appetizer plates, and entrées for my partner and I so we could spend more of our cocktail hour and reception socializing with our guests. And at the end of the evening, Rachael’s staff boxed up the few remaining leftovers for us as a special treat for the next couple days. We loved working with Classic Culinaire, and happily recommend the whole team for your catering needs!

Classic Culinaire was on our venue's list of recommended caterers, and they certainly exceeded our expectations. The variety of options to choose from for our menu was superb, and ...

we ended up with an almost fully vegetarian-friendly menu by happenstance. Chef Chad was also very amenable to making small changes/adjustments to the dishes, though they were so delicious as-is, there was very little we wanted to change. We received so many compliments on our wedding dinner; one of the bridesmaids said she wanted to eat nothing but the salad and pasta we'd chosen forever. Rachael and the staff who worked on our wedding day were also very professional and friendly, and they ensured everything ran smoothly. I would absolutely hire Classic Culinaire for a future event.

ood at our wedding was one of our top priorities. My husband and quite a few of our guests have dietary restrictions, and we wanted to make sure everyone felt taken care of. Rachael and the whole team were all so incredibly thoughtful and accommodating for us. We did a tasting before we signed our contract with them - the service was impeccable and the food was amazing. The food on the day of the wedding was absolutely amazing, and so many of our guests said as much. We loved working with Rachael and the whole team!

We felt really good about working with Classic Culinaire. They were responsive and amenable to our various needs, including having an all vegetarian menu and making many of their m...

enu items available in a vegan option. They also were highly experienced at working with our venue, Marin Art and Garden Center, and made coordination extremely smooth. People were enthusiastic about the food and no one complained about it being veggie, which I would take to mean people were plenty satisfied with the food that was served. I would use Classic Culinaire again.

avors. These guys are the best and we were so fortunate to have them cater our wedding. Chad and Marcus made themselves available to us as often as we needed them during the lead up to our big day, they handled the rentals, coordinated with the venue and the wedding planner, and helped us pull off a wedding that our guests will be talking about for years (and they'll be talking about the charcuterie board for the rest of their lives!!).

h Chad we knew that he would give his all to make sure our dreams for the "Big Day" would come true. His attention to detail and yummy flavor combinations are certainly what closed the deal for us. His ability to take the items we enjoy most and turn them into decadent dishes is an ability one does not find often. Chef Chad did an excellent job to ensure that the recipes for and presentation of all dishes were flawless. The team that Chef Chad brought with him were professional and courteous, a real treat to include in such a special day. Everything Classic Culinaire served was wonderful and artfully thought out for this Bride and Groom. Their range of abilities are remarkable and we found that each dish prepared was better than anticipated. Chef Chad helped to make our wedding day MORE than I could have hoped for and I am positive he can do the same for you!!!

g the way as I requested. The food they provided was phenomenal. The appetizers passed out were loved by all of the guests. The dinner provided was even better. Each plate tasted like it had been made especially for each guest. The halibut served was cooked perfectly and the salad served complimented it. The entire staff of Classic Culinaire was a pleasure to work with. It was really nice to not have to worry about the food on my big day. I would HIGHLY recommend them for any wedding event.

Do yourself a favor and hire Chad and his team! You will not be disappointed. In fact, he may even exceed your expectations! We hired Classic Culinaire for our small wedding of 25 ...

people. The food was so delicious, the service outstanding, and the punctuality was on point. Chad and his team were so friendly and warm, I felt like they fit right into our small event. We chose not to do a tasting prior because it was hard to get the time off work. Based on his many stellar reviews, we decided to put full trust into Chad, and it was the right thing to do. He really delivered on the flavor and helped make our wedding so special. His team even helped set up the cake and brought it to us for cutting so we didn't have to worry about timing. And while I was expecting to pay more to have a plated meal by a personal chef, his price was so on point, we could not have been more thrilled. If we did it all over again, we would not have changed a thing. The food, price, and service really exceeded our expectations. We still have friends and family talking about how wonderful the food and service were. We feel so grateful to Chad and his team.
