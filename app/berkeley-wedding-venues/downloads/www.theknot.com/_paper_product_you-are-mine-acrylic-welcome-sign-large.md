Details

A heartfelt message welcoming guests appears in a flowing script at a slightly angled tilt on these elegant welcome signs. Your details, including names, wedding date, and event location are neatly arranged along the bottom right-hand corner of the design. A solid background provides a clean backdrop that keeps the focus on the typography and personalized details. **Materials** Our wedding signs are available in a curated selection of materials designed to complement your setting, from grand entrances to intimate tabletops. Each option is thoughtfully selected for its visual impact, ease of use, and styling versatility.  
**Indoor Foam Core** Smooth and lightweight, foam core is ideal for indoor use where ease and elegance meet. It’s a great option for welcome signs, seating charts, and other easel displays.  
**Outdoor Corrugated** Made from white corrugated plastic and built to withstand the elements, this option is perfect for outdoor signage. Each sign includes an aluminum metal H-stake for easy setup in grass or soil   
**Plastic** A smooth, sturdy material ideal for tabletop signage. Designed to be freestanding, lightweight, and easy to reposition—perfect for dynamic displays like bars, counters, or dessert tables.  
**Acrylic** Minimal and modern, acrylic brings an elevated transparency to any display. Each sign arrives with a protective film to keep it scratch-free until you're ready to style.
