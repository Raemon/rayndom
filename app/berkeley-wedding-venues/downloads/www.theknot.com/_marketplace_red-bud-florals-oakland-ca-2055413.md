thy and skilled. We had a modest budget and she came up with great ideas to repurpose flowers and make it work for our vision and budget. I told her my ideas and what sort of things I liked and she came up with the most beautiful bouquets and floral arrangements which far exceeded my expectations. I had a wildflower bridal bouquet, wild flowers for my hair, 2 bridesmaids bouquets, buttonholes for the men, wildflowers in assorted vases on the tables, a display around the wedding ceremony location. Tami completely delivered, highly recommend. Thank you so so much for doing such an amazing job.

Tami at Red Bud Florals was an excellent person to work with for our wedding day. She over-delivered on everything we asked for. I remember the moment I received my wedding bouquet...

and was gobsmacked by how beautiful it was. She didn’t have anything that was exactly our vision in her samples, so I wasn’t sure how it was going to come out. However, she took all of the sample pictures that we had given her and all of our input and really manifested it into our dream florals better than we could’ve done ourselves. I really couldn’t recommend her more highly.

hat you are looking for, and for us she quickly got a gist of our style. She suggested some things we would not have thought of, and she made the most beautiful arrangements EVER that really just beautified our whole event. She also worked with our price range, and was respectful of it the entire time--not pushing for more. She is more than reliable, and so trustworthy. She was culturally sensitive as well, which we needed vendors for our wedding to be, and she was really fun to talk to. Seriously Tami is the sweetest, and is so so so so so skilled at what she does. She made me appreciate flowers more, and made me see how they can actually really really beautify a space. Honestly her arrangements were some of the most beautiful I'd ever seen--elegant and sophisticated too. She was punctual and had things all set up by the time we arrived, so in this sense was super duper reliable and made the whole process smooth and easy. She was also extremely communicative which was really great too. I would hire her again in a heartbeat!

lowers and eucalyptus. I started small by just ordering a bouquet. Our wedding was in a beautiful outside space so we didn't think we needed much in way of flowers. Also, we're on a tight budget and the florists I called before had outrageous prices so I didn't think it was an option. But Tami's vision was elegant and surprisingly affordable and she handled EVERYTHING! Which was huge bc the wedding date was closing in and I was so busy with work and planning. I was literally texting her with changes and add-ons up until a few days before and she was so responsive and accommodating. When my plan for the centerpieces fell apart she proposed glass bowls of water with beargrass, gardenias, and floating candles. They looked fantastic and I got so many compliments on "my" sophisticated taste lol. I really wish I could post photos here so you can see. Thank you so much, Tami!
