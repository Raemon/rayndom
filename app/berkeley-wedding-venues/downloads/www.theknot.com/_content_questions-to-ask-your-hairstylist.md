One of the most challenging tasks when planning a wedding is picking the right vendors for your big day, and that includes your wedding hairstylist. But where do you find a hairdresser who does wedding hair? How much do you need to budget? How do you even choose a hair salon for your wedding? Doing some research can go a long way when narrowing down potential vendors. To help get you started, we tapped Chyenne Velez, owner and expert hairstylist at [Lé Brunette & Co.](https://lebrunetteco.com/) in East Meadow, New York, to answer your questions about how to hire your dream wedding hair professional.

Once you've found your perfect match, there are a few questions you'll want to ask before you sign on the dotted line, and that's where we come in. Asking these questions is important to ensure that you and your wedding hairdresser are on the same page and that there are no unwanted surprises on the big day. Below, we've created a list of must-ask questions to ask hair vendors during your wedding consultation, like "_Do you have a portfolio of your work?_ " and Q's you may not have even thought of, like "_What happens if you get sick on my wedding day?_ "

  * When should you hire a hairdresser for your wedding?
  * Should you and your wedding party get your hair done together?
  * How much should you budget for wedding hair?

  * What questions should you ask at your wedding hair consultation?





## Are wedding hairstylists different from regular hairstylists?

Yes, wedding stylists and regular hairstylists do differ in their expertise and services. "A bridal hairstylist has specific training in formal styling as well as techniques that are meant to make the hair last for long periods of time," says Velez. "Bridal hairstylists have the best knowledge of the venues, photographer protocols, creating timelines, and so on." However, Velez says it's important to keep your normal hairdresser in the loop when planning your wedding hair. "It is still very important for the bride to consult with a hairdresser for her everyday hair maintenance in order to have beautiful, healthy hair leading up to the wedding day."

## When should you hire a hairdresser for your wedding?

You should hire your wedding hairstylist [as soon as possible](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-beauty-skincare-timeline), especially if you have a specific bridal hairstylist in mind. "I would suggest the bride reach out as soon as she has a date or as soon as the hairdressers' books are open for the desired date," says Velez. "Believe it or not, I'm booking out one and a half to two years in advance for brides, and most likely so are all your other favorite vendors."

## Should you and your wedding party get your hair done together?

Though not essential, getting your hair done with your wedding party is a great way to celebrate and spend time together before the ceremony starts. Depending on how many attendants you have, your stylist can likely add additional wedding party hairstylists to their team for some extra hands. However, determining who should foot the bill when it comes to hairstylists for the wedding party isn't always black and white. To help you navigate these expenses, check out our cost breakdown of [who pays for bridal party hair and makeup](https://www.theknot.com/content/who-pays-for-bridesmaid-hair-makeup#:~:text=%22The%20bride%20should%20cover%20the,and%20makeup%20for%20their%20crew.).

### Find all the vendors you need

Discover top-rated pros for any budget, background and style.

## How much should you budget for wedding hair?

You should budget at least $150 for your wedding hair, based on the findings from the [The Knot 2023 Real Weddings Study](https://www.theknot.com/content/average-cost-wedding-hair-makeup). Keep in mind this number is an average, and pricing will vary depending on where you're located and the exact services you require. "Some outside costs that may be overlooked are items like clip-in extensions, which are a very popular option for brides," says Velez. "Another expense that is often overlooked is adding on a touch-up or second hairstyle for the bride. After a long day, a touch-up or hair change after cocktail hour is such a great way to ensure the bride is fresh and comfortable to greet her guests at the reception." 

## Do you need to choose a wedding hairstyle before booking a stylist?

No, you don't need to decide on your wedding hairstyle before booking your stylist. "I believe the bride should find a bridal hairstylist who has great work and is also someone they connect well with," says Velez. "Finding and creating a hairstyle is the easy part, but in my experience, most brides are very unsure of their desired hairstyle until they find their dress." This means that now is the perfect time to get inspired by recent [hair trends](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-hair-trends), save them on Pinterest and look into what your desired looks require, like [extensions](https://www.theknot.com/content/types-of-hair-extensions) or [hair accessories](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-hair-accessories).

"As the bridal stylist, we will guide the bride to try hairstyles that complement the dress and, most importantly, their face," Velez explains. "The bride should feel like themselves, but elevated."

## How can you find a wedding hairstylist or salon near you?

The easiest way to find a wedding hairstylist near you? Browse [The Knot Vendor Marketplace](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/beauty-services), where you can filter the results by location, service type and more. Plus, reading reviews helps you easily find someone that you'll really connect with.

## What questions should you ask at your wedding hair consultation?

It can be easy to feel confident in hiring a certain hairstylist for your wedding party based on their website and Instagram alone. But before you commit, it's important to ask your potential wedding hairstylist about their pricing, travel requirements and references. Here are some key bridal hair consultation questions to ask to ensure you've found the right stylist for you. Trust us, you'll be glad you asked.

![Top questions to ask your wedding hairstylist](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/1f508c73-d498-427f-8a71-c5fa112088d9~rs_768.h)

### 1\. Do you have a portfolio of your work?

**Why you need to know:** Seeing a hairstylist's portfolio will give you a better idea of how they work and style hair, especially if you want to book a bridal hairstylist who has experience working with different hair textures and lengths. It'll give you a good idea of whether or not the hairstylist can help you achieve your dream wedding day 'do.

### **2\. Do you have a list of references?**

**Why you need to know:** While looking at a wedding hairstylist's portfolio is essential for gauging their expertise, don't skip over client feedback to get the inside scoop on their timeliness, attitude and professionalism. Start by checking out [our marketplace](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/beauty-services) to get the 4-1-1 on what it's like to work with them. Here, you'll find star ratings and reviews from previous clients that can help you decide next steps.

### **3\. Will you bring your own products (a blow dryer, a curling iron and other necessities), or will I be responsible for supplying them?**

**Why you need to know:** Most hairstylists for weddings will bring a kit with all the essentials they need to style your tresses. But if they do require that you provide a specific product, you'll want to know early on (especially if that's a deal breaker). If you prefer to use your own tools and products, communicate this with your hairstylist to see if they're game.

### 4\. How do you charge—by the hour or per person?

**Why you need to know:** Every hairstylist prices their work a bit differently. Before you sign a contract, have a clear understanding of the packages they may offer and what's included in each one. You'll also want to know how they would like to be paid. Cash tends to be the popular choice for beauty pros but more individual vendors are starting to take credit cards. PayPal and Venmo are also options you might want to ask about. The more you know about the logistics of paying them ahead of time, the smoother the day will be.

### 5\. Will I have to travel to a salon or do you work on-site?

**Why you need to know:** Not all hairstylists will work on-site—some may ask you to [travel to their salon](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-day-hair-salon-vs-hotel) or studio. You should consider the distance between the salon and where you'll be getting dressed to determine if it'll work into your [wedding day schedule](https://www.theknot.com/content/sample-wedding-weekend-timelines). No one wants to feel rushed the morning of their big day.

### 6\. How many weddings do you do in one day? (Will mine be the only one, or will you have to get to another wedding or event?)

**Why you need to know:** Ask your stylist how many weddings they do per day in advance, because this could be a deal breaker. If your stylist is only preparing your hair for the ceremony, it might not be a problem if they're working multiple weddings in one day. But if you want your hairstylist on deck for the ceremony and the reception, make sure they're available to block out the whole day just for you (and don't forget to ask what the extra fee will be).

### 7\. Will you do a trial run before the wedding?

**Why you need to know:** Chances are the [hair trial](https://www.theknot.com/content/prep-for-hair-and-makeup-trial) will be your first time assessing their skills in person. Provide them with reference images and bring any bridal hair accessories you plan to wear on your wedding day. Editor's note: Before you schedule your trial, be sure to find out if they charge extra for the service.

### 8\. Do you have a team of assistants, or will you be the only stylist that day?

**Why you need to know:** If your bridal party is also getting their hair done, look for a stylist who has an assistant or two. The assistants can work on your bridal party at the same time your preferred stylist is getting you aisle-ready. This will also cut your prep time in half and ensure no one feels rushed the morning of.

### 9\. How long will my hairstyle take?

**Why you need to know:** Knowing the prep time will help you manage your day. Don't forget to account for your bridal party as well. Your hair will take the longest, so give yourself at least an hour to two hours with your hairstylist and at least one hour for each bridesmaid. As the bride, you should also be the last person to have your hair done so that it's freshly styled.

### 10\. What will happen if you're ill or have an emergency on the wedding day?

**Why you need to know:** This may be last on the list of wedding hair consultation questions to ask, but it's _so_ important. If your hairstylist has to cancel on short notice, there should be a contingency plan. Will they provide another stylist, a refund or have their assistant take their place? If they have a backup hairstylist for your wedding, make sure to meet them beforehand.
