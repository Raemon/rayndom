Picking out save-the-dates is often one of the first steps of wedding planning. After the date is set or the venue is reserved, it's time to let friends and family know. Save-the-date postcards are a popular (and often more cost-effective) way to do just that. Not only do they cost less, but postcards also require less postage than a regular letter. 

They're also a bit more sustainable (less paper means less waste) and are ready-made to be put in a place of honor on the fridge. And while the formal wedding invitation needs to include more information, the relevant details for a save-the-date can fit easily onto a postcard. Typically, there is also room to jot down a little note or sign it to add even more personalization. 

## 20 Save-the-Date Postcards

Save-the-date postcards from [The Knot Invitations](https://www.theknot.com/paper/save-the-dates/save-the-date-postcards) are also part of a larger [stationery suite](https://www.theknot.com/content/complete-wedding-invitations-checklist), which allows you to carry the theme through the wedding itself and even into the wedding announcements and [thank-you cards](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-thank-you-note). Of course, if you just want to choose a pretty template for now and pick a different stationery suite down the line, that's fine too. Ahead, check out 20 save-the-date postcards for your upcoming wedding.
