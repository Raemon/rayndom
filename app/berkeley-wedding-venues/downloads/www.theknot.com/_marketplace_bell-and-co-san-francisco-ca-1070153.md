looking sharp, and sounded even better. If you're looking for real musicians who bring both skill and style, look no further. They created the perfect elevated vibe in the sunshine and were hands down the best part of the day.

I am soooo late in submitting this review of a band I never could have imagined I would have at my wedding. I did not know much about them, but then I spoke to both Jay (JSP) and C...

lay (lead) and felt so very reassured. They handles ceremony, cocktail hour, dinner and the party with such an elegance and class. This was all a very first class experience and a true highlight of our extraordinarily dreamy wedding. Please check with your planner, venue and others -- all you will hear are raves. Thank you to the Clay Bell team!

A delight to work with! Well before my event, Clay reached out to me to ask questions about my event (things I hadn't thought of like guests in attendance, song requests, songs I d...

idn't want to hear) and checked in with me the day before the event to see if I had any questions. Day of the event it seemed like he curated his set list specifically to me! They played it all: rock, pop, folk, country... you name it they played (all acoustically too!) I would hire them again in a heartbeat.

A huge thank you to Bell & Company and Pop Rocks for making our day so very special day. It was a perfect combination to have both bands at our wedding. Bell & Co did both the c...

eremony and cocktail hour for a classic wedding feel and beautiful vibes as the sun set. After dinner, Pop Rocks came in full blast for the reception and kept everyone dancing until the end of the night with an amazing set of tunes from Motown to now. Every single musical moment was dreamy. Thrilled!

ay at our friends wedding. I could not have planned a better playlist from start to finish. Bell & Co had the party on the dance floor from start to finish playing slow jams, dance tunes, jazz standards and even an old time folk song for my mother in law. If I had to get married again I would want Bell & Co there.

We were a relatively small group of ‘intentional’ family, gathered for a most special afternoon and evening. What Clay brought was well beyond what we could have hoped for...........

sweet sound, soulful presentation and a loving spirit......all while playing the most beautiful and eclectic playlist. The very best one could ask for, 5 stars and beyond!
