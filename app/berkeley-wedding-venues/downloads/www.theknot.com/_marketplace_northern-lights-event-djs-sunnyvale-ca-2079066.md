Based in Sunnyvale, CA, Northern Lights Event DJs is a skilled wedding DJ who can elevate your next event. Since 2021, I've worked with dozens of couples to make their special day SPECIAL to them - customizing playlists for cocktails, entrances, dinner, and dancing; doing custom song edits; even helping one couple to Rick Roll their guests! You want your wedding to be as unique as you and your partner are, so don't settle for someone just going through the motions. I make sure to schedule a call or sit down with every client to go over the details and find out what's important to them. My rates are low. That's because I want to wow you. While I cut my teeth working for another company (for whom I'm forever grateful), my own business started in 2023. My goal is to create a lasting, memorable experience for you and your partner, earn a great review, and grow my business from there. I do believe that the wedding industry is all about service, relationships, and word-of-mouth referrals. I'm a wedding DJ, not a club DJ, so event services are part of my DNA. I can do any amount of emceeing you're looking for, facilitate transitions and entrances, and keep things flowing. As a musician, I'm all about giving you an authentic performance and matching songs by tempo, key, and style. Some wedding DJs just press play, but I'm a stickler for high-quality sound and a professional touch. As an MC and event facilitator, I'm comfortable on the microphone in front of as few as 10 people to as many as several thousand. Feel free to contact me with any questions you might have. I look forward to being of service to you. About Rob: Rob has been a professional wedding and event DJ for over four years and a professional musician and event facilitator for over 10 years. Some of his performances include Irving Plaza, New York City; CBGB, New York City; Great American Music Hall, San Francisco; The Webster Theater, Hartford, CT; Sacramento County Fair, Sacramento, CA; and Sun Valley Resort, Ketchum, ID. He has facilitated team-building events for companies including Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, HBO, and Maybelline. Rob currently works as a public school music teacher, band and orchestra director, and teaches private music lessons. He also works occasionally as a wedding officiant.

Working with Rob was one of the best decisions we made for our wedding. He was incredibly organized and essentially helped us build out our entire wedding timeline. As first-time w...

edding attendees (let alone planners), we had no idea where to start — but Rob guided us through every step with professionalism, patience, and kindness. In the months leading up to the wedding, Rob was always present, deeply experienced, and super detail-oriented — his steady presence in the months leading up to the big day gave us a lot of much needed reassurance. We ended up changing our plans probably around 10 times the week leading up to the wedding, and despite that, Rob handled every adjustment with understanding and enthusiasm. Above all, he is just a genuinely warm, thoughtful person who consistently went above and beyond. Thank you, Rob, for making our wedding such a memorable and joyful experience!!

Summary: If you're looking for a great DJ that is dependable, creative, easy to work with, and goes the extra mile, Rob (Northern Lights) is the DJ for you. He was one of 6 vendor...

s for our 60 person wedding and certainly the most memorable with the most impact for the best of reasons. Planning with Rob: Rob was super responsive and always made sure he was available. He took the time to understand the timeline of the day and even had his own template to make sure specific music and announcements are made at the right time. As a couple that was new to the wedding scene, this was extremely helpful for us. It was the first time we were forced to really think of the details about our special day and when it all started to come together. We changed our schedule the week of the wedding and he was super flexible and responsive to our changes. He also made sure he pronounced our bridal party and parents' names correctly which we greatly appreciated. Experience During the Wedding: Our wedding was different in that we did not have a day of coordinator and we were leaning on Rob to help us keep the flow going and not let us fall to far behind. On the day of, he definitely helped keep us organized and would go look for us to make sure we were ready to proceed to the next part of the wedding. He had all the equipment to set up for two spaces at our outdoor venue: 1) ceremony and 2) dinner/reception area. He made all of the announcements to let our guests know what was going on and when they needed to move to other areas of the venue. We ended up having to deviate from the original plan quite a bit because of slow catering and the photographers insisting on a different time to shoot our pictures than we had originally planned. Rob just kept it rolling without an issue. Music: The sound quality was great; It felt like a concert. The transitions were so smooth and perfect. There were several segments we worked with Rob in advance to blend and trim. Each time we'd let him know what our vision was and he'd send over 2 or 3 options for us to choose from and was still open to additional feedback (although he understood our vision every time so it was usually as easy as selecting our favorite version of it). He also let us customize the set for different parts of the wedding, e.g. guests arrival, ceremony, cocktail hour, dinner, and dance.
