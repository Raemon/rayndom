tting compliments from my guests. Its hard not to sound cliche in this review - but it is true. Living in Southern California - there are tons of wedding band options to chose from. But, OTBMA made our day absolutely perfect. I spent way too many hours looking for the perfect bad, watching videos on line, reading reviews, getting references, and when we finally decided to take the plunge with OTBMA and work with Rob Perkins and his team - I can say it was one the best decisions we made during the wedding planing process. The wedding was in Palm Springs and everything was flawless, from the epic performances at cocktail hour and the reception and the ceremony to the logistics and Audio equipment for the entire day. OTBMA and Rob really cared about what me and my fiancé and my family wanted at our wedding. I know it sounds cliche, but they really did, and they were also experienced enough to tell us what was realistic and what wasn't while at the same time really tying to make what we wanted happen. They were able to work with and manage all of our requests with such grace and kindness and we really became a team - they were what brides dream of before and during the big day. I can't thank them enough making our dreams come true in the planning stages and the during the wedding, as well as really connecting with us and our friends.

We shared countless emails which were always responded to in a timely manner. On the wedding day they showed up on time, set everything up, came and spoke with me briefly about a few final details and everything was spot on. The vocals were out of this world and I swear our dance floor was packed the entirety of the night! They play all the right songs at all the right times and kept the energy bumpin! We got nothing but positive feedback from our guests regarding the band, most of them saying it was the best wedding band they've ever seen. Definitely go with On The Beat, you will not regret it!!

We cannot recommend On The Beat highly enough! We hired Cardinal Gold (11-piece band) and they absolutely stole the show at our wedding reception. Their infectious energy kept our ...

party going all night long, and our guests were uniformly blown away by their talent and energy. The set list was perfectly curated, catering to all ages and tastes, and the dance floor was packed from start to finish. For late night, OTB helped us transition to a DJ. The transition was SO seamless and the DJ kept the momentum going, and we were thrilled to see our guests dancing until the very last song. What truly sets On The Beat apart, however, is the exceptional service and warmth provided by Robert and Megan. From our initial meeting, we knew we were in good hands. Their professionalism, enthusiasm, and kindness made the entire planning process a breeze. If you're looking for a wedding band that will deliver an unforgettable experience, look no further than On The Beat. We feel incredibly lucky to have had them as part of our special day. Five stars aren't enough - we'd give them ten if we could!

to work with and communicative and OTBMA and Rob were. We had heard his band, The Mixtape play at our relatives' wedding and were so blown away we had to have them for ours. At the time, we and the other guests kept saying it was the best wedding band we had ever heard. Somehow, for our wedding, they took it to another level! They absolutely crushed it! The dance floor was never less than 75% full at all times! Even three months later we still have people coming up to us saying how amazing the wedding was and asking where we found that awesome band! Additionally, Rob did an impeccable job emceeing the night. He had the perfect tone and was able to flow from one item to the next perfectly. In summation, if you are looking for an awesome band to dance the night away to. Stop looking, you've found them already. Do yourself a favor and hire OTBMA immediately!

We told them to dress however they'd like and that was the right choice. They looked awesome. All of our guests told us how awesome they were. The MC was great as well.

Where do we even begin?? We found On The Beat through online recommendations. We were initially very impressed with their website and the very high reviews we read from previous cl...

ients. Coming from a musical background and family, the one aspect of our wedding we needed to NAIL was the entertainment. We also had guests coming from all around the world to visit Southern California for the very first time, so we wanted to make their travel worth every penny. Our goal was to keep as many elderly friends and family (who would have otherwise gone home after dinner) on the dance floor until the band closed out the venue. During the search, we went back and forth with different bands and DJs for over three months, but for some reason in the back of our minds we just had a feeling that On The Beat would guarantee us the true quality we were looking for with the price we were willing to pay. A few weeks later after our initial virtual interview with Robert and Megan, we decided to make the decision to hire On The Beat. Suffice it to say, they met and absolutely exceeded expectations in all areas. The band was praised all night and talked about even 3 months later! Robert and Megan made the planning process so easy for us. They laid out the contract for us early on to help us manage expectations for the big day. They also were SO flexible with our wishes. We had hoped to have a close family member play keyboard for the bridal processional. Robert and Megan made that happen without us having to worry about anything. The keyboard and sound was prepared and ready to go with an ample amount of time for my brother in-law to sound check and practice prior to the ceremony. They constantly made themselves available to us to answer any questions that we had throughout the planning process using their seamless client “one stop shop” website. They were also able to accommodate an additional trumpet player within a month of the wedding. One of the aspects that also made On The Beat stand out from its competitors was that they gave us a blank Spotify playlist to let us fill in whatever songs we liked. At the wedding, they performed at least 90% of the songs that we had requested. It was an absolute blast. To those of you reading this review, look no further for your entertainment needs. Robert and Megan will take great care of you. If you want your wedding to be the greatest party you have ever hosted, HIRE THIS COMPANY! We are trying to find every excuse to hire On the Beat again, so its highly possible that we might hire them again for our future child’s 1 year old birthday party! HAHA Robert and Megan, thank you for making our wedding a day we will never forget for the rest of our lives. We appreciate the hard work that your team put on and we will never forget you all!

Rob and his team were absolutely phenomenal! We had The Mixtape band play at our wedding in Temecula, CA and they could not have been any better! Raw talent runs through that group...

, from the singers, to the instrumentalists, to the sound people/crew. I'm not lying when I say that literally ALL of our guests told us "that was the best wedding band we've ever seen!" The three vocalists were jaw-droppingly talented. All of the instrumentalists were incredibly talented as well AND they could sing! I'm pretty sure everyone in the band had at least one solo on the mic. The guitarist also played acoustic guitar during our ceremony and he was top-notch. He easily created his own cover to our song request for the bride's entrance and it was beautiful. They handled all sound and lighting for the entire day, and it all went off without a hitch. Rob himself managed and MC'd the evening and was professional through and through. Overall, On The Beat and The Mixtape band exceeded expectations. They read the crowd's vibe all night and adjusted perfectly to what we responded to. They interacted with the guests so well and with much frequency that it felt like they were part of the family. If you end up booking On The Beat for you wedding, you will not regret it (and also invite us to your wedding so we can experience it again HA!)

We hired OTB Music Agency this past weekend for our wedding. Our band was named Sir Duke and I honestly could write for days about how incredible this band truly is! I knew since...

I was a little girl that I would want live music at my wedding one day and boy did I get it! I made sure to reserve a good chunk of my wedding fund just for the band itself because it was high on my list! My only regret is that, they didn’t get to play for as long as I’d hoped but that was all a timeline issue on our end and had nothing to do with them. When they did start, they were even more amazing than their videos on IG or YouTube. I should have got their names, but the lead singers were absolute perfection, they could all belt like you wouldn’t believe! They played all the hits you want to hear at weddings and even offered to sing my father of the bride dance song live for me and my dad which absolutely made his night! I was on the dancefloor for almost their entire set because I didn’t ant to miss it! It was also like 100 degrees where we got married and they were completely professional and just sang/danced through it like it didn’t affect them In the slightest. A couple of things I might change were minor but my husband and I nonetheless noticed them as a few of our guests did as well. After we said I do and kissed, they accidentally started playing one of our processional songs for a couple of seconds instead of our “just married” recessional song. No big deal but it did throw us off a tad. Another thing was more of an issue for me and to be honest it could have been on my wedding panner but I feel like better communication could have been had between her and the band once the MC was to announce our grand entrance. The MC announced us almost 30 seconds before we reached the grand entrance starting point so our guests were a bit thrown off and confused as to where we were lol as were my new husband and I. We were walking as fast as we could to get there so the guests wouldn’t be looking around for too long, so it was a bit of a letdown of a grand entrance that I was really looking forward too. All-in-all, I would hire them in a heartbeat again because the entertainment was absolutely incredible and they were worth it! Thank you OTB or making our reception a party to remember, hope to be able to hire again in the future!

lowed down and altered to work) and sent it ahead of time so that we could choreograph a dance to it. \- They learned several songs at our request and performed one in an encore performance that brought the house down \- They were so good that our friends, getting married next year, cancelled their band to hire "On The Beat" instead.

I don’t even know where to begin with this review to show my appreciation. My husband and I booked The Mixtape from On the Beats to perform at our wedding in July and magical is an...

understatement to how the night turned out. Considering that we did not hire a wedding coordinator prior to the wedding, and our venue was non-inclusive of anything, you can imagine how determined I was to get every detail right for our special day. That meant that there were an endless amount of questions and revisions along the way but the owner, Robert Perkins, patiently attended to all of my concerns and walked through this journey with us wholeheartedly. Up until the wedding, I was extremely on edge about the outcome of the overall ambiance. However, once the day came, the musicians spoke for themselves. From the intimate string trio for the ceremony/cocktail hour to the 6-piece band we hired for the reception/dance, it was all so seamlessly put together, creating the perfect ambiance. We specifically requested Fina and Hudson to lead the band, and the power in their voice was able to both shake and silence the entire room with one note. We requested that they perform lounge music, some Leon Bridges, and jazz during dinner while we selected a few dance songs for the end of the night. All of our guests watched in awe as they performed every single song that we requested and they effortlessly flowed with the energy of the crowd. It felt as though we were watching a celebrity band perform and even the Korean elderly parents/grandparents were jamming and dancing along to the music. Everyone was completely mesmerized and enveloped in their talented voices and classy performance and I truly believe that our night would not have been as perfect as it was had we not hired On the Beats. The owner, Rob, stuck by the entire night and was the emcee for us and although there was a slight language barrier with my Korean guests, he was so personable to everyone and put a smile on all of our faces. He even substituted as a drummer for the duration of one song, which meant a lot considering he was once the drummer for Michael Buble!! If you’re ever on the fence about hiring a band, trust me and hire one. I, as well as all of our guests, have been to our many fair shares of weddings but everyone said that nothing compared to their experience with ours. The band created an environment where there is authentic energy and transparent love. Thank you, endlessly, to all of the members from On the Beats (The Mixtape) for making that day literally the best day of our lives. Stay tuned for some photos and videos!

We had tons of communication before the wedding to help prep - picking songs, run of show, venue walk through, etc. Rob was very straight forward, easy to talk to, and so incredibly kind. The band themselves were so amazing. The level of professionalism was unparalleled and they really just brought the energy all night. Each and every one of them were so kind and we were so appreciative that they just brought it for our wedding.

They were no issues at the wedding, and we couldn’t be happier with them, both as the emcees and band. Rob worked with us leading up to our wedding to make sure that everything was in line with our expectations. We had multiple calls to go over all the details and it all ended up perfectly. He accommodated all of our requests for special songs and made sure we had what we needed. Rob communicated constantly with us. He informed us of a change that needed to be made because of availability but worked with us to find a better replacement at no additional cost. We couldn’t recommend them more. If they are available for your wedding book them. Simple as that.

Not only did they perfectly incorporate our “must have” song list, they aced every other artist in their arsenal. THE PRICE: there were band quotes we got back for double the price of On The Beat.

There are not enough accolades I can say about On the Beat. Their music is incredible — they have YouTube videos/samples that you can hear for yourself, and all I can say is that ...

if you like what you hear, it’s even better in person. But you’re getting more than just a polished band — you’re getting a professional operation. They don’t just play a list of songs that you provide them (which we did before our wedding) — they were gauging the mood on the dance floor, and they adjusted the music (in particular, the tempo) to fit the moment. And while we had only expected them to play music after dinner service, a couple band members performed beautiful solos during dinner (the keyboardist, in particular, absolutely crushed a rendition of U2’s “All I Want is You” — we stopped eating our food so we could soak in the moment). As a bonus, Rob and his team also made sure that all of our sound needs for the wedding ceremony were taken care of, including mics, amplifiers, etc. On the Beat is worth hiring for their music alone, but when you consider their attention to detail and genuine desire to do everything possible to make your wedding special, you simply can’t go wrong. Everyone wants their wedding to be perfect, and if that’s the case, On the Beat is for you.

I'm going to be honest... as the bride, I am a bit jealous that our guests have (and continued to) compliment how fantastic Sir Duke/On The Beat was MORE than they've complimented ...

how I looked on my wedding day :) I am not exaggerating when I write that our guests cannot stop talking about how the band was a game changer and really brought energy and liveliness to our wedding party. We had been to several friends weddings with live bands and knew that just about any band or DJ would not suffice for our crowd as we needed entertainers that would be able to cater to a wide range of friends and family. OTB/Sir Duke was exactly what we were searching for and more! They performed feel good, dance music that our generation and our grand/parents' generation danced to all night- seamlessly mixing covers of Bruno Mars, Prince, Frank Sinatra, Beyonce, and Mariah Carey- who does that?! We could not have chosen a better band for one of the most important days of our lives. I was a very thorough bride, making spreadsheets upon spreadsheets comparing vendors from florists to entertainment, and when I first spoke on the phone with Rob, the band manager, I knew he would be able to deliver our exact wedding vision- AND he did! Most importantly, Rob worked with us to make sure we stayed within our budget. Not only were we able to book the band to perform during our wedding reception, but OTB also supplied the sound system for our ceremony, managed the recessional and processional music coordination with our planner, helped us book the band guitarist to play songs during cocktail hour after the ceremony, AND MC'd the entire night. Rob even met with us in person 2-3 weeks before our big day to review the day of timeline, special dance songs, required song lists, and give us a sneak peek of the set list he already had in mind. In addition to the 6 piece band (including 1 male and 1 female lead vocalists), Rob and a sound engineer were also on site the day of our wedding to make sure the performance was perfect. Unbeknownst to me, he even worked with my husband to coordinate a surprise performance with his groomsmen and the band. I cannot recommend OTB music agency enough for your special day.

It’s not easy when choosing the band to perform on the most important day of your life. We knew we wanted great voices, musicians, and song variety, but we were honestly blown away...

by this group. They surpassed all of our expectations with their incredible voices (even better live than the videos) and musical talent. They don’t just play, they pllaaaay and they can’t just sing, they can saaanng! The best part of all of it was how helpful and specific they were to us and making our day special. Our first meeting was with Rob the director and we knew right away that this was the right group. Rob is a kind and thoughtful leader and he put us at ease when he told us the level of responsibility he takes for making everything perfect. He even helped me create a special moment for my bride when he facilitated a special performance where I got to sing with the band. I sang Fly me to the Moon and the band helped me nail it. All in all, this group helped make our night perfect. We danced, we sang, we celebrated. Since then we’ve heard from every guest at our wedding that the band was phenomenal. So if you too want to create a perfect night with memories that will last a lifetime, you’ve come to the right group.

pply/provide. On June 30th 2019, at a sweet Malibu venue, our vision came to life and to say the night was perfect would be bold - but perhaps not overstated. It's hard to capture in words (even for a humble verbal painter), the ambiance, the energy, the pure joy that the Sir Duke band emanated from the stage. It's on those rare occasions when we our decision exceeds expectations that life seems to vibrate in harmony and sound and color are never quite as vibrant as in those moments. As I looked out from the bobbing sea of crisp tuxedos and fresh evening gowns, moving in time with the sounds of Sir Duke I knew this one of those occasions. To say the band exceeded expectations is a vast understatement and perhaps the only way to comprehend their virtuosity is simply to make that decision and book them. Quite simply put, Sir Duke exceeds expectations.
