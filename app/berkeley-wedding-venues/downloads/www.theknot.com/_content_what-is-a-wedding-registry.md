Whether you just received an invite to a wedding or you started planning your own, you might wonder, what is a wedding registry and how does it work? Basically, it's a wish list that helps couples share what they'd love as they start their new life together, while making gift-giving easier for guests. Couples receive gifts that they actually want, whether it's a much-needed coffee maker or a cash fund to put toward their new home, while guests don't have to play the guessing game when it comes to picking out a present.

It's not uncommon to see couples with multiple registries that cater to different needs, which is why [The Knot Registry Store](https://www.theknot.com/registry/store/categories/tabletop/flatware) connects any registry to keep them all in one place—convenient for both guests _and_ couples! It's also easy to navigate, with the ability to search by price, material and other filters.

Like many parts of the wedding planning process, the wedding registry is a tradition steeped in history that has also evolved over time. Here's everything you need to know about the wedding registry's meaning and how to use one.

**In this article:**What Is a Wedding Registry? | Wedding Registry History | What Is the Purpose of a Wedding Registry?




## What Is a Wedding Registry?

So, just how do you define a registry for a wedding? What does a wedding registry _actually_ mean? In a nutshell, it's a way for engaged couples to share their wish list of items they want or need with their wedding guests, according to Sarah Blessinger, owner, wedding planner and designer of [Kindred Weddings and Events](https://kindredweddingsandevents.com/) in Los Angeles. It's ultimately a helpful guide for guests that removes the stress from picking out a present throughout the couple's entire wedding journey.

Wedding registries are typically hosted online and can feature physical products, such as dishware, linens and household items, or experience gifts, like honeymoon excursions. (We have a full guide on [how a wedding registry works](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-registry-26-top-tips) for specifics on putting one together.) But the wedding registry definition has changed slightly with modern times. If a couple has everything they want, they may skip the personal gift-giving for something else. 

"Sometimes a couple may opt to forgo a traditional wedding registry," Blessinger says. "In this case, they may ask guests to donate to a charity that is important to them in lieu of buying the couple a wedding present."

## Wedding Registry History

The history of wedding registries dates way back to the ancient Greeks. But it became popular in America in the early 1920s when a Marshall Field's department store, now known as Macy's, in Chicago, launched the first wedding registry. "It was a way for engaged couples to easily share with their guests the items they most desired from the store, like glassware and fine china," explains Blessinger. "Soon, more stores caught on to the idea, and over time, wedding registries became more tech-integrated to allow for seamless shopping experiences."

As department and specialty stores followed suit, creating a wedding registry became a standard part of the wedding planning process for engaged couples. With the help of a registry specialist, they'd pick out their favorite homewares from their preferred store(s), walking around with a hand-held barcode scanner to register the china or crystal they were eyeing. The roster of stores was passed along to guests to shop from, and the store clerk would delete the purchased registry products to avoid duplicate presents.

Today, putting together a registry is much simpler because it's typically done online. Couples can add products with an instant click at multiple places and create a [universal wedding registry](https://www.theknot.com/content/the-knot-universal-registry). They can include a link to the wedding registry on their wedding website and the URL on their wedding invitations, making it easily accessible to guests. 

[Wedding registry ideas](https://www.theknot.com/content/best-wedding-registry-ideas) have also evolved, partly because many couples get married at a later age than those who married in the 1920s. That means they've likely already acquired some homewares, whereas couples a century ago were doing so for the first time. While homewares are still considered wedding registry essentials, they may fall under the category of "wants" or upgrades rather than actual "needs." Gift cards for experiences and cash funds for honeymoons or buying a home have also become more common. Regardless, this [wedding registry checklist](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-registry-checklist-essentials) can help you determine what you want and don't want to include on your wedding registry.

## What Is the Purpose of a Wedding Registry?

What exactly is the point of a wedding registry? As Blessinger puts it, a wedding registry means that guests don't have to deal with the guesswork involved in choosing a gift for the newlyweds. After all, there may be a few times when you're preparing to buy a gift during a couple's engagement, from an engagement present to a bridal shower gift to the actual wedding present.

"Instead of guessing which household items or linen patterns the couple might like, a wedding registry acts as a wish list of what the couple still needs as they build their home together," Blessinger says. 

Wedding registries also help prevent couples from receiving items they don't want or the same item from someone else. "Once an item from a wedding registry is purchased, it is removed from the list and marked as 'purchased' so couples don't end up with duplicates of the same item," she adds.

So, [do you need a wedding registry](https://www.theknot.com/content/is-it-okay-to-buy-non-registry-gift)? That's up to you. While wedding registries can be helpful for both the couple and the guests, if you truly don't feel the need for one, there are always other options.
