I discovered Blush Bridal and Prom on a Facebook event, where they were promoting a Trunk sale of wedding gowns that were about to come out the following year. I had gone to one of...

the most popular bridal salons in Sacramento with my closest friends and family, tried on a few dresses, and just had the worst experience. I decided to go to this event in Concord alone, not really knowing what to expect, or really expecting to find a dress. I got to Blush Bridal and was instantly impressed as soon as I was greeted. Cheryl,the owner, was extremely helpful and made my time there a memorable one. Since I was there alone, the staff there helped me try on dresses and gave me all of their attention when necessary. I ended up buying my picture perfect dress there that day, without any of my friends or family. I even stayed a little bit after, chatted with them a bit, and enjoyed a glass of champagne! Even if I didn't find my dress there, I would recommend BBP just for their incredibly warm and helpful staff.

Blush Bridal made my experience of wedding dress shopping more amazing than I ever thought it would be. I found this salon by chance and it was the best decision I could have made....

Cheryl and Sherry were so warm and welcoming into the salon and made sure that I was getting all the attention I needed, but still hanging back for me to have special moments with the MOH and bridesmaids. They have an amazing collection of dresses and are always getting new items in. I am fortunate to have found my dream dress on my very first visit, despite getting something completely different than I thought I would. I was nervous about being a curvy bride that I wouldn't fit into the samples but I am happy to say I even needed clips! Lots of larger sample sizes! I am also self conscious and was anxious about having someone in the dressing room with me while I was changing, but they would only go in there when I wanted them to be in there. I felt so comfortable the entire time. If you are looking for a dress and have these same fears, go to Blush Bridal! You will not regret it!

oment. The store is beautiful and the dress selection has something for everyone. Cheryl's selection of bridesmaid and prom dresses is great and you can tell quality is very important to her. I highly encourage every curvy bride to make an appointment at Blush Bridal and Prom. Cheryl and team are exactly the kind of people you want helping you to find the dress for one of the most important days of your life.

remember! I was able to try on many dresses in a variety of lighting. I would highly recommend this place to anyone trying to find the perfect dress. They have more than just wedding dresses as well! My mom was able to find an absolutely stunning dress for my wedding as well. They also can fit, style, bridesmaid dresses as well if you wish to do so.

As a curvy bride, I was really anxious about dress shopping. So I was so excited to go to Blush Bridal and they did not disappoint. Cheryl was the greatest! We had the whole place ...

to ourselves during my appointment, and she did everything to make us feel VIP. I was so impressed that she had thoroughly read my questionnaire responses prior to my appointment, and even looked up my venue to really understand the feel of my wedding. I ended up purchasing the first dress I tried on here. It truly was everything 'Say Yes to the Dress' made me think dress shopping should be. My mom and I both cannot wait to come back for my fitting! Update: I cannot thank Cheryl enough for getting me the perfect dress. Like I said in my previous review, shopping at Blush Bridal was great and easy. Between ordering my dress and my wedding date, I lost 30 pounds, so needless to say I needed a lot of alterations. I do think we may have started a little late; I ended up needing two rounds of alterations which left me picking up my dress the same week as my wedding. But in the end it fit perfectly! My mom bought her dress for my wedding here as well. They had a beautiful blue-gray high-low skirt dress she fell in love with, but was probably 2-3 sizes too small with not enough time to order a new one. Their seamstress turned the zipper into a lace-up back to give the extra room. It turned out gorgeous! We were both so thrilled.

bably 2.5hrs and at no point did we feel pressured to make a decision. During the appointment we had full reign of the store and definitely had the most memorable experience. I cannot recommend this salon enough. My biggest concern was not being able to fit into wedding dresses of the rack because of their smaller sizing but at Blush they had dresses in all different sizes. If you are looking for an inclusive salon with a small business vibe and a store owner who is willing to have fun with you this is the place to go, I cannot recommend it enough!

is so beautiful! My sister and I only spent about an hour and a half trying on dresses and I was able to narrow down my selection to three dresses, especially because of Cheryl and Sherry's help. The dress I said yes to was not a style I would normally gravitate to but Cheryl suggested I try it on because it looked like it would be a great match with my theme and venue. I'm so happy I tried it on and I cant wait to wear my dress on my day. Thank you from the bottom of my heart, Cheryl and Sherry!!!
