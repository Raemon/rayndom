Niall Stevenson

Owner

I was born & raised in Ireland but have lived in San Francisco since '99. I grew up in a musical family, we all played instruments, I played the piano so, music has always been a passion of mine. Starting a DJ/Entertainment business in 2009 was a very natural transition for me, as being Irish we are naturally very social people with lots of passion for making people happy & have a great time. I believe I have built a business that provides a personal hands on service while maintaining a professional feel. Our events are classy fun, non cheesy and personally tailored to each individual client

We hired Four Leaf for our wedding DJ in early November. They were recommended by our venue as the best and most fun DJs! From the start, Niall was super communicative and easy to ...

work with. The price was very reasonable and we added on reception lighting for not too much more of a cost. Before the event, Niall sent over a form to get all of our song preferences for different phases of the evening. Though he ended up being sick the day of, he sent Chris who did an awesome job and was super friendly and nice. We were particularly impressed with how spot on the happy hour and dinner music was with our musical preferences. During the dance party, Chris balanced all the guest requests with our choices and other popular hits. I would definitely recommend Four Leaf for your wedding!

My wedding at the Cliff House was in November, and I am still in awe of every little thing that went so perfectly but ESPECIALLY the music! The music and dancing were actually the ...

things I was most excited for, and Niall did not disappoint - he nailed it!! From the ceremony music which he tailored an re-recorded to be perfect for our vision, to even the dinner music which was beyond well-matched for the vibe and crowd, and to the all-night dancing extravaganza, during which he played every must-play song (and at just the right times might I add!) and gauged the crowd just right - Niall made out day perfect. His MC abilities are off the charts (plus his Irish accent does not hurt!), and he adds so much to the vibe without overstepping in any way. Not to mention, his equipment was great! The up lights added a TON! And his microphones and speakers systems were really top notch. That might sound like a funny thing to add, but our videographer used the audio from Niall's speakers in our video and it was SO crisp. One other huge thing is that his pre-wedding survey was SO detailed, and made me answer questions I wouldn't have even thought of, that it really led to every detail for our day, down to the song playing during cake cutting, being perfect! He just goes above and beyond, which is so wonderful when you're planning something as stressful as a wedding. Would I recommend Niall as your wedding (or other festivity!) DJ? Absolutely! He did a beyond amazing job, and I would recommend him to anyone who would listen!

arly on and I was a pretty annoying bride emailing (probably more than I should have...) quite often. He was always quick to get back to me and provided me all the information I needed. He gave us the form pretty early on so we had plenty of time to gather our music. I called Niall the night before asking him to edit the parent dances shorter and he said no problem! He comforted us in saying that many couples do it so we didn't have to feel bad. I felt bad since it was the night before our event but he didn't seem bothered. We gave him genres for our cocktail hour, dinner and throughout the night and the freedom to play to the crowd. We've gotten sooo many compliments on the music so thank you, Niall! I have to comment that he looked very dapper! I was pretty lenient with dress code because I didn't want anyone uncomfortable but I was very pleased to see him dressed nicely! He arrived with plenty of time to set up and be out of the way - the reception hall was up the driveway behind the ceremony so all vendors had to be there and ready a half hour before the ceremony to have the cars out of the way. I was a nervous wreck about this but come the day of, I had no issues. Like I said, I am trying to find a reason to book with Niall again because he was incredible. There was not a single thing I would change about my experience with FLE!

Niall, the owner of Four Lead Entertainment, was awesome at our daughter’s (and, now son-in-law’s), wedding. He is charming, professional and gets the crowd dancing from start to ...

finish. He followed the time-line to perfection and had the crowd dancing the whole night. He is excellent at reading the crowd and selecting music that makes people not want to leave the dance floor. We played a video of the ceremony (which was private the day before) at the reception and Niall took care of all the details involved in getting the screen and projector, setting it up, taking it down, and making the entire process go so smoothly. That was something that I had worried about for months. He assured me that it would all be handled and not to worry. It was perfect!! Niall also took care of the uplighting in the room which was also important to me. Our timeline was a little out of the ordinary. We showed the wedding video to start, introduced the bride and groom, did their first dance and then invited everyone to join them on the dance floor to get the party started before salad was even served. Niall was right on it and the party was started! Everyone loved it! If you are looking for a fabulous DJ and MC for your wedding or party, hire Niall. That Irish accent is the icing on the cake. You will love him!

Martin Hodge of Four Leaf Entertainment is outstanding! We would recommend him for any event. In our initial meeting with Martin, we felt very fortunate that he was DJing/MCing our...

wedding. He went over our playlist and wedding schedule with such careful detail. We could just tell that it was important to him that everything ran perfectly. For the wedding party entrance, he pronounced all our names perfectly despite the fact that there were some difficult names to pronounce. Our bridal party coordinated a short choreographed dance (about 30 seconds), and Martin was on point to make sure only the correct 30 seconds of the song was played. Another instance that really attests to Martin’s precision and knowledge, is the fact that for our first bride/groom dance, we were really terrified to dance to the whole song, so Martin made an abridged version of the song and assured us that once we did our final dance move (a dip), he would fade the song out. Throughout the reception, Martin’s charisma and energy kept everything flowing smoothly and on time. There was never a moment where our guests felt restless or bored. His selection of music appealed to all ages, and we will always reminisce seeing our college friends dancing side by side with our great aunts and uncles. The dance floor was packed even till the end of the night – we were worried that we would get charged for overtime because our guests did not want the dancing to stop. Martin Hodge, thank you for your amazing work!
