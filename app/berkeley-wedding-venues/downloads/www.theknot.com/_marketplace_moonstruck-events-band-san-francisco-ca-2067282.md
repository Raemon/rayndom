The Moonstruck band absolutely rocked at our wedding! Their eclectic mix of classic wedding anthems and contemporary hits was what first caught our eye when browsing different wedd...

ing bands, and we loved that the setlist was fun for all of our guests, young and old. Our dance floor was packed the entire night! They also made great choices when we left the musical decision up to them, such as for the pre-ceremony, cocktail hour, and dinner music. They were lovely to work with and extremely accommodating to all of our needs and requests!

Moonstruck is definitely of the best! Emma and her band went above and beyond for our wedding. Their 6 piece band was amazing and each of them is clearly dedicated! You could feel ...

their passion throughout the night... and they were SUPER DUPER AMAZING! All of our guests raved about them!! You won't be disappointed!! One memory I'll always have comes from as we were planning out the wedding and all its details. My wedding planner was mapping out a true break for them, and Emma said that we actually prefer to play straight through - 'that way we don't lose the momentum and we love to keep playing for hours straight.' Wow. They did and definitely kept the night going cuz of that. We are so grateful we hired Moonstruck... we were definitely struck :) and now only have wonderful memories we'll cherish forever.

Don't think twice -- book Moonstruck for your event; you will be thrilled you did (as we are)! We chose them for our wedding, both as the reception band (7-person) and as a jazz tr...

io during cocktails. They are incredibly talented, play a range of great music, and are wonderful to work with. Emma's voice is out of this world. My husband is picky when it comes to music (his sister is a professional), and they exceeded his hopes. Two months later, our guests still rave about how much fun they were.

ng fun all night long and thanks to Moonstruck, everyone had the BEST time. People are STILL reaching out months later raving about the band. In addition to our event night, communicating and planning with them was SO easy. They made a stressful time simpler and easier when we were in the thick of planning and chaos. They were the best choice for us! Thank you Moonstruck!!!

t of the night for both me and my now (:D) husband and we really wanted to make sure it was the highlight of the night. And let me tell you, Moonstruck did not disappoint! Their song choices were amazing, they had all the guests up and dancing, and created the exact atmosphere we were hoping for. They were so easy to communicate with regarding scheduling and were super obliging to our song requests. Our friends and family are still telling us how good the music was. From the first song to the last, Moonstruck made our night so special, so fun, and so filled with love!

us performers - bringing infectious energy along with the stellar music. There happened to be several people staying in a house close to the venue - while on the dance floor, I realized they'd all come outside and were dancing too. Moonstruck is that good - they got not just the wedding guests, but everyone within earshot, on their feet! If I wasn’t already married, I’d be hiring Moonstruck to play my wedding.

What a great group!! The minute our event was done we were saying we want to hire them again. We started with the jazz trio and ended the night with the great dancing music. Emma ...

has a beautiful voice and all the performers are very talented. I chatted with Paul and Emma on the phone, both were accommodating, easy to work with and professional. If I were you I would see if they have your date open as you will want to hire them!! Many partygoers asked for their information at our event. Personal thank you to them for making it a memorable evening.

I booked Moonstruck for a city concert and THEY WERE FANTASTIC! Not only did they sound great, but they were extremely friendly and easy to work with.

Having Moonstruck perform at our wedding was one of the best decisions we made - so fun! Working with them was easy and professional. They are so talented and know a wide selection...

of songs, and they were willing to even learn a few special songs. Highly recommend.

reated SO much joy and fun for us and our guests. Emma Roos, one of the two singers was spectacular and went above and beyond not only in her performance, but in how she orchestrated our evening. The musicians were all incredibly talented. WOW! Our friends thought our wedding was one of the best they had been to, and the band was the heart of our celebration

I have previously worked in the industry, so when we were looking for a band to play our wedding, I had a high bar in terms of my expectations and how I envisaged my night to unf...

old, and so when looking for potential acts, I initially struggled to find a good fit. That is, until I found Moonstruck! I was confident that I had found "my entertainment" from the response to my first enquiry, and boy, was I right. The communication was flawless throughout the entire process, which helped us all to understand and envisage what we were looking for and what was possible. They were super responsive to any queries and requests that we had and more than willing to offer guidance. This all resulted in such a smooth and unforgettable evening for us and all our guests on the day. They had us all (from young to old) up dancing from the start, and held them there until the very end. It was joyous and Moonstruck were perfect for our needs. It was good to know that we'd hit a home-run with this very important aspect of our special day. I have been in and around the live music scene for most of my career and I also have to say that I was very impressed with the precision and overall level of musical live performance that Moonstruck provided, which of course was also as important to us as the level of communication and conversation leading up to our big day. All of which resulted in The Perfect Night. They made us feel comfortable from the get-go, and then they went on to deliver on that initial professionalism, and more. I wouldn't hesitate to use them again or recommend them - which is exactly what I'm doing here! If you're looking for an all-round stellar service for your wedding or event, a high-level interaction in the lead-up and a polished band and ultimately, an uplifting end to your wedding day or event, you should definitely give Moonstruck a try. What do you have to lose in making contact? They might be just the band you need, and you might find, like I did, that finding that perfect fit early in the process makes organising the rest of your day or evening SO much less stressful.

I’m a huge fan of Moonstruck. I’ve gone out of my way to hear them perform multiple times at Maggie McGarry’s and they don’t disappoint. They are talented musicians, and their re...

ndition of classic songs is really well done. The vocalists are charismatic and engaging, and they get the audience on their feet. I’ve watched them draw people in off the street and fill the bar up in minutes. I would highly recommend them for a corporate event or a wedding.

Hiring a wedding band was one of the most important aspects for me and my husbands wedding. We wanted a band that not only knew the music we wanted to play, but had the ability to ...

read the room and provide the right commentary and music at the right time. I did not hire a wedding coordinator so a lot of my wedding was DIY, I needed vendors I could trust to do what they needed to do without me worrying about them. Moonstruck did that and more! They were extremely professional and so friendly. They were able to not only play beautifully but engaged with my friends and family to get them hyped or to listen to announcements. They even got my husbands 83 year old grandma up and dancing! They provided such a fun and memorable night for us, I couldn't have asked for a better band. Thank you Moonstruck!
