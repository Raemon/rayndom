Working with Lauren and Jillian was honestly one of the best choices we made for our wedding. We spent about a year and a half planning, and our venue had so many moving parts with...

multiple ceremony and reception areas, shuttles, vendor load-ins, and countless small details that had to line up perfectly. We also went through several vendor changes, including switching our florist and caterer just a few months out, and they handled every single update with so much grace and ease. Every time something changed, Lauren and Jillian were already one step ahead. They updated timelines, reached out to new vendors, and kept everything so organized that I never felt stressed or behind. They were always quick to respond to emails when I would suddenly think of a question or new idea. I could tell they truly cared about every part of the process and wanted it to be perfect for us. On the wedding day everything ran flawlessly. The ceremony started right on time, the transitions between spaces felt seamless, and I never once saw or heard about any issues. I know things must have come up behind the scenes, but they handled everything so smoothly that we never noticed. They both had the warmest smiles all day and kept such a calm and happy energy around us. One of my favorite moments was when Jillian quietly fixed a floral install that had slipped right before guests arrived. She didn’t say a word, she just handled it and made it perfect. Lauren checked in with me throughout the day to make sure I was hydrated and actually eating, which meant so much because it showed how much they truly cared. They made what could have been an overwhelming and complicated day feel completely effortless. I cannot imagine doing it without them. If you want planners who are kind, steady, and genuinely invested in your day, Lauren and Jillian are everything you could hope for.

There is A LOT that goes into wedding planning. Way more than I ever could have imagined. I knew we would need help planning but I had no clue how much a planner would change our e...

ntire experience for the better! Lauren is calm, organized, and so easy to talk to. We hosted the wedding at our family’s property in Napa, so there were a lot of moving parts, including rentals, lighting, parking, and catering, and she handled every bit of it with total ease. She came to the estate multiple times before the wedding to walk the space and think through things I never would have even considered. She figured out where the power sources should go for the band, how to position the tables for the best sunset view, and even where to put the bar so guests wouldn’t block the dinner flow. On the day of the wedding she and her team were everywhere but somehow invisible, fixing little things before anyone noticed. When the wind picked up during dinner, Lauren quietly had the candles relit and the napkins tucked without anyone missing a beat. During the ceremony she helped the flower girls feel calmer right before they walked down the aisle. She was so great with all of the children and made them feel so comfortable. She helped bustle my daughter’s dress right before their first dance when no one else could figure it out. I didn’t worry about a single thing the entire day, which as a mom is saying a lot. I just got to be present and watch my daughter have the time of her life surrounded by all the people we love. If you’re planning a wedding in Napa or anywhere in wine country, Lauren is truly the best. She’s professional, genuine, and made our whole weekend feel beautiful and most importantly stress free. I refer her to everyone I know!

I will be the first to admit that I was a bit of a crazy bride. I changed my mind a hundred times, had a Pinterest board for every detail, and probably sent Lauren and Jillian more...

emails than they ever wanted to read. They handled everything with so much patience, humor, and precision that I could actually enjoy the process. This was a large wedding and a big production with many moving pieces. There were so many opportunities for things to go wrong, but everything came together perfectly. When I switched florists two months before the wedding, Lauren helped me rework the entire design plan and even met with the new florist to make sure everything matched my vision. When the band’s lead singer got sick the day before, Jillian had a backup ready to go without missing a beat. On the wedding day, I decided I wanted to move our first look location at the last minute and they just smiled, made a few quick calls, and somehow had it ready with the photographer waiting. There were so many little moments where they went above and beyond. When one of the rental trucks got stuck in traffic, they reorganized the setup schedule so everything still looked perfect when guests arrived. When the flower girl spilled juice down her dress before photos, Jillian appeared out of nowhere with a stain remover pen and napkins. They even helped my dad with his boutonniere, fixed the groomsmen’s pocket squares, and managed to keep our energetic bridal party exactly where they needed to be for photos. I am sure things went wrong behind the scenes, but to this day I have no idea what they were. They fixed my dress before every photo, kept the timeline on track, and made sure our families were taken care of without ever making it feel rushed. Even my mom commented that she had never seen an event run so beautifully without any visible stress or confusion. Lauren and Jillian are the dream team. They made me feel supported, heard, and genuinely cared for. The day was beautiful, emotional, and full of laughter. I will never forget how much effort and heart they put into making it all happen exactly the way I wanted.

From our very first planning call with Lauren, I knew we were working with someone who genuinely understood what we wanted. My main goal for the wedding was to keep things private,...

intimate, and most importantly, to keep my bride calm and stress free. Lauren made that happen from start to finish. She anticipated every little thing before it became an issue. When one of our vendors was running behind, she handled it so smoothly that my wife never even knew there had been a delay. The florals arrived missing a few key pieces, and somehow by the time we were taking photos, everything looked absolutely perfect. I still do not know how she pulled that off. She also made sure our guest experience matched what we envisioned. We wanted it to feel personal and exclusive, like a family gathering rather than a big production. She coordinated the timing so that our first look and ceremony happened in total privacy. She even made sure guests were greeted with drinks and music while we had a quiet moment to ourselves before walking down the aisle. The entire day ran effortlessly, and I know that is because Lauren was behind the scenes making sure every detail fell into place. My wife still talks about how calm and happy she felt the entire day, and that is exactly how I wanted it. I cannot thank Lauren and her team enough for making our wedding feel like us, relaxed, beautiful, and absolutely seamless.

Lauren and Jillian were the dream team I didn’t know I needed. From the very beginning they made the planning process feel fun and completely manageable. They balance each other so...

well. Lauren is incredibly organized and calm under pressure, and Jillian brings this amazing creative energy and eye for design that ties everything together perfectly. They helped us plan every detail from our wine country rehearsal dinner to the sparkler exit at the end of the night. During the planning process they sent detailed checklists, design boards, and reminders that kept us on track. When I couldn’t decide between two floral styles they created a mock table so I could see everything in person and make the right choice. On the week of the wedding they confirmed with every vendor, handled the rental order, and even picked up extra candles when we ran short. The day itself was flawless. Lauren had every moment perfectly timed so I never once had to look at the clock. Jillian made sure the décor looked exactly how I had imagined it. They even made sure I had a bite to eat and a glass of champagne in hand before walking into the reception. Our families and vendors kept saying how seamless everything felt. The photos are stunning and we keep hearing from guests that it was one of the most beautiful and stress free weddings they have ever been to. I can’t thank Lauren and Jillian enough for their warmth, professionalism, and genuine care. They made the entire experience unforgettable and I would hire them again in a heartbeat for any future event

ss stressed about planning. I’m the type of bride who loves details — I changed the color palette three times, swapped out linen samples, and reworked the timeline more times than I can count. Lauren never once made me feel difficult. She just smiled, sent new mockups, and kept everything organized and on track. She even caught small things I would’ve missed — like making sure our escort cards matched the exact champagne tone of our napkins and that the candles were staggered perfectly down each table. On the wedding weekend, she was everywhere at once. She fluffed my dress before I walked down the aisle, made sure my mom had a glass of champagne in hand, and somehow got our florist to add extra greenery to the arbor right before the ceremony without me even knowing there was an issue. Every vendor she recommended was a dream, the photographer, rentals, and floral team all worked together seamlessly, which I know is a testament to how respected she is in the industry. The whole weekend felt effortless and magical. Guests are still talking about how beautiful and smooth everything was, and several have already reached out asking for her information. Lauren and her team are truly the reason our day was perfect. She made wedding planning actually fun, and I miss our planning calls more than I expected!

As the mother of the bride, I cannot say enough about Lauren and Jillian. They were an incredible team who truly went above and beyond to make my daughter’s wedding flawless. They ...

understood exactly what she wanted and made sure every detail reflected her style and personality. There were several moments that could have caused stress, but Lauren and Jillian handled them so gracefully that no one even noticed. When the shuttle driver took the wrong route and a group of guests was running late, they immediately rearranged the timeline and coordinated with the caterer so dinner service stayed perfectly on track. When one of the groomsmen misplaced his boutonniere, they quietly made a new one out of extra florals. During cocktail hour, a strong breeze started blowing through the courtyard, and they quickly adjusted the layout so candles stayed lit and décor remained beautiful for photos. They also went out of their way to take care of our family. They made sure my daughter had a private moment with her father before walking down the aisle, something that meant the world to us. They even packed up her personal items and gifts at the end of the night so we could simply enjoy the celebration without worrying about logistics. Every part of the day felt effortless because of their care, creativity, and professionalism. The wedding was stunning, emotional, and full of joy. I will always be grateful to Lauren and Jillian for creating a day our family will remember for the rest of our lives.
