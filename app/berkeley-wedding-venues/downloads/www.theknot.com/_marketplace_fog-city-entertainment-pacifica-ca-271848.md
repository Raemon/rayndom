Ashley was amazing! Leading up to the wedding, she was super helpful in guiding us through the steps to set up playlists and coordinate the intros/outros of the bridal party. Our w...

edding was spread out over a large property, and she had zero issue running speakers to each area, providing a festive, cozy atmosphere! We had a couple live performances and she was very accommodating in getting mic stands and cables all ready to go. Then the DANCING began! Lights, speakers, the whole deal - Ashley killed it! We leaned into more 70’s and 80’s music, and Ashley completely understood the assignment. Needless to say, the music mix was brilliant. Since then, we have had at least a dozen of our friends and family tell us that this was the most fun they have ever had at a wedding. I have no doubt that Ashley is 99.99% responsible for that. Hiring Ashley and Fog City Entertainment made a lot of sense 6 months ago, but now, having seen what she can do for a wedding’s atmosphere and dance floor, it’s a no-brainer. Thank you, Ashley!!

tion. Their intake process for the event timeline and music preferences was impressively thorough and easy to use. It made planning seamless and stress-free. Ashley was fantastic in helping us stay on track leading up to the big day, and our DJ, Jose, brought the energy to the dance floor. He read the crowd well, adapted to last-minute timeline changes, and kept the flow of the evening smooth. The uplighting transformed our reception space beautifully, and the full-service photobooth was a huge hit with our guests. We were even sent a digital copy of all photobooth images following the wedding. We’d highly recommend Fog City to any couple looking for a professional, talented, and fun team to bring their wedding vision to life.

My now-husband and I chose to work with Fog City Entertainment based on the many positive reviews that we researched. They definitely didn't disappoint! We initially met with Ashle...

y to go over our wedding event details and she was able to introduce us to DJ Dan. My husband is very particular about his music choice, and DJ Dan had us dancing the night away. Our general song vibe was to play songs that catered to both our ethnic backgrounds as well as our Bay Area upbringing. The songs that Dan played fit the room so well and each song transitioned perfectly. There was always someone on the dance floor at all times and his charisma and crowd engagement was fun! I also deeply commend his flexibility and adaptability as the wedding itinerary shifted a few times, but the rest of the room couldn't tell. We also had surprise karaoke as a treat and DJ Dan was able sync the videos and audio perfectly! I cannot stress enough the perfection and professionalism of Fog City Entertainment. I will definitely be using them again and have already given referrals/contact info to friends and family at my wedding😁

I could not be happier with our decision to have DJ Ashley as both MC and DJ at our wedding. From our first chat, she was responsive, thorough, and open to any and all ideas we had...

for the day and delivered on everything we asked for! Leading up to our wedding day she took extra care to check in to make sure the day went exactly as we wanted and she was aware of all our song requests and music preferences. She even took the time to visit the venue beforehand to make sure she was prepared to set up all the different areas needing sound and music (ceremony space, reception area, etc.) and placement for the photo booth. The day of, I was confident everything would go smoothly and as planned and I was correct! She handled the flow of all the functions seamlessly from guest entrance music, bridal procession, reception entrance, and speeches. When it came to dancing, she created a perfect mix of all our songs requested and included others that fit our vibe perfectly. It was really special to hear all the songs we love to dance and party to, surrounded with all our friends and family and seeing everyone having a great time. The energy she created not only on the dance floor but throughout the venue for all guests was amazing! Many of our guests told us personally how impressed they were with her, and I couldn’t agree more.

We had DJ Ashley for our wedding and we loved her! A few months before our wedding, my parents kept asking me if they could ask the DJ at their favorite restaurant spot, Pabu Izaka...

ya, to DJ for us but we had already booked Ashley through Fog City! We were so excited to find out that coincidentally, my parents were talking about Ashley the whole time! The planning aspect was super easy and everything went smoothly during the wedding. We also loved how she mashed up our requested songs and the lighting really brought good vibes to the dance floor. So happy we picked Fog City to DJ our wedding and couldn't be happier with our experience with Ashley.

icative in the planning process, answering all of our questions promptly and thoroughly. That was great, as we've never hired a DJ before and had LOTS of questions. It made the decision to hire FCE really easy. Top notch communication continued in the weeks leading up to our wedding. We wanted to include my cousin, who is a musician, in the ceremony music, and he was able to communicate directly with DJ Dan who made it really seamless to include him. At the wedding itself, DJ Dan was flexible and rolled with changes (aka delays) to the timeline, and was responsive to our requests. And he had the dance floor bumping, which was our hope!! I knew my friends would dance, but wasn't sure about my husband's friends or some of our family. I told Dan that my goal was to have all generations on the dance floor, and he made it happen - right up to the end of the evening! We even decided to pay overtime and go past our original end time because the party was still hopping at 10 pm, thanks to Dan! Overall, DJ Dan and FCE met every expectation we had and just made the whole process easy, which is such a blessing during wedding planning - there are so many details to keep track of; it was great to feel like we were in safe hands and didn't have to worry on the music front. Plus, they made it fun! I highly recommend.

Any request we had, she was quick to jump on and try to make it happen! TLDR; she made them all happen! We gave her a rough outline of the vibe we were going for, a list of songs for each area, asked for a Photo Booth with some specifics (she had to work with other vendors that we chose for a flower wall + hanging of a custom sign we made), and she filled everything in with the utmost care! We had a very specific choice of music for our ceremony, and she made it happen beautifully. She was also great with providing lapel mics for our officiant, microphones for the speeches, and of course, an amazing setup for the dance floor! Weddings are always stressful, but choosing Ashley and her team was an incredible decision, and we did not have to stress about it one bit. Thank you again, Ashley and team, for the amazing experience and making our wedding memorable!

dings - they are great! From our first meeting, it was clear we were working with true professionals who deeply understood the art of creating an extraordinary experience. DJ Ashley had an impressive knowledge of music and curated a perfect mix of songs that catered to every guest, blending genres and eras seamlessly. She knew exactly how to keep the energy up, adjusting the playlist in real-time to match the vibe of the crowd, ensuring that the dance floor stayed packed all night. Not only was her mixing skills flawless, but she was also an incredible MC. Ashley guided the event with charm and enthusiasm, making announcements and engaging with guests in a way that felt authentic and fun, yet never overshadowed the main event – us! Her presence was warm, professional, and perfectly in tune with our style. Planning with DJ Ashley was a breeze too. She listened carefully to our preferences and vision, making us feel like our wedding was her top priority. She went above and beyond to incorporate every detail we wanted, including our special songs and moments, making the music feel deeply personal and meaningful. In fact, she even made a couple custom mixes for our first dance and the father-daughter dance - they were perfect! Our timeline ran a little behind, but she adjusted effortlessly, keeping everything flowing smoothly. Sorry - this is sounding like a novel, but we're almost done. Ashley and her assistant's professionalism and reliability were top-notch. Our coordinator loved them too! She said they arrived early, set up flawlessly, and had backup equipment ready (which we thankfully didn’t need, but it was reassuring to know they were prepared for anything!). Their attention to detail and commitment to excellence made us feel completely at ease on our big day. Finally, we can’t say enough about Ashley's ability to create an atmosphere where everyone – even our shyest guests – felt comfortable getting up to dance and celebrate with us. The energy she brought to the room was truly contagious, and we’ve been hearing from guests ever since about how much fun they had.

r breadth of experience made her an absolute breeze to work with, from start to finish. She asks the right questions to ensure she has what she needs from you to be successful and she offers an online portal for you to upload the music you'd like. We found the portal quite helpful, since the forms you need to fill out pose a lot of questions you might not have thought about, like how you want your wedding party to be introduced during their grand entry. A few weeks before our wedding day, Ashley had a call with us to review everything we filled out in the form and to make sure she had everything she needed from us. Once wedding day came along, her and her assistant knew exactly what to do and never had questions for us. She helped keep the day moving with announcements and we trusted her completely. Big thanks to Ashley for her help and expertise! It was a pleasure working with her.

k. I am impressed, not only by her skill, but her professionalism. From our initial Zoom consultation, to mid-way communication to coordinate our monogram, to the end of the reception, I felt like we were in good hand and would not be disappointed. And we weren’t! Ashley even maneuvered around this little “situation” perfectly: My Dad professionally recorded a song to a CD (yes a CD) for our first dance, as a surprise. When my fiancé reached out to Ashley to try and coordinate the switch from the song that we had planned to dance to, to my Dad’s professionally recorded song, they ran into a hiccup. No CD player. Not a problem! Ashley was easily able to make a work around for this and had my fiancé deliver the CD to one of her colleagues who burned it to an MP3 so they could play it at our reception. This extra effort goes above and beyond and shows that Ashley really takes pride in the way she runs her business. Fog City Entertainment is highly recommended!

Not only does she keep the dance floor full but she’s also an exceptional MC who ensures the pace and cadence of the party or reception is perfect. Ashley is fun, lively, professional, engaging, and fully “present” during each and every event and for her all of her clients. I highly recommend hiring Ashley or one of her fabulous teammates.

friendly, professional and experienced, and had lots of recommendations for small things we hadn’t thought of to help make our day go as smoothly as possible. One thing I really appreciated is that she asked early on how much MCing we wanted, and we asked for minimal. The online portal for selecting songs was very intuitive to use, and allowed us to even get songs that were on Youtube and Soundcloud into the mix. The portal has lots of options for customizing your playlist (and do-not playlist), so taking your time and making sure you get everything dialed in can take a bit of time but is worth it. When it came to the day of the wedding, things could not have gone any smoother. They were able to get set up quickly, and ensure that our wireless mics were able to reach all of the places we needed them. During the ceremony, all of the music was perfectly on point. She absolutely NAILED the timing of our recessional song, something that I noticed and appreciated even through the emotion of the moment. The music during the reception was excellent as well - she incorporated all our selected songs with perfect transitions and timing to match the vibe of the night. She also incorporated some suggestions from our guests which was really fun. The audio for the night went on without a hitch. I couldn’t recommend Ashley and Fog City enough!

c about our music choices. It finally felt like we were having a conversation about music instead of a stilted correspondence about pricing. We had a lot of very specific music requests for our wedding (unusual first dance choice, very specific versions of processional songs, etc). Ashley (the owner) and Dave (our DJ) were both so helpful. They put together shortened versions of songs for our first & last dance as well as our father-daughter & mother-son dances, and made sure to work with us to get versions we liked well ahead of our big day! Dave had amazing intuition, playing the perfect songs to get people dancing, and somehow catching the perfect song for my dad right as he walked into cocktail hour (we both teared up). Dave made sure to take care of everything, including announcing our toasts and dances, but most importantly he made sure our wedding was full of music and life!

We highly recommend Fog City Entertainment for their DJ and photobooth services. We decided to book a DJ last minute and Ashley was a lifesaver and a pleasure to work with. Fog Cit...

y has an excellent online system that helps with coordinating the DJ. Everything worked out great. Everything was played at the appropriate time for the processional, cake cutting, recessional, toasts, etc. The processional track that we chose was not long enough, but DJ Garcia was able to extend it flawlessly! He saved the day. DJ Garcia also got everyone dancing with a great choice of music and mood lighting. Thank you!

Ashley is so fantastic! She is so organized, skilled, and reasonably priced. She was masterful at managing the music and pace of the wedding, and worked great with our coordinator....

Real talk, some DJs have strange personalities and energy and it can be weird to have that as the voice of your wedding. But Ashley is the total opposite of that! She instantly made us feel comfortable during our initial call, and continued to provide ease and flexibility up to and throughout our wedding. She also has fanatic suggestions and a great platform for organizing what music you want and when in your wedding. She also has a really great voice when making announcements, even our guests commented on that! Lastly, her assistant was so thoughtful and attentive as well without ever being in the way. What more could anyone ask for? Highly, highly recommend. Oh, and who doesn’t love a woman run business? :)

ss than appropriate at times (100% on them, no fault of Ashley), but she handled everything like a complete pro. We had a few great calls leading up to the event so we felt totally listened to and prepared going into the day with zero stress about music. They listened to exactly what we wanted and not only played the songs we requested, but sprinkled in some requests here and there that made the event perfect music-wise. I had multiple people come up to me at the wedding telling me how great of a job she was doing and asking where we found FCE, so needless to say I would work with this team again in a heartbeat!! And, they also braved a VERY hot day (well into the 90's) which is appreciated in and of itself. Don't wait to book them!

Ashley and her crew at Fog City came highly recommended to us by our equally amazing reception venue team at OVY Camp. Our wedding coordinator also independently recommended her-- ...

and they were both totally right. We were looking for a DJ who could handle more than one location (ceremony site and reception site) in the middle of the forest-- she delivered. We wanted a DJ who understood our taste in music, understood the vibe we were looking for, who we could hand that responsibility to and forget about it -- she totally delivered. We gave specific song requests for certain moments throughout the ceremony and reception using Ashley's planning tool (she executed perfectly), and then we kinda just shared a bunch of Spotify playlists with her and said "This is the music we vibe with. Can you keep people dancing all night?" She nailed it. We had the dance floor packed the ENTIRE NIGHT. And it felt really genuine to our taste. Ashley hit the perfect balance of injecting energy for specific announcements, but never picked up the mic just to hear her own voice. Which was a core value for us. Also-- Ashley is just a genuinely kind person who we enjoyed chatting with at the reception. Real bonus. I hope this is helpful for you as you work to check off those wedding boxes!!

Mike is so amazing and made our big day great! His online portal is super easy to use, and when I did have a few questions, he was able to answer them all. He was wonderful with ...

the music for the ceremony, and the AV requirements we had (we wanted mics for songs, and readings, and our officiants etc) Then he did a great job introducing out HUGE bridal party, and getting everyone pumped and excited. The dancing portion of the evening was truly spectacular, I thought our dance floor would be empty because our friends are not huge dances by boy was I wrong. Mike did a great job getting everyone pumped and out there to dance, and was great at reading the crowd, and keeping the party alive. Wish we could do it again, so I could dance even more!
