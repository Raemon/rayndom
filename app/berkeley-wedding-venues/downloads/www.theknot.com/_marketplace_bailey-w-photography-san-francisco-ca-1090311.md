I love capturing the beauty that surrounds us and creating timeless stories through my photography. My photography has taken me all over the world, including working as a photographer in Puerto Rico. I have been photographing weddings for 6 years now. I enjoy traveling, so no destination is too far when it comes to photography!

TLDR: Biggest thank you to Bailey for the amazing moment you have helped us capture for the rest of our lives - we could not have asked for a better photographer/experience!! Exp...

erience: We reached out to Bailey via email and soon after set up a call to align on the details of our wedding and what was important to us. Bailey was super helpful in perfectly walking the line of hearing our vision while also offering ideas of what to incorporate (ideas we had not thought about but deeply appreciated!). Bailey makes a great sounding board for preparing a photographic vision for your wedding! We aligned on a custom package that best fit our wedding needs (big thank you to Bailey for the flexibility here). Leading up to the wedding, we had clear communication via email and also with a final follow up call to iron out any final details. This led us to feel confident and relaxed about the big day to come! On the day of the wedding, Bailey was punctual, professional, and overall very helpful! She used moments of down time to capture beautiful moments and details. She captured gorgeous pictures of the ceremony - this was done so discreetly that we did not even notice she was there! She offered further suggestions on how we could best leverage the lighting/surrounding space to create pictures that continue to give us goosebumps to this day! We received a sneak preview about a week after the wedding and the rest of the pictures ahead of the contracted schedule. The quality was stunning, the edits were tasteful and subtle, and the eye for detail was perfect. On the day of the wedding, several guests commented on how impressed they were by Bailey's eye for detail and ability to gently direct guests to ensure people looked their best in photos. The online gallery of the pictures in combination with the mailed USB stick was the perfect way to ensure we are able to share and hold onto our pictures forever! Thank you for these two layers.

put our nerves at ease with the whole process. My now husband and I love photos, but doing a bunch of staged, posed photos taking up so much of our reception time was not something that we wanted to worry about, and Bailey certainly got the assignment! The whole day start to finish was documented so beautifully. She captured the essence of our wedding in such a lovely, artistically thoughtful way. So grateful we will have such beautiful photos to see and share for years to come. I heartily recommend Bailey for any event photography!

My husband and I had the pleasure of working with Bailey for our wedding ceremony at SF City Hall. We're both extremely pleased with the experience of working with her, as well as ...

the photos, and would recommend her to anyone! Bailey was great with pre-wedding communication, her prices were extremely reasonable, and her photos were wonderful. She knew the venue well and was able to recommend places for good photos, she kept everyone engaged in the process, an she had dynamic pose recommendations! During the ceremony she was able to blend in and not be distracting while navigating a small space and taking great shots. After the wedding she was timely with providing a digital gallery of our photos, and she even mailed us a nicely packaged USB stick with all of the high-def photos on it. I absolutely recommend her and would work with her again. :)

uring the a wide variety of moments using professional techniques. Her photography exudes experience and her presence at our wedding was confident and seamless. Bailey took the time to get to know me and my fiancé prior to the wedding and develop a photography plan. On the day of the wedding, Bailey was completely professional and unobtrusive. She captured candids of us and made beautiful decisions about lighting and angles. She made sure she knew who the family members were and directed them during the staged photos. I trusted her completely during the entire process. The photos that Bailey took of our wedding are absolutely stunning. The boudoir photos we took prior to the wedding really set the intention of love. Bailey helped us ease into the situation without nerves. She professionally managed family dynamics to ensure that my husband and I could enjoy the day. I was extremely impressed when we received our edited photos in less than a week! If you are looking for a wedding photographer who is talented, experienced, and professional, I highly recommend Bailey W. Photography. You will not be disappointed.

It was such a pleasure to work with Bailey as our wedding photographer. Leading up to the wedding, she was very easy to communicate with, listened to our needs & desires, and offer...

ed helpful suggestions & a plan. Day of the wedding, she arrived when she said she would (early even, I believe), she was patient with us when our schedule was running a little bit behind, and she made me feel super comfortable as I was getting ready to get married. As a photographer, she is excellent! She produced some of the most beautiful photos I have seen, completely capturing the spirit of our ceremony, including all of the tiny details. It was POURING down rain all day and our wedding was OUTSIDE... the rain did not seem to phase her in the slightest. She was well prepared and super professional. I love the way she gently encouraged my husband and I to leave the reception and go off and take some fun photos around sunset (those were my favorite!) but it almost hard to leave everyone and make the time to do so. She was sweet and encouraging, made me feel beautiful again & again, and is wonderful about posing & directing us, since we don't always know what to do in photos. I would DEFINITELY hire her again and highly recommend her. She is so easy to work with and did a seriously excellent job. After the wedding, I think within just a few days, she gave us some teaser photos, and soon after that - all of the photos, and then after that - a printed photo album in the mail! I was surprised by how quickly she got it all done. She has an excellent, easy going attitude, super chill, down to earth, humble, and talented too! My husband and I are so grateful that she photographed our wedding, and that she traveled hours to work in the rain, on an off grid property, as well. Thank you Bailey!!!

If your wedding is going to be anything like mine, it’s going to be hectic. You’ll be moving non-stop from alter to cake cutting and greeting every guest you meet along the way. Yo...

u won’t have time to appreciate all of the little details that you spent the last eight months stressing to perfect. That’s why you hire Bailey Whitehill. She will capture every important moment in all of its natural beauty, leaving nothing forgotten. Her posed pictures are stunning. She has a way of making light and color feel magical, so that even a pale stooge like me looked sharp in a tux and my bride looked more beautiful than ever, but my favorites were the more natural, documentary style photos. You won’t even know she was there until you see the images, but she finds you at all of your best moments. They feel like motion even though they’re stills. Looking at these pictures makes me feel like I’m reliving the best day of my life every time I see them. My advice is that you book her immediately and then pat yourself on the back for a job well done. Now all you have to do is get married!

would be to have Bailey Whitehill as your photographer. Her photos are truly amazing-she has a gift. It is a special gift to give a couple, the ability to see their wedding day from so many perspectives. The ones that are missed, simply by being so overwhelmed with the love and joy that surrounds that special day. Getting our photos back from Bailey was like living the day over again through the eyes of all our guests. Bailey is present, yet she blends into the background. She is professional, but also brings an incredibly calming presence . She listens to your needs and simultaneously brings her own artistic talents to the table. It was a wonderful experience with Bailey as our photographer.
