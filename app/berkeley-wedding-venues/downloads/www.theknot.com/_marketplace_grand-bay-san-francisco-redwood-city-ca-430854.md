We didn't use Grand Bay for the reception, but we did have our hotel block here. We ran into several issues while coordinating and while we there. To start, coordinating with them ...

was very difficult and time consuming. It would take up to a week to a get a response on an email, and we kept being told incorrect information. Second, the link to the room block booking kept running out of rooms even though there were still rooms left on our block. Additionally, the room block price wound up being more expensive then booking other places so several guests booked outside of the block, which didn't count towards our allotment. Some guests additionally experienced issues with not having hot water in their rooms, and the water being shut off without warning. On the positive side, our room itself was very clean and well-maintained, and the staff onsite were very friendly. Additionally the bar and restaurant set up an after party for us, and were great to work with.

We stayed at Pullman the night before our wedding. When we first booke the hotel, we didn't know that it was dog-friendly. We last-minute decided to add our pup to our wedding and ...

was pleasantly surprised when we realized that it was a dog-friendly hotel! The bridal party had two rooms (the boys got a smaller room) and we requested that they be close to each other, but we all spent most of our time in the suite. We had a great time together. The suite was spacious enough for us to do all our hair and makeup there. It was also super beautiful and a great backdrop for our preparation pictures. There were also two weddings going on downstairs. We could hear and see bits and pieces of it. It looked amazing!

Pullman SF Bay is a phenomenal place for a traditional Indian wedding. We had our wedding here a few weeks ago and could not have been happier with the entire process. Stephanie (D...

irector of Catering and Conference Services) went above and beyond in order to make our wedding as amazing as it was. The outdoor dock overlooking the water is beautiful location for a ceremony. It is comfortable for 200 guests and a large mandap. The banquet hall was spacious, revamped with new carpets, well lite, and clean. It never felt crowded with 300 guests, a dance floor. The foyer was used for the cocktail hour, buffet stands, a bar and an area of entertainment vendors which allowed us to create an indoor location for guests to mingle before the reception began. The accommodations within the hotel are 5 star. The suites are spacious, comfortable and well set up. Working with the Pullman and Stephanie was an experience unlike any other, it was smooth and easy. Stephanie was responsive to all emails, requests, questions and concerns we had. She went out of her way to make sure we could do all the traditional rituals (sehra bandi, baraat, phere, etc). They allowed our caterers space to set up their work area, allowed the decorator ample time to set everything up, arranged for parking, water, signage etc for all guests. Working with Stephanie and the entire Pullman staff was a flawless effort. They never once shut down any ideas we had, they held meetings to go over all the plan, they met with all our vendors to ensure there were no issues the day of the event and by the end of the entire planning process, we all felt like nothing could go wrong. Do not hesitate to have you upcoming wedding here, it is a venue with a beautiful outdoor dock, a staff that is professional, polite and easy to work with and a set up that really caters towards all ethnic weddings!

Having the wedding reception at the Sofitel was an overall easy and wonderful experience. Yvonne the wedding coordinator is exceptional, and readily available to answer questions a...

nd offer suggestions. The banquet hall is gorgeous. Only caveat is that the outside of the hotel is decorated with blue and red tile that I find ugly, so we held the cocktail hour inside the building, where the decor is warm and elegant. Only other issue was that we could not get a hotel block, since this was the weekend of Ultra Music Festival.
