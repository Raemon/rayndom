Jawk was absolutely phenomenal as the DJ for our September 2018 wedding! From the very beginning, he was professional, organized, and genuinely passionate about making our day unfo...

rgettable. He took the time to get to know our music tastes, our story, and the kind of energy we wanted for the celebration — and he absolutely delivered. Every transition, announcement, and playlist choice flowed perfectly. Jawk read the crowd like a pro — the dance floor was never empty, and guests of all ages were up and moving all night long. His ability to mix our favorite songs with crowd-pleasing hits made the night feel both personal and full of life. He went above and beyond by coordinating with our coordinator and photographer to make sure key moments — like our grand entrance, first dance, and bouquet toss — were perfectly timed and seamless. The sound quality was excellent, and his setup looked polished and professional. Even years later, our guests still talk about how fun and lively our reception was, and Jawk was a huge part of that. If you’re looking for a DJ who’s talented, reliable, and truly invested in creating the best atmosphere for your wedding, Jawk is the one. We couldn’t have asked for a better DJ and would hire him again in a heartbeat!

We could not be happier with our experience! DJ Jawk DJ’d both my daughter’s school walk-a-thon and my 50th birthday party, and he absolutely delivered for very different crowds an...

d vibes. He is incredibly easy to work with, communicative, and truly understands how to read a room. For my birthday party, he seamlessly mixed music across all genres and age groups and even did an awesome kids music set so everyone felt included. The transitions were smooth, the energy was perfect, and the playlist kept people engaged all night. His pricing is very reasonable, especially considering the quality, professionalism, and versatility he brings. It’s rare to find someone who can handle both a large school event and a milestone birthday with equal skill. Moving forward, he will be our go-to DJ for all parties and events. Highly recommend without hesitation! PS He also had light sticks for the kids to dance with and he provided his own microphone and speakers. Awesome!

Jonny was an incredible DJ and made our wedding weekend unforgettable! He made the entire music-planning process so easy, and on the day of the wedding he delivered exactly what we...

asked for: a fun, playful party vibe that kept everyone dancing. I was fairly specific about our music selections, and Jonny did an amazing job listening and blending all of our different preferences into a seamless soundtrack for the weekend. Our guests had nothing but positive things to say. One moment that stood out was when a special family-tradition song played. Our guests were clearly loving it, and instead of simply replaying the track, Jonny mixed a fresh version on the spot to keep the energy high without breaking the flow. It was incredibly impressive and kept the dance floor packed. He also handled song requests with professionalism - politely turning down choices that didn’t align with our vision while keeping the overall vibe exactly where we wanted it. Throughout the night, Jonny prioritized our preferences, read the room perfectly, and made an outstanding impression on our guests. We couldn’t have asked for a better DJ!

We absolutely love DJ Jawk! While I haven’t personally seen him at a wedding, he is the regular DJ for my daughter’s school events—and he never disappoints. He’s fun, engaging, and...

always knows exactly how to keep the energy going. His song choices are consistently on point and perfectly match the vibe and occasion every single time. The school is so lucky to have him as their house DJ, and I have no doubt he’d bring that same amazing energy and professionalism to any wedding or special event. Highly recommend!

the big day, checking in regularly to make sure we had all our playlists and song selections finalized. He was open to brainstorming and bouncing ideas with us, which made the planning process feel effortless. At the rehearsal, he was professional and easy to work with, coordinating seamlessly with our venue to ensure everything was set up perfectly. On the wedding day itself, he kept the energy flowing all night. He did an excellent job MCing during dinner and keeping guests informed, such as directing everyone through the buffet, while perfectly balancing our music preferences with guest requests. DJ Jawk truly went above and beyond, and we can’t recommend him enough for weddings or any other event where you want great music and great vibes!

DJ Jawk was absolutely amazing to work with! He was so easy to get ahold of and was quick to respond. We met a few times before the big day and dialed in exactly what vibes/genres/...

artists/timing we wanted, and he absolutely crushed it from beginning to end. Not only was the music perfect, but his MC abilities fit our day perfectly. He was funny when he needed to be, sincere when the time called for it and the timing of everything was right on. I can't recommend Jawk enough. Hire him for your event now, and thank me later!

l, punctual, and caring, he was great with our guests. His superpower is reading the room and knowing exactly what to play even before you realized you needed it. Jawk is also get with getting to know our tastes and playing songs that were personal to us. Highly recommend. 10/10 we love him.

Stop reading this and hire Jonny right now! He’s hands down the greatest wedding DJ of all time. My wife and I hired him for our wedding back in 2017, and since then we’ve referred...

him to more than ten of our friends’ weddings. Every single one of them has loved him. It says a lot that every time Jonny DJs a wedding, he ends up getting more referrals on the spot because of how good he is. He’s an incredible communicator before the event, listens carefully to what you want, and is completely reliable and adaptable. On the music side, he’s a true DJ with real technical skills, clean transitions, and playlists that feel like an actual club experience, not a cheesy wedding set. He takes direction well, adds his own creative flair, and reads the room perfectly so the whole night flows seamlessly. His mic work and crowd energy are top-notch too. If you’re a DJ, stop searching and book this legend!!!
