Christina is just outright AMAZING!! We had an engagement session as we are using her for our wedding and let me just say if you want fun and real, use her because you won’t regret...

it. I have had bad experiences in the past with photographers and Christina just blurred all those experiences out. From the very beginning, her personality and whole ora is so enlightening and fun, and she’s just real. You can tell that she is passionate and loves what she does. I’m not one to feel uncomfortable as easily as my fiancé is especially when it comes to a camera being involved. He’s not a picture person, as most guys aren’t. But seeing how he loosened up and was able to be more himself this time around was so amazing to me. And his words when I asked what he thought of the experience…he was like oh she’s so dope. For the location, it was perfect! She had many options on a whim when traffic put us in a bind. It was just great. Once we got to the location, she cared about our surroundings and all the little angles and details. When shooting she always knew what to say and how to fix things, and just made it be known to be comfortable. I have some photos from last experience to where we looks stiff. But Christina really helped direct us and just encouraged us to move in natural ways to be ourselves. Her photos express and show how we really are. The serious side, the flirty side, and the playful side. She got us in the moment just being us, and it felt like she wasn’t even there. I’m huge with personality, and I’m huge with connection. And when I feel good with people around me, I can be myself as well as with my fiancé. Now down the road with kids and just life events to come, I know that my soon to be husband won’t ever be jumping with joy to take photos lol but I know that when those moments get to be captured he would choose Christina any day, as would I. I have bragged so much about the experience so far to so many. And I cannot wait to brag more with our wedding photos.

LOVED christina's end result photos (looked like they belong in a magazine), working style (super direct and take-charge) and professionalism (quick responses, honest but respectfu...

l opinions). The photos themselves are everything i wanted, and i am very picky about my photos and how i look. she got every single "must have" photo on my list but what we ended up loving most are the in-the-moment ones she got on her own. I really appreciated her style - she's incredibly direct and no-nonsense. I wanted someone to be able to both be "invisible" and capture candid moments but also give me super specific direction so the photos turned out good. She would arrange people for group shots "you stand here, you stand there, you step 6 inches forward, you get that hand out of your pocket" and for my boudoir she would tell me what to do with my face so i didn't look like a wanna-be model that ends up looking like she's trying too hard. "chin 1 inch down, back more arched, right toe off the ground, smile less". she helped me get angles and shots of my body i wouldnt have ever been able to think of myself. i recommend her to all my friends - do it!

I cannot express how amazing Christina is and my experience with CM Elle Studios. She was our photographer at my wedding in September 2023 in St Helena. Of course our pictures turn...

ed out absolutely stunning (like legitimately started bawling when I saw them because they captured the day so beautifully) BUT what I love about her is how comfortable she makes you feel in front of the camera. I am completely camera shy, but there was no moment at all where I felt awkward. Christina is freakin’ hilarious and will make you cry laugh like no else else. She is incredibly professional, prompt and efficient. I seriously cannot recommend Christina enough, you all need to hire her because you will not regret it!!!!

I absolutely couldnt have asked for a better photographer and experience! Christina and her team made our family and bride/groom experience so easy and FUN! Our photos turned out S...

O INCREDIBLE that you could literally FEEL the wedding through the photos. I would change nothing --- Christina was able to pull out our emotions through each and every photo. We had Christina do our Welcome Party as well as our Wedding and we will cherish these photos forever! I also hope to have her photograph future lifetime events <3 and stay friends for a very long time!
