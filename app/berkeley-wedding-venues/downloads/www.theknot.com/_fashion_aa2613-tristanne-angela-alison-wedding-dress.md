Description

With our high-neck short wedding dress Tristanne, every petal is designed for brides who crave romance with a touch of drama. Her halter neckline balances the flirty A-line silhouette, while dimensional floral lace appliques dance across her in a way that the blooms come alive. Her matching veil (V2625C) echoes her floral motif, completing a look that feels effortlessly classic yet unforgettable. She would be perfect for a bride who wants her walk down the aisle to feel like stepping into a secret garden.
