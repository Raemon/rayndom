When it comes to your wedding day look, every meticulous detail makes a statement of its own, from head to toe. But if there's one rule to heed, it's to make sure your day-of jewelry is complementing your dress—not outshining it. Not sure where to start? Take your cues from the neckline. From sweeping off-the-shoulder silhouettes to romantic sweetheart designs, we're spilling the tea on all the ways you can bling out on your big day. Keep reading for a breakdown of the most popular wedding dress necklines and our [Blue Nile](https://www.bluenile.com/jewelry) picks to go with each.

## Strapless

![Blue Nile Illusion Lab-Grown Diamond Drop Earrings,  Blue Nile Lab-Grown Diamond Mini Half Tennis Bracelet with Round Bezel Setting,  Blue Nile Lab-Grown Diamond Oval-Cut Solitaire Pendant](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/a7fa8346-15b0-47bd-9fbc-7239f00fd0a3~rs_768.h)

This style naturally accentuates the shoulder and collarbone, so use your jewels to not only highlight those features, but to bring attention back to your face. An updo, like a classic bun or messy chignon, allows you to keep the emphasis on the finer details of your day-of look, like a dazzling pair of drop earrings, half tennis bracelet and delicate necklace.

Style it with:

  1. **Blue Nile**[Illusion Lab-Grown Diamond Drop Earrings](https://www.bluenile.com/jewelry/earrings/illusion-drop-earrings-with-lab-grown-diamonds-in-14k-white-gold-item-296245)

  2. **Blue Nile**[Lab-Grown Diamond Mini Half Tennis Bracelet with Round Bezel Setting](https://www.bluenile.com/jewelry/bracelets/mini-half-tennis-bracelet-with-050-ctw-round-partial-bezel-lab-grown-diamonds-in-14k-white-gold-item-296385)

  3. **Blue Nile**[Lab-Grown Diamond Oval-Cut Solitaire Pendant](https://www.bluenile.com/jewelry/necklaces/oval-cut-lab-grown-diamond-solitaire-pendant-in-14k-white-gold-1-ct-tw-f-g-vs2-si1-item-251216)




## **One-Shoulder**

![Blue Nile Pear-Cut Lab-Grown Diamond Stud Earrings and Blue Nile Illusion Lab-Grown Diamond Bangle Bracelet](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/7cc32f4c-b59f-4cc5-b262-307019798996~rs_768.h)

This asymmetric style makes a statement all on its own, so balance is key. Sweep your hair off your neck in a sleek pony for a seamless 360-degree view of the single-shoulder design, and opt for a pair of sparkly studs to direct eyes back to your smile. Add a bangle bracelet on the bare arm and your final look will be *chef's kiss*.

Style it with:

  1. **Blue Nile**[Pear-Cut Lab-Grown Diamond Stud Earrings](https://www.bluenile.com/jewelry/earrings/pear-cut-lab-grown-diamond-stud-earrings-in-14k-white-gold-2-ct-tw-f-g-vs2-si1-item-251895)

  2. **Blue Nile**[Illusion Lab-Grown Diamond Bangle Bracelet](https://www.bluenile.com/jewelry/bracelets/illusion-bangle-bracelet-with-lab-grown-diamonds-in-14k-white-gold-7-item-296233)




## **V-Neck or Plunge**

![Blue Nile Lab-Grown Diamond Oval-Cut Stud Earrings, Blue Nile Lab-Grown Diamond Wire Basket Pendant,  Blue Nile Mini Half Tennis Bracelet with Oval-Cut Lab-Grown Diamonds](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/10621d61-b55a-4319-8f81-0968433de18f~rs_768.h)

Here, the emphasis of the design is on the décolletage. A pendant necklace naturally mimics the shape of the plunging neckline. Style your hair away from your face in a whimsical braid or half-up, half-down 'do, and balance it all out with simple stud earrings and a half tennis bracelet.

Style it with:

  1. **Blue Nile**[Lab-Grown Diamond Oval-Cut Stud Earrings](https://www.bluenile.com/jewelry/earrings/oval-cut-lab-grown-diamond-stud-earrings-in-14k-white-gold-3-ct-tw-f-g-vs2-si1-item-251877)

  2. **Blue Nile**[Lab-Grown Diamond Wire Basket Pendant](https://www.bluenile.com/jewelry/necklaces/wire-basket-lab-grown-diamond-pendant-in-14k-white-gold-1-ct-tw-f-g-vs2-si1-item-251468)

  3. **Blue Nile**[Mini Half Tennis Bracelet with Oval-Cut Lab-Grown Diamonds](https://www.bluenile.com/jewelry/bracelets/mini-half-tennis-bracelet-with-2-ctw-oval-cut-lab-grown-diamonds-in-14k-yellow-gold-item-296401)




## **High-Neck**

![Blue Nile Mini Half Tennis Bracelet with Emerald-Cut Lab-Grown Diamonds, Blue Nile Inside Out Lab-Grown Diamond Hoop Earrings, Blue Nile Illusion Lab-Grown Diamond Ring ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/adbde8a8-47a9-456a-82f2-9113b82ca044~rs_768.h)

With the chest and neck covered, skip the necklace in favor of accessories that will draw the eye back up to your face. If you're toying with the idea of an updo, opt for a pair of statement earrings, like hoops or dangling studs, and maximize your sparkle with a tennis bracelet and optional cocktail ring to round out the look.

Style it with:

  1. **Blue Nile**[Mini Half Tennis Bracelet with Emerald-Cut Lab-Grown Diamonds](https://www.bluenile.com/jewelry/bracelets/mini-half-tennis-bracelet-with-2-ctw-emerald-cut-lab-grown-diamonds-in-14k-white-gold-item-296387)

  2. **Blue Nile**[Inside Out Lab-Grown Diamond Hoop Earrings](https://www.bluenile.com/jewelry/earrings/inside-out-emerald-cut-lab-grown-diamond-hoop-earrings-in-14k-white-gold-2-ct-tw-f-g-vs2-si1-item-251166)

  3. **Blue Nile**[Illusion Lab-Grown Diamond Ring](https://www.bluenile.com/jewelry/rings/illusion-ring-with-lab-grown-diamonds-in-14k-white-gold-item-296221)




## **Sweetheart**

![Blue Nile Illusion Lab-Grown Diamond Necklace, Blue Nile Illusion Lab-Grown Diamond Stud Earrings,  Blue Nile Lab-Grown Diamond Mini Half Tennis Bracelet with Round Bezel Setting](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/89aabb48-e092-49ba-bce1-a6c2923c42c2~rs_768.h)

Timeless and romantic, the sweetheart offers an ultra-feminine shape, following the natural outline of a heart. This classic style offers lots of flexibility when it comes to hair and accessories, but we're partial to elegant brushed-out waves and delicate adornments. Pro tip: Choose a short pendant or station necklace that splays across the collarbone for perfect proportions.

Style it with:

  1. **Blue Nile**[Illusion Lab-Grown Diamond Necklace](https://www.bluenile.com/jewelry/necklaces/illusion-lab-grown-diamond-necklace-in-14k-white-gold-item-296225)

  2. **Blue Nile**[Illusion Lab-Grown Diamond Stud Earrings](https://www.bluenile.com/jewelry/earrings/illusion-stud-earrings-with-lab-grown-diamonds-in-14k-white-gold-item-296247)

  3. **Blue Nile**[Lab-Grown Diamond Mini Half Tennis Bracelet with Round Bezel Setting](https://www.bluenile.com/jewelry/bracelets/mini-half-tennis-bracelet-with-050-ctw-round-partial-bezel-lab-grown-diamonds-in-14k-white-gold-item-296385)




## **Off-the-Shoulder**

![Blue Nile Mini Half Tennis Bracelet with Marquise-Cut Diamonds,  Blue Nile Marquise-Cut Lab-Grown Diamond Stud Earrings](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/941c8670-28b5-453a-82aa-4aad0689bf8f~rs_768.h)

A sweeping off-the-shoulder neckline offers a glamorous, old Hollywood feel, so naturally the jewels should match. A pair of marquise-cut studs or simple drop earrings play into the vintage vibe, and a classic tennis bracelet speaks for itself. For this (and boatneck styles), choose a hairstyle that will further highlight your shoulders and collarbone.

Style it with:

  1. **Blue Nile**[Mini Half Tennis Bracelet with Marquise-Cut Diamonds](https://www.bluenile.com/jewelry/bracelets/mini-half-tennis-bracelet-with-2-ctw-marquise-cut-diamonds-in-14k-yellow-gold-item-296404?srsltid=AfmBOorwpbVh-Z_J9-Z3qi0TzLYkzX1Vkl2Gza8OPpRdCjOSqj13ExHq)

  2. **Blue Nile**[Marquise-Cut Lab-Grown Diamond Stud Earrings](https://www.bluenile.com/jewelry/earrings/marquise-cut-lab-grown-diamond-stud-earrings-in-14k-white-gold-2-ct-tw-f-g-vs2-si1-item-251914)
