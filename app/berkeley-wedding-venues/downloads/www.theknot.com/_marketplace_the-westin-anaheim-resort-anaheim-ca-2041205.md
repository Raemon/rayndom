We recently had our rehearsal dinner and wedding at The Westin Anaheim Resort, and both events exceeded our expectations! The rehearsal dinner took place on the Jewel Floor, a priv...

ate rooftop space with an amazing view of Disneyland. The food was absolutely spectacular and set the perfect tone for our wedding weekend. The wedding venue itself is exceptional in every way. It's a brand new, luxurious, and spacious space that felt like a dream come true. Every single staff member, from the bartenders to the servers, security, front desk, and valet, was incredibly friendly, professional, and attentive. We opted for passed hors d'oeuvres, a plated dinner, and late-night bites, and everything was delicious. The service was prompt, and the quality of the food was outstanding. The bar package offered great options, and the bartenders were quick and made delicious drinks. One of the highlights of our experience was working with Shannon, the banquet manager. She made the entire wedding planning process easy and smooth, taking a lot of stress off our plates. Her expertise and enjoyable personality were invaluable, and we couldn't have asked for a better person to work with. The accommodations at The Westin were also incredibly comfortable. We and our guests felt well taken care of throughout our stay. Overall, The Westin Anaheim Resort is truly the perfect choice for a dream wedding. We highly recommend it to anyone looking for an exceptional venue and experience.
