Working with Amanda Monroe was hands-down one of the best decisions we made during our wedding planning process. With a destination wedding with family members at all corners of th...

e world, logistics and organization were immediately overwhelming for us. From the moment she stepped in, she brought a sense of calm, clarity, and professionalism that instantly put us at ease. Her thoughtful approach, attention to detail, and warm energy allowed us to be fully present on our big day—something truly priceless. Amanda has that rare gift of making everything feel effortless, even behind the scenes. She handled timelines, vendors, and last-minute logistics with grace and precision, all while making us feel like we were her top priority. Whether you’re getting married in a vineyard, your own backyard, or on a rooftop with city views, Amanda and A-game and will your vision to life beautifully and seamlessly. We can’t recommend her enough—she’s a dream to work with and an absolute gem in the wedding and event world. She literally made our day more incredible than we could have ever hoped! Thanks again so much

I absolutely love working with Amanda. She’s detailed, flexible, thoughtful and leaves ego at the door. She centers decisions and actions around creating the best day for her bride...

and groom. She is respectful and can even help you navigate relationships and frustrations that arise. Don’t be surprised if you want to be her friend by the end of the day!
