## Bridal Shower Registry Wording

After you've gathered the [best wedding registry items](https://www.theknot.com/content/best-wedding-registry-ideas) for you and your spouse-to-be, it's time to let your loved ones know where to look before your shower. Getting your wedding shower registry wording just right is about striking the right tone. Let guests know you appreciate anything they bring, especially their presence. You can also find ways to incorporate your theme or humor into the wording, like with pop culture references or clever wedding rhymes. (Think about adding these motifs in your [DIY wedding shower invitations](https://www.theknot.com/content/printable-bridal-shower-invites), too, to prepare guests for the theme.)

In your [bridal shower invitation wording](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-shower-invitation-wording-ideas) or on your registry website, consider [asking bridal shower guests to ship gifts](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-gifts-telling-guests-where-to-ship) instead of bringing them, especially if they're traveling for the shower. Here are some ideas to jumpstart your bridal shower gift registry wording.

  * _Help us start our new life together! We are registered at Crate & Barrel, and we appreciate any thoughtful gift for our home._
  * _Your presence at our shower is the greatest gift of all! If you'd like to bless us with a gift, however, you can find our registry through Bloomingdale's._
  * _Every new adventure needs the right essentials, which is why we've registered at Target. We welcome any gift, even just seeing you at our wedding shower._
  * _Let's shower the bride with love, neatly wrapped in a bow. You can find the couple's wedding registry online at Amazon, and we can't wait to see you at the shower._
  * _Gifts are never expected, but if you want to bless us with something special, check out our registry at Williams Sonoma._
  * _We're so grateful for all of the love and support. If you want to help us celebrate at our bridal shower, we're registered at Sur la Table and Belk._
  * _Something old and something new is needed for our life as two! To celebrate our upcoming nuptials, we are registered at Etsy. Anything is appreciated for our new venture._
  * _I found my lobster—please help us set up the tank! Say, "I'll be there for you," by joining us for our bridal shower. We're registered at Pottery Barn for all of our married-life needs._
  * _Pop the bubbly… I'm getting a hubby. If you'd like to celebrate with us at our wedding shower, our registry is at West Elm._



## No Bridal Shower Registry Wording 

If you're throwing a bridal shower with no registry, there are ways to get this across to guests. As for [requesting cash wedding gifts](https://www.theknot.com/content/asking-for-money-wedding-gifts) or finding the right honeymoon fund wording, we've got a few ideas to help. You can also leave QR codes around your wedding shower venue for your honeymoon fund, charities of your choice, or even gift card options to help fund your new life together. Sometimes, guests just want to ensure they're contributing in some way, so another idea is to make your wedding shower a potluck, and everyone can bring their favorite recipe cards to fill a new cookbook for you and your spouse-to-be.

Another fun and creative option is a [bridal shower wishing well](https://www.theknot.com/content/wishing-well-instead-of-registry), where guests can drop in coins, gift cards and cash. If opening gifts in front of guests gives you a little anxiety, consider a [display shower](https://www.theknot.com/content/display-shower) for your cash and gift cards. There are plenty of ways to make this prewedding event work for you and your needs. Just ensure you're giving guests the heads up ahead of time. Here are some prompts for your bridal shower no registry wording.

  * _The best gift you can bring is yourself. Celebrate with us at our wedding shower—no gifts, please._
  * _We're only asking for one gift for our bridal shower… you! Please bless us with your presence to help celebrate this new chapter in our lives._
  * _Instead of gifts, we'd love it if you considered donating to one of these charities in our honor: (name), (name) and (name). And we hope to see you at our shower._
  * _Your love and support are all we need, so no gifts, please. If you want to contribute to our honeymoon fund, you can here: (website)_
  * _The only gift we need is making memories together. Please join us for our bridal shower for good food, good vibes and good times._
  * _We're overflowing with love and need no extra gifts, so please consider donating to a charity in our honor!_
  * _We are lucky to have everything we need, but if you wish to give something, a small contribution to our next big adventure would be truly appreciated._
  * _Wrap yourself in a bow and consider that our wedding gift. All jokes aside, no gifts are required—only your presence._
  * _Be our guest, be our guest—but leave the gifts, we're all set!_
