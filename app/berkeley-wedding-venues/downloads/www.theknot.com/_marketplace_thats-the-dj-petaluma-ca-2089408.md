mony to dinner and the dance floor, had perfectly timed musical moments and clear audio. From the start, he kept in close touch helped us build a playlist that really felt like us. For the portions where we hadn’t chosen every track, he filled in with songs that matched the vibe perfectly. The dance floor was an absolute blast thanks to his instincts and great energy, so many of our guests commented after the wedding how great he was. We’re so grateful we had Alex as our DJ - we can’t recommend him enough!

Alex dj'ed our wedding two weeks ago and we are extremely happy we found and booked his company. He did an incredible job, he went through all of our songs and made an incredible ...

mix that went with the ebbs and flows of the evening. Everyone gave us compliments about the music and many of our guests did not want to leave the dance floor! Alex has a great voice and wasn't just the DJ, he was the MC of the evening as well, and he worked with us every step of the way in curating the evenings experience. He was available to us throughout the process of planning the wedding, which was stressful but he reassured us and came up with solutions for timing problems and really helped us throughout the process we cannot be more happy with his work and we would recommend his service to anyone looking to plan an event!

Working with Thats the Dj was great. From Alex responding promptly to our request, their availability, and quote to assigning us Dj David. Dj David was great in guiding us through...

the entire process, to asking all the pertinent questions we may not have thought of. What was even better was the fact that they are bilingual, this was important to us for our elders who are predominantly Spanish speakers. Interaction the day of was great Dj David was jovial, had the crowd dancing all night and accommodated any last minute requests. Overall our experience was beyond great with this team. We had a seamless and pleasant experience and would highly recommend them for any wedding.

e evident. The music was absolutely perfect. The dance floor was packed all night and our guests are still talking about how much fun they had. They worked seamlessly with our musicians, creating a smooth and coordinated flow throughout the evening. Every transition felt natural and well-timed, which helped the entire celebration run effortlessly. In addition to the music, the photo booth they provided was a huge hit! It added so much fun and energy to the night, and guests absolutely loved it. At the end of the evening, everyone received access to the full gallery, a wonderful collection of candid, hilarious, and heartfelt moments from the booth. It was such a thoughtful touch that gave our guests an extra keepsake from the celebration. We couldn’t have asked for a better experience and highly recommend That’s The DJ to anyone looking to elevate their event with exceptional music amazing photos and service. Thank you for being such an important part of our special day!

J Luis for our wedding, and from start to finish, he was phenomenal. He really took the time to understand our vision, helped us craft a seamless plan, and on the big day, he executed everything flawlessly. He was punctual, professional, and made sure every moment flowed smoothly — from keeping the schedule on track to guiding guests effortlessly throughout the event. His music selection was spot on, perfectly balancing Spanish and English tracks to keep all our guests on the dance floor. The energy never dipped, and the party was so amazing that we didn’t want it to end — we even extended by an extra hour! DJ Luis helped make our wedding unforgettable. We can't recommend him highly enough!
