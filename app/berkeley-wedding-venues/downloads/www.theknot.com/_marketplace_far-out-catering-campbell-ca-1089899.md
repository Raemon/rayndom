We chose Far Out catering originally because 1. We couldn’t stop salivating over the delicious mushroom ravioli after our tasting; and 2. We immediately felt comfortable with Carla...

– we loved her personality and story. I worked in food service for about a decade so the food and beverage service for our wedding was very important to me. We are SO glad that we went with Far Out. Carla and her team were absolutely amazing at every step of the process. I’ll give a few examples: 1\. Taste: So many of our guests told us that this was by far the BEST food they have ever had at a wedding. People were literally searching us out to tell us this because they were so impressed. There’s always the fear that the food won’t taste as good as it did at the tasting, but despite the fact that we were in a county park and there was no onsite kitchen, the food tasted just as we remembered it. 2\. Service: The team was so on top of everything and just generally so sweet that it created a great ambiance for the wedding. We missed the appetizers due to taking photos and were a bit disappointed. Carla found out and the team quickly made us a personal platter of each of the appetizers. Carla was communicative, but not overbearing and made us feel that everything was in good hands. For example, during the wedding we made some slight changes in timing because people were loving the appetizers and cocktail hour, so we pushed back dinner about 30 minutes. Carla and her team worked it out seamlessly and no one knew that there was a change except for us. 3\. Above and beyond: We bought all of our own alcohol and mixers and the team came by our house a couple of days before to pick everything up so that we didn’t have to drop it off. Amidst all of the last minute to-dos, this was a huge help. Later that night, as Carla was looking through the items, she realized that I had forgotten to pick up lychee for our signature cocktail. She communicated with me and I said that I would work on quickly trying to find it the following day. What I didn’t say is that I was nervous that I wouldn’t find it due to the holiday—and not sure how we could pivot because they’d already finalized the printed menus. Before I even had time to look, Carla texted me early the following morning and said she had found the item and already picked it up, so I didn’t need to worry about it. We definitely made the right decision going with Far Out. I honestly wish they had a restaurant so I could eat that ravioli again! 😊

e wedding how amazing everything was. Having them also staff the bar was a great decision, as they were able to move personnel around throughout the event as needed. The wedding was a backyard wedding, which was more complex for them, but they did an excellent job preparing and executing everything we needed. Carla was great to work with leading up to the event. She was always available, on top of the details, and was a pleasure to work with. We would highly recommend Carla and team to anyone looking for a delicious and professional catering company.

We had a wonderful experience with Far Out Catering for our wedding in June! Carla was so professional, helpful, and positive throughout the planning process, and she and her team ...

helped make the wedding day go so smoothly. She worked with us to create a custom menu that fit our theme and vision, and executed it all beautifully. The food was exactly what we wanted (flavorful, fresh, plant-based options, with lots of seasonal summer fruits and veggies), and the cake was stunning. Not only were they beautiful, but the food and cake were SO delicious! We got many compliments from our guests raving about the amazing food and service. We are so happy we chose Far Out Catering for our wedding - they truly made our day just that much more special.

esponsiveness and attention to detail is unmatched. Some highlights from our experience with her: \- We needed shade last minute and were worried tents would make the setting ugly. She recommended umbrellas, got them ordered for us, and they looked gorgeous and fit our setting perfectly. \- She has great style so we gave her just one picture of a bouquet we wanted and she made it happen and then matched all the flower and decor to it. \- Her team is so professional and nice! They went around pouring drinks, which we didn’t expect but greatly appreciated, and they cleaned up our kitchen and took the trash with them. Our house was spotless after!

We loved working with Far Out Catering! They catered our mini wedding in 2021 and also recently catered our 100+ person baby shower in Jan 2024 and everything went super smoothly a...

t both events. For our mini wedding in 2021, they provided delicious boxed lunches + desserts for our families and helped create a stunning wedding cake (only the top layer was real food, bottom tiers were for staging only) that looked amazing in photos. For our larger baby shower just recently, they provided a gorgeous grazing table full of amazing charcuterie and snacks, 3 different types of warm appetizers, and a beautiful spread of assorted desserts, tarts and cookies. Guests were raving about the food + presentation and it was such a comfort having Carla and Kiah’s warm and professional presence at this major life milestone. We originally met this dream team in early 2020 when we were looking for wedding vendors and were immediately impressed with their professionalism, friendliness and talent (aka delicious food) from the first time we met them for our tasting. When COVID hit just a few months later, they were super understanding and flexible; it truly felt like we were all on the same team and that we were navigating the unknowns together. We ended up having to reschedule our event twice and still ended up with a smaller-than-planned family-only wedding ceremony. Through all the ups and downs of the entire covid-wedding-planning experience, they maintained positivity and stayed focused on providing the best service to us, no matter what that looked like. We were so happy to have another excuse to work with them more recently to finally share their amazingness with a larger group of our friends and family. It was definitely worth the wait and we hope to be able to work with them again for other milestones in our lives moving forward. Thank you!!!

We had the pleasure of having Far Out Catering cater our wedding and we have absolutely no regrets! My husband and I adopted a vegan lifestyle over five years ago, so it was very ...

important to us to be able to offer delicious vegan food on our wedding day. It was a challenge finding a catering company that would accommodate a 100% vegan menu that consisted of food that non-vegans would enjoy as well. As soon as we spoke with Carla, she presented her initial ideas to us and we knew immediately we had found what we were searching for! Our plated dinner consisted of two DELICIOUS pasta options, and various appetizers such as bruschetta, jackfruit tostadas, and papas a la huancaina. And yes… ALL VEGAN. Even down to the parmesan cheese! In addition to the food, Far Out Catering supplied the rentals for tables, chairs, tableware, and linens. They were able to easily collaborate with our wedding designer to ensure that our wedding was perfect! On the day of the wedding, everything went smoothly. The food came out on time and all of our guests were raving about the delicious vegan food!The staff was helpful, attentive, and courteous and it was an absolute pleasure working with Carla and Kiah! We can’t thank them enough! HERE’S YOUR SIGN TO WORK WITH FAR OUT CATERING FOR ALL YOUR CATERING NEEDS :)
