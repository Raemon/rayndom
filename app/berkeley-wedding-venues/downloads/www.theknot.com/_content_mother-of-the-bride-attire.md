## What Does the Mother of the Bride Wear?

If you thought mother-of-the-bride attire was limited to frumpy, matronly or overly conservative styles, we're here to assure you that that's simply not the case. Outfits for mothers of the bride have changed a lot over the years. These days, moms are encouraged to wear whatever makes them feel the most confident, whether that's a sleek evening gown, a trendy midi dress, a dressy [jumpsuit](https://www.theknot.com/content/mother-of-the-bride-jumpsuits) or even a [chic MOB pantsuit](https://www.theknot.com/content/mother-of-the-bride-pant-suits). 

In addition to making them feel great, mothers' wedding attire should also fit the vision that the couple has in mind for their big day. Julie Sabatino, bridal stylist and founder of [The Stylish Bride](https://thestylishbride.com/), recommends taking the [wedding dress code](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-guest-attire-cheat-sheet), season and venue into account when picking out wedding attire for the mother of the bride. These three factors can help determine how formal your outfit should be. 

FEATURED VIDEO FROM THE KNOT

As a general rule of thumb, [black-tie](https://www.theknot.com/content/what-to-wear-black-tie) and [formal weddings](https://www.theknot.com/content/formal-wedding-attire) call for floor length gowns. We often see moms gravitate towards sheath and A-line silhouettes for these types of settings. [Cocktail](https://www.theknot.com/content/cocktail-wedding-attire) and [semi-formal](https://www.theknot.com/content/what-to-wear-semi-formal) events open the door for jacket dresses, jumpsuits and [tea-length](https://www.theknot.com/content/tea-length-mother-of-the-bride-dresses) silhouettes. For [casual weddings](https://www.theknot.com/content/what-to-wear-casual), we see moms take a more elevated approach to their everyday style. Think: Stylish separates and festive frocks. The dress code for mothers of the bride usually leans a bit more formal since they're members of the wedding party and typically walk down the aisle. Some of our favorite [mother-of-the-dress trends](https://www.theknot.com/content/mother-of-the-bride-dress-trends) for this year include one-shoulder dresses, embellished dresses and dresses featuring embellishments and beadwork.

## What Color Does the Mother of the Bride Wear?

So, we've covered dress length, style and silhouette, but what color does the bride's mother wear? The truth is that there's not one traditional mother-of-the-bride dress color. Some couples choose to have their moms coordinate with the rest of the party by wearing a dress in a similar shade to the bridesmaids' (more on that later). Other couples encourage their mothers to pick a dress in a color of their choosing. Shades like navy blue and burgundy are classic options for moms, no matter the season. Multicolored gowns in festive floral prints have also become more popular in recent years. The best color for mothers of the bride, however, is the one that makes her feel her best.

### Can the mother of the bride wear black? What about white?

It's totally acceptable for the mother of the bride to [wear black to a wedding](https://www.theknot.com/content/should-guests-wear-black-or-white), especially if the dress code is black-tie. However, moms should always consult the bride beforehand and consider the venue, vibe and season. If the wedding color scheme consists of bright, punchy hues, the bride might request they wear a style in a coordinating shade.

White, on the other hand, is almost always a no-go. Unless you've received approval from the couple, it's best to steer clear from [wearing white](https://www.theknot.com/content/wearing-white-to-wedding), [ivory](https://www.theknot.com/content/ivory-vs-white-wedding-dress) or champagne hues as not to take attention away from the bride.

### Can the mother of the bride and groom wear the same color?

The mother of the bride and the mother of the groom shouldn't wear the exact same dress. They each have their own unique sense of style and their outfits should be a reflection of that. However, to add an element of coordination, they _could_ wear different dresses in the same color (but it's not required by any means). **Psst:** Check out our helpful guide on [attire for the mother of the groom](https://www.theknot.com/content/mother-of-the-groom-attire) for more helpful tips.

### Can the mother of the bride wear the same color as bridesmaids?

While there's no hard and fast rule stating that the mother of the bride's dress color should be the same as the bridesmaids', many couples do encourage their moms to choose a coordinating look. If the bridal party is wearing [mismatched dresses](https://www.theknot.com/content/mismatched-bridesmaids-dress-tips), the mother of the bride can easily find a look that complements them. If the bridesmaids are all wearing the same color, the mother of the bride should look for a dress in a compatible hue. Of course, it's also fine for the mother of the bride to opt for an outfit that doesn't match the bridesmaids or the [wedding color scheme](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-color-inspiration-boards), if that's what the couple prefers.

## Mother-of-the-Bride Outfit Shopping Etiquette

Finding an outfit the mother of the bride will love doesn't have to be a difficult task. In fact, when you understand mother-of-the-bride attire etiquette, it can actually be quite simple. Follow the tips below for a seamless shopping experience.

### Does the mother of the bride choose her outfit first?

"Traditional etiquette holds that the mother of the bride picks their dress before the mother of the groom," says Sabatino. Her selection should help guide the mother of the groom's dress choice. "They don't have to match, but they should coordinate to some extent," Sabatino adds.

### Does the bride pick the mother of the bride's dress?

Choosing mother-of-the-bride attire should be a collaborative effort. While the couple will likely have ideas and opinions about their mothers' wedding attire, moms should have the final say since they'll be the ones actually wearing it. 

### Who pays for wedding attire for the mother of the bride?

Traditionally, the mother of the bride pays for her own wedding attire. Unless the couple has stated otherwise, the MOB should be prepared to cover the cost of her dress.
