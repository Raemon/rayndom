When it comes to finding the perfect engagement ring, carat size is a key characteristic to consider. As one of the 4Cs of diamonds, carat denotes the weight of the stone, which can dramatically impact its cost and the overall look. So, if you're trying to narrow down the ideal ring size for your budget and style, it can be helpful to see different diamond carat sizes on a hand.

Since an engagement ring often comes with a higher price tag, it's important to do your research ahead of time to ensure you're making the right decision. To help, we're taking the guesswork out of carat sizes. We've tapped jewelry experts to share everything you need to know about different diamond carat sizes, along with photos of diamond carat sizes on a real hand to help make an educated choice.

## What is a Carat?

Whether you're a diamond expert or a novice to the fine jewelry industry, it's important to understand the [four Cs of diamonds](https://www.theknot.com/content/engagement-ring-diamond-grading): carat, color, cut and clarity. As the four most defining features of a diamond or a gemstone, they're used to price and grade a gem. 

It's commonly believed that carat represents the size of a diamond, but its definition is a little more nuanced than that. "A carat is a unit of weight," says jeweler [Kendra Pariseault](https://www.kendrapariseaultjewelry.com/). "It's measured by placing the diamond on a scale." One carat weighs about .20 grams—and as carat size increases, so does the rarity and price.

Visually, carat size will not always appear the same for all diamonds, even if they're graded with the same number. "Different [diamond shapes](https://www.theknot.com/content/brilliant-tips-how-to-choose-a-diamond-shape) carry their weight differently," says Kegan Fisher, founder of [Frank Darling](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=9ibcrDa*U1o&mid=48142&u1=TK-diamond-carat-size-photos&murl=https%3A%2F%2Ffrankdarling.com). "It comes down to a few key things: pavilion shape (the bottom of the diamond), overall depth, and length-to-width ratio." She relates diamond carat size to icebergs: "The more mass below the surface, the smaller it looks above. Shapes like rounds, ovals, marquises and pears tend to be shallower and spread their weight across the top, so they 'face up' larger. On the other hand, cushions, emeralds and asschers hold more of their weight down low, often with deep, bloated pavilions that make them look noticeably smaller next to something like an oval." 

## How Big is a Carat?

Mathematically speaking, how big is a carat? One carat weighs about .20 grams, and diamonds come in all carat sizes, from .25 carats to 100 or more. In fact, the largest diamond ever found, named the [Cullinan Diamond](https://www.rct.uk/collection/stories/the-crown-jewels/the-cullinan-diamond), was 3,106 carats. 

If you are curious to equate carat size to actual physical size, some [diamond size charts](https://www.brilliance.com/education/diamond-size-chart) break down the physical appearance of [solitaire diamonds](https://www.theknot.com/content/solitaire-engagement-rings). For example: a 1-carat diamond is about 6.5mm wide; a 2-carat diamond is about 8mm wide; a 3-carat diamond is about 9.1mm wide; a 4-carat diamond is about 10.25mm wide. 

So, is there such a thing as a "normal" carat size? Selecting the perfect [engagement ring for your hand](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-to-choose-an-engagement-ring-to-suit-your-hand) is a deeply personal decision, and it will vary from couple to couple. That said, we can turn to data to get a glimpse at the most common carat size right now. According to The Knot 2024 Real Weddings Study, we found that the [average engagement ring carat size](https://www.theknot.com/content/average-engagement-ring-carat-size) in the US is about 1.7 carats. 

## Diamond Carat Sizes on a Real Hand 

Curious to know what carat sizes look like on a real hand? Of course, nothing beats the experience of going into a jewelry store and trying on rings yourself. After all, we know that different diamond shapes present carat sizes differently, and the appearance will vary based on the individual. ([Your lifestyle](https://www.theknot.com/content/engagement-ring-type-based-on-lifestyle) is also a key factor to consider when selecting your center stone size.) But to help give you a sense of what carat sizes generally look like, we share seven different round diamond carat sizes on a real hand.

## How to Choose a Carat Size 

When it comes to picking the right diamond carat size for your hand, budget is typically one of the most important considerations for couples. If you're shopping within strict cost parameters, avoid going over—it's better to buy in your price range than to start off your engagement in debt. To make the most of your purchase, consider buying a carat size slightly under your preferred weight. "When shopping for diamonds, even the smallest changes in carat weight will impact the value, especially as it relates to natural diamonds," says Angie Kennedy, VP of Merchandising and Innovation at [Zales](https://www.zales.com/). "The price can increase drastically at full carat increments due to a combination of factors including rarity and market demand. Choosing a diamond just below full carat thresholds—say .90 carats instead of 1 carat—can offer savings while looking similar in size to the naked eye." 

Picking the right diamond carat size could also be determined by your choice of a [lab-grown or mined diamond](https://www.theknot.com/content/types-of-diamonds) engagement ring. "A lab-grown diamond and a natural diamond of the same carat weight will differ in price," Kennedy adds. "Lab-grown diamonds will have a significantly lower value as they are man-made in a lab over a period of days to months, and their supply is not limited. Natural diamonds are formed over billions of years in nature and once mined they cannot be replaced, making them rarer and more expensive." 

The shape of a diamond, as well as its [setting](https://www.theknot.com/content/engagement-ring-settings-101), can also impact the appearance. So, if you want the look of a larger ring without matching the budget, you may want to consider center stones that appear longer. "The shapes with the largest visual difference are non-round shapes," says Anubh Shah, founder of [With Clarity.](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=89517&awinaffid=565019&campaign=&clickref=TK-diamond-carat-size-photos&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.withclarity.com&platform=pl) "This is especially the case in elongated shapes, like radiant, marquise, oval, emerald and long cushion cuts. These shapes are trending among celebrity and influencer engagements, as well with general public perception, due to their greater visual size." 

Ultimately, when it comes to buying your engagement ring, remember that you won't regret making the most out of your purchase. "We have many clients come back to upgrade for a larger size, but never any that say they wish they'd gone smaller," says Ring Concierge founder [Nicole Wegman](https://ring-concierge.pxf.io/c/64733/863937/12049?subId1=TK-diamond-carat-size-photos&u=https%3A%2F%2Fringconcierge.com). "Don't be nervous to opt for the largest carat your budget allows. As time passes you won't regret going bigger."
