5/5 Stars on all fronts! Communication and response time, flexibility with scheduling, teacher knowledge and expertise, overall experience. Our dance instructor, Tais, choreogra...

phed our first dance for our wedding, and made this moment one of our favorite parts of our wedding day. My husband and I do not come from a dance background, but she was able to tap into our rhythm, make the dance lessons fun yet impactful, and create a dance that was fun and beautiful! We got so many compliments from our guests! Tais has advanced experience in dancing, yet still made us feel comfortable and confident practicing our dance at a beginner level. She was amazing to work with and can surely bring out the best in anyone no matter what experience level they are at. We felt extremely welcomed by the owners of the studio. They are very kind, and truly want their clients to have a positive experience. If you are thinking about dance lessons please give this studio a try and see how amazing it is for yourselves!

I was very hesitant to do a dance, but my husband really wanted us to go for it. As soon as I walked into Luna Del Soul's studio, I felt very welcomed and safe. The private practic...

e areas helped us feel more comfortable as we were learning the steps. The standout of this experience, of course, was our choreographer, Richard. He took our ideas and always made room for more. We had a crazy mashup of a string quartet song followed by a jazz rendition, so there were a lot of different steps to learn! Richard was kind, gentle, and hilarious and relatable at the same time. He was able to bring down my walls quickly, and no matter how many times I got frustrated for missing a step, he cheered us on! If you are unsure about whether or not you want to do a dance because you're anxious about failing or looking bad, don't lose hope. Sign up and call Richard. Thank me later :)

ce for our abilities and to our selected song. Neither of us had much dance background, and Tais was always patient and willing to work with us until we mastered the choreography. She herself is an incredibly talented dancer and is able to break down each move to make it easy for anyone to learn. Tais made each class fun and enjoyable, and my husband and I genuinely looked forward to each lesson. Our first dance turned out perfect and exceeded all expectations! Overall, such a great experience and would recommend Tais to any couples!

rrible, and I thought it would take us a very long time to learn our dance. Both of us found out we were wrong- we were able to finish our dance in five sessions, and honestly, we are so happy we took lessons. Because our dance looked fabulous. Everyone loved it. We are even talking about going back for some date night dance lessons in the future. Thank you, Tais! You made our dance truly special!
