Pop Fiction was absolutely incredible at our wedding! Their performance was top-notch, not only in terms of music but also in how welcoming they were. It was a highlight of our nig...

ht when they let my groomsmen join them on stage to jam, making them feel like true rockstars. Dan was a pleasure to work with—professional, responsive, and accommodating. He and the band even learned a new song for our first dance, which one of our groomsmen sang beautifully. Despite our small wedding size, Pop Fiction kept the energy high all night, ensuring our dance floor felt lively and fun. They truly went above and beyond!

Pop Fiction is the best wedding band you could ask for! They are incredibly talented, versatile, and energetic. They had our guests dancing all night long, and we received so many ...

compliments on their performance. Dan, who was the band manager and also in the band, was so great to work with! He was very responsive and experienced, and helped us figure out exactly what we needed for our big day. We wanted the 10-piece band with the horn section, and Dan knew that the stage at our venue would be too small for it, so he was able to provide a stage extension. In addition to the band itself, Dan provided a sound system for the ceremony and MC’d the entire night, including great playlists for dinner that he curated. He did a walk-through with us leading up to the wedding, in order to make sure we were fully aligned and to discuss any remaining details. Dan had great ideas not just for lighting the dancing space, but also suggested uplights for the dinner space which he provided. On the day of the wedding, Pop Fiction was everything we could have hoped for and more. They arrived on time and were very professional. They also worked well with our other wedding vendors to ensure that everything ran smoothly. The timeline for setting up was really tight, especially with the stage extension, but the band had no problem with it. Pop Fiction brought so much energy to the evening! They played a mix of classic and modern songs, and they kept the dance floor packed all night long. They were also very interactive with the crowd, and they made sure that everyone was having a good time. We would highly recommend Pop Fiction to anyone looking for a wedding band. They are truly the best in the business!

Pop fiction did an INCREDIBLE job as our wedding band. Not only are their vocalists and musicians phenomenal, but they put together an awesome set list with suggestions/input from ...

my husband and I, played several Jewish dance songs, and knew how to get folks on the floor. Dan was a great MC and wonderful and responsive point of contact for the band. Finally, definitely pay for the sax – he was arguably the star of the show and absolutely crushed it. So many folks came up to us and commented on what a great band they were and people danced through to the end of the night!

Not sure there's a better cover band in the Bay Area. Pop Fiction absolutely killed it for our wedding in July 2021. Our venue was at a winery in Sonoma and never once did I have t...

o worry about the band. Dan MC'd the whole night and also ran the music during cocktail hour and also had great sound for the ceremony with wireless mics so everyone could hear easily. The band was very interactive with the guest through the whole evening and everyone was dancing and having a great time. If you're looking for a band who plays the Horah, look no further. This was the best part of the night and Pop Fiction just kept on playing while people were dancing. We had the 7 piece version of Pop Fiction which was perfect but they go up to 9 piece with horns and I'm sure they sound even better. Guests keep raving about how great the band was and how much fun they had. Everyone knows a band is better than a DJ for a wedding and I'm very glad we had Pop Fiction there to kick ass and ensure everyone had a fantastic time.

Pop Fiction kept the dance floor going from start to finish at our wedding!! Their music and singing was phenomenal. We were so impressed with the range of songs they played for us...

, something for every guest!! Their energy and passion was so clear and felt by everyone in the room. Dan was awesome to work with throughout the process, always available and easy to coordinate with. Thank you, Pop Fiction, our wedding wouldn't have been the same without you!

Pop Fiction was AMAZING at our wedding. To this day (months after the wedding), people continue to rave about them. Dan came and met us at the venue, as they had never played there...

to make sure we had everything we needed. We unexpectedly had rain, but Pop Fiction was very accommodating and helped us pull off an outdoor ceremony (as they were providing the sound). The reception was high energy and so much fun! They made the extra effort to learn songs for our special dances, which was impressive and so thoughtful. We hated when they had to stop playing due to our venue's sound ordinance. We could have danced to them all night long!

check them out before we booked them and did a call with us before our wedding to talk through the song list. At the wedding, they were a huge hit and kept the dance floor full all night. We got so many comments from guests of all ages how much fun they had with the music and how impressed the were with the breadth of the bands repertoire. Would highly recommend!

y complaint was that we wish they had even more time to play! Dan was a great emcee and was very helpful throughout the planning process. He did a site walkthru at our venue and helped ensure the sound system was setup correctly for both our ceremony and reception. I cannot recommend Pop Fiction enough!

ll generations!!! Dan is very professional, organized, fun to work with, really knows what works, and very, very talented! Their range of songs is amazing! They cheerfully learned 2 new songs for our event - I think they were better than the originals! No one wanted the night to end because they were having so much fun dancing to Pop Fiction's music. You could not go wrong - Dan responds right away, they arrive early to set up, they interact with the audience & they are all very attractive. Just awesome!

re we had proper power and address any sound issues. They also practiced an edited version of our first dance song (that we had choreographed before hand) and performed it seamlessly. I would definitely book Pop Fiction again, and make sure they are one of your first phone calls- they book up way in advance!

An amazing band! My husband really had two requests for our wedding, for it to be scenic and to have a live band. The venue we chose had recommended Pop Fiction, but we were a li...

ttle worried about the price. We checked out a few other bands in the area, but were not quite impressed and felt like we would be settling, just because the cost would be slightly cheaper - but we would have been losing quality. Pop Fiction was so kind to let us come to a private event they played so we could hear them live. We were sold. This is a 10 piece band that just sounds so amazing and has such a quality sound with a very wide selection of songs. People who will remember our wedding, will not remember the food or decorations, they will always remember the awesome "PARTY" and band. They are worth shifting your budget to splurge on live music! I would also like to say, Dan, is so easy to work with. He truly made a stressful wedding planning super easy!

Pop Fiction played our wedding last weekend and they were incredible. At first, I thought their image was too ‘edgy’ for the classy event we were trying to throw. Boy, was I wrong....

I saw them in person and asked to sign a contract ASAP. The band are totally professional and have massive levels of energy that get the crowd into it. Best decision we made for our wedding. EVERYONE was dancing. We thought our dance floor was too small! A great problem to have! The band played a perfect combination of new, throwback 80s and 90s and classics (Twist and Shout, etc.) We only told them a few songs that we didn’t want played – they came up with the rest of the play list and it was flawless. The compliments kept coming for days. ‘Best party ever’. ‘The band was incredible’. ‘Who actually has a vocoder to sing ‘Get Lucky’?!’ Pop Fiction, that’s who.

Pop Fiction did an AMAZING JOB at our wedding. My now-husband and I have been to a zillion weddings in the past couple of years and we agree that pop Fiction's performance was abs...

olutely the best we've seen (and not just because it was our wedding). The dance floor was full all night long, which is just a testament to Pop Fiction's quality. Every single person in the band is exceptionally talented -- from the dancing lead singers to the drummer cum rapper. We have no idea how they could perform a Ke$ha song and make it sound like Ke$ha and then sing a Dolly Parton song and make it sound like Dolly! Their song list is great too. The only place it was thin was first-dance songs. We ended up having some friends of ours who are musicians play our first dance song, which was awesome. Pop Fiction was very accommodating about that. Also, Dan -- who coordinates logistics for the band -- is really reliable and nice. We gave him a long list of must-plays and do-not-plays, and he was really good about honoring it.
