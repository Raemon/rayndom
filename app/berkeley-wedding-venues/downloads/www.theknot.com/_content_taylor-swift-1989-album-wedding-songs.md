## "Our Song," _Taylor Swift_

**Lyrics you'll love:** "I've heard every album, listened to the radio/Waited for something to come along/That was as good as our song" 

While "Tim McGraw" was Swift's first single, "Our Song," was the hit off of her eponymous album that kick-started her career. Play this catchy [country love song](https://www.theknot.com/content/country-wedding-songs) as you and your S.O. enter the reception to start the night off strong.

### "Mary's Song (Oh My My My)," _Taylor Swift_

**Lyrics you'll love:** "I'll be eighty-seven; you'll be eighty-nine/I'll still look at you like the stars that shine/In the sky, oh my my my"

This sweet [love song](https://www.theknot.com/content/best-love-songs) is particularly appropriate for childhood sweethearts. It follows the story of two young friends who grow up together and fall in love throughout the course of their lives. We guarantee there won't be a dry eye in the house as this song plays. 

### "I'm Only Me When I'm With You," _Taylor Swift_

**Lyrics you'll love:** "And I don't try to hide my tears/My secrets or my deepest fears/Through it all nobody gets me like you do"

Any Swiftie's wedding reception isn't complete without this throwback jam. In fact, we think it's one of the most underrated Taylor Swift love songs ever released. Plus, it showcases Swift's unique country twang that sets her early music apart from her new songs. 

### "Love Story," _Fearless (Taylor's Version)_

**Lyrics you'll love:** "Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone/I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run/You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess/It's a love story, baby, just say, 'Yes'"

No roundup of Taylor Swift's best love songs would be complete without this iconic number. This award-winning Taylor Swift song is a must-play at your wedding as we consider it one of the most romantic Taylor Swift love songs in existence. Ask your wedding DJ to play this fairytale-inspired chart-topper that will inspire all of your guests to dance and sing along with you and your S.O.

### "Fearless," _Fearless (Taylor's Version)_

**Lyrics you'll love:** "And I don't know how it gets better than this/You take my hand and drag me head first/Fearless"

If you need some confidence-boosting music for your getting-ready playlist, be sure to include this title track to set the tone for the day. 

### "You Belong With Me," _Fearless (Taylor's Version)_

**Lyrics you'll love:** "And I know your favorite songs/And you tell me 'bout your dreams/Think I know where you belong/Think I know it's with me"

While this chart-topper is about a high school romance, it's a classic Taylor Swift hit that should be included on any superfan's wedding playlist. Even if your wedding guests aren't die-hard fans, they'll be able to sing along to this well-known hit. Add it to your reception playlist to keep everyone on the dance floor. 

### "Hey Stephen," _Fearless (Taylor's Version)_

**Lyrics you'll love:** "Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you/Can't help it if there's no one else/Mmm, I can't help myself"

We can't help ourselves—this youthful ballad is a fresh addition to any wedding playlist, especially if you're looking for under-the-radar Taylor Swift love songs. 

### "Jump Then Fall," _Fearless (Taylor's Version)_

**Lyrics you'll love:** "Take a deep breath and jump then fall into me/'Cause every time you smile, I smile/And every time you shine, I'll shine for you"

You might recognize this catchy tune from the star-studded rom-com _Valentine's Day_ (where Swift appeared as Taylor Lautner's love interest). Released on the platinum edition of _Fearless_ , "Jump Then Fall" is a swoon-worthy story about—you guessed it—jumping (and falling) into true love. 

### "Today Was a Fairytale," _Fearless (Taylor's Version)_

**Lyrics you'll love** : "Сan you feel this magic in the air?/It must have been the way you kissed me/Fell in love when I saw you standin' there/It must have been the way/Today was a fairytale"

"Today Was a Fairytale" also made its debut in _Valentine's Day,_ though this swoon-worthy ballad didn't appear on an album until April 2021, when Swift released a re-recording of _Fearless_. With mature vocals and a softer pop vibe, you'd be remiss not to include this new version on your wedding playlist. Your wedding day will be a fairytale, after all. 

### "That's When (ft. Keith Urban)," _Fearless (Taylor's Version)_

**Lyrics you'll love:** "That's when, when I see your face/That's when I love you, that's when"

### Find your kind of venue

From barns to ballrooms, discover reception venues that feel like you.

Taylor Swift nearly broke the internet with her nostalgia-fueled announcement of _Fearless (Taylor's Version)_ in early 2021, especially because she revealed the new soundtrack would include six songs from "the vault." These never-before-released songs were cut from her sophomore album in 2008, but they would ultimately make their debut 13 years later. While most of the songs from the vault are emotinal breakup tunes, "That's When" tells the story of a couple coming back together—so if you're looking for a sweet country song to add to your wedding playlist, consider it this. Swift collaborated with Keith Urban on the track, who she toured with during the original _Fearless_ era as his opening act.

### "Timeless," _Speak Now (Taylor's Version)_

**Lyrics you'll love:** "The kinda love that you only find once in a lifetime/ The kind you don't put down/ And that's when I called you and it's so hard to explain/ But in those photos, I saw us instead/ And, somehow, I know that you and I would've found each other/ In another life, you still would've turned my head even if wе'd met...you still would've been mine/ We would have been timeless"

Looking for unique Taylor Swift long songs for weddings? Consider this vault track. When Taylor Swift re-released her third album, she gifted fans multiple "From the Vault" tracks that didn't make the cut when _Speak Now_ first debuted in 2010, including "Timeless." The song is said to be about Swift's grandmother Marjorie Finlay, who famously has a song named after her on _Evermore_. It is a bittersweet love song of losing a true love. In "Epiphany" on _Folklore_ , Swift reveals that her grandfather served in World War II and the love interest in "Timeless" goes away to war which ultimately tears the couple apart. Despite the happy ending that her grandparents sadly missed out on, Swift is in the process of getting her own happy ending as she continues to re-record her albums and release songs that previously were hidden away in the vault.

### "Mine," _Speak Now (Taylor's Version)_

**Lyrics you'll love:** "You said, "I remember how we felt, sitting by the water/And every time I look at you, it's like the first time"

It's hard to find a Taylor Swift love song that doesn't give you butterflies, and "Mine" is no exception. Queue this for your reception to celebrate your love story. 

### "Sparks Fly," _Speak Now (Taylor's Version)_

**Lyrics you'll love:** "Drop everything now/Meet me in the pouring rain/Kiss me on the sidewalk/Take away the pain/'Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile"

Taylor Swift was just 16 years old when she wrote "Sparks Fly." Despite her young age, the budding superstar created a memorable love song that stands the test of time. If you need a showstopping wedding entrance song, this will wow any crowd. 

### "Enchanted," _Speak Now (Taylor's Version)_

**Lyrics you'll love:** "I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone/I'll spend forever wondering if you knew/I was enchanted to meet you"

There are just so many Taylor Swift slow love songs we can't stop playing on repeat. We have a feeling you were "enchanted" to meet your S.O., so this _Speak Now (Taylor's Version)_ tune is a no-brainer for your nuptials. 

### "Starlight," _Red (Taylor's Version)_

**Lyrics you'll love:** "And I said, 'Oh my, what a marvelous tune'/It was the best night, never would forget how we moved/The whole place/Was dressed to the nines/And we were dancing, dancing/Like we're made of starlight, starlight"

"Starlight" is one of Taylor Swift's love songs that wasn't inspired by her own romances. According to the Wall Street Journal, the storyline was actually inspired by political power couple Ethel and Bobby Kennedy after Swift found a photo of the pair dancing in the 1940s. Given its context, this upbeat song is a great addition to your reception song lineup. 

### "Everything Has Changed (ft. Ed Sheeran)," _Red (Taylor's Version)_

**Lyrics you'll love:** '"Cause all I know is we said, 'Hello'/And your eyes look like comin' home/All I know is a simple name/And everything has changed"

Taylor Swift's duet with fellow Grammy-award winner Ed Sheeran is a must for your wedding playlist. In the sentimental ballad, Sheeran and Swift sing about how falling in love drastically changes your life in a split second. In other words, it's a great song to dance to with your new spouse.

### "Begin Again," _Red (Taylor's Version)_

**Lyrics you'll love:** "I've been spending the last eight months/Thinking all love ever does/Is break and burn, and end/But on a Wednesday in a cafe/I watched it begin again"

Upon first listen, this song might sound like a heartbreak ballad. But, as any Taylor Swift fan knows, this sweet tune is actually about a blossoming relationship and the purity of new love. If you're searching for alternative slow dance songs, this deep cut will give your guests all the feels. 

### "You Are in Love," _1989 (Taylor's Version)_

**Lyrics you'll love:** "You can hear it in the silence, silence, you/You can feel it on the way home, way home, you/You can see it with the lights out, lights out/You are in love, true love"

Swift's fifth studio album is responsible for some of her most iconic hits (like "Shake It Off," "Blank Space," "Welcome to New York" and "Bad Blood"). But _1989 (Taylor's Version)_ also includes some of her most underrated love songs, including "You Are in Love." Consider this dreamy ballad for an unlikely first dance song or ceremony recessional tune.

### "King of My Heart," _Reputation_

**Lyrics you'll love:** "And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for/King of my heart, body and soul"

While _Reputation_ is Taylor Swift's edgiest album, it's not without a few swoon-worthy love songs. This selection is all about budding romance, making it suitable for your nuptials.

### "New Year's Day," _Reputation_

**Lyrics you'll love:** "Don't read the last page/But I stay when you're lost and I'm scared and you're turning away  
I want your midnights/But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day"

The final song on Swift's sixth studio album is a bittersweet and nostalgic tune, so consider using it as your wedding exit song when you and your S.O. depart at the end of the night. Swift sings about a relationship through the lens of a New Year's Eve party: the celebration, the clean-up, the solitude and the opportunity for a fresh start at the beginning of the day. It's a poignant reminder that a relationship isn't just defined by its triumphant highs—it's about the small moments too, like cleaning up bottles and gathering polaroids of your favorite memories. 

### "Call It What You Want," _Reputation_

**Lyrics you'll love:** "I did one thing right/I'm laughing with my lover, making forts under covers/Trust him like a brother, yeah, you know I did one thing right/Starry eyes sparkin' up my darkest night"

As one of Swift's most honest love songs, "Call It What You Want" is a memorable collaboration with producer Jack Antonoff that deserves a spot on your reception playlist. 

### "Lover," _Lover_

**Lyrics you'll love:** "My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue/All's well that ends well to end up with you"

The title track of Swift's seventh studio album is a must-play at your wedding. Not only do the lyrics sound like wedding vows, "Lover" showcases some of Swift's most powerful songwriting to date. Use it as your first dance song or during your ceremony to set the tone of the day.

### "Paper Rings," _Lover_

**Lyrics you'll love:** "I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings/Uh huh, that's right/Darling, you're the one I want, and/I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this"

Fast-paced Taylor Swift love songs are hard to come by, so "Paper Rings" is a hidden gem. If you, too, would marry your S.O. with paper rings, make sure this gets a spot on your wedding soundtrack. 

### "invisible string," _Folklore_

**Lyrics you'll love:** "And isn't it just so pretty to think/All along there was some/Invisible string/Tying you to me?"

While Swift's surprise eighth album has a somber vibe compared to her earlier work, "invisible string" deserves to be on your wedding playlist. In the quirky track, Swift appears to sing about the "red thread of fate," an East Asian mythological teaching that says an invisible thread is tied to the fingers of soulmates. The two are connected by destiny and, as the myth says, will find each other one day by fate. If you're looking for a romantic Taylor Swift song for your wedding, consider it this. 

### "gold rush," _Evermore_

**Lyrics you'll love:** "I don't like anticipating my face in a red flush/I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch/Everybody wants you/Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you" 

Just five months after the release of _Folklore_ , Swift surprised fans once again with the unexpected drop of _Evermore_. Like its preceding sister album, _Evermore_ is a moody, cottagecore-inspired soundtrack of fables and historical stories. As one of the album's only love songs, "gold rush" details the exhilarating feeling of love at first sight—a fitting tune for your wedding reception.

_@TaylorSwift/Instagram_

### "Sweet Nothings," _Midnights_

**Lyrics you'll love** : "I found myself a-running home to your sweet nothings/Outside they're push and shoving/You're in the kitchen hummin'/All that you ever wanted from me was nothing" 

Looking for a romantic song to walk down the aisle to? We love the idea of setting your ceremony processional to "Sweet Nothings," from Swift's tenth studio album. Another idea? Use an instrumental version for a magical moment. 

### "Paris," _Midnights (3am Edition)_

**Lyrics you'll love** : "I'm so in love that I might stop breathing/Drew a map on your bedroom ceiling/No, I didn't see the news/'Cause we were somewhere else"

In true Taylor Swift fashion, the release of _Midnights_ wasn't without a "special very chaotic surprise"—and it just so happened to be a drop of seven bonus tracks (at 3:00 a.m., that is), just three hours after the album was shared. Included in this selection of extra tunes is "Paris," an upbeat song about falling in love that you _definitely_ need on your wedding reception playlist... even if you aren't swapping vows in the City of Love. 

### "The Alchemy," _The Tortured Poets Department_

**Lyrics you'll love: "** So when I touch down/Call the amateurs and/Cut 'em from the team/Ditch the clowns, get the crown/Baby I'm the one to beat/Cause the sign on your heart/Said it's still reserved for me/Honestly, who are we to fight the alchemy?"

The eagerly anticipated 11th installment in Swift's lineup of hit studio albums is—as expected—filled with a spectrum of emotion and deep-cutting lyrics. While _The Tortured Poets Department_ isn't exactly a love story, there is one especially romantic track on there to consider. "The Alchemy" is about a couple with meant-to-be chemistry and has a beat that's fitting for a slow dance. If you're looking for an alternative first dance track, this could be it. 

### "So High School," _The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology_

**Lyrics you'll love:** "And in the blink of a crinklin' eye/I'm sinkin', our fingers entwined/Cheeks pink in the twinklin' light/Tell me 'bout the first time you saw me"

_The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology_ is the double album version of Swift's latest release, which, to the surprise and delight of fans, dropped just two hours after the original. The tracklist includes a song that's especially fitting for high school sweethearts. "So High School" depicts a playful and passionate love that's reminiscent of high school romance (and inspired by the star's relationship with Travis Kelce, rumor has it). It's a sweet addition to any Swiftie's wedding reception playlist.

### "Honey," _The Life of a Showgirl_

**Lyrics you'll love:** "You can call me 'honey' if you want because I'm the one you want...But you touched my face/ Redefined all of those blues when you say 'honey'...Honey, I'm home, we could play house/ We can bed down, pick me up/ Who's the baddest in the land? What's the plan? (What's the plan?)/ You could be my forever-night stand, honey."

"Honey" is an invitation to be called by the titular petname. In the song Swift sings about resenting the name in previous interactions, but welcomes her love interest to use it in her new relationship. 

### "The Fate of Ophelia," _The Life of a Showgirl_

**Lyrics you'll love:** "You dug me out of my grave and/ Saved my heart from the fate of Ophelia (Ophеlia)/ Keep it one hundred on the land (Land), thе sea (Sea), the sky/ Pledge allegiance to your hands, your team, your vibes/ Don't care where the hell you've been (Been) 'cause now (Now), you're mine/ It's 'bout to be the sleepless night you've been dreaming of/ The fate of Ophelia"

This Taylor Swift love song on TLOASG is about the character Ophelia in William Shakespeare's drama Hamlet who famously dies by drowning. The catchy bop talks about being saved from that same fate by a lover. In an October 2025 interview with iHeart Radio, Taylor Swift said, "Someone comes into your life and rescues you from the fate of being driven mad by love." 

### "Opalite," _The Life of a Showgirl_

**Lyrics you'll love:** "And that's when I told you, 'It's alright/ You were dancing through the lightning strikes/ Sleepless in the onyx night/ But now, the sky is opalite, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh/ Oh, my Lord/ Never made no one like you before/ You had to make your own sunshine. But now, the sky is opalite, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh"

In a radio interview following the release of Taylor Swift's 12th studio album she talked about how fiancé Travis Kelce (whose birthstone is opal) inspired this song. In an interview with Capitol FM in October 2025 she said, "Travis' birthstone is an opal, so I've always fixated on that, I've always loved that stone. I thought it was kind of cool metaphor. [Opalite is] a man-made opal, and happiness can also be man-made, too. So, that's kind of what the song is about, kind of the juxtaposition of those two."

### "Wood," _The Life of a Showgirl_

**Lyrics you'll love:** "And, baby, I'll admit I've been a little superstitious, fingers crossed until you put your hand on mine...Seems to be that you and me, we make our own luck, I don't need to catch the bouquet, to know a hard rock is on the way.

This song will raise a few eyebrows with your MIL and grandparents, so it's best kept to your [Taylor Swift bachelorette party](https://www.theknot.com/content/taylor-swift-bachelorette).
