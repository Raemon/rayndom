I cannot say enough wonderful things about my experience at Starlet Bridal. From the moment we walked in, my mom and I felt welcomed, supported, and genuinely cared for. The salon ...

is beautiful, and the selection of dresses was absolutely stunning. The atmosphere was elegant yet relaxed, exactly what I hoped for when searching for my dress. A very special shoutout to Molly, who truly made my experience as positive as it was. Molly was an absolute gem - patient, knowledgeable, and so intuitive. She listened closely to what I was envisioning and guided me with such grace and enthusiasm. Molly pulled a dress I never would have thought to try - and it ended up being the one! Her eye for detail and her ability to make me feel confident and beautiful made the entire process unforgettable. I truly felt like she was just as excited about my wedding as I was! Thanks to Molly and the amazing team at Starlet Bridal, I found the dress of my dreams and had the most incredible experience doing it. I would recommend this salon to any bride-to-be without hesitation!

Starlet was very helpful during not only my fitting but also the ordering process and alterations. Post COVID the delivery time was long and I was freaking out slightly, but the st...

aff at Starlet assured me every time I called that it would arrive on time. I also ordered extra lace from them to had straps to my dress and they worked with my alterations gal to get those to her without my help. I did use the alterations person that they recommended, Lina, and I could not be more happy with her. She was a miracle worker! But I loved that her and Starlet were in contact with each other and were able to deliver the dresses and my extra pieces together without me having to be the runner between the two. I would definitely recommend them to any bride!

5 star service! I said YES to the dress thanks to the ladies at Starlet! I had some ideas of what I was looking for and they headed to the racks to find dresses that either matched...

what I had in mind, or what they thought would look good on my figure. I tried on less than 10 dresses before finding MY dress! I was expecting this to be a stressful process and didn't expect to fall in love with a dress so quickly! It was also helpful to have their insights on what could be changed during alterations - my dress was perfect on my wedding day! Thank you Starlet!

I wrote out this review many times, but it boils down to the shop selling me a dress as "new" when it was clearly used. They charged me full price and failed to deliver the product...

I ordered. After having a bad experience with the shop I decided to pick it up and take it elsewhere for alterations. Wanting to get the heck out of the shop I didn't give it a deep look until going over the dress with a trusted alterations woman. Before leaving it for alterations I had to sign for the following defects. \- Discoloration in the armpits \- Frays and runs in the belt \- Discoloration at the bottom of the dress \- 3 missing buttons \- Damaged lace \- Fuzzballs all over the dress as it was worn This shop stated they ordered me a new dress, had me wait for months, and gave me a used dress. I warn any bride from ordering their dress here! Never prepay, don't let the staff shake you, and don't leave the shop without a super deep inspection. Buyer Beware!

This last weekend, my daughter, myself and friends and family went to Starlet to look for a wedding dress. We DID NOT expect to find it on our first day looking. We had 3 weekend...

s of appointments made and were ready for the long search for THE dress. Much to our surprise, dress #4 would be the one she would say yes to. Starlet was amazing! Everyone was so kind to our family and took amazing care of us... complete with champagne and cookies. Our personal stylist made my daughter feel like a princess! There was laughter, tears and the day was everything I have ever dreamed it would be helping my daughter find her gown. She glowed as she stood and looked at herself in the mirror and I was so happy for this moment she was experiencing. They were wonderful at finding dresses that fit her taste and budget. I really can't say enough about how great our experience was. My daughter grew up in Sonoma County however we no longer live in the area... finding a dress at Starlet was like having a little piece of home for her wedding. If you are looking for a dress in Sonoma County, this is a wonderful place to look.

The Starlet Bridal team goes above and beyond to help a bride! I bought a dress that I thought I loved from David's Bridal, only to discover a month before my wedding, that I actua...

lly didn't love it as much as I thought I did. I have scars up and down my back and the first dress didn't cover them enough for me to feel comfortable. My fiance (at the time, now husband) called Starlet and described that his future wife was feeling self-conscious in her dress and that we needed a new dress to cover her back and we're getting married in a month and can they help. Starlet said, yes, of course, send her in. So I went in. They pulled 3 dresses for me right away, and each dress was gorgeous. The 2nd dress ended up fitting perfectly. The set me up for alterations with Lina, who is a complete gem and very talented with wedding dress alterations, and I had my dress ready to go before my big day. The dress was gorgeous, the day was perfect, and I can thank the team at Starlet Bridal for helping me get there. I highly recommend checking out their store!! Thank you Starlet!!

I'm 3 for 3 at this salon. I bought my 2 prom dresses in high school here and always loved the selection. My mom and I decided to pop into here one day on a whim after I got engage...

d just to try on some silhouettes. The women here were just lovely. Very respectful of the fact that I wasn't ready to commit, but still incredibly helpful, knowledgeable, and listened extremely well. We ended up finding "the dress" and couldn't not come back for it. They were more than willing to play along like I hadn't found my gown so my aunts who accompanied me the second time could partake in the process. Great selection, great price point, and very nice sales people. So glad to give them so much of my business!!!!!

find it. Starlet was the closest to where I live that carried the designer Sophia Tolli and so I decided to give them a call. Since the phone call I've fallen in love with this store Irene is just so great! I needed up going into the store for measurements and again I'm impressed with how great the staff is. I would recommend this salon to everyone. 😊💕

ss shops, and none came close to comparing to Starlet, in terms of dress selection, atmosphere, and the helpfulness of the staff. Allison, the owner of Starlet, is absolutely wonderful. She answered SO MANY of our questions, not just about dresses, but the entire wedding planning process. I highly, highly recommend Starlet to anyone. I should also add that I have some pretty significant anxiety, and it took me a long time, and many, many, many visits (10+ at least) for me to work through my anxiety and commit to a dress. I cannot thank Allison enough for her help. Allison and the entire staff, were all so amazingly helpful and supportive throughout the entire process. Everyone gave me the time I needed to feel comfortable with every step of the process. THANK YOU Allison.

EDITED AFTER CALLING THE SALON: I first called Starlet it was because they were the only salon in my area that carried the designer I wanted to try. They didn't have a sample of th...

e gown I wanted, but they went above and beyond to order it in for me from the designer. When I got there, I KNEW it was the one. Alison, the owner, made sure to show me a few different veils and accessories and the whole process was great. When I went to pick up my dress my experience was a little less than wonderful. I gained a little bit of weight from my initial appointment so the dress didn't zip all the way. I cannot imagine this is an issue they have never dealt with before, but both consultants seemed overly irritated when I asked them a few times to try to zip it up. Maybe I should have just laughed it off and said "oh well, my $4000 designer dream dress doesn't fit, no big deal!" But I wanted them to try a couple of times to get it to stay up long enough for me to show my aunts, since we'd driven three hours so they could see me in my dress. Without a word to me, both consultants left my fitting room to help another customer. I waited a few minutes, and it became obvious they weren't coming back in. Since my dress was only halfway zipped I motioned for my aunts to come in and help me. They were able to get the top button done up so the dress would stay, and I had them pin the bow/embellishment on the back so I could get the full effect. I went out, twirled around in the dress, tried on a couple of hair accessories, and took some pictures. I wanted to try on an elbow-length veil that the owner had insisted I try on at my initial appointment, because I had fallen in love with the look of the veil, but they both insisted that they'd never seen the veil. One of them finally said that maybe they had it, but someone probably bought it off the rack. Both consultants were hovering, and I realized the store was empty, so I got worried it was past closing time and we were keeping them there (it wasn't even 4pm) so I asked for a picture of my family together and then asked one of the consultants to help me out of my dress. I was a little irritated, but still really grateful to them (they'd helped me get my dream dress, and it was not a big deal to have my aunts help me into the gown) so at this point I'm trying to be polite and friendly and the consultant was having NONE of it. I basically wanted out of there. Now, every person I had spoken to on the phone at the salon knew I was getting married overseas, and would be travelling with my gown. When I ordered the dress, AND when I called to make an appointment to try on my gown when it arrived, I was told that they would "get [me] a NICE GARMENT BAG" for my gown. When I walked out of the store with my $4000 dress in a plastic bag thinner than the ones you'd get at a department store, I was beyond upset. Even David's Bridal gave my SIL a garment bag for her gown. My dress is in a plastic bag that ripped open when it snagged on the cheap plastic hanger and is crunched up at the bottom because the bag is too small for a dress that poofy. EDIT: I called the salon today and spoke with Kim, who apologized profusely and offered to mail me a garment bag and hanger (which she said they generally give to their brides) and Allie called me and apologized again. When I gave them the opportunity, they didn't even hesitate to correct the situation and went above and beyond to make things right for me. Thank you so much!!!

Due to a series of unfortunate events at another bridal salon, the first bridal gown I purchased did not fit. It was not only 6 inches too long, but it did not fit the way the att...

endant had fitted me in the sample dress. Due to the construction of the dress, numerous seamstresses refused to work on the dress due to the sheer amount of work it would take to shorten the hem. The dress was a solid panel of lace and would have to be completely reconstructed. The one seamstress who was willing to do it, quoted me a price of $1000+. As the dress was ~$1960 to begin with, I felt it would exceed the value of the dress to proceed with the alterations. However, I only became aware of the ill-fit of the dress 2 and a half months before my wedding. Both my parents and I were emotionally exhausted from trying to figure out ways to fix or wear accessories (undergarments, increasing heel height from 2” to 5”) to ultimately enable me to wear the dress. Nothing worked. One evening, I happened to be checking my email, and came across an advertisement for a sample dress sale at Starlet Bridal and Prom. As I purchased both my prom gowns through Starlet, I took a look through their sample dress selection. One dress they were advertising was absolutely stunning, half price, but a size 18. I emailed immediately nonetheless. I received a response first thing the next morning. They were able to fit me immediately to try on the dress. From the moment I arrived, the atmosphere was comforting, warm, with no sales pressure. This was completely opposite to the first bridal salon my mom and I had visited to purchase the original dress. Alison was so very welcoming, we felt compelled to tell her our story. She completely understood what we were going through and even walked us through how to inspect the seams of a dress to determine how it could be altered. She showed us how the size 18 could be brought down to my size (a size 6) with minimal cost. Despite showing the positives of the dress and helping us in our decision, we never felt pressure to purchase the gown or anything of the like. In fact, she even commented that she would understand if we didn’t purchase it. After she gave us time to talk amongst ourselves, we decided to purchase the gown. Alison was able to immediately set up a fitting appointment with her in-house seamstress, Azi. Azi was a dream to work with. It took 5 fittings, but Azi was able to reconstruct the dress, add a 7 point bustle, and shorten the hem. Considering the dress was actually two parts (a sheer lace cover and a plain satin sheath), this was quite an accomplishment. The dress was even finished 3 weeks before the wedding! Every time I went in for a fitting, which was held at the Starlet salon, Alison always made sure to check in with us to see the progress of the fittings. Her staff were beyond excellent and great to work with. The dress turned out gorgeous! And, after donating the original dress to charity, I not only recouped the cost of the dress, but saved money! Alison really saved the day!

The wedding dress is a hard thing to find, when you go to the chains like david's bridal, the quality is poor, and even if you are surrounded by 300 gowns you won't find the one, a...

nd often in the boutique, they try to have you spend more than you want to. At starlet, even if I was helped by a different salesperson every time I went, the service was always top quality. I found my dress there, listening to what I was searching for they even went in the back of the store, to get what would be the dress ! They have choice, they try to catch the dress you have in mind and to give it to you ! They also have a nice selection of bags, sashes, brooches, shoes, garter, veils... Really nice store where you might also find you rehearsal dinner dress !

rong and ended up being so impressed with Starlet! They had such a large variety of dresses in a wide range of prices ($500-6,000). I found the dress of my dreams, which was in my budget at Starlet and had such a positive experience. The staff was great, so helpful but I never felt any pressure to buy. We enjoyed shopping there so much, that we went back for the mother of the bride dress and my shoes! I would highly recommend Starlet!!!

I went here because the store is known for its selection of interesting and more unique dresses and they had a specific designer I was interested in. Like any shop in the wine cou...

ntry, they’re more pricey than traveling out of the area to dress shop. My first visit was great, I tried on several dresses, discussed what I liked and didn’t and then the clerk helping me said she had a discontinued stock dress that sounded like what I was interested in and in my size, and it ended up being the PERFECT dress! I was so grateful for her going the extra mile to find the dress from the back. After that though, it was a lot of confusion and rushed service. When I went it for the fitting with their alteration person, she was rushed and had appointments back to back so was hurrying to get through and wouldn’t listen to some of the ideas I had. When I went back for the “final” fitting, again rushed, part of the bustle was not all the way up. I mentioned it several times and she said it was fine and how it was supposed to be but one side was clearly lower. Finally another person commented and she admitted she had missed a button and would fix it but said I didn’t need another fitting. I also bought a veil here that I realized once I got it home to try it on again, was torn on the hair comb and missing some beads. I took it back and the owner said she would fix it and have it back in a week. I never heard from her and starting calling to check in and it was a month and a half before she had it back for me to pick up. Some beads she couldn’t find so realigned them, and didn’t offer any discount since I had already paid for it… We also bought the bridesmaids dresses here, the ordering went fine, but when they went to try them on one girl left hers to have it steamed and the rest took theirs home. When she called a week before the wedding to arrange to pick it up, they said they didn’t have the dress. This of course caused panic for day and a half until they called back and said they had found it in the back… This also happened with my dress when I was arranging to pick it up, the shop said the alterations person still had it, who said they had already turned it back to the shop… Knowing they had a history of mix ups, I didn’t panic, and the called back by the end of the day to say they found it… The confusion and extra effort it took to get things done was disheartening with so much else going on.

I ended up getting a second reception dress. They were helpful, friendly, and super accomodating with trying to plan fittings around my insane schedule. We also got the tuxes here.

much more rushed at this appt. I ended up purchasing my dress there because it was closer to home. They have a seamstress there but she does not work for the salon &amp; you have to pay her seperate which I thought was out of the ordinary. The shop has to salon's one of bridal gowns &amp; the other of prom dresses &amp; bridesmaids dresses. All of the alterations are done at the bridal side &amp; when I went in for my fitting it was prom season! I had an appt &amp; I still had to wait to put my dress on &amp; then I had to wait for the seamstress to come over &amp; help me. I went here to save a couple bucks &amp; a little travel time but I should have gone with my gut &amp; gone to the larger salon. Overall I would still recomend them because it is a small hometown shop &amp; they definitley know thier gowns!
