Aurelio Delgado

Owner

I started this company because music has always been my passion. I knew I wanted to be a DJ when I first saw my cousin play at a house party. The way that a DJ can control a crowd with music alone is amazing. A DJ can make or break your party!

Aurelio is hands down the best! We certainly bonded over some old school classic hip hop and some good soul/R&B. It was really fun to talk to him, it was like we were good friends...

just enjoying conversation about all sorts of music and that made phone conversations and emails very pleasant. As we got closer to the big day, we had a few more phone conversations and even met with him in person a few days before, telling him specific songs we'd like to play, any songs we don't want played, etc. We felt we were able to communicate easily with Aurelio, he listened and really took note on our ideas. Our wedding day was amazing thanks to Aurelio! A friend told me that the two most important components for a memorable wedding is good food and good music, and it is so true! All our guests were on the dance floor the entire night! Aurelio executed all the songs we asked to play, mixed in songs he knew the crowd would vibe with everyone LOVED the music selections and we received so many compliments from our guest’s post-wedding. It was truly a memorable night thanks to Aurelio. He really killed it!!! Look no further if you want a super friendly, down to earth, professional, eclectic music DJ/Emcee. Aurelio is the best choice. Your search is over, and you'll be so happy that you went with him!

makes sure he knows what YOU want. He understands the stress that comes with a wedding and genuinely wants you to feel relaxed and reminds you to let him take at least one stress off your shoulders. And I’ll tell you, the music for the whole event was the last of my worries because I was so confident in him. We had 3 different areas for music and he had no issue setting all that up. From the ceremony, to dinner to the reception, he was amazing. He knows how to read a crowd and make everyone have a good time. I don’t think there was a time when the dance floor wasn’t full of people! HIGHLY recommend!
