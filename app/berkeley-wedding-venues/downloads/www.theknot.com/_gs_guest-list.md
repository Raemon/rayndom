## See why couples love our guest list manager

âI loved creating our wedding website and being able to add our guest list for RSVPs. I found my venue through the suggestions on the site as well as created my colors/styles through the quiz and inspiration board. Overall it has been a very helpful tool!â

Erica & Wesley

Colfax, ND

âI am living by this app! It was extremely helpful with finding and contacting vendors. Its timeline is thorough and you can add/delete/customize your to-dos (and their dates). The guest list and tracking has also taken a lot of work out of tracking RSVPs and the reminders for RSVPs are very helpful.â

Maura & Wiktor

âIf youâre not using The Knotâs guest list for weddings, you need to start stat. I was able to track addresses, meal choices and what gifts were coming my way all at once.â

### What can The Knot Guest List help me do?

Our free guest list tool lets you easily manage your wedding guest list, collect addresses and track RSVPs in one convenient spot. Whether youâre sending paper or digital invitations (or both!), your guest list automatically syncs with your website and guest messages for efficient, private RSVPs and communication throughout planning.

### How do I add my guest list to The Knot?

[Copy our wedding guest list spreadsheet template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zVOCEQgIzCxGfu4p7iPHd4ZPaLjhwc_UNMtZiQ2Ch3g/copy) to quickly add multiple guests to your guest list on The Knot. You can also add guests individually by typing their info directly in the tool, or send guests a link to a private form. In the [mobile app](/wedding-planning-app), you can quickly add guests from your phoneâs contacts.

### Is the guest list manager only for weddings?

Whether youâre having a wedding shower, bach party, engagement party or rehearsal dinner, our guest list manager was thoughtfully designed to help you gather guest info and keep it organized for any and all of your events.

### How is guest information in The Knot Guest List used?

The Knot Guest List allows you to manage your guest information in real time (and other information your guests may share) and communicate with them. When you upload your guest list youâre agreeing that you have informed or you will inform your guests and youâre authorized to share their information with us and our service providers. Weâre not responsible for your guest list nor the actions that you perform using our platform. Your guestsâ information is safe and never shared with anyone for any purpose.

### If we use RSVP cards, can the guest list manager help us track responses?

Sure! Even without a website, you can input your guestsâ responses to The Knot Guest List yourself. Enjoy efficient and organized RSVP tracking, complete with graphs and easy-to-share exportable listsâwhether you have paper wedding invitations with RSVP cards, a wedding website or both.
