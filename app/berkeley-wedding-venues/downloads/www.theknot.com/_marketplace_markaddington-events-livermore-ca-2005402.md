Mark Addington

Owner

Born in California, but raised all across the U.S. I wanted a life of adventure and believe me, it’s been anything but ordinary. I’ve worked at a Casting Agency and on movie sets, DJ’d on the SF club scene, acted and modeled, rocked thousands of events and even managed a Blockbuster Video at one point in my life! With over 20 years of professional DJ/Emcee/Public Speaking experience, I fell in love with love with helping bring energy and memories to any type of life event you can think of. Enough about me, let's make this about you!

Mark is incredible! He was recommended by our wedding venue and had DJed our friend's wedding a few years back. As part of the process, Mark shares an online planner that makes i...

t simple to request specific "must-play" songs as well as any songs that you do not want played during the event. During our live call, Mark made several suggestions about various aspects of the wedding that we hadn't even thought of, for instance, the song we wanted our wedding party to walk down the aisle to, the song that would play after our ceremony finished, the cocktail hour music vs. dinner music, and more. Mark was energetic, communicative & responsive, and he was flexible to a few last-minute changes the day of the wedding. He was truly able to read the room/crowd. All of our friends & family raved about Mark's emceeing as well as the music that he played. Finally, his pricing was also very reasonable and included uplighting! We would highly recommend Mark for your next event!

My husband and I had the great pleasure of working with Mark for our wedding, and we have nothing but the highest recommendation and accolades to give to him. From start to finis...

h, communicating with Mark was a treat. His energy and excitement for his work is infectious - talking with him and walking through the emotions we wanted to elicit throughout the day was actually what pulled us out of the grind of planning the wedding and made us start feeling excited for the day to arrive. Even as early as our first meeting, we could tell that Mark had a good feel for the energy and vibe we were aiming for, and we knew we were in good hands, with Mark even having (solicited!) input on how to use each of the genres of music we liked at different points during the event to manage energy levels, a credit to his experience and care for what he does. As the day approached, Mark remained easy and flexible to work with, allowing us to make numerous changes to various song choices and lengths for our dances even just days before the event. After providing a few songs to serve as the guidelines for what we wanted to have played for open dancing, Mark had our full trust to flesh out the rest of the night, and when we requested to play a song that my husband had recorded, Mark went as far as to pay him for the song, out of respect for the art. That's like the equivalent of over 1000 streams on Spotify, just saying, and made our day! On the wedding day, meeting Mark at the venue was like meeting an old friend - he was just as excited for us as any of our guests were. Due to Mark's level of preparation and communication ahead of time, we didn't need to discuss any further details or set up with him, and he completely nailed the brief. From the various songs played during the ceremony, to microphones, to emceeing the dinner and speeches, to the first and parental dances, to bringing the house down at the end of the night, everything went off without a hitch, and he also brought us cookies from his wife (incredible!!)?? The flow of the day was perfect, and the music created a new atmosphere for each segment of the day that matched the vibe perfectly. We will be recommending Mark to any future wedding couples in our lives for hopes of getting to see him work his magic again, and if you're looking for someone to bring excitement and care to your event along with the foresight that comes with experience in the business, Mark is your guy. Thanks for an amazing day, Mark! <3

So many guests let us know it was the most fun they've had at a wedding in a very long time as well, thanks to how good the music was. If I could give mark a million stars in this review, I would!

Thanks Mark for the best wedding ever!!!

We booked Mark for our March 2024 wedding and we could not have picked a better DJ! Music and dancing was a huge part of our wedding and we knew we wanted a DJ that could get our g...

uests on the dance floor and we think he had a hard time catching a break since no one wanted to stop dancing! He was very professional and super fun and understood exactly what we were looking for in all of our "magic moments" as well as the open dancing. Along with using our special ceremony songs exactly how we wanted, we gave him some playlist ideas for the pre-ceremony, cocktail hour, and dancing times but he knew exactly how to curate the rest of the songs to fit our crowd perfectly (all ages were dancing and enjoying the night). We would recommend Mark to anyone and we're looking forward to having a future event when we can book him again!

Need a DJ? Book Mark Addington!! We met Mark through close friends who booked him for their wedding. We reached out and were immediately impressed with his energy, knowledge, profe...

ssionalism, and attentiveness. We were blessed to see Mark in action at our friends' wedding several months later. Mark was brilliant from start to finish!! Mark was helpful and amazing throughout our process. On our big day, Mark brought his "A" game. He checked in with the officiant and wedding party before the ceremony and assisted our coordinator throughout the night. We trusted Mark with the dance music, and Mark did not disappoint. Mark made our "photo dash" experience memorable and kept people on our dance floor the entire night. Mark, thank you again; you are indeed a master of your craft.

el at ease right away. One of the standout aspects of working with Mark was his enthusiasm for our wedding concept. We wanted to include both dancing and board games during the reception, and he embraced the uniqueness and really made things come to life. We’ll remember the liveliness that Mark created for a long, long time. Mark already had familiarity with our venue, so he handled all the setup himself, ensuring everything was perfectly arranged without us having to worry about a thing. We requested light emceeing, and Mark respected our wishes perfectly. Despite this, he made sure to get the pronunciation of our names just right, showing great attention to detail. Our names were pronounced flawlessly, which meant a lot to us. Overall, Mark provided an exceptional DJ service that was tailored to our specific needs and preferences. We highly recommend Mark to anyone looking for a dedicated, professional, and amicable DJ. Thank you, Mark, for making our wedding day unforgettable!

intrest inspo come true. We just told him what vibes we wanted for the ceremony, cocktail hour and reception and he delivered! He was keeping the party alive throughout the night with the inpromptu song requests from friends while maintaining the atmosphere of the wedding we wanted. He was just as excited as we were for our big day as both of us are huge disney fans. I felt like he understood us as a couple and gave us really great suggestions. He was great at MCing as well and made the night flow seamlessly. My wedding party has names that are difficult to pronounce and he perfected each one of them. Mark is awesome, professional and provided amazing services throughout the whole day. All my guests said they had a wonderful time. Would highly recommend him to anybody who is looking for someone to make their wedding planning and day less stressful.

cess leading to our event. During our preparation, we communicated with Mark a few times over email, phone and zoom to share our ideas and refine details. He is extremely positive and was open to our suggestions. Whether it was playing music related to movie soundtracks, pop culture, or K-pop, he was more than willing to have fun with us. His attention to detail also did not go unnoticed as he would also make sure that he finds the specific versions of songs that you request. He was also extremely helpful with adjusting music as well. For example, we wanted to cut a section out and slow down our first dance song. He was able to do this for us perfectly and also helped provide a copy of the file for us to practice. These may be small details but were important to us. Ultimately, you cannot go wrong with working with Mark. He was absolutely amazing at what he does and will do everything that he can to make your dream event come true! Thank you, Mark. We are so happy to have worked with you.

taphorical plate, and this guy is for sure hitting home runs! Sports terminology aside my wife and I adore this man. We had the pleasure of meeting him at a few of the numerous weddings we have been to and immediately locked him in the moment I proposed to my then-girlfriend. From start to finish, Mark is organized, personable, and professional while keeping the vibe comfortable. His ability to read the room is unparalleled with other DJs I have experienced over the years. Hiring Mark isn't just hiring another DJ or MC. It's like hiring another personal wedding coordinator for your big day. Words cannot express how grateful I am for finding Mark and making our big day even more special. This man deserves every positive accolade that can be placed on an individual. If you're looking for a DJ with infectious positivity it is this man. With no hesitation, we have already suggested Mark to other friends at their weddings and upcoming events. Thank you, Mark, Lana and I hope to see you soon!

tention to detail was impeccable. I also want to highlight how great his communication was. When planning a wedding, it's really stressful when you work with vendors who don't respond right away and Mark never dropped the ball. He commented on how flexible he was as far as being involved as little or as much as we wanted when it came to the music and being MC for our event. And this is something I really appreciated as I was overseeing so many details that I was feeling overwhelmed at having to choose all the music and manage the pacing of the wedding but he really jumped in enthusiastically, ready to tackle whatever we needed. During our 2nd call in particular, he was so well organized and asked many questions that my husband and I hadn't even thought of so that really helped build our trust that he would handle everything day of without any issue. A lot of my guests were impressed that the MC at our wedding was also the DJ because of how well he multi-tasked. Music was very important to me, particularly the dance playlist and in our first call, Mark had said that his goal at the end of the night, was to have our guests saying it was the best wedding they had ever been to and that they didn't want the party to end. Well, I can confidently say that he nailed it! Cannot say enough about how happy we were with Mark and would highly recommend him to anyone looking for an amazing DJ/MC!

did he allow for us to contact him at anytime, but he took the time to set up a call a few days before to make sure he had everything he needed for the day to run smoothly. Moving to our wedding day, he absolutely made our music dreams come true! He was so organized, staying on schedule, from songs walking down the aisle, bridal party & couple introductions, toasts, first dances, and our amazing night of dancing for the rest of the wedding day! He was also super considerate and made sure to check in at all times to make sure my husband and I were comfortable with every decision he made. I will continually recommend him to anyone getting married because he was an essential part of making our dream wedding come true!

edding day one in a million. Throughout the entire planning process, working with Mark was an absolute delight. His seamless and effortless approach to coordinating the music for our big day was nothing short of amazing. His online portal, complete with a user-friendly template for selecting songs for different moments during the wedding, made the entire process so simple and stress-free. We were able to curate our ideal playlist with ease, and Mark was always there to offer guidance and suggestions when needed. One of the most memorable moments that truly highlighted Mark's professionalism and dedication was the morning of our wedding. A massive storm had swept through the Bay Area, causing a power outage across the entire regional park where our wedding was set to take place. Mark didn't hesitate for a moment. Without us even reaching out, he was already working closely with our other vendors to ensure everything would run smoothly. His proactive approach and quick communication put our minds at ease and allowed us to focus on other aspects of the wedding. Mark brought his unique blend of professionalism and a fun-loving spirit that was a breath of fresh air. He exuded a positive and infectious energy that added to the magical atmosphere of the day. Mark's ability to read the room and gauge the mood of our guests was masterful. Once dinner was over and the party got started, he had everyone up and dancing well into the night. The energy on the dance floor was electric, and Mark played a pivotal role in creating an unforgettable celebration. In summary, Mark is not just a wedding DJ; he's a true wedding professional who goes above and beyond to make your day extraordinary. His impeccable planning, adaptability, and undeniable talent for keeping the party going are qualities that set him apart. If you're looking for someone to make your wedding day special and stress-free, look no further than Mark. We are forever grateful for his contribution to our wedding day and can't recommend him highly enough. Thank you, Mark, for helping us create lasting memories that we will cherish forever.

Mark was amazing to work with and made our Aug. 19 wedding so incredibly special. From our initial conversation I knew he would be a good fit . We were a bit insane and gave him a ...

playlist of about 6 hours of music, ranging from oldies to Reggaeton, to dance music, to classic rock to work with. Mark understood our vision perfectly and somehow made it all fit seamlessly together. Our goal was to spend as much time on the dance floor as possible, and I was excited to see people that normally don’t dance out there. Each time we spoke with Mark leading up to the wedding, we felt so secure in our choice. There’s sooo much more to what a DJ does than just play your music. They set the vibe and quite literally move the event along. Considering how much goes into pulling off a wedding, our vendors made it unbelievably easy for us to sit back and enjoy our night — Mark was a major part of that, and we can’t recommend him enough.
