Michael Luna came with our venue as our DJ. He was great! Responsive, and great at what he did. The whole reception was dancing the whole night!

We hired Michael for our September wedding in Petaluma, and he did not disappoint! We had booked him in 2019 and after a decision to change the date, he was very accommodating and ...

was able to book our new date. He provided amazing documents with top songs for inspiration. His online music selection platform was easy to use, and he was available for questions via email/phone when needed. We were able to get a good read from him on the multiple phone calls we had to touch base pre-wedding day. One of our priorities for the wedding was for the dancing and party to be memorable. The dance floor was busy all night and Michael was quick to fade music or take requests from guests!

Michael Luna is great!!! He was not only our dj but he and his wife are also who provided our photobooth. Talk about going above and beyond. His wife custom made our backdrop for o...

ur photobooth because they didn't have the color we wanted. So she went down to the fabric store and bought the fabric and made us new curtians for the background. What I also loved was that his wife was there helping the photobooth assistant glue the photo's into our memory book! I highly recommend that! It's only an extra $40 and you will crack up going through that book the day after your wedding. Now Michael is an expert at what he does. He knows his music like no one I've ever met. He wasn't late on one song. He didn't mess up once, he was so professional and prepared. My husband and I were extremely impressed. I highly recommit this dj.

Michael's personality is engaging and warm which puts you at ease when discussing musical choices. We used him for d.j. services as well as for uplighting and a photobooth. Our gue...

sts are still commenting on how much they loved the photobooth which was more playful and better quality than many others. The uplighting enhanced the dance floor and the uplighting professional steered us away from using one of our wedding colors (kelly green) in the main dance floor as it would be unflattering to guests in pictures. I particularly like it when service providers give honest feedback rather than simply going with what the customer wants. We used a little kelly green uplighting in a specific dining area and the photos weren't as flattering there. Overall, Michael and his team are warm, engaging professionals that want your wedding to be the best.

Michael is extremely professional and a dream to work with. He totally understood the ambiance our daughter and son-in-law were looking for. We are a fun family who loves to danc...

e and he kept the reception on-track and was great at keeping the energy of the party in full swing. Great selection and he included the maid of honor at the DJ station. We hated to leave at the end of the night. He's very responsible and a great listener who totally enjoy his job. Thanks so much Michael for helping make a delightful evening!

My husband and I went back on forth on if we should splurge on a dj or try to save money with our ipod. Ultimately, we are both so happy that we decided to use Michael as our DJ. ...

Michael is incredibly professional and easy to work with in music selection. He did a great job keeping our wedding on schedule and getting people onto the dance floor. Overall, two thumbs up!
