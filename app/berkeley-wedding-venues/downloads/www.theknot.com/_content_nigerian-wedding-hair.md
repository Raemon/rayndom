There are a lot of little details that go into putting together a Nigerian wedding, and one that every bride will want to pay attention to is the perfect Nigerian wedding hair. The right hairstyle isn't just about looking gorgeous, but is also about paying homage to your background and where you're from. "Traditional bridal hairstyles in Nigeria are deeply cultural," explains Nels of [Nelsbeautyhub](https://www.instagram.com/nelsbeautyhub/) and [okuku_stylistinlagos](https://www.instagram.com/okuku_stylistinlagos/), a bridal makeup artist and hairstylist located in Lagos, Nigeria. "The hairstyle a bride chooses is often tied to what's traditionally done in her community." The style will also often coordinate with or tie into Nigerian wedding attire, making for a cohesive look all around. 

We spoke with Nels and Lateefat Shinaba, gele artist and owner of [DiaspoGlow](https://www.diaspoglowbeauty.com/), to learn more about these beautiful Nigerian wedding hairstyles. If you're still in search of an artist for yourself, be sure to check out [The Knot Vendor Marketplace](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/beauty-services) to find vendor experts in Nigerian weddings near you.

## What to Know About Styling Nigerian Wedding Hair

While many Nigerian brides wear gele, traditional hairstyles can be beautifully diverse, and brides will often select a style based on where they are from. "Even within the same region, hairstyles can be different from state to state, and sometimes from village to village," Nels explains.

FEATURED VIDEO FROM THE KNOT

These [Black wedding hairstyles](https://www.theknot.com/content/black-wedding-hairstyles) are often heavily based on [Nigerian wedding traditions](https://www.theknot.com/content/cultural-traditions-nigeria) and will typically tie into the bride's outfit. "In some cultures, there are specific bridal colors to choose from," Nels says. "In others, the bride has a bit more freedom to customize her look." Many Nigerian brides will also show off more than one look at their wedding, so Nels recommends opting for a hairstyle that transitions easily or looks just as beautiful with a headwrap later in the day. 

While there are hundreds of different Nigerian tribes, we've focused mainly on Yoruba, Igbo and Edo brides in this article. 

### Yoruba Wedding Hair Traditions

Yoruba brides typically do not leave their hair out for a traditional wedding look. Instead, they'll tie gele, which means "headwrap" in Yoruba. Nigerian geles are made of a variety of different fabrics. "Most Yoruba brides go with aso oke, especially for weddings," Nels explains. "It's that thick, handwoven fabric that holds shape well." Geles typically match not only the bride's outfit, but also the groom's. "It's not just about looking nice," Nels says. "What they wear sets them apart from the guests. The color, the pattern, even how it's tied, all say, 'these are the couple.'" 

However, a gele head wrap is not the only option for Yoruba brides. Nels notes that in places like Owo, located in Ondo State, brides commonly style their hair in shuku, which is a raised cornrow style, or a high bun decorated with coral beads. This is a traditional style, but it's also still popular today, as Nels notes that many Owo brides mix in frontals or add hair extensions to the look.

### Igbo Wedding Hair Traditions

At traditional Igbo weddings (also called igbankwu), brides will typically wear at least two outfits and two different hairstyles. For the first look, Nels says that the bride often has their hair in a high or low bun depending on their preference. "The hair is styled using her natural hair with extensions to add shape and volume or with a frontal wig plus added hair for body," she says. This style can be decorated with red or white coral beads, which can also be worn on the neck, wrists, ankles and sometimes around the waist. 

When the bride changes into the second outfit, she typically wears a headwrap called ichafu (different Igbo communities have different words for this headwrap depending on the region). "It's usually tied in pleats that fan out to one side, kind of like a handmade paper fan," Nels explains. She notes that the fabric is important here, as it must have enough structure to hold up the style securely—most Igbo brides opt for materials like sego in colors like silver, gold or red, depending on what matches the bride's outfit. 

### Edo Wedding Hair Traditions 

The traditional hairstyle for an Edo bride is called okuku. This is often done with the bride's own hair, but she can also use a frontal wig and extensions for more volume and height. The okuku is a high bun that is completely covered with coral beads (some villages use white beads). Other accessories, such as a golden comb, may also be added. 

The okuku is meant to be paired with the classic red Edo outfit, which is called ododo. "These days, since the okuku styling process takes hours, some brides go for ready-made okuku pieces that can just be placed on the head," Nels says. "It still gives the full effect, just with less time and hassle." 

## Nigerian Wedding Hair Accessories

Hair accessories are just one important part of [Nigerian wedding attire](https://www.theknot.com/content/nigerian-wedding-attire). Hair isn't just styled into a bun or a ponytail—it is often accompanied by some sort of accessory that ties into the bride's culture and background. 

### Gele

Gele is a traditional Nigerian headwrap worn by women for special events and celebrations such as weddings. "It's more than just an accessory," Shinaba says. "It's a bold statement of beauty, cultural pride and joy." Gele is often made of a structured fabric, such as also oke, damask or sego materials, because it has to hold its shape really well. Gele is perfect for brides on their big day. "It gives that 'I've arrived' moment," Nels says. 

According to Nels, gele is styled by folding the fabric into pleats and building it as high or wide as it can go. This is usually done by a professional geek stylist for a bride, with a final look that Nels says "resembles a fan shape." Gele will typically coordinate with or match the bride's outfit. 

There is also the option for an autogele, which is a pre-tied gele that you would wear, similar to wearing a cap or hat. "It gives the look of a tied gele without the stress of wrapping," Nels says. She points out that an autogele is more commonly worn by guests rather than brides, since brides are trying to go for the kind of statement-making look you would get from a traditional gele.

### Coral Beads

Like gele, coral beads have a deep cultural meaning across many Nigerian communities. "They symbolize royalty, wealth, fertility and status, especially when worn during traditional weddings," Nels says. While often worn in hair, that's not the only way they can be incorporated into a wedding day look. Nels notes that coral beads can also be worn around the neck, wrists, ankles, ears and even the waist. 

Coral beads can be used in Edo bridal hairstyles, such as the okuku, to completely cover the updo for what Nels calls "a bold, crown-like look." She explains that some brides will wear beaded caps or crowns, and some will use them as decorative pins to embellish a bun. "They can also be made into long strings and wrapped neatly around the hair to frame the style," she says. 

When it comes to styling coral beads, remember their significance. "Beads should be arranged intentionally, not just scattered," Nels advises. "Clean lines and thoughtful placement make the style stand out." She stresses the importance of a solid, well-formed base, such as a bun, okuku or crown cap, especially since coral beads are heavy and need to be secured properly.

### Cowrie Shells

Like coral beads, cowrie shells have spiritual and cultural meaning and are not just a hair accessory. Their history includes the fact that they were once used as African currency and can now represent many things, including fertility, wealth and prosperity. Brides will sometimes incorporate cowrie shells into their wedding attire or hairstyle to bring good luck and fertility. However, Nels notes that cowrie shells aren't as popular an option for hairstyles, and that brides often opt for coral beads instead.

### Beaded Crowns

Beaded crowns can be found at Yoruba or Igbo weddings and are made up of an array of beads arranged into a crown-like shape (hence the name). These crowns are typically ornate and elaborate, and can have deeply spiritual and cultural meanings. They often consist of rows of beads and draped beads and are worn over a hairstyle, like a bun. The crowns are reminiscent of royalty.

### Golden Combs

Golden combs also have a deeper meaning and can be used in Edo weddings. They are often added to hairstyles as a finishing touch—for example, Nels notes that golden combs are typically added to okuku (the traditional Edo wedding hairstyle), something that gives the look "its royal touch." She adds, "Traditionally, that golden comb is reserved for princesses, so when you see it, it really elevates the whole look."

## How to Tie Gele

Gele is a statement-making accessory full of cultural significance, so properly tying them is key to a bridal look. "Geles are styled into stunning shapes—think pleats, fans, swirls or even rose-like designs," explains Shinaba. 

Tying gele isn't an easy task. "It isn't a widely known skill and takes a lot of practice," Shinaba says. "The key is pleating and keeping things straight." She recommends you [hire a wedding hairstylist](https://www.theknot.com/content/questions-to-ask-your-hairstylist) or a skilled girl artist who has experience tying gele, because she says the process can be time-consuming and confusing, especially if you've never done it before.

However, if you want to attempt it, Nels offered a step-by-step guide you can follow: 

  * Start with neat, packed hair. You want your hair flat and clean under the gele, so put it into a bun or underneath a wig cap or net. 
  * Place the gele on your head, ensuring that one side is longer than the other. Note that you'll be wrapping with the longer end. 
  * Hold the short end in place and begin wrapping the long end around your head, covering your hairline as you go. 
  * Keep wrapping in layers, stacking each fold neatly to build height and volume. Once you're happy with the height, tuck the remaining fabric into the folds and pin it in place if needed. 
  * Once that's done, it's time to shape and pleat the layers for a clean, structured fan look. Pin down any loose areas to keep everything tight and in place. 



## Nigerian Bridal Hair Inspiration 

For a traditional Nigerian wedding, brides choose their hairstyle and [bridal hair accessories](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-hair-accessories) based on their culture. "Your culture sets the tone, but you can always add a modern twist as long as it still honors tradition," Nels says. Below are a few Nigerian bridal hair inspirational photos to help you find your perfect bridal look.
