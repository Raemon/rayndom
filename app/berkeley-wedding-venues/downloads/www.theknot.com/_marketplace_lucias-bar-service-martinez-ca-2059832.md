at we were able to get custom menus made. They were so lovely to work with and were super responsive to my multiple texts and requests for calls to discuss our plans. They also helped us figure out exactly how much alcohol to buy which was super helpful. It was also great knowing that literally ALL we had to do was buy the alcohol and the rest was taken care of. Lucia showed up an hour early with EVERYTHING (I'm talking ALL mixers, ice, straws, cups napkins, waters, garnish...everything) she needed to bartend for the even including lemonade for the kiddos. She always made sure that my now husband and I had everything that we needed (drink wise) throughout the night and even went so far as to provide us with a detailed recipe of one of our signature cocktails after the fact for a guest who enjoyed it so much they wanted to make it for their next event. All in all, if you want your bar/bar tender to be something you don't have to worry about at all for your next event I highly suggest working with Lucia's. 10/10!

e made with a mix that Lucia and Chuck home-brewed. For example they offered a watermelon vodka, blueberry mint vodka, and spice mango margarita. Of course they made other non-seasonal cocktails such as an old fashion which Lucia's Bar Service brought their own cubes specially for that cocktail. I appreciated that Lucia's team made sure that my heavy drinking friends were cut off if they were taking too much or not being responsible. There was another party on the other side of the restaurant that was turning into a s*** show but my reception was still functioning and having a great time. Highly recommended!

My now husband and I knew we wanted to offer cocktails for our March wedding. We didn't know where to look and turned to Thumbtack for suggestions and that's where we stumbled upon...

Lucia's Bar Service. Right off the bat, I felt Lucia's warm and welcoming nature. She was very attentive to what we wanted, offered suggestions, and even suggested something for the kids which we didn't think about at the time. Lucia's extremely responsive to all my questions and it felt like talking to one of my Auntie's in all honesty. I always left the call with a smile on my face! We had a party of 92 guests and although there was a rush to the bar after the ceremony, Lucia and Chuck quickly operationalized and tag-teamed to keep the line at bay and quickly turnaround drinks to minimize the wait time. They work together so well and the line quickly dissipated as Chuck prepped, and Lucia finished off each drink. As for the quality of work, Lucia's cocktails are like no other. We initially selected the spicy mango margarita, paloma, and cucumber basil smash but had only purchased tequila to cut down on costs (it called for vodka and we didn't want to have to buy more alcohol than we've already purchased). She suggested changing the last drink to something more suitable for tequila and we landed on a blueberry mint smash. All of the drinks were delicious! We tried all 3 cocktails and you can tell that all the syrups were homemade and hand-crafted. You didn't get the sugary, residual flavor as you would in artificial syrups. Everyone raved about the cocktails - they were a huge hit and we even got some questions around who we had selected for our bar + drinks! Overall, I highly recommend Lucia. She is the sweetest bartender and I cannot wait to book again or hopefully see her at another event (Lucia - I plugged in my cousin who's getting married next year and hope that they choose you so I can get to try your cocktails once more!). Thank you so much!
