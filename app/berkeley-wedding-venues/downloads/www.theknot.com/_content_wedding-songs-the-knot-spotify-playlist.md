## Top 10 First Dance Wedding Songs

Just because you can't choose every song on our list for your first dance doesn't mean that the tunes can't be played later on during your event. Use the fun visual below as a reference while you're making your reception music playlist.

## Most Popular First Dance Songs

These are the popular first dance songs 2024 newlyweds played at their weddings. From classics to recent hits, see what everyone is dancing to. 

### 1\. "Can't Help Falling in Love" by Elvis Presley




**Lyrics you'll love:** "Take my hand / Take my whole life too / For I can't help / Falling in love with you"

Considered one of the [best first dance songs](https://www.theknot.com/content/classic-first-dance-songs), this tune finally took the top spot from Ed Sheeran's "Perfect." (Most likely because of the films _Elvis_ starring Austin Butler and _Priscilla_ starring Cailee Spaeny, which came out in 2022 and 2023 respectively.) But it's clear why this 1961 love song, made to complement Elvis' movie _Blue Hawaii_ , has been a favorite first dance wedding song for decades. It's easy to dance to and features swoon-worthy lyrics—and who doesn't love Elvis' rich, deep voice? There are numerous modern covers of this classic wedding song, performed by Haley Reinhart, U2, Britney Spears, Twenty One Pilots and Michael Bublé.

**You may also like:** "Love Me Tender" and "Sentimental Me" by Elvis Presley.

### 2\. "Joy of My Life" by Chris Stapleton




**Lyrics you'll love:** "She's sweet to me / Must be the luckiest man alive / Did I tell you, baby / You are the joy of my life?"

Many of the most popular first dance songs for weddings on our list come from the country genre. This Kentucky-born singer, whose debut album spent 500 weeks on the Billboard 200, has powerful vocals that'll put anyone in the mood for love. Also, we can't get enough of the song's message: The only thing that matters is being together. (**Reminder:**[How long the first dance takes](https://www.theknot.com/content/when-should-we-have-our-first-dance) is determined by you, but experts suggest it should be no longer than 90 seconds. So, even though "Joy of My Life" is a great song, don't play all four minutes and 35 seconds of it.)

### Find your kind of venue

From barns to ballrooms, discover reception venues that feel like you.

**You may also like:** "More Of You" and "It Takes a Woman" by Chris Stapleton.

### 3\. "Life With You" by Kelsey Hart




**Lyrics you'll love:** "Baby I love doing life with you / You're everything I wanna wake up to / Give you all of my heart / The moon and the stars / 'Til my time here on Earth is through"

Kelsey Hart's 2024 album, _Life With You_ , is full of [love songs](https://www.theknot.com/content/best-love-songs), and the album's title track is currently Hart's most-streamed song on Spotify. With lyrics like, "I'll be your forever and not just your sometimes," it makes sense why this song ranks number three on our most popular first wedding dance songs list. **Fun fact:** The "Life With You" music video features clips from Hart's wedding video.

**You may also like:** "Without You In It" and "Crazy 'Bout You" by Kelsey Hart.

### 4\. "At Last" by Etta James




**Lyrics you'll love:** "At last / My love has come along / My lonely days are over / And life is like a song"

We see numerous videos a day on social media of couples playing "At Last" at their celebrations. This is why it doesn't come as a surprise that the ditty is one of the most popular first dance songs at weddings. This 1961 tune is considered Etta James' signature song and was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999. From the heartfelt lyrics to James' sultry voice, the tune brings a sweeping and dramatic ambiance to your reception. It also makes a beautiful processional or [recessional song](https://www.theknot.com/content/ceremony-recessional-selections) for a wedding ceremony.

**You may also like:** "Something's Got a Hold On Me" and "My Dearest Darling" by Etta James.

### 5\. "Lover" by Taylor Swift




**Lyrics you'll love:** "Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand? / With every guitar string scar on my hand / I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover"

Taylor Swift has a lot of first dance song options, but this one is definitely a top pick. "Lover" is the title track of her 2019 album and is a dedication to Swift's now ex-boyfriend, Joe Alwyn. Swifties will want to play this pick from our most popular wedding first dance song list at some point during their reception, whether it's for the first dance or later in the evening. Remember to check out our roundup of [inappropriate first dance songs](https://www.theknot.com/content/7-romantic-songs-you-may-want-to-avoid-for-your-first-dance) too since Taylor Swift has a tune that makes the cut.

**You may also like:** "You Are In Love" and "Begin Again" by Taylor Swift.

### 6\. "Perfect" by Ed Sheeran




**Lyrics you'll love:** "Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms / Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song / When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful / I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight"

Yes, this Ed Sheeran love tune has been one of the most popular first dance songs for weddings for the past eight years, and it's easy to see why. This song has tear-jerking lyrics and a great tempo for dancing—check out the music video for proof. If you're looking for a twist on this often-played tune, try the "Perfect Duet" version featuring Beyoncé.

**You may also like:** "Thinking Out Loud" and "Photograph," by Ed Sheeran.

### 7\. "All Your'n" by Tyler Childers




**Lyrics you'll love:** "So I'll love you 'til my lungs give out, I ain't lyin' / I'm all your'n and you're all mine / There ain't two ways around it / There ain't no tryin' 'bout it"

Another Kentucky native, Tyler Childers put his heart and soul into this popular first dance song. It's rumored that the tune's lyrics, which highlight the hardships of being on the road and missing the one you love, are about Childers' wife, Senora May. If you and your partner want a song with a bluegrass/new-age country feel, this touching song is for you. And even if you don't pick this as your first dance song, tell your [wedding DJ](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/wedding-djs) it's a must-play for later on during the reception.

**You may also like:** "Lady May" and "Shake the Frost (Live)," by Tyler Childers.

### 8\. "Until I Found You" by Stephen Sanchez




**Lyrics you'll love:** "Oh, I used to say / I would never fall in love again until I found her / I said I would never fall, unless it's you I fall into"

Since you'll be first in the [wedding dance order](https://www.theknot.com/content/order-of-dances-wedding), take everyone's breath away with this song. Written by crooning pop singer, Stephen Sanchez, the tune's retro melody is perfect for those wanting an old-fashioned sound with modern touches. We have a feeling that more songs by this hit maker will be added to next year's first dance selections. 

**You may also like:** "I Need You Most of All" and "Send My Heart With a Kiss" by Stephen Sanchez.

### 9\. "In Your Love" by Tyler Childers




**Lyrics you'll love:** "We were never made to run forever / We were just meant to go long enough / To find what we were chasin' after / I believe I found it here / In your love" 

Surprise! It's Tyler Childers again with another romantic ballad. This tune is about waiting for a love that one knows is worth fighting for. The lyrics are powerful and gender neutral, which means they work for every newlywed's first dance. **Warning:** Only watch the music video if you're prepared to sob for the rest of the day. 

**You may also like:** "Song While You're Away" and "Her and the Banks" by Tyler Childers.

### 10\. "From the Ground Up" by Dan + Shay




**Lyrics you'll love:** "And we'll build this love from the ground up / Now 'til forever it's all of me, all of you / Just take my hand and I'll be the man your dad hoped I'll be"

Last, but not least, this slow waltz is the perfect tempo for first dance choreography. (Don't forget to grab some [wedding first dance tips](https://www.theknot.com/content/first-dance-tips) before finalizing your moves.) Plus, we think the heartwarming lyrics work for every fan of the three-time Grammy-winning pair. Listen for yourself, but we know this song would sound phenomenal performed by a live wedding band.
