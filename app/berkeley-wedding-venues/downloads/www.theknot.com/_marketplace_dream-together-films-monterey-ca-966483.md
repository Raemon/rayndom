We're obsessed and cannot stop watching it on repeat! We highly recommend Nico to anyone looking for a wedding videographer!

rapher said it was the best thing they ever did. I AGREE. Our teaser video and our full length 9 minute video are stunning. I couldn’t have imagined a better video than the one Nico produced. Nico was a joy to work with from the beginning – he was responsive, patient with our multiple questions and very clear in his communication. When we met the day of the wedding he was friendly, had a very calming presence and he blended in seamlessly. Ultimately, the final product blew us away and we are so happy we chose him to be our videographer. We highly recommend him to everyone!

ideographed for such a huge milestone, let alone all day, we felt very comfortable and at times didn't even notice that the cameras were there. Although we also hired a photographer, Nico + team truly captured our love story in ways a photograph would never be able to. Due to the unfortunate rain, we feared that we would have a less-than special day. However, Nico's artistic vision proved us wrong when in fact the rain only added to an already beautiful and memorable occasion. We highly recommend booking Dream Together Films if you're looking for excellent quality in both the creativity and the execution, with the added bonus of feeling as if you've known Nico + team for years upon meeting them. You won't regret it!

Let me start by saying that Nico is a really talented videographer. We absolutely loved his work. He is easy to work with. When planning our wedding we were looking for a modern vi...

deographer that has a good taste and is affordable. I am 100% happy with our choice. We couldn't find a better videographer. Before the wedding he was fast in responding to emails. He was very organized and planned everything well ahead of time. He gave us a list of musics for our video clip that we could choose from. He was also open to our suggestions. We had a Persian-American wedding and we would have loved to have a song that was Persian. He made it work for us. We sent him couple of songs and he managed to blend them in with other songs very well. I am sure filming a wedding that half of it happened in another language must be hard but Nico managed that very well. All our speeches were in a different language. He asked us to send him the translations and he perfectly chose parts of those speeches for the video clip. Nico comes to your wedding with a vision, a plan, and he looks for the scenes to realize that. His work is artistic and yet authentic. It looks real and this was what we were exactly looking for.

The search for a wedding videographer was one of the most difficult tasks during our wedding planning process. It seemed like every film we viewed online was cheesy and felt dated...

until we came across Dream Together Films. From start to finish Nico was INCREDIBLE to work with!! Not only was he easy to talk with during the planning process he genuinely has a passion for the art of videography. On our wedding day he moved effortlessly with our photographers, capturing every important detail. I honestly had no idea that Nico and Eddie were filming the entire day, it just felt as if they were part of our wedding. When we received the highlight film we were completely blown away. From the editing to the music selection Nico exceeded our expectations! Nico has given us the best gift of reliving our wedding day every time we watch. This was one of the most important vendor selections for us and I am so happy that we found Dream Together Films. Thank you Nico!!

Working with Dream Together Films for our wedding last winter in 2019 was absolutely delightful! We were referred to Nico by the hotel that hosted our wedding. After browsing his ...

website, we decided to go ahead and contact him. From the outset, he was very easygoing and great to work with. He responded promptly to our inquiry, and all of his packages were extremely reasonable and in-line with our expectations. One of Nico's greatest strengths is that he has great direction: he knows exactly what he needs us to do for the final film to turn out perfectly. He worked extremely well with our photographer as well, and continued to be laidback the whole day of the wedding (which we had booked 9 hours of coverage). He was also low maintenance and kept a low profile, and we never felt like he was an outsider on our wedding day. Lastly, his editing was out of this world. My wife and I were completely blown away by the final video that he made of us; we had never expected us to look so good! In fact, he made absolutely everything look good, from the venue, the guests, the food. Just a phenomenal experience all in all!

We highly recommend Dream Together Films for any of your videography needs! Nico and his team did our videography for our wedding and we can not say enough great things about them....

First- Nico was great about responding to any questions we had during the booking process and what would come with his services. Not to mention, he recommended other vendors that he had worked with that would allow our wedding to be put together easily. Second- himself and his team were SO respectful of our home and culture. They were also just awesome individuals! They made the day so stress-free and relaxed. Throughout the day they walked us through what we would be doing and why and checked in with us if we were happy with the location. We're so happy with working with them because they made our wedding day 10x better with their conversation, jokes and just chill personalities.

r work matched our style. No easy feat, right? Until I found Dream Together Films on The Knot.com. I was so obsessed with their work, it looked so beautiful, intentional, and like they really put themselves into each scene. I contacted them right away, and Nico got back to us quick and was very professional. We talked back and forth about what he thought would work best for us and it was clear that he knew what he was doing. I was so excited to have our wedding filmed! Day of the wedding, they were awesome. I did not have any sort of shots planned, I did not know what I was supposed to be doing haha. But they stepped in and ran the show. It was wonderful not needing to think about every little detail and to just trust them and enjoy the day. Another thing to mention, they were never "in the way", I work at an event center and it is the worst when the videographers are just all over the place and in the way wherever they go haha. These guys got the best shots without ever drawing attention to themselves. We just received our highlight video and it was better than anything I could have imagined. My dad had played an especially emotional song during our reception, and they perfectly captured it and started our video with it. It was so breathtaking and makes my dad tear up every time. My husband had been feeling sick and terrible, but when we sat down to watch the video he said: "Maybe we should just keep playing the video over and over cause I felt better while watching that than I have all week!" And everyone who has watched it says it is the best wedding video they have ever seen, and I 100% agree. Thank you for perfectly capturing the best day of our lives. We are beyond grateful for this very special film and will treasure it forever!

Nico is the BEST!! We were originally not planning on having a videographer for our wedding, but our parents talked us into it. We did a little research online and LUCKILY stumbled...

across Nico – we couldn’t be happier that we used him to document such an important day. He was excellent with communication leading up to the wedding, his prices were really reasonable (especially for the amazing quality), and he was so easy to work with. We didn’t actually meet him in person until the wedding day, but the second we did, we knew we were in great hands. He did an incredible job of being everywhere we wanted him, without being intrusive or feeling like he was in the way of guests having a good time. He was also just SO nice, and fun to be around. Best part? The video is SO AWESOME. He caught all the big moments that you would expect to be in your wedding video – but also honed in on some really amazing small moments too. He’s clearly VERY good at what he does. I would recommend Nico ten times over for wedding videography (but also just any videography in general). Thank you Nico!!!

The entire process with Nico was almost too easy - something you can't really say about many wedding planning searches. While looking for a videographer, I wasn't finding anyone wh...

o matched our style or who was even close to affordable for the quality they were showing. I finally stumbled upon Dream Together Films and loved the videos they had previously done, I didn't even send an e-mail to any other videographer, I knew I needed Nico and his team for my wedding. From start to finish Nico was super responsive via e-mail and even checked in with us along the way with some homework (picking out the songs we wanted for our film if we chose to use our own, which we did). We just received our wedding video last week and we were blown away, tears and all reliving our special day. Nico and his team really captured every important detail, even ones we would have never thought to include. The drone footage really put our video over the top along with the perfect cutting of the songs we had chosen. When I was looking at wedding budget my now husband said we should make some cuts but I knew I wouldn't regret spending that extra money on a videographer, I couldn't have been more right - don't second guess a videographer, especially one as great as Nico. Don't look anywhere else because you won't find a better team who sees every detail so beautifully and differently than you could ever imagine. Thank you so much, Nico and team, for delivering such amazing service and outstanding work!

We booked Dream Together Films after finding him on The Knot about two years before our wedding date. Even though we were super early, we knew that we really liked his style and hi...

s price points were in our budget, so we wanted to book him ASAP. Nico was very responsive via email (which is very important to a wedding planning couple lol) and overall the pre-wedding process (choosing songs/ figuring out logistics/ etc.) was very easygoing. The day of the wedding, Nico and his assistant were awesome! They worked very well with our photographer and her assistant and they genuinely looked like they were enjoying themselves and our crazy wedding party + guests! Now, the final video - We got our video about two and a half months after the wedding, which was earlier than we anticipated. Words cannot describe how happy we were after watching the final product. The film brought back all of the good feelings and vibes of the day. While watching it, we teared up, we laughed, and we got to see our wedding from a different perspective. Nico was able to make the songs that we wanted fit perfectly. Our song choices weren't "typical" wedding film songs, but they fit our vibe and the vibe of our wedding beautifully. Thank you so much to Nico and Dream Together Films for perfectly encapsulating our wedding day! We would highly recommend him for your wedding videographer needs! He's fantastic!

Nico and his crew was a pleasure to work with and his final product exceeded all our expectations. He did a fantastic on our highlight video and every time I watch it, I still get goosebumps.

I am so happy I found Nico! While researching endless lists of videographers for our wedding, his style immediately stood out to me. He captures emotions beautifully, and there is ...

something so personal, tender, and intimate about his films. With his super reasonable prices, drone coverage, and great communication skills, this was such an easy decision for me. Fast forward to wedding day - I was a super high maintenance bride. I was unfortunately deathly ill on my big day, and there were many delays, accommodations, and modifications. Nico was super chill and patient, worked hard the entire time (even while I was taking many long breaks in my bridal suite), and reassured me that he was confident that he could make an amazing video for us. He was kind enough to return to the venue with us for a re-shoot a few weeks later to capture some sunset footage, which I had been too sick to do on wedding day. The final product is simply AMAZING. The transitions, detail shots, song choices, emotions...he absolutely nailed it. I have watched it countless times already, and it still makes me teary every single time. To be honest, I had been holding onto a lot of sadness about our wedding day because I was too sick to fully participate or enjoy it. All of that grief disappeared after I saw the beautiful video. Thank you Nico! I am so grateful for the wonderful memories you captured.

Nico is a wonderful and talented videographer, I had the privilege of working with him for my wedding this past June. I picked Dream Together Films almost 10 months before the wedd...

ing day. My husband and I wanted to select our videographer before the other vendors because we were the most selective and opinionated about the video. While researching we watched over a hundred video examples from other vendors and made note of the tone, style, music, b-roll, details we liked and didn't want... Ultimately when we found Nico's portfolio and reached out for more information, we knew he was the one who'd be able to capture our wedding perfectly. And having just received our highlight and documentary films back, I'm so pleased with the final result! Nico delivered us the highlight and documentary films in less than 2 months from the day, much earlier than we thought so it was a super pleasant surprise! Nico was extremely easy to work with, as we were high-level planning and discussing vision and parts of the ceremony and rehearsal that we wanted to focus on. As we got closer to the day and began discussing day-of details and timelines, Nico was extremely helpful in advising on logistics. As the big day arrived, Nico and his assistant were extremely punctual, reliable and kept a calm demeanor throughout the day. Nico's prices are VERY reasonable, given the quality of video and editing work you're getting. I researched many videographers who charged much more for much less... On top of the highlight film, I'm also so pleased that I opted for more reception coverage because now that the wedding is over, I've rewatched my highlight AND documentary film over 20 times. All of my family has also commented on how amazing the editing was and how well the different scenes flow, what amazing vision and shots Nico was able to get and include, how incredible the drone footage was, and what a joy it has been to remember the special day again. I'm extremely happy with Nico and Dream Together Films! He was by far the best vendor I worked with and I'm so happy with the result! I cannot stress how pleased my husband and I and both our families are with the result. The films are beautiful and make me cry and smile all over again and remember the magic of the day. I will always cherish the memories of my wedding, and I'm so thankful to have these details captured in these films. Thank you so much Nico for your talent and vision!

Nico is AMAZING! My husband was very selective with videography and he searched high and low to find someone. And when he discovered Nico’s work, he immediately showed me with much...

anticipation. We immediately knew that we wanted Dream Together Films as our wedding videographer. Nico’s filming style, equipment, communication, and package aligns best with our needs. And we reviewed and compared 22 different vendors! On the day of our wedding, Nico was incredible to work with. None of us has ever had a camera follow us around before so we were pretty nervous and clueless as to what to do or how to position ourselves to get the most optimal footage. However, with Nico’s and Shaun’s guidance, they made the process very fun and painless. By the end of the night, we didn’t even notice they were there! Prior to our wedding day, Nico reached out to inform us that we booked him for 9 hours and our wedding only ran for 8 hours. He proposed using the extra hour to get drone footage of the surrounding area of Nestldown or getting ready footage. To our delight, we sincerely appreciated Nico’s transparency and honesty! Fast forward 2.5 months after our wedding, we received our highlight video from Nico. And needless to say, we were IMPRESSED with his work. He captured every raw moment and magically stitched together a beautiful story of our special day and loved ones. Because of Nico’s work, we are able to relive every detail of our special day till we’re old and wrinkly ;) It is a bonus when our family and friends rave about our highlight film. We can’t recommend Nico enough. He is very talented, professional, and a pleasure to work with! If you’re looking for a spectacular videographer with a great personality then Nico is your guy! You won't be disappointed.

By far - the easiest vendor we hired to work with! After combing through instagram, theknot.com and a few other wedding websites to try to figure out what we were looking for in a ...

wedding videographer, we came across Nico. From browsing through his portfolio, we loved his dreamy film editing style and the cohesive way he showcased the day of events to seamlessly relive the major moments of a wedding. We also especially appreciated his selection of music choices -- he offered an eclectic variation of songs that could evoke emotion without being overly sappy or too ‘mainstream’. Throughout the planning process, Nico was super easy to communicate with via email/phone and always prompt to respond. As the day of the wedding came closer, I was nervous about the idea of having a camera around, given our lack of prior experience with being filmed to this degree. Nico and his team were amazing in being able to capture the small details and special moments throughout the day without feeling intrusive. They also were super laid back and worked well with the rest of the vendors (day of coordinator, photographer, etc). Nico delivered the final video in a timely manner (less than 3 months after the wedding date). Both my husband and I are so thrilled with how the final video turned out; Nico was amazing at capturing the mood of the day as well as the essence of our personalities. Our family and friends loved the video when we shared it with them and were so impressed with Nico’s film. We are so, so glad we found him to film our wedding day!!

Nico was our videographer for our wedding, and I have already watched our film over a dozen times (which is maybe a little excessive but hey, that’s nothing compared to how many ho...

urs we spend planning these things, right?). We were initially not sure what we wanted in a videographer or even if we needed one, but after watching some of his films, talking to him on the phone, and realizing that his name is my name shortened, I was confident he would be a great fit. And, he was! Here is what I appreciated most: 1) His communication - he was quick to respond and very professional. He was also was very open to my ideas. 2) His pricing - speaks for itself. 3) His chill spirit - he did a great job of unassumingly capturing special moments at our wedding. 4) The final product - We love his editing style (how it’s not so mushy that I want to cringe) and the music and, seriously, all. of. it. One of my friends even commented that our video changed her mind about having a videographer at her future wedding! (I like to think it’s because I’m in it, but I know it’s probably not.)

guests. They were very chill about us being slightly disorganized while getting ready, and didn't complain once about the unexpected heat that day. They also worked really well with our photographers. Leading up to the big day, communication with Nico was easy. I responded late a couple times and he was always nice about it! He accepted song requests for our highlight video, as well as offered his own list of suggestions. I would definitely recommend Dream Together Films to anyone in need of videography!

Working with Dream Together Films (Nico) was one of the BEST decisions we made in planning for our wedding. Initially my now-husband and I weren't even going to hire a videographer...

since we're both camera shy but after talking to a few close friends and reading about how not having a videographer was one of the biggest regrets of newlyweds, we decided to just do it and we're SO happy with our decision. I did a lot of research on videographers and after watching a few of Dream Together's production via vimeo, we decided to book them. Nico exceeded all our expectations! He was extremely easy to communicate with throughout the process, super professional, and did an AMAZING job on our video! People forget that when you're actually in the wedding, you wont actually see a lot of ceremony/reception ( bridal party walk-out, family members reactions, etc) and Nico captured everything perfectly. Book Dream Together Films now and I promise you won't regret it!

A great videographer is someone who can capture the special moments with a clear plan, tactfully, and most importantly, inconspicuously — Nico and his team executed on all of those...

. Nico was an absolutely fantastic partner to work with on our special day. With all the millions of other things we had to think about to get the day right, managing him and his partner was not among them. They had no problem going with our flow, adapted heroically to every situation to get the shots they needed, and captured our day seamlessly. The final product he delivered speaks for itself to his creativity and the joy he derives from his craft. We'd strongly recommend Nico to others!

Hands down, Nico is AMAZING. When I was researching videographers I was 1) a bit hesitant that we even needed a videographer 2) Not sure if I wanted to allocate my wedding budget t...

owards this. I am SO glad that we hired him! His price is actually one of the most reasonable out of the 20 videographers I researched- yes- I researched 20 ! And the return on investment is amazing. Here is our experience with Nico: Booking & Communication leading up until the wedding: Great! He was nice and friendly through email and made great suggestions for our music choices. He was also quick to respond. I gave him really no direction of what I really wanted for the big day, quite honestly because I didn't know what to expect. He accepted payments on Venmo which made the transaction simple. Out of all the vendors I was working with for the wedding, Nico was the easiest and most straightforward to work with. Day of Experience: Nico arrived on time and was courteous of my brother's house and our wedding party as we were getting ready, and didn't get in the way at all. He introduced himself very quickly, and after that, he was quietly working the entire time. He stayed out of all of our photographers shots and was able to work with our photographers nicely even though they hadn't worked an event together before. Highlight Film: ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL. It arrived about 3 months after the event and it is beyond my wildest dreams. Nico sent me the link to the video in the morning while I was at work, and I tried to wait for my husband in the evening to watch it together with him- but I couldn't wait! I was in tears and watched it about a dozen times at work and all of my coworkers started watching it with me sobbing at my desk. Hah! The entire film looks like a movie! He captured the love and energy from the entire day- everything from getting ready in the morning to the dancing in the evening. Most importantly he really got our vibe and personality- I think the film really represents us well as a couple and our 10 years together and what an amazing wedding day we had. I was self conscious about how I thought I'd look on video- but he works magic!! He made every single guest at our wedding look great- including myself and my husband. This is hands down one of the most important investments on your wedding day that you NEED to make. 4 months after the wedding, I already forgot a lot of important feelings and memories since it's such an overwhelming day. But every time I watch the highlight film, I am reminded of what a beautiful day it was. This was worth every penny. Go with Nico- he is amazing!!! Don't tell my friends- but my wedding video is better than theirs. :)

ne and email with Nico prior to the wedding. He helped us work on a few modifications to his default contract that were important to us. He was also responsive in communicating with our coordinator about scheduling details. On the big day, Nico was punctual and professional. My wedding day was so intense that I don't remember too many details about what he was doing. However, the proof is really in the pudding -- he delivered us a great video. Nico is young and hard-working. I have no doubt that in a couple years he is going to be a brand name wedding videographer and his prices are going to be outrageous. I feel lucky that I got to hire him before that happened!

from the details in the decorations, capturing a sweet dance move, or quiet moments between bride and groom. Lively and well matched to the music, Nico was able to turn around a fantastic product in a short amount of time to accommodate our needs for an overseas reception. Nico is polite, fun, and professional, as he unobtrusively obtains great footage and demonstrated flexibility and initiative when working with the planning through the whole process. We love our wedding video and would highly recommend Nico for any of your special occasions. Thanks Nico!

a better videographer. On our wedding day he was so easy to work with and was never in any way intrusive or obstructive, but still captured every important moment. This was by far my favorite quality of his, you didn't really notice him, but he still somehow managed to capture it all. His finished product was nothing short of a tear jerker. We watched the video and couldn't help but get goosebumps at the footage, it just brought back all the emotions from the day. Little things you forgot about or were too busy to notice, he captures it all and allows you to relive it again and again. We can't say it enough, seriously talented individual, and we wouldn't have wanted anyone one else filming our special day. Great work Nico!!!

ace, so I had to base my decision on what I could find online and through email and phone calls. Nico's website impressed me, and his prices were very reasonable. Even so, I could not have imagined how well the short film turned out! I find myself playing it with my new husband rather frequently even months later, and when I show my friends, they remark how professional the film looks! There was a song that my husband and I really wanted to have in the film, and Nico was even able to make that happen as well as pick another great song that really brought out the fun we had! I am grateful for Nico and the hard work his team put in for our wedding, and would highly recommend him for anyone looking for a quality job, especially in the Santa Cruz region!

As my wedding approached I was hesitant to get a videographer as I thought I would only watch it once, after working with Nico Im glad we did. Nico was very wonderful to work with,...

and a pleasure to have around at such a hectic time. When people say the day goes by fast, they arent lying! Nico was very creative when working with our wedding photographer, and also for a photoshoot he did for us. After getting our pictures back from the photo shoot Nico did for us, I wish he was our wedding day photographer. He worked with our budget, and made the experience pain free. He is very easy going, and comfortable to work with. Unlike our wedding photographer, Nico made everything was fun to have around us, and made the day feel at ease. We would definitely recommend Nico to anyone looking for a photograpgher/videograpgher who is not only courteous, professional, but also a fun to be around.

When selecting my vendors for my Northern California wedding, I did not originally think about videographers as I thought I would only want photos from our special day. I was conce...

rned the videographer would be in the way or make people including the groom feel uncomfortable thus hindering any real emotions. After my mother insisted I have one for all the family who wouldn't be attending, I searched a bit and came across Nico's profile online. He was quick to respond and had very reasonable prices. The day of the wedding Nico worked effortlessly with my photographer (booked separately) to capture the most touching moments. Half way through our short and sweet ceremony, I was grateful knowing it was being captured on video because I realized then how quickly the day goes by. Just based on the highlight version I received from Nico, I couldn't be happier. From shots of the estate and garden to getting ready clips with our bridal party, Nico captured the emotion and anticipation leading up to our first look. His use of parts of our vows over moments of me and my husband during the photo shoot have already made several of our friends and family cry happy tears. His selection of music was perfect for the highlight video that portrayed all the fun that followed the ceremony including first dances, toasts, mingling of guests and a vibrant dance floor. I couldn't have asked for a better highlight - family and friends who couldn't attend said they felt like they were there at our backyard fairytale of a day. We've been thinking how much we wish we could relive it all over again and now I know we can thanks to Nico's marvelous work.
