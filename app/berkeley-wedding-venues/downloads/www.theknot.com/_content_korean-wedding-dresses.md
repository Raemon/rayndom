As the national garment of Korea, worn by both men and women during special occasions, these gowns are a testament to the nation's vibrant culture, and their celebratory nature makes them perfect for weddings. For Korean nearlyweds, or couples planning a multicultural celebration, sporting a traditional Korean wedding dress offers a way to honor their heritage while saying "I do."

## What Is a Traditional Korean Wedding Dress?

During [Korean weddings](https://www.theknot.com/content/korean-wedding-traditions), the bride will typically wear a garment known as a hanbok. But what is a hanbok exactly? According to Park, "the hanbok is a traditional Korean dress known for its graceful lines, vibrant colors and symbolic designs." While anyone, including the groom and wedding party, can wear a hanbok to a Korean wedding, the bride's is typically the most elaborate, colorful and decorated. "The bride's hanbok usually consists of a jeogori (top) and chima (skirt)," Park explains. During the [paebaek ceremony](https://www.theknot.com/content/paebaek-ceremony) (or tea ceremony), brides will usually layer a hwarot or wonsam (ceremonial robe) over the top of the hanbok. The most common accessory worn with the hanbok dress is a jokduri, or bridal crown.

"Traditional wedding hanboks are made of silk or fine silk blends, which create elegant draping and sheen," says Park. However, according to Kwon, many designers are expanding their options to include modern cotton blends, lace, satin, and synthetic fabrics that allow for more versatility, ease of care and accessibility. "While these innovations make hanboks more wearable in everyday contexts, many luxury and ceremonial pieces still use heritage silks and handwoven ramie to preserve craftsmanship and authenticity," he explains.

As for hanbok colors, "a bride traditionally wears a red skirt and a yellow or green top, symbolizing harmony, vitality and prosperity," Park explains. "However, brides who seek more modern and contemporary styles will wear white, gold, and even black hanboks," she adds. There are various hanbok color meanings associated with sentiments such as modesty, prosperity and wealth.

## Modern Hanbok and Korean Wedding Dress Ideas

As wedding traditions continue to evolve, it's becoming increasingly common to see brides wear a Korean bridal dress for just the paebaek ceremony, and a Western wedding dress for the main ceremony and reception. Others opt for a modern hanbok wedding dress that draws inspiration from traditional Korean attire while still reflecting contemporary trends. According to Kwon, "modern hanboks often preserve the essence of the original silhouette, while introducing subtle refinements in fit, fabric and proportions. "While some contemporary pieces feature slimmer skirts or shorter hemlines, many designers intentionally maintain the hanbok's timeless structure to honor its cultural identity while making it wearable today," he says.

Brides can also incorporate symbolic details without replicating the silhouette of a Korean hanbok. "Embroidery featuring culturally meaningful motifs, like cranes, butterflies, or peonies, can carry heritage subtly into a gown," Kwon explains. "A mother-of-pearl inspired sheen or a color palette drawn from Korea's traditional five-color spectrum (obangsaek), such as blues, reds, and whites, can also create a quiet yet powerful connection to Korean artistry." According to Kwon, "there are countless ways to honor Korean heritage in a way that feels authentic and personal while blending tradition with a contemporary design language."

## How to Choose a Wedding Gown for a Korean Wedding

"In modern Korean weddings, most guests wear contemporary formalwear, while hanboks are typically reserved for the couple and immediate family, especially the mothers of the bride and groom during the paebaek," says Kwon. So how can brides distinguish their Korean wedding dresses from those of their guests? Well, according to Kwon, "bridal hanboks are traditionally more elaborate and symbolic, often featuring rich, celebratory colors like red and gold and detailed embroidery symbolizing longevity, prosperity, and fidelity. This distinction allows the bridal hanbok to remain a unique, meaningful centerpiece within the celebration."

When choosing a Korean style wedding dress, decide what details are important to _you_. If the hanbok color meanings strongly resonate with you, consider wearing an option in red. However, if you are more drawn to other culturally significant motifs, you can incorporate them into your bride hanbok or wedding gown through embroidery or accessories.
