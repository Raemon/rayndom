It's no secret that music sets the tone for your wedding day, which is why your playlist should feel just as personal as your vows. After all, the best Black wedding songs do more than just sound good or set the vibe—they add meaning and emotional weight to each part of the day. We know it sounds like a lot of pressure, but the process can be just as fun as it is personal. That said, if you're not sure where to begin, The Knot Vendor Marketplace is a great place to find[ wedding DJs](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/wedding-djs) or[ live wedding bands](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/live-wedding-bands) who can help bring your vision to life.

As you're narrowing down your list,[ Keanna O'Quinn](https://www.sonicsomm.com/about), founder and CEO of[ Sonic Sommelier](https://www.sonicsomm.com/) in New York City and Los Angeles (and former [The Knot Ones to Watch](https://www.theknot.com/content/ones-to-watch) honoree), suggests creating a separate playlist of songs that define your relationship milestones. Your wedding playlist should feel like an audio love letter—not just songs you like, but songs that sound like your love story," she says. From there, try to zero in on any patterns. For example: "Are you drawn to storytelling lyrics? Rhythmic beats that make you move? Soulful vocals that give you chills?"

Finally, keep in mind that there truly are no "bad" music choices—as long as the song is meaningful to you. As O'Quinn puts it, "The goal isn't perfection, it's authenticity."

## 1\. "Is This Love," Corinne Bailey Rae

**Lyrics you'll love:** "I wanna love you/And treat you right/I wanna love you/Every day and every night"

"The songstress's version of the Bob Marley & The Wailers classic is a favorite for all of the right reasons," says O'Quinn. "In addition to capturing the essence of the original, it's just enough of a sonic departure to keep the listen interesting." The sultry rhythm makes it a fun pick for a first dance; alternatively, have your wedding band or DJ play it softly in the background during dinner or cocktail hour.

## 2\. "Best Part," Daniel Caesar (feat. H.E.R.)

**Lyrics you'll love:** "I just wanna see how beautiful you are/You know that I see it, I know you're a star/Where you go, I'll follow, no matter how far/If life is a movie, know you're the best part, ooh"

According to O'Quinn, this [R&B wedding song](https://www.theknot.com/content/rb-wedding-songs) is a top choice amongst couples for the first dance or during dinner." Its simple stripped-down melody, heartfelt lyrics and smooth vocals set the tone for a memorable moment on the dance floor.

## 3\. "Kiss of Life," Sade

**Lyrics you'll love:** "When I was led to you, I knew you were the one for me/I swear the whole world could feel my heartbeat"

If you're searching for Black processional wedding songs with soul and sophistication, look no further than this timeless track. According to O'Quinn, it works beautifully as a ceremony processional, during dinner or even for the first dance. "The opening instrumentation, particularly the bass, draws the listener in," she tells The Knot. "The lyrics tell a story of gratitude for a love that feels warm, protecting and reviving."

### Find your kind of venue

From barns to ballrooms, discover reception venues that feel like you.

## 4\. "Let's Stay Together," Al Green

**Lyrics you'll love:** "Oh baby/Let's, let's stay together ('gether)/Lovin' you whether, whether/Times are good or bad, happy or sad"

Equal parts timeless and soulful, Al Green's 1972 hit remains one of the most iconic Black love songs across generations. According to O'Quinn, it's best played during cocktail hour or as a warm, familiar track to welcome guests into the reception.

## 5\. "Ain't No Mountain High Enough," Marvin Gaye & Tammi Terrell

**Lyrics you'll love:** Ain't no mountain high enough/Ain't no valley low enough/Ain't no river wide enough/To keep me from gettin' to you, baby

When it comes to first dance songs for Black weddings, few are as enduring as this Motown classic. Put simply, says O'Quinn, "a good song is a good song," and this one has withstood the test of time, remaining what she so accurately describes as "a go-to love song." Additionally, "It's the most highly requested first dance song by far." 

## 6\. "Beyond," Leon Bridges

**Lyrics you'll love:** "She might just be my everything and beyond"

A standout among Black wedding first dance songs, this soulful[ Leon Bridges love song](https://www.theknot.com/content/spotify-wedding-playlist-by-leon-bridges) blends vulnerability and vocal power. According to Atlanta-based DJ[ Jay Page](https://www.onenightatl.com/team/jay-page), also known as DJ Aetii, it "fills a void that has been missing in soul music."

Playing this nostalgia-inducing hit is a surefire way to hype up your guests. "No matter the crowd, Fat Man Scoop's voice brings so much energy to the room," says Page. "It also allows us to bridge the '90s and 2000s together." 

## 10\. "All of Me," John Legend

**Lyrics you'll love:** "'Cause all of me/Loves all of you/Love your curves and all your edges/All your perfect imperfections/Give your all to me/I'll give my all to you/You're my end and my beginning/Even when I lose, I'm winning/'Cause I give you all of me"

"All of Me" is considered one of the popular [John Legend wedding songs](https://www.theknot.com/content/john-legend-wedding-song-a-good-night)—and for good reason. Its swoon-worthy lyrics and heartfelt melody make it a go-to romantic pick. While it's most often used as a first dance song, it also works beautifully for walking down the aisle or during a slow, emotional moment at the reception.

## 11\. "Signed, Sealed, Delivered (I'm Yours)," Stevie Wonder

**Lyrics you'll love:** "Oo, baby, here I am, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours!"

When it comes to selecting the perfect Black recessional wedding songs, this one takes the (wedding) cake with its joyful energy and iconic hook.

## 14\. "DJ Got Us Fallin' In Love," Usher (feat. Pitbull) 

**Lyrics you'll love:** "'Cause baby, tonight/The DJ got us falling in love again (love again)"

Throw it back to the early 2010s by having the DJ or band play this club-ready hit. As one of–if not the most—high-energy[ Usher wedding songs](https://www.theknot.com/content/usher-wedding-songs), it's perfect for getting guests on their feet during the reception. 

## 15\. "Last Dance," Donna Summer
