Christian was absolutely incredible to work with from start to finish! He took the time to truly understand our vision, and the final video felt like us in every way. The drone foo...

tage he captured was stunning—cinematic, creative, and unlike anything we’ve ever seen in a wedding film. He was so easy to work with throughout the entire process: responsive, organized, calm, and always willing to go the extra mile to make sure we felt comfortable and excited. On the day of the wedding, he blended in seamlessly, capturing every moment naturally while still guiding us when we needed it. We couldn’t be happier with the final product and will treasure it forever. We HIGHLY recommend Christian to anyone looking for a talented videographer who truly cares about bringing your story to life!

lt natural and at ease throughout the day. He worked incredibly well with our photographer and planner, which made a huge difference in the overall flow of the different parts of the day. Christian filmed some amazing shots with his drone and edited our video to feel like a movie. When we received our video back, we were so happy with the final result. Christian took the time to set the scene with his editing and share important clips with our loved ones, and the fun moments of our reception. He truly captured the magic of our wedding. We received so many compliments from family and friends on the quality of our video. Three years later, and we are still obsessed with what Christian created! Don't hesitate to book him for your wedding day!

I spent weeks searching for a wedding videographer and honestly dreaded every second of it. Every reel I watched looked the same, boring, formulaic, and sometimes even cheesy/cring...

ey. Nothing felt genuine or captured the couple’s real personality. Then I found Christian’s work. Within minutes of watching his videos, I felt an emotional connection I hadn’t felt with anyone else’s. His style is authentic and genuinely reflective of who the couple is. I knew instantly that my search was finally over! Working with Christian was effortless. He understood what we wanted without needing every detail spelled out, and he stayed patient and supportive through three COVID postponements. On the wedding day, he somehow managed to be everywhere at once while still being completely unobtrusive. I never felt awkward for a single moment, and that comfort made SUCH a difference in our video. When he delivered our videos, his choice of music absolutely perfected the entire film. It elevated every moment and matched the emotion of the day so beautifully. He also included all the raw footage, which let us see the joy, laughter, and behind-the-scenes moments he had been quietly capturing—especially with our family members. The final video took our breath away. Watching it brought me right back to our wedding, and everyone who has seen it ends up in tears too. Hiring Christian was one of the best decisions we made for our wedding. His work doesn’t just document your day—it pulls you back into the love, emotion, and connection you felt, and THAT is priceless. If you’re on the fence, please trust him. He will capture your story in a way you’ll cherish for the rest of your life. Thank you Christian!

Our video blew us away and we have received endless compliments on how he perfectly captured mine and my husbands personalities. We can't thank him enough for all the time and effort he put in to help make our wedding video something we will treasure forever. You will not regret hiring Christian to capture your day!
