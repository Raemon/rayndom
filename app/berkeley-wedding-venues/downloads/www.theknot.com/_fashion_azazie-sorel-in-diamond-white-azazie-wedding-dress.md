Description

The Sorel dress is a playful yet elegant mini ball gown crafted from lace and tulle, perfect for wedding celebrations. Its strapless sweetheart neckline, removable straps, exposed boning, and button-back detail pair beautifully with a voluminous pleated skirt for a look that’s both flirty and refined.
