Description

Modern and sophisticated, the Joylin gown is a floor-length trumpet silhouette designed for the mother of the bride, crafted from luxurious floral jacquard fabric. With an asymmetrical one-shoulder neckline, a delicate opposite strap, soft pleating through the bodice and hip, and a chic leg slit, it’s a statement of refined elegance.
