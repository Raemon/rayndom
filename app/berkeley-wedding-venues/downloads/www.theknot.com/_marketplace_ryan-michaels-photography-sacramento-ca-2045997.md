I consider it the highest honor and a tremendous blessing to be able to memorialize life’s most precious events through the medium of fine art photography.

I am humbled that my fine art imagery has won National photography competitions, and have been published in many magazines. My work has been featured on websites such as The Knot, Wedding Wire, Zola, Wedding Bean. and more. Expertise.com ranked my work as #1 in the area!

Response from Ryan Michaels Photography on 09/29/2025

Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. I’m truly glad to hear that you love...

d your portraits and that you felt our pricing was fair. I put a lot of care into capturing your wedding day (and we did give you an AMAZING deal by charging for a City Hall wedding at $1,500 instead of the normal $3,600 photo and video option). I’m sorry to hear you were disappointed in certain parts of your experience. To clarify a few points: I did photograph the ceremony from an angle that allowed me to capture both the processional and your husband’s reactions, which you specifically emphasized beforehand. Every child was photographed during the aisle walk (without bathrooms?). I understand that artistic angles can sometimes differ than what couples envision. I also strongly believe friends and family come to see your wedding not my backside so I tend to position myself out of the way. As for your gallery, it was fully culled and edited. I also sorted all of your high resolution images into folders to make it easier to navigate. My approach has always been to deliver a complete story of the day, which means couples receive many images rather than a restricted selection — most of my clients see this as a bonus! I’m sorry if it felt overwhelming in your case. The beauty of the admin controls is that you are welcome to use the HIDE feature if you feel there are any photos you don't want to be included in the gallery. Regarding video delivery, turnaround is typically 90 days. Your 4K films are still in the editing process, and I want to assure you they will be delivered within that timeframe, with beauty and professional cinematic artwork. I’m grateful you acknowledged the value of your package and quality of our portraits. After receiving your amazing wedding video, and thinking about the value and quality of all the work, I'm certain you'll revisit this review and allow us to earn those other three stars back.

We feel incredibly lucky to have found Ryan Michaels Photography for our wedding. From the very beginning, the experience was seamless — Ryan is so personable and warm. The email a...

nd phone call exchanges feel more like talking with a friend rather than a vendor. Ryan provided both a photographer and a videographer, which was something we didn’t think we could afford until we saw his pricing. Because of his fair and thoughtful packages, we didn’t have to choose between photos or video — we got both. The team Ryan sent out was not only professional but truly passionate about their work. You could feel that they cared about capturing every important moment, not just for the job, but because they knew how much it meant to us. Thanks to Ryan Michaels Photography, we’ll be able to show our future kids not just the photos of our special day, but also relive the moments — my dad walking me down the aisle, our first dance, and everything in between — through video. That means the world to us. We’re so grateful for the care, quality, and heart that Ryan and his team put into documenting our wedding. Highly recommend!

at made them stand out: Fun & Natural: Right from our engagement shoot to the big day, Ryan made us feel at ease. He has an incredible ability to capture those candid moments without being intrusive. The result? A stunning collection of photos that genuinely reflect our personalities and the joy of the day. Quick Turnaround: One of the most impressive aspects was how quickly we received our photos. We were expecting to wait weeks, but Ryan had our beautifully edited images ready shortly after the wedding. It was a delightful surprise that allowed us to relive our special moments almost immediately! Great Communication: Leading up to the wedding, Ryan was incredibly communicative and organized. He took the time to understand our vision and preferences, which made the entire process smooth and stress-free. Any questions or concerns we had were always promptly addressed. Overall, we are so grateful to have had Ryan Michaels Photography capture our wedding. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for a fun, professional, and talented photographer.

We tied the knot in November 2023 at the Brazilian Room in Berkeley, CA, and our journey with Ryan Michaels Photography and Moha Nad Films began at a wedding fair. Our quest for a ...

duo offering both photo and video services led us to Ryan and Moha Nad, who have been a dynamic team for many years. They presented an enticing bundle package for booking both services together and offered us an additional unique "Love Story" package, which served as our engagement shoot. During our Love Story shoot, we spent quality time with Ryan and Moha Nad exploring beautiful locations. Ryan expertly captured stunning photos that we used for our save-the-dates, wedding website, and a custom-printed album that we used as a guestbook at our wedding. Meanwhile, Moha Nad filmed the moments and created a short cinematic video that played during our reception dinner. Opting not to view it beforehand, the surprise factor made it even more beautiful and special. Working with Ryan and Moha Nad was not only professional but also incredibly fun and easy. Despite initial nerves in front of the camera, they provided excellent direction, making us feel at ease throughout the process. A unique touch was getting Ryan and Moha Nad to join us on the dance floor along with their assistants – an unforgettable moment that elevated our connection beyond a client-vendor relationship. Their genuine enthusiasm and personalized approach made our wedding day even more memorable. While we eagerly await our wedding photos and video, based on our Love Story results, we have full confidence that the final product will be nothing short of stunning. We wholeheartedly recommend Ryan Michaels Photography and Moha Nad Films to anyone seeking exceptional photography and videography services. Attached are some glimpses from our Love Story shoot, showcasing the talent and creativity of this incredible duo.

Ryan was absolutely amazing. We had never had professional photos done and were nervous that we would look awkward and posed. We met Ryan for our engagement photos and we went fr...

om feeling awkward to comfortable very shortly. Ryan not only has an eye for photography but also is great with people. Our wedding day. Best decision ever using Ryan. I was very nervous to be in front of so many people sharing such a personal and intimate moment in our lives. Ryan and his wife took my mind off it all and put my anxiety at ease just talking to me and teaching me how to stand and hold my body to take the best possibly pictures throughout the day. Honestly I did not see them throughout the ceremony as there was so much to take in. After we took our photos on the property with me and my husband, kids and family we went to leave and I realized I needed my dress bustled and no one to help. My husband had a blank look on his face not knowing what to do. Ryan heard this and quickly said I heard bustle she needs help and they jumped out of their car and started bustling my dress. Ryan and his wife playfully engaged competing to bustle my dress and were absolute life savers. At the reception Ryan checked in to see if there were specific pictures we wanted to take or people to capture and checked in prior to leaving. We are honestly soooo very excited to see the pictures from our ceremony and reception. Without a doubt Ryan is amazing and for the price seems unreal. Ryan’s concept and what he is doing makes wedding photos affordable and professional and in an so great full for him and his concept. I recommend Ryan for your engagement and wedding hands down. We thank you so much Ryan. Brooke & Andres

We received photos without watermarks and every photo he took with editing. The portal to share photos with friends and family was easy to use and convenient. We did have one issue with communication and timing of photo delivery. Ryan would give us a date for photos and then delay delivery by a week, doing this a couple of times. We eventually got photos after 2 months, which really is a reasonable amount of time, but we had been told it would take less time than it did. Overall, we received high quality and beautiful photos for a great price!

From the first time I spoke with Ryan on the phone, I knew he was going to be the perfect match for our day. We had fun all day and laughed a lot during our getting ready pictures....

He is incredibly friendly and personable. Not to mention how amazing our pictures turned out! I got butterflies all over again looking at them. He perfectly captured my husband and I, our families, and the day! I highly recommend working with Ryan! There couldn’t possibly be an easier choice when it comes to the hundreds you are making when planning your wedding! If I had to do it all over again, I would pick Ryan without any hesitation!

e wanted and thanks to him, he made it possible! Ryan was very professional, and funny all our guests loved him. He planned out our day and kept us on schedule which was extremely helpful. His prices are very affordable especially after you see the quality of work he does is far greater than he charges. He offers flexible packages and really just wants to help your event whatever it may be go as seamless, trouble free and enjoyable as possible. Thanks Ryan for being there to capture such precious moments in our lives!
