When you're headed to a big event like a wedding, you may want to branch out from your usual go-to style or blowout and consider formal hairstyles instead. This is especially true if you're following a formal or black-tie dress code—after all, your hair impacts your entire look, and you want it to match the vibe you're going for. Unlike more relaxed styles (like beach waves), a formal hairstyle tends to be about clean, sleek lines and an overall sophisticated vibe. They can be ideal for a bride, a member of the wedding party or a guest dressing to impress.

  * Tips for Choosing Formal Hairstyles
  * Formal Hairstyles for Every Hair Type



## Tips for Choosing Formal Hairstyles

[Choosing a hairstyle](https://www.theknot.com/content/choosing-a-wedding-day-hairstyle) for a formal event means taking a few things into consideration—most importantly, the length and type of hair you have. A style that looks beautiful on long hair may not work for shorter locks, and vice versa. 

There are two other things to keep in mind as well: the neckline of your dress and the time of year. You want a hairstyle that complements your dress rather than overshadows or takes away from it. "I feel the lower the neckline, the longer the hair needs to be, and the higher the neckline, the more up on your head the hairstyle needs to be," says [William Whatley](https://www.williamwhatley.com/), celebrity hairstylist and creative education director for [Scruples](https://scrupleshaircare.com/). As for weather, higher temperatures usually mean an [updo](https://www.theknot.com/content/updos-for-long-hair) is going to be more comfortable. 

FEATURED VIDEO FROM THE KNOT

Brides also need to consider their veil (if they're wearing one). This can definitely impact how your hairstyle looks, so Whatley recommends bringing it to any trial appointment you have booked. And when you choose a formal hairstyle, he strongly recommends doing a trial with that exact look to make sure it's what you want. 

### Formal Hairstyles for Long Hair

Long hair means you have a lot of flexibility and options when it comes to finding a formal hairstyle you love. You can choose an impressive updo or a sleek blowout, as just about anything will work with this length. 

If you want to keep your hair down but don't want just any blowout, Hollywood waves are an elegant choice, according to Hanna Oh, Chicago-based celebrity hairstylist and owner of [821 West](https://www.821west.com/). "When achieving Hollywood waves, the curls have to be much smaller than you think, so it causes the hair to shrink a lot," she explains. "Starting off with enough length is crucial to execute the perfect Hollywood wave." 

Whatley says one of his go-to looks is a low French bun placed just at the base of the neck using a center part or a side part. "This creates a very elegant and sophisticated look, especially for a more traditional wedding theme," he says. 

### Formal Hairstyles for Medium Hair

Medium-length hair also means you have plenty of different options to choose from. To keep hair off your shoulders, both Oh and Whatley love the idea of a low updo or low bun. Whatley notes that a low bun really allows a bride to emphasize her veil, so this could be a great choice if you want to make sure everyone is looking at yours. It's also fairly low-maintenance and very versatile. 

Another option is a formal ponytail hairstyle. "It's the perfect effortless wedding day [style for medium-length hair](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-hairstyles-medium-hair)," Whatley says. "This is also great for brides with curly or wavy hair." And of course, leaving it down in a sleek blowout is another great choice, and something that Oh refers to as "effortless and natural." 

### Formal Hairstyles for Short Hair

Depending on how short your short hair is, an updo can be a little tricky—but that doesn't mean your look has to be boring. "I love curling and leaving short hair down," Oh says. "Pinning one side up is always a great way to open up the hair and create instant glamour." 

A tousled updo may also work. Whatley recommends adding some curls to the hair, then pulling it back and pinning it. "This helps open up the face and accents your eyes and cheeks," he says. Just be careful with complicated updos. "Don't use a ton of extensions to create longer hair," Whatley warns. "This creates so much effort trying to hide the extensions inside the hairstyle. Instead, I recommend selecting something that works with the length of your hair." 

### Formal Hairstyles for Curly Hair 

Both Oh and Whatley strongly recommend embracing your curls rather than fighting against them. "I love to put the curls in perfect place with no frizz, just super shiny, bouncy curls," Whatley says. "Then do a side part, pull back one side, and add a delicate accessory, allowing the curls to be your accent piece for the day." 

Adding some height is great for a formal curly hairstyle too. Oh recommends a French twist or similar updo, saying, "Curly hair holds all day so this is truly the best option for any type of updo." A low chignon can also be an elegant look. 

## Formal Hairstyles for Every Hair Type

With so many different hairstyles to choose from, it can feel hard to settle on just one. Take a look at some gorgeous options on real brides and wedding guests—there's something for every [hair type](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-hair-type-tips) and length. 

### Find your kind of venue

From barns to ballrooms, discover reception venues that feel like you.

### 1\. Low, Braided Bun 

![Low braided bun formal wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/e1521f1b-83ec-4c2e-b8c4-d1984fabf0cd~rs_768.h-cr_0.180.1080.1620)

Ideal for long or medium-length hair, this slicked back low bun lets your outfit be the main focus of your look. It's elegant and classic but adds just enough texture to make it feel a bit more fun and modern. This [braid hairstyle](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-hairstyles-for-long-hair-with-braids) is also great for warm temperatures and a dress with a lower neckline. 

### 2\. Half Cornrows 

![Half cornrows formal wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/9d132d75-825c-48ee-b8eb-5cdb960380ea~rs_768.h-cr_0.55.1080.1495)

_Photo: Apollo Fotografie {Fine Art Wedding + Photo}_

While this is shown on someone with long hair, this can easily work with any hair length. Make a middle part, then add some thin cornrows to one side and leave the other side down. This is unique and cool, and would look great with a less traditional outfit or vibe. 

### 3\. Short Side Part

![Short side part formal wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/596c13c6-ce2b-4761-85a9-c0e693be5dbe~rs_768.h-cr_0.90.1080.1530)

Perfect for a spunky pixie cut, this hairstyle is simple and super easy: It consists of only a side part. You can add a little bit of texture or prevent frizz with some added product, and adding a little volume may also be a good idea. Otherwise, this is an easy formal hairstyle that works for something that feels formal but also laid back. 

### 4\. Half Up With Soft Curls

![Half-up formal wedding hairstyle with soft curls](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/8813e4b9-1ee3-467d-97a4-9bd20169efdb~rs_768.h-cr_241.423.1941.2690)

_Photo: RTFaith Photography,__Beauty: Off White Makeup and Beauty_

A half-up/half-down hairstyle is a classic, and the soft curls with this one make it feel extra romantic. This is a beautiful bridal style with a dress that has a strapless or low neckline. Leave some tendrils out in front to make it feel even more soft and relaxed. 

### 5\. Voluminous Low Bun 

![Voluminous low bun formal wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/746ff03a-1e2a-4297-ae0a-146d94dc3a24~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1600.2133)

_Photo: Pat Furey Photography_

This low bun, which sits a bit higher up than the nape of the neck than other similar styles, keeps your hair off your shoulders and would look great with any neckline. Add some volume at the top to keep it from being too slicked back, and leave some tendrils out in front for an extra romantic look. 

### 6\. Slicked Back Pixie 

![Slicked back pixie formal wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/e8ef16ae-ab0a-4f95-abec-e7d989c1174b~rs_768.h-cr_164.161.1848.2407)

_Photo: Jasmine Ruiz_

Super short haircuts, like this pixie cut, look put together and elegant when slicked back a bit. This short formal hairstyle has the hair brushed back and held in place with gel, so while there's still some volume there, it will also hold in place throughout the night, whether you're dancing or in humid weather. It's easy, minimal and looks great with any outfit. 

### 7\. Long, Soft Curls

![Long, soft curls formal wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/ed40620a-c59a-4ab9-94be-9be398951e28~rs_768.h-cr_237.446.1918.2687)

If you don't want to do an updo, it's hard to go wrong with a half-up/half-down look with soft curls. This is a go-to formal hairstyle for a reason: It's romantic, feminine and works for any season. For a softer look that isn't trying too hard, keep the curls brushed out a bit and leave out some face-framing tendrils. 

### 8\. Purposefully Messy Bun

![Purposefully messy bun formal wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/72d33435-3348-4a5f-a23a-104212ba59c3~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1224.1632)

_Photo: Sarah Lord Photo,__Beauty: Ashley McNabb Artistry_

A [bun hairstyle](https://www.theknot.com/content/bun-hairstyles-for-wedding) is a go-to choice when looking for something more formal. If slicked back and tight isn't your thing, this voluminous, purposefully messy bun may work better. This has a more easygoing, thrown-together look, but it still appears chic and worthy of any special occasion. Opt for this hairstyle if you don't want to stress over your hair throughout the night or want to really show off your dress. 

### 9\. Tight, Short Curls

![Tight, short curls formal wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/a1f0d199-6133-44ad-8dab-3365c953eac9~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1224.1632)

_Photo: Ruet Photo,__Beauty: Hannah Zahner Beauty_

Fully embrace your curls on your wedding day or at your next big event with this simple hairstyle, which works with any hair length. Use some sort of curling gel or cream to create the look of tight curls and then leave your hair as is. The only time this might not work is if the weather is very humid, since that could lead to a lot of frizz. Otherwise this is a pretty simple and versatile style that would look beautiful with or without a hair accessory. 

### 10\. Half-Up/Half-Down with Waves 

![Half-up half-down formal wedding hairstyle with waves](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/74750cd7-b32a-4a26-a074-1dcbc66846ab~rs_768.h-cr_195.54.1968.2418)

This beautiful style is an easy way to make beach waves—which tend to feel casual—a little more formal: Slick back the top of the hair into a tight half-up/half-down look, and then leave the rest in soft, shiny waves. This is a beautiful [hairstyle for an open-back dress](https://www.theknot.com/content/hairstyles-for-open-back-dresses), especially if you have longer hair, and works with other low-cut necklines as well. 

### 11\. Sleek Middle Part Style

![Sleek middle part formal wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/843825df-724e-4d23-b55a-0adafe84703d~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1224.1632)

_Photo: Robert Aveau for Bonnie Sen Photography,__Beauty: CMF Artistry LLC_

Classic and sophisticated, this sleek middle part style elevates a blowout and looks a bit more formal. Part hair down the middle, then use product to keep the front slicked down a bit, making it appear tucked behind the ears. Some volume at the crown of the head and very loose waves make this even prettier. If you're celebrating an Indian wedding, a traditional maang tikka accessory completes the look. 

### 12\. Simple Curls 

![Simple curls formal wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/c58a8fa4-3c3c-4650-a9dc-d73f91eecc30~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1224.1632)

_Photo: Rachel Elaine Photography,__Beauty: Stephanie Nelson Makeup & Hair_

To keep things a bit more simple, opt for a blowout with some added volume and curls. This is a great formal hairstyle for medium-length hair and looks lovely with almost any neckline (unless it's a very high neck). You can add some tighter curls if you'd like, and some volume at the roots with a slight side part makes it more interesting.

### 13\. Textured Low Half-Up Style

![Textured low half-up formal wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/fdc0f84b-716b-4342-8f9d-df33e9325e12~rs_768.h-cr_0.41.1224.1673)

_Photo: Robert Carlo New York,__Beauty: Salon Social Hair_

This low [half-up hairstyle](https://www.theknot.com/content/half-up-hairstyles-for-long-hair) is effortlessly gorgeous. Softly pull back some of your hair, leaving it a bit tousled for a more romantic vibe. Brushed out waves or curls add some texture without coming across as too styled, and adding a little volume and some face-framing tendrils completes the look. This would be beautiful with an off-the-shoulder or strapless gown in the spring or fall. 

### 14\. Slicked Back Voluminous Ponytail

![Slicked back voluminous ponytail formal wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/b5729805-4dc6-4710-87eb-fe449412750e~rs_768.h-cr_0.41.1224.1673)

_Photo: Nikki Daskalakis,__Beauty: Glamour by Troi_

This dramatic low ponytail is perfect for a bride who wants to make a statement with her hair—it will also have the most impact with longer lengths. Use gel to slick your hair back into a tight low ponytail with a middle part, and then go a little wild with the volume. Opt for lots of curls, texture and teasing to create a huge ponytail that stands out. This will look best with a backless or low-back dress. 

### 15\. Soft Wavy Blowout

![Soft wavy blowout formal wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/9e9bf755-f84c-488b-8304-24fbf2d98c4d~rs_768.h-cr_0.82.1224.1714)

_Photo: Molly Lichten Photography,__Beauty: Kelly Zhang_

This versatile blowout works whether you're a bride, bridesmaid or wedding guest. This look is a bit more textured and laid back rather than super formal, but it still works for a very special event. Add some texture to the hair with brushed out, very loose waves, and go for the side part to create a softer look. 

### 16\. Voluminous Bun With Trendrils

![Voluminous bun with tendrils formal wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/6cfdbad8-70ec-4680-aeda-4ef6fe7f384c~rs_768.h-cr_0.89.1067.1512)

_Photo: MC Weddings,__Beauty: Cabo Makeup_

If you want to get long hair off your shoulders, try this voluminous bun. The hair sits piled in a bun towards the top of the head, with plenty of volume and loose edges for something that doesn't feel too sleek. Leave a chunk of hair out in the front and give it a soft curl for a bit of an Old Hollywood vibe. 

### 17\. Soft Curls and a Sparkling Clip

![Soft curls and sparkling clip formal wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/73e1875a-546b-4f53-92fc-ca50c9b48f1b~rs_768.h-cr_0.82.1224.1714)

_Photo: Mandee Johnson Photography,__Beauty: Amy Sparks Makeup and Hair_

Soft curls with a deep side part create a hairstyle that is both glamorous and romantic, with a bit of a vintage vibe. You can take that one step further by adding a glittering hair accessory right above the ear. This makes the look feel even more special and formal. You can choose a hair clip that works with some element of your outfit. 

### 18\. Updo With Locs

![Braided updo formal wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/77fa87ae-0e94-4b34-bd8e-1de611d3ae72~rs_768.h-cr_0.82.1224.1714)

_Photo: Julia K Photography,__Beauty: Beauty Livery_

These brides are examples of two ways you can wear your locs on your wedding day. Put your hair in a tousled and messy high bun, or a more sleek look with a French twist updo. 

### 19\. Half-Up/Half-Down with Volume

![Half-up half-down formal wedding hairstyle with volume](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/58da28c7-5213-463e-aec0-ee7ba39e2845~rs_768.h-cr_0.181.1064.1600)

_Photo: Jen Yuson Photography,__Beauty: Christine Storey Smith Hair and Makeup_

Opt for a more romantic vibe with this half-up formal hairstyle. Pull hair loosely back into place, keeping plenty of volume and texture at the top. This look is perfect with a long, statement-making veil and longer locks. You can also add a hair accessory to keep some sort of embellishment once the veil is off for the night. 

### 20\. Long Curls and a Statement-Making Clip

![Long curls and statement clip formal wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/471cbc67-9e11-4b7a-ac8a-32d4a065e49b~rs_768.h-cr_0.66.854.1205)

_Photo: JAO Photography,__Beauty: Dolled By Nueye_

Anyone with long or medium-length hair can opt for a classic and sophisticated vibe with long, glamorous curls. A sleek middle or side part is a nice contrast, and you can also add a large (or small) hair accessory by your ear to make the whole look feel even more formal and special. 

### 21\. Soft Bun with Flowers

![Soft bun with flowers formal wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/66753520-c886-4454-8601-dce8c1184f27~rs_768.h-cr_3.334.1902.2866)

_Photo: Ivy Weddings,__Beauty: Ms. Painted Lady_

Simple and always stunning, a bun that sits lower on the back of your head works well with long or medium-length hair. You can add a little texture and volume to the top to keep it softer and more romantic. And in lieu of a hair clip, tuck some fresh (or faux) flowers around the bun for something feminine and perfect for a spring or summer affair. 

### 22\. Glamorous Waves with a Middle Part

![Glamorous waves with middle part formal wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/c036e0aa-0f6e-41c2-a652-75de4a1cec2d~rs_768.h-cr_0.19.1224.1651)

_Photo: Gabby Gonzalez Fotografia_

Polished, elegant and romantic, this hairstyle works great with long or medium-length hair and is versatile enough to pair with most looks and seasons. Opt for glamorous, vintage style waves, and make the style more modern with a sleek middle part. A little volume at the crown of the head makes this even prettier, and it looks great with or without a veil. 

### 23\. Statement Headband with a Bob

![Statement headband with bob formal wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/bd86eff8-a7a5-41e9-a6c2-a287fdcf78e7~rs_768.h-cr_161.527.1888.2830)

_Photo: Jes Workman_

A bob with bangs is such a pretty haircut that you really don't need to do much to make it feel special. You can keep things simpler by finding a hair accessory you love—for example, a statement headband is perfect for an easy formal look. Something like this pearl headband instantly elevates your hair and looks great in photos. 

### 24\. Tight, Tousled Bun

![Tight tousled bun formal wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/ab834449-d1c4-44db-9e27-69c15e4246d4~rs_768.h-cr_0.80.1224.1712)

_Photo: Divine Day Photography_

Evoke '90s style with this fun look. Create a slicked back look by pulling hair tight into a bun towards the top of the head, and then have fun with the actual bun: It can be tousled, a little messy and piecey. Leave a few tendrils out in the front to complete the look. This would work best with long or medium-length hair and would look great with a spaghetti strap dress. 

### 25\. Long Curls with a Middle Part

![Long curls with middle part formal wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/fc9d39b8-49fc-43e5-a7f9-bd5d61febc49~rs_768.h-cr_0.66.1064.1485)

_Photo: Elizabeth Fogarty,__Beauty: Tress Art Hair_

Opt for classic simplicity with this hairstyle. It consists of a middle part for a modern touch, with long curls for something romantic and classic. This style is great for long or medium-length hair and it's fairly low-maintenance. However, keep in mind that it would probably be best in cooler climates or seasons—too much heat and humidity, and this could get frizzy fast. 

### 26\. Tousled French Twist

![Tousled French twist formal wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/b3c59dd3-7c20-4e68-9b8d-2523e6330d61~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1224.1632)

A French twist is such an elegant and classic hairstyle. It's a bit more elevated than a bun, and you can have fun with it. Instead of a traditional French twist, opt for something a little more tousled and messy. This creates a softer look, especially with some tendrils out around your face. This is also a great way to show off a pair of huge, statement earrings. 

### 27\. Half-Up Style with Accessories

![Half-up formal hairstyle with accessories](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/024b1bf1-9ca6-45b4-b791-30439c31dc8d~rs_768.h-cr_0.41.1224.1673)

Another beautiful way to incorporate a traditional Indian maang tikka is to add it to a romantic half-up/half-down hairstyle. This style features long, soft waves with a slightly mussed up look. It's great with long or medium-length hair and the hair accessory down the middle part makes it even more special. 

### 28\. Sleek Low Bun

![Sleek low bun formal wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/da9c3ab8-ccdb-446d-a2ce-76503c7652c8~rs_768.h-cr_0.82.1224.1714)

There is something so graceful and refined about a sleek low bun like this one. With a middle part and sides that are slicked down, this plays into [2025 hair trends](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-hair-trends) without feeling like it's _too_ trendy. The low bun is a beautiful choice with a higher neckline as well, and you can achieve this look with medium-length hair that is on the shorter side. 

### 29\. Big High Bun

![Big high bun formal wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/d327e1b4-3aed-4ad8-b027-a82bb70aceb2~rs_768.h-cr_176.470.1937.2817)

A high bun doesn't need to be a tight, perfectly round ball on top of your head—take it from this style, which incorporates long hair into a huge, voluminous bun that gives off an almost retro vibe. Opt for a middle part and leave some front pieces out around the face for a softer look. 

### 30\. Short Curls

![Short curls  formal wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/1c9424fe-a063-4747-9db5-f2b7c35c3873~rs_768.h-cr_0.34.1067.1457)

Embrace the texture of your natural hair even with a [short hairstyle](https://www.theknot.com/content/short-wedding-hair-with-veil). This pixie cut with curls is so pretty and such a simple look—it's versatile enough to go with most gowns and makes a nice contrast to something very formal. You can add a hair accessory if you want to elevate the look a bit more, but with the right product, this can be beautiful on its own. 

### 31\. Low Bun and Statement Hair Accessory

![Low bun and statement accessory formal wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/ee29e80f-bf72-4cd6-920b-56267aff03ff~rs_768.h-cr_0.82.1224.1714)

Pull long hair back into a low bun that sits at the nape of the neck, and make it big, voluminous and beautiful. The slicked back hair at the crown of your head contrasts nicely with a large bun, and you can opt for a side or middle part. To make sure everyone remembers this hairstyle, add a large, statement-making accessory, like this glittering hair clip that adds some texture to an otherwise minimalist gown. 

### 32\. Retro Half-Up Style

![Retro half-up formal wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/5e59ef78-91ca-4578-9aa6-7d4808e78a13~rs_768.h-cr_0.89.1067.1512)

With flipped up ends and a pouf at the crown of the head, this half-up style is given a retro transformation. This formal hairstyle is beautiful with a classic dress or something fairly simple, and works well with a strapless or off-the-shoulder neckline. It also looks pretty with or without a veil. 

### 33\. High Curly Updo

![High curly updo formal wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/75a5ec4f-97a6-4022-9f3e-b1bca7544061~rs_768.h-cr_0.83.1000.1416)

You can opt for a [curly hairstyle](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-hairstyles-for-curly-hair) that feels plucked from the early 2000s, which is fun and on trend. Starting with a middle part, pull hair back into a tight updo. Curl your hair, then arrange it into an updo, like a messy bun or ponytail, making it high and leaving some front pieces out to frame your face. 

### 34\. Hollywood Glamour Waves

![Hollywood glamour waves formal wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/517f008d-6e82-4580-a278-c363c4942909~rs_768.h-cr_0.93.1000.1426)

If you have long hair, it's hard to go wrong with Old Hollywood glamour. These soft, brushed out curls have a vintage vibe and look glamorous and gorgeous every single time. A side part really completes the look, and if you're the bride, a sparkling hair accessory gives it a little something extra. 

### 35\. Twisted Low Bun

![Twisted low bun formal wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/f7066cf2-8317-4853-a143-8f27b2b9734f~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1000.1333)

A low bun works with almost any dress or season, and it's a great choice for both long and medium-length hair. This one feels a little different because some of the hair is twisted back to add texture and volume. Add a few face-framing tendrils and leave the look a bit mussed up to keep it romantic. 

### 36\. Simple Knotted Bun

![Simple knotted bun formal wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/663f6da3-1332-4f5f-80e9-1ca0240089c0~rs_768.h-cr_0.19.1000.1352)

Classically beautiful and elegant, this knotted bun style is simple, but definitely stands out. This is a gorgeous [hairstyle for a strapless dress](https://www.theknot.com/content/hairstyles-for-strapless-dresses) or off-the-shoulder neckline to show off a statement necklace, but it also works with a higher neckline. Keep the hair pulled back fairly tight but not slicked back, and knot the bun to keep it neat. 

### 37\. Short Natural Curls

![Short natural curls formal wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/a4a40674-99a3-436e-a08b-a0897dbc2c5c~rs_768.h-cr_0.82.1224.1714)

Instead of trying to play against your natural hair for a certain hairstyle, try embracing it. This style, which is super simple, shows how beautiful it can be: Just add some product to keep your natural curls looking photo-ready. Nothing else is needed with this gorgeous look, but you can add a hair accessory if you want. 

### 38\. Embellished Low Bun

![Embellished low bun formal wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/a9c41cd6-eaa7-4a83-ad9d-c797784a0ce1~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1000.1333)

A low, knotted bun is a classic look that can be very simple and minimalist. Adding a colorful or sparkly hair accessory is the easiest way to dress it up. A large hairpiece with bold colors or lots of embellishment is a perfect choice.
