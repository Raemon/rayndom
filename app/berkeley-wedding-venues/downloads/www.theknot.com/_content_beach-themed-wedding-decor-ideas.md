## Beach Wedding Ceremony Ideas

The wedding ceremony is just the beginning of your celebration, but it's also the moment when you officially become a married couple—so if you ask us, it deserves as much attention as the reception. Consider including these beach [ceremony decor ideas](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-ceremony-decoration-ideas) and other ways to personalize your vow exchange. 

### 1\. Greenery and Pampas Grass Beach Wedding Arch

![Beach wedding ceremony with upholstered chairs and greenery arch](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/a1141ebe-4bc1-48d7-a1b4-662e8c3d6351~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1080.810)

### 2\. Baskets and Fresh Fruit as Aisle Decorations

![Ceremony aisle decor with woven baskets and fresh fruit](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/d941b4f9-d0b1-486a-b9bf-90bfd18d8b47~rs_768.h-cr_81.0.1377.972)

_[Photo: Anna Delores Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/anna-delores-photography-santa-barbara-ca-589073),__[Event Planning: Vanessa Noel Events](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/coco-rose-design-summerland-ca-865798),__[Floral Design: Coco Rose Design](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/vanessa-noel-events-santa-barbara-ca-867594)_

For this ceremony overlooking the ocean, the couple decorated their aisle with woven seagrass baskets and a grouping of fresh fruit.

### 3\. Modern Ghost Chair Seating

![Waterfront wedding ceremony with ghost chairs and tropical leaf arch](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/d38d9ac7-9d7c-41de-b69c-1147a2aa96fd~rs_768.h-cr_18.0.1441.1067)

_[Photo: Christina McNeill Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/christina-mcneill-photography-san-francisco-ca-412441),__[Floral Design: Mandy Grace Designs](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/mandy-grace-designs-pukalani-hi-645343)_

Use clear ghost chairs for your ceremony to ensure nothing detracts from the epic altar and waterfront backdrop.

### 4\. Circular Backdrop with Loose Greenery

![Waterfront wedding ceremony with wood folding chairs and greenery full-circle arch](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/e9eb1855-35f4-419d-aa64-788172105476~rs_768.h-cr_0.17.1080.1457)

Leafy, oversized greenery gave this full-circle altar arch a relaxed, laid-back feel for the clifftop ceremony.

### 5\. Shoe Check Station

![Shelves for shoe check at beach wedding](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/27cc2658-40d0-456c-bf07-b6c89c97265a~rs_768.h-cr_0.121.1458.2065)

_[Photo: Valorie Darling Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/valorie-darling-photography-marina-del-rey-ca-893734)_

"While the concept of a beach wedding may sound purely romantic (and it definitely is!), the reality is also a bit more messy," says Shaktman. This beach wedding ceremony idea eliminates some of the mess by giving guests a spot to put their shoes and use brushes to dust off the sand.

### 6\. Mirrored Ceremony Flower Pedestals

![Beach ceremony with mirrored flower pedestals](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/0d1ff529-8eb3-4e26-a9d6-44493aa6528e~rs_768.h-cr_81.0.1377.972)

_[Photo: Emily Wren Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/emily-wren-photography-philadelphia-pa-595214),__[Floral Design: Tropic of Flowers](https://tropicofflowers.com)_

"When you think of a beach wedding, you usually think casual and tropical and that's the route most couples go," says Chang. "But, you can make a beach wedding fresh and unique by bringing in unexpected and contrasting elements." This modern-meets-tropical setup is worth a try if you're looking for beach wedding ideas with an edge—the mirrored floral pedestals are an unexpectedly cool touch. 

### 7\. Garden-Inspired Aisle Markers

![Beach wedding ceremony with white benches and rose aisle decorations ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/3b750e04-2306-4673-bd94-31671658bfcd~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1458.1944)

_[Photo: Lucy Munoz Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/lucy-munoz-photography-los-angeles-ca-768104),__[Floral Design: Elena Damy](https://elenadamy.com)_

Can't decide between the beach and an English-style garden? You can have both. Low-profile bundles of roses look beautiful in front of an ocean backdrop. 

### 8\. Folding Fans and Handkerchiefs

![Pink and black fans and handkerchiefs for beach wedding guests](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/ce830e90-c38a-4b39-addc-d5e6fea448a7~rs_768.h-cr_81.0.1377.972)

_[Photo: Emily Wren Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/emily-wren-photography-philadelphia-pa-595214),__[Stationery: Tropic of Flowers](https://tropicofflowers.com)_

To help guests beat the heat at this wedding in Mexico, folding fans and handkerchiefs were given to attendees upon arrival at the wedding ceremony.

### 9\. Wooden Ceremony Aisle Walkway

![Beach wedding ceremony with white folding chairs, wood walkway and romantic arch](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/78db54b3-95f2-49ba-93f0-614b1da19ab1~rs_768.h-cr_60.0.1020.720)

_[Photo: Brandon Kidd Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/brandon-kidd-photography-yorba-linda-ca-477873)_

Make it easier for your guests to walk through the sand by adding a temporary wooden walkway to the ceremony location. All-white decor fit right in with the white sand at this beachfront spot. 

### 10\. Steel Drum Music

![Steel drum music for the perfect beach wedding day](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/6e314c92-5e61-4872-97d7-bf4d47107b1b~rs_768.h-cr_0.155.1867.2644)

_Photo: Melissa Mowrey,__Music: Chuck Lawson_

Add some fun to your ceremony music with the help of this simple beach wedding idea. Instead of an acoustic guitarist or string quartet, hire a pro musician to play the steel drums for your processional. 

### 11\. Sand Unity Ceremony

![Have a sand unity ceremony at your beach wedding celebration](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/6dbe6bdc-1998-4c72-a792-9e4aafc2985f~rs_768.h-cr_0.250.3000.4250)

_[Photo: Theel Productions](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/theel-productions-kapolei-hi-2010838)_

What better place to incorporate a [sand unity ceremony](https://www.theknot.com/content/unique-unity-ceremony-ideas) than at the beach? You can use sand from the beach where you're getting married (as long as it's not prohibited) or use new sand from a craft supply store. 

## Beach Wedding Reception Ideas

Finding the right [beach wedding venue](https://www.theknot.com/content/beach-wedding-venues) is the first step in creating a memorable reception. (Our tip: You can browse and filter beach wedding venues by location, price and more on The Knot Vendor Marketplace.) Once you've done that, these beach-themed [wedding reception ideas](https://www.theknot.com/content/easy-ways-to-decorate-your-wedding-reception) will set the mood for a great party.

### 12\. All-White Lounge Furniture

![All-white lounge furniture and umbrellas on beach](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/b7452346-39cf-4754-a98a-b4ec909caca5~rs_768.h-cr_81.0.1377.972)

_[Photo: Brandon Kidd Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/brandon-kidd-photography-yorba-linda-ca-477873)_

Standalone chairs can be a little unstable on the sand, but larger furniture items won't tip over or sink as easily. Use chaise chairs, benches and patio umbrellas to create a lounge area where guests can relax away from the sun. 

### 13\. Piña Colada Signature Cocktails

![Pina coladas with orchid garnishes](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/afe4c369-0395-44b0-9e09-c97c4bf160d5~rs_768.h-cr_0.87.1080.1527)

_[Photo: Ashley Goodwin Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/ashley-goodwin-photography-honolulu-hi-762831)_

Frozen pina coladas, garnished with pineapple slices and orchid blooms, kept guests cool and hydrated at this wedding in Hawaii.

_[Photo: Mayad Studios](https://www.mayadstudios.com/)_

Lead your guests to the reception with a striking floral tunnel, like in the image above. We love the mix of flowers and fabric textures that created an oceanic, otherworldly moment. 

### 15\. Surfboard Guest Book

![Surfboard guest book with handwritten messages](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/64a5781f-b098-4508-9852-d718b286e1aa~rs_768.h-cr_0.23.1458.1967)

In keeping with the beach theme, ask your guests to write their well-wishes on a surfboard as a makeshift [wedding guest book](https://www.theknot.com/content/21-guest-books-that-make-great-keepsakes). 

### 16\. Mermaid Entertainers

![Mermaid entertainers on boat](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/1f2301bd-a182-4837-bbc9-e487b01db2e3~rs_768.h-cr_0.90.1080.1530)

Here's a beach wedding idea we're sure your guests haven't seen before. Mermaids entertained guests during a cocktail hour cruise around the harbor at this wedding.

### 17\. Coconut Shell Cocktails

![Waiter holding signature cocktail in fresh coconut](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/d4b88cdb-2ba3-4c4d-baed-6b169d19b142~rs_768.h-cr_0.122.1458.2066)

Why serve your drinks in regular glasses when you can use on-theme coconut shells instead? Look for options that can be personalized with your names or a decorative flower motif. 

### 18\. Wooden Deck with Lounge Area

![Boho lounge furniture on deck overlooking beach](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/e7fa5f8a-9153-484f-9cad-0338d5bfd8d9~rs_768.h-cr_81.0.1377.972)

_[Photo: Weddings by Nato](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/weddings-by-nato-brooklyn-ny-1010685),__[Event Planning: Hamptons Aristocrat](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/hamptons-aristocrat-bridgehampton-ny-979044),__[Rentals: Party Rental Ltd](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/party-rental-ltd-new-york-ny-2010512),__[Rentals: Patina Rentals](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/patina-rentals-brooklyn-ny-958077)_

When it comes to an outdoor venue, first think about what amenities a typical indoor venue would offer, and then make sure you incorporate them into your beach setting. Adding a hard floor to at least a portion of the space ensures that guests won't be stuck in the sand all night. 

### 19\. Neutral Decor with Dried Greenery

![Elegant beach reception with wishbone chairs, wood table and woven chandeliers](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/0f218827-3d3d-4476-a95b-b1fd2141ab9f~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1458.1944)

_[Photo: Lucy Munoz Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/lucy-munoz-photography-los-angeles-ca-768104),__[Event Design: Elena Damy](https://elenadamy.com)_

Wishbone chairs, modern wooden tables and a dramatic canopy with dried leaves and chandeliers set the stage for this trendy beachside reception.

### 20\. Reception with Bamboo Chairs and Woven Chandeliers

![Beach reception with wood tables, bamboo folding chairs and woven chandeliers](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/37396cdf-0474-43ec-95fe-3df64f3819d6~rs_768.h-cr_0.17.1080.1457)

Depending on the venue, you may need to get creative with your lighting fixtures after dark. Paper lanterns sprinkled among string lights creates a lively, playful vibe above your reception tables. 

## Beach Wedding Decoration Ideas

The waterfront view is the main event at any beach wedding venue, but you'll still need some decor to personalize the event. Get started with these beach wedding decor ideas we love. 

### 21\. Oyster Shell Escort Cards

![Calligraphed oyster shell escort cards](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/dd6adcbe-51a7-4a50-a2b6-bd92f4c833a2~rs_768.h-cr_0.122.1458.2066)

_[Photo: Cassi Claire Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/cassi-claire-photography-bridgewater-nj-536108)_

Calligraphed oyster shells or other seashells are a great option for directing guests to their seats. Plan far enough in advance to forage for shells on your next vacation or beach outing. 

### 22\. Monstera Leaf and Orchid Bloom Place Setting

![Tropical place setting with monstera leaf charger and orchid accents](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/73d9a180-a2f6-4a8c-8173-32272c7fac96~rs_768.h-cr_81.0.1377.972)

Woven chargers and monstera leaves brought a layered look to this tropical place setting.

### 23\. Marquee Letters

![Large marquee letters](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/8d24e8ea-428d-4967-892f-1735588ce018~rs_768.h-cr_6.0.1453.1085)

Welcome your guests to a Hawaiian wedding reception by using oversized marquee letters to spell 'aloha' or another greeting message. 

### 24\. Driftwood Escort Cards

![driftwood escort cards for the best beach wedding decor](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/2b14b572-2e71-4e4b-b183-d658bf189f9e~rs_768.h-cr_0.220.2640.3740)

Don't leave your guests stranded—guide them to their seats using pieces of driftwood inscribed with their names and table assignments. 

### 25\. Tropical Tablescape

![tropical tablesetting](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/1d7fa046-1033-4831-becc-aeab1aa818c0~rs_768.h-cr_0.28.1080.1468)

_[Photo: Daniel Colvin Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/daniel-colvin-photography-houston-tx-866027)_

If your beach wedding leans tropical, go full-on with super vibrant place settings, shimmering tableware and tropical bird decor. 

### 26\. Rattan Lamps and Bistro Lights

![Wedding reception with wood structure for woven chandeliers](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/cb1df87f-8910-4c86-a362-a49e89b53ec3~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1080.1440)

_[Photo: Ken Tan Photo](https://www.kentanphoto.com),__[Floral Design: I Am Flower](https://www.iamflower.co)_

"There are so many beautiful touches you can add to a beach wedding to make sure it is fresh and unique," says Shaktman. "Consider aesthetic and functional lighting features by installing beautiful twinkle lights over the dining and dancing area that melt right into the stars in the sky. Add fun glowing orbs or fairy lights on the beach that light up down to the shore as the sun sets." 

### 27\. Poolside Wedding Reception

![Glam beach reception with black bentwood chairs and gold table](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/22561ed2-5419-48c8-9650-10f8cd1b7729~rs_768.h-cr_81.0.1377.972)

If your reception takes place away from the beach itself, you can get a little more ambitious with your table settings. Black bentwood chairs and a gold-and-black table ensured this wedding reception was positively fresh and modern.

### 34\. Anchor-Shaped Cookies

![anchor sugar cookies for your beach wedding celebration](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/5fbceb63-4d87-49c6-aaeb-1c70b0624d29~rs_768.h-cr_0.115.1328.1886)

_[Photo: Jess Lance Photo](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/jesslancephoto-griswold-ct-592916)_

## Editor's Beach Wedding Favorites

Other than the decor, flowers and cake, here are just a few other details we'd include for a beach-themed wedding. 

### 54\. Ethereal Beach Wedding Dress

![Couple holding hands and walking on beach at sunset](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/4b704004-ea05-4c8e-9c97-200f010900a2~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1458.1944)

With potential warm temperatures and humidity, you'll want a [beach wedding dress](https://www.theknot.com/content/beach-wedding-dresses) that's comfortable and breathable. Airy fabrics like chiffon and organza are much lighter than lace or silk, and bonus: they look so pretty blowing in an ocean breeze. 

### 55\. Ice Cream Food Truck

![Ice Cream Food Truck](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/b5228480-a701-41a3-8f85-147bbfa212f7~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1079.1439)

### 59\. Colorful Block Heel Sandals

![Yellow, tan and green summery block heels](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/601b1493-3a64-4872-9df2-6e57d6a2cdc4~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1458.1944)

### 61\. Wicker Fans

![Wicker Fans on ceremony chairs](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/bc46020b-56ec-49f1-bb1e-43edd5ccfa40~rs_768.h-cr_1.0.1458.1942)
