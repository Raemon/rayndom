o work with through the planning process. We enjoyed getting to meet both him and his wife during a tasting, and learning about their start. They offered a ton of valuable advice during the planning process, and most importantly, their menu options were all really delicious. We created our menu from their comprehensive list of options and courses. We received so many compliments about how delicious and wholesome the menu turned out, and how fun it was that we chose a “family style” dinner service. The team did a wonderful job of service, making our guests and us feel special, on a special day. It was also super helpful to work with a vendor that offers a full suite of event rentals, in addition to great catering. The wedding venue looked stunning, in no small part to the Pacific Connections team, who provided seating, table, placesetting, and linen services in addition to food. Thank you Rob!

Pacific Connection catered our wedding this past May and the food was DELICIOUS! We first found them because my friend used them at her wedding and it was the best wedding food we ...

had ever had. So when it came time to plan our wedding, we remembered how good the food was and asked who she used. Every item on the menu was incredible and unique and all of our guests told us it was not only the best wedding food they had ever had but better than many restaurants too. Would choose them again and again!

The service on the day of the wedding was impeccable. From the cocktail hour to the dinner and the bar, every detail was seamless, and the staff went above and beyond to ensure our guests were well taken care of. Pacific Connection Catering helped make our wedding truly unforgettable, and we wouldn’t have chosen anyone else. We would highly recommend them if you are looking for a great caterer in the North Bay.

If you want people to rave about the food at your wedding, HIRE PACIFIC CONNECTION!! Not only did nearly every single person rave about the food, but the staff was amazingly nice...

& accommodating (they don't hire out, which we loved)! Rob has amazing insight into what works, and ideas to help you create the perfect day. I also highly recommend the family style dinner, 150 people were done eating in 1 hour & everyone got plenty of exactly what they wanted! I would hire them 10x over.

My husband and I are so thankful that we went with Pacific Connection Catering!! Rob and his team were so amazing to work with and the food was EXCELLENT at our wedding. Our guest...

s were reminiscing about how good even the salad was after our wedding—can you imagine, the salad?!? But I fully agree. Rob is super personable and had some great advice about what food to select, where to position everything, and how to make everything operate as smoothly as possible. He let us know to anticipate that things would change up to the wedding date, and he was right. Luckily, he and his team are super-duper prepared and took everything in stride. One of the things that I really appreciated was that Pacific Connection was very mindful about various dietary restrictions that we had at our wedding. The chef made two guests’ meals nut-free due to major allergies and they helped us craft a mostly pescatarian menu, as both the groom and I are pescatarian. I think that special touches really set Pacific Connection apart from other catering companies. For example, we had an intimate tasting with my fiance’s parents to decide on the final menu. It was one of the best parts about prepping for the wedding! Rob and his wife walked us through the menu and we could make changes as we went. The day of the wedding, Pacific Connection staff had a platter of hor d’oeuvres ready for the groom and I once we were FINALLY done with pictures. Shout out to the falafel sliders! The dinner to follow tasted delicious and was perfectly timed—we loved how well the family style worked. All of the servers were so nice, attentive, flexible, and professional. In sum, I cannot recommend Pacific Connection Catering enough!!

Pacific connection review From the beginning, Rob was amazing to work with. He is super responsive via email. Even if he is waiting for information to get you an answer, he will r...

eply letting you know he got your email and will get back to you. We had an email chain of well over 100 emails and he was so thorough and helpful. I had to push my wedding out a year due to covid and he was super understanding and changed the date with no issues. I asked him so many questions about etiquette, counts for drinks, the floor plan, rentals and more. He always answered very clearly and thoroughly. He was very patient and never made me feel like I was bothering him. He was definitely the most organized out of all of my vendors. He even helped me with the timeline and gave great guidance. Rob also met me on-site for my first venue walk through and was great at giving suggestions for the floor plan. I love that he didn’t try to upsell me a bunch of stuff. He even ordered all of our rentals through the rental company and didn’t upcharge us at all. He said he just wants to make sure everything is correct and perfect so he doesn’t mind taking care of the rentals. The food at the tasting and reception was out of this world good. They have an extensive menu and it was so hard to choose just a few options. We ended up doing a family style menu so my guests got to taste everything. All night guests kept coming up to me and telling me how good the food was. Some of the items they raved about were the tri tip Asado, mashed potatoes, chicken and waffles, ahi tuna cone, and the salad with the pickled onions. The staff were super professional and friendly too. Hire Rob and his team. You will not regret it!

We loved working with Rob and his team. From the start, Rob was very involved and helped us not only with figuring out the catering, he also helped provide some tips on our day-of ...

wedding schedule. We chose Pacific Connection not only for the delicious food, but also for the professionalism and how easy it was to work with Rob's team. Rob was there with us for a walkthrough of the venue before our wedding, which really showed his commitment to making sure everything would run smoothly. His staff were also amazing – they kept our drinks refilled and were hospitable the entire time. Would definitely recommend Pacific Connection!

on to see how well these two worked together. Rob has a keen eye for detail, is incredibly organized, and was very quick to respond to all of our emails and phone calls. Early on in our wedding planning, we didn’t have a planner. We got married at The Secret Gardens at Bodega Bay, and luckily for us, Rob and his team have worked at the venue dozens of times. He knew the layout and flow of the venue and had a lot of great suggestions for how to set everything up. We did a walk through of the venue with Rob and he helped us plan where our welcome table, sweets table, photo booth, sweetheart table etc. would go. He even went as far as printing out a sketch of the venue with all of the table placements we discussed to help with our planning. The food is AMAZING! Donna is a fantastic chef. There are only a few things people remember at a wedding and the food definitely tops the list. Pacific Connections was the first caterer we met with, and after the first food tasting we didn’t even bother scheduling any others — we knew we had to have them at our wedding! We chose to do family style over buffet to avoid people having to get up from their seats. Rob and his team were able to serve a flight to the entire room of 125 people in under 3 minutes. We were very impressed with the speed, accuracy, and timing of the food. We had three separate flights and each flight was evenly spaced so people weren’t waiting around hungry or getting too much food placed in front of them. Overall, we had an amazing experience with the Pacific Connections team. They helped make our wedding memorable, and we received a lot of compliments on the food (from meat eaters, vegans, and children). We would highly recommend them to anyone in the market for a catering team.

About a year before our August 2018 wedding, my husband reached out to several caterers in the Napa area. We had a kinda daunting task: a backyard wedding with ~80 people, organize...

d from the other side of the country (we're in DC but were getting married in Napa). Pacific Connection gave us a good price and good vibes from the get go, so we decided to go with them. And what a great decision! I think the two things that really made working with Pacific Connection great were: Rob's responsiveness and confidence (he and his team do this a LOT, and their knowledge/advice/experience was always so reassuring and helpful) and the actual quality of the food! We got so many compliments from people about how tasty everything was. If you're doing a summer wedding, we would really recommend the summer ceviche salad - I am STILL thinking about that thing, yummm! Rob was always a great and helpful point of contact for us; he was incredibly responsive and professional, and kept better track of our ideas than we did (!). The whole team was also super flexible and helpful in working with our venue: a backyard space in a private house that was undergoing some renovation/construction literally hours before the event started (heh). When Rob and his team did an on-site visit about ~8 months prior to the event, he sketched out a plan for how to organize the ceremony, cocktail hour, dinner and dancing. He also helped us with rentals (tables, dance floor, etc). We really depended on his plan as the core of our wedding planning. Rob kept the whole event moving smoothly and it was just great! Our day ended up being completely stress-free (!) and magical. I can't recommend them highly enough. Thank you, Rob and team!!

My now husband and I were married on June 23rd, 2018 and Pacific Connection Catering catered our wedding! I would honestly give a million stars if I could!! Rob is like my guardian...

angel. As a bride, you tend to stress and worry about the littlest things and He was there to encourage me and talked me off many ledges! On our actual wedding day, our pastor was running an hour behind and Rob just jumped right in and solved the problem because all of our guests had arrived and he had the awesome idea of switching cocktail hour with the ceremony and no one even knew there was an issue! So Rob alone gets the well deserved 5 stars but OH MY GOD... The FOOD!!!!! We did our tasting a few months prior to the wedding and were so blown away by how good the food was, we didn't even bother talking to anyone else. We both thought, wow if the food is even half as good as the tasting, then itll be ok because we've both attended hundreds of weddings and the food is usually eh... but surprisingly on wedding day... Everything was just as good as we remembered!! I have no idea how she does it!! All of our guests commented and told us afterwards that the food was delicious and some of the best they ever had at a wedding! If you are looking for a caterer... look no further because there is no one better than Pacific Connection!!!! And you can thank me later, but get the chicken and waffles!!!! YUM!!!

Working with Rob and his team was one of the highlights of our wedding planning process and we would highly, highly recommend them for any event. In our opinion, nothing beats work...

ing with smaller, local companies where it’s clear they love what they do and really care about their clients. Other than spending time with friends and family, the most important aspects of our wedding to us were a) food, b) drink and c) well-thought out logistics, so having a good caterer was key. Five star food and five star service at pricing that’s really reasonable, especially when compared to SF caterers. Our guests are still talking about how great the food was – especially the passed hors d'oeuvres and mini desserts. We had salmon, duck and vegetarian entrée options for dinner and our guests all but licked their plates clean. Rob was always reachable and quick to respond during the entire planning process. He took careful notes so every idea we kicked around was always correctly reflected in the revised proposal. He had great ideas and suggestions on everything – not just food but also layout of the site, timeline, etc. We did not have a wedding planner so we found his input invaluable. Some gems we never would have thought of on our own included how to set up the head table to ensure photographer/videographer could get good shots, how to handle staffing so our guests always had a full drink in their hand, thinking of our bridal party’s drinking habits when deciding when to do toasts, etc. Really appreciated his focus on service and efficiency. Rob planned and set up everything in a way to ensure smooth execution and that our guests were never hungry or thirsty. PCC was also great about making sure us and our bridal party were still fed, even as we were running around for pictures during cocktail hour. I have both trust and control issues but Rob and PCC’s experience and attention to detail gave me absolute confidence to relax and enjoy our wedding day.

Rob, his wife, and his team at Pacific Connection were exceptional from our first meeting through the evening of our wedding and beyond. PC was more than a caterer, but rather a tr...

usted partner in an event planning process that is so new to most brides! Rob even suggested table numbers/names to go with our wedding theme (New Orleans). I threw Rob a curveball by not telling him he should expect not only me and my groom, but our three parents, at our initial tasting. We had a charming table setting in PC's kitchen for 2 but Rob happily and quickly adapted to my embarrassing mistake. He made us all feel welcome and like honored guests. The service was unmatchable and the professionalism was top notch. PC made sure that the wedding party and family were served hors d'oeuvres while taking photos and guided bride and groom through the cake cutting process. The food was delicious and we keep receiving compliments from our guests. People have gone out of their way after the wedding to send us text messages about how delicious the food was, some even saying it was the best they had. PC did New Orleans "lite" style food and it was creative and tasty. The price was extremely reasonable for the type of all encompassing service and quality of food Pacific Connection offered. Thank you Pacific Connection!

ember and juggle and Rob helped ensure nothing fell through the cracks. Even when the power for the town went out in the middle of the reception, Rob didn't flinch and was there to help us adjust our plans accordingly.

Everything was so delicious and so well executed. Highly recommend Pacific Connections!

th the crazy brides and grooms. From our first phone call with Rob we felt immediately at ease and like we had found our caterer. He really took the time to get a feel for what we had in mind, and based off of this he and Donna hosted the most amazing tasting that had all the items we were interested in and then some (we rolled out of there full and thrilled were our immediate decision to hire them). They had worked with our venue many times before, which was a confidence boost in itself, and were therefore able to add so much insight and knowledge that we wouldn't have gotten elsewhere. Throughout the whole process Rob was super responsive - answering all our questions thoroughly and promptly. He had great feedback and suggestions based on the venue, and we knew we were in good hands every step of the way. The day of the wedding, Rob and his crew exceeded our expectations (which were already very high based on our interactions up to this point). They were so friendly and on top of everything. We, and more importantly our guests, were beyond impressed with both the food and the service. Oh, the food... where do I begin? They have something for everyone (actually they have everything for everyone... they even made my salmon-hating mother into my salmon-loving mother). We can't recommend them highly enough! Now if only we could get those little chicken & waffle hors d'oeuvres delivered to our home...

ble to fulfill all of our requests without a problem. Not only did he make suggestions about the food and wine pairings, he also had suggestions about the flow of the wedding and reception, that we used. We did not hire a coordinator for the day of our wedding because Rob orchestrated the entire event, including communicating to the DJ for the announcements (i.e. food, cake, port tasting table). All of the food was delicious! Rob's wife is the chef and does a wonderful job with the food and presentation. We had the sea bass with lobster mashed potatoes, the filet, and the pork tenderloin stuff with dried fruits. The food was served to everyone seated at the table at the exact same time. Several of our friends commented on how wonderful that was and one of our single friends told me later that he would like that at his wedding someday as well! Obviously, it made quite an impression. I would recommend using Pacific Connection to anyone!
