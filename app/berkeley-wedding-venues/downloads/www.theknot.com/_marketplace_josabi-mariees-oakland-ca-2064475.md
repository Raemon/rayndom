About this vendor

JoSaBi Mariées is a wedding dress design studio located in Oakland, CA. Inspired by her own fruitless wedding shopping experience, founder Dafra established her boutique as a space where clients, let down by the traditional offerings, can find the dress they deserve. Offering a luxury salon experience, she will give you the creative freedom needed to achieve your dress made to measure uniquely to you. At 5″11, Dafra knows first-hand the struggles of finding a dress that ticks every box. In her experience, finding a form-fitting wedding gown with all the elements she desired and the length she needed was impossible. Abandoning the traditional route, she decided to craft a bespoke gown from scratch, and with that, JoSaBi Mariées was born. Dafra's creative spirit forms the heart of her design studio, as she strives to create custom wedding gowns that complement her client's individual measurements and vision standards. JoSaBi Mariées is an inclusive space open to all sizes, heights, and body shapes. Believing that everyone deserves their dream wedding outfit, Dafra invites you to bring your vision, and she will make it happen.

I don’t even know where to start with how my experience was working with JOSaBi!! I actually was able to see her do two of my cousins wedding dresses so I knew my dress was going ...

to be absolutely amazing!! The process was very easy and to see your vision come to life is really special. The attention to detail on every part of my dress was amazing, the placement of the beading, the lace, and the my ruffles was unmatched. When I finally saw my dress I was in awe. Walking down that isle I felt like a princess and see my husband look at me was something I will never forget. Thank you for making my special day so amazing and for seeing my vision and making it come to life!!! God gave you an amazing gift, I pray that you continue to use it and make brides feel like they are a real life princess!!!!

Working with JoSaBi Mariees was a very pleasant experience. I wouldn’t classify myself as a difficult bride but a more detailed one. I appreciated the ongoing reviews and open comm...

unication about my design. In some aspects I was unsure of what I wanted and she made suggestions that allowed me to trust in her experience. I sent inspiration pics and she turned my design into a mermaid dream. She even suggested a beautiful addition to my veil that made for even better pictures. I would highly recommend them for any bride with a custom dress idea. The price point was also very reasonable compared to other designers I reached out to. Like any business nothing always goes to plan but it is how you recover that matters. Whenever we had an issue they always handled it efficiently and proactively and I truly appreciated that open line of communication. So if you want a custom dress that is designed just for you and made to perfection I would look no further than JoSaBi.

I had such a great experience with JoSaBi! I wanted to include my husband’s Navajo background into my dress while keeping a relatively traditional gown and they helped me make my v...

ision come true!! They were very thoughtful in creating the pattern and asked for help from my new in-laws when they needed it. They were respectful and really great to work with. I really enjoyed my experience. I would recommend them to anyone interested in a personalized gown because they truly were amazing to work with.

I planned my wedding in under three months so, needless to say, I had an very short timeline to find a dress. Going to the wedding dress stores was a huge disappointment. I knew ex...

actly what I wanted and none of them had anything close. I thought there was no way I would have time to order a custom dress, but JoSaBi Mariees assured me they could get it done in six weeks. They completely delivered and I could not have been happier! I was extremely picky and they made the dress exactly the way I wanted it. I wanted vertical seams (way more flattering than the hard break at the waist that every mass-produced dress comes with). I wanted a dress with embellishments and beading on satin (not on tulle!!). This combo is seemingly impossible to find in stores, but they got it done for me and it was beautiful. I wanted touches of pink in the beading. They were able to add that and make my dress a truly unique creation. Finally, I wanted to include pieces of lace from my Mom's wedding dress and they were able to work that into the sleeves beautifully. Of all the somewhat rushed decisions I made in the lead up to my wedding, this was the very best. The price was also very reasonable for a rush order custom dress. If you have an idea of what you want for your wedding dress, PLEASE don't waste your time going to the wedding dress shops. Contact JoSaBi Mariees and let them make you a dress the is one of a kind. You will be glad you did! I am so happy they made me such a special and beautiful dress. Your wedding is a special day and it deserves a dress made especially for you!

What an experience! I contacted JoSaBi Mariees with just an idea for a wedding dress and no idea how to make it come true and no prior sewing or dress making experience. The lovely...

team at JoSaBi helped make that dream a reality and worked with me and kept me updated every step of the way! My dress idea a bit unconventional but they were down for it from the start. Planning took a couple months, but JoSaBi asked for my input on every detail, it was seriously like I was designing it myself. Then the dress was made and delivered within another few months. It did require a few alterations, like making the bodice fit tighter and the train shorter but not much else! I loved the finish product and if you are looking for something completely unique and have the time to make it happen I would highly recommend JoSaBi Mariees.
