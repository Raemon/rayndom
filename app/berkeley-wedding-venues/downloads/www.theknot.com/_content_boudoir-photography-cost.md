If you love the idea of an empowering session where you get to document yourself feeling your absolute sexiest, welcome to boudoir photography. With some wedding photographers, boudoir photography costs are rolled into a larger package, while others book individual sessions or offer it as an add-on.

A boudoir session is usually just a few hours in a studio or at home, sometimes with hair and makeup added on for the ultimate self-care day, but there's so much talent behind the camera to turn it into an enjoyable and confidence-boosting experience. The best photographers will come armed with their best [boudoir photography tips](https://www.theknot.com/content/the-boudoir-wedding-photography-trend) and you'll feel like a pinup model in the best way.

Andreea Burciu-Ballen, owner of [Andreea B Ballen Photography](https://www.andreeabballen.com/) in NYC, explains, "Boudoir is an art that takes continuing education and practice, not just in the actual photographing but also in making each client walk away having had a comfortable, pampering, empowering experience that boosts her confidence and shows her how uniquely beautiful she is."

## Average Boudoir Photography Cost

Boudoir photography costs near you will depend on location. Burciu-Ballen has a $349 session retainer and says, "Clients invest on the average $2,000 to $5,000—though some more and some less." This includes some combination of digital prints, art quality prints and a luxury handcrafted album.

In Braintree, Massachusetts, Lindsay Hite, owner and photographer of [Show Your Spark](https://www.showyourspark.com/), says, "Our Session Fee is $500 with artwork products ranging from $1,500 to $7,900. The average spend of our clients is currently around $4,000."

## What Is Typically Included in a Boudoir Session?

Every boudoir session will include different pieces and add-ons, but generally, when you're booking a boudoir session, you can expect that the photoshoot and edited photos are included at a minimum. Add-ons often include hair and makeup, as well as ordering a photo book or prints.

### Find all the vendors you need

Meet every kind of expert from photographers to photo booth rentals.

### Consultation 

The idea of a boudoir session is usually more intimidating than the session itself. Planning can help take the edge off. "We conduct a 30 to 60-minute Zoom consultation to co-create their dream session and consult on location, what to wear and where to shop, as well as how to prepare for the photoshoot and more," says Burciu-Ballen.

### Professional Hair and Makeup

You can do your own hair and makeup, but having a professional pamper you is part of the experience. Boudoir photographers will often have relationships with hair and makeup teams that they'll bring in as part of the boudoir package. 

### Photoshoot and Studio Space

The photo shoot is often one to two hours, and you may run through several outfit changes. Your photographer will help guide you through the session, helping you pose and making it a more comfortable, accessible experience.

### Edited Photos

You'll receive edited photos following your boudoir session and, usually, this is a much more condensed list than what your photographer originally took. They'll deliver a set of gorgeous photos that you can then choose from to make an album, print or keep all to yourself.

### Art Products

Some boudoir sessions also include printed photo products, whether that's an album or a set of framed prints. These could be included in the price of the package, or you may purchase them separately. 

## Where to Book Your Boudoir Photographer 

Your wedding photographer may offer boudoir packages but, even if they don't, you can find a photographer on [The Knot Vendor Marketplace](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/wedding-photographers). To find a photographer that either offers boudoir exclusively or includes it as part of a larger package, look up your location, click on "more filters" and select "boudoir" under "photo shoot types."

Carefully look through reviews to find what others have to say about the photographers you're researching. This will give you an idea of whether they're the right fit, depending on the type of photography they do, how they put their clients at ease and the final product they deliver.

## How to Understand Boudoir Photographer Quotes 

Boudoir photography is more than just a few hours of photography. There's work before and after the session to make sure it's a comfortable experience with a beautiful final product that aligns with your vision. The talent and expertise that goes into this process should match up with the investment, which can run into the thousands of dollars.

"Clients are looking for a custom-tailored experience with someone who is going to co-create on their vision (or help them establish their vision) all the while making sure they feel comfortable and cared for during an intimate and vulnerable time," says Burciu-Ballen. "I am passionate about showing everyday women of all sizes, shades and ages their own unique beauty. Every woman deserves to see how gorgeous she is and to see herself as art."

That sense of empowerment and beauty is part of why boudoir photography costs what it does. Not everyone can put another human at ease in their most vulnerable moments _and_ deliver a stunning piece of art at the end—that is what these creatives do, and it's why it's so incredible to work with them.
