Plus-size shapewear isn't about making your body fit into single-digit sizing, it's about making you feel your best. As a proud size 12–14 person, I'm all too familiar with the feeling of defeat in a dressing room when an outfit highlights the fuller parts of my body. 

I used to feel like I was making a statement about body positivity by eschewing shapewear for my plus-size body. But recently, I tried on a bodysuit that felt great, smoothed the areas I'm most sensitive about, and made me feel amazing. The result? I was excited to don a more form-fitting dress and found myself standing taller (and smiling more) throughout the evening. For years I had only tried on really uncomfortable shapewear and came to associate it with not feeling great or trying to be someone else. But my recent revelation (while wearing [SKIMS shorts](https://skims.wsktbf.net/c/64733/618913/10056?subId1=TK-plus-size-shapewear&u=https%3A%2F%2Fskims.com%2Fproducts%2Fseamless-sculpt-high-waisted-above-the-knee-short-sienna) that you can read more about below) gave me an epiphany. I came to understand that wearing shapewear for plus-size women isn't succumbing to society's ideals about the female body, rather it's a tool that can make you feel great (which in turn will help you look great and totally glow, in much the same manner as [plus-size lingerie](https://www.theknot.com/content/plus-size-bridal-lingerie)).

As plus-size personal stylist Salifya Akers, founder of [Ahead of the Curve Styling Agency](https://www.aheadofthecurvestyling.com/home), says: "Knowing everything is tucked, supported, and smooth can help you feel confident enough to fully embrace the spotlight, feel camera-ready, and focus on enjoying every moment of your big day."

According to size-inclusive fashion expert [Michaela Leitz](https://www.confidence-style.com/), shapewear should never feel like a punishment. "Your wedding day is not the time to squeeze yourself into something that makes you uncomfortable," she explains. "You deserve to feel secure, sexy and radiant, not restricted, and if it doesn't feel good sitting, dancing, and breathing, it's not the one." Here are our top picks, backed by editor testing, that'll have you feeling sexy, not restricted.

## The Best Plus-Size Shapewear for Every Outfit

Without further ado, here are the best shapewear options for plus-size folks. From bodysuits to corsets, there's a solid shapewear option for every plus-size person out there. 

### *The Knot Favorite* Best Plus-Size Shapewear for Wedding Dress: SKIMS Seamless Sculpt High-Waisted Above-the-Knee Short

![SKIMS Seamless Sculpt High-Waisted Above-the-Knee Short](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/9f7608b2-a3d0-4721-9370-09446b7c8acf~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1075.1075)

SKIMS knows how to make stellar shapewear, especially when it comes to plus-size bridal shapewear. These high-waisted shorts (which have an interior silicone band to prevent rolling and slipping) provide strong compression along the stomach, waist and thighs. The shapewear (made of nylon and elastane) boasts that it provides "bust-to-butt support." 

**Editor review:** "I know I am late to the SKIMS game, but wow, I totally understand the hype now. These [SKIMS](https://skims.wsktbf.net/c/64733/618913/10056?subId1=TK-plus-size-shapewear&u=https%3A%2F%2Fskims.com%2Fproducts%2Fseamless-sculpt-high-waisted-above-the-knee-short-sienna) shorts are comfortable, breathable and effective. I used to be very wary of shapewear since I thought it wasn't possible for it to be both comfortable and powerful, but these shorts proved me wrong. They smooth all the right areas without making me feel like I'm wrapped in sausage casing." –[Hannah Nowack](https://www.theknot.com/content/author/hannah-nowack), Senior Manager, Editorial Brand Content

Many wedding dresses (as well as wedding guest dresses) have eye-catching dramatic low backs, and the last thing you want is to have shapewear peeking out the back of them. That's where this low-back bodysuit comes in. It keeps your back free to show off to the world while expertly shaping your thighs, waistline and hips. It also has adjustable (and convertible) shoulder straps for even more customization based on your outfit. 

**Standout review:** "I love how it feels against my body and how it makes my curves pop! It holds in the areas of concern (belly, low handles, etc) and truly gives me the perfect hourglass shape that I desire." –De'Andra B., [shapellx.com](https://www.shapellx.com/products/low-back-hourglass)

Figuring out [what to wear under your dress](https://www.theknot.com/content/wondering-what-to-wear-under-your-wedding-dress-read-these-tips) is already hard enough, there's no need to complicate matters further with too many pieces of clothing. The great thing about a bodysuit is that it combines body-shaping properties with a built-in bra so you don't have to worry about putting on multiple undergarments. This strapless mid-thigh bodysuit provides all-over compression with a lightly padded [wedding bra](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-dress-bras) to support your chest. 

**Standout review:** "Just what I was looking for! I love the option of changing or removing the straps. It came with additional clear straps and x-ring as well. The most comfortable yet smoothing shapewear I have ever purchased." – Suzanne C., [spanx.com](https://spanx.sjv.io/c/64733/975074/12885?subId1=TK-plus-size-shapewear&u=https%3A%2F%2Fspanx.com%2Fproducts%2Fspanxshape-suit-your-fancy-strapless-cupped-mid-thigh-bodysuit%3FColor%3DChampagne%2BBeige%26v%3D48681213886675)

Is your mid-section the area you're looking to target with your [wedding bridal shapewear](https://www.theknot.com/content/under-thewedding-dress-lingerie-essentials)? This bodysuit, which can be worn with or without straps, needs to be on your radar. The undergarment provides targeted tummy and waist slimming. It includes boning, lined underwire cups, and silicone-lined leg opening for additional support while keeping everything in place. 

**Standout review:** "I just wore this under my dress for my son's wedding and it was very comfortable. It had just the right touch of support and the crotch had bra clips to open and shut…so going to the bathroom with a gown and bodysuit on was a cinch. Buy it! Buy two!" –PattiAnn, [barenecessities.com](https://www.barenecessities.com/products/tc-fine-intimates-extra-firm-control-convertible-bodysuit-4090)

### Best Plus-Size Shapewear Shorts: Honeylove SuperPower Short

When my team started testing products to find the very best plus-size shapewear, I quickly discovered that I wasn't the only person who already owned these Honeylove shorts. At least two of my colleagues had previously purchased SuperPower undergarments from the brand and couldn't stop raving about them. While I'm a fan of the shorts, their entire SuperPower line (which also has thong and brief options) consistently gets rave reviews. 

**Editor review:** "I've owned my pair of these Honeylove SuperPower Shorts for quite some time and find myself constantly reaching for them when I'm getting dressed up for a nice evening out. The boning in the midsection provides amazing support, but also ensures that the shapewear doesn't move around (or fall down) as the evening progresses—perfect for a long wedding day." –[Hannah Nowack](https://www.theknot.com/content/author/hannah-nowack), Senior Manager, Editorial Brand Content

Gone are the days of choosing between targeted compression and avoiding panty lines. This thong under-bust shapewear smooths the midsection while leaving your booty free to rock au naturale. If that's not a win-win for plus-size dress shapewear then I don't know what is. 

**Editor review:** I would consider myself a connoisseur of thong shapewear, having owned at least a dozen different styles over the years in my fight against bellybutton outlines and panty lines. HoneyLove's SuperPower Thong is not only effective; it's _genuinely comfortable_. The side boning, which is covered in soft fabric, creates an hourglass shape at my natural waist without any poking or prodding, while the targeted compression provides supportive (not constricting) tummy control. Definitely go with your regular size to get the best fit, preventing the "sausage casing" feeling or having the shapewear shift or roll under your clothes. –Nic Seligman, Content Strategy Lead

Leave it to Rihanna to perfect a sexy-yet-practical corset. This corset shapewear features supportive underwire, lined balconette cups that'll have your chest looking snatched. It also has metal boning for shaping for your torso. The corset comes with removable straps for versatility and chic rose gold-tone hardware. 

**Standout review:** "Beautiful corset… I'm a 38G so it's very difficult to find a corset that's perfect for the girls. I was pleasantly surprised that it fit." –Tamika, [savagex.com](https://www.savagex.com/products/16173222)

Bear with me as I'm _cheesy_ for a second: While skim milk is weak and a somewhat-sad excuse for milk, SKIMS shapewear is as strong as ever. This SKIMS brief bodysuit is a powerful shapewear option for plus-size women. The scoop neckline and cinched bust flatter the chest area while rounded butt pockets provide lift to the backside. 

**Editor review:** "When my [SKIMS Seamless Sculpt Brief Bodysuit](https://skims.wsktbf.net/c/64733/618913/10056?subId1=TK-plus-size-shapewear&u=https%3A%2F%2Fskims.com%2Fproducts%2Fseamless-sculpt-brief-bodysuit-sienna) first arrived in the mail, I was worried I had ordered the wrong size. It looks tiny when you first take it out of the package, but let me tell you, this thing has some serious stretch. Its unique design is meant to offer compression and tummy control and it certainly delivers on that. After slipping it on (which took a bit of patience given the tight compression), I swear my waist shrunk two sizes. Oh, and wearing it didn't even make it difficult to breathe. This bodysuit is now my secret to achieving an hourglass figure and I feel more confident than ever wearing tight bodycon dresses!" –[Sofia Deeb](https://www.theknot.com/content/author/sofia-deeb), Assistant Fashion Editor

Cute and functional? Yes, please! This bodysuit is half shapewear, half lingerie, and totally amazing. The cheeky-cut of the shapewear's lacy briefs create a smooth, sexy look for your butt while the adjustable straps are great for bust support and comfort. While the white is a must-buy for weddings, it'll be hard not to also add the black and pink to your cart because all three colorways are stunning. 

**Editor review:** "Part of this Pinsy shapewear's charm is that it can double as lingerie or even a flirty top. Honestly, I love the idea of wearing this, paired with a mini skirt, for a bachelorette weekend. It'll have you all sucked in so you're not worrying about things moving around and you can just focus on having fun while looking amazing." –Hannah Nowack, Senior Manager, Editorial Brand Content

### Best Plus-Size Body Shaper Bodysuit: SPANXshape Invisible Open-Bust Mid-Thigh Bodysuit

![SPANX open-bust mid-thigh bodysuit plus size shapewear](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/4c0021ef-9785-496b-b5ed-e3ee05dd6565~rs_768.h-cr_50.0.1550.2000)

Open-bust bodysuits are nice for folks who want the flexibility to wear their own bra while still benefitting from the all-over shaping of a traditional bodysuit piece of shapewear. This SPANX product has breathable, lightweight fabric for all-day comfort and specially designed LYCRA FitSense Print Technology for 360-degree shaping. 

**Editor review:** "When I first received this SPANX bodysuit, I was worried I wasn't going to like the product because of the material. The material is lightweight, so it's ideal for weddings in warmer months (but is a little scratchy). However, if you want to be snatched, THIS is the shapewear for you. It is lifting in the booty area and shaping in the tummy area. I think mid- and plus-size to-be-weds would love this if that's what they're looking for." –Taylor Whitten, Content Strategy Manager

There's a reason shoppers keep returning to SKIMS time and again for plus-size shapewear—it really checks all the boxes. This open-busy bodysuit has double-ply compression on the thighs, elastic adjustable straps for comfort and light butt support to enhance the wearer's figure. And the best part? SKIMS is machine washable for convenience. 

**Editor review:** "This SKIMS bodysuit targets all the areas I want a piece of shapewear to address, which is a major reason that I chose to wear it for my own wedding. The bodysuit does a great job with torso/ midsection smoothing while also providing just the right amount of compression. I also liked that it is made of slightly heavier material and has an open gusset. All in all, this shapewear is one I'd recommend to plus-size to-be-weds who want all-over shaping." –Taylor Whitten, Content Strategy Manager

According to SPANX, this slip "feels like nothing, does everything." The slip gives the wearer all-over shaping with medium compression for a smooth, invisible fit, just like the name suggests. The shapewear is designed with ultra-thin, breathable fabric that is both moisture-wicking and quick-drying making it suitable for wearing during the hot summer months. 

**Standout review:** "I was a little incredulous when the sizing guide's suggestion was for the 3x size, though I was convinced it would be too big. But, no! This was the perfect size! The slip compresses where I need it most and is perfect for smoothing over the unsightly bulges. So lightweight that I could wear it comfortably in the current high humidity and heat. My new SPANX favorite!" –Dawn S., [spanx.com](https://spanx.sjv.io/c/64733/975074/12885?subId1=TK-plus-size-shapewear&u=https%3A%2F%2Fspanx.com%2Fproducts%2Fspanxshape-invisible-cami-slip%3FColor%3DVery%2BBlack%26v%3D48681092055251)

These plus-size shapewear shorts provide the thigh-shaping while also giving the wearer firm torso support with a corset-like middle. The brand notes that this undergarment is designed to have "minimal visibility and maximum shaping" with its built-in and flexible boning. The shorts have specially engineered LYCRA FitSense Print Technology to provide powerful waist and stomach definition. There is also a convenient no-slip waistband so you don't have to worry about the shapewear sliding down. 

**Standout review:** "The definition is insane and the details are everything—sticky waist, opening to use the bathroom, ruching above the butt!

There's snatched, and then there's _snaaaatched_. If you're looking for the latter, this plus-size bodysuit is your ticket. The undergarment has a detachable wrap that targets the mid-section for dramatic sculpting. And with sizing all the way to 6X, this shapewear is one of the most size-inclusive offerings we've found on the market. 

**Standout review:** "This shapewear really snatches your waist! It really gives you a nice silhouette! You can also wear it without the waist wrap and it still brings you in very well. It's comfortable enough to wear everyday but when you want that extra snatchage you can use the wrap. Definitely recommend I also if you're more apple shaped." –Tisha J., [shapellx.com](https://www.shapellx.com/products/airslim-2-0-smooth-wrap-hourglass-shapewear)

The last thing anyone at a wedding wants to deal with is chaffing. If you're on the hunt for shapewear that's light on the sculpting but heavy on the sweat-protection, these shorts are for you. They provide some smoothing while also ensuring your legs don't stick together. 

**Editor review:** "As a thick-thigh girlie, sometimes the main thing I want is protection for my inner thighs, especially during the summer months. I love these shorts because they stay in place (the waistband has a great grip lining), provide light smoothing, and protect me from chaffing. These would be a great option to wear under a light summer sundress for a bridal shower." –Hannah Nowack, Senior Manager, Editorial Brand Content

**Specs:** Size range: S–XL | Colors: 2 | Compression: Light

## How to Choose Plus-Size Dress Shapewear

Whew, you made it through all of our top picks of plus-size shapewear. But how do you decide which undergarment is right for you? Here are some tips for shopping for shapewear plus-size folks can keep in mind. 

![What to look for in plus-size shapewear](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/60741447-04fb-42a0-84d9-633caca54782~rs_768.h)

  * **Comfort:** Shafonne Myers, owner of [Pretty Pear Bride](https://prettypearbride.com/), a wedding inspo site geared toward plus-size nearlyweds, emphasizes that you should only buy shapewear that makes you feel comfortable. "If you can't breathe and can't move, that shapewear is not the one," says Myers. "Shapewear should never be about squeezing yourself into discomfort or trying to 'fix' anything. It's meant to enhance what's already there." 
  * **Stretch and breathability:** Consider the fabric that's used in the garment. Leitz recommends "prioritizing high-stretch, breathable fabrics like microfiber or power mesh that feel soft on the skin and don't roll or dig in."
  * **Seam placement:** It's a small detail, but the impact of poor seam placement may be a major nuisance. "Pay close attention to seam placement and leg openings, those tiny details can make or break how it looks under a gown," says Leitz. 
  * **Designed for plus-size folks:** Seek out shapewear that's intended for plus-size folks. "Plus-size shapewear should be engineered for plus-size bodies, not just scaled-up versions of straight sizes," notes Leitz. "That means better contouring, more comfort, and proper rise in the waist."
  * **Try it on with your dress:** The best shapewear for plus-size women isn't universal, it's highly dependent on what you're planning to wear it under. Leitz encourages shoppers to try shapewear on with your actual outfit. "A style that works under a mermaid silhouette may not feel right under a ballgown or slip dress," notes the expert. "For gowns with sheer elements or unique cuts, like a high slit, deep plunge, or open back, consider more specialized shapewear like high-cut briefs, shaping bodysuits with convertible straps, or even shaping shorts with lace edges that stay invisible." 
  * **Keep your body shape in mind:** Take inventory of your body and the areas you want to target with shapewear. Leitz explains that "knowing your body shape can help you refine your choice." She adds: "If you carry more weight in your lower belly, a firm-control high-waist brief with reinforced panels can feel amazing. If you're curvier through the hips and thighs, look for pieces with stretch zones that don't compress too tightly, so you maintain shape without discomfort. But here's the most important advice: **Shapewear should never erase your body. The goal is not to shrink yourself, but to feel secure, smooth, and powerful in whatever silhouette makes you feel most like you."**
