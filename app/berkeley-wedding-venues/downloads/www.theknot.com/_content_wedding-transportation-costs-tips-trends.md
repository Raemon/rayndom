You may know what you're wearing, what you're eating and who's reading what at your ceremony—but none of that matters if you have no way of getting yourselves (and your wedding party) there. Wedding transportation—whether you ride in a limousine or rent a souped-up retro school bus—is an underrated and crucial detail of your wedding day. Translation: Don't forget to add it to your [wedding planning checklist](https://www.theknot.com/wedding-checklist) and check out the best transport on [The Knot Vendor Marketplace](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/transportation-services). Also, see what couples typically spend on wedding transportation using our [budget tool](https://www.theknot.com/wedding-budget). To help you out, here's the average cost for wedding transportation from The Knot Real Weddings Study, plus a few handy transportation tips that will help you save!

## The Average Cost of Wedding Transportation

So, how much does wedding transportation cost? According to [The Knot Real Weddings Study](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-data-insights/real-weddings-study) of nearly 17,000 people who got married in 2024, the average amount couples in the U.S. spend on wedding transportation is $1,075. But remember, this is an average, which means you could pay more or less depending on your wedding location, among other factors. In fact, here's the average cost of transportation for a wedding by region:

[READ MORE Find the Wedding Transport of Your Dreams on The Knot ](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/transportation-services)

  * **Northeast/New England:** $1,500
  * **Mid-Atlantic:** $1,443
  * **Midwest:** $934
  * **South/Southeast:** $1,039
  * **Southwest:** $755
  * **West:** $932




Other interesting data points? Those who reported having a destination wedding spent (on average) $1,190, which is slightly higher than the broader average cost of wedding transportation. This makes sense, considering a far-flung location may require hiring extra transportation for guests who fly in. But if you break the numbers out by _type_ of destination wedding, those who celebrated domestically paid more (an average of $1,204) than those who celebrated internationally (an average of $839). As for local "hometown" weddings? The price of transportation averaged $1,044.

The number of guests you're planning on transporting also plays a role in how much you'll spend. According to our study, couples who hosted weddings with 50 or fewer guests spent $583 on transportation, while those with over 100 guests spent nearly $1,200. If you're planning on having a shuttle service for your guests, it's important to make room in your wedding budget.

## What's Included in Wedding Transportation Costs

![how much does wedding transportation cost](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/6b5031dc-e6ea-44d8-9ddf-155d5b7a5e66~rs_768.h-cr_0.49.2084.2133)

_Illustration by: Natalie Romine_

You're likely to be charged by the hour for a car service, depending on the type of vehicle and number of passengers. Town car and wedding limo prices could range from $75 to $150 per hour, or higher ($200 to $300) for something fancier or larger, like a party bus to shuttle guests. That said, we can't emphasize enough that there's no true "standard" cost.

### Find your kind of venue

From barns to ballrooms, discover reception venues that feel like you.

A [15 to 20 percent tip](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-vendor-tipping-cheat-sheet) is typically expected too and might even be included in your [transportation contract](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-transportation-contract-points) (sales tax may also be charged). If it's not included, a $20 tip for each driver normally covers your bases. You may be required to contract the cars for a minimum amount of time, say, three hours—but don't be surprised if you end up booking them for the whole day. The parking service bill should also reflect a 15 to 20 percent gratuity charge. In this case, make sure guests know there's no need to tip.

## Additional Wedding Transportation Expenses

When planning for your wedding-day transportation, there may be more involved than simply booking a car or limo. Here are some other transportation-related expenses to include in your budget.

### Parking

Having your reception at a hotel, restaurant, banquet hall or special events facility? The on-site wedding planner may be taking care of parking arrangements and staff. If not (or if you prefer to hire an independent service), here are some guidelines: Valets are attendants that physically park cars for guests upon arrival, retrieve them when guests leave and staff the parking area for the duration of the event. Non-valet attendants direct traffic, hold signs, point you toward available spaces and staff the area. This often costs $20 to $25 per attendant, but again, it really depends. Figure five valets (or three or four non-valets) per 100 guests.

And one more tip: The manager should check out the location to determine the number of attendants needed— _before_ quoting a price. Keep in mind that factors like meager to non-existent parking facilities, massive guest lists and complicated locations will require more manpower and add to the cost.

### Guest Transportation

Whether or not you provide transportation for all your guests will depend on your budget, wedding venue locations and how many out-of-town guests are attending. But at the very least, it's a nice gesture to have rides arranged for the wedding party and VIPs, like both sets of parents and grandparents.

Other factors to consider include the weather (ugh, we know). Picture 150 guests competing for cabs during an impromptu post-ceremony thunderstorm. Look into booking a wedding bus rental or a couple of minivans if you think this could happen. Consider too the distance between ceremony and reception—you may want to cover longer rides.

Before you spend on guest transportation, see if your wedding ceremony or reception venue offers complimentary services. In fact, it's worth [asking when you tour locations](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-venue-site-tour-questions-to-ask) (if you haven't already). To avoid the cost of a wedding shuttle, you can also try to make a deal with the hotel you've booked [room blocks](https://www.theknot.com/content/hotel-room-blocks-101) at—it may be able to provide free transportation.

Even if you don't book transportation for your wedding guests, there are ways to help them book their own. Provide rideshare information, the phone numbers of reputable cab companies or see if you can negotiate special rates for attendees.

## How to Cut Wedding Transportation Costs

As with a wedding cake or wedding dress, the easiest way to cut costs is to keep things simple. Here are a few tips that may save you some money on your wedding transportation.

  * **Skip the stretch.** For your [wedding limo](https://www.theknot.com/content/are-wedding-limos-a-must), stick with your standard six-person town car instead of a stretch limo—the former is also a limousine, just not as long. Even the color of the car can make a difference to your bottom line—black and silver cars are usually cheaper than white ones during wedding season.  
  

  * **Encourage carpooling.** The cheapest way to transport wedding guests is to have them carpool—if someone doesn't mind driving, that is. This is especially helpful if you're expecting a lot of out-of-towners to attend. But unless you have a sober designated driver in the group, it's smart to book a car service for at least their rides home from the reception.  
  

  * **Leave out amenities.** Leave out the TV, full bar and sunroof. Stash some champagne of your own in the car so you can toast each other on the way to the reception. (The limo company may be able to include complimentary bubbles if they know you're a wedding party—ask about this.)  
  

  * **Ask for freebies or extras.** Don't be afraid to ask the rental company what extras they can throw in free of charge with your wedding package. In addition to complimentary champagne, this can include decorations (such as a 'Just Married' sign or ribbons), a car upgrade to a more luxurious model, a personalized note or gift, or something else entirely. You'll never know if you don't ask!  
  

  * **Be wary of paying for waiting time.** Arrange for pick-up and drop-off service only, so that drivers aren't waiting around (and getting paid—remember, you're being charged by the hour) for the duration of the ceremony and reception.  
  

  * **Book as early as possible.** If your big day falls during peak times (think: prom time or graduation season in March to late June), you may want to [find wedding transportation](https://www.theknot.com/content/find-wedding-transportation-services) five or six months before your wedding date. The more competitive the market, the more you could pay.  
  

  * **Prepare (and share) the right information.** Prep a call sheet with names and all pickup/drop-off addresses and times, so you can call to confirm these arrangements with the transportation company the day before or morning of the wedding. The more seamless the process, the less likely you'll incur unexpected costs like wait time fees.  
  

  * **Get creative.** Considering alternative or non-traditional [wedding transportation ideas](https://www.theknot.com/content/new-wedding-transportation-ideas) is not only a great way to showcase your personalities and make your wedding unique—it can also save money. Golf carts, repurposed school buses, vintage cars and even tandem bikes are other transportation options that could be less expensive than the average wedding limo rates.
