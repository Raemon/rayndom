Rancho Solano is a GREAT place to get married at. Its affordable, staff in awesome and very professional. They also offer MILITARY DISCOUNT! which is great because 80% of residents...

around fairfield/vacaville is military. Suzy is a great person she is like your little wedding planner so you don't have to hire one. She helps you through everything and is there from beginning to end making sure your day is as special as you dreamed of. Also she has list of florist, djs, photographers, and ministers. So you don't have to worry about finding one. I give Rancho Solano a 20! They will work with you. So if you are planning a wedding around Vacaville, Fairfield, Cordilla, dixon, GO with Rancho Solano and tell them SERINA sent you!
