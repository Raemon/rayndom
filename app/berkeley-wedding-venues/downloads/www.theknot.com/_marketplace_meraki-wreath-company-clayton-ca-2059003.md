In addition to all of that, they designed beautiful centerpieces with floating candles and greenery and designed a little floral collar for our dog. During our wedding many guests came up to us to tell us how beautiful the florals were! Truly incredibly well done and I'm so happy I booked them!

WOW--We cannot recommend Ashley and Thelma enough. Flowers were really important to me and my bride and we were blown away by what Meraki delivered. They were friendly to work with...

, creative in their designs, and were able to put together gorgeous pieces. We got married in a planetarium so it was important to really transform the place so it still felt like a wedding for my bride and I. During the months of planning we had several phone and video calls with them to discuss colors, designs, and how many pieces we wanted. A month before they walked the planetarium with us to help design the floral statement pieces. They were incredibly generous with their time, and so professional and responsive (and honestly, also so FUN) throughout the whole process. They also personalized the whole experience to exactly what we needed (which in our case, included some Star Wars flair!) We ended up with several gorgeous pieces for our ceremony including a BEAUTIFUL 8 foot semi-arch that looked like a crescent moon. Thelma and Ashley were fun, creative, and the flowers were stunning. I snuck in while guests were getting seated and seeing the fairy lights, the flowers, and the arch was the second time I started to cry (the first was during the first look with my wife).

d a smaller one for my maid of honor. They included a variety of roses, greenery, and unique flowers. I am not a Pinterest Bride so during our initial consultation, I showed them a few ideas I liked, what my color profile is, and let them know that I want them to use their expertise. I was blown away with how beautiful the flower arrangements looked. My bouquet was a perfect size for me. Not too small and not too large. Super easy to hold. Everything smelled great and lasted throughout the day. After the wedding, I dried my bouquet and put the maid of honor bouquet into a vase at my house. We also had three small silk flower crowns made for the flower girls. This was a great keepsake gift for them, and they looked like cute little fairy children. I was so happy when they told me that they were able to provide an arch to be used during the ceremony. They set up the arch with the flowers affixed before we even arrived and post ceremony it was moved to behind our sweetheart table. The flowers affixed to the arch were just stunning. A variety of colors just like we wanted. Red, yellow, pink, blush, green. It definitely provided that pop of color that our venue needed. We were an anti-white flower wedding, and they definitely stepped up to the plate with that. They went above and beyond with helping us create are unique centerpieces. I did find an inspiration picture from Pinterest, but ours came out much better. It had a wood round with some greenery, a yellow Chinese lantern on it with greenery and flowers affixed to the top. They were stunning and not your typical wedding centerpieces. We received so many compliments. The ladies also went above and beyond with helping my mother, bustle my dress, as well as helped take the floral cages that were fixed to the arch back to the studio for the day, because my hands were so full at the end of the wedding. I cannot recommend this company enough. They were extremely affordable, easy to communicate and work with. But the best thing of all the flowers were absolutely stunning.
