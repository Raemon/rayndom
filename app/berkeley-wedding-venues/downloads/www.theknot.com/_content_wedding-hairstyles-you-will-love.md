## FAQs About Wedding Hairstyles

When it comes to hair, we understand that there's no "one size fits all" style. The best bridal hairstyle will be different for every newlywed. But how do you go about weighing your options? We've rounded up some helpful tips below.

### What wedding hairstyles are popular in 2025?

Hollywood waves are one of the biggest [current bridal hairstyles](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-hair-trends). Many modern brides love the timeless and elegant look they offer. As for [bridal updos](https://www.theknot.com/content/updos-for-long-hair), we've been loving slicked-back [bun hairstyles](https://www.theknot.com/content/bun-hairstyles-for-wedding) (inspired by none other than Sofia Richie Grainge). Of course, [wedding ponytails](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-ponytail-hairstyles) and [half-up hairstyles](https://www.theknot.com/content/half-up-hairstyles-for-long-hair) will always have a place in the bridal hair world–they're just so convenient!

### Should I wear my hair up or down for my wedding?

The short answer? It totally depends. If you want to highlight your [dress neckline](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-gown-neckline-glossary) or a piece of jewelry, you might decide to go for an updo. Be sure to think about your bridal hair when [choosing wedding jewelry](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-to-pick-jewelry-to-match-your-wedding-dress). (You probably won't want to splurge on a pricey pair of earrings if they won't even be seen!) On the other hand, if you prefer the ease and freedom of wearing your hair down (and don't care too much about it covering the top part of your dress), then that's the way to go. Whether you decide to wear it up or down, there are plenty of [bridal hair accessories](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-hair-accessories) to choose from. 

### How do I know which bridal hairstyle is right for me?

There are three things you'll want to consider before [choosing a wedding hairstyle](https://www.theknot.com/content/choosing-a-wedding-day-hairstyle): Your hair length, your [hair type](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-hair-type-tips) and your personal preference. The best bridal hairstyle for you will differ depending on whether you have [short hair](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-hairstyles-short-hair), [medium-length hair](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-hairstyles-medium-hair), [long hair](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-hairstyles-long-hair), [curls or waves](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-hairstyles-for-curly-hair). We recommend browsing through inspo pics of brides with similar hair to you to get ideas. **Pro tip:** Pinterest lets you easily filter search results by hair type.

## 60 Wedding Hairstyles to Save to Your Vision Board

To help you on your search for the perfect wedding hairstyles, we've gathered up plenty of inspo from real brides. Scroll through these 60 hair for wedding ideas and be sure to screenshot all your faves to show your stylist.

### 1\. Hollywood Waves With Bangs Tucked Behind Ears




![Sleek, soft bridal waves](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/3896a78c-1029-4502-b399-f5e52ca0842d~rs_768.h-cr_3.0.1092.1452)

_[Photo: Annie Piland Photography](https://anniepiland.com/),__[Hair: Micki HairArtistry](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/micki-hairartistry-mount-pleasant-sc-2069660)_

Bouncy, bold and beautiful–It's no wonder why Hollywood waves are one of the most popular bridal hairstyles right now. To achieve this look, have your stylist create uniform curls all going in the same direction. Brush them out, add plenty of hairspray and voilà!

### 2\. Classic Updo With Curled Hanging Strands




![Classic updo with soft curls](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/f2faba18-51c1-4a64-abbd-7c73cbcfe8ae~rs_768.h-cr_0.91.1094.1550)

_[Photo: Brandi Allyse Photo](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/brandi-allyse-photo-dfw-tx-977508)_

An updo is perhaps the most quintessential bridal hairstyle out there. It's timeless, romantic and best of all, pairs perfectly with a veil. For an effortless look, let a few strands of hair down at the front, then add some curls to help them frame up the face.

### 3\. Loose Curls With Side Part




![Loose curls with side part](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/195848e5-827f-488d-9b6a-f9ee7f9c4283~rs_768.h-cr_0.180.1080.1620)

_[Photo: Tara Beth Photography](https://www.tarabethphotography.com/)_

Wearing your hair down and curled on your wedding day? Here's a pro tip from our editors: Add in a few clip-in extensions to the underside of your hair. They'll give your look a bit more body, and no one will even know they're there! 

### 4\. Slicked-Back Bun




![Slick back low bun](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/cfdcfa85-82a1-4830-82ba-7b870c58c5a7~rs_768.h-cr_0.58.1094.1517)

[Sofia Richie Grainge](https://www.theknot.com/content/sofia-richie-relationship) broke the internet when she sported a slicked-back bridal bun during her 2023 nuptials, thus starting the "quiet luxury" trend. The good news for 2025 brides is that this trend is showing zero signs of slowing down. 

### 5\. High Bun With Face-Framing Bangs




![High bun with face framing](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/14934fd1-20fa-4428-969c-35328ded6758~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1080.1440)

_[Photo: Ruét Photo](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/ruet-photo-georgetown-tx-768995)_

Looking for a way to elevate your updo? Leave out two sections of hair from the front of your head (each about one inch thick) and use them to frame up your face. You can straighten or curl them depending on your personal preference.

### 6\. Loose Waves With Center Part




![Loose waves with center part](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/90303fea-4531-4991-b556-a50efb7094ca~rs_768.h-cr_0.167.1094.1626)

Trends may come and go but soft waves with a center part will always have a place in the bride hair world. They're utterly timeless and easy to achieve. Better yet? You can wear them with a wedding veil or just about any other hair accessory.

### 7\. Top Knot With Braids




![To knot with braids](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/20ec1716-a408-41fd-8a19-b8b6ecbcda3e~rs_768.h-cr_0.100.600.900)

_[Photo: A Sea of Love](https://www.aseaoflove.com/)_

Getting hitched in the summertime? Consider a top knot bridal hairstyle that will keep your tresses or braids from sticking to the back of your neck in the event you work up a sweat on the dance floor.

### 8\. Twisted Updo




![Twisted bun updo](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/90c4d4a8-9624-40a1-994d-a63c53b514ac~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1080.1440)

_[Photo: Elevate Photography](https://elevatephotography.com/)_

This intricate twisted updo takes elegance to the next level. By meticulously pining small pieces into place, the stylist was able to achieve a hair design that doubles as a work of art. Better yet? It doesn't distract from the back of the dress.

### 9\. Half-Up, Half-Down With Curls




![Half up and half down hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/acc1d57c-c67e-48cf-ac6d-cde37d3ef6fc~rs_768.h-cr_0.93.1094.1552)

_[Photo: Banga Studios](https://www.bangastudios.ca/)_

If you love wearing your hair down but constantly find yourself fidgeting with the front pieces, a half-up, half-down bridal hairstyle might be the one for you. There are endless ways to make this look your own, including adding curls, braids or even accessories.

### Find your kind of venue

From barns to ballrooms, discover reception venues that feel like you.

### 10\. Ballerina Bun With Face-Framing Bangs




![Ballerina bun with center part](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/68c37e8a-a063-4397-b521-d81e58613f2e~rs_768.h-cr_0.81.1094.1540)

_[Photo: MC Weddings](https://www.mc-weddings.com/),__[Hair: Cabo Makeup](https://cabomakeup.com/)_

This bride wore a statement-making two-piece set to her wedding, so naturally she wanted a hairstyle that would complement it, rather than compete with it. By slicking her hair into a tight bun, leaving just a few face-framing pieces out, she was able to do just that.

### 11\. Half-Up, Half-Down With Slicked-Back Ponytail




![Slick back ponytails wit half up and half down](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/04cfeaf0-93e7-4568-9153-66e78259d069~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1080.1440)

If you're into the "clean girl" aesthetic but still want to wear your hair down, you'll love this hairdo for your wedding. With a sleek ponytail on the top and relaxed waves on the bottom, it offers the best of both worlds.

### 12\. Classic Curls With Side Part and Hair Clip




![Classic curls with side part](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/a046ec76-97b3-470d-abd0-fd2f4590469b~rs_768.h-cr_0.90.1080.1530)

_[Photo: Jessica Roberts Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/jessica-roberts-photography-lexington-sc-877486)_

You're the star of your big day, and your wedding hair should show it. Use hot rollers or a wide-barrel curling iron to create bold, bouncy curls with volume. Finish off your look with a sparkly hair accessory and get ready to turn heads.

### 13\. Simple Twisted Updo

If you don't want to distract from your wedding gown's neckline, (or your bridal necklace), a simple updo is the way to go. We love how this bride wore her veil draped off the back of the bun.

### 14\. Brushed-Out Curls With Center Part and Headband




![Brushed out curls](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/2197b6d4-6e19-4b5e-b940-60cc97bbbf5d~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1094.1458)

When it comes to your wedding hair, don't overthink things. Go with a look that feels true to your everyday style, like these loose waves with straight ends. They're perfect for any occasion (your wedding day included). 

### 16\. Wedding Hair With Veil

_[Photo: Julia K.](https://juliakaptelova.com/)_

Want to show off your shoulders on the wedding day? Consider asking your hairstylist to do a simple wedding updo. For a polished look, pull all the locs back into a French twist. For a more lived-in style, curl your locs, put them in a high bun and let a few locs frame the face and neck.

### 25\. Tight Low Bun

Want to show off your bridal earrings? Opt for a tight low bun. Start by applying a generous amount of gel to your roots, then use a boar bristle brush to spread it out evenly throughout the hair. Secure your bun with bobby pins or a hair tie and get ready to shine.

When it comes to pinned-up hair for weddings, this remains a classic for a reason. Sweep your hair back and pin it into a simple, elegant low chignon. Add some volume at the top by teasing it, or leave it as is—either way, you can't go wrong with this one.

### 30\. Loose Updo With Curled Hanging Strands




![Loose updo with curled hanging strands](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/dafedd34-acd7-46d7-a4f4-491b3fc7174b~rs_768.h-cr_0.89.1080.1529)

_[Photo: Love and Covenant Photography Inc.](https://www.loveandcovenant.com/)_

This loose updo is perfect for brides who love the idea of wearing their hair down, but the practicality of having it up. Wispy flyaways delicately frame the face for that sexy windblown look (without the need of actual wind). 

### 31\. Bridal Ponytail




![Bridal ponytail](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/f5b11472-fbf9-48f9-b439-2a1f0ce2e7f7~rs_768.h-cr_0.182.1094.1641)

_[Photo: Janey Pakpahan Photography](https://janeypakpahan.com/),__[Hair: Nine Zero One Salon](https://ninezeroonesalon.com/)_

This style is low-maintenance but high romance. Just pull your natural waves into a relaxed ponytail wedding hairstyle and you'll be ready to walk down the aisle. More importantly, you'll be able to hit the dance floor without hair in your face.

### 32\. Updo With Braid and Pearl Accessories




![Low bun with braid](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/7957e6ac-d90e-4d21-9107-34a4952ca83e~rs_768.h-cr_2.0.1078.1435)

_[Photo: Anya Kernes](https://www.anyakernesphotography.com/)_

Artsy yet simple, this braided wedding hairstyle will look breathtaking on any bride. Keep it as is, or add even more glam by way of some embellished hair pins or fresh flowers. The secure braid will ensure the wind doesn't ruin your 'do if you're having an outdoor wedding.

### 33\. Low Bun With Curled Front Strands




![Low bun with curled front strands](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/15a2ce83-38f9-4e72-a3fe-3500b70ff874~rs_768.h-cr_0.182.1094.1641)

Here's another updo to add to your list of ideas for wedding hair. We love that this bride's stylist pulled her hair back in sections to create the appearance of movement, almost like it was blowing in the wind.

### 34\. Soft Curls




![Soft curls](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/0ec03204-0fe1-4d29-883e-923732de5d1a~rs_768.h-cr_0.20.1094.1479)

_[Photo: Megan Noll Photography](https://megannollphotography.com/),__[Hair: High Five Salon](https://www.highfivesalon.com/)_

Keep things simple by opting for soft natural waves on your wedding day. You can achieve this look by using a small barrelled wand, or a straightener with rounded edges. Use one-inch pieces of hair and keep them on the heat for just a few seconds.

### 35\. Simple Updo With Natural Curls




![Simple updo with natural curls](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/c459b711-5b15-4132-b924-e8419d25a217~rs_768.h-cr_0.165.1094.1624)

_[Photo: Zha Zha Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/zha-zha-photography-sunnyvale-ca-993433)_

There's no limit to the number of gorgeous wedding hairstyles you can achieve with natural curls. The bride above pinned hers into an updo, keeping a few strands of hair free to show off her texture.

### 36\. Hollywood Waves With Side Part and Hair Clip




![Hollywood waves with side part](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/36291701-cc8a-4d46-8b3a-91e0af3f416e~rs_768.h-cr_34.0.1059.1367)

_[Photo: Stanlo Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/stanlo-photography-miramar-fl-985980),__[Hair: Dominique Norton](https://www.instagram.com/dommiecole/)_

Here's a wedding hairstyle that commands attention. This bride opted for Hollywood waves with mega volume. To achieve this look, have your stylist tease your hair a bit before curling it. Then, apply a generous amount of thickening spray for all day body and shine.

### 37\. Half-Up, Half-Down With Loose Waves




![Half-up and half-down with loose waves](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/5044e1c1-c646-4e68-8b2a-efc96abe7eef~rs_768.h-cr_0.44.1094.1503)

_[Photo: Divine Day Photography](https://www.divineday.uk/)_

A half-up, half-down is a wedding hairstyle that is always perfect for a laid-back wedding on the beach. You can rock the style with straight hair, curls or waves. Just add a bit of texture spray, and you are ready to say, "I do."

### 38\. Half-Up, Half-Down With High Ponytail and Face-Framing Bangs




![Sleek half-up and half-down hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/d4bc6834-f77f-451d-8188-22503bc03f00~rs_768.h-cr_0.91.1094.1550)

_[Photo: 515 Photo Co](https://www.515photoco.com/),__Hair: Posh by LaGlam_

Whether you're a guest (or the guest of honor), this hair for a wedding is guaranteed to please. Slick the top half of your hair into a high ponytail, leaving out your bangs. Straighten or curl the bottom half and you're good to go.

### 39\. Bridal Hair Bun With Tiara




![Bridal hair bun with tiara](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/aa34c789-12df-4fd9-9fee-a6246ec6828f~rs_768.h-cr_0.139.1094.1598)

You deserve to feel like royalty on your special day, starting from the moment you sit down in the glam chair. For a regal look, have your stylist give you a volumized updo. Then, top it off with a glistening [bridal tiara](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-tiaras) or crown. 

### 40\. Curls With Center Part




![Curls with center part](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/7bdd6a87-9373-4298-8bf1-3bb7fba77081~rs_768.h-cr_0.178.1080.1618)

_[Photo: Meg Seitz Photography](https://megseitzphotography.com/)_

You can spend hours scrolling through countless pictures of wedding hairstyles, or you can stick to a style you know (and love). Classic curls with a center part are a go-to look for any occasion, and your wedding is no exception.

### 41\. Straight Bob With Bangs and Headband




![Straight bob with bangs](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/4ac4801a-a885-4435-8709-7f648a98aec9~rs_768.h-cr_0.190.1094.1649)

_[Photo: Jes Workman](https://www.jesworkman.com/)_

Short hair doesn't have to limit your options when it comes to hairstyles for your wedding. This bride, for instance, employed the help of some iridescent pearl accessories to achieve the ultra-glamorous look she craved. 

### 42\. Half-Up, Half-Down With Loose Waves and Fresh Flowers




![Waves with fresh florals in hair](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/cf9d0535-9d3b-495b-8223-1e2aaf913da8~rs_768.h-cr_0.182.1094.1641)

Bouquets aren't just for holding anymore. Elevate your destination wedding hairstyle by adding a braid or twist around the crown of your head, then sticking flowers into it. You can use floral hairpins or fresh flowers from your actual bouquet.

### 43\. Curled Locs




![Curled locs](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/91ed3f4d-3db4-41f3-a843-35cf3645dca8~rs_768.h-cr_0.180.1080.1620)

_[Photo: Kylie Hinson Photography](https://kyliehinson.com/)_

Don't let your locs or braids keep you from trying out the bride hairstyles you love. This bride added glamorous curls and a side part to her locs proving that there's no shortage of options. Pro tip: Be sure to use plenty of heat protectant to avoid damaging your hair.

### 44\. Sideswept Blowout With Side Part




![Sideswept blowout with side part](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/2e49ecb9-e156-4337-a15a-ff6a4551ae7b~rs_768.h-cr_0.182.1094.1641)

_[Photo: Angela Lally Photography](https://angelalallyphotography.com/),__[Hair: Molly Makeup + Hair](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/molly-makeup-+-hair-driftwood-tx-821857)_

This sideswept bridal hair styling gives off major cool girl vibes, wouldn't you say? To secure the hair to one side, you could place a few bobby pins on the back of the head, or you could even add in some braids.

### 45\. Waves With Side Part and Hair Clip




![Waves with side part](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/148cf3fe-3dea-4167-8c4e-838abce44630~rs_768.h-cr_0.181.1094.1640)

You can take any of the classic bridal hairdos from above and dial it up with a gorgeous hair accessory. Follow this beautiful bride's lead by adding a trendy [pearl headpiece](https://www.theknot.com/content/pearlcore-wedding-fashion) to your day-of 'do.

### 46\. Loose Waves With Center Part




![Loose waves with center part](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/65621c93-1654-4804-9c11-93278e719cfd~rs_768.h-cr_0.69.1094.1528)

_[Photo: Brie Thomason Photography](https://briethomason.com/)_

You won't need to set aside hours of your morning to achieve this cute wedding hair. All you'll need is a curling wand and 15 minutes. Take one-inch pieces of hair and wrap them around the wand, facing away from the face. Spray them with hairspray and you're good to go.

### 47\. Voluminous Updo With Side Part




![Voluminous up do with side part](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/64a58342-711b-44ca-a8ef-c724e521e686~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1080.1440)

_[Photo: Whims and Joy](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/whims-and-joy-minneapolis-mn-986231),__[Hair: The Beauty Lounge](https://www.mplsbeautylounge.com/)_

A structural updo is one of the most timeless hairstyles for weddings. It keeps the hair out of the way and looks elegant while doing so. If you plan on wearing a veil, you can clip it directly onto the bun.

### 48\. Half-Up, Half-Down With Voluminous Curls




![Half-up and half-down voluminous curls](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/15ce0774-1b66-4d21-95cc-9ee648a8e225~rs_768.h-cr_0.13.1094.1472)

This has to be one of the most romantic bride hairstyles out there. With long, voluminous curls, a half-up ponytail and a golden tiara on top, this bride channelled her inner Disney princess and you can too.

### 49\. Textured Waves




![Textured waves](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/0b765d0f-3113-4cc4-a928-8cebe0adb88c~rs_768.h-cr_0.17.1094.1476)

_[Photo: Jeremy Chou Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/jeremy-chou-photography-rancho-cucamonga-ca-497551)_

No matter the length of your locks, you can't go wrong with textured waves for your wedding hair. Since they don't require any bobby pins or excessive products, they're ideal for any low-maintenance bride.

### 50\. Natural Curls With Hair Clip




![Natural curls with hair clip](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/258cd3d0-5c0b-48ab-9cd9-a2e3ed1cfb4c~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1094.1459)

The best wedding hairdos highlight your natural features, rather than hiding them. Take this bride's beautiful coils as a prime example. We love that she added a glam hair comb to one side for that extra "it" factor.

### 51\. Braided Bun With Pearl Accessory




![Braided bun with pearl accessory](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/d6eabde7-3fb8-4f78-bd0f-e8d469071e02~rs_768.h-cr_0.2.1094.1461)

_[Photo: Kerry Jeanne Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/kerry-jeanne-photography-buckley-wa-876006),__[Hair: Rachel Makeup](https://www.rachelxmakeup.com/)_

This unique wedding hairstyle most definitely turned heads. The bride topped off her braided bun with a strand of pearls. She let them drape down her neck to draw attention to her gown's open back.

### 52\. Curls With Natural Flowers




![Curls with natural flowers](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/9f62d6ea-836f-4f26-99cf-e5c014f3941c~rs_768.h-cr_0.184.1094.1643)

_[Photo: Cindy Lee Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/cindy-lee-photography-ballwin-mo-415643)_

Here's an easy bridal hairstyle that'll look like you spend hours at the salon. Curl your hair using a wand with a one-inch barrel. Then, take two pieces of hair from the front and secure them together on the back of the head using a barrette or floral hair clip.

### 53\. Straightened Bob With Bangs




![Straightened bob with bangs](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/44e551b6-fdb0-44b6-8be4-c2c08f89bece~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1094.1459)

_[Photo: Tee & Rebecca](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/tee-and-rebecca-salinas-ca-2023935)_

When it comes to edgy wedding day hairstyles, you can't go wrong with a sharp straightened bob with bangs. If you're contemplating making the big chop, consider this: Short hair can drastically cut down your styling time on your wedding morning.

### 54\. Updo With Natural Curls




![Up do with natural curls](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/4e5ef131-de72-4ff1-a507-2a2a6ed0d1e3~rs_768.h-cr_0.89.1080.1529)

_[Photo: The Heims](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/the-heims-atlanta-ga-978670)_

Embrace your natural curls in a bold way with this wedding hairstyle. You can use an adjustable ponytail holder to secure your hair at the top of your head. Apply some mouse to add shine and fight frizz throughout the day.

### 55\. Boho Braided Half-Up, Half-Down




![Bob braided half-up and half-down hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/897c0a25-302b-4865-bf42-8d54c7bdbd1c~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1094.1459)

_[Photo: Bo Shim](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/bo-shim-new-york-ny-980553)_

Here's one of our favorite boho bride hairstyle ideas. In addition to soft natural waves, this look also features a braid that wraps around the back of the head. The bride pictured above used an embellished hair accessory to secure the style. 

### 56\. Voluminous Updo With Slicked-Back Bangs




![Voluminous updo with slicked bangs](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/2c46d8c6-4c20-4c62-9ab2-bb5612120e7a~rs_768.h-cr_0.2.1094.1461)

If you're looking for wedding hair ideas with plenty of volume, consider this look. By thoroughly teasing your hair before putting it into an updo, you'll be able to achieve that glamorous look you crave. Just make sure to smooth out the top layer of hair using a boar bristle brush.

### 57\. Boho Twisted Updo




![Boho braided updo](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/cf6acc1e-4545-47b3-9800-a77a0e3a6330~rs_768.h-cr_0.17.1080.1457)

_[Photo: Rebecca Yale Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/rebecca-yale-photography-los-angeles-ca-546722),__Hair: Mahogany Hair Revolution_

Give your wedding hairstyle an unexpected twist (literally) by getting flat twists added to the back. It's a small detail that certainly won't go unnoticed as you're walking down the aisle.

### 58\. Fishtail Braid With Curled Front Strands




![Fishtail braid with curled front strands](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/7dfe5f50-5732-4db9-a4c3-767079107d0c~rs_768.h-cr_0.17.1094.1476)

_[Photo: Rebecca Yale Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/rebecca-yale-photography-los-angeles-ca-546722)_

If you want your hair out of the way but don't want to commit to a full updo, consider a braided wedding hairstyle. We love this fishtail braid because it's perfectly undone, so you don't have to worry about pieces coming loose during your outdoor summer wedding.

### 59\. Beach Waves With Boho Headpiece




![Beach waves with boho headpiece](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/4f8ef747-f49e-4e1a-9e2b-aa1db2698396~rs_768.h-cr_0.181.1094.1640)

If you love the way your hair looks after spending the day at the beach, this just might be the bridal hair for you. Use a thin wand to add soft waves to your hair. Then, spray your entire head with a sea salt spray. 

### 60\. Elegant Updo With Hair Clip




![Elegant updo with hairclip](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/deb2583b-ca16-4d11-8d84-02bedeb80625~rs_768.h-cr_3.0.1092.1452)

_[Photo: Katie Shuler Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/katie-shuler-photography-thousand-oaks-ca-557831),__Hair: Hair and Makeup Unveiled_

Take any elegant updo to the next level by adding a sparkly hair clip to your bun. The extra sparkle will catch your guest's attention all throughout the day, but especially as you're walking down the aisle.
