Every love story carries its own rhythm, emotion, and beauty. At Danielle Kinney Imagery, I capture the moments that unfold naturally... the glances, the laughter, the quiet in-betweens, and turn them into timeless imagery that feels as genuine as the love it reflects. My approach is grounded in connection. I believe the most beautiful images come from a place of comfort and trust, where you can simply be yourselves. With an eye for soft light, cinematic composition, and authentic emotion, I craft photographs that feel effortless, elegant, and alive with meaning. Based in Northern California and available wherever love leads, my work is for the beautiful souls who value storytelling that’s both artful and deeply felt.

Danielle Kinney

Owner

Hi, I’m Danielle; wedding photographer, romantic at heart, and lover of all things timeless and full of love. I feel incredibly blessed to wake up each day and do what I love: telling love stories through my lens, guided by heart, light, and the beauty of connection. Wedding photography, for me, is so much more than capturing a ceremony; it's about documenting the soul of a moment. The tenderness in a glance. The quiet stillness before a vow. The way your fingers intertwine. The joyful chaos of celebration. These are the moments that become legacy, and these are the moments I live to preserve. I’ve been photographing love since I was 18 years old, and every year deepens my passion. My style is cinematic and soulful, blending fine art composition with real, unfiltered emotion. I want your wedding day to feel like a scene from your favorite film, elegant, emotional, honest, and uniquely you. Whether you’re exchanging vows under a canopy of redwoods or dancing barefoot under the stars, I’m there to capture the feeling of it all. I live just north of San Francisco, where the natural beauty and incredible people constantly inspire me. I raised my son here, and at 20 years old, he remains one of my greatest inspirations. His love, wisdom, and heart remind me daily why this work matters, why love is worth pausing for, witnessing fully, and remembering forever. When I’m not behind the camera, I’m nurturing my other passion: storytelling within my community. I run two local magazines that celebrate the vibrant, real-life stories of the people who make this place home. I believe in honoring everyday magic, and that shows up in my photography, too. I love to travel, I love deep connections, and I love photographing couples who lead with love and live with intention. If that sounds like you, I’d be honored to help tell your story, one frame at a time. Let’s create something unforgettable.
