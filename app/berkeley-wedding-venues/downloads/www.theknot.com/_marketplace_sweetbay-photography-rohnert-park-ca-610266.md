Thanks to recommendations from couples on The Knot

Hi, I’m Opal. Are we a good match?! My ideal couple is a big fan of candid photos. You of course want some beautifully posed photos with your fiancé, but most importantly you want to truly enjoy your wedding day, keeping it a celebration and not turning it into an endless photo shoot. You do want timeless family portraits (and someone who can easily wrangle people around when needed), you really want lot of authentic fun candid moments captured. You need someone who stays calm and focused in the chaos of a wedding. You are afraid you may feel awkward in photos and need someone with some good direction and can make it feel effortless and fun. If that’s you, that’s me!!! As for me, I believe the most meaningful photos aren’t posed or staged—they’re the genuine, fleeting moments that happen naturally. My passion is to anticipate these moments and capture these precious memories for you. People love that I’m calm yet directive, professional and organized, Delivering sneak peeks and full wedding galleries very quickly. I am always easy to talk to. I return emails and calls right away—AND you can text me anytime. 707-628-6027 I’m like a new friend who just happens to be an amazing photographer.

Opal

Photographer, Mom, Wife and Dog Trainer :)

I live in Cotati and have been photographing weddings for 19 years. I started my business when my son was born. My son is a Trapeze Artist who is also studying Psychology and Photography in college. My grandpa was also a photographer. I am married to my soul mate; we have 3 fur babies. I love dogs, kids, music and poetry. The highlight of my career is all the kids that have come from all the weddings over the years. Kids that I get to photograph year after year. Keeping in touch with past wedding couples and photographing their lives moving forward makes me feel so grateful. My life's purpose :).

Additionally, her ability to direct people is outstanding - she does it in a way that is kind but also has great leadership/direction so that she captures all the best photos.

lly stood out to us was her professionalism—she was transparent with pricing, never overcharged, and never tried to upsell us on anything unnecessary. Despite it being a cold, foggy winter day, she somehow captured the most beautiful, magical shots. Her talent truly shines, no matter the conditions. On top of that, she was incredibly warm, welcoming, and calming, which made us feel so comfortable in front of the camera. As a fun bonus, we even learned she offers dog training services on the side—and honestly, after working with her, we’d trust her with just about anything! She is truly top-notch, and we highly recommend her to anyone looking for a talented, trustworthy, and wonderful photographer.

us prior to our wedding and she made our special day so awesome. When you get married, you spend the entire day with your photographer and Opal was so fun to hang with all day. She was great at posing us without making us feel awkward. She was also great at capturing candid and organic moments. She kept us on track and on time all day with a smile on her face the whole time, which isn't easy to do with my seven wild bridesmaids! She brought another photographer, Wing, who was just as easygoing and fun. We had her set up a photo booth for our reception and our guests had a blast taking pictures with all the fun props. Her husband ran the photo booth and was awesome. Our pictures turned out absolutely gorgeous and we got them back in just four weeks! I highly recommend Sweetbay Photography. Thank you Opal, for making our special day so much fun and capturing all of our favorite moments!

We had a small, 23 person destination wedding at St. Orres in Gualala, and booked Sweetbay to capture the weekend. Opal is super attentive, helpful, and responsive. Given that w...

e just had a family-only, small wedding, I didn’t bother with a coordinator, and hadn’t put much thought into wedding day timelines (total type B bride over here!), and by the end of my first phone call with Opal, I walked away with a whole organized schedule of events that she drafted for me! So fabulous. Prasanna was our photographer. She was an absolute doll—we loved working with her all weekend! Friday night we had everyone dress up in all denim for dinner and lawn games, and Prasanna got to know everyone and capture us in our less serious moments. By the time Saturday rolled around, she was already acquainted with everyone, which made our wedding day so natural and comfortable. Prasanna had some really cool photo ideas that we tried out, and I’m so glad we did (even if it meant being peeled away from the karaoke fun for a bit)! We got our photos back from Opal when we were on honeymoon, and my husband and I were sobbing going through all of them, reliving our magical weekend. Prasanna captured our entire family so perfectly—the tears of joy, the laughter, the goofiness, the beauty…As for the cool photo idea Prasanna suggested—it turned out incredible!! The only problem is that there are too many beautiful moments captured, I don’t know which ones to get blown up to hang in the house!! Of all the decisions to make when planning a wedding, trusting a photographer is a big one, and I’m so glad we went with Sweetbay and Prasanna!!

Bodega Bay Lodge, and after looking at her work and meeting up with her, we decided we wanted to work with Opal. I am so happy we did. Up until the wedding, Opal was so great answering our questions and helping us prepare. When the day came, I was so impressed with her. My husband and I were awkward when taking pictures and Opal stepped in right away, directing us and positioning us so that our pictures would turn out. Throughout the whole night, Opal was everywhere! When people were taking pictures, she would be right there to take a picture as well. Our guests commented on what a great job she did capturing our moments. Then we got the pictures and wow!! I could not believe how amazing they look. We have not even been able to choose which pictures we want because they all look so great. As we have distributed to our family, they too are blown away by the pictures. Besides the fantastic quality, Opal did such a great job capturing every single guest, including taking photographs for the couples who attended. I am so happy we decided to work with Opal and cannot recommend her enough. We will definitely work with her again!

She seemed to be everywhere all the time! She captured every moment so beautifully. We got so many amazing photos! We were absolutely thrilled with Opal and would highly recommend her !

We could rave about our experience with Opal and her team for hours! From beginning to end, our experience was a pleasure and seamless. She personalized her services to our needs a...

nd delivered way above our expectations. She was so personable, efficient and stepping in to help where we didn't know how to do something like helping button the thousands of buttons on the back of my dress to helping pin the boutonniere correctly on my husband. She caught so many natural shots and was very intuitive about what would work best in a shot. Plus, she was an expert at wrangling our big family to finish all the shots we wanted ahead of schedule. Plus, she got some priceless shots of our dog Billie that we will definitely be blowing up and framing. She got so many amazing shots of the day and captured all magic of the day. Wing was also amazing as our videographer. He was so unobtrusive and caught great moments. We almost forgot he was there he was so stealth. We love the videos and photos so much! Edwin did a fantastic job running the photo booth as well. We got so many fun shots of our friends and family enjoying the photo booth and all the props were such a hit. We would recommend Opal and her team without reservation. In fact, we'd get marry again tomorrow just to be able to hire her and her team to capture it for us! We cannot thank them enough for capturing one of the most important days of our lives!

We hired Opal and her team at Sweetbay Photography for the videography and photo booth at our wedding. They are WONDERFUL!! Extremely communicative, professional, and super nice!...

Our guests LOVED the photo booth and Opal even sent us home with a beautiful album with pasted photo booth photos and love messages written by our guests which was such a special treat to get to see immediately after our wedding day! We received our highlight reel and full video footage on an engraved drive just a few weeks later that also arrived in an engraved wooden box. The video is ABSOLUTELY beautiful!! Wing, the videographer, captured everything we could have hoped for using multiple cameras for different angles and the quality is incredibly professional. We felt like we were watching a rom-com!! It was really magical. Thank you, Sweetbay for EVERYTHING you did for us and for giving us the ability to look back at these beautiful memories for the rest of our lives!

Having Opal as our wedding photographer ended up being one of the highlights of our planning process and our big day! She is not only an incredibly talented photographer, but Opal ...

was also a joy to work with from start to finish. I found Opal via research on The Knot. I loved her Web site portfolio, so I reached out - she very promptly responded and offered her availability to have a phone conversation. I found Opal to be knowledgable, passionate, empathetic and a great listener - I knew from that conversation that we'd found our photographer! After that, Opal made it very easy from an administrative perspective to sign a contract and make payment. Several months before the wedding, Opal met my fiancé and I at our venue so that she could get to know us in person and get the lay of the land in order to plan her strategy for how she would best use her time on our wedding day. We walked away from that meeting feeling so confident and happy that we'd have the privilege of being photographed by such a pro. On our big day, Opal arrived early and ready to go! She made my fiancé, myself and our friends & family instantly comfortable - all of our guests who interacted with Opal that day felt exactly the same way we did about her. She was so professional and struck the perfect balance of providing gentle direction and also blending right in. There were moments I forgot there was even a photographer with us! Opal sent us the link to our gallery in less than a week and the photographs far exceeded my expectations. I had said in our first conversation that our biggest desire was to capture the spirit of our favorite people being together and enjoying each other - Opal beyond delivered on that vision and so much more! Aside from the amazing candids that were our primary goal, she also ensured we had more traditional portraits of us with our families and of just my husband & I as well. I cried (tears of happiness!) the first time I looked through the photos. They perfectly capture the many emotions of the day. Opal's photographs are going to remain a source of pure joy for my husband, myself, and our loved ones for many years to come. If I could give Opal 100 stars I would!

ltation until our big day. She made us feel so comfortable during the photo shoots that it felt easy to relax and really get some great photos taken. Our pictures turned out amazing and I couldn’t have asked for a better experience! She knew exactly where to have everyone stand and even her candid photos during the reception really captured the magic of the day. I would recommend her to anyone and have personally recommended her to a few friends. The pictures from the big day came back much more quickly than we were expecting. Thank you again Opal and Vinh!

The day before our big day, her and her team visited the venue to go over last minute touches, look at the venue for picture perfect spots. It was all so seamless. The day of our wedding the photobooth was a big hit, the actual photographer was amazing! She received so many complements. She even was assisting to mine and my husbands needs for the day, constantly checking in on us. Just amazing-above and beyond. Then literally a month later, we received our photos that we have access to for a YEAR! Opal's prices are so reasonable and does amazing work, deserves every penny! I recommend her for all your pictures. I will be keeping her contact information.

We were very happy with the photographs and all the wonderful memories of that day that these photos bring.

as extremely prompt and easy going. Opal showed up 30 minutes early before coverage was set to begin to scope out the venue and was fully prepared to begin right at the time we had set. The venue was extremely windy, so much so that one of the large vases we had completely shattered. But the high wind situation was not a problem for Opal. She handled it with such professionalism and captured shots where our hair seemed to blow perfectly in the wind. During the ceremony we hardly even noticed her. But somehow when we received the photos, she had managed to get photos from every single angle. After the ceremony, Opal was quick and efficient with directing the party for family photos. Knowing that we had a short window booked, she made sure to fully utilize the time we had and returned to us a generous amount of photos. We not only appreciated the quantity but also the quality of the photos. There were so many emotions captured, it really helps us relive the day. Without us mentioning anything Opal realized that the photos were potentially time-sensitive and she made it her priority to return us the photos asap. For that, we are forever grateful. Book Opal if you want someone that is: \- professional \- stealthy \- thorough \- accommodating \- easy going \- thoughtful

The photos were delivered quickly, and honestly, there was not a bad one in the bunch. She even identified some selects and converted them to black and white, which was really striking.
