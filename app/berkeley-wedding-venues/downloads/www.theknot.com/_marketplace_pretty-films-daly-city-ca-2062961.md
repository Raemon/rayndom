They didn’t miss a single moment not my dad’s proud smile, not our first dance stumble, not the way my husband looked at me. This film is our greatest treasure.

3/07/2025 • Kellie W

I’m still in shock at how amazing our wedding video is! Pretty Films captured every moment so perfectly. It’s like they bottled up all the love and happiness from our day.

2/21/2025 • Star G

Pretty Films is a dream team! They’re so talented and professional. Our wedding video is stunning, and we’re so happy we chose them to capture our day.

Pretty Films made our day look like a romantic comedy (but better!). They captured all the big moments, the small moments, and the ridiculous moments. 5 stars!

Our wedding video is like a fairy tale. The videographer did an amazing job capturing all the love and joy of our big day.

1/02/2024 • Noah S

Overall, had a pretty poor experience with Pretty Films. For starters, they act as a broker. They pair random videographers with equally random editors and the result is relatively...

non-cohesive film. Their examples shown here are not descriptive of their work. Secondly, Pretty Films upcharged us (twice) for additional time spent with the videographer. That said, the videographer lost all the footage, or Pretty Films did, or their hired editor did, because we got neither raw nor edited versions of footage we explicitly took extra time to ask for. We went back to the project coordinator for a refund, and we have spent about 2-3 months trying to get that refund to no avail. Pretty disappointed. Wish we'd just opted for a more expensive, higher quality option.

11/21/2022 • Mikaela M

We had a small, straightforward wedding and initially weren't going to hire a videographer, but my husband convinced me that this would be a unique opportunity because he knew how ...

much I wanted nice videos of us. As a result, we started looking for a videographer and discovered Alena of Pretty Films. We decided on a small package because Alena was so kind and sincere during our phone conversation. Alena also photographed the event. She arrived earlier than we anticipated, was cordial, and patient with all the commotion. She recorded the event in stunning videos. was courteous, sincere, and professional. If we ever need professional videographers, we will most certainly use them.

Maribel of Pretty Films was a fantastic find for us. She has an excellent sense of what works. I've seen our highlight film a lot of times, but not as frequently as my mother has. ...

She seems to have perfectly captured the mood of the occasion as well as the joy and love that our wedding brought. Maribel went above and above, and I have a sneaking suspicion that I don't even know all the ways she did it. I do know, however, that she placed twinkle lights on the bride and groom table during the reception, and the result was ethereal.
