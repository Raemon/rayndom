e had great communication and reasonable prices. Amy herself was booked for the day we needed, but she arranged for three of her assistants to help our group. All three artists arrived on time at Caza Hotel and did a great job. Daisy worked on the mothers, junior bridesmaid and flower girl - she was so pleasant and did great work on our hair and makeup. My makeup/hair lasted from 10am until 11pm that day! Daisy listened to exactly what we wanted. Kat was the main artist working with the bride for trial and day of wedding - Natalia was super happy with her work! Carina joined Kat in helping with hair/makeup for the other five adult bridesmaids. Everyone was happy with how they looked and loved the ladies/experience. Would highly recommend working with Amy for your wedding day hair and makeup needs!

Amy was an absolute joy to work with. She was a recommendation from a friend, and when I initially reached out to her, she was professional, prompt, and even offered to do a phone ...

call with me so we could get a feel for each other. I don’t typically wear much makeup and I’ve had… mediocre experiences with wedding makeup in the past as part of the bridal party. I voiced these concerns to Amy during my trial, and together we came up with a game plan for a look that made me feel gorgeous while still looking like me. On the Big Day, Amy and her second makeup artist were on-time and simply flew through all the bridesmaids. We were ahead of the timeline the whole morning, which helped start the day on a more relaxing note. I was thrilled with my final look; my hair and makeup lasted literally all night, except for the lip gloss (which is normal, and she provided a touch up for, which was perfect!). I truly can’t recommend Amy enough for future brides!

had my hair/make up trial, and I was not sure if I wanted it half up/down or all up, and she said she would try both. It was really great of her to do that and I am glad I tried both because that swayed my decision. She recommended lipstick for the special day, and my mom and I both got the same lipstick! I loved my trial; however, I ended up wanting to go with braids and Amy was very accommodating and I loved my hair WAY more than my trial, so it really worked out that I spoke up. Amy was also very flexible with timing. We needed to start earlier, and she said it would not be an issue and she showed up right on time. My bridesmaids and my mom looked amazing and I would definitely recommend Amy and her team for your special day.

t nervous, but Amy delivered exactly what I was looking for. The makeup felt so light on my skin but still looked incredible in pictures. She was also just super nice, low-key, and enjoyable to be around on the wedding morning as we got ready. We weren't rushed at all, and everyone loved their looks! And her prices were the best I found!

Amy did a fantastic job with my and my bridesmaids’ hair and makeup! We actually worked with her two years in a row because my husband tested positive for COVID the day before our ...

wedding, so we still got married but postponed our reception to a year later. In spite of the circumstances, Amy was very accommodating and willing to do hair and makeup for us on my wedding day, and I am so grateful for her flexibility! We loved her so much that we asked if she could do our hair and makeup again this year for the reception. She did a stunning job, and in spite of the ~95F weather, my makeup lasted the whole day! Would highly recommend her :)

She was even so sweet to pick me up a latte on the way to the venue! 😭 Thank you Amy, for making my family feel and look so beautiful for my wedding!

Amy and her assistant did wedding make up and hair for me, my mom, and six bridesmaids. She was very open to feedback after our trial and maintained prompt and clear communication ...

from booking to the actual big day. I liked that she uses individual lashes (instead of strip) because my overall makeup look stayed put even after a couple of lashes fell off from all the joyful tears. Our whole group looked so good thanks to Amy and her team!

If you're looking for an experienced, friendly professional to do your hair and makeup, I highly recommend Amy S! As someone who doesn't usually wear that much makeup I was nervous...

about the look and feel of everything for my wedding day. During the trial Amy made me feel comfortable and walked me through my options and made really helpful recommendations. She was also super communicative throughout the whole process and I never had to wait long at all for her to answer a question I had. She was very punctual and prepared, and on the big day she even finished my hair and makeup early which allowed me to do some extra photos with my bridesmaids. The makeup looked fantastic, I didn't ever feel like I was wearing heavy makeup at all, and it lasted all day. All in all, my experience working with her could not have been better and I'd highly recommend her to anyone.

wedding day. Amy showed up early to set up and was able to manage scheduled appointments perfectly as well as accommodate last minute changes (which was such a relief! when my aunt-in-law from overseas wanted to get some services done for the wedding). Amy and her assistant, Daisy, made my girls feel comfortable asking for small changes to their day-of look and her flexibility didn't go unnoticed. When I sat in the chair on my wedding day I got a huge adrenaline rush and Amy's calmness truly set the tone for the room. I can't thank Amy enough for her work and professionalism on my wedding day - she exceeded my expectations by far. Thank you again for making me feel flawless :)

I’m a little biased because Amy is family, but her work speaks for itself! She did my hair & makeup for my wedding and my bridesmaids hair as well, and we got sooo many compliments...
