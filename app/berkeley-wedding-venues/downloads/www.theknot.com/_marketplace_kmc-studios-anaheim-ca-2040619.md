Kameron was so easy to work with. We decided at the last minute that we wanted a videographer after all and Kameron was able to accommodate all of our requests. We only wanted spec...

ific footage, and Kameron worked with us to create a custom package. Kameron and his crew were true pros - we got excellent footage of everything we wanted, with no day-of disruptions, allowing us to be fully in the moment. We really love how the videos turned out. The highlight reel especially captured the day beautifully in a bite size chunk. All in all, Kameron was wonderful to work with and we would highly recommend him!

The team at KMC was punctual. They supported us with the entire process of all the things to expect day of the wedding. KMC captured some of the most memorable moments and we will ...

always be grateful to them. I highly recommend their service. Our guests commented on how professional the online zoom viewing was and some even said they felt like they were right there with us. And this meant the world to us given we got married during the pandemic and chose not to have our friends and family for a large wedding. We love our edited highlight reel.

Kameron and his team were our wedding videographers. He was very communicative via text before our wedding and asked to view our venue so that he could be fully prepared on the day...

. On the day of our wedding, he showed up on time and did a wonderful job with our livestream of our wedding. Our relatives in India were able to enjoy our wedding due to his fantastic livestream. He captured our wedding from multiple angles in the livestream and was able to have it available through YouTube. Our highlight reel captured all of the important moments from our wedding/reception and the longer edited video of our reception nicely captured all of the speeches and dances and important moments. The custom USB was so beautiful! It had our names engraved on it and it was a beautiful rose gold color. Our highlight reel and longer edited video did take about 7 weeks after our wedding to receive instead of the 4 weeks that we were originally told. But the quality of the videos was fantastic. And Kameron provided us links to download all videos so that we can watch them anytime. Thank you so much, KMC Studios, for the amazing videography of our wedding/reception! We will cherish them forever.
