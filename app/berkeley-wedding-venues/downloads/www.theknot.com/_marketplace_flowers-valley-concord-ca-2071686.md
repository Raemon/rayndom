wer vendor, working with Flowers Valley allowed us to focus on the excitement of planning our wedding knowing that we were in the best hands, and that in and of itself made our experience with Flowers Valley invaluable! Our wedding flowers perfectly encapsulated our vision—from the bouquet shape, colors and types of flowers—for a winter wedding. Flowers Valley’s process in understanding our vision for the floral decorations felt so seamless from beginning to end. We felt so supported throughout the entire process communicating with Karina, who was very helpful in presenting us with sample bouquets and decorations based on our vision, and showed us alternative flowers when a flower that we wanted wasn't in season. She answered any questions we had with promptness and passion for our project, and we felt confident every step of the way. It was so amazing to have Flowers Valley create the flowers for our entrance sign, tables setting, aisle arch, bouquets and boutonnières, and seeing everything come together on our wedding day could not have been more magical. We would highly recommend Flowers Valley to all our friends and family for all of life’s special events!

Wow! Karina and the Flowers Valley team were incredible. I was completely stunned the day of the wedding when I first saw the floral arrangements. I truly could not believe how bea...

utiful and perfect they were and I was in disbelief that these were OUR wedding flowers. I think I said “I can’t believe how perfect the flowers are” at least 6 times during the wedding. First, Karina and team were a delight to work with. We had several calls to review the vision and a few renditions of the proposal to get it just right. Additionally, the night before the wedding she sent me a picture of my bouquet and I was able to make tweaks and suggestions which resulted in the most perfect bouquet and exactly what I wanted. The attention to detail was perfect. They incorporated every flower I wanted, omitted the ones I didn’t, understood the vision and executed perfect. As a very type A control Bride, i wholeheartedly would recommend the Flowers Valley team and I would 110% work with them again for any future flower needs. THANK YOU Karina and Team!

llowed me to make changes to my bridal bouquet the day before so that it was perfect. Some things were pricier than I thought but they had some flexibility in choosing between fresh and faux flowers to match my budget. Also I chose a design that was meant to go from the ceremony to sweetheart table and they helped to coordinate the move and clean up. It was such a stunning design. The beautiful photos are from our photographer Sahleen Studios!
