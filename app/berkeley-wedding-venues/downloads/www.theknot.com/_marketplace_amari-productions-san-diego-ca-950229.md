Thanks to recommendations from couples on The Knot

As we see it, your job is to remain focused on each other, your loved ones, and why you're there. After all, when you're fully present, we get the best content.

And then we capture them in a real and genuine way, so when you look back you'll truly feel like you. “To be honest, I barely noticed they were there and I mean that in the best way! They incorporated themselves with the guests without being too in your face with the camera.” - Kim & Laeth A NATURAL CONNECTION Some couples want their photographers and filmmakers to be an extension of their bridal party and other times they want them to fade into the background. With us, you have a team who knows when to step in and out of each role. Feeling nervous and need a hype team at the beginning of your day? We'll crush it. Need some help on what to do with your hands? Just call us Obi-Wan [Ed. note: apologies for showing our nerd]. Want to dance the night away with your best friends? We'll disappear from your line of vision. And we do it all with that warm, easygoing personality you would find in a close friend. “The final product was insane! We have no idea how they so beautifully and perfectly tied the whole day up into a 6 minute video. It brings us back immediately to that day. Booking Amari was one of the best decisions we could have made! We are forever grateful!” - Emily COMMISSION US TO CAPTURE YOUR VISION When it comes to your wedding day, you have the final say. While we offer insight and guidance, this day is about you and your vision. This is your chance to commission real artists to create truly stunning imagery featuring the best day of your life. After you inquire we will get on the phone with you and listen to every detail of the vibe you're going for.

Through carefully curated music, sound, and truly impactful imagery- exactly the way you envisioned it, and maybe even better. “They were by far our favorite vendor of our wedding. From the very first phone call we had with them, to getting our final video, it has all been amazing.” - Mackenzie Let's connect - we're ready when you are!

David McQueen

Co-Founder

From the first day I was introduced to wedding photo & video, I was absolutely enthralled. Here was a profession where people would commission you to create art for them - documenting the most special day of their lives - creating family heirlooms that they and their loved ones would cherish forever. I could not believe it was a real job, and one that you could make a career out of! So, after spending a few years apprenticing with other studios, my wife and I founded Amari Productions in 2011. It has been my passion project ever since! One immediate change I wanted to bring to our industry was to break the model of having a single team, whose price would raise exponentially with experience. As someone who’s always loved to teach & coach, and who’s passionate about the art form of our storytelling, I saw an opportunity to build a team, and to pass on what I had learned to my fellow creatives. Fifteen years later, and our unique model has allowed us to bring together so many stakeholders - our family of creatives who have a place to call home & make art, our couples who can expect luxury level experience and quality at a fraction of the cost, and my wife and I - who over time have been able to start a family and have our weekends to be with our kids, all while nurturing this amazing team.

We cannot say enough wonderful things about Amari Productions—they were truly one of the best decisions we made for our wedding day! From the very beginning, their team was the per...

fect combination of professional, flexible, and incredibly supportive. They made the entire process seamless and stress-free, which is no small feat when it comes to planning a wedding. Will, our lead photographer, and Nick, our lead videographer, were phenomenal. Not only are they both exceptionally talented, but they also took the time to understand what moments were most important to us. They made sure to capture every single special detail—without ever feeling intrusive or rushed. What really stood out was how Will and Nick prioritized our experience. They ensured we got all the shots we wanted, but also gave us the freedom to truly enjoy our celebration. Because of them, we were able to maximize our time on the dance floor while knowing all the magic was being captured behind the scenes. Even though we haven’t received our full gallery or final video yet, the sneak peek photos alone have absolutely blown us away. The emotion, joy, and atmosphere they managed to capture in just a handful of images have left us counting the days until we see the rest. Working with Amari was a breeze—communication was always prompt, clear, and friendly. Their pricing felt incredibly fair for the quality of service and product they provide. It’s rare to find a team that delivers on every level, but Amari absolutely does. We would hire them again in a heartbeat. If you’re looking for a team that is not only skilled but also genuinely wonderful to be around, look no further. Amari Productions helped make our day unforgettable, and we’re endlessly grateful. Thank you, Amari! You’re the real MVPs.

We worked with Em from Amari Productions for our wedding at the Adamson House in August. She was awesome. She had a great eye for both posed and candid shots across the entirety of...

our event, and captured all of the best moments beautifully. She balanced great coverage without ever being disruptive or in the way. When directing posed photos of my wife and I or the larger group photos, she was direct and professional but not terse, which kept the proverbial train moving efficiently while we enjoyed the shoot. Amari pricing was fair and we got our photos quickly after the event. We're so glad we went with Amari!

It gave us so much confidence going into the day knowing they were on the same page and we got the finer details sorted well ahead of time. On our wedding day, the Amari team completely exceeded expectations. They were professional but relaxed, creative but never overbearing — the perfect balance. Our lead, Sage, was incredible. He connected with our guests so naturally and the team made everyone feel at ease, as if they were part of the celebration. You could feel that the entire Amari team genuinely cared about making the day special, not just capturing it. When we got our photos and films back, we were speechless. They didn’t just record what happened — they truly captured how it felt. Every emotion, every laugh, every quiet moment was brought back to life in such a thoughtful, cinematic way. These are memories we’ll carry forever, and we’re so grateful to Amari for preserving them so beautifully. Thank you so much!

We loved Amari Photo for our wedding day! We did a lot of research on vendors but we found that they had a reasonable price and when we talked to them, they really radiated lots of...

experience but also a warmth that they wanted to help make our day special and memorable. We appreciated that they asked us how we wanted to take photos and were so willing to work with us on our schedule. They had a really wonderful price with excellent quality and quantity of photos. We would highly recommend doing an engagement shoot with them if you're able to as it helps you ease up for the big day (wedding). They are so efficient and help organize a lot of the group photos on wedding day and will get all the family/friends/portrait shots you want. They also help with running the schedule even though it's not in their job description - but they really do make an effort to know your schedule to help you. If you're more easygoing, they have many recommendations and will still help you get the most memorable and quality shots you will like! All the staff is incredibly friendly and in a stressful season of wedding planning - they really help ease that tension and make it so that you're not worried about the photography process at all! They returned photos quickly with so many photos that helped capture a lot of the day that us (bride and groom) didn't see, but all their photos were excellent quality and helped us relive one of the best days of our lives!

We spent a lot of time reading reviews and browsing photos before our wedding, and ultimately chose Amari because their work stood out as our favorite. Unfortunately, the photos we...

received fell short of expectations. There wasn’t a single well-composed photo of my husband and me looking at the camera together, the bridal portraits lacked the attention and quality given to the groom's headshots, and some of the photos selected for the website were unflattering. It’s disheartening to have invested so much in capturing such a special day, only to receive a gallery that felt largely underwhelming.

Response from Amari Productions on 07/07/2025

Hi Carson, this is Dave - co-founder of Amari, alongside my wife. First and foremost, know...

that we are very saddened and deeply sorry to hear that you had anything less than a perfect delivery experience. I only wish we had known earlier, so we could have helped right away. As soon as we read your review, we reached out to better understand your concerns, so that we could immediately start working to make it right. I appreciate you taking the time to connect with us and share more specifics. From that conversation, we heard two main concerns: (1) You were hoping for more couples portraits with you both looking directly at the camera. (2) You noticed a difference in the number and variety of solo portraits of you compared to Dylan. With it being a Sunday on a holiday weekend, it will take me a day or so to connect with the rest of the team, but I wanted to make sure I got back to you the same day with a progress note of where we’re at. For your couples portraits, I see that while there are a lot in your gallery - most reflect our more natural, candid style. That said, I do see about 10 or so in the mix where you’re both looking directly at the camera in different settings. Knowing now that classic, posed style means a lot to you, I will have the team group those into a new section for easy viewing. I’ll also have our team pull more photos in that style to edit additional options for you two. On the Solo Portraits, I see that Dylan currently has more photos in your gallery from the additional time he had before first look - while you were still getting into your dress. That said, it’s completely fair to want more balance. I’ll personally work with our team this week to edit and add more of your solo bridal portraits, so the final gallery reflects you both equally. That’s everything the team and I have accomplished today, and I will continue to keep in touch as we work through these updates. I’m also going to email you my personal cell phone number, so that you can reach me anytime - call or text. We care deeply about our couples, Carson, and we’re here to make sure you’re truly in love with your photos!

We were so very happy we ended up going with Amari for our videography services of our wedding. Like most couples we had been weighing budget against what we wanted out of our day ...

and what it came down to was that photography was our priority, but we still wanted to have video. We came across Amari thinking they would just be there to capture the day to remember, but not expecting anything crazy. We are so happy we made that decision. Not only were they very helpful in the planning process, but the day of they were professional, made us feel comfortable, and provided us with a great final product. Also, we were really looking to have the raw content so that was a bonus that they allowed for that too. We ended up going with the slightly more expensive option and it was worth every penny because George was awesome. He met with us before to talk about our goals, expectations, what content we would really like to see, and ran through the day of timeline so there were no surprises. If you are on the fence, get the videographer, and go with Amari.

We had a wonderful experience working with Amari Productions for our wedding videography. We got the package that included a sneak peak and 25 minute full length video. Everything ...

from the initial interview through the video customization process was such smooth sailing, and it really felt like a collaborative effort. I appreciated the number of examples available to peruse, and the forms used to pin down our style and preference for the videos were clear and easy to use. In a whirlwind of wedding decisions and logistics, we never worried about Amari providing anything other than a beautiful video. I also loved how we were provided all of the raw footage/audio as well - as a bit of a control freak it was great for me to feel like I wasn’t missing a second of the records of the day! And this way, I have the full audio/video of things like first dance, processional song (played live), etc. Would highly recommend Amari. Great team, smooth sailing all the way through, and a finished video that even made my dad choke up! What a wonderful way to relive the day forever.

ked great. We ordered the standard package, plus the ceremony edit and I cannot recommend getting the ceremony edit enough. It is so special to watch our ceremony unfold, since you'll never remember every little detail of such a big moment in life. I honestly was on the fence about getting a videographer since photography was our biggest priority and now I think video is a must. There's nothing like being able to watch how things really unfolded - all the words said, reactions, and funny little moments too. If you want a great budget option that does not skimp on quality with a team who will blend seamlessly into the background, Amari is a great choice!

ement shoot and wedding day photos, has a real talent for making you feel at ease in front of the camera. He captured our essence perfectly, striking that ideal balance between natural moments and expertly posed shots. He knew exactly how to bring out our best selves! Alec's eye for those magical sunset photos is unreal. The shots he got during the golden hour are seriously frame-worthy. Sebby was also a total pro with the video camera and equipment. What really blew us away was their incredible work ethic. These guys didn't just clock in and out - they stayed extra to capture those priceless moments of us dancing with our guests. Throughout the whole process, we felt so comfortable with them. It was like hanging out with old friends who just happened to have professional-grade cameras. They knew exactly how to guide us without making anything feel forced or awkward. If you're looking for a photography and videography team that'll make you feel like a million bucks AND deliver stunning results, look no further than Sage, Alec, and Sebby.

Amari was 100% the right choice. The guys (led by Matt) were on-purpose and professional — and completely blended into the background on our wedding day. They rolled with last-minu...

te schedule changes and still got so many incredible shots that I hoped they could/would (on both the handheld cams and drone). They nailed the angles and overall feeling we wanted, and then the editing team crafted a beautiful and heartwarming wedding video for us less than two months later. Amari was reasonably priced and the entire team was easy to work with throughout the planning process. They definitely understood and carried out our vision. We can’t thank them enough.

We got married a couple months ago and recently got our highlight video. After my husband and I watched it for the first time together, we looked at each other almost in awe and th...

en he said, "wanna watch it again?!" After we watched it a second time, we watched our ceremony video, then the video of the speeches (both great too)... then we watched the highlight video a THIRD time! Amari has a couple forms to fill out before the event, so I wrote up notes about music, voice overs, cinematography, etc. Their team truly read everything I wrote, took that into account in their editing, and delivered BEYOND what I could have imagined. We are so, so, so, so happy with it. It was AMAZING. It captured so much of us and our day, and we were filled with love and wonder watching it. We also had such a great experience with the team on our wedding day. They were very kind and enjoyable to be around, which is so important. We appreciate all your work, Amari Productions-- we LOVE IT!

The Amari Productions team is pure magic. They are bonafide pros when it comes to filming the right angles, making the right edits, and capturing the right moments. When my wife...

(then fiancée) and I were hunting for wedding videographers, we saw quite a few prior to Amari. But once we stumbled upon their work, we were sold. We knew they'd do a great job. But they exceeded our already high expectations. They really know how to fit your exact style and preferences. Besides from being experts at their craft, they are also great people. George worked with us on our wedding day, and he's such a gem. He's kind, warm, caring, and not the least bit intrusive. We were so happy to have him there behind the camera. Amari is the without a doubt a 5/5 star production team. Do not think twice about hiring them for your event!

Amari was so great, we absolutely loved working with them, they really listened to what we wanted and when we wanted the first version tweaked, they were open and receptive to what...

we wanted, even though the first version was amazing. I think how they treat you after it is "done" also says a lot about a company. They were very professional, punctual, and caught moments I didn't even know happened! I would recommend Amari to my best friends and family because they built trust and delivered a quality product that will last a lifetime. We are NOT an easy couple to please either. We were between two really high rated and respected videographers and we decided on Amari because of the "feel" of their videos being more light and fun than the other. We had a multi-day Indian wedding and we really liked how all the footage turned out. Make sure you get the toast edit! We didn't initially but luckily we could add it on after the fact. It is amazing to go back and relive a day that went by in such a blur. Amari Productions is amazing and I highly recommend them!

He was literally on the ground in the dirt videoing us as we took pictures under some twinkle lights. We are on pins and needles waiting for our final videos, edits and raw footage (they are running behind schedule, so if you hire them, don't expect the final product to be ready within the contract terms). I would absolutely hire them again!

My fiancé and I were not sure about hiring a videographer for our wedding initially — there is so much else, already, to figure out! — but my parents insisted we'd regret it if we ...

didn't. And I have to say, they were right! When it finally arrived, the whole day felt like it elapsed on 2X speed, and I was so relieved to know afterward that we'd have video footage to watch back and remember it all by. When we agreed to book a videographer, my fiancé and I had two goals: first, that we wouldn't even know they were there, and second, that everything captured would be real, natural and unscripted. Amari very clearly was aligned with us on that from the outset, and I felt confident in hiring them. I loved that they sent around a detailed questionnaire in advance, to make sure they capture everything that is important to you and to find out about any significant moments or surprises planned throughout the day. I also loved that they followed up right after the wedding to ask the same things, in case your answers had changed. They were super easy to work with from beginning to end. I added on a feature to our package after the wedding, and that was a cinch. I gave some feedback about one of the videos, and they were very receptive to changing it. And during the wedding day itself, both Shaunie and Lauren were great to work with. It was so fun to receive the highlight film and ceremony edit, but also just to look back through the raw footage and see the little moments we missed throughout the day. I highly recommend hiring Amari! They are top notch.

ther forever," which made loosening up for the camera so much easier. My husband and I aren't the best in front of the camera/ center of attention type people and they made it effortless and natural. My dad is a photographer and personally picked Amari over others, because instead of "artsy" "trendy" pictures like a lot of LA wedding photographers, they're all about capturing real, sweet moments, and the energy of the room, which is exactly what we wanted. Megan was an absolute dream -- she's so incredibly talented, but also just as a person she made our wedding day even more fun. Also, the price point should not be ignored -- they were definitely on the budget side, but quality-wise I think they exceeded all the more expensive options. Also also, the video team sent us the raw footage, so we can look at all of the wedding footage, the ceremony, etc. Thanks so much to Megan and the whole Amari team, we're in love with our photos and video.

Amari is amazing!!!! I am from San Diego but got married in New York and had them come from San Diego because I had seen their work and loved it. They were incredibly professional ...

yet also so fun. They made everything so calm and were not annoying at all about taking photos, etc. They were like our friends on the day of the wedding!!! They make everything very low stress. I have received a couple of films from them already and cannot stress enough how amazing they are!! Their work is beautiful. I used them for both photography and videography and would 100% recommend anyone to use them. Even if they have to travel! Their videos and photos are stunning.

Words cannot express the emotions, memories, and love that was shared when we first watched our wedding feature film together. The team met everything that was asked for on the que...

stionnaire and exceeded our expectations! We cannot wait to watch and share this video for years to come. Let’s start at the beginning. When I first started looking for videographers to capture our special day, Amari stood out with their mission statement, multiple amazing reviews, and large collection of diverse videos. When I had the phone consultation, I was even more intrigued by the idea that we could play a part in the edits for our film. As our special day approached, I was so nervous that I would notice the cameras around us, but that was far from the truth. The team did such a great job on the day of to not only, help us relax when were too nervous and tense or when things didn’t go as planned (as they always will), but also to help us and our bridal party have fun, be ourselves, and enjoy our day without the pressure of having to “pose for the camera.” I cannot thank the Amari team for the huge support and love they showed us from the moment of that phone consolation to even after our wedding when we received our film. I will forever recommend (and hire!) Amari Productions, and you should too!

I can be an indecisive person, but making the choice to have them as my videographer was one of the easiest out of my whole wedding planning process! Not to mention, after I binge watched all of their videos and youtube posts, I was even more sold! They have already sent over my social media preview and I've watched it 30 times, while crying all over again every single time lol. If a 60 second video can impact me like that, I cannot WAIT to see the other videos to come! I can go on and on about how wonderful Amari Productions is, but all I can say is book them immediately, you will not regret it!!!

il and work they put in both before and after the wedding to make sure all the moments you want to be reflected in the final product are captured. Prior to the wedding, they provided us a questionnaire with everything we wanted to make sure we got on film (i.e. any detail shots, any editing preferences, the song choice). After the wedding, they also asked us if there was anything else we wanted to include prior to them starting on the editing of our film. When we got our highlight film, we were floored at just how great all the footage and editing was. Everything came out so beautiful and it really stayed true to the essence of what that day meant for us and for our families. Amari Productions was also our photographer for the wedding and they did such an incredible job at not only capturing everything we wanted, but they captured really great candid ones too. In addition, they were also very polite and professional. We’re so glad we invested in such an amazing videographer/photographer to capture such a special day for us. Highly recommend! Thank you again Amari Productions!

We actually loved our highlight video so much that we’re having them create a feature film for us too! Our cinematographers, David & Jaan Carlo, were an absolute pleasure to work with. They were kind, polite, professional, and fun to be around! Both were flexible to unexpected delays to our timeline and they worked really well alongside our other vendors (especially our photography team John DeFiora Photography) to make our big day a success!

I had the pleasure to work with Britt leading up to the wedding and it was the best experience! She is so incredible and just a joy! Day of the wedding the whole production team was so outstanding, they were fun, knowledgable, and really made us all feel so comfortable! We were beyond grateful to get to work with such awesome people and I could not have asked for a better team to be apart of our big day! They were on top of everything and so fully invested in making our wedding perfect. Some of the true magic was when we received our wedding video! I work in Events and I have never seen a better production then theirs. I hope to convey the amount of beauty and expertise that went into this film being produced. The team outdid themselves!! In all seriousness, our day was made because the Amari team was able to capture and present our wedding exactly how we had always imagined it! Our wedding would not have been the same without them all and we are so grateful to have had the opportunity it work with such an outstanding team!

My husband and I can truly not say enough great things about Amari Productions. They were by far our favorite vendor of our wedding. From the very first phone call we had with them...

, to getting our final video, it has all been amazing. Everyone you talk to is so incredibly nice and our videographers were an absolute blast! Everyone at our wedding loved them. They make the process so easy and make sure you are getting everything you want out of the videography. They stay in communication with you constantly which is something not all wedding vendors do. We have received so many compliments about how amazing our videos are, which makes sense because they are amazing! Lol Between our family, friends and ourselves we have watched them a million times. We hope to have them do all major events for our families from here on out. We are in Kansas and were a little worried about them being based out of California but it was not an issue at all! We recommend them 1,000% You will not be be disappointed.

the very beginning of the pandemic when everything was so uncertain (and when we all thought, "Oh yeah, it'll go back to normal in the late summer, right?"). Needless to say, Amari was professional and flexible. And even in my moments of "frantic bride-ism," Aaron and Britt helped us figure things out. A little about the team that we worked with: Aaron was welcoming and spent a lot of time with me on the phone when I first called to inquire. As you all know, the wedding industry is intimidating, and Aaron made us feel comfortable and listened to. After we signed, Britt came on and was involved in all the emails and planning throughout the year. What can I say, she is so positive, cheerful, fun, and personable! Our shooters were Magdalena and David, both so friendly, sweet, and professional! Everyone we had contact with on the Amari team are the type of people you'd be friends with. Down to earth. Our original 120 guest wedding at our dream venue in La Jolla ended up being a 22 person intimate ceremony and dinner. one thing we knew for sure was that we didn't want to postpone the videography for a postponed party, but wanted to capture the day we got married. I was worried how the video would end up with such a small wedding, but Amari captured the fun and love of our day better than I could've hoped for. Their work is beautiful, not only with the shots taken, but with how they capture the connections and special moments of the day. I am so grateful, thank you Amari!

timelines, plans and wedding venue. Amari was able to accommodate with ease. I appreciate the phone conversation to introduce themselves. Closer to the wedding, I had to fill out a series of questions and surveys to help them understand my style and taste. I watched their past clients to see which films I preferred, and which films I didn't. This is the best because my highlight film was EXACTLY what I had imagined. Shout out to Britt who responds to every email with professionalism and kindness. On the day of the wedding they were professional and respectful due to all the regulations we had. They captured everything, ninja style! All videographers did a phenomenal job and they were a pleasure to be around. I have now been a part of two Amari Production films and I'm telling you, they do a fabulous job. My husband did not want to pay for a videographer and thank gosh we did! It was one of the best decisions of my wedding.
