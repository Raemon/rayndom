Alena and her husband Alex are absolutely phenomenal. Of all the vendors we spoke with (ring makers, food vendors, florists, tailors, photographers, videographers, etc) Alena was t...

he most responsive and accommodating of our vision. As evidenced by her stunning portfolio, she is extremely gifted at capturing a natural and yet modern elegance in her photography, which was exactly what we were looking for. Alena had some fantastic suggestions for where we could take engagement photos. She was extremely generous with her time, accompanying us to three separate locations on that shoot in order to maximize the breadth and style of photos. We were able to take some epic photos that we are extremely happy with. We are a couple that is not the most comfortable posing in front of the camera but Alena made it feel very casual and fun. On the day of the wedding, Alena and Alex were extremely supportive and proactive, proposing creative shots and poses in a way that didn't feel overbearing or intense while reassuring us that our day would be captured to the fullest. We were so thrilled with the photos that we received not only in terms of composition and lighting, but more importantly, in the soul and emotion that Alena was so deftly able to draw out. Alena also worked hard to get us preview photos while we waited for the full set of photos, which were delivered on time as promised. We cannot recommend Alena more highly and we are so glad we chose her to photograph our wedding and engagement shoot! We will definitely think of her again should another special occasion arise in the future.

My husband and I could not have been happier with the photos and service we received from Alena. She and her husband, Alex, are the nicest people. We planned our wedding in Oakland...

, CA, from SoCal so we relied heavily on phone interviews and email contact to choose our vendors. I found Alena through the Wedding Photojournalist Association, and was drawn to her photos. Working with Alena was so easy! She was extremely responsive by email and phone, and made herself available every time we visited the Bay Area. She showed up early to all our appointments, gave wonderful suggestions for the best times to take our engagement and wedding photos. She took time to research and visit potential locations for photos, and found some great spots for us in San Francisco and Oakland! It is clear Alena loves what she does because she was patient, and spent A LOT of time with us during our engagement shoot (more than agreed upon in the contract) and on our wedding day. She and Alex were professional, flexible with last-minute changes, and friendly with our other vendors and guests alike. Alena's photos were beautiful, natural, and captured so many memorable moments of our day. Her online gallery is easy to use. She also turned around photos sooner than I expected. We highly recommend Alena.

ne key moment of the wedding missed. During our Golden Hour shots, my husband and I were surprised to hear a drone overhead which ended up capturing very whimsical shots of us from the air as well as the rolling hills surrounding the ranch property which were absolutely stunning works of art! She also set up flashes elevated on poles at the four corners of where our outside dinner was so that speeches and dinner moments were captured with perfect lighting and we barely noticed when the flashes went off. Alena got so many intimate shots of me getting ready with my mom and the makeup artist but I barely noticed her because she was polite and discrete. I feel like that's the trademark of a great wedding photographer, they strike that perfect balance of being invisible but also front and center when they need to be to get the shot. What truly blew me away was that Alena sent me preview photos THREE DAYS after the wedding which was incredible to be able to share photos with friends and family so soon after the wedding and it really helped to keep the magic alive and keep re-living the day. I cannot recommend Alena highly enough, it is so important to have a good photographer to document your special day and you will be in amazing hands with Alena.

She captured the perfect blend of candid photos throughout the entire day and also did an impeccable job staging our bridal party and family for group photos. I know we'll cherish all of the pictures for decades to come and I am so excited to showcase them throughout our newlywed home.

Alena and her husband, Alex, are just the sweetest and we loved working with them during our engagement session and wedding. The main characteristics I was looking for in our photo...

grapher were: 1) specialized in candid shots 2) fit within our budget and 3) a nice person that's easy to work with. Alena immediately fit the bill. We also chose to go with their photobooth services, which they offered at a discount, and all of our guests loved. Our engagement pictures were beautiful. My husband and I felt a little awkward getting photographed but Alena put us at ease and managed to get some really great candid shots. Alex got some really beautiful drone shots as well. On the day of our wedding, Alena and Alex showed up early at the hotel and went straight to work. We were so impressed on how efficient they were! They had walkie talkies that they used to very covertly communicate with each other. We were even ahead of schedule! My husband's family is very large, and Alena was very patient navigating through all the family shots. I told Alena that besides the posed family/wedding part shots, we mostly wanted candid pictures. She did not disappoint! Exactly a week after the wedding, she sent a preview of just over 80 pictures and they were beautiful. About 2 months after the wedding, she sent the remainder and again were just wonderful. I highly recommend Alena for any photography service. She is so sweet and was such a pleasure to work with.

We shared a list of can’t live without photos that we wanted from the day of, and they made sure we got every one and plenty more! 2) She has an exceptional talent with natural light photography, and made sure my new hubby and I had a romantic sneak away at sunset to get the best of it - it is also great to bring both the venue and our guests to life! 3) I also really love their eye for candid photos, especially since my husband and I didn’t want to be staged all the time during the wedding and love the artful composition of her shots 4) they have a great photo booth option that you can add on which is super convenient, and you get copies of all the booth prints in hard and digital copy 5) they are super easy to contact and very responsive to needs and preferences you have for your big day, including flexible with their time and location. We couldn’t be happier with the photos and the value of their services, many thanks to both Alena and Alex for letting us relive our wedding through incredible photos! I am already surprised how much I go back and look through my photos, it really was a perfect day and it is great to have it so well captured on film.

Their experience was heaven-sent as they were able to guide us toward better sites, and inform us which spots would be best as the light changed throughout the day. Wedding day went off without a hitch, and our families loved them. They were able to interact with our families and snap candids without disrupting the feel of the day, and were sweet throughout. The photos came back beautifully, on-time, and they threw in some awesome drone shots, too. We wouldn't hesitate to recommend or hire Alena again!

We found Aleena through a friend who had gotten married shortly before we did. I don't know a ton about photography, but my husband does and he was excited by her portfolio. We wer...

e so happy that her quote was within our budget, and she is honestly much more talented and easier to work with than other photographers I have heard of who charge much more! My husband handled all of the contact and prep work with Aleena, which included meeting up at the sites beforehand and discussing his artistic vision. She was so prompt, responsive and easy to work with. Aleena is able to ask for what she needs [posing, etc.] in a way that in not obtrusive and gets beautiful results. I wasn't expecting to have drone pictures, but there were and they turned out spectacularly. Black and white photography can sometimes turn out cheesy, but Aleena's black and white photos [of which there weren't too many or too few] were absolutely gorgeous, timeless, and some of our favorites of the whole lot. We received our first set of sample photos less than a week after the wedding- while we were still on our honeymoon! It was 100 of the best shots [which is a HUGE number for a "sample" that arrived so quickly]. The remaining photos arrived exactly two months after our wedding, and they were in a sharable drive as well as in a GORGEOUS keepsake box with an engraving, beautiful thumb drive [i know that is weird to say about a thumb drive, but you'd have to see it] and glossy prints. Pros: Breathtaking, naturally-lit photos, good communication, quick photo delivery, friendly and easy to work with, incredible cost to quality ratio Cons: absolutely nothing! We LOVED working with Aleena. We couldn't have asked for more.

Our wedding was located on a beautiful venue in West Marin with ample opportunity for creative photo moments. Alena took this chance and ran with it, generously dedicating time bef...

ore the wedding to visit the venue so she could see the light beforehand and get an idea of where she would need to be during the day. Once our day came, she arrived with her crew and got busy with what I am sure was an exhausting session. She captured over four inside locations, as well as an outdoor ceremony and rehearsal spread over a very large property. And she did so without the slightest hitch. What impressed me was the efficient manner in which she came into the groom's quarters, took charge of the inhabitants, got the job done, and carried on. But the real point of this review is that we just had time to finally sit down and look at our pictures and they are absolutely amazing. We could not be more happy with her work. And this says nothing of her sweet disposition. I sincerely recommend Alena for your big day--or any other event, for that matter. She is great and we thank her.

My husband and I had an outdoor wedding and we absolutely loved the different shots that Alena got. She did a great job at following our preferences and getting the shots we reques...

ted. And she also had a lot of great ideas of her own. She was able to move around quickly but we hardly even noticed she was there. She is great at capturing moments and candid photos. Alena was so great to work with and so sweet. We are so thankful we chose her to be our wedding photographer.

Highly skilled and amazing photographer :D Alena was awesome! We hired her for an afternoon at city hall and then for an evening reception on another day over the weekend. We met u...

p to talk over details and she was very accommodating and flexible with what we wanted (more candid and casual as opposed to posed shots; mixture of indoor and outdoor; shoots on two different days). She was extremely professional, friendly and, most of all, very good at what she does. Here are some things we loved about working with her: +very responsive to emails +the contract was clearly written +very skilled with a range of lighting conditions (bright sunlight, shadowy indoors) +turnaround time for previews and final shots were quick +high quality uploads +gave good direction for posed shots +pricing was highly competitive for the bay area +great suggestions for backdrops +visited/researched our venues in preparation Her portfolio is incredibly impressive and we could tell she really loves what she does. Honestly, we feel so lucky to have had her as our photographer because the photos turned out amazing! We felt like she really captured the atmosphere of our wedding. It was a great pleasure working with Alena :) Highly recommended!

Nothing I can write here will do Alena and her photography justice. My husband and I are not super romantic people, we don't love our pictures being taken and were very fearful of ...

the wedding photography process. Alena made everything easy- nothing felt forced or fake. As a bride I wanted photographs that I wanted to stare at forever but were a true representation of my husband and myself. After 12 years together we finally tied the knot and my photos will be cherished forever! If you are on the fence don't be- Alena is a true pro, her photographs rival those that are double and triple her price point. Thank you Alena for making our day perfect, we are so happy.

Alena and her husband, Alex, photographed my wedding in July 2017 in Tiburon, CA. I can't say enough positive things to capture our experience working with Alena, but I'll try to d...

raw on the highlights. First, Alena is a steal. With her experience, you'd be hard pressed to find someone that's also at her price. She has years of experience under her belt, and is pricing low because she's trying to break into the Bay Area market. Her work is exceptional, despite having the lowest quote we found. Second, Alena and Alex are extremely warm, sweet, supportive, and positive. The charm and kindness they brought to the first meeting drew us to hiring them, and they had proven to be nothing less than a supportive and warm presence throughout the wedding process. Planning a wedding is a tough process for many, but these two put you at ease and remind you of the romance. Third, Alena is super responsive and flexible. Any communication and/or concern is resolved quickly and professionally. She makes it a point to be extremely flexible for you. Meeting in person just to chat, viewing the venue, having her arrive at a certain time on the day of the wedding...despite her living out in Sacramento, and we live in Berkeley (and having our wedding in Tiburon), she makes sure to make every appointment on time and molds to your schedule as much as possible. Just this alone helped make the wedding planning process much smoother. Fourth, Alena and Alex are extremely professional on the day of the wedding and beyond. Honestly, I completely forgot they were there most of the time. Alena was present for the morning prep (makeup and hair), and she fit completely seamlessly into the day by snapping many gorgeous photos while blending into the background. Her non-intrusive style helped me and my bridesmaids relax and just completely be ourselves - nerves and humor and all - while she caught wonderfully candid moments. Throughout the day, her and Alex's photojournalistic style were able to capture so many moments we missed, while making everyone look good! But also importantly, she was also able to direct posed shots and suggest placement and timing for our first look, sunset shots, and bridal party/family photos. Even a request for a re-edit of photos, Alena took with positivity and responded with a newly edited version rapidly. We hope to one day work with Alena and Alex again!

Alena was amazing! Both her and her husband took amazing shots. They got beautiful shots and really captured the day. I do not feel really comfortable posing in pictures but she wa...

s very helpful in posing both me and my husband and our posed photos are some of my favorite that we received from her! I like that she captured all the elements from the day because it goes by so fast. I am able to look at her photos and have memories brought back. Alena and her husband are awesome in setting up where they need to be, I almost didn't notice them! I love the artistic creativity that Alena has as well. The pictures came out so soft and wonderful which really captured our wedding.

Alena was absolutely fantastic on our wedding day, and the preview photos she sent us are reflective of that. You can tell she is passionate about photography and creating beautifu...

l visuals, and we couldn't be happier with the images so far, and can't wait to see all the photos. Prior to our wedding, we met with her in person over a glass of wine so she could get to know us as a couple, and I shared with her some images on Pinterest that matched the vibe we wanted to see in the final product. She also took the time to visit the venue to get a sense of what she'd be working with about a month before our big day. During the ceremony, there are two photographers present to capture the different POVs. The images we're most pleased with are the unposed, genuine moments she was able to capture, especially during the ceremony...the laughs, the exchanged glasses, etc. It was a beautiful day for us, and I'm thrilled that we have Alena's photos that will allow us to visually relive the day in years to come.
