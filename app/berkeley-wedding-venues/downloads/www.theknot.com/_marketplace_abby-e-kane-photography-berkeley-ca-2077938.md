Abby E Kane

Owner

Hi - I'm Abby! Owner, artist, and storyteller here at Abby E Kane Photography, based in San Francisco, CA. I'm from New Mexico and moved to the Bay Area in 2020 when I started graduate school. I began second shooting for experienced Bay Area wedding photographers and quickly realized that wedding photography was the right career for me. I opened my own business in July of 2023 and have been a full-time wedding & elopement photographer ever since. I love to capture moments with both a documentary & an editorial eye. Storytelling, details, and those "in-between" moments are important to me as I capture your special memories and turn them into beautiful artwork. I can't wait to meet you & document your story!

We lucked out in finding Abby! From the very beginning and our very first Zoom call with her, we instantly knew we wanted her to be our Wedding photographer. We asked Abby a ton of...

questions and she had an answer for everything, including Plans A, B, C, and D in case things didn’t go as planned. She was extremely communicative, transparent, personable, organized, and her incredible work spoke for itself! We loved Abby’s natural approach and warmth in her editing style. Abby was monumental in helping plan our entire 8 hour timeline, starting with our first look, moving over to SF City Hall, and then finishing at our 100 person reception venue. Her knowledge of City Hall and Weddings played a HUGE part in helping navigate the planning stages of our wedding, resulting in a smooth and stress free day, with 0 hiccups! We would give her ideas and because of her experience she would provide amazing feedback and suggestions, which we gladly took, resulting in the most perfectly timed day imaginable! Prior to our Wedding, as a couple, we had never done a photo shoot before. The package we went with included an engagement shoot photo session. She made both of us feel at ease and become comfortable in front of the camera, which in turn helped us for our big day! Between the Engagement Session and Wedding Day, Abby was able to have us pose perfectly, without them coming off as cheesy, but also able to capture countless candid photos of us. Both for the Engagement Session and Wedding Day, Abby was able to deliver beautiful and stunning sneak peaks, which both us and our guests were amazed by because of how fast we received them. If you’re looking for a photographer for your wedding or life/family event, we would HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend Abby to photograph it!

It just so happened that our first time working with a professional photographer was on our wedding day(!) and we are ever so lucky to have found Abby to work with. Abby was super...

sweet and such a delight. We felt very comfortable with her – and she let us be ourselves while still guiding us, so that we didn’t feel too ‘posed’ or stiff, which was absolutely reflected in the photos that she captured. Abby was also super communicative, professional, and quick to deliver our previews and finalized photos. Additionally, we encountered a bit of a snafu with our venue, but Abby was able to think of a workaround, and she was extremely gracious in doing so. We highly recommend Abby as your photographer!

We had a fantastic time working with Abby for our engagement photos and our wedding! \- She is incredibly organized. We were never worried about anything Abby was in charge of, bec...

ause we knew she had it covered \- She did a great job of making us feel comfortable in front of the camera, to the point where we were even having fun (the same goes for her second shooter, Ditto) \- She was great at wrangling family members, while also being very considerate and asking before she would make any adjustments of clothes/poses/people \- We LOVE our photos. We've already gotten a bunch of compliments on the engagement photos that people have already seen, and we can't wait to share more of our wedding photos. She did a great job of capturing the joy, the emotion, the ridiculous dance moves. We're so grateful to have such wonderful pictures from such a special day, and we're so glad we chose to work with Abby! We'd recommend her in a heartbeat.

ng to her and even more so in front of the camera. Our engagement shoot was an absolute blast and made us look forward to the wedding! We had a fall wedding and were specifically looking for someone who could execute a photography and editing style that was warmer to compliment the warmth of our color schemes and nature that time of year. Wow did we make the right choice. The comfort in front of the camera, the meticulous planning and timeline assistance and the consideration of our colors and venues really came together in the final product. We remain in awe every time we look at these photos of the joy and beauty that was captured by Abby on our day. 1000 times would recommend, and we can’t wait to work with her again in the future.

Abby is absolutely phenomenal! While I absolutely LOVE our elopement photos, what stands out to me about Abby is not just her fabulous work product (which speaks for itself).. but ...

how Abby went out of her way to make my partner and I feel incredibly comfortable given how camera shy we are. Few examples of why we absolutely loved having Abby capture our big day 1\. Abby knew sf city hall incredibly well and was quick and efficient with helping us get the popular spots. At the same time she was so respectful of all the other couples and photographers there which speaks to her great work ethic! This was balanced by her very calm, easy going persona - she genuinely cares and it comes through with how excited she is to be there. It was like having another friend with us on our big day - a very talented friend at that. ;) 2\. We hit traffic on the day of our elopement and were deeply apologetic for being late. We also had a much longer than anticipated wait time at the clerk's office. At no point did Abby pressure us about the time for photographs. I think it's so important to be respectful of time and was very worried about the delay - Abby's approach was the perfect balance of professionalism and empathy, which I deeply appreciated. I felt like she put us at the center of our big day through out, and in the end that is a level of care that can be hard to come by when photographers are as good as she is :)

Abby and her team are amazing!! We could not have had such a perfect wedding without her! We hired Abby as our wedding photographer and she exceeded expectations on every level. F...

rom the beginning she was extremely communicative and prompt in replying to messages and questions. She is extremely fair in her pricing and worked with us and our coordinator to make sure everything was in place before the wedding day. For example, a few weeks before the wedding Abby shared a form that covered all the photos we wanted to take at the wedding (when, where, who) and even made us think about aspects of the wedding we didn't realize needed to be planned! So thoughtful. On the wedding day Abby was the star behind the scenes. We arrived late to the venue and Abby managed to get us back on schedule (and actually with time to spare) before the ceremony without sacrificing anything. We even took more photos than planned! And she worked with every other vendor to make sure that there were seamless transitions and that all aspects of the wedding were captured. The most amazing part is that Abby had not been to our venue before. She is such a good photographer that she took perfect photos the first time she was there. Oh, and an added plus is that Abby has a very clean and intuitive website. It makes working with her and seeing all the photos a breeze. Abby provided sneak peek photos the day after our wedding and had the whole package of photos processed so quickly after (only 6 weeks!). The photos are truly amazing and capture the spirit of the day and made everyone look so beautiful. Everyone we show the photos to comments on how amazing a photographer we had. In short, Abby is incredible and you should consider her for all photography needs!

Abby is more than a photographer; she's a memory weaver. The family photos she captured are not just images but slices of our life, radiating warmth and authenticity. Her ability t...

o connect on a personal level made the session relaxed and enjoyable. Each photo tells a story, and we're grateful for the timeless moments she preserved. If you're seeking a photographer who goes beyond the lens to capture the heart of your family, she's the one. Highly recommended.

We were looking for a last minute session for holiday and maternity photos and were so happy with Abby’s work. The process to book was super easy and she replied quickly with guide...

s and tips. On the day of the session, she was communicative and clear about where we were meeting. She was easy going and made us feel comfortable during the session. Moreover the photos are gorgeous and even better than we expected. Overall the whole process was super easy and wonderful. We’re looking forward to working with Abby again soon!

I hired Abby to do a branding session for me to help me market my new business. The session went so well that I felt compelled to come on here and write her a review. Abby made me ...

feel very comfortable in front of the camera, which is hard to do, and as a result I got images of myself that I am proud of and excited to showcase! She was very responsive, arrived to the photoshoot early and prepped me with materials ahead of time so I knew what kind of clothing to wear and what I could expect to experience with her and at the location I chose. I highly recommend Abby for any of your photography needs and will absolutely be hiring her in the future for any of my photography needs!
