I had a good experience buying a bridesmaid dress from them for a wedding about 10 years ago, and kept them in mind for my own wedding. I was sad to discover that Nordstrom shutter...

I had my first bridal appointment in November of 2018 with Maria. That was when I said, 'Yes to the Dress!' My dress came in a few months later and so began the alterations. I ha...

d 3 or 4 appointments to tailor the dress to my frame. The appointments were fast and Maria was always on time. Dee, who was my alterations person, was lovely to work with and a pro. At my last fitting, she was sewing the dress while I was in it. My dress came out beautifully and I honestly wish I could wear it again. The only downside to my experience: I did not receive any appointment reminders. This caused me to miss one appointment, but Maria was able to get that rescheduled without an issue.

The Nordstrom Wedding Suite had so many different dresses to choose from. So many different styles and the staff were great. Everyone at the Wedding Suite was friendly and helpful,...

but my stylist Alisa was simply the best. I came in not knowing what I wanted and she gave me great dresses to start with. As I tried on dresses and gave my opinions and critiques, Alisa listened and tailored the next dresses to my liking. She was amazing and knew the products well. She answered all of my questions and made my dress and me feel special.

The wedding suite at SF Nordstrom was amazing! Corin and Natalya were the most helpful people. I found my absolute dream dress, but then they made it better. I loved everything abo...

ut my dress, aside from the back, which was totally open. Natalya completely reconstructed the back of my gown, putting in beautiful buttons. There is no way at all to tell it is not how the gown was originally designed. The alterations had so many thoughtful touches, from tiny loops for bra straps, to gold pins for the bustle that could be easily found but wouldn't show through the sheer fabric of my train. Corin was totally understanding and helpful through every step of the process, even when I second-guessed my gown.

Found the perfect dress through Miranda! A style I had not in mind but tried on by her suggestion and fell in love at first sight. She moved away before my last fitting and every...

one was super nice and accommodating. I had a few alterations that were addressed promptly and immediately! So I felt I was in good hands the whole way through. I felt and looked amazing on my big day and I can’t wait to try on the dress again on my anniversary! Haha

Alisa in SF's Westfeild Center was terrific. She was on top of everything on each appointment and made sure my voice was being heard during alterations. I knew I wanted a Hayley Pa...

ige dress and so I made an appointment for the HP trunk show. When I called to book, the attendant asked which dresses I had interest in, as they would make sure the store had them for my appointment. Truly terrific! All alterations are done in house and timely. When the dress was ready, Alisa even brought it to our car for an easy pick up. Very helpful! Don't forget those triple point days too! With you Nordstrom Card you can pick the dress payment day for your points.

NORDSTROM is one of my favorite stores and I was thrilled to find out my local store (San Francisco) had a wedding suite. I found my dream dress there - a mermaid shape dress with...

light beading and little ivory arm dressings to make it look a little different. The designer is Pronovias and I chose the ivory satin material. What I loved most though was the service. Alisa was amazing and so patient in helping me find the perfect dress in the time I needed. Plus because their alterations has a team they don’t need as much lead time. I was able to receive my dress (early June) and have it ready in three weeks, the day before my wedding. My seamstress, Natalia, was also amazing. She fixed the bodice so that it became a new sweetheart neckline - and she created a beautiful bustle. I loved working with Alisa and Natalia. I can’t recommend them enough. Also because I’m a loyal shopper of NORDSTROM I was able to use my alterations credit toward my dress alterations- saved me a lot of money!!

Nordstrom has been amazing from start to finish! I first came to them because I was looking for a specific dress by Watters. While they didn’t carry the style I was after, my ama...

zing consultant Miranda managed to track it down when the store hosted a Watters trunk show. I had called at least 5 other high end salons that would NOT do this so I was thrilled. Way above and beyond normal customer service. And lo and behold it turned out to be my perfect dress!! (If you don’t have a specific dress in mind they also have a wide selection at a variety of price points - much of which you can see online, along with ballpark pricing.) Miranda has been amazing through the whole process, guiding me through all the way through fittings & alterations like a total pro. She even helped find a dress for my mom which was ... ahem ... no small task. Alma in alterations is also basically a magician. I feel so lucky to have had such a seamless bridal experience via Nordstrom :) zero stress and a fabulous dress!!

Working with the Bridal Suite at Nordstrom SF was an incredibly disappointing experience from the first email interaction when trying to order a bridesmaid gown. I found both the S...

ales Associates and the department Manager both incredibly rude, demanding and condescending-- a complete letdown as someone who is used to stellar customer service at Nordstrom. When I expressed my disappointment in the way I had been treated, the Sales Associate forwarded my email to the BRIDE in a spiteful revengeful act that only stressed the bride out and created tensions. When I reached out to the Manager about this complete lack of privacy, she offered no apology but rather acted flippant and as if I had done something wrong. The best part was that I was in the store a few weeks later with a friend, and without introducing myself, both women were terribly rude and off-putting. I guess they treat everyone that way. Do NOT waste your time here during what is supposed to be a great experience. This is an amateur team. Our entire bridal party ended up ordering from Downtown Seattle's bridal salon who was nothing but incredible to work with every step of the way.

If there's one thing I've always been able to trust Nordstrom for it is EXPERT alterations. I've been getting everything altered there for 5+ years and the folks they have on their...

alterations team are all super experienced - no young people just starting out over there - and deal with clothing much more expensive than my wedding dress was on a daily basis. I know there are a lot of options in SF for wedding dress alterations, but I just couldn't trust a strange place I haven't used with something as important as my wedding dress. And I seriously paid ~$75 for the alterations! Plus, because I'm a Nordstrom card holder, I got it back in the form of a Nordstrom note! If only every aspect of the wedding prep could be this easy. Bless that whole operations team and their families! *Note: The wedding suite alterations folks are the same alterations folks for every department. I actually walked into the Via C department to ask for an alterations specialist's help.

The ladies at Nordstrom Wedding Suite in SF made my wedding dress buying experience an incredible one. From the day I went to try on dresses, to saying yes to my (gorgeous) dress, ...

to the day I picked it up, everything was easy and fun. I even missed an appointment once (I'm an out of town bride) and they were so accommodating and helpful. My dress was gorgeous and the entire experience with Nordstrom was so memorable. HIGHLY recommend!
