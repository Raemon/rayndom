### What is a reasonable budget for a wedding?

Wedding costs are different for everyone and vary based on your weddingâs location, size, season, and more. The average cost of a wedding in the U.S. ranges from about $17,000â$55,000 depending on the city or state. Keep in mind, the key word here is âaverageâ and your wedding may be above or below this based on your personal wedding details. The Knotâs wedding Budget Advisor can help you understand average wedding costs and get a wedding budget estimate based on what real couples in your area typically spend.

### How do I save money on my wedding?
