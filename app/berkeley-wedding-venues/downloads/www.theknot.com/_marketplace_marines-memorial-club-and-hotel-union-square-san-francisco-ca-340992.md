After searching venues, I ran across the Marines' Memorial Club & Hotel. It's a beautiful, historic building close to Union Square. After chatting with the wedding specialist on th...

e phone, we arranged for a meeting and showing of the venue. We both loved the ballrooms with their blush pink walls trimmed in gold, high ceilings and crystal chandeliers. We loved that MMC offered wedding packages that included lots of extras. By signing with them, we would not only have our ceremony and reception site, but also have booked our catering, bar service, day of coordinator, etc. etc. This helped save us money and gave us piece of mind. The wedding specialist, Lisa Jimenez, invited us to attend the wedding expo to be held later that month so that we could talk to vendors, sample the food and experience the service, and see the ballrooms staged for a wedding day. We enjoyed ourselves at the expo and left knowing that this was it. We had found our venue and had a wedding date. At our final planning meeting we had a final walkthrough of the venue, reviewed timelines, menu, made notes and dropped off all the items at the venue. Neither of us had seen the ballrooms in months so it was reassuring and a nice reminder of why we picked the venue in the first place. Our Day of Coordinator, Jessica Lynch, was amazing! She worked with both of us for the last few months of the wedding, fielding questions, filling in any gaps and being a positive reassuring presence on the day of the wedding. We plan to come back again to celebrate an anniversary!

I found the Marines' Memorial Club and Hotel on the Wedding Spot. My fiance is active duty Navy, and we planned our wedding in a two month time period. We could not have asked for ...

a more accommodating and supportive staff and venue to make our dream day come true. Lisa at the MMC was able to get us into the Crystal Ballroom on a Saturday night for our reception. Lisa made herself available to my via phone and email since I was planning the wedding from Hawaii, but also was able to meet with my parents who are in the Bay Area. The reception itself went smoothly with their capable day of staff (Simone was working with us). The MMC offers great pricing and understood that there could be last minute changes with my fiance's schedule. I had a great experience working with Lisa, Simone and the MMC and had an amazing wedding!

We could not have been more excited to have our wedding at the MMC in San Francisco for our October 2016 nuptials. Lisa Jimenez was so attentive to all of our questions and any con...

cerns that we had along our almost 1.5 year process. She made sure we had all we needed for our special day. The bridal suite was amazingly wonderful. Plenty of room for my bridesmaids to get ready. We had 2 hairdressers and 2 makeup artist, 2 photographers and a videographer in the room and we had plenty of room. We had our ceremony and reception on the 11th floor in the Crystal Ballroom. Our ceremony was beautiful. We transformed the ballroom with curtains and floral arrangements to block the back and front walls. The help we received with all of our plans was amazing. We selected an open bar with passed hors d'oeuvres. From the buffet set up we asked for the antipasto and cheese trays to be placed in the cocktail bar for our guests to enjoy before dinner. Our guests tell us the food was great, we didn't get to try much of it as we were chatting with guests and taking pictures. We took our main set of pictures in the beautiful library post ceremony, totally recommend at least a few pictures there. Simone, our day of coordinator was great. She made sure everything ran smoothly throughout the day, even fluffing my dress one last time before I walked down the isle. We set up a charging station for our guests and the MMC set up a sign with their Wi-Fi. What a nice touch...our youngest guests were excited to have Wi-Fi available throughout the night. Our wedding ended early the next morning and were welcomed to our suite with a bottle of sparkling wine, cake and a set of beautiful MMC flutes (which we accidently left in the room). We had the wedding of our dreams and can't thank the MMC staff enough for all they did! Lisa you are the best!

Spectacular wedding reception at MMC! We booked the MMC's classic and elegant 10th floor Commandant's Ballroom for our daughter's September 2016 wedding reception, working with t...

he wonderful, thoughtful, gracious, and always-cheerful Lisa Jimenez. She is a treasure. Although the MMC is a military venue, we are not affiliated with the military and did not feel that the military ambiance was predominant (or even noticeable) during the reception. The MMC provides a variety of inclusive options for a wedding reception in various price ranges, and also provides facilities for a ceremony (though our daughter's ceremony was held at another SF location). Package fees include a Day-Of Coordinator, cocktail hour, dinner, entrance hall with grand piano and coat closet, attractive linens, lovely china, crystal and silverware, silver candelabras, comfortable chairs with linen covers and sashes (chiavari extra fee), tables, dance floor, risers, LED up-lights (reasonable fee), A/V system, place cards, attentive, professional and well coordinated food service staff, excellent bartenders, labor, tip, and a large, comfortable hotel suite for the couple (which includes king bed, three roomy closets, full length mirror, spa tube, mirrored dressing area with separate sink/counter area, city views, Wi-Fi, refrigerator, bar/sink area, coffee maker, wide screen TVs, couch and chairs, 2 counter height chairs, fresh fruit, after ceremony bottle of champagne, buffet breakfast). Block of rooms set aside for guests at reduced room rate. Lisa was always supportive, responsive to our questions, very communicative, and helpful. Day-Of Coordinator, MaryAnn Hatlan was fantastic: discrete, flexible and simultaneously attentive and low-key throughout the reception. MMC's Lisa and MaryAnn accommodated our talented family friend, Mike Rao, who played guitar during the cocktail hour, by providing a safe storage place for his equipment and a well-chosen place for him to set up. We ordered the "Nob Hill" 5-hour reception package with Platinum Bar Service and enjoyed an hour-long cocktail reception in the Regimental and Heritage Rooms before dinner, with an open bar and our choice of 5 delicious hors d'oeuvres served by attentive wait staff. Sit-down dinner included salad, two entrees (filet mignon and grilled salmon were excellent), wedding cake (serves 100 guests), coffee/tea, wine (white and red) and champagne, followed by 2 additional hours of open bar. DJ, Allison Peck of Hearts of Gold was fantastic; attractive wedding cake by Jill Branch of Branching Out Cakes was delicious; all floral arrangements by Carol Antracolli of An Added Touch were magnificent. Photographer Hannah Arista of Hannah Arista Photography (of L.A.) operated throughout the ceremony and reception in a discrete and personable fashion. Make-up and hair by the incomparable Toni Marion and Chris MacDonald of The Dream Team of Marin. Our guests really enjoyed themselves and we received so many compliments about everything. MMC was sensitive to the special culinary needs of guests, including providing gluten and dairy free meals, as well as vegan/vegetarian selections. (MMC provides vendors' meals, and also a children's meal at reduced per person costs.) MMC's champagne and wines were very good and its bar tenders excellent (hired 2). We expected the event would be well handled and beautiful but in every instance MMC's staff exceeded all of our expectations and has given us the most wonderful memories.

hemselves available to us all the time via email and also offered to set up as many phone calls when we needed. They were also flexible with us visiting when we traveled to San Fran to tour the venue and meet with our coordinators. Marryann and her team were so great to work with and talked to every detail as often and as in depth as I wanted to. The ballrooms are gorgeous and they were very flexible with our personal touches. They are the experts, and gently told us why they thought an idea wouldn't work as we thought and even offered modified suggestions. The restaurant was good to us as well and the staff helped us sit together for a brunch during our stay there. Our room was so pretty and they even left us a gift which was above and beyond. I would recommend a stay here at the very least, but go ahead and also plan your wedding there too!

d my husband is a US Marine). Everyone said the wedding was gorgeous--the staff made the event seamless. The long term planner, Jennifer Chin was OUTSTANDING. The only reason I gave them 4 stars and not 5 is because I had multiple issues with my DOC and I am an easygoing person, so this was a big surprise. Day of, she made others comfortable (I assume, as they loved the wedding), but she literally made me cry. Also, if either or both of you are active duty military, they give an excellent discount for non-Saturday weddings.

ok at the details. The main ballroom does not have a bathroom on that floor and people would have to go around this corner then downstairs. BUT around this corner is this memorial wall of passed on soldiers (which would have to be covered during the event) and that just felt depressing. Then the carpet was comming up from the floor in ripples, the room had an odd smell, the lights looked dusty and uncleaned, and the honeymoon suite had military stuff all around the entry way. It's nice if you remember it's a MEMORIAL place. It just felt like it brought the cheerful event down... oh and the lady who we met with kept trying to correct our english when we would talk. Annoying.

"Love is lovelier the second time around," and so is the Marines' Memorial Club and Hotel! I selected the MMC&H for the venue of my first wedding reception out of convenience. It...

turned out to be a fabulous reception. Forty years later, I found myself in the position as a widow engaged to a widower, preparing for another wedding. Having already had the best weddings, it was hard to choose the sites for this one. My fiancé and I finally agreed to select the best from each of our first marriages. For him, it was the church. For me, it was the MMC&H. I did not make a mistake. The service and attention that Cheryl, Tippi, MaryAnn and other staff gave were incredible. The attention to details and the responsibility they took in helping me plan made the entire process effortless. The evening of the event went as nicely as the planning. My guests are still raving about the beautiful and elegant reception provided. Many of my local, as well as my out of town guests, took advantage of the convenience of the hotel accommodations with complimentary happy hour and breakfast. Future brides, give yourself a wedding gift by having your reception at the Marines' Memorial Club and Hotel.

The rest of the staff was amazing but we had problems with the manager that drove us crazy right up until the day before our wedding. It was pretty disapointing and certainly unexpected.
