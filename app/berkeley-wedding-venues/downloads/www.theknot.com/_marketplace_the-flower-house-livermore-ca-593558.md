Jinger and Michaela are ROCKSTARS. They made my wedding floral dreams come true. Our flowers were stunning, our guests were blown away, and my jaw dropped when I saw my bridal bouq...

uet. They were accommodating and collaborated with me to create my vision. Part of that vision was having florals placed up an oak tree for our ceremony. Unbeknownst to us, the tree was crawling with fire ants and Michaela was bitten over and over while installing our florals on the tree. I can't thank you both enough for your hard work and dedication that day. You both are truly amazing and I was so in love with our flowers. XO

nsive to our questions and needs. The quality of their work was truly excellent - we were thrilled with how our bouquets, centerpieces, arch, and other florals turned out. They went above and beyond to ensure our vision came to life, and were very upfront about costs to work within our budget. The meetings we had were super helpful in finalizing all the details. I loved our florals so much that I am even getting them dried and pressed so I can have them forever! We would absolutely recommend The Flower House to any couple planning their wedding. We're so happy with how our florals contributed to making our special day perfect.

I cannot say enough amazing things about The Flower House specifically Michaela! From the very beginning, I shared my vision of wanting the most colorful, vibrant flowers possible—...

and they delivered beyond my wildest dreams. Every bouquet, arrangement, and floral accent was bursting with life, color, and creativity. It was exactly what I hoped for, and so much more. The flowers were, without a doubt, one of the most beautiful and memorable parts of our entire wedding. Guests are still talking about how stunning everything looked—from the ceremony arch to the reception tables. The way they blended bold colors and unique textures showed true artistry and attention to detail. Michaela listened closely to what I wanted and brought it to life with such care and passion. She even met me and helped me pick our table cloth colors etc…It was clear how much love went into every arrangement. I felt completely supported throughout the process, and they made everything feel so easy and stress-free. If you’re looking for a florist who will honor your vision and create something magical, CHOOSE THE FLOWER HOUSE!! Their work made our day feel like a fairytale, and I’ll be forever grateful. -Miranda D

I had a genuinely incredible experience working with The Flower House for my wedding. Due to extenuating circumstances, our previous floral arrangements fell through about 6 weeks ...

before the big day. We reached out to The Flower House, and they serendipitously happened to have that specific date still available amongst all of their bookings. They got us rolling immediately and were so efficient, understanding, and professional. I had collected vintage vases that I was hoping to still be able to use, and they accepted without any pushback. Their communication was excellent, and after our first call, I knew that they truly understood my vision. That being said, nothing could have prepared me for how beautifully they executed it. Our flowers turned out more stunning than anything I had envisioned. I had multiple guests come up to me and tell me they were the prettiest flowers they had ever seen. I am deeply biased, but to me, no other flowers will ever compare. I can not thank The Flower House enough.

The flower arch, ceremony flowers, and reception flowers were so beautiful and our sweetheart table was breathtaking. The florals from The Flower house perfectly embodied the romantic vibe and atmosphere that we wanted for our wedding. So many of our friends and family commented on how beautiful everything was and that 100% would not have been possible without The Flower House. The Flower House really helped bring our vision to life and made our wedding day look like it came straight out of a fairytale!

They totally nailed our "floral vision", had all of the bouquets and boutonnieres labeled with names, and even moved ceremony florals to the sweetheart table seamlessly.

We LOVED the beautiful arrangements that The Flower House team made for our wedding. We received so many compliments and asked us how we were able to find such lovely arrangements...

and who our florists was. The team certainly exceeded our expectations. I am so glad that we had the opportunity to work with Flower House. Ginger was professional and extremely helpful in creating the right color scheme and design without breaking the bank. I truly appreciate all of her honesty and constructive feedback when I was discussing my initial plans with her. She was also a great advocate on the day of the wedding, when she noticed some design discrepancies at our ceremony space and made sure that my venue staff fixed those errors. She looked out for us to make sure that we were happy with floral arrangements and that we were enjoying our day without stressing over the details. Out of everyone that I worked with, The Flower House staff were among our favorite vendors.

Jinger and Michaela were absolutely amazing to work with and over exceeded my expectations for our wedding. They were extremely responsive and helpful throughout the whole process ...

and made me feel confident that everything would run smoothly on the big day. We had several zoom calls with Jinger where she answered all of my questions (even ones not related to florals/decor). Unlike a lot of brides, I did not initially have a super clear vision of what I wanted for florals so Jinger took the time to walk me through lots of different options. I'm so glad she did because I ended up doing things that I had never even heard of (e.g. I did a flower ring for my flower girl which was absolutely darling and perfect for a toddler that wouldn't know how to throw flower petals). On our actual wedding day, Jinger and the Flower House team took care of everything without needing anything from me like true professionals. When I walked down the aisle, it was the first time I saw the floral arch and that alone nearly brought me to tears (aside from seeing my husband to be lol). Seriously I cannot tell you how many people came up to me to tell me how much they loved the flowers - not to mention how many pictures I saw people post pictures under the arch. I would highly recommend the Flower House to any future brides or anyone in need of florals for a big event.

The Flower House did a fantastic job with the florals for our wedding in July 2022. The florals/design aspect of our wedding was the part I was dreading the most because I am much ...

more of a logistics gal. Early on I decided to really only decorate with florals, and I'm so glad I went that route. Our flowers were absolutely stunning and I couldn't be more happy with the way our whole venue was transformed with them. Florals are expensive yes, but I felt like we didn't waste any money on them and got a lot for the price. They were all so beautiful and added so much depth to our venue! When I had first talked with Jinger I showed her a photo of our ceremony location and she suggested a floral floor arch rather than a more traditional standing arch. I'm so happy I went with her recommendation, it couldn't be more stunning (and apparently is a 2023 trend we jumped on early!!). Flower house did all our bouquets, our cake flowers, installed flowers on the bridge for us, and did all our ceremony florals that got moved to our reception/dinner space. Thank you Flower House!!

I hired Jinger for my May 2020 wedding. Thanks to Covid my wedding was postponed three times. Jinger moved with me through all my date changes. Finally, on June 5, 2022, our fou...

rth wedding date, we had our big wedding ceremony and reception. I cannot stress enough how beautiful our flowers were! They were more abundant than I expected and color perfect. The detail and the quality of service were phenomenal! Being a bride is so much fun, I wish I could relive my day and I would definitely hire The Flower House again.

y that. Jinger was very responsive and helpful as I adjusted my order multiple times leading up to the day due to budget/design changes. She was so accommodating and the result was STUNNING! My vision was completely brought to life (and even better really with her expertise) and I will look back so fondly on my experience with The Flower House and my beautiful wedding flowers. I cannot say enough good things!

My husband and I found The Flower House through our venue, and I cannot express how happy I am with my choice to go with them! The Flower House is a mother-daughter florist company...

that has been in the floral game for years. You can tell how experienced they are by their professionalism, responsiveness, and attention to details. At first, I was nervous about booking the right florist that'll capture my vision for my wedding. From the very first meeting with The Flower House, I immediately felt at ease knowing that they understood my vision, style, and answered any questions I had about different floral arrangements. I never felt intimidated or that I was asking silly questions as they made me feel like they truly cared about me having the wedding of my dreams. They were always timely and responsive and tried to keep within my budget by offering suggestions to changing certain things in my proposal. They were also very accepting and worked with me through my budget. Honestly, I am an anxious person and did get very nervous not knowing for sure how my florals and decorations would look until my actual wedding day. But, I decided to trust in the process and when I saw my florals turn out on my wedding day, it was literally what I've dreamt of and MORE! The Flower House not only delivered, but they "understood the assignment" & gave me the wedding of my dreams. You can tell they really care about their clients & that their clients truly love their work. I'll definitely order from them for future events!! Thank you Jinger & Michaela <3

We couldn't have asked for any better florists than Jinger and her team! We initially decided to inquire about their services for our wedding due to a friend's recommendation, but ...

after the introductory call, it was obvious this is who we wanted to work with. From the beginning and all throughout the process, Jinger was flexible (we postponed from 2020 to 2021 due to the pandemic), quick to respond, and thoughtful about what we wanted for our florals. She gave us plenty of suggestions on what would look nice at our venue, Nella Terra Cellars, and ideas on how we can repurpose and make the most out of our flowers. We gave Jinger and few inspiration pictures and our color palette but other than that, trusted her on what would look best - and she and her team absolutely delivered! We couldn't have asked for a better vendor to work with. We highly recommend The Flower House to anyone looking for florals for their wedding!

g! Every guest commented on how gorgeous the flowers were (bouquets, boutinnieres, ceremony walkway, the custom made altar, etc). The work they put in went far beyond what I imagined for our wedding florals. Jinger was extremely supportive throughout the planning process as well (we had postponed due to covid) - helping figure out linen colors, decor ideas, and new floral themes when we changed seasons with the postponement. Would 1000% recommend The Flower House to anyone seeking a fantastic vendor for their wedding day florals! :)

ding date and Jinger was incredibly understanding and accommodating. She is so knowledgeable and was able to create a beautiful, cohesive look in spite of all of my indecisiveness. She went above and beyond and even gave us some really wonderful design advice that definitely helped bring the room to life. We ended up getting married during a rain storm and Jinger and her team were quick to repurpose all of our intended outdoor flower arrangements. I'm so grateful we went with The Flower House and would highly recommend them!

n May 2021. I created so many mood boards and not all of them cohesive as I loved a couple of different concepts, but Jinger was able to find the common threads between them and the result was beyond beautiful. Everything was so lush, fresh, and stayed beautiful all day thanks to strategic bloom selection Jinger coached us on to avoid certain flowers that don’t hold up throughout the day. Trust her - she won’t steer you wrong. Everyone raved about how stunning the arrangements were!

ooking for when I didn't even have words to express it. Jinger was so flexible through two postponements and incredibly timely and responsive to every email and concern that came up during our planning. When we finally had our third wedding date locked into place and wanted to switch up the floral vision, Jinger knew exactly how to implement what I wanted. She took the reigns and even helped with several other design aspects...she is just a natural! She also helped with our rehearsal dinner design and florals and knew exactly how to execute what my MIL and I were picturing. Two weeks prior to the wedding day, we decided to move the wedding outdoors and Jinger instantly had the best vision for re-arranging and utilizing all of our florals to create a stunning sweetheart table backdrop. We were speechless when we saw all of the flowers on our day...it exceeded every expectation we had. During pre ceremony portraits, we saw their team working so hard to make every detail perfect. They spent so much time and energy on our day despite a very busy 2021 summer/fall wedding season. Their team is so talented, creative, detail oriented, and fun! They felt like friends throughout the whole process and genuinely made our dreams and visions their priority. My only regret is not planning ahead to preserve some of our bouquets...they were so beautiful and I wish they could last forever.

All I can say about The Flower House is WOW! Jinger and her team truly made my vision come to life on my wedding day. We had an initial phone call with Jinger to chat about themes,...

visions, and what I was expecting for the big day. We walked through my Pinterest board and she really took the time to understand what I was hoping for. Fast forward to the wedding day - the flowers showed up and they were absolutely stunning. I was completed blown away with how beautiful the bouquets and centerpieces turned out, and I feel like the vision for my wedding came together because of the flowers. I can’t thank Jinger and her team enough for all the support, and for actually listening to my requests and thoughts along the way. Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!

Unfortunately I wish I could be writing a beautiful review as so many others have. My initial phone meeting with Jinger was wonderful (never once had an in-person meeting). She lis...

tened to my vision and gave some great input. A few days before the wedding my photographer requested I get the styling blooms from them. I reached out to Jinger through email to see if I could pick them up from their studio. The responses I received made me feel like I was putting them out of their way. The day of the wedding, when my photographer pulled my bouquet from the box, I was in shock. The flowers looked nothing like we discussed. For a second I thought I received someone else's flowers. The flowers at the altar didn't even match my color scheme. I wrote Jinger an email to find out what happened. Her response to me was that she told me in a meeting the shortage of flowers (she never did) and basically 'it is what it is'. She never personally explained to me that the flowers would change drastically. If so, I wouldn't have been so shocked on my wedding day. If I'm paying over $5k for flowers, I would expect better communication. Some sort of communication a week or so before the wedding explaining to me that the flowers would not look like what I ordered would have been nice. I understand that these times are tough on everyone, however, I am really disappointed in how drastically different my flowers turned out.

y. During that meeting you could tell she was very knowledgeable and she really took the time to get to know what I did and didn’t like by walking me through a bunch of photos. She even helped us pick out our linens and decked our reception space out with candles. Jinger was a joy to work with and so responsive for any questions I had along the way. I would absolutely hire The Flower House again in a heartbeat.

practical, Jinger made the floral planning process so easy! I knew nothing about wedding planning, let alone florals, but she listened, was receptive to my ideas, and was super helpful! I showed her pictures of the designs and colors I liked. She took my vision and ran with it - a true professional with an eye for design. If I had any questions, I would get a quick response within 24 hours. Come the day of our wedding, the flowers were PERFECT. It was exactly what I had envisioned! A huge thanks to Jinger and her team at The Flower House for all of their help and bringing my floral vision to life!
