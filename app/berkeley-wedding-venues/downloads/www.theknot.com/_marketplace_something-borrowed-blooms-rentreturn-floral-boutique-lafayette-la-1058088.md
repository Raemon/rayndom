I'm so glad we used SBB for our bridal party! My ceremony venue was a greenhouse that didn't allow fresh flowers other than a bridal bouquet and a groom's boutonniere, so we needed...

a silk florals option. We chose the Audrey style for my bridesmaids bouquets; we also got boutonnieres for the groomsmen, and some corsages for our moms. The sample was beautiful, and the flowers for the day of were exactly as expected! Super well packaged too, and they came several days ahead of schedule - this was great for my pre-wedding jitters! These flowers are beautiful and look just like the real thing. Love the price point and sustainability. I cannot recommend enough!

Renting our flowers from Something Borrowed Blooms was truly one of the best decisions we made during the entire wedding planning process! I’ve never been someone who prioritizes “...

real” flowers, and I knew I didn’t want to spend $15k+ on arrangements that would be tossed out that same night. I briefly considered DIY options, but it felt overwhelming and we simply didn’t have the space to pull it off. After seeing countless Instagram ads, I finally checked out the Something Borrowed Blooms website and I was immediately impressed. I compared several companies and combed through reviews, but nothing came close to what SBB offered. I ordered a preview pack, and even though it didn’t include my exact bouquet style, I loved the quality enough to move forward with booking all of our floral décor. The flowers arrived early (about 5–7 days before our wedding) beautifully organized and carefully packaged. Our day-of coordinator handled the setup, and when we walked into the venue, we were blown away. Everything looked stunning! No one could tell the flowers were rented, and honestly, even if they had, it wouldn’t have mattered because they looked amazing and felt so intentional. Plus, it felt great knowing we weren’t wasting money or throwing away fresh florals at the end of the night. Returning the items afterward was incredibly easy with the prepaid labels. The entire experience was seamless from start to finish. If you’re on the fence, choose Something Borrowed Blooms!! You won’t regret it!

t a week or so before my order shipped and my order shipped well over a week before I had to leave for my beach wedding! I went with the Kinsley collection for everything. Of course, my favorite part was my bouquet! I also ordered the yellow hairpiece the corsages for both moms which were stunning! My Husband had the pocket flowers as his boutonniere which I loved having the yellow, make him stand out and match me! Our wedding party was our man of honor and best man so they had the pink boutonniere that also matched the father of the groom and our wedding officiant. The only downside was tracking everything down the day after the wedding from everyone because I wasn’t totally on point with remembering that but thankfully everyone ran over to us and gave us our stuff back so I can return thankfully, my only one box to something borrowed blooms. I just dropped it off at a local FedEx down at the beach. I did steam my flowers the night before I do feel like it helped a bit! Everything was so pretty, and my flowers were already wrapped in ribbon. The mom‘s corsages were comfortable on their arms and all of the boutonnieres had safety pins! I will definitely be using something borrowed blooms in the future. I plan on using them when we have a baby shower!

We were so pleased with our rentals from SBB! One of the brides was really allergic to flowers, and we wanted a wildflower look. The flowers arrived on the Tuesday before our Satur...

day wedding and looked pretty good! Some of the arrangements had a little more wear than others, there was a black sediment-type thing on some of the petals but it wasn't noticeable in the reception lighting or in pictures. We didn't have time to steam the flowers, so they were put out as-is. For faux florals, they looked a lot better than the other companies or DIYs we saw. They were a little pricey, we spent around $1500 for 2 bridal bouquets, 14 small centerpieces, and 5 altar arrangements. We were quoted around $2500-3000 for similar real flowers, so it did save us some money! I will say, it was a bit of a hassle because you will need dedicated people to take the flowers to the venue, put them out, box them up, and mail them back. We enlisted the help of family but if you're having a luxe wedding this may not be the best route. Overall, we really liked SBB and are happy with our florals!

mething Borrowed Blooms via Instagram and decided to reach out. They assured me that there was still plenty of time, and even gave me a date by which I should order the flowers if I wanted them on time. Their selection was gorgeous (I ended up using the Nina collection), and the shipment arrived a couple days before the wedding! They were absolutely stunning, and I am so happy with the results! I also love that we could rent them as my biggest concern about getting flowers was that they would go to waste afterward. Whether you're looking for a last minute flower fix or want the best looking selection at your wedding, I would highly recommend Something Borrowed Blooms!

I used a SSB for my bridals and thought I wanted to use some centerpieces for the wedding but had to cut down costs a month before our wedding so I cancelled the centerpieces. Read...

the fine print, as I could not get a refund for products I never even got. Customer service was quick when I asked about this but also very vague when explaining refund processes via email. The bouquets I got were pretty and good quality but I don’t necessarily think that the florals from this shop are less expensive than other florists. Not to mention the rental period is very short and you have to worry about sending back your florals the day after your event which is exhausting.

We understand that wedding planning can be overwhelming, especially when budget changes come up close to the big day.

Our flowers were beautiful. Delivered in plenty of time for us to travel out of state with them and the shipping window was reasonable. We got married on a Saturday so we were able...

to ship them out on Monday without issue. My only issue was that one of our blooms received for the bridal party had popped off the bouquet. We were able to pop it on without issue but it was a bummer. Also as a note to other borrowers, tell your bridal party ahead of time that they will need to be collected back at the end of the night. We had to hunt a few down after some people had left so it was a bit tricky but something that would’ve been easily addressed with proactive communication on our part. It is a great financially conscious choice that we got many compliments on them. People had no idea they were artificial flowers and no one cared. Also all of the boutonnières held up through all the hugs and pictures so that is a huge plus.

💕Audrey + Eloise floral review 💕 Recently, I used SBB for my wedding over this past weekend. Let me just say that I was very satisfied with the whole entire process. The shippin...

g did make me nervous a bit but I was reassured it would all come in time for the wedding. I ordered 7 tall gold stands, 7 grand Audrey centerpieces, 7 Eloise grand centerpieces, 6 Eloise boutonnière (dahlia), 5 Eloise boutonnière (rose), 5 Eloise bridesmaid flowers, 2 Eloise wrist corsages, 2 Eloise floral swags, and 1 Eloise white bridal bouquet. I had a total of 15 boxes delivered to the house. I will suggest for future brides that you should rent a van, truck, or someone who has a big vehicle to transfer the boxes. It was extremely helpful for the company to give you pre-printed FedEx labels so you can just stick out on the box whenever you are ready to return it back. I received so many compliments on the florals! Some people even thought they were real. They photograph very well! Overall, I am happy with the whole entire process. Would I recommend this company to another bride? YEA! Would I ever use them if I need them again in the near future? YEA!

I’m seriously blown away at how easy and stress free it was using Something Borrowed. First of all, their scented flowers smelled delicious and lasted the whole week until my weddi...

ng. Second, their flowers are gorgeous and so realistic. I got so many complements all night, and everyone was surprised when I told them they were silk and rented. Lastly, just the cost alone, of renting vs buying is so worth it. I could never justify spending thousands on something that would die in 3 days. I was pretty much set on not having any florals at my wedding. I was so grateful when my mom suggested rented flowers instead for literally 1/8 of what real would have cost. The most “stressful” part was just making sure I remembered to collect them all at the end of the night, but I made a list of who had boutonnières, corsages, etc., and made sure they were all collected immediately after ceremony/pictures. I would use this company again in heartbeat. And highly recommend to anyone who asks.

They even offered to overnight new flowers to us immediately for the ceremony if we couldn't get access to the other ones.

omething will come to you. But I can proudly say from the moment I received them (even a couple days before the anticipated arrival date), I was so wrong! I chose to do half faux and half real for my wedding. My rule was anything guests could touch or that I couldn't accomplish with SBB to be real and everything else faux. I did all our wedding party faux and some additional uses with the Jane collection. The florals exceeded my expectations!! You literally cannot tell a difference and it saved us so much money going this route. The whole process so smooth and easy, too. You could change your order up until shipping date (what bride doesn't change her mind over time??), which was super convenient. I would recommend SBB to anyone and my best friend is using them for some of her wedding florals, too! I am definitely keeping them in mind if I ever need florals for any event I host or help with. Thank you, SBB, for making our day so memorable and so special!

I would highly recommend Something Borrowed Blooms to any bride looking to add a touch of elegance to their wedding without the hassle of managing fresh flowers and the cost of fresh flowers. Great service, top-notch products, and stress-free experience overall!
