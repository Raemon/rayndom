Kismet was absolutely incredible. We hired Kelly for our September Sonoma wedding and we truly could not have pulled it off without her. We had interviewed a handful of planner...

s, and I felt like I hadn’t found the one until I came across Kismet and had my consultation with Kelly. We immediately clicked and I knew I could trust her with my vision. Not only did Kelly execute the planning incredibly, she also took the reins on coordinating with the rest of our vendors to make sure the day-of went exactly as planned. Kelly was so incredibly thorough and detailed and even put together a contingency plan with us for unlikely but important “what if” scenarios. She kept us on track, answered all of our emails promptly, and knew exactly when we needed to focus on what so we weren’t burning out throughout the process. Above everything else, Kelly is a wonderful, kind human being. She radiates kindness and warmth and I’m so glad to have gone through this journey with her. On the day of, Kelly was there for me every second. From holding my train to cueing up our wedding party to seeing all the vendors off, she handled everything beautifully. She also went as far as to find us an on-site dog sitter for our pup! I could not recommend Kismet enough, especially Kelly. We love you, Kismet!

y're about people. They took the time to really get to know us, understand our vision, and guide us through every step with a calm, confident presence that instantly put us at ease. What stood out most was the perfect balance they strike between being incredibly personable and highly professional. Kelly, Rosie and Jackie are the kind of people you feel instantly comfortable with—warm, approachable, and genuinely invested—but behind that easygoing vibe is a team that knows exactly what they’re doing. Their experience shows in all the best ways: nothing was ever missed, forgotten, or left to chance. They thought of details we hadn’t even considered and handled every curveball with total grace. On the day of the event, everything ran seamlessly. We didn’t have to worry about a thing because the Kismet team had it all handled—quietly, efficiently, and with a smile. Their presence allowed us to be fully present, which is honestly the greatest gift they could’ve given us. If you’re looking for planners who are both seasoned pros and absolute joys to work with, look no further than Kismet Event Co. They bring heart, experience, and a whole lot of magic to the table. Thank you, Kismet Team!!

She is calm, professional and most importantly I would call her a friend! She made our day so special and effortless. You will love working with Kelly and the team at Kismet.

nd true investment in our unique vision. What could’ve been an overwhelming planning process felt easy, collaborative, and genuinely fun with her by our side. Kelly has that rare combination of being deeply organized and logistically brilliant and also warm, intuitive, and totally unflappable. She helped us navigate every detail—from custom sound systems to hand-fasting ceremonies to shark disco balls—with zero judgment and total enthusiasm. Her encouragement helped us create a wedding that felt wholly, weirdly, joyfully us. We never felt pressured to do things a certain way. Instead, Kelly made space for our ideas, helped shape them into reality, and made sure every detail ran smoothly. On the day itself, her steady presence made all the difference. We were able to be relaxed and fully present because we knew she had everything under control. She advocated for us with the venue, handled vendor coordination like a pro, and even helped carry my (inevitable) armful of too-many-things between rooms. She made sure that all of our guests were taken care of and the entire experience unfolded like a dream. Even my quirky request for Lord of the Rings entrance music was perfectly timed thanks to Kelly’s blocking and attention to detail. It felt like an actual cinematic moment. We’ve had so many friends and vendors tell us it was one of the best weddings they’d ever been to—and Kelly is a huge part of why. She made our dream wedding become a reality and for that we’ll be singing her praises forever. If you want a wedding that feels personal, joyful, and totally seamless—hire Kelly and the Kismet team.

nable solutions. We were always impressed by how she remembered small details and created thoughtful responses or solutions to them even at times when we forgot. Moreover, despite her empathy, she was able to always keep us moving along and on track. This is also largely due to her impeccable organization skills and foresight to give us an ample heads up to anticipate tasks and timelines. Overall, she holds herself with tremendous poise, professionalism and open-mindedness. She's an extremely hard worker who is not afraid to get her hands dirty to get things done. She takes full responsibility of her projects and maintains a high standard. She also has a ton of experience, which aided her to bring in refreshing ideas and skills into our work together. I would recommend her to anyone and wish to work with her again in the future!

etely at ease. Her attention to detail, kindness and patience, and genuine passion for what she does transformed our ideas into a magical day that exceeded our expectations. Every step of the planning process was seamless. She was always organized, responsive, and one step ahead, making sure every detail was covered. Whether it was sourcing the perfect vendors, keeping us on schedule, or handling last-minute hiccups with grace, Kelly took care of everything so we could focus on enjoying our special day. On the big day, everything ran like clockwork. The decor was stunning, the timeline was flawless, and every guest raved about how beautiful and smooth everything was. We felt like VIPs the entire day, knowing we were in such capable hands. Every bride and groom's worst nightmare happened on our wedding day - our outdoor venue was rained out in the morning (in May, in California!) We were so upset and surprised. But Kelly worked hard with the venue to make sure everything was still as magical and perfect. And honestly, it turned out even better than we could have imagined. We even got a rainbow in our photos. Kelly came to our rescue. I honestly don't know what we would have done without her. If you're looking for someone who truly cares about making your wedding unforgettable, look no further. Kelly and her Kismet team is worth every penny and more. Thank you for giving us the day of our dreams—we’ll be forever grateful! Highly, highly recommend!

er been part of,” or, “That was one of the best weddings I’ve ever been to,” or, simply “Your planner is amazing.” One of the best decisions we made was hiring Rosie, because every other decision sort of cascaded off of that. She helped us choose our vendors, and made sure all the contracts were iron-clad so there were no surprises during the day. She brings a wealth of experience to help guide in the process, from helping us choose our tablescape and décor to helping make our blue-sky dreams (DIY photo booth! Bubble grand exit! Popcorn-wall escort cards!) a logistical reality. She was organized, so professional and positive, and honestly just a beyond-delightful woman to get to spend time with. The day of the wedding, Rosie was a dream. As the bride and groom, we truly felt that the day went off without a hitch – which was corroborated by our guests (So. Many. Compliments). The flow of the day was perfectly smooth, and Rosie was helping with everything, from taking polaroids of our guests as they entered, to bustling my train, to making sure our table visits stayed on the timeline, to answering guest questions, to hunting down safety pins…. I don’t know how she was in so many places at once. If you’re thinking of hiring Rosie, do it. She is an absolute pro and a dream to work with, and I truly cannot recommend her highly enough. Thank you Rosie we love you!!!!

The initial information she sent was concise, clear, and let me know right away the different service levels and the associated costs. We hopped on a quick introduction call and I was sold! From our first call, Kelly made me feel like I was going to be in the best hands for all of my wedding planning needs - I didn't take any other calls and hired Kismet right away. This was simply one of the best decisions of my whole wedding because my husband and I were beyond impressed with the Kismet team during months of planning, but more importantly on our wedding day. We had zero worries on the day thank you to the Kismet team who was working so hard to make everything perfect. If they had any issues behind the scenes, we had no idea!! :) We got so much amazing feedback from our guests of our beautiful and perfect the day was, and a very large part of that was all of the hard work from Kelly and team. It's worth noting that I am VERY type A and cared very much about all of the small details. I had 1000% trust in the Kismet team to make my vision come to life and they did that and more. Thank you so much, Kelly and the Kismet team.

I cannot recommend Rosie enough! She was absolutely essential in making all of our wedding dreams come true. Rosie was extremely organized and detailed oriented, always keeping me ...

on task with our timeline, offering up new trendy ideas, insightful advice and detailed floor plans. Her knowledge of local vendors and our venue (Ru's Farm) were truly invaluable. Anytime I voiced a vision, she went above and beyond to make it happen. She made us feel so calm the day of, knowing that everything was in good hands and letting us really enjoy our day. Her positivity is contagious and an absolute joy to work with. My whole family was amazed with her efforts!

We hired Rosie for our daughter’s Sonoma County wedding. Rosie is a fabulous wedding planner and a wonderful partner for such a personal event. She was always positive and jumped ...

in to help, even in areas that weren’t necessarily her responsibility. Rosie was a perfect mix of providing great ideas and suggestions on areas where we were less knowledgeable, while also deferring to us on anything we felt particularly strongly about. Our wedding had inherent complicated logistics that involved 3 days of events, shuttle buses and establishing a wedding venue out in the field on our property. We hosted a similar event on the east coast when we lived there for our older daughter and the comparison of how easy and helpful Rosie was were startling. Rosie was always positive and worked with whatever request we had. Also, Rosie not only has a great list of wedding vendors, but she also has great working relationships with these vendors which helped us so much as customers. Our recommendation is step 1: Hire Rosie!

Hiring Kelly at Kismet as a “month-of” planner was the best decision we made for our wedding. We had her come in pretty last minute because we wanted to do all of the planning but ...

needed someone to bring all the details together and make our wedding feel special and thoughtful for all our guests. Wow, I just didn’t know I needed her so badly. Right away, she got in touch with all our vendors and looked through all our contracts to make sure we weren’t missing anything. Sure enough, she caught some things we’d missed altogether in our rental order. And we loved the playbook timeline that brought all the details together in one place and made it feel like a real production. Her knowing other people in the wedding world made it even more helpful. Kelly was professional, friendly, easy to work with, and FUN!

ng ahead. She reviewed every contract and coordinated with every vendor to make sure everyone was on board and ready far before our event. She thought of every detail and made sure all plans were in place so that we could give her the reins and just enjoy our event! And WOW did she pull it off in spectacular fashion! I had heard from all my friends that there would be some minor or major disasters at any big event, but she actually did so well that I can't complain about even one part of our wedding! It was the wedding of our dreams, and I credit Rosie with making it all happen seamlessly on the day of. She was so supportive, thorough, organized, and truly the most responsive person I've ever worked with. I felt totally confident in her every step of the way. In short, we are so lucky to have had Rosie on our side, and I would recommend her in a heartbeat!

The Kismet team were such pros, and I love how thoughtful and personal they were during our planning process with the “Kismet Sidekick” package. I have a pretty busy work schedule ...

and was able to calendar our monthly check-ins based on my hours, which was huge for me. I didn’t have tons of time to plan, so they emailed me with lists and vendor options which made my life so much easier! I was able to do as much or as little as I wanted, which was especially important because I care a lot about some things, like food and music, and not a lot about others, like rentals and flowers. They just filled in the gaps with amazing vendors, and I was stunned at how beautiful everything looked. On my wedding day, my husband and I just showed up, and they led us through the entire day. I can’t imagine doing all of that by myself, and we just keep thinking back on what we’d have done without them because we were able to enjoy every minute. Thank you, Kismet!!

My now husband and I interviewed about 10 different wedding planners. Rosie was the last one that we spoke to because after speaking with her, we new that she was the right wedding...

planner for us. She made the whole process so easy! She was professional, responded quickly to my many emails/texts and gave me a ton of recommendations. We got married on a private vineyard that had never had a big event before. Rosie took care of creating the layout for the day and figuring out the flow of the wedding. Throughout the whole process, anytime I was feeling stressed about something related to planning our wedding she would always reassure me and/or find a solution to whatever was causing the issue. She took care of so many of the little details that I wouldn't have even thought of and she did a wonderful job coordinating all of our vendors. You cannot go wrong by hiring Rosie to be your wedding planner. I will encourage all of my friends to use her because she made our wedding day more perfect that I ever could have imagined. The whole day was stress-free thanks to her.

The short version: Rosie is the most phenomenal planner and person to work with, and you absolutely need to hire her for your wedding! The long version: When we were first plann...

ing our wedding, my (then) fiancée and parents didn’t think a wedding planner was necessary because our venue came with a venue coordinator. Luckily, I convinced them that a wedding planner was a must. Fast forward to after the wedding: my (now) husband and parents said that Rosie was the best decision we made while planning our wedding! I don’t know where to even begin with Rosie! I guess I’ll start by saying she is proactive and organized when it comes to wedding planning, and I have very high standards when it comes to organization (#virgo.) She orchestrated the most magical evening by skillfully managing our vendors and creating a flawless timeline. Because of Rosie, our wedding night went without a hitch. Throughout the entire planning process and our wedding night, we could feel that she truly cares for her couples. When we had a vendor cancel at the last minute, Rosie swiftly came to the rescue. During the wedding day, she constantly made sure that we were enjoying ourselves. I’ll give a couple of examples: 1\. Rosie had two glasses of champagne in hand right after the ceremony ended, which she gave to us and led us to a quiet space to enjoy ourselves right after getting married. 2\. While we were taking photos after the ceremony, Rosie put together a tray of hors d'oeuvres for my husband and I, and made sure we ate in a private area right after photos were done. This was so clutch because we ended up never making it to our own cocktail hour because of socializing and photos. Rosie gave us the opportunity to try our own hors d'oeuvres! 3\. When my husband was getting overwhelmed from taking so many photos (lol), Rosie noticed and informed our photographer that we wanted to take a break. There are just a couple of seemingly little things that Rosie did for us that made such a huge impact on us because it really demonstrated that she was looking out for our best interests. Everything she did was with such grace and care, all while getting s*%& done. We cannot praise and recommend Rosie enough!! I honestly want to throw another event just so I have the opportunity to work with Rosie again. I’ll end this review with one anecdote: we have a groomsman who has been in a couple of wedding parties and he told us right before the wedding, “Wedding planners scare me.” The same groomsman came up to us after the wedding and said, “Wow, your wedding planner was amazing.”

Our wedding was the best weekend, and it would not have been possible without Rosie's expert guidance and attention to detail. Thank you so much! Rosie advised on many aspects we ...

would have never thought of -- seating arrangement, procession order, and the day's flow. The table arrangements, vendor coordination, and ceremony were all seamless. We especially appreciate the small touches of support -- the parking signs, parasols (which thankfully we didn't need), John's bowtie, my cozy blanket, the mead flutes right after the ceremony, your keeping us on track, and the extra prayer that kept the rain at bay. All of our guests felt so well taken care of, and they had a blast. We think the catering staff felt supported and appreciated as well. Rosie made us guests at our own wedding.

experience working with Rosie and our wedding would not have been such a success without her hard work and dedication! From the very first call, we knew Rosie would be the right planner for us - her kind, knowledgeable and calm nature was exactly what we knew would be important during the stressful wedding planning process. Due to Covid, we had to postpone our wedding date twice and having Rosie there to help us navigate this stressful time was such a blessing. Rosie and her assistant ensured our wedding day went even better than we could have imagined and everything flowed so smoothly due to her care and thoughtfulness. We truly had the best wedding day and we cannot thank her enough! We would 1000% recommend Rosie to anyone looking for a wedding planner!

Rosie was the wedding coordinator for our wedding in October 2021. Throughout the planning process, Rosie was professional and responsive. She reviewed all of our vendor contracts ...

before we signed them, helped coordinate our rentals, and gave great advice as a seasoned event professional. Rosie communicated the wedding timeline to our vendors and wedding party so everyone knew what to expect. The day-of the wedding, Rosie took care of the little mishaps (that are bound to occur) without us ever knowing. She clearly executed our timeline and managed our vendors while ensuring our wedding vision came to life. I was not worried about all the details and the timeline on my wedding day knowing that Rosie & her team were there!

entire process. From obtaining vendors, to the smallest detail, Rosie is there, keeping you on track the entire process so you never feel overwhelmed, making sure every detail is perfect, cares about your vision and making your day special. As anyone can imagine planning a wedding and then COVID hitting, is not ideal, but with Rosie leading the team, we knew we where in good hands, and we could not have gotten thru it all without her. I wish I had another daughter to marry off, to have the pleasure of working with Rosie again. Thank you Rosie for all you do !!!!

experienced, reliable, and an absolute pleasure to work with. She was clear about pricing and expectations, and made suggestions that made the day go on without a hitch. She spent countless nights on the phone with everyone from my mom to grandma helping us plan for a wedding weekend filled with activities for out of town guests and family.
