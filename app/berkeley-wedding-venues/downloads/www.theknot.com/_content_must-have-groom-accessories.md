Plus, we're bringing you some top tips and styling advice straight from an expert: Andrew Weitz, executive and celebrity style strategist and founder and CEO of [The Weitz Effect](https://www.theweitzeffect.com/).

## Essential Guide to Groom Accessories

While some men's wedding accessories might seem fairly obvious (shoes, socks and your [wedding band](https://www.theknot.com/content/best-mens-wedding-bands), for example), others aren't so black and white. What accessories does a groom _need_ , anyway? Should you wear a tie or a bow tie? Do you have to wear cuff links? Weitz's biggest piece of advice is to let the location and dress code dictate how you accessorize. For example, if you're having a destination wedding and the dress code is "coastal cocktail," you have plenty of room to play with your look. On the other hand, the rules are stricter with more formal occasions. "If we're talking about a traditional black-tie wedding, there are definitely some nonnegotiable accessories," Weitz says. "That means a bow tie, cuff links and either a boutonniere or pocket square." Ahead, we're bringing you a breakdown of the most traditional groom accessory options to help you decide how to top off your look.

FEATURED VIDEO FROM THE KNOT

**Traditional groom accessories:** Belt | Shoes | Socks | Cuff Links | Suspenders | Necktie or Bow Tie | Pocket Square | Boutonniere




### 1\. Belt

A great belt is one that not only keeps your pants secure but looks good doing it. While you don't _have_ to wear one, the go-to groom accessory is a perfect way to tie your wedding day look together. If you'll be wearing a suit, keep in mind that your belt will be visible when you take your jacket off. Wearing a tux? You'll want to reach for suspenders instead.

### 2\. Shoes

One of the most important groom essentials is a pair of shoes, and the options are pretty much endless. Perhaps your ideal pair of [groom shoes](https://www.theknot.com/content/super-stylish-grooms-shoes) is a classic leather loafer, oxford or brogue, or maybe you want to put a laidback spin on your look and wear your [suit with sneakers](https://www.theknot.com/content/suit-with-sneakers). You can also use this groom accessory as an opportunity for a standout touch. Bold embroidered smoking slippers? Alligator cowboy boots? Don't mind if we do.

### 3\. Socks

Unless you'll be barefoot in the sand or want that modern, ankle-bearing look, you'll likely need a pair of [groom socks](https://www.theknot.com/content/groomsmen-socks). A great rule of thumb is to match your socks to your [suit color](https://www.theknot.com/content/colorful-mens-suits-tuxedos) or the color of your pants, but don't be afraid to make a statement with a bold shade, fun pattern or custom monogram instead.

### 4\. Cuff Links

If you'll be sporting a French cuff dress shirt (the kind you wear with a tuxedo or other formal look), you're going to need [wedding cuff links](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-cufflinks). As functional as they may be, they provide a great opportunity to add some subtle personality to your outfit. "Having fun with your cuff links is a great way to change up your look," says Weitz. Instead of your standard gold or silver option, try something embellished or maybe even engraved with your partner's initials.

**Pro Tip:**[How to Wear Cuff Links](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-to-wear-cuff-links)

### 5\. Suspenders

Another fashion-meets-function accessory, [wedding suspenders](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-suspenders) are a must if you plan on wearing a tuxedo. Suits, on the other hand, are traditionally worn with belts, but you can opt for suspenders instead if you prefer that look. Black suspenders are the most common choice with a tux, but you've got plenty of room to experiment with colors and patterns if you'll be going the suit route.

### 6\. Necktie or Bow Tie

Wearing a [tie for a wedding](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-ties) isn't required for more relaxed dress codes, but it's one of the groom suit accessories you shouldn't overlook for a dressier occasion. Whether you decide to go with a traditional necktie or a bow tie will depend on your personal preference and what you're wearing, but note that tuxedos are most commonly worn with bow ties. Weitz says this is a great accessory to have a little fun with, no matter the dress code. "Even if you're wearing a bow tie, it doesn't have to be traditional," Weitz says. He also recommends avoiding clip-on bow ties, unless you don't know how to tie one yourself.

**Pro Tip:** [How to Tie a Tie](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-to-tie-a-tie) and [How to Tie a Bow Tie](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-to-tie-a-bow-tie)

### 7\. Pocket Square

[Pocket squares](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-pocket-squares) are decorative cuts of fabric that are folded and placed into your jacket chest pocket, and they can instantly take any groom's wedding day to the next level. When in doubt, you can't go wrong with a crisp white option—but you can also opt for a pattern or bold shade to add a pop of interest to your outfit.

**Pro Tip:**[How to Fold a Pocket Square](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-to-fold-a-pocket-square)

### 8\. Boutonniere

While far smaller than the bride's bouquet and table centerpieces, this classic floral accent can pack a major punch. Whether you choose a modern, single bloom pinned to your lapel or an artful cluster of florals in lieu of a pocket square, a boutonniere has the power to make your wedding day outfit feel intentional and cohesive with the event. Weitz recommends going with either a boutonniere _or_ a pocket square to prevent over-accessorizing your look. "If there's no boutonniere, I'd probably do the pocket square," Weitz says. "If you have a boutonniere, you don't necessarily need the pocket square."

**Pro Tip:**[How to Put On a Boutonniere](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-to-put-on-a-boutonniere)

## Stylish Groom Accessory Extras & Alternatives

Wedding accessories for grooms don't stop at bow ties and boutonnieres. If you're looking for a little _extra_ something, there's more where that came from. Today's [trending suit ideas](https://www.theknot.com/content/mens-suit-trends) are all about embracing unique accessories and extras, whether that means a glitzy brooch fit for a black-tie affair or a custom cowboy hat for your western-chic reception. That said, make sure you don't overdo it. "You want to be very minimal and clean and elegant on your wedding day, so I don't recommend lots of accessories, lots of color or too many things going on," says Weitz. Scroll on for a few statement-making groom accessory ideas.

**Extra groom accessories:** Watch | Jewelry | Sunglasses | Tie Bar, Clip or Pin | Hat | Bolo Tie | Cultural Groom Accessories




### 9\. Watch

A watch may not be considered _mandatory_ when it comes to groom accessories, but we'd argue that it might as well be. Unlike that bow tie or boutonniere, a beautiful [wedding watch](https://www.theknot.com/content/mens-wedding-watch) is a practical and versatile piece you can keep in your outfit rotation for years to come. There's no right or wrong choice here, either—a steel sport watch will work just as well as a sleek and simple option with a leather strap.

### 10\. Jewelry

Be it a family heirloom you save for special occasions, a statement signet ring or a minimal gold chain, don't underestimate the impact [men's jewelry](https://www.theknot.com/content/mens-jewelry-brands) can have on your wedding day look. If you want bigger and bolder, you can consider incorporating Weitz's favorite: a brooch or lapel pin. "This is something that's fun and flashy but still elegant," he says.

### 11\. Sunglasses

Few combos feel cooler than formalwear topped with a sharp pair of shades. If your wedding will be a daytime affair or at a tropical destination, this groom accessory will feel right at home. To keep your look feeling elevated, choose a pair on a sleek and understated side rather than frames that feel overly bold.

### 12\. Tie Bar, Clip or Pin

Though tie bars, clips and pins are often considered an extra touch, they do serve a practical purpose: keeping your tie in place. A tie bar slides over your shirt placket and tie, while [tie clips](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-tie-clip)—you guessed it— _clip_ onto your shirt placket and tie. A tie pin, on the other hand, is pierced through your shirt placket and tie. The latter is generally considered a bit more formal and decorative, often featuring ornate details and embellishments.

**Pro Tip:**[How to Wear a Tie Clip](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-to-wear-a-tie-clip)

### 13\. Hat

Maybe it's a fur top hat for your white-tie affair or a traditional cowboy hat you whip out at your ranch reception. No matter your personal preference, a hat is one of those groom accessories that can single-handedly take your outfit to the next level. The best part about this one is that it's easy to put on and take off, so you can use it as a way to change up your look throughout the course of the event.

### 14\. Bolo Tie

Between the spike in popularity in western-style weddings and seventies suiting, [bolo ties](https://www.theknot.com/content/bolo-tie-wedding) are as in as we've ever seen them. They're a great way to eschew tradition without sacrificing formality and bring a unique vibe to even the most standard of suits. If you're walking down the aisle at a farmhouse, barn, ranch or other outdoor venue, a bolo tie is a sharp wedding day accessory and will make for a memorable fit.

### 15\. Cultural Groom Accessories

The world of men's wedding accessories varies significantly across cultures. A traditional accessory option for Indian grooms, for example, is the safa: a turban symbolizing respect, honor and loyalty. In [Chinese wedding attire](https://www.theknot.com/content/chinese-wedding-attire-basics), grooms might wear a satin red hydrangea, while [Nigerian wedding attire](https://www.theknot.com/content/nigerian-wedding-attire) might call for a groom to wear coral beads.

While this means you'll find tie bars, clips and pins too, the retailer's actual _ties_ are the main event. Discover everything from modern to traditional options in a range of prints and colors, including pre-tied bow ties and neckties with extra length. Oh, and we can't forget to mention their collection of over 250 coordinating pocket squares. Use code **TIEBARxKNOT15** for 15% off your purchase.

[**Bonobos**](https://bonobos.soyxmd.net/c/64733/768773/11113?subId1=TK-must-have-groom-accessories&u=https%3A%2F%2Fbonobos.com%2F)**:** Bonobos is a one-stop-shop for any and all men's wardrobe needs, wedding day accessories included. You'll even find a designated [Wedding Shop](https://bonobos.soyxmd.net/c/64733/768773/11113?subId1=TK-must-have-groom-accessories&u=https%3A%2F%2Fbonobos.com%2Fwedding-shop) complete with professional fit and styling advice, where you can book an in-person appointment at a storefront near you. But before you do that, browse the retailer's selection of ties and pocket squares online, and don't miss the variety of chic and unique print options.

[**SuitShop**](https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&u=1030781&m=120753&afftrack=TK-must-have-groom-accessories&urllink=suitshop.com%2F)**:** When it comes to wedding suit accessories, SuitShop doesn't disappoint. The retailer's [tie selection](https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&u=1030781&m=120753&afftrack=TK-must-have-groom-accessories&urllink=suitshop.com%2Fcollections%2Fties%2F) in particular is an impressive one, boasting over 150 shades, prints and textures guaranteed to level up your wedding day ensemble—all at impressive prices, too.

### Groom Tuxedo Accessories

Socks, studs, suspenders—no matter the tuxedo essential, the following retailers have all your bases covered.

You'll find everything you need in order to put together a complete black-tie look, including odds and ends like collar stays and extenders, handkerchiefs and cummerbunds.

[**The Black Tux**](https://the-black-tux.sjv.io/c/64733/1498278/17671?subId1=TK-must-have-groom-accessories&u=https%3A%2F%2Ftheblacktux.com%2F)**:** One of the best things about The Black Tux is the fact that you can rent _or_ buy the retailer's formalwear styles, and the [tuxedo accessories](https://the-black-tux.sjv.io/c/64733/1498278/17671?subId1=TK-must-have-groom-accessories&u=https%3A%2F%2Ftheblacktux.com%2Fcollections%2Fall-accessories) ([tuxedo shoes](https://www.theknot.com/content/tuxedo-shoes) included) are no different. Don't want to commit to a pair of shiny black oxfords? You can rent them for just $35 instead of purchasing them at full price.

[**Suitsupply**](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=16225&awinaffid=565019&clickref=tk-must-have-groom-accessories&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fsuitsupply.com%2Fen-us%2Fmen%2Faccessories)**:** You may know Suitsupply for their custom-made tuxedos and suits, but the retailer excels in tuxedo accessories too. Expect to find refined versions of the classics—think mother-of-pearl cuff links, navy grosgrain suspenders and ivory silk bow ties.

### Groom Cuff Links and Tie Clips

[**Cufflinks.com**](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=9ibcrDa*U1o&mid=38889&u1=TK-must-have-groom-accessories&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fcufflinks.com%2F)**:** For the most extensive selection of cuff links out there, look no further than the one and only cufflinks.com. Want them to feature your college mascot? How about a photo of your partner? Cufflinks.com has it all.

**[Etsy](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6220&awinaffid=565019&campaign=&clickref=TK-must-have-groom-accessories&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2F&platform=pl)****:** If your goal is something one-of-a-kind or vintage, don't sleep on Etsy. Opt for a gleaming gold set of cuff links engraved with your wedding date or a vintage tie bar that will become a family treasure—the options are endless.

### Groom Watches and Jewelry

They may not be required, but they can certainly take your look to the next level. If you're looking to add to your current watch and jewelry collection or totally start from scratch, these retailers have you covered either way.

[**Citizen**](https://citizen-watch.pxf.io/c/64733/1391085/16603?subId1=TK-must-have-groom-accessories&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.citizenwatch.com%2Fus%2Fen%2F)**:** Whether you're totally new to watches or want to add another to your collection, Citizen has you covered.

### Groom Shoes and Belts

Your wedding shoes and belt might be some of the most functional accessories in your groom look, but they're also some of the most fun. Whether you want something classic and sleek or a statement-making piece, check out the variety of styles at these retailers.

[**Nordstrom**](https://nordstrom.sjv.io/c/64733/1960196/23920?subId1=TK-must-have-groom-accessories&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fbrowse%2Fmen%2Faccessories)**:** Can't decide whether to splurge on designer shoes or opt for an affordable pair?
