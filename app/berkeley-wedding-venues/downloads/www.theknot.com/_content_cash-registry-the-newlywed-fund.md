## The Best Cash Wedding Registry

Trying to find the best cash fund wedding registry? Then you've come to the right place. [The Knot Registry](https://www.theknot.com/content/tips-on-registering-for-wedding-gifts) is an all-in-one service, you can register for physical and monetary gifts on the same wish list. With only one link to navigate, it's easy for you to manage your selections and convenient for your guests when it's time to shop. 

There's also plenty of versatility in what you can request through The Knot Cash Funds. While you can use it for your postwedding vacay, it's not your only option. You can [ask for wedding money over gifts](https://www.theknot.com/content/asking-for-money-wedding-gifts) for anything you need, from home remodel contributions to date activities for you and your S.O. like a romantic dinner out or dance lessons. And, if you don't see exactly what you're looking for among the suggested fund options, you can create a fund with a custom purpose. (**_Psst._** Here's more [cash fund ideas for your wedding registry](https://www.theknot.com/content/cash-registry-ideas).) Overall, a cash fund can also help you not dip as much into your [wedding savings account](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-savings-account).

## How Does The Knot Cash Fund Work?

Cash funds look just like traditional registry items from [The Knot Registry Store](https://www.theknot.com/registry/store) (think: cookware, towels, serving utensils and home decor). They're listed with a picture and price, but when users click on the block, they'll be directed to a custom product description written by you about what the fund is for. **Side note:** Making a cash fund is similar to [setting up your honeymoon fund](https://www.theknot.com/content/3-things-you-need-to-know-about-a-honeymoon-registry), which is a cash fund that's for an overarching purpose with various wants and needs rather than a collection of unrelated cash funds.

There are no limits to how many cash funds you can add to your registry. For example, [adding a home fund](https://www.theknot.com/content/house-fund-wedding-registry) allows you to ask for money for appliance upgrades or a cleaning service or if you want to have a staycation, be tourists in your hometown and ask for money towards brunch for two or an outdoor excursion. And they'll all live alongside the classic registry items and [gift card requests](https://www.theknot.com/content/gift-cards-wedding-registry).

You can create cash funds of any amount—whether it be a fixed ask or an option for guests to contribute whatever they desire toward your goal. Additionally, you have the option to hide said goal number from guests, if that's what you prefer. Then, you can continuously check how you're pacing toward your goal and who gifted what. (Don't forget to add your registry, which includes your cash funds, to your [wedding website](https://www.theknot.com/gs/wedding-websites) so guests can easily find it.)

Finally, the checkout process for guests gifting cash is the same as if they were buying a physical item. As soon as a guest makes a donation to a cash fund, you'll get an email confirmation, so you can know who to send a thank-you note to, and the money will be automatically transferred to your bank account.

_Design: Falak Khoja_

  1. **Create a registry:**[TheKnot.com/registry](https://theknot.com/registry) is where you can make your registry. Navigate to the "Registry" tab and click on the "Start your free registry" button. A few prompts will pop up to help you customize your registry. Ensure you click the "Creating cash funds" during this time.
  2. **Make your cash funds:** Scroll to the "Add Cash Funds" section of the Registry Overview page and click "View All." You'll then be directed to the Cash Funds page where you'll find premade cash fund ideas like a romantic dinner or bike tour, but you'll also see a "Add a Custom Fund" button.
  3. **Create a custom cash fund:** Click the "Add a Custom Fund" button. A box will appear so you can input the cash fund's name, a note for your guests and how much you want guests to contribute. You can even add a photo to your personalized cash fund and view the cash fund as a guest to ensure it looks how you want. (Learn how to do the [wedding registry wording](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-registry-wording) to ensure you're being concise _and_ personal.)
  4. **Add your banking information:** Go to the Registry Overview page and click "Add Banking Info." Type in all your details and click "Submit" so your guests can start contributing to your cash only wedding registry as soon as possible.
  5. **Put your cash fund on your wedding website:** Click on the "Settings" tab. There you'll find your registry link so you can copy and paste it on your wedding website. We think only the best wedding registry for money has this option. (**_Psst._** Browse through these [wedding website examples](https://www.theknot.com/content/creative-wedding-websites) to see how you should design your site's look.)



## Does The Knot Take a Percentage of Cash Gifts?

The Knot doesn't take a percentage of cash registry gifts and it's entirely free to start a fund, link your bank account and share your wedding money registry. That said, there is a 2.5% credit card transaction fee that's charged to your guests and is typically less expensive than the taxes and shipping costs associated with a physical gift. Plus, a 2.5% transaction fee is actually the lowest you'll find anywhere—we've checked. We've found that guests are more than happy to foot The Knot Cash Fund fee, which means you get every penny of their monetary gift donated straight to your bank account. Now, if a fellow to-be-wed asks you, "Does The Knot take a percentage of cash gifts?" you know exactly what to say.

## How to Transfer Cash Funds From The Knot

Now—the most important question—how to transfer The Knot Cash Funds to your bank account? As soon as a guest makes a contribution to your cash registry, you'll receive an email notification. From there, it'll take up to five business days for the contribution to be deposited into your bank account. This time frame is a safety and security measure to ensure that The Knot Cash Fund deposit gets to you and only you. All of your information is handled with care and isn't used for any other reason besides transferring your monetary gifts. Additionally, if you'd rather not have the money sent directly to your bank account, you're also able to add Venmo to your account instead and have the money transferred there. 

## The Knot Cash Funds Reviews

Don't just take our word for why The Knot Cash Funds are the best cash fund wedding registry available. Check out these The Knot Cash Funds reviews from couples who've used our cash-only wedding registry themselves. 

### The Process Was Easy for Everyone

 _We got most of our gifts through The Knot Cash Fund option. I found it super convenient because I just set it up to deposit directly into a honeymoon/house savings account, which was seamless. Guests said how convenient it was for them because they didn't have to write a check or travel with cash._

### There Was Freedom of Choice

 _We heard from guests that they enjoyed being able to choose between our Honeymoon and Cash Funds on The Knot. Even if it all did go to the same place, it gave guests the autonomy they were wanting even with a cash gift._

### You Get the Best of Both Worlds

 _Guests can still do personalized or personal gifts. I think The Knot wording it as "experiences" helped people not feel they were giving cash––even though most were fine with it.__Having the cash fund was so helpful for starting on the right foot and being able to feel guilt-free about the expenses._

### It Was a Stress-Free Setup

 _My partner and I loved that we were able to easily sync our bank accounts and the gifts were automatically deposited, which was one less thing to have to worry about while wedding planning._
