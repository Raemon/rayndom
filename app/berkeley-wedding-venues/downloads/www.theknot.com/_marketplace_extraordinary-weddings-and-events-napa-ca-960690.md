Regrettably, my husband and I cannot share a positive experience with Lura from Extraordinary Wedding and Events. Our association with Lura began when we hired her services for ou...

r June 2020 wedding, which, as we all know, had to be postponed due to the pandemic. Approximately 1.5 months before our rescheduled wedding date, we found ourselves faced with some questionable business practices that ultimately led us to sever ties with her prior to our big day. Our initial encounter with Lura took place at a wedding fair in Napa, where she appeared enthusiastic and eager to collaborate with us. As she was also featured on our venue's preferred vendor list, we decided to move forward with her month-of coordination package. However, as time passed, she became increasingly elusive, and her responsiveness to our inquiries noticeably slowed. Around the two-month mark before our wedding, we met with Lura at Encore Rentals, an appointment that seemed promising overall. We left feeling optimistic about the partnership. During our meeting, Lura assured us that she would promptly provide us with a contract and pricing details. Unfortunately, when more than a week passed without any communication, I reached out to her for an update. Her response came ten days later, via Aisle planner, revealing that she had received a quote from Encore, including the cost for Encore staff to handle the setup and breakdown of 280 chairs and 11 tables, which totaled $3,298. Her company offered to undertake the same tasks for a mere $1,618. This raised red flags for us, and a closer examination of the actual contract from Encore revealed no specific estimate for setup and breakdown. Upon contacting Encore directly, they confirmed that these services were typically done by Lura and her staff and therefore not included on their contract with her clients. They however were willing to provide us with a new contract specifying the set up and break down cost which was ONLY $855.25! In essence, Lura's quote was an egregious overcharge, about four times the actual Encore cost, and her team's quote was twice as high. While I understand that it's not uncommon for the wedding industry to mark up services, it should always be done with transparency and honesty. When we confronted Lura about this issue, her explanation cited personal family matters, recent pricing changes at Encore, and an inadvertent copy-pasting error from another contract. While we empathize with personal challenges, it's crucial to maintain professionalism in business dealings. In the end, my husband and I felt that we could no longer trust that Lura had our best interests in mind and ended our business with her. Sadly, Lura declined to refund any of the pre-paid funds, despite services not being rendered. I know I am quite delayed in posting my review, however I feel that my experience is still important for potential clients to know. If you do choose to engage Lura's services, I strongly urge you to scrutinize your contracts and services meticulously. Transparency and integrity in the wedding industry are paramount, and we hope your experience differs from ours.

Lura is truly extraordinary. Her professionalism and attention to detail was obvious to us from the beginning as she helped us find our dream venue (a nonpublic one that we wouldn...

't have found without her). Over the next year, she expertly guided us through the maze of logistics and vendors. Her tact and diplomacy helped smooth over any bumps in the process. She was committed to letting us drive the aesthetics and timeline for the wedding, while providing her expertise and great style and taste all along the way. Lura cares not only about the aesthetic details (the fun part!), but also the logistical ones (e.g., transportation, processionals, etc.). Her experience as a corporate event planner shone through the day of our wedding, which was smooth and flawless from start to finish. We were truly guests at our own wedding. We would be remiss in not mentioning how wonderfully kind Lura is, too. It makes sense she is in the business of love with a heart as big as hers.

Lura was the perfect person to help plan our special day. Living outside of California, we desperately needed someone to help guide us through not only the planning process, but al...

so ensure that we would be taken care of during our big day. Lura did both phenomenally. The thing that pushed us to choose Lura was her philosophy that you and your partner should feel like a guest at your own wedding. And we did feel this way. She was on top of all things and ensured that if anything went wrong, that it was corrected, and we were none the wiser. Additionally, her contacts in the surrounding area, and the relationships she has with them, ensured that we had access to the best vendors on offer. Each vendor we used was so knowledgable, professional, and affordable. Something that every person wants when looking at their budget, and trying to match it up with their dream wedding. The planning process was meticulously documented, and had so much visibility to ensure that everyone knew what was being done or what needed to get done. I especially enjoyed the planning software that was used by each person, so that we all knew who was responsible for what. Lura is also such an amazing person outside of wedding planning. So kind at heart, you will end up being more friends than just having a professional relationship. I highly recommend her and Extraordinary Weddings if your are considering planning your wedding, either in California, or elsewhere.

he photographer at. My initial communication with Lura was delightful- she was very friendly and informative, allowing me to collaborate with her to best prepare for our couples day. Jeannine impressed me with her quick communication and willingness to jump on the phone on the days leading up to the wedding to ensure we had a rock solid game plan for the couple. On the day of the wedding, Jeannine was a rockstar for our couple (and for me!). She worked so hard to ensure the day ran smoothly and everyone was enjoying themselves. And I can’t thank her enough for her kind treatment to us vendors as well- as we tend to get overlooked. I highly recommend hiring Extraordinary Events for your wedding day if you are looking for a team who will treat your event like it’s their own.

iscovering that it was going to be a long time before things will really get better, we decided on go ahead and celebrate with just immediate family members and bridal party who were in the area to abide by COVID regulations and policies. Despite the small number of people at the wedding, it really was a full wedding with 2 ceremonies, photos, and a reception. I felt safe and assured leaving the vision for our day in Lura and Amy's hands. I really appreciated how they checked in with me throughout the day especially when we had to shift some things around in the agenda, and just how flexible they were with the whole planning process in the midst of a pandemic. Lura and Amy were very sweet to work with, and they both really made sure that we had the day that we wanted. And the smiles on their faces every time made such a difference. I also really appreciated how they understood our wanting extra safety precautions due to COVID to keep everyone safe and still made our outdoor wedding beautiful. They knew the importance of small touches that I didn't even think of myself, such as decorating the table where we had our first communion and the signing of our marriage certificate since it was all photographed and videoed. Making us happy was the priority for EW on our wedding day =)

fectly and exactly how I wanted. We got rave reviews from all our guests about it being the most unique wedding they had been to. My Mom originally thought I was nuts for knowing I needed a planner, but at the end she agreed it was the best money we spent. She was a joy to work with and made our day absolutly perfect. So responsive, and several things would not have happend without her. She even found someone who found someone who got us access to the chapel we ended up getting married in! I've planned events for work, and even I got overwhelmed occasionally during the process. It would have been easy to just avoid making decisions and procrastinate, but Lura kept me on track.
