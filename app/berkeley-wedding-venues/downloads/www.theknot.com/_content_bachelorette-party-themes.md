### "Last Rodeo" Bachelorette Party

"The Bride's Last Ride" isn't just a catchy saying, it's also the perfect bachelorette party theme. A ["Last Rodeo" bachelorette party](https://www.theknot.com/content/last-rodeo-bachelorette-party) is ideal for guests of honor who love a countrified party, cowgirl boots and a cowgirl hat to match. Consider playing lots of country music, offering sashes that say "howdy" and putting mechanical bull rides on the itinerary.

### Camp-Themed Bachelorette Party

Who wouldn't want to attend [Camp Bachelorette](https://www.theknot.com/content/camping-bachelorette) on their summer vacay? Sounds pretty fun to us. The best part is that you don't actually have to camp to pull off the theme if you don't want to. Adding a few adventurous activities to the itinerary, like hiking or kayaking, will bring all the outdoorsy vibes you need. Complete with s'mores (served indoors or outdoors) and your drinks of choice, it'll be a girls' trip to remember.

FEATURED VIDEO FROM THE KNOT

### "Bride Gone Wild" Bachelorette Party

Break out your animal print outfits and get ready to host a *wild* safari-themed bachelorette party. As part of the itinerary, you could head to your local zoo or animal sanctuary, _or_ you could bring the safari to life at home by decorating with tropical leaves and faux animal skin rugs. Hand out binoculars and safari helmets to your guests and have a scavenger hunt around the party venue. 

### "Electric Love" Bachelorette Party

Heading out for a night on the town? Might as well incorporate a fun theme. Have your guests sport their most vibrant neon outfits in celebration of you finding your "electric love". Bonus points if you choose a bar or club with a blacklight where your crew can glow in the dark.

### Y2K-Themed Bachelorette Party

Relive your glory days with a [Y2K bachelorette party theme](https://www.theknot.com/content/2000s-bachelorette-party). Dress your crew in matching tracksuits, accessorize your hair with butterfly clips, and choose [bachelorette decorations](https://www.theknot.com/content/bachelorette-bridal-shower-decor) with bright, neon colors to channel the best of the late '90s and early 2000s. (The more Lisa Frank inspired, the better.)

### '90s-Themed Bachelorette Party

Fashion shouldn't be too much of an issue when planning a ['90s bachelorette party](https://www.theknot.com/content/90s-bachelorette-party) that harkens back to those bygone days of nostalgia and Skip-Its. Bring back your childhood and teenage memories by polling the bride and the group for their favorite '90s trends. It can include anything from your favorite TV shows and movies to board games and books. Then, bring the winners to life with swag that screams, "'90s Dream Team" as you make your way through your chosen destination. Make your own photo booth with a Polaroid station.

### '70s-Themed Bachelorette Party

There are two ways you can go about a ['70s bachelorette theme](https://www.theknot.com/content/70s-themed-bachelorette-party). Get ready to boogie and wear disco-era attire like bell bottoms, shirts with billowy sleeves, knee-high boots and vibrant jumpsuits. Of course, you'll need plenty of disco ball decorations. For people who want to go the flower child route, get groovy and adorn your bachelorette party space with daisies, peace signs, and orange, yellow, pink and brown hues.

### Girlhood Weekend Bachelorette Party

What is a bachelorette if not the ultimate girlhood weekend? Plan a classic GNO (read: girls night out), complete with a getting-ready playlist filled with throwbacks. On night two, embrace wholesome bonding activities like a sleepover in the living room with your all-time favorite coming-of-age flicks lined up. (Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants is a must.) You can take turns making signature cocktails inspired by the bride-to-be, wear face masks and fluffy socks, and just chill out together like you used to.

### "Glitz and Glam" Bachelorette Party

If the bride-to-be is all about sparkles, champagne showers and doing things over the top, the [glitz and glam bachelorette theme](https://www.theknot.com/content/glitz-glam-bachelorette-party) is for you. For decor, buy a shimmering photo backdrop, confetti balloons and a glitter welcome banner. For the fits, ask everyone to wear their favorite dazzling chic clothes and tell them the more accessories, the better.

### Mermaid-Themed Bachelorette Party

Has the soon-to-be bride always dreamed of being under the sea? Have you always wanted to be a part of that world? Okay, enough "The Little Mermaid" puns. But seriously, if playing mermaids in the pool was your go-to as a kid, you should have a [last splash-themed celebration](https://www.theknot.com/content/mermaid-bachelorette-party). That means lots of seashells, wearable mermaid tails, sparkling blue backdrops and much more.

### Disco Cowgirl Bachelorette Party

No one said you couldn't combine your favorite bachelorette party theme ideas. Let your country and groovy side merge for a fun night no one will forget by choosing a [disco cowgirl bachelorette party](https://www.theknot.com/content/disco-cowgirl-bachelorette). Wear your trusty cowgirl hat, take out the disco balls and put cow print on everything.

## Unique Bachelorette Party Themes

You deserve a one-of-a-kind theme for your once-in-a-lifetime night. Luckily, we have plenty of unique bachelorette themes to inspire your celebration. From fiesta to space cowgirl, these ideas are guaranteed to get your creative juices flowing.

### "RIP Single Life" Bachelorette Party

Say 'RIP' to your single life with a "Till Death Do Us Party" or "Bride or Die" celebration. Inspired by the phrase ["till death do us part"](https://www.theknot.com/content/until-death-do-us-part-meaning) in traditional marriage vows, this playful party theme is what bach parties are all about—letting loose with your crew before the wedding. A black and silver color palette is a cool way to embrace the theme without losing the celebratory vibes (think: Taylor Swift's Reputation era), alongside skull motifs and fun signage or balloons spelling out the name of the theme. As for attire, we're thinking LBDs.

### "On Cloud Nine" Bachelorette Party

*Dreaming* of an aesthetic bachelorette party inspired by one of Pinterest's top trends? You'll love an "On Cloud Nine" bachelorette party. For this whimsical take on a classic slumberparty, guests will sport sky blue PJs while the guest of honor wears white (inspired by clouds, of course.) Complete the theme with a tower of blue cocktails, each topped with white cotton candy.

### Denim and Diamonds Bachelorette Party

This bachelorette party theme is exactly what it sounds like. Guests will throw on their best Canadian tuxedos, pair them with blingy jewelry and get ready to hit the town. Your matching outfits will make for unforgettable photo-ops! 

### Italian Bachelorette Party Theme

Amalficore is the latest viral aesthetic and it's the perfect vibe for a bach party, whether you're flying to Italy or not. Three words that'll help you pull it off perfectly: relaxed, colorful and coastal. Light, airy table linens, lemon or olive branch motifs, blue and white color palettes, rattan and jute materials, and pops of citrus hues like orange and yellow will transport your squad to the Amalfi Coast no matter where you are. Aperol spritzes and Mediterranean-inspired grazing boards will add a delicious finishing touch.

### "Girls Gone Mild" Bachelorette Party

If you and your crew aren't the biggest party animals, your celebration might look a little different, and that's totally okay! Since the bach party is one of those wedding events where we encourage couples to pursue their favorite interests and hobbies, those who prefer yoga, relaxation, massages and overall balance should consider a relaxing, wellness-themed bachelorette party, complete with green juice cocktails and farm-to-table meals. Also in this category are [spa-themed bachelorette parties,](https://www.theknot.com/content/spa-bachelorette-party-ideas) including massages, group facials and manicures. Start the day with a high-intensity workout or a hot yoga class so everyone is centered before the wedding.

### Final Fiesta-Themed Bachelorette Party

It's time for some tasty margaritas with your señoritas. Make it extra picante with spicy cocktails, homemade guacamole, a Mexican food menu and fiesta-themed party decorations. If you want to be extra in the best way, order a piñata so your besties can walk away with sweet bachelorette party favors.

### Find your kind of venue

From barns to ballrooms, discover reception venues that feel like you.

### Space Cowgirl-Themed Bachelorette Party

If you spend even five minutes on [wedding TikTok](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-planning-tiktok), you'll probably come across the [space cowgirl aesthetic](https://www.theknot.com/content/space-cowgirl-bachelorette-party): a blend of boho-western wear and futuristic celestial flair. Provide your crew with cowgirl hats and fringe accessories, and ask them to don cute space buns hairstyles and metallic outfits. Don't forget a shimmering streamer backdrop for photo opportunities. It's like the [Kacey Musgraves](https://www.theknot.com/content/kacey-musgraves-maid-of-honor-wedding-photos) song "Space Cowboy" personified.

### Color-Themed Bachelorette Party

This one is exactly what it sounds like. Simply choose a color (the bride's favorite, if you want to show off how well you know her) and make that the theme of your party. For example, guests at a pink-themed bachelorette party could take inspiration from iconic pink outfits (think: the pink jumpsuits from Barbie, Molly Ringwald's Pretty in Pink prom dress, and anything worn by Miss Piggy). It's as cool or hilarious as you make it, and finding decor will be easy.

### Disney Princess-Themed Bachelorette Party

The next best thing to actually being at Disney World or Disneyland for a bachelorette getaway is having your girls channel their [inner Disney princesses](https://www.theknot.com/content/disney-bachelorette-party-accessories) all weekend long. Disney has long built an empire of partnerships, meaning everything from face masks to wine glasses and shot glasses is fair game for this bachelorette party idea. So throw on a princess-themed shirt, pour some wine in a Cinderella glass, and turn on your favorite Disney classics.

## Funny Bachelorette Themes

If you want to ensure you and your crew have plenty of laughs on your bach night, a funny bachelorette party theme is the way to go. The best ideas are ones that will have your onlookers rolling with laughter, and your camera roll filled with outrageous shots from the night. Below are some of our favorite ideas for the group with a sense of humor.

![Bach island bachelorette theme collage](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/2f325d2f-b365-4519-b562-6880d0267eed~rs_768.h)

###  _Love Island_ Bachelorette Party

A hot new bombshell is about to enter married life! Send her off with a bachelorette party inspired by the reality show, _Love Island_. Transform your party space into "Bach Island" by opting for beachy decor in bright shades of turquoise, hot pink and neon green. Your itinerary should be filled with games played on the show like "Snog, Marry, Pie" and "Truth or Dare". You can even have a confessional booth where guests can record messages for the bride.

### "Wig Out" Bachelorette Party

Want to wig out with your crew ahead of the big day? You're in luck. No matter where your bachelorette party is taking place, it's easy to turn it into a wig-themed event. All you have to do is ask each of your guests to arrive with a wild, over-the-top wig that reflects their unique personality. From there, there are countless wig-related activities to enjoy. For example, you could have a wig runway show and vote on the best wig.

### "Until They're Old and Gray" Bachelorette Party

You don't have to wait until you're actually old and gray to enjoy some of the perks of retired life. With this bachelorette party theme, you and your crew can transport yourselves 50 years into the future for one night. Everyone can put on gray wigs and night gowns to enjoy an evening of bingo, knitting and gossiping. Then, head out dancing to show everyone that granny's got moves! 

### "Last Night of Freedom" Bachelorette Party

Let freedom ring with this funny bachelorette party. Have each member of your group dress up as a different founding father. (Yes, we're talking powdered wigs, breeches, stockings and all.) Then, hit the town together and prepare to get stopped for photos along the way. You can even have one member of the group fly an American flag to keep everyone together.

### "This Witch is Getting Hitched" Bachelorette Party

If you feel like your best friends would've been your coven in another life, try throwing a [witch-themed party](https://www.theknot.com/content/witch-bachelorette-party). Shop together for the witchy outfits as a fun group activity, or take your theme to another level by letting guests choose a special power to incorporate into their look. Plus, you might be surprised to find how many decorations are out there for this idea.

###  _Shrek_ Bachelorette Party

If you and your squad believe ogres are like onions, then you should definitely have a Shrek bach bash. This funny bachelorette party theme can involve everyone dressing up as their favorite character or wearing all-green attire with Shrek ear headbands. To truly get the mood, let "All Star," by Smash Mouth be the soundtrack for the night.

### Famous [Partner's Name]-Themed Bachelorette Party

This bachelorette party theme is straight from TikTok, and it's perfect for groups who aren't into traditional themes. For one night of your bash, invite your friends to come dressed as a television, book or movie character or celebrity who shares the same first name as the bride's partner's name. If the bride's future spouse's name is Chris, the crew can dress as Chris Hemsworth, Pine, Evans and even -tina Aguilera. The more innovative your take on "Chris," the better. The best part is that the bride can dress up as her partner if she chooses. This kind of bachelorette party will create some iconic memories.

### Dating Type Bachelorette Party Theme

Something that's possibly even funnier than dressing up as famous people with the same first name as the bride's future spouse? Dressing up as your "type," aka the kind of person you would typically go out with on a date. It doesn't have to be current, either. Guests can choose to wear outfits inspired by their usual "type" in their younger years (before you all got older and wiser.) Or, take the opportunity to dress as your current significant others—the rules are what you make them.

## TV & Movie Bachelorette Themes

If your squad loves watching classic [bachelorette movies](https://www.theknot.com/content/bachelorette-party-netflix-movies) and popular television shows together, you might also love dressing up like your favorite characters for one night. From rom-coms to musicals, we have all the inspiration you'll need to plan a TV or movie-themed bachelorette party below.

![The Princess Diaries bachelorette theme collage](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/c8630603-643d-4cc2-80cf-706e041197cf~rs_768.h)

_Photos: TKI, CONRHOD ZONIO, Getty, LOGAN COLE Photography, Cake by Kenna, Tyler Branch Photo,__Design: Natalie Romine_

###  _The Princess Diaries_ Bachelorette Party

Me? A bride? Shut up! That's exactly what your bride-to-be bestie will be saying when you throw her a nostalgia-filled The Princess Diaries-themed bachelorette party inspired by one of the movies that made her childhood. If the bach party is more than one night, you could embrace the Y2K aesthetic on night one and the royal vibes on night two. As for the food, it has to be pizza and corn dogs.

###  _Mamma Mia!_ Bachelorette Party

A [Mamma Mia bachelorette party](https://www.theknot.com/content/mamma-mia-bachelorette-party) theme is arguably one of the best since this musical movie is about a woman preparing to get married in beautiful Greece (plus, lots of other drama). Playing all of Abba's hits is a must, especially "Dancing Queen." Disco ball decorations, '70s attire and portable karaoke microphones party favors will make for the perfect Mamma Mia!-themed celebration.

###  _The Parent Trap_ Bachelorette Party

Any nostalgic bride will love a bachelorette party inspired by the 1998 film, _The Parent Trap_. Executing this theme is all about striking a balance between the laidback vibes of summer camp and the glamor of London. If you're hosting the party at home, you can decorate different rooms to reflect the various movie locations. Take your party to the next level by hiring an ear piercing specialist to come give you and your crew some matching bling.

###  _Legally Blonde_ Bachelorette Party

Grab some pink balloons and a banner that reads "Legally Bride" and get ready to host a Legally Blonde theme bachelorette party. You can create a photo booth featuring various movie-inspired props, like law books and a plush dog that looks like Bruiser Woods. For the activities, you can give each other manicures and write compliments for the bride in a DIY "Snap Cup" station.

###  _Euphoria_ Bachelorette Party

###  _Mean Girls_ Bachelorette Party

You're not a regular wedding party, you're a cool wedding party. Grab your burn book and throw a Mean Girls-inspired bachelorette party that would make Regina George proud. Bonus points if you have your friends dress up like the movie's beloved characters, from Cady Heron to Aaron Samuels.

###  _Harry Potter_ Bachelorette Party

For the bride-to-be who uses "Wingardium Leviosa" regularly, a [Harry Potter-inspired party](https://www.theknot.com/content/harry-potter-bachelorette-party) awaits. Supplement this cute theme with a fresh batch of Butterbeer, spells for decorations and cocktails inspired by potions.

###  _Clueless_ Bachelorette Party

As if there was a better bachelorette party theme. Alicia Silverstone joined TikTok in 2021, but everyone else is partaking in the throwback aesthetic that Cher Horowitz and her besties started in the 1990s. Whether you want ruched dresses inspired by Cher or Mel, or you're looking for swag that reads, "She's a full-on Monet," seek and you shall find.

###  _Friends_ Bachelorette Party

Arrange your own Central Perk inside your bach pad with a [Friends-themed bachelorette](https://www.theknot.com/content/friends-theme-bachelorette-party).

###  _Gossip Girl_ Bachelorette Party

If you're a [Blair Waldorf](https://www.theknot.com/content/leighton-meester-adam-brody) or Serena Van Der Woodsen in real life, you'll want to gather your finest headbands and headscarves for a Gossip Girl-themed bachelorette party. If you're in New York, start with a scavenger hunt along NYC's Upper East Side for the most iconic filming locations (including food and cocktail spots). Don't forget a photo opportunity in Manhattan's Central Park, where Blair and Chuck got married.

###  _Real Housewives_ Bachelorette Party

One thing's certain: a [Real Housewives-themed bachelorette](https://www.theknot.com/content/bravo-bachelorette-party) will be far from an actual "Scary Island" experience. If you and your girls love curling up to Bravo shows (even beyond the scope of the Housewives franchise), the options are endless depending on the city's proximity. If you're in L.A., a must is setting reservations at PUMP, SUR or TomTom for longtime followers of Vanderpump Rules. A New York City bash should include an outing to The Russian Tea Room and AOA Bar and Grill, where RHONY's Ramona Singer is now a partner. Chase it all with a SkinnyGirl margarita and marathon of the most outstanding episodes, ranked from most dramatic to semi-dramatic.

###  _The Office_ Bachelorette Party

You're likely not traveling to Scranton, Pennsylvania for your bachelorette party but that doesn't matter. Transform your bach pad into Dunder Mifflin and throw a themed event that even Michael Scott would love.

###  _Bridesmaids_ Bachelorette Party

There's a touch of irony in this bachelorette party theme. For fans of the flick, leave the drama aside and lean into the hilariousness of the 2011 comedy, [Bridesmaids.](https://www.theknot.com/content/painfully-relatable-bridesmaids-quotes) Try to find invitations with an illustration of Kristen Wiig's character delivering her all-encompassing "I'm ready to paaaartyy" phrase.

###  _Breakfast at Tiffany's_ Bachelorette Party

Make Holly Golightly proud with [this themed idea](https://www.theknot.com/content/breakfast-at-tiffanys-bridal-shower). Ask the bride to bring their favorite little black dress or whichever color she chooses, a pair of bug-eyed sunglasses and ask the bachelorette party lead to stock up on croissants, coffee and a mimosa bar. If you're feeling extra adventurous, build a Tiffany & Co.-worthy backdrop for this classic theme party idea. Then, play the film or any other classic Hepburn flick in the background.

###  _Hocus-Pocus_ Bachelorette Party 

For those who want to go beyond a Halloween theme, there's a specific witchy route you can take. Have everyone dress as their favorite character from the classic childhood film, [_Hocus Pocus_](https://www.theknot.com/content/hocus-pocus-bachelorette-party) (it's okay if there's more than one Winifred), create tasty potions (a.k.a. cocktails) and decorate the bach pad with witch hats, brooms, cobwebs and more.

###  _The Great Gatsby_ Bachelorette Party

It is the Roaring '20s once again, and a Gatsby-themed bachelorette party would be fun for a group that tends to dress to the nines. Ask your guests to source their best flapper-style attire and decorate the party space with jazz-age accents like metallic brushes and swirl detailing. Plus, those bachelorette party invitations should come with a quote by F. Scott Fitzgerald.

###  _Moulin Rouge_ Bachelorette Party

If you want to set a scene straight out of Moulin Rouge, consider this idea that marries the Bohemian era with the Gilded Age in the Parisian neighborhood of Montmartre. You'll want to start with that iconic windmill, Hollywood-inspired lettering and spotlight motifs.

### Rom-Com-Inspired Bachelorette Party

Paging Nancy Meyers. Whether your favorite romantic comedy is You've Got Mail or the latest [J.Lo hit, Marry Me](https://www.theknot.com/content/marry-me-movie), romantic comedies provide lots of content opportunities for the bachelorette weekend. Movies to pull ideas from include Will Smith's Hitch or Jennifer Lopez's runaway hit The Wedding Planner. Other funny options for sayings and hotspots (especially in Manhattan) include Hathaway and Kate Hudson's Bride Wars to How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days. Imagine the decor possibilities!

### Old Hollywood Bachelorette Party

Any glamorous bride-to-be will enjoy a bach party with an Old Hollywood aesthetic. Ornate details with plenty of sparkle will bring the theme to life. Stick with classic colors like black, gold and silver to keep the upscale vibe in check and make sure everyone gets the dress code memo and packs something seriously showstopping. Here's a fun activity to kick off the evening: Buy miniature Oscar trophies and hold a pretend awards ceremony with hilarious categories for guests to vote in and win.

## Music Bachelorette Themes

For groups that love having [karaoke nights](https://www.theknot.com/content/best-karaoke-songs) together, we recommend throwing a party that involves plenty of tunes. There are countless themes that are centered around music and we rounded up some of our favorites below. Even if you don't find your top musician on our list, you can still use these music bachelorette party themes as inspiration for an event based on your fav artist or genre.

### Taylor Swift Bachelorette Party

Congrats, you found your _lover!_ You may or may not make it to Cornelia Street, where she once fell in love, but you can still let sparks fly with a [Taylor Swift-themed bachelorette party](https://www.theknot.com/content/taylor-swift-bachelorette). Pay homage to her top songs and albums by gathering your girls in [bachelorette party shirts](https://www.theknot.com/content/bachelorette-party-shirts) that read "Champagne Problems" or "Lover." Blast Midnights on repeat as you make drinks before you head out for the night, and in short, gather those swan, unicorn and Olivia Benson pool floats so that you can throw a party worthy of [Taylor Swift](https://www.theknot.com/content/taylor-swift-relationship). (How meta!)

### Chappell Roan Bachelorette Party

Going to the *Chappell*? Channel your inner midwest princess with a Chappell Roan party to celebrate. For this theme, you'll need a vibrant playlist filled with Chappel Roan hits. Decorate the party space in pink decor to create your very own "Pink Pony Club". Finally, ask your attendees to show up in drag queen-inspired makeup and outfits (the more over-the-top, the better.)

### Beyoncé Bachelorette Party

There are so many amazing ways to approach a [Beyoncé-themed event](https://www.theknot.com/content/beyonce-themed-bachelorette-party). Whether you pick up signs that [quote Beyoncé's](https://www.theknot.com/content/beyonce-lyrics-captions) "Drunk In Love" or "CUFF IT," get your ladies into formation with swag they can wear repeatedly. And now that Queen Bey has blessed us all with Cowboy Carter, you can even blend the Beyoncé theme with a Western vibe. For the bride-to-be, we love bach party shirts and swimsuits that read, "Feyoncé."

### Sabrina Carpenter Bachelorette Party

Your time as a bride is "Short n' Sweet" but you can take full advantage of it by throwing a fun and flirty Sabrina Carpenter-themed bachelorette party. In true Sabrina fashion, guests should don satin slip dresses, feather-trimmed robes or even lingerie. Another key element of this theme is an espresso martini tower, inspired by her hit song, "Espresso". You'll spend the night singing karaoke, dancing and taking turns seeing who can come up with the most outrageous "Juno" pose.

### Harry Styles Bachelorette Party

There are countless ways to throw a Harry Styles-themed bachelorette party, whether you take inspiration from his song "Golden" and deck out your space in gold, or go for a "Watermelon Sugar" vibe and lean into the fruit aesthetic. What matters most is that you have a jamming playlist complete with all Harry's hits, plus plenty of One Direction throwbacks.

### Dolly Parton Bachelorette Party

Speaking of Cowboy Carter, who doesn't love a Southern belle with a heart of gold? That's why you should focus the bach party on [Dolly Parton](https://www.theknot.com/content/dolly-parton-bachelorette), the queen of country music. Play her hits and deep cuts all night long, and put on your cowgirl boots. We also love the idea of each guest dressing up as a different Dolly from one of her album covers.

### Drake Bachelorette Party

Ask the bridesmaids to DIY a giant Drake cutout because this is a trending theme that even has its own category on Etsy. For a Drake-themed party, you'll want to purchase bachelorette party decor and signs that quote [Drake song lyrics](https://www.theknot.com/content/drake-lyrics-captions) from "Worst Behavior" and "24-Hour Champagne Diet."

### Elvis Bachelorette Party 

What could be more fitting for your bach party theme than the singer of 2023's [most popular first dance song](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-songs-the-knot-spotify-playlist)? Elvis has so many love songs you can jam to all night long, including upbeat tracks like "Burning Love." And who's going to pass up the opportunity to embrace a colorful and delightfully retro '60s aesthetic? Nobody, that's who.

### Disco Fever Bachelorette Party

The '70s are back in a big way, particularly in the form of [disco fever parties](https://www.theknot.com/content/disco-bachelorette-party). Stock up on disco balls big and small to deck out your space or hotel room, and pay homage to the maximal era by wearing bell-bottom jeans, groovy patterns and blown-out hairstyles. You'll have so much fun celebrating the bride's final disco.

## Food & Drink Bachelorette Themes

If you're a foodie or a cocktail lover, you can incorporate that into your festivities by choosing a food or drink-inspired bachelorette party theme. The ideas below will allow you to get creative with your food and drink menu as well as the decor.

### "Margs & Matrimony" Bachelorette Party

Nothing goes together like margaritas and matrimony (except you and your soon-to-be spouse, of course.) Celebrate your upcoming nuptials with a margarita-themed bachelorette party. For the color scheme, you'll want to stick to citrus-inspired shades like lime green, yellow and orange. Create a margarita-making station complete with all the garnishes and rimmers you can think of. 

### "She Found Her Honey" Bachelorette Party

How about a honey-themed bachelorette party for the "bride to bee"? This theme is perfect for an intimate brunch or cozy weekend getaway. Start with a warm color palette for your attire and decor (shades of yellow and gold are the way to go.) Create adorable bee motifs out of paper to use as props for photos. As for the itinerary, you could do a honey tasting, create bouquets out of locally-grown flowers or relax with honey-inspired face masks.

### "She's The Cherry on Top" Bachelorette Party

This *sweet* bachelorette party theme is perfect for a summer celebration. All you'll need is a bunch of red decorations. (**Psst:** You can create DIY cherry balloons by tying two red balloons together and hanging them up with green ribbon.) For the menu, consider fruit-forward treats, like cherry pie, and of course, a signature cherry cocktail.

### "She's the Zest" Lemon Bachelorette Party

Celebrate your bestie finding her main squeeze with a [lemon-themed](https://www.theknot.com/content/lemon-themed-bridal-shower) bachelorette party. Stock up on bright yellow decor and serve citrusy drinks and snacks to nail this zesty theme.

### Wine Tasting Bachelorette Party

Go to a local winery or restaurant and [have a wine tasting](https://www.theknot.com/content/winery-bachelorette-party)—even better if you pair each round with delicious cheese, fruit and charcuterie boards. You can also hire a sommelier to come to someone's home and do a private tasting, so nobody has to worry about driving home.

### High Tea Bachelorette Party

Grab your fascinators. If your friend wants an elegant affair, consider a high tea party, complete with lace doilies, finger sandwiches, petit fours, scones, clotted cream and a variety of tea. You can easily host tea in someone's home or splurge by making reservations at a fancy tearoom. Some high-end hotel properties even offer etiquette classes to accompany group high tea sessions, so reserve ahead.

### Doughnut-Themed Bachelorette Party

Place those orders for bachelorette party shirts and decor with "Doughnut Forget Us" messaging. If your bride-to-be can't get enough of this treat, you may want to lean into stocking up on Krispy Kreme, Dunkin' Donuts or any local favorites for an experiential getaway. The bridal party will enjoy party cups and decorations with doughnut motifs.

### Foodie-Themed Bachelorette Party

Talk to the bride about her favorite cuisine and then attend a cooking class based on her preference—Japanese, Mexican and Italian are always big hits. If you have a bigger budget, hire a private chef to cook for the bachelorette and throw a luxe dinner party at someone's home. Wine (sake, beer, cocktails) pairings are a must and let the conversation flow.

## Destination Bachelorette Themes

It doesn't matter if you're preparing to go to one of these locations or want to show your love for it. You should try one of these destination-centered bachelorette party themes for your memorable weekend.

### Vegas-Themed Bachelorette Party

Ready to be "Lucky in Love"? Regardless of whether you select [Las Vegas](https://www.theknot.com/content/las-vegas-bachelorette-party) as your bachelorette destination, you'll want to throw on your glitziest outfit and take a seat at the table for a casino-themed bachelorette. This next-level concept involves card games and themed sunglasses to conceal your true expressions as you put on your best poker face.

### Beach-Themed Bachelorette Party

Not to be confused with a mermaid-themed event, but a [beach-themed bachelorette party](https://www.theknot.com/content/beach-themed-bachelorette-party) is a classic way to bond before the nuptials. Head to the seaside with your bride tribe for a mellow (or action-packed) weekend. After all, those rosé cans are extra delicious in a cooler with fresh fruit. If you want to take the added step, dress your entire crew in matching swimsuits or cover-ups with the bride shining in white or her color of choice.

### Lake-Themed Bachelorette Party

Don't live near the coast? Celebrate your love on the lake! Get your crew together for a fun-filled day (or entire weekend) on the water. The itinerary can include boating, canoeing and relaxing in innertubes. End the day with a bonfire where everyone can roast their own hotdogs and s'mores and share some of their funniest memories they've made with the bride. (Psst: Read up on all our favorite [lake captions](https://www.theknot.com/content/lake-captions) so you'll be prepared when it comes time to post your photo dump from the event.)

### Club-Themed Bachelorette Party

Whether it's a [pool party](https://www.theknot.com/content/bachelorette-pool-party-ideas) at a day club, a drag show, bottle service at a swanky nightclub or something else entirely, a fun-loving bride will say "I do" to this theme. Reserve a table for your group and dress in themed attire or your most dance-worthy outfit.

### Desert-Themed Bachelorette Party

An Arizona or [Palm Springs bachelorette getaway](https://www.theknot.com/content/palm-springs-bachelorette-party) is within reach, especially when you opt for a desert-themed party. Regardless of where you plan to throw your event, if cactus motifs and palm trees are a favorite of your bride-to-be, consider a desert-themed event stocked with a bar to serve as your oasis.

### Tropical Forest-Themed Bachelorette Party

Some groups love cheetah prints and Monstera leaves. If that's the case, a tropical or jungle-themed party, cute printables and rainforest home plants can create a lush environment and Instagram-friendly vignettes. Ask each partygoer to dress as their favorite tropical animal for even more fun.
