We had the most incredible experience getting married at Léal Vineyards — I truly can’t say enough wonderful things about the entire team and venue. From start to finish, everythin...

g was handled with the highest level of professionalism and organization. Kristen was my lead (and day-of) coordinator and answered my endless stream of questions with quick responses every single time. She went above and beyond to make sure every detail was perfect and that we felt completely taken care of throughout the entire planning process and on our wedding day. One of the things that made Léal such an easy and stress-free choice is that they provide catering, floral and décor services, and a DJ—so there’s no need to juggle multiple vendors. The food was incredible, the DJ kept the dance floor packed all night, and the floral and décor team brought my vision to life so beautifully while being flexible with our budget. The venue itself is absolutely stunning. We got married at Lavanda, in front of the pond and hillside vines, and it was simply breathtaking. So many of our guests told us it was the most beautiful wedding they had ever attended! Another huge perk was the estate homes on the property. Our entire bridal party was able to stay there for the weekend, and we hosted our rehearsal dinner on site, which Léal also catered for 40 guests. The homes are very charming and spacious. Our wedding day truly could not have gone any smoother—it was everything we hoped for and more. We’re beyond grateful to the Léal team for their generosity, flexibility, and the joy they brought to our day.

Michelle who was nothing but amazing the whole entire time. She was so sweet and very fun to tour with. Not to mention the hardest part was choosing which venue we wanted because they were all so beautiful. If you’re looking for a venue, I would highly recommend coming here. They also have two estates that you can rent for your friends and family who drive far. This Venue has everything that you’re looking for and more! Thank you again for an amazing experience and we can’t wait for our wedding in 2026! \- Dezare & Anthony

ollectively understood exactly what our wedding plan was. Every question, email, text was answered and they never left us waiting. The food at our wedding was exceptional and all our guests commented on the quality! We went with Filet Mignon, Salmon, Tortellini, Vegetable Risotto and the Seasonal Vegetables, DELICIOUS and worth every penny! Leal does a scheduled food tasting for their menu, so you can try everything ahead of time. Michelle and Erin were our go-to Wedding Coordinators on our wedding day and they were fantastic! You can feel that they actually love their jobs and enjoy working for Leal (that makes a difference, and hey, it's not an easy job!). Michelle has a heart of pure gold, truly she's an angel! Leal was so accommodating and flexible, they truly approached our questions with an open mind and worked with us to create our most perfect day! We also specifically asked for DJ Ano! People may recognize him from many Leal events as he is one of their top choice DJ's! We had gone to many events at the Granada theatre and DJ Ano was the host and he was so good, so we specifically requested him! Leal truly is a unique and special place for my husband and I. We don't appreciate or like the feeling of sleezy sales people. So we were initially unsure of how things would be while wedding planning in general. Leal really does hire unique woman like Michelle and Erin who don't have a phony bone in their body. They are kind, warm and compassionate women, not one ounce of phony/aggressive/fake vibes. Overall, I wouldn't do anything differently. Our wedding experience was easy peasy, and they handled everything so that our day went so smoothly. Michelle, Erin and Ano are truly irreplaceable. You can train anyone to work in any job, but you can't train someone to have good character. Their character is so genuine, warm and accommodating! God bless you guys!

I would love to be writing a great review right now but I’m very disappointed with the professionalism and organization of the Leal team. Everything seemed great leading up to our ...

wedding day. We met with the Leal team and their Luxe design team multiple times over the months leading up to our wedding, along with documented chatting through aisle planner. The day of the wedding came and something seemed off. They didn’t seem ready or organized what so ever! They allowed us to make a seating chart so we could assign our guests seats. The reception came and everything was screwed up. My immediate family didn’t have seats, friends didn’t have seats. There were no table numbers put out for our guests to find their table or seat. They assured me everything was fine and all of this was/would be taken care of. My sister stepped in to offer help and assistance in getting guests to their right seats and their response was “it doesnt really matter just have guests sit down”. There was a huge lag in our grand entrance as all of this was happening. Our assigned day of coordinator took us to the side of the venue in a golf cart and told us to wait and left us there for 30 mins and never returned. A new lady came on board and kept trying to push us to have drinks to somehow make up for whatever was happening behind the scene as we were left in the dark. We paid for a his and her custom drinks and they were served out of a large pre mixed pitcher. We paid for a champagne tower for guest to arrive and grab a glass of champagne.. the glasses were empty upon guests arrival. Our coordinator disappeared for a long period of our wedding and then returned at the end apologizing. We were given choices on how we wanted decor done from the decor team and they didn’t do the options I choose. They decided to do what they felt would look best. They was a major lag in getting this going between ceremony and reception due to the confusion with the seating chart. We paid for 2 venues as we wanted the best of both locations for ceremony and reception and ultimately we were extremely let down. Unfortunately we can’t redo our wedding day but it was the unprofessionalism of the team the day of that really made it hard. The layout was not what we expected or discussed multiple times prior to the wedding day. It just seems everyone was not on the same page! I tried to enjoy my evening as best as I could but ultimately after spending so much money and time and effort coordinating, I was hoping for a much better turn out. They wait until the last minute to do everything. Not to add but they had left over decor form a wedding the night before in our reception area. They made us feel like we were just a number in the line up and just another check coming in. The venue is very beautiful but be aware that this could happen to you too! Ask as many questions as possible about every detail to ensure things will go as discussed and planned. Unfortunately, nothing is ever perfect and that wasn’t my goal or standard but the things that went wrong could of easily been avoided or fixed by the staff.

, the vibe, and all the ideas the staff had to help make our vision come to life. Throughout the process of planning our wedding, the staff was so responsive and timely. They have their own internal website to help you plan and keep you organized, which was so helpful, especially because I can barely plan a birthday party but took on planning the entire wedding myself. On our wedding day, our coordinators went above and beyond. I was able to fully relax and enjoy my day. The views from Olea were STUNNING. It was the absolute best day of our lives and we couldn't have had such an amazing day without Kristen, Melissa, Niamh, and the rest of the coordinating staff and Luxe Design staff who played so many roles behind the scenes!

I would give it 4.5 stars in my honest opinion. The estate homes are quite spacious. Each estate house has four rooms and three bathrooms, so if you have a lot of people in the bri...

dal party, I would recommend having some extra air mattresses. Unfortunately, the bridal house has more natural lighting than the men’s house, so for getting ready pictures of the groom, I suggest looking for areas with more lighting, as the groom’s house lacks natural lighting. There is also plenty of parking available. The space for the rehearsal dinner is outdoors and connected to the estate house, perfect for hosting up to 70 people. We had the taco buffet, and the food was really good. During the grand tasting, we found that some plates were good and some were just okay. We chose the best of what they offered, and it was actually really good. I got the steak and chicken marsala, and all of my guests enjoyed it too. The service was flawless, from putting the plates on the table to picking them up and making sure the tables were constantly clean. All the flowers and decorations provided by Luxe met my expectations. They covered essential items such as table decor, photo booth, sofas, and flowers. I felt that it was a little overpriced, but if you have the ability to extend the budget for decor and flowers, it’s worth it. The DJ was amazing and really made the night really special. The day-of coordinator provided by Leal did a fantastic job. Everything went very smoothly, and she constantly checked on both of us to make sure everything was what we wanted throughout the entire wedding day. She even helped our photographer transport equipment from one venue to the other. During our initial wedding consultation, we were assigned a day-of coordinator. When we email her during the first few months after booking she went MIA. However, she eventually left the company, and we were assigned a different coordinator without being informed about the change. The venue assured us that they would not host any other events on our wedding day if we booked with them, but a week before our wedding, the venue informed us that they were hosting a Friday the 13th party at a different wedding venue (Olea), which was upsetting as it contradicted their earlier promise. Thankfully, we didn’t notice any disruptions on our wedding day, but it was a frustrating situation to deal with. At the end of the day I loved my wedding and how everything went really smooth and amazing on the day of the wedding. My guests keep talking everything about the wedding (venue, food, service, music)

I would highly recommend selecting Léal Vineyards for your venue - an all-inclusive dream! They take care of everything - the food, alcohol, decor, florals, rentals, DJ... it was ...

such a stress-saver. We rented the Estate Homes as well, and was able to provide accommodations for us, our parents, and our entire wedding party on-site. Our coordinator, Melissa, was incredibly helpful and responsive. I felt like I could customize everything the way I wanted, and was not limited in my options (as can be the reputation for "all inclusive" venues). The wedding day went off without a hitch, and our guests are still talking about how amazing, fun, and smooth our wedding was!

Erin and Rachel were amazing to work with - professional every step of the way and so patient with my millions of questions. On the wedding day, Erin's guidance as our coordinator ensured that everything went as smoothly as possible. She was just so reassuring and sweet - especially when I (as the bride) was a nervous wreck! Communications were always timely and consistent - Aisle Planner was a great tool to help keep us organized. Leal ensured that our spring wedding at Hacienda was everything I'd ever dreamed of!

Day of my wedding she made sure myself, my husband and my photographer were hydrated while we were rooming around the venue taking pictures. And SHE was also riding us around in a golf cart. She is amazing! I definitely felt very special on my wedding day. My decorations was exactly what I wanted. Nicole and her team did an great job. If your looking for a wedding venue don't look any further. Leal Vineyard has multiple areas for you to choose from to get married or to have your reception. I highly recommend this venue!

y to have our dreams come true! Christina was our ANGEL!! She truly deserves the highest recognition her dedication and true care for my fiancé and I. She made sure we were happy and above all stress free. I couldn't have asked for a more perfect experience! Our wedding was Sunday 9/27/20, one of the hottest days, but everything was flawless! The decor done by Nicole and her talented team left me in tears walking down the isle. Even the venue manager Luis went out of his way to get my family umbrellas to fight the sun. The food was incredible, people wanted seconds! Sergio, our DJ incorporated both of our cultures to make our night an unforgettable party. We are still speechless with the hotels VIP service, catering to our every need! We can't wait to plan our next event with this amazing team just to see them all again!! We love them all like family!

I got married at Leal earlier this month (during Covid) and our wedding turned out BEAUTIFUL (thanks to Nicole & her design team), and everything ran smoothly, thanks to Christina ...

& Ayumi! Christina and her team helped take care of all of the details, including all of the additional elements related to social distancing, and all of our guests felt safe and enjoyed themselves. Anything that you asked of them, they took care of, which we really appreciated when trying to juggle so many things on our wedding day. I also highly recommend renting the Estate Homes on the property, as they host your rehearsal dinner and it is a great place to get ready & take photos the day of the wedding. Overall, all of the departments at Leal were very helpful & responsive throughout the wedding planning process, and even with having to postpone once due to Covid, Erin & Rachel helped us to find a new date that worked for us, since we didn't want to wait until next year to get married. We are very happy with our decision to get married at Leal and would highly recommend this wedding venue!

I was fortunate enough to photograph a wedding at Leal Vineyards at Olea. The coordinators Christina & Ayumi are absolutely amazing never missing a beat. They made the whole day go...

so smoothly, so that the bride and groom could fully enjoy their wedding day. They went the extra mile and would check in with the bride, groom, guest, and even me to make sure we were doing good through out the whole day. Christina personally drove me around with the bride and groom to the best locations around the property and made the experience for not just me but the bride and groom so easy. If you are looking for a place that will go above and beyond to make sure you day is planned out to the very last detail and executed just how you want it I would recommend you look no further. Can't wait to photograph more weddings here and work with the Leal team again!

Our daughter’s wedding was two years in the making. We wanted to eliminate as much stress as possible that is usually associated with most big weddings. First off, Leal Vineyards h...

as stunning views. They offer 4 venues at their Hollister location. Our daughter chose the Lavanda venue which is breathtaking. Lavanda includes a waterfall, large pond with water sprout, manicured lawn, full length bar, large covered canopy area, views of the wine cave, s’mores bar, and of course grapevines. Leal Vineyards offered inclusive amenities that were not found anywhere else such as: Their own bake shop, 3 estate homes, decor facilities, on-site wedding coordinators, photo booth, photographers, etc.. The list goes on...and the fact that Leal wines are exceptional made this venue a no-brainer. All the on-site venders worked effectively in conjunction with one another. Dennise, the wedding coordinator, kept everyone in the wedding party focused and on track. Her attention to detail stands second to none. Ultimately Dennise’s goal was to make sure the Bride and Groom had the wedding of their dreams and that the event was flawless. She accomplished those goals and much more. As the Brides parents we based some possible concerns and Dennise would smile and say “Don’t worry, I got this”. And she did! Nothing seemed impossible for her to handle and we can’t thank her enough for making our daughter and son-in-laws wedding blissfully memorable. Luis, the general manager, is another key factor in the success of the wedding and the prior rehearsal dinner. Both Dennise and Luis collaborated seamlessly to achieve the effects we imagined and turned them into reality. Kudos to all the hard working people at Leal Vineyards for all their help. It did not go unnoticed. Guests at the wedding have posted several compliments such as, the perfect wedding, best wedding ever, Leal is gorgeous, OMG Beautiful! My husband and I highly recommended Leal Vineyards, the staff and management for their 5 star service and professionalism.

Simply put, Leal Vineyards is a top notch venue and knows how to put on a wedding! Our wedding in August of this year was beautiful, and all who attended said that it was "the best...

wedding they had ever attended." Our wedding coordinator, Erin "Tex" Bearman, is second to none. Throughout the year leading up to our wedding day, Erin handled all of our needs with the utmost professionalism and expertise. Erin and her team executed the event with precision and treated everyone like VIPs. If you want a perfectly choreographed, high class wedding that is fun and amazing, then Leal is the place to have one of the most important days of your lives. Picturesque setting (highly recommend the Barrel Room and the Estate homes), delicious food, awesome DJ and music, and overall perfection. Our outside vendors (Officiant, Hair and Makeup, and photographer) were all recommended to us by Leal and they were equally amazing, making our day that much more special. Leal covered all the basis and we highly recommend their event services. Thank you Leal! Xavier and Hannah Muñoz

y, at a venue that is picture-perfect literally around every corner, the entire process from start to finish was just as amazing as the wedding itself. From the very beginning, the Léal team made all parts of the wedding planning process absolutely seamless. Right when we set our date, they gave us a personal online profile that made it super easy to get all the details on our day whenever we needed it. They were also always readily available to answer any questions we had, and met with us when we wanted to fully visualize the locations we were using. As a Léal couple, a major perk to having your wedding at one of their venues is that you are able to work with their entire team, from the venue staff, planners, floral designers, catering team, bakery, and DJs... This venue is especially so unique because it has multiple different looks and experiences to choose from, not only for you as a bride and groom, but also for your guests... if you're considering Léal for your venue, you might as well stop your search now because nothing will compare!

Literally the worst company I have ever dealt with. Customer service and timely responses get a score of negative 5. I’m sad to say that we have wasted nearly a month trying to sec...

ure this venue for a wedding. After a bit of back and forth about the details we were told that with manager approval we were all set to book and promised a response within 2-3 days. We were assured that most if not all of what we had discussed would be approved. After a full 7 days we called for status only to be told that not only did she not have our approval, but she had lost the details entirely. We patiently reiterated what was previously discussed and were again assured that we would get a response within 2-3 days. Again, we got no response and another false promise of a call back that again didn’t happen. After 3 weeks wasted trying to secure this venue, we finally sent our ‘coordinator’ Mel a message letting her know that we needed to know one way or another and didn’t appreciate her lack of response. To this she quickly replied “ can you talk today” and provided a time she could fit us into her schedule that did not work for us. When we attempted to reach her again at a time that we could do, she completely blew us off with a “Good luck in your marriage and finding a venue”. We then reached out to Tiffany whom we were told was the manager in charge of all bookings. We sent an email requesting to speak with her directly and a brief description of the poor service we had gotten. After no response in several days, we called and were told Tiffany was on vacation and when she would return. So again we waited until 3 days after we were told she would be back at work and after no response, tried to call her. After 2 more days trying to reach her, we finally were able to speak to her. We quickly explained the situation and the lack of response we had received and asked to review the venue details directly with her. During the brief conversation in which she was very short with us and borderline rude, Tiffany did provide details and some possibilities but stated that she had a meeting and would need to get back to us by 2pm today. At close of business today we received a message from Tiffany telling us to take our business elsewhere. While I can only imagine what the 1st coordinator Mel said to cover her own behind for her horrible customer service, that was no excuse for the supposed ‘manager’ and lead person Tiffany to be so rude and unprofessional as well. A business is only as good as the people running it. Mr. Leal, I recommend that you reconsider the staff you have coordinating the events at your beautiful facilities.

nt to be staying on the property with family and friends, especially for our rehearsal dinner! Not only that, but the Leal staff constantly makes sure everything is running smoothly from the time you arrive to the morning after your wedding. The venue and staff will make this the best day of your life! Also, because Leal is so pretty, you can save money on your own decor since the venue is already gorgeous enough! We had our ceremony at the Lavanda site, and reception in the Barrel Room, which is the perfect room to keep your guests cool during the warmer months! Also, the "LOVE" sign photos are taken at their new gorgeous ceremony site!! There are SO many gorgeous spots for photos (Lavender field, olive trees, Barrel Room, love sign, vineyard, etc!)

You even get a day of coordinator. All services are customizable so it's up to you how much you want to spend but the rental fees are very reasonable. I also highly recommend renting the houses they have on site as they are perfect for the rehearsal dinner and getting ready the day of.

rt to finish the experience was exceptional! The staff and their vendors were responsive, organized and supportive of all of our needs. They truly were determined to make our wedding day perfect and special in every way. We took advantage of every thing Leal Vineyards had to offer, we rented the estate homes on the property which are breathtaking and our guests throughly enjoyed their stay at Hacienda de Leal. Renting the estate homes for the weekend allowed us to throughly enjoy our entire wedding weekend. Kendra Saenz, whom is the wedding coordinator was amazing, she made me feel at ease the entire time! Owie Popescu who is the General Manager was also super accommodating, he made sure that we got were able to make the most of our budget so that our wedding day would be everything we had dreamed about! Not to mention the fact that the two of them are so sweet and easy to talk too! Not only were we impressed by the venue and their staff but so were our guests! For weeks and now months after the wedding we've had our guests mention how impressed they were with the venue as well! Initially we were worried about the weather in June because we chose the Lavanda and tent for our ceremony and reception but we got really lucky, the high that day only got up to 80 degrees and it cooled down nicely in the evening. Mario Tavares who was the DJ recommended by Leal listened to our thoughts and ideas for music and ran with it! He did such a wonderful job of reading the crowd that by the end of the night our guests were begging him to stay for a couple hours longer! They couldn't get enough, which made us so happy because my biggest fear was that people wouldn't dance! Giselle Ribeiro whom is the florist also did a fabulous job! She took all of my Pinterest finds and make my vision come to life! Like I've mentioned several times in my review, we couldn't have been happier or more pleased with our experience! We would highly recommend this beautiful venue! #liveloveleal

es or are too small but this one can fit up to 300 people and had a very romantic atmosphere. The vineyards and ground are just beautiful! You also have the option to rent their estate homes for the weekend which I highly recommend! They are the perfect getting ready homes. There are 2 of them...the bride's house and the groom's house. Both have 4 bedrooms and have a shabby chique interior. You can also have your wedding rehearsal dinner there which has gorgeous views of the vineyards. Everything is included when you book with Leal...the florist, DJ, cake person, catering, etc. And the coordinators, Owie and Kendra, were a pleasure to work with! Everyone was! Giselle, the florist, made all the bouquets and centerpieces exactly how I wanted them. The whole wedding planning experience with them was so organized! Our DJ played all the songs we requested and our guests danced the night away. Our wedding cake from their pastry chef was beautiful and the food was absolutely delicious! This place was a lot cheaper but just as beautiful than any winery or vineyard in Napa. I want to get married here again!
