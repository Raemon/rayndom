We love this rustic arrangement of wildflowers, roses, branches and greenery suspended over the dance floor. The light-colored wooden dance floor complements the theme as well.

## Wedding Dance Floor Decal Ideas

If you don't need to establish a dance floor area with a vinyl wrap but would like a custom element, decorate it with a graphic decal. There are lots of ways you can go about it, so we've listed our favorites below. 

### 25\. "Peter Pan" Dance Floor Decal

![Custom dance floor decal with meaningful words](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/1a7fb10a-88d7-4bc5-88a6-17452a1450f2~rs_768.h-cr_0.10.600.810)

_[Photography: Laura Ivanova Photography](https://www.lauraivanova.com)_




Think about the possibilities. Choose some meaningful words, like this "Peter Pan" quote, and have a vinyl decal made to decorate your dance floor.

### 26\. Projection Wedding Dance Floor Lighting

![Projection lighting onto a wedding dance floor](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/9bd795ba-6f77-419e-86ce-ec8a8161a63d~rs_768.h-cr_81.0.1377.972)

Projection lighting doesn't have to be cheesy—especially if it's lighting projected on a wooden floor. Create a decorative pattern along with your names for an interesting effect.

### 27\. Gold Monogrammed Dance Floor

![Gold monogrammed dance floor. ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/ca4f4c75-a252-4e4f-91e4-4402a83d0fe1~rs_768.h-cr_110.0.1890.1335)

### 28\. Floral Dance Floor Wrap
