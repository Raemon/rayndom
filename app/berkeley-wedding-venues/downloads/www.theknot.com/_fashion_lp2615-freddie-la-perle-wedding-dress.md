Description

A boho dream brought to life, Freddie is the essence of a timeless romantic wedding dress. Her sheath silhouette hugs the body with elegant precision, crafted from layers of delicate floral lace that balance classic artistry with modern sensuality. Her strapless sweetheart neckline softly frames the shoulders and collarbone, while a semi-sheer bodice adds a subtle hint of allure. Complete with a matching veil (V2617C), Freddie is a vision of ethereal, bohemian beauty.
