## Mother-Son Dance Frequently Asked Questions

Beyond choosing the best mother-son wedding dance songs, there are a few other considerations that go into planning this special moment at the wedding, such as understanding the ideal timing for the dance. A few of our favorite wedding pros dish on all the FAQs about mother-son dance songs so you no longer have to wonder what to do.

### What is the mother-son dance?

The mother-son wedding dance is a chance for the mother of the groom and her son to share a special moment on the dance floor during the wedding reception. "The whole day, your mom has watched the young man that she raised grow up, and find that person that is their new #1," explains wedding photographer Vanessa Hicks of [Vanessa Hicks Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/vanessa-hicks-photography-honolulu-hi-1011211). "But, during the mother-son dance, she has a moment with her baby."

Beyond the mother of the groom and the groom, there may be other VIP mother-son relationships on display at the wedding. Whether that's a grandmother who's in attendance or even a son that the bride may have. If that's the case, talk with your [wedding planner](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/wedding-planners) about having an additional mother-son dance to honor that special relationship.

### When does the mother-son dance happen?

"For traditional receptions, the mother-son dance typically happens shortly after the couple share their first dance as newlyweds," says wedding planner Bisola Esiemokhai of [Event Design by BE](https://www.eventdesignbybe.com/). "For receptions that have a plated dinner, the mother-son dance can also take place in between courses or shortly after the cutting of the cake to help the flow of the program and keep guests engaged." Wedding expert Charlotte Ricard-Quesada of [La Fête](https://www.la-fete.com/) concurs, noting that "in many cases, it happens at the tail-end of the latter and therefore is wedged in between this and everyone joining the dance floor."

### How long should a mother-son dance be?

Weddings are not just formal occasions so you can have a lot of fun injecting your personality into the day; especially during the reception. The personalities of both the groom and the mother of the groom should be reflected in the song selected. Ultimately, traditions shouldn't apply here. For instance, if the groom or his mom share a carefree personality and they love to dance, a fast song interlaced with choreography may be more fitting.

Just like with [father-daughter dance songs](https://www.theknot.com/content/father-daugher-wedding-songs), the significance of the song (for either the groom or the mother) is equally as important. There may be a song that evokes very fond childhood memories, holds a special meaning that captures their relationship or be a tune they share a love for. Instead of picking a current or popular song, consider picking a song that ensures that the mother-son dance is a sentimental and memorable moment.

### What's Important When Selecting a Song?

Ricard-Quesada advises that to-be-weds "pick a song that means something to the both of you. Is it the song your mom used to always have in the car and you would sing it together? Is it her own first dance song? There is no right or wrong answer, it needs to feel right to you both and have that special meaning."
