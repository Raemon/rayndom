From start to finish, our experience with Noor has been mostly positive :) the team’s communication with us has been excellent-Robert their manager was very timely and patient with...

answering all of the small questions that popped up throughout the months leading up to the wedding. When it was time to formally hand us over to the events team, the transition was smooth and seamless. Judy and Steph are so so so great! They are both fun and easy to talk to. We had a minor hiccup the week before our wedding regarding our dog-we were initially told that she could be in the ballroom during the reception but then were informed that due to health code, she could no longer be there during the reception. We were able to work out a solution though (if you are planning on having your dog with you for the wedding, I highly recommend having a designated pup buddy either way, since you most likely won’t be able to do that yourself.) Our dog ended up chilling in her crate in the bridal suite during dinner (she was so tired from the day’s events that it ended up working out anyway.) Noor has vendor meals for your vendors and was able to accommodate our pup with her own special made meal as well! Their food was amazing too-friends and family members liked it a lot (you’d expect chicken to be dry, but theirs was really really good!) I also loved how accommodating they were towards our outside vendors. Overall, we had a very positive experience with this venue and cannot recommend it enough. There is a lot of value with the prices they charge, and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves on our wedding day which is ultimately what matters most :) it was a welcome bonus that the experience leading up to the wedding was overwhelmingly positive as well!

I recently inquired about hosting my wedding at NOOR and was initially excited based on the images and general reputation. However, my experience quickly turned disappointing. Ther...

e was a clear miscommunication from the beginning regarding what was included in their exclusive package. After receiving the official pricing and details, it became evident that many of the items I was led to believe were included actually came at additional costs, far exceeding the budget I had clearly communicated from the start. When I expressed confusion, the response I received was not only dismissive but also lacked the basic care and sensitivity you'd expect from a venue that claims to specialize in celebrating life’s most meaningful events. It became clear to me that the focus here is less about creating a memorable experience for clients and more about maximizing profit. Sadly, my experience aligned with several reviews I’ve read since, and I now understand why others have expressed similar concerns. There are plenty of other venues that genuinely care about your vision and experience. I highly suggest others take the time to explore those options before settling on NOOR.

le to reach out to them with questions, and I loved how they go over everything step-by-step from the contract to the nitty gritty details such as color of tablecloth. Stefany was a huge help in getting those details hammered out. The venue itself is so beautiful. Sophia's bar is glamorous, the bathrooms are pristine, and the hors d'oeuvres were so yummy! We had our ceremony, cocktail hour, and reception in the same location, and that was a huge bonus. Even our handicapped Grammy was able to maneuver through the venue with ease. Thank you so much to Noor for providing such a beautiful venue for our wedding. We love you guys, and we hope we can hold more events at your location!!

d in transforming a couple ideas into a fairy tale wedding every bride dreams of - we cannot adequately express our gratitude - we had such fun from the moment we met- through the menu testing - every dish was scrumptious and received many, many compliments from our guests - to the attention to even the smallest detail. No request was too small to be fulfilled - thank you Rachel for the blue ribbons ! The servers and the bartender / my apologies for not knowing their names - provide exemplary service with a smile. Thank you most kindly. My husband, Rob, and I are delighted to have such beautiful memories of our lovey wedding at NOOR. Thank you , Warmly, Mary Anne & Robert Vera Married May 4, 2024

ballroom and specially the outdoor terrace with 360 draping are really beautiful and classy event spaces. Robert, Aleen, Merissa, and their team was wonderful to work with - they made the whole planning process quite seamless and memorable. We had to revise our event plan quite a few times due to budget revisions and changes to guest count, and they were very accommodating and patient through it, kindly making suggestions that really elevated our event (ex. Strolling Champagne Dress, Liquid Nitrogen Ice-cream). Due to the scale of the event, we were given the Premium A/V Package for free! There were plenty of delicious food and drinks (Taste of the Mediterranean station, a variety of Hors D'Oeuvres, Vegetable Crudité & Cheese station, Specialty Dessert station including Macarons, Parisienne Crêpes, Chocolate Fountain, Gourmet Espresso, and other hot beverages etc.) to go around, with Prestige-level open bar and signature cocktails designed by the organizers! The event management staff, the bartending staff and the servers were great as well - on the day of, all items in the event agenda were executed smoothly and as envisioned, leaving no detail to worry about for us event organizers! They even had the staff wear cute berets to match our 'Night in Paris' theme! Their post-event service is great as well - we received the photos taken at the event (including LIVE Photobooth we purchased from them) on time, and they hired a professional videographer to capture all of the great moments from the event and edited them into a highlights video as a gift to us! ^_^ Thank you, Robert, Aleen and Merissa! Great Job!

I'm not sure where to start for this absolutely incredible experience. My husband and I had the wedding of our dreams at NOOR. When beginning to look around for venues, I had done ...

a quick Google search for places which accommodate small weddings in LA. NOOR was the first venue I chose to peruse. I decided to call, and the minute I spoke with Robert (who was very quick to respond), I knew we had found our location. To begin with, Robert is a kind, lovely man, who genuinely wants to make your event perfect. Being musicians who lost ALL work during the "shutdown", we were working with an embarrassingly small budget. Robert was very tactful and kind when explained our situation, and helped us find the perfect options for us. Honestly, absolutely everything provided exceeded our hopes and expectations. The entire process of planning was so easy - made seamless by Kaelan, our event manager (who is also hard-working and very sweet). Robert and Kaelan made every effort to accommodate us in every way to make it the most special day for us. They were always quick to respond, making communication simple. All aspects of the contract were clearly explained, and the timeline / due dates were easy to follow. We held our reception in the stunning, tastefully designed Art Deco foyer, as we only had around 50 people. The table settings were gorgeous, the drinks were perfect, and the plated meals and their presentation were outstanding. I love that NOOR's packages include the linens, plates, silverware, glassware, gratuities, and other fees - we didn't have to stress about a thing! Speaking of the packages offered, NOOR has amazing options for any budget! For our ceremony, we were supposed to be married on the pretty patio, but unfortunately, it rained that morning. Despite the last-minute change to hold the ceremony indoors (which was still beautiful), the day of our event went perfectly. During the reception, the staff were amazing and kind to everyone, and treated us, literally, like royalty. Our friends and family raved for weeks about how incredible everything was, saying it was the perfect mix of class and unpretentiousness. Even my 8 year old son could not believe the quality of everything and has declared he, too, will be married at NOOR! 😂 I cannot recommend this venue, and all of it's staff, enough. I wish we could host more events there! A million thanks to Robert and Kaelan for giving us an unbelievable day, and memories we will cherish for a lifetime.

Our special day was initially set for May 9, 2020, but as we all know, COVID had other plans. We were crushed and decided to postpone a few months to August, thinking that the pand...

emic would pass and we could still enjoy our special day soon. That obviously didn't happen either. Two more postponements and we finally were able to celebrate on April 23, 2022. During that time my wife and I decided to get married anyways, in a parking lot, at the Honda Center in Anaheim, CA. Not exactly the same environment as we had dreamed of at NOOR, but nevertheless a day we will never forget. Each time we had to postpone we inquired about terminating our contract, as the lure and excitement kept fading the longer the pandemic prevented us from holding our event. I get it - a contract is a contract and businesses were struggling too. Bridget was great, doing whatever she could to try and accommodate us and, for that, we were very appreciative. So here we are, almost 2 years after we got married - wife is now 6+ months pregnant, but we had an amazing time. Our event coordinator, Kaelan, was incredible! She was so sweet and made sure everything went according to plan. Our friends and family kept mentioning how calm and laid back we were throughout the entire day and evening, and a huge part of that goes to Kaelan and the team at NOOR for preparing and executing our timeline of events flawlessly. I'll be honest, there were many times we discussed and wished that we could have cancelled our event, moved on, and put this all behind us, but after experience our wedding day (i.e., almost 2 year vow renewal) at NOOR, we are truly happy to have held the event and now have the wonderful memories with our family and friends.

We recently had our wedding at NOOR and honestly can't thank the entire NOOR team enough for flawlessly executing our dream wedding! We could not have been more happy with how our...

wedding turned out, in spite of a little unexpected rain on the day-of! It was absolutely perfect!! Our on-site coordinator, Anna, did a superb job and handled everything with such calmness, grace, and professionalism! She was THE BEST throughout the entire planning process and executed our vision amazingly. She was always responsive everytime we called or emailed. Our wedding was originally booked for June 2020 but we had to postpone twice due to COVID. Robert and his team at NOOR were so accommodating and worked with us through both postponements so we never felt like we were going to lose out on our venue. That peace of mind was priceless! We went through 3 different on-site coordinators over 3 years and every single coordinator handled our wedding with the utmost care and professionalism to make for a seamless transitional process. Every time we went for our site meetings, we always got a little more excited for our wedding because the venue is gorgeous and always so welcoming. NOOR is truly the best! The food and service at the wedding was top-notch--all of our guests had the best time and have been raving about how beautiful of an event it was! We have been recommending NOOR to our friends and family, even before our wedding happened but now, we can attest to its greatness.

From the very beginning, NOOR has been nothing but top-notch. We first communicated with Bridget and was very happy with how detailed and transparent she was about pricing. We knew...

exactly what we were getting and we barely had any follow up questions. When we went to see Noor, we were blown away. The place was spotless, newly renovated, and stunning. We immediately knew this was the place to celebrate our reception. We booked the Sofia Ballroom the same day and are so happy we did! Emma was our event coordinator and we corresponded with her throughout the planning process. She always responded to our emails promptly and made the process so easy. We had last minute updates the week of the wedding and she never made us feel like we couldn’t approach her. Noor has this wedding thing down. The very detailed requests they had of our event details made me feel secure about how prepared they will be on the day. Everything was perfect on our wedding day! We got compliments on how beautiful the place was, how good the drinks were, and especially about how yummy the food was. We are so blessed we found Noor when we did. We have noting to complain about. We recommend Noor to anyone, especially brides who are planning their own wedding. Noor will make your planning easier. Thank you Bridget and Anna for everything! God bless and I hope you make many more couples happy with your service! ♥️

eternally grateful to Bridget Ann, Kaelan, and Lucy from Wife of the Party day-of coordinating - they are all amazing - super professional, informative, patient, immensely supportive and so sweet. They are all on top of their game. We could not have done it without them. We chose Noor not only because of the gorgeous ballroom, but also because Noor provides pretty much everything that you need, which makes the planning that much easier. You can make your event as simple or as grand as you'd like through every detail - and Noor covers every single thing. Noor's location is also very convenient for you and your guests, and not to mention beautiful. The FOOD is literally so delicious and your guests will not stop talking about how good the hors d'oeuvre and main courses are; the salmon and Mac & cheese canapés were amazing. Everything in the Ella Ballroom was immaculate. Vibes were great, drinks were flowing, and service was prompt and flexible with our timeline. We cannot thank Noor enough, and we cannot wait to have our next event here. THANK YOU!

If you have made it this far in your search for a venue, it would be futile to look any further. This is the most beautiful venue that I have ever seen, especially if you are looki...

ng for a fun and festive wedding vibe. The energy that this place gives off is what sets the mood for the reception (your guests will feel it) and the photographs/video will look so glamorous and luxurious, you'd think you were in a movie wedding. People: The staff at Noor are the BEST! From the very beginning, Bridget Ann was so helpful and accommodating to our needs and vision for the big day. Noor offers a ton of different packages and options to choose from, and she really helped us find the best one that would fit our needs AND budget. I also could not have asked for a more helpful, attentive and responsive coordinator (Kaelan), who always kept us on track and was ready to answer one of my million questions at any moment :) Place: The pictures speak for themselves. We were in the Ella ballroom, which had the goth-Victorian chandeliers with LED lights everywhere, giving it a modern touch. It's hard to explain but the end result is just so stunningly beautiful. Your guests will be looking from the ceiling to the floor. Food: Noor's food is DELICIOUS. This is not your typical wedding food (forgettable), this is restaurant quality food - if it wasn't a venue, you'd want to go eat here on a weekly basis. We had the middle eastern family style option, and our guests could not stop talking about the food. Accommodation/Options: Noor's packages cover a lot of what you'll need for your wedding. From a beautiful ballroom that needs no extra work to the food and entertainment options. It is all basically on a menu and you choose from what fits your budget. On top of that, what they do not directly offer, they give you a list of trusted partners that they've worked with in the past (from DJs to wedding planners/coordinators and beyond). This really takes a lot of stress out of the planning process, which can be daunting in the beginning when you don’t know where to start. I truly cannot recommend this place enough. There simply is no other venue like it.

time to look for a wedding venue in Pasadena, of course, the Noor was on the contender list. Trevor, my now husband, and I did a tour of the Sofia (larger ballroom) ballroom in November 2018 (1 month after getting engaged) and it looked perfect! It was renovated from the time I had my debut in 2012 and Trevor got that “feeling” when he saw it in-person. We originally booked it for our wedding reception on 10/17/2020. Trevor and I had a church ceremony. When COVID-19, the NOOR made it super easy to reschedule and postpone our wedding reception. We moved it to 10/09/2021 seamlessly. The Noor is your one-stop-shop of wedding venues. You have EVERYTHING you need plus gorgeous architecture. It was the wedding reception of my dreams. Thank you, Kaelan, Robert and all the Noor staff. I hope to work together again in the future!

We recommend reserving rooms at the Hyatt hotel (as it is easy walking distance to the venue). The liquid nitrogen ice cream add on was a big hit. We were looking for a small-to-medium wedding venue at a moderate price point with an attentive staff and Noor was a perfect fit.

I asked a lot of questions since I was planning the entire wedding myself, and they were so patient with me the entire time! We also received so many compliments on the food and hors d'oeuvres, the guests LOVED it!! The spread they put together was truly amazing. The ballroom looked absolutely spectacular as well!

I got married 9/28/19 at the NOOR and it was simply Fabulous. It takes me a while to write reviews but this place is absolutely worthy of it. Weddings are Stressful...venue shoppin...

g is Stressful. I’m a summer baby and I’ve Always dreamt of a Beach wedding, but my now husband sold me over why that’s not the Best idea...getting your dress filthy is just 1 reason. So, the Beach was out...my next destination I was obsessed w/, was golf-courses, but he wasn’t sold on that either...so I searched other locations...and that’s when I found the NOOR; I believe on The Knot app. We visited the NOOR and instantly fell in Love. The NOOR is unlike most places you visit. It doesn’t Need additional decorating like A lot of places...although you can. It’s literally a one-stop shop, Lighting, Food, Beverage, Dance-Floor, Vendor’s, etc; The NOOR definitely was Not the cheapest location, however you get what you pay for. If there was Anything that we were not OK with, the NOOR staff worked around the clock to fix Whatever the issue was. Our wedding ceremony was outdoors in the courtyard, and our reception was inside the larger of the two indoor spaces ...the beautiful, Sofia. LA’s forecast was clear skies All Summer long...all the way into Oct...sadly, the weekend I was to get married, had a 40% chance of Rain. I did NOT want to get married indoors...At All...Yet, due to the impending Rain, that just might be a realization. Long story short, Miranda (God-send) gives me the Best news a Bride can receive...Although, there was a Hard-Drizzle (LA Rain) earlier in the day...Our Wedding will go on as Planned (1 1/2 Years)...Outside!! To you it might Not mean much, but to Me, the Bride...it was Heaven. Simply to say...the Owner Robert, staff Maria (God-send), Miranda, and the rest of the NOOR’s staff were impeccable...Thank You. I am Blessed that my husband pushed me to pick something outside of my norm, where I was able to find the NOOR. I would not have wanted it to happen any other way. Our Wedding was simply Gorgeous, filled w/ Love, Great food, and Fun! From day 1, Maria made us feel So Welcome...like family...and we will Cherish All of the once in a Lifetime memories. There is Nowhere else we would have rather gotten married here in the states. They were Attentive and Responsive to Every single Need/Want that we had, and we will be Forever grateful that we chose the NOOR. Still to this day, people talk about how much they Loved our wedding. We even know people that Loved our wedding and the NOOR so much, that they have actually booked their events there; including our photographer @lunabellaphoto. If you are deciding between venues or want something different, I say go with the NOOR...it will be Extraordinary. 💜

I had less than 2 months to plan our wedding and I really have to commend Kenji, Bridgette Ann, and Miranda for their assistance in facilitating our wedding planning. Here is my re...

view of our experience with Noor. PRE PLANNING As soon as I inquired about Noor, I immediately received a response from Bridget Ann (Vice President of Sales) within hours. Although we received a prompt response from Bridget Ann, my wife and I were still exploring other venues. After speaking with other venues, we decided to proceed with Noor for the following reasons: Location - Centralized location for the majority of our guests. Ample parking space to accommodate guest’s vehicles. Aesthetics - The ballroom and foyer were well maintained and looked great. We had approximately 130 guests which the ballroom accommodated everyone comfortably and without appearing too vacant. The foyer isn’t meant to hold all the guests inside. They do have some lounge chairs and tables but again, not for 100+ guests. Plan accordingly to accommodate elderly guests and the disabled. Price - Their wedding packages start at $85/person which I thought was kind of pricey at the time. However, there were no hidden fees or any additional charges (service, tax, etc) which I liked. This helped us keep track of our budget. FINAL MEETING On our final meeting, I met with Kenji (Event Manager) and discussed the floor plan, wedding timeline, and other administrative matters. I really appreciate the fact that Kenji took the time to listen and accommodate my requests. I was provided a suggested floor plan layout to which I altered and presented it to Kenji. Kenji assured me that they can absolutely meet my request while professionally advising me of potential issues that I didn’t foresee with my layout. In the end, I went with their suggested layout. These guys are professionals with years of experience that know their venue. Clients are free to make adjustments to the floor plan but it seems to me that they will have the optimal solution once you provide the details and client specific guidelines. WEDDING DAY I was very pleased with the Noor Staff. Kenji was present and made sure everything was flowing smoothly and keeping up with the timeline that I provided. I did have some minor changes on the day of to which the staff was very flexible and more than accommodating. They understand that a couple’s wedding day is one of the most important life events anyone can experience which showed through their exceptional level of service. CONCLUSION I would highly recommend Noor and their team of experts to host your next event. Wedding planning can be very stressful but with the team’s outstanding organization skills, it will alleviate any unnecessary stress. They are a team of problem solvers who will always provide some sort of suggestion or solution. With that being said, the wedding planning responsibility does fall upon the couple. I appreciated the fact that they went the extra mile to provide feedback and pay close attention to detail. You can certainly have it your way (while adhering to the rules/regulations) but sometimes, they may already have the best way.

s defiantly a memorable experience. Noor was our 2nd venue to visit and after meeting with Robert and Miranda for the tour, we instantly knew we wanted Noor to be apart of our special day. We had the terrace for our ceremony and Sophia ballroom for the evening and it was all so magical. From the floor plan, to all the interior details, and the white curtains in the terrace surrounding the ceremony, our wedding was very intimate which was exactly what we wanted. Kenji was our main contact/ coordinator and he helped us so much, at times I felt I was being annoying with all the worrying and questions but each time he made me feel at ease. Kenji and the team was very communicative and always responded quickly. They were great and super flexible in meeting our budget but also giving the esthetic we wanted for the theme of the wedding and also what we wanted for our guests. They are dog friendly for the terrace ceremony area, which was one of our main reasons in choosing Noor. The bridal suite was a nice relaxing area upstairs in the apartments where we were able to look down at the terrace while things were being set up. That was a nice view that we got to experience. I was starting to loose my voice an hour before the ceremony, good thing there was a full kitchen in our bridal suite and there was even an assortment of teas that we helped our selves too. Wedding food at venues can be a little scary sometimes, cause you just don't know until you've booked them, also as a guest we've attended other venues and the food has always been mehhhh and always went home hungry. Noor has such a great list of options it was so hard to choose from cause everything looked so yummy! So happy that we ended up choosing a deluxe menu option, all our guests complimented on how yummy the food was and they all left very full. Our guests had so much fun during the dancing portion too, fyi the lighting package is a must! It made such a difference in the mood from cocktail, dinner, games, into dancing the night away! It was also so nice to see how our photos progressed through the evening with the light changes in the background. We love Noor and wouldn't have changed anything about our wedding except we wish we could have partied longer. It was truly magical and Thank You team Noor for giving us such a great memorable experience!

lable on the one Saturday we were looking at!). We were definitely on a time crunch, but Maria & Miranda were an absolute DREAM to work with. They were professional, kind, humorous, patient, & maybe most important of all, RESPONSIVE. The Ella ballroom is modern & stunning, it fit our wedding of ~110 well though it would probably feel too crowded if there were any more people. The food was delicious in comparison to other weddings I've been to, & this is because their kitchen doesn't leave hot food sitting out; it's served as they are made. The price for our wedding package was more affordable than we initially guessed! The only thing we didn't get to experience was their bridal suite because there's only one but 2 ballrooms, but this didn't pose a major issue due to the abundance of hotels within walking distance. Overall, we loved NOOR, their staff, & wish we could do it all over again. <3 P.S. The bartenders (especially the award-winning female, sorry I forgot her name) are awesome.
