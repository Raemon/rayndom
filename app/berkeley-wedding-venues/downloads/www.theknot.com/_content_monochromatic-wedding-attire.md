It's a burgeoning wedding trend, it's a stunning detail in photos and it's one of the most controversial Reddit wedding topics, which is why you should be extra mindful and clear when it comes to how to ask wedding guests to wear a certain color. Whether you're after a full-monochrome look or a family of coordinating colors, this guest request takes some thought and care, since it comes as a secondary ask to your baseline dress code. For example, an attendee might have a dress in the juicy red hue you're requesting, but it could be cocktail length and you're requesting a black-tie formality level.

Think through scenarios like this as you consider asking your wedding guests to wear certain colors, and also if your friends and fam' are the type of folks that would be pumped to be a part of the scheme of hues you chose after all that careful research you did into potential [wedding color palettes](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-color-inspiration-boards). And when you're ready, we're diving into the how, the where and the right etiquette to ensure this ask goes over well.

## Can You Ask Wedding Guests to Wear a Certain Color?

Yes, you can ask wedding guests to wear a certain color to your nuptials. However, it's important to note that, while you can make the request (or suggestion), there's a chance that not all guests will be able to abide by your stipulations perfectly. Flexibility and grace is key here, since the most important factor is that your loved ones are here to celebrate you.

That said, a cohesive color palette for your attendees can sometimes make them feel more connected and part of the greater atmosphere. "It creates a beautiful monochromatic look for photos," says wedding fashion expert [Nayri Kalayjian](https://weddingfashionexpert.com/). "Some guests may not like it and have opinions, but stay true to your vision and don't let other people's opinions impact your vision."

## How to Ask Wedding Guests to Wear a Certain Color

It takes some tact to hit the right tone when it comes to asking wedding guests to wear a certain color. Check out the examples for [how to word your wedding dress code](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-website-dress-code) below to get the message across in a way that'll resonate with your nearest and dearest. 

### Find your kind of venue

From barns to ballrooms, discover reception venues that feel like you.

### Kind & Warm

You can never go wrong with a kind and warm approach when it comes to relaying any wedding info to your guests. Use these examples to guide you. 

  * We'd love it if you could wear your favorite shade of blue to the celebration so our guests can serve as our "something blue." 
  * To nod to the gorgeous fall foliage in our wedding location, please wear your favorite autumn color to the event.
  * Please indulge us by donning your favorite jewel tone, if you don't mind.



### Funny & Cheeky

If your wedding is more casual, feel free to lean into some silly language here. It might help lighten the mood of this request too. 

  * If you have something that falls into the "sunset colors" family, please wear it to the event. (I know, we're being very extra here.) 
  * Wouldn't it be fun if you all wore black? (Please do if you have an outfit that works—we have a VISION.) 
  * We'd love it if all guests wore earth tones to the wedding. (Because we think you're all the best people in the world!)



### Firm & Elegant

Throwing a formal affair? This is the wording section for you. These examples are clear and get your point across while still sounding sophisticated. 

  * We kindly request that guests wear attire in dark colors to the celebration. 
  * In honor of our soon-to-be-shared surname, Green, we kindly ask that each guest wear their favorite shade of the color to celebrate this new chapter. 
  * Attire in pastel shades is strongly encouraged. 



### Optional & Suggested

So you'd love it if all of your guests were on board with the color dress code, but you don't want to force anything. Use the wording samples here to ensure your loved ones don't feel pressured to go buy something new if your desired color isn't in their closet.

  * Though by no means required, we'd appreciate it if guests wore one of the seven colors of the rainbow.
  * Please don't go out and buy anything new, but if you have formalwear in a shade of pink or green, we'd love it if you wore it. 
  * Kindly wear a summer color of your choice to the celebration, whatever makes you excited for the season!



## Where to Communicate Color Dress Code Information

The best place to communicate color dress code information to guests is the one that they'll refer back to repeatedly ahead of the celebration: your [wedding website](https://www.theknot.com/gs/wedding-websites). Add this information under any [wedding website FAQ questions](https://www.theknot.com/gs/wedding-websites) surrounding your dress code and event's level of formality. Or, if you want this detail to be more front and center, you can separate it into its own question: Q: "Are there any specific attire requests we, as guests, should be aware of?" "Yes, we'd love it if all attendees could wear red or green, if they have it, to help bring some Christmas spirit into our winter wedding."

If you feel like some folks might not reference your wedding website's FAQ page, you could also include overall dress code information in your invitation suite. Do note: This does not mean add this info to your _actual_ wedding invite. Rather, slide a small dress code [details card](https://www.theknot.com/paper/enclosure-cards) into the envelope along with the invitation, RSVP card and other enclosures. 

## Tips on Asking Wedding Guests to Wear Certain Colors

You've gone through the process of [how to choose your wedding color palette](https://www.theknot.com/content/weddings-with-color) and have made the decision to ask your guests to partake in the vibrant fun. Use the tips below to guide your color choice and help attendees get on board. 

### Stick to Common Colors or Color Families

Don't get too wrapped up in [color trends](https://www.theknot.com/content/weddings-with-color). "Picking a difficult color like periwinkle, for example, can be challenging because, if manufacturers are not creating attire in that color in the seasons leading up to the wedding, it can make it extremely difficult for guests," says Kalayjian. "Try to keep the color(s) in line with something easy for guests to shop for, like black, metallics, brown, earthtones, shades of green, red, etc." Another thing to consider: Aim to choose colors or color families that guests are likely to have in their closets already, so they won't feel pressured to buy something new for the occasion. 

### Make a Mood Board

"A mood board is a great way to inspire guests," says Kalayjian. "I personally really appreciate a mood board when I'm preparing for an event. It gives me a visual of how formal or informal I should dress." You can easily assemble a mood board on Pinterest or another platform that includes some inspo color tones. Link to it on your wedding website below your color dress code info. 

### Don't Stress Too Much

"You may have guests not follow the dress code and show up in whatever they feel comfortable in—don't let it spoil your mood or bother you on your wedding day," says Kalayjian. "This is your day and it's all about celebrating love and enjoying every single moment." Plus, we know you adore the friends and family members that'll be attending this event and that your top priority is to ensure they feel comfy and happy. So truly, don't sweat it if a few folks aren't down with your color dress code.
