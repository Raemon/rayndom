## 1\. Unique and Interactive Activities 

![Unique and interactive activities 2026 bridal shower trend](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/c75e93c5-0058-4ed5-a4b8-8943d94bea1c~rs_768.h)

Activity-themed parties are one of the latest wedding shower trends that will continue to take over the wedding world in 2026. The idea behind this trend is to incorporate a fun activity or something that the attendees might not normally do at a party, like a[ flower bar bridal shower](https://www.theknot.com/content/flower-bar-bridal-shower). Want another idea? Emily Reno, the owner of [The Vegas Planners](https://thevegasplanners.com/) with more than a decade of planning experience, suggests having a jewelry-making station at your party. "Whether it's [permanent jewelry](https://www.theknot.com/content/permanent-jewelry-party) or having guests create their own bracelet with beads, this activity is interactive, creative and gives guests something meaningful to take home. Letting guests create or make something at the shower feels more meaningful than handing out a packaged favor," she says.

Briana Johnson, a multicultural wedding planner and the founder of [Planned and Polished Events](https://www.plannedandpolished.com/), says she also sees shower hosts focusing more on creating experiences rather than sticking to the traditional games. "Instead of everyone gathering in a living room with finger sandwiches, more couples are hosting paint-and-sip nights or mixology classes that feel like an extension of their personality," she says. You can also make your food and drink stations interactive and connect with your theme. For example, if you're planning an [Italian-themed bridal shower](https://www.theknot.com/content/italian-themed-bridal-shower), have a build-your-own pasta and Aperol spritz bar. 

## 2\. Personalized Shower Themes

![Personalized shower themes 2026 bridal shower trend](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/ee7f00d2-c089-46dc-b1a7-446d4b9e8de8~rs_768.h)

The most popular [2026 wedding trends](https://www.theknot.com/content/new-wedding-trends) will always be ones that focus on being highly personalized. "Showers are a great opportunity to dive deep into a [bridal shower theme](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-shower-themes) and showcase the couple's likes and hobbies. Bringing your guests on a journey about your relationship will only help enhance the wedding day experience," Loni Peterson, owner of [LP Creative Events](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/lp-creative-events-denver-co-2022537) and former event producer for Coachella and the Super Bowl, says. [Keri Calabrese](https://www.kericalabresephotography.com/), a professional photographer who founded [Keri Calabrese Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/keri-calabrese-photography-bridgewater-nj-1051149) in 2016, agrees with Peterson and says that showers are now geared toward a specific theme. "I think there are so many bridal-focused events these days that it's fun to have a theme party that's more niche. For example, I've seen a queen-of-hearts-inspired shower with lots of red and a bit of a darker vibe," she says. 

Carmen Hinebaugh, an attorney and the owner and lead planner of [Evermore Occasions](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/evermore-occasions-herndon-va-2070397), tells us what you'll expect to see at these personalized 2026 showers. "Showers take on design-driven themes, as we saw with welcome parties this year—less about traditional games and balloon arches, more about curated palettes, tailored menus and thoughtful details that may nod to the couple's wedding day design," she says. So if you're responsible for hosting the celebration, ask the guest(s) of honor what aspects of their relationship, themselves or their wedding they want highlighted at the celebration. Consider having a menu inspired by the couple's first date or offering favors that represent the to-be-wed's love of reality TV.

## 3\. Lots of Bow Details

![Bow details 2026 bridal shower trend](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/1039d893-0527-4b49-8a10-4ac22f038e79~rs_768.h)

_[Photos: Chris J. Evans Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/chris-j-evans-photography-maui-hi-764729),__[Terra Ong Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/terra-ong-photography-salt-lake-county-ut-2005190),__[Jes Workman](https://www.jesworkman.com/),__[Carlie Statsky](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/carlie-statsky-santa-cruz-ca-301035),__Design: Natalie Romine_

"Bows are another detail that's everywhere in decor right now, and I think we'll continue to see them woven into wedding showers through 2026," says Reno. It's true–bows are one of those trending bridal shower ideas that'll continue to be big next year. From flowers to cakes, you can expect to see bows at just about every wedding-related event. "We're not just going to see [bows on hair accessories](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-bows), shoes, bags and clothes, but used as decor, too. There'll be bows wrapped around food, drink glasses, on tables and even hanging in trees. If you want an ultra-sweet, romantic shower, incorporate this trend into your event," says Grace Lee Chen, co-founder and CEO of Birdy Grey.

## 4\. Showers That Involve Everyone

"Coed showers are here to stay. Couples love being able to celebrate together with their full circle of friends and family," says Hinebaugh. Peterson even tells us that saying "wedding shower" (instead of "bridal shower) is becoming more popular since both partners are involved and want to plan together. Keith Willard, an event planner with over nine years of experience and the owner of [Keith Willard Events](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/keith-willard-events-fort-lauderdale-fl-1041879), adds, "I think bridal showers are going to become more gender-neutral. More and more weddings are having a ['man of honor'](https://www.theknot.com/content/male-maid-of-honor) and 'best woman' in their wedding parties, so it's no surprise that the shower invitees would also follow suit."

[Couple's Shower Ideas](https://www.theknot.com/content/coed-couple-bridal-shower-themes)

## 5\. Combined Shower and Bach Parties 

Craig Peterman, a professional photographer and videographer and the owner of[ Craig Peterman Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/peterman-photography-and-video-tucson-az-2055844), says the previous wedding shower trend will extend to other prewedding celebrations. "Couples' showers will blur into [joint bachelor and bachelorette parties](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-to-have-coed-bachelor-bachelorette-party), built as a single day or a full weekend," he says. Wondering what this type of affair will look like? Peterman has the answer for you. "Expect destination house or villa takeovers with a pool party, dinner pregame and a late set with a DJ. Coed guest lists and experience-first planning will be present, but with louder nightlife elements, like karaoke battles, silent disco and drinking games," he continues. Bonus: By combining the shower and the bach, you probably save guests' money on travel and take up fewer days on their calendars.

## 6\. Themed Shower Baskets 

![Themed bridal shower baskets 2026 trend](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/5185ad3f-4a06-45f1-8549-27893bef1e03~rs_768.h-cr_0.111.1076.1546)

_[Photo: Keri Calabrese Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/keri-calabrese-photography-bridgewater-nj-1051149)_

Themed wedding shower baskets aren't a new shower trend, but it is coming back in style. "I think guests like to give baskets because it's a nice way to surprise the to-be-wed with a collection of gifts that they likely don't already have and that can be used for a specific purpose," says Calabrese. She says she's seen numerous themes for this shower idea, such as baskets for honeymoon, kitchen or bathroom essentials. 

The guest(s) of honor can also join in on the fun by making baskets for their party attendees. "The guests are given tickets and they choose the baskets they want to win by putting their tickets in a bag near the basket. Near the end of the shower, the bride or couple pulls a ticket and that person gets to take home the basket. I've seen baskets full of lottery tickets, soaps, candles and much more," explains Calabrese.

## 7\. No Long Gift-Opening Periods

Even though gift baskets are making a reappearance at showers, it doesn't mean the party itinerary needs to have an hour blocked off to focus on gift-opening. "Experiences are very important to this new generation getting married. We're seeing that a lot more in the wedding weekend itself and it's trickling down to all of the fun wedding parties throughout the engagement period. Wedding shower gifts are less relevant as many couples are already living together and have many of the necessary items that used to be gifted," says Calabrese. But remember, this doesn't mean guests can't bring gifts. We're just noticing that gift-opening isn't an important part of the [bridal shower planning](https://www.theknot.com/content/a-bridal-shower-planning-checklist) anymore. 

Hinebaugh likes how couples are starting to view prewedding gifts. "I'd love to see more showers lean into presence over presents, with no-obligation gifting or group contributions to a honeymoon or new house. Wedding showers feel more optional these days, which makes it all the more important to host with intention, if you choose to have one. When you're inviting friends and family to travel and give another gift, it shouldn't be taken lightly. Thoughtful hospitality goes a long way," she says.

## 8\. Bold Colors and Decor

![Bright bridal shower color scheme trend](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/38493afb-5b21-4cff-80f9-50e2b4d25108~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.818.1091)

Couples will continue to create a fun, energy-filled environment for their family members and friends in 2026. One of the ways to-be-weds will accomplish this task is by going all out with their decor. Choose the wedding shower color palette by thinking about what the guest of honor loves or picking hues that reflect the current season. Hosting the party on a summer afternoon? Go with a citrus-inspired color palette of orange, lime green and yellow and decorate with fresh fruits. If the to-be-wed loves the '90s, choose a nostalgic color palette of fuchsia and turquoise. "I love when the shower decor is thoughtful but not overdone—things like statement florals, bold color palettes or even a single artful detail that ties the whole space together. 2026 decor will feel elevated without being fussy, which is exactly what couples are craving," says Johnson.

## 9\. Digital Shower Invitations

"I think digital shower invitations are going to become much more popular. Many Gen Z couples aren't as interested in mailing paper invitations. They're tech savvy and focused on sustainability, and going digital makes it easier to [manage guest lists and RSVPs](https://www.theknot.com/gs/guest-list?vers=0)," says Reno. Even if you're not a part of the Gen Z crew, digital invitations are a good option for those who need a [bridal shower idea on a budget](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-shower-ideas-on-a-budget). You'll be able to save money on printing, stamps and envelopes.

(**_Psst:_** There's nothing wrong with going the conventional route for your paper products. Head over to [The Knot Invitations](https://www.theknot.com/paper/invitations/bridal-shower) where you can find recycled paper options and easy-to-customize shower invitations that are affordable.)

## 10\. Wellness-Focused Showers

Did you notice that [wellness wedding retreats](https://www.theknot.com/content/wellness-wedding) were on the raise last year? If not, it's okay because making one's wellbeing a priority will continue to be top of mind in 2026. "We're going to see more wellness-inspired showers. Instead of heavy alcohol, I'm seeing mocktails, juice bars, affirmation cards, sound baths and healthier menus. Overall, it will make the whole day feel more intentional and relaxing," says Reno. If your budget allows, we suggest finding a [bridal shower venue](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-shower-venues) that fits the mindful mood, like a spa resort, secluded park or private beach. 

Now that we've gone through all the predictions, you might be wondering what thread connects a lot of the trends. We think Johnson explains it best. "2026 showers will lean into being more intentional and inclusive. People are moving away from cookie-cutter traditions and asking, 'What will feel meaningful for us and our guests?' That shift makes showers more memorable and less about obligation. In the end, the best showers will reflect the couple's personalities and create an atmosphere where everyone feels connected."
