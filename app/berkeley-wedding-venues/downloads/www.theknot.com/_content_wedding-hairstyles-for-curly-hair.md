## 35 Wedding Hairstyles for Curly Hair

You should never feel limited by curly hair—you can do almost any [wedding hairstyle](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-hairstyles-you-will-love) with natural curls. Leaving your hair down can be a great way to show off the texture, while putting it up can help keep it out of your face and calm any anxiety about potential frizz. Of course, you can always opt for a half-up hairstyle to get the best of both worlds. Keep your [hair type](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-hair-type-tips) in mind when selecting a hairstyle, and remember to opt for something that makes you feel comfortable. 

### 1\. Simple and Down Curly Hairstyle 

![Simple and Down Curly Hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/193a6144-0c91-46c4-842e-469227391a20~rs_768.h-cr_0.160.1094.1619)

When you have gorgeous natural curls, you don't need to do much to make them shine. You can choose to leave your hair down and opt for a middle part for a more modern feel—no [bridal hair accessories](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-hair-accessories) needed. Just be sure your curls are looking and feeling healthy and hydrated for plenty of shine. 

### 2\. Soft Brushed-Out Updo 

![Soft Brushed-Out Updo](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/591be349-e474-4ccf-aaa9-6f3aea683255~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1094.1459)

_[Photographer: Gabriel Conover Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/gabriel-conover-photography-spring-valley-ca-1039469)_

If you love the look of fluffy, voluminous curls, then have your stylist brush yours out a bit to achieve that. You can add some interesting detail with an intricate hair accessory, like a large sparkling clip. Small braids or twists on one side also give this a really cool overall look.

### 3\. Half-Up Half-Down Curly Hairstyle 

![Half-Up Half-Down Curly Hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/fb5e7fbf-a7a2-4ad7-b31f-568abfd41bd4~rs_768.h-cr_0.6.1094.1465)

_[Photographer: Ruét Photo](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/ruet-photo-georgetown-tx-768995)_

A [half-up hairstyle](https://www.theknot.com/content/half-up-hairstyles-for-long-hair) is fairly low-maintenance, looks good on any hair type and length, and is versatile enough to work with most dresses. You also get to keep your hair off your face, but still down if you prefer that look. Keep things simple, like this curly hair wedding do, or add a hair accessory. 

### 4\. Fun Headpiece 

![Fun Headpiece](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/1158b37f-1d0f-4589-a0d6-b29020bb93c7~rs_768.h-cr_79.0.1040.721)

_[Photographer: Stephanie Rogers Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/stephanie-rogers-photography-austin-tx-824529)_

It can be difficult to do a [wedding updo](https://www.theknot.com/content/updos-for-long-hair) with shorter curly hair, so your best bet may be to work with what you have and just embrace the length. You can brush out your curls a bit for a more voluminous look, and keep things interesting with an elaborate headpiece, like a floral headband or flower crown. 

### 5\. Romantic Updo

![Romantic Updo](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/346ddb4e-ae92-48bf-9dd6-dec142536763~rs_768.h-cr_0.89.1080.1529)

_[Photographer: The Heims](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/the-heims-atlanta-ga-978670)_

One pretty and unexpected updo for naturally curly wedding hair is this one, which resembles a pineapple updo. It looks great with tighter curls and some volume, and is very elegant and pretty. This is also great for high necklines, since it gets all the hair off your shoulders. 

### 6\. High Bun 

![High Bun](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/6905d7ee-55d0-498f-8222-80c51b1788fa~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1080.1440)

_[Photographer: Emily Wren Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/emily-wren-photography-philadelphia-pa-595214),__Hair: True Beauty Marks_

Whether your hair is curly or in braids, a high bun is always a classic option. This look means you don't have to worry about your hair getting sweaty all night, it looks polished and sophisticated, and it can be pulled back tighter or left a little on the tousled side. 

### 7\. Slicked-Back Ponytail 

![Slicked-Back Ponytail](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/72a318c2-c4da-401d-bc6a-5c2832aee973~rs_768.h-cr_80.0.1052.729)

_[Photographer: Emma Cleary Photo & Video](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/emma-cleary-photo-and-video-new-york-ny-420007),__Hair: Hair On Purpose_

Show off your natural curls and get a more polished look with this sleek ponytail. Tightly slick back the hair, but leave the ponytail full of volume and texture. A middle part makes this curly wedding hair feel a bit more in line with the [latest bridal hair](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-hair-trends). 

### 8\. Boho Floral Accents 

![Boho Floral Accents](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/3d7c3976-5440-4612-9ec4-d33a4ea18d68~rs_768.h-cr_61.0.1033.729)

_Photographer: C &W Productions Photography and Film by Marie Canieso_

Going for a more bohemian vibe? Adding flowers to your bridal hairstyle for curly hair is always a good move. A flower crown that complements the flowers in your bouquet is so pretty, and while it's a little over the top, it's perfect for a bride on her wedding day. 

### 9\. Half-Back Curly Hairstyle 

![Half-Back Curly Hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/13986507-af03-4b3b-8f75-7f15a0e9ea89~rs_768.h-cr_0.91.1094.1550)

_Photographer: Angel Patricia Photo_

Keep your hair down but out of your face with this half-back hairstyle. Grab some pieces of hair from the front of your head and twist them back into a subtle half-up style. Clips on either side add a little bit of sparkle. 

### 10\. Updo With Tendrils 

![Updo With Tendrils](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/1331f7f6-44c9-4aea-b361-ed688a5eb0f4~rs_768.h-cr_0.91.1094.1550)

_[Photographer: Zha Zha Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/zha-zha-photography-sunnyvale-ca-993433)_

"My favorite updos have a couple of curly face-framing tendrils at the hairline with enhanced curl definition and root lift while being pulled into a high or low bun," says Lorens Portalatin, international curly bridal stylist at [Dallas Curl Studio](https://www.dallascurlstudio.com/). This curly hairstyle for a wedding looks great with a side or middle part, and you can add an accessory if you'd like. 

### 11\. Flower Crown 

![Flower Crown](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/4df2a9a5-d19c-4de9-8e8a-e24238b74720~rs_768.h-cr_61.0.1033.729)

_Photographer: Lizzie Randazzo Photography,__[Hair: Amy Merritt Hair & Makeup](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/amy-merritt-hair-and-makeup-louisville-co-2001043)_

Defined, springy curls look great no matter how you style them, and while they don't really need anything extra, a fun accessory is hard to turn down. This pretty flower crown gives a more boho and casual vibe, and looks great with a low bun or a short hairstyle. 

### 12\. Side-Swept Updo 

![Side-Swept Updo](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/501865fc-c803-4292-af98-ceb16d3d784e~rs_768.h-cr_0.180.1094.1639)

_[Photographer: Chettara T. Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/chettara-t-photography-detroit-mi-1061398)_

Opt for full Hollywood glamour with a romantic side-swept updo like this one. A deep side part is what differentiates it from other updos, and you can leave some tendrils of hair out around the face. 

### Find your kind of venue

From barns to ballrooms, discover reception venues that feel like you.

### 13\. Shiny and Polished

![Shiny and Polished](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/28e352b7-28f9-442d-b87d-7a6533b2d438~rs_768.h-cr_0.90.1080.1530)

_[Photographer: Hannah Greenwood](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/hannah-greenwood-palm-springs-ca-997425)_

A perfect [wedding hairstyle for long hair](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-hairstyles-long-hair) can be this simple: Make sure your curls are defined, polished and shiny, then leave them to fall down your back. This is an easy look, but to make it work, ensure it's not going to be too humid or rainy. 

### 14\. Tousled Updo

![Tousled Updo](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/cd7d3beb-5ba7-46c4-8213-974e79d5dfc5~rs_768.h-cr_0.14.1094.1473)

_[Photographer: Jen Huang Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/jen-huang-photography-new-york-ny-204000)_

You can still show off the texture of your naturally curly hair even in an updo. To do so, don't pull your hair back super tight—instead, leave it just a little loose and tousled. Pull it into a high, slightly messy bun for a romantic look. 

### 15\. Loose and Laid Back

![Loose and Laid Back](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/c93ab759-a073-4230-af2f-78dbb8b49909~rs_768.h-cr_0.2.1094.1461)

_[Photographer: Carlie Statsky](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/carlie-statsky-santa-cruz-ca-301035)_

For a more casual vibe, you can leave your curls loose and flowy, falling over your shoulders and slightly mussed up. This wedding hairstyle for naturally curly hair can become a bit undone by the end of the day, but if you're okay with that, it can also be lovely in person and in photos. Add a small flower crown or hair accessory for some detail. 

### 16\. Short and Simple

![Short and Simple](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/6749e80c-29b0-43f2-ac4a-e314f69fef5c~rs_768.h-cr_0.91.1094.1550)

_[Photographer: Anna Jung-Hwa Photography](https://www.annajunghwa.com/about)_

This is the perfect example of a [short wedding hairstyle](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-hairstyles-short-hair) that requires very little day-of effort. The key to making this look great is to take care of your hair in the weeks leading up to the wedding day—make sure it's hydrated and healthy, then use product to keep it defined and frizz-free. 

### 17\. Soft Curls and Low Ponytail 

![Soft Curls and Low Ponytail](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/3d5f3255-fdc7-4572-a0d4-090bcee97e39~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1094.1458)

_[Photographer: Nikki Daskalakis](https://nikkidaskalakis.com/),__Hair: Glamour by Troi_

Opt for soft, glamorous S-curls if you're going for drama. An unexpected way to do this classic look is to pull back the hair into a slicked-back low ponytail, then leave the curls as voluminous as possible. A sparkling headband completes this wedding hair for curly hair. 

### 18\. Half-Braid Crown With Loose Curls 

![Half-Braid Crown With Loose Curls](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/094ac7fb-891d-4e79-9c26-e0bbe2bea2f3~rs_768.h-cr_122.0.1094.729)

_[Photographer: The Messenger Image](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/the-messenger-image-pasadena-md-592034)_

Loose curls are so pretty and give off a slightly more casual vibe, especially when paired with a braid crown. This braid crown offers a boho half-up look and isn't overwhelming or too large. The addition of tiny baby's breath throughout the braid is such a nice touch. 

### 19\. Super-Short Curls 

![Super-Short Curls](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/9152eb9b-2fc4-4aa5-afb6-2935ab9cc473~rs_768.h-cr_0.91.1094.1550)

_[Photographer: Adam and Becca](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/adam-and-becca-indianapolis-in-2075223),__[Hair: ProSoto Salon](https://www.prosotobeautystudios.com/)_

Skip the extensions and embrace a pixie cut by defining your curls as much as possible. Piling them up on top of your head gives a cool and more modern look and feels special for your wedding day. 

### 20\. Voluminous Ponytail 

![Voluminous Ponytail](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/ccd2dd7b-15d2-4dab-aa3a-50fe502bd7d4~rs_768.h-cr_0.91.1094.1550)

A ponytail might be the best way to show off your curls while also having your hair pulled back. It looks great when the curls are perfectly defined and even after they get a little tousled by the end of the night. Slick back hair tightly to eliminate frizz and add a large hair accessory for drama. 

### 21\. Side-Swept With Clip

![Side-Swept With Clip](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/f4450561-3a7b-45dc-90b3-9b4f231aa52a~rs_768.h-cr_34.0.1059.1367)

_[Photographer: Merrick Cousley Photography](https://www.merrickcousley.com/),__[Hair: Simply Beautiful Jamaica](https://www.instagram.com/simplybeautifuljamaica/)_

A deep side part adds a bit of volume at the crown and creates a glamorous look. You really need some big, shiny curls for this one, and adding a clip at the part is such a pretty addition. 

### 22\. Casual Loose Curls

![Casual Loose Curls](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/5ffdac97-5f13-4d67-937c-4e5d4cbfb4fe~rs_768.h-cr_0.90.1080.1530)

_Photographer: Cory Weber Photographer_

Create a romantic style by gently brushing out your curls for a tousled, wavy look. You can pull back some pieces, leave face-framing tendrils, and add a headband or flower hair accessory in the back. 

### 23\. Beachy Texture

![Beachy Texture](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/e90c8d74-de98-455d-a071-778c310c390e~rs_768.h-cr_0.91.1094.1550)

_[Photographer: Daniela Ortiz Photography](https://www.danielaortizphoto.com/),__[Hair: Blanc Bridal Salon](https://blancbridalsalon.com/)_

If you're getting married on a beach and your hair tends to be a little less voluminous and more on the wavy side, embrace that by opting for a more beachy texture. Loose waves and a half-up style are perfect for a summer wedding by the seaside. 

### 24\. Simple Hair Clip 

![Simple Hair Clip](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/308ca2c7-eabe-4995-aeb1-5e00c7affe0a~rs_768.h-cr_0.19.1094.1478)

Leaving your hair down to shine is such a great way to show off your natural curls. This looks especially pretty with [medium-length hair](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-hairstyles-medium-hair) since it doesn't feel overwhelming. Add a flower clip to one side to make it feel a little more special. 

### 25\. Low Bun 

![Low Bun](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/da3458f0-4fb8-4cee-a541-7f34d9f80479~rs_768.h-cr_4.0.1094.1453)

Curly hair adds a more interesting texture to a low bun, making it feel romantic and soft. Pull hair back gently so it's not slicked back or too tight, and leave some face-framing tendrils out to make it feel more formal. 

### 26\. Low Updo With Middle Part 

![Low Updo With Middle Part](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/e1ccd17c-4ff1-48bc-8980-19df034dab59~rs_768.h-cr_0.8.1094.1467)

_[Photographer: Ruét Photo](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/ruet-photo-georgetown-tx-768995),__[Hair: Hannah Zahner Beauty](https://www.hannahzahner.com/)_

A sleek middle part makes even the most classic updos feel a little more modern and trendy. A low bun is a pretty and simple way to show off your natural texture. This curly updo hairstyle feels traditional and can work with almost any dress style.

If you'd prefer to keep your curls under wraps, then opt for a tighter updo. This keeps your curls more hidden, but your natural texture will still show through. Twisting some of your hair back looks pretty like this, too. 

### 28\. Simple With Side Part 

![Simple With Side Part](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/0bf1c8f4-0e55-4a04-b129-50d2d5cc3e73~rs_768.h-cr_0.90.1080.1530)

_[Photographer: Judith Rae Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/judith-rae-photography-palm-beach-shores-fl-520764),__Hair: Awilda Vega_

Let your curls cascade down your shoulders and back by just leaving them down. This looks so pretty with polished, defined curls, and you can make it feel a little extra special with a deep side part. This is the perfect hairstyle for a simpler bridal look. 

### 29\. Soft Brushed-Out Curls 

![Soft Brushed-Out Curls](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/08e3efe3-aeba-49f3-be4e-c611f3d1a397~rs_768.h-cr_0.91.1094.1550)

_[Photographer: Ruét Photo](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/ruet-photo-georgetown-tx-768995)_

Opt for a more casual and boho-inspired look by brushing out your curls for a fluffier look. This is soft and romantic, especially when you use a hair accessory like a headband or flower clips. This is a great look for long curly wedding hair. 

### 30\. Elaborate Updo

_[Photographer: Julia K.](https://juliakaptelova.com/)_

Pile all of your curls on top of your head for an elaborate updo made for one of the biggest days of your life. "I love the extremes," says Monaè Everett, celebrity hairstylist for [Sally Beauty](https://www.sallybeauty.com/). "Big, structured curly styles with volume and accessories are a favorite of mine." 

### 31\. Low Updo 

![Low Updo](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/1b2ea151-dfff-4cbd-a762-2d2ea6b062f8~rs_768.h-cr_0.14.1094.1473)

If you want your hair to be a bit more sleek rather than too curly, but you don't want to give up on the curls completely, opt for soft waves. This long curly hair for a wedding is undeniably glamorous, especially when you keep the front slicked down and add a sparkling hair clip. 

### 33\. Floral Accents

You might feel like there's not much to do with short, curly hair, but that's definitely not true. Keep your curls hydrated, healthy, and shiny, then add some floral accents throughout—tiny baby's breath like this is such a good idea. 

### 34\. Sophisticated and Classic Updo

This vintage-inspired updo is a classic for a bride. Pin all of your curls into an intricate updo, leaving some tendrils out around the face for a more romantic look. You can accent this with tiny flowers, pearls or both. 

### 35\. Half-Up Hairstyle

This simple half-up hairstyle is a favorite for a reason. It's super versatile, wears well throughout the night, and shows off your curls nicely. Pull your hair back loosely for a softer look. 

## What to Know About Curly Hairstyles for a Wedding 

When it comes to [choosing a wedding hairstyle](https://www.theknot.com/content/choosing-a-wedding-day-hairstyle), you want to opt for something that you love and that fits with the rest of the day, so consider things like your dress style, the venue, and the time of year and day. You should also [ask your hairstylist](https://www.theknot.com/content/questions-to-ask-your-hairstylist) for their opinion on what works best with long-wear curly styles, as they might have some insider tips on how to help prevent frizz and flyaways. Here are some other things to think about when looking for a hairstyle. 

### The weather should be a consideration. 

Temperature and humidity play a big role in naturally curly hairstyles. Think about when you're getting married: What time of the year is it? What is the climate like in that area? What is the weather generally like around that time? "Humidity is no joke, especially for textured hair," Everett explains. "If your curls are tight and healthy, they're more likely to shrink with moisture in the air." If you're getting married outside or during hot and humid months, Everett recommends a style that embraces the curl and its natural tendencies or an updo. A downstyle that covers your shoulders is better for cooler weather. 

The wind should also play a role in your choice. "When it comes to weather, I let brides know that face-framing and romantic wispy tendril pieces are lovely, but with high winds, you may end up with pieces flying into your face or lip gloss, and have the pictures to capture it," Portalatin notes. 

### A structured and polished look may last longer.

When it comes down to it, you'll need to decide between soft, romantic curls or structured and defined curls. Natural curls can experience excess frizz and volume unintentionally, Portalatin explains, and that's something to think about if you want your wedding curls to stay perfectly in place all night long. "I love a voluminous, fluffy curl style, but it is much harder to control the amount of volume that the curls get over time due to weather, humidity, wind, excess movement and more," she says. "It's totally possible to achieve this with a curly bridal stylist who knows how to bloom volume into the hair over time, but having a realistic expectation of how voluminous your curls can get is important to keep in mind." She recommends more structured, polished and defined curls to maintain the style throughout the night. 

### An updo is ideal for brides who want to stay on the dance floor. 

Similarly, curly hair bridal updos are the way to go if you really don't want to be stressed about the condition of your hair throughout the night. Not only do they keep hair off your shoulders to keep you from getting sweaty, but they are also more likely to stay in place no matter how much you're shaking it on the dance floor. "A style that keeps curls lifted or partially pinned up can preserve your look longer," Everett says. "If you love how you look with your hair down, think about half-up options that keep your hair off your face and camera-ready." 

### Look for hairstyle inspiration photos based on length and texture. 

When looking for inspirational hairstyle photos to show a stylist, the advice is generally to look for someone with hair similar to yours. This can be hard to do with curly hair, but Everett recommends noting how your hair behaves. "Does it hold curls or stretch out by the end of the day? Do you deal with frizz, shrinkage or dryness? Choose inspiration pictures that reflect your hair's texture—not just a curl pattern, but the fullness, the length and how it handles styles," she advises. 

### Maintain a curl routine before the wedding.

If you want to show off your natural curls for your wedding, then it's important to ensure they're looking their absolute best. That means putting in some work for weeks or even months before the big day. "Start prepping at least six months out," Everett says. "Focus on moisture and strength. Hydrated curls react less to humidity and healthy strands hold styles better." She recommends weekly deep conditioning treatments (this can be done at home) and strengthening products. Portalatin has the same advice, saying that brides with curly hair should be cleansing and conditioning every seven to 10 days. "For color-treated curly brides, I highly recommend bond-building protein treatments once or twice a month to ensure your curls will retain their strength and integrity for your wedding style," she says.

### The style of your dress makes a difference.

Your gown matters when it comes to which hairstyle you choose—you want a hairstyle that complements the dress, not something that works against it. One specific thing to keep in mind is the neckline. "If you're wearing a high collar or halter outfit, I recommend an updo to prevent covering up your neckline," Portalatin says. "Strapless, spaghetti strap and lower cut necklines are beautiful with cascading and down hairstyles that can be swept over one or both shoulders." She also likes an updo for any dress with intricate detail or embellishments on the back so that hair doesn't get caught in any beadwork. 

### Keep your hair length in mind when selecting a hairstyle.

The length of your hair plays a big part in how your hair will look in a certain style. Portalatin loves a half-up look for short to medium-length hair, noting that medium and long lengths lead to more options. If you want a specific hairstyle but feel like you don't have the length to pull it off, hair extensions are the way to go, even with natural curls. "Curly hair extensions can provide extra length as well as volume to lower-density brides and come in all types, like buns, ponytails, clip-ins and halos," Portalatin says. 

### A hair trial is essential. 

A [hair trial](https://www.theknot.com/content/prep-for-hair-and-makeup-trial) is worth the extra time and expense. "It is not only a great opportunity for you to see if the curly bridal stylist you chose is a good fit for you in terms of personality, budget and overall vision, but it is the perfect time to go home and try on your wedding attire right afterward to see if the entire ensemble comes together the way you envisioned," Portalatin says. "A trial allows you and your stylist to experiment with different options that work best for you while being able to tweak and adjust prior to the wedding."
