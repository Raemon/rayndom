Thanks to recommendations from couples on The Knot

Diane Bagaoisan Photography is a Sonoma-county based photographer who treasures everything about her job - especially her couples, their love story, and the people they share it with. When her grandma was living with Alzheimer's Disease, Diane witnessing her slowly forget the most important people in her life, and the memories she had built over the long life she lived, was the most difficult thing to experience. Since then, she's shifted the way she photographs weddings - preserving moments, big & small, for everyone to look back at and cherish, is now what drives her and her passion for photography. From the quick but loving glances your guests give you as you walk down the aisle, to the long-awaited first kiss as a married couple, to the silly and candid reactions of you & your guests when your Best Man does his toast, to the drunk-filled last dance of the night - Diane Bagaoisan Photography will be there to capture it all for you and your loved ones to treasure for a lifetime.

Diane Bagaoisan

Owner

I've been married to my husband since 2016, but we've known each other since 2001 (since middle school)! We have a dog named Rafi & we had our first child in 2021. I know this is supposed to be "About Me" but my husband, dog, and daughter are part of me. My family & friends are also part of me, as well as my Filipino heritage. I'm more than just a photographer. I'm a grand-daughter, daughter, wife, mom, friend - this is who I am first. And we can be friends, too! Being a wedding photographer is just a bonus =)

Oh geez, I don't know where to start with how much I loved working with Diane! We originally worked with her for our engagement shoot, and from the beginning she was responsive and...

all of her communication was detailed and transparent. She put so much time into getting to know my partner and I so that she could capture us in a genuine manner, and also so that she could help us feel as comfortable as possible taking photos (it was our first time taking photos professionally, and neither of us is super comfortable in front of a camera). Taking the photos was so much fun, and her final product captured that so incredibly well. We were OBSESSED with the photos. Her Instagram really captured her skill and artistry because we saw them in our final products, too. Working with her for our wedding was such a clear choice! In the process of preparing for the wedding, she again collected so many details from us to make sure she understood what kinds of photos we wanted, and her timeline for the day ran perfectly! We got every shot we wanted, and she checked in along the way to also get any photos we hadn't thought about leading up to the wedding. She is an absolute PRO!!! Not only that, but she brought so much joy, light, and fun to the day. Our guests loved her too!! I heard so much from them after the fact about how they felt like she was somehow everywhere all at once, not a moment to be missed!! The wedding JUST happened, and we already have LOTS of sneak peeks that look incredible. We absolutely loved working with Diane, and seriously cannot recommend her more highly. She is an absolute joy and gem, and we will absolutely be working with her in the future for any special occasions we want help capturing. THANK YOU DIANE!!

ocess. She came early on the day of the wedding to scout areas to take photos and helped out SO much while my family was setting up. She was so thoughtful in her suggestions and did everything she could to make us all feel comfortable. After the wedding, she was quick to send us our sneak peeks and continued to inform us on the status of our gallery. She sent us the most amazing package of prints and some extras- including treats for our dogs. She exceeded our expectations and I would highly recommend her to anyone.

If you're looking for someone to capture all the beautiful moments for your big day - big and small - there's no better photographer than Diane. Diane was the photographer for our ...

Bay Area fall wedding, and she was incredible from day 1 - responsive to all our questions, warm and professional to talk with, and most importantly, fun and open to hearing all our ideas. We really wanted a photographer who would capture candid moments of our loved ones throughout the day, and Diane's focus on capturing all the fun really shone through in our wedding pictures. Our family and friends remarked on how warm and sweet Diane is, and how much she helped them feel at ease while taking photos and candids. She was also incredibly helpful in helping us figure out our timeline given that we had a ton of extended family photos to take - she's so organized that we actually ran AHEAD of schedule on our wedding day, which I never thought would happen! The photos we've seen so far have been divine, and we are so grateful for all the love and care Diane put into documenting the big day. Diane is an incredible photographer and we highly recommend her to anyone looking for a wedding and event photographer - she's just the best!

part of our family. Diane was so accommodating when weather messed up our original engagement photo location and even suggested doing another session to make up for time lost. At the wedding, I really wanted candid shots and she delivered! The pictures are perfect and really capture exactly how our day felt. Everyone loved her and we were so sad when the event was over and she had to go. The photos Diane sent us are extremely high quality and we have them displayed all over our home. Friends and family always ask who our photographer was and I almost wish I had a stack of her business cards to hand out to them. I couldn’t suggest Diane more, and I can’t wait for another excuse to hire her again! Thank you again Diane for making our engagement and wedding so special!

After the wedding was over she quickly got us some sneak peak photos. Once all the photos dropped we were AMAZED. They looked great! Also her website allowed us to order framed photos. The packaging is top notch and the framed photos look great. ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND DIANE for your wedding.

h a plan for our engagement photo shoot that was perfectly tailored to us (botanical garden + a local brewery). She also did a lot of the prep work for the actual event, coming with us on venue tours/rehearsal, drafting a timeline for us, and scouting a location for the first look (since we couldn't use our venue for it). On the day of, she went above and beyond, arriving early for getting ready photos and staying late to make sure she got some photos of the dancing. She kept things moving during the posed photos to so that we were actually ahead of schedule (!) even though we had asked her to do an ungodly number of combinations of family/wedding party photos. We didn't have to think about anything all night - she came and grabbed us when she needed us, and she already knew what shots she wanted to get. And she got our sneak peek photos to us the next day, and they came out so great! Loved working with Diane and would gladly do it again!

We received major compliments from our engagement shoot and I'm confident that our wedding photos will be no different! In addition, she was such a great resource as we were creating our big day. She had invaluable advice from vendors to timelines and everything in between. She is a real gem of a person and photographer and we will definitely be booking her again for some of her portrait work in the future!

Finding a photographer who would make us feel comfortable while making us look our best on our special day was important for us. We found much more than a photographer with Diane. ...

She was our hype woman, location scouter, vendor referrer, and nerve reliever! Diane has become more than just our wedding photographer to us, of all the vendors we hired we agreed that Diane was our favorite to work with! We had her capture our engagement shoot and our wedding day. Not only did she scout our engagement shoot location but she trekked along with us to find the perfect scenery to paint a background in our photos. Everything felt natural with her from whispering our In N Out orders in each other’s ears to studying each other’s faces to capture the right moment without ever feeling like we were being directed to pose a certain way. She went to our wedding rehearsal to tour our venue location to get a feel of the best spot to take photos (none of our other vendors aside from our coordinator were at our rehearsal I felt this was really above and beyond that she did this). We even got a couple shots for memories of us rehearsing. Leading up to our wedding day we didn’t hear from a lot of our other vendors and had to proactively reach out (blame it on the popularity of weddings this Sept/Oct) but Diane had proactively reached out to us and was always very responsive. Our wedding day she brought along a second photographer and the both of them were a blast. 3am after our wedding I got a message from Diane with preview photos from our wedding. I already told my husband that we’re going to Diane for holiday family photos and would not hesitate to recommend her to any other couple. She is seriously one of the best decisions we made for our wedding.

She actually called the venue ahead of time to get permission which gave us unfettered access to the location to take photos after the proposal at which time she directed us all around the castle and vineyard, helping us pose, and the pictures turned out AMAZING.

This review is long overdue! My husband and I got married on August 1, 2020. Yes, smack dab in the middle of COVID. We had been planning our wedding for a little bit over 1.5 year...

s. We wanted to make sure everything was perfect for our guest list of 400, so we started the wedding planning early. Then COVID struck and all our wedding planning went down the drain. Many of our vendors had cancelled on us, while other vendors were not flexible (causing us to lose our deposits). After weighing out all the additional money we would lose, we decided to carry on with our original wedding date. We cut down our wedding from 400 people to 25 people (immediate family in the same households). Our original photographer had cancelled on us and our friend recommended Diane. We were so lucky she was available. Diane was literally our saving grace! From day one, during our first Zoom call, we could tell that Diane was organized and passionate in the work she does. She is very detail-oriented and talked us through the whole process. We were already so stressed with having to re-plan our wedding over and over again to meet COVID guidelines, but Diane helped make the process so smooth. She coordinated with our wedding venue directly before the day of wedding to plan the locations of our photos. She even visited our venue before our wedding day to get an idea for the perfect lighting! She literally thought of everything! Above all, there was one particular detail that really demonstrated how remarkable she is at what she does. We didn't even mention it to her, but one thing we were excited to have at our wedding venue was this large square crystal chandelier in the dining hall for our first dance. Unfortunately, since our reception was cancelled, as COVID restrictions prevented indoor dining, we had to cancel our chandelier (and lost our deposit from the vendor). Come to our surprise, the venue had the same chandelier in the dining/reception area during the day of our wedding just for staging. Diane saw the chandelier in the venue and went above and beyond to coordinate with the manager so we can take photos under it! Diane took gorgeous photos at our original venue for our ceremony. We had our reception in the backyard and the photos she took in our background looked so incredible! They looked just as magical as if we had the reception at the venue! Overall, Diane was the best vendor we worked with during this stressful wedding process. I feel so awkward in front of the camera, but Diane made me feel so comfortable! She is so professional, friendly, detail-orientated, organized, and overall is genuinely passionate in the work she does. Even after the wedding, she continued to communicate with us to keep us in the loop until we received our photos. Lastly, on a side note, her photos were so remarkable that our wedding photos were actually featured in Diablo Magazine! If you are searching for a photographer, for any event, I highly recommend Diana Bagaoisan Photography! You will not regret it!

Your wedding day was everything (btw, you and Andrew totally rocked it all day, even when it was like 100 degrees outside!!) and it was as if I was celebrating with family. So many great memories were made and I will treasure you both and our time together for a lifetime!

We are so grateful for Diane, and my friend who referred her because she made our wedding day unforgettable! When the pandemic hit we had to change our 150 person wedding to just u...

s in a church. We just wanted to get married and so we hired a photographer to go take pics in our favorite spots after the church ceremony and it turned into a magical intimate and even sexy sort of couples therapy/spiritual retreat shoot. Not only did the pictures turn out AMAZING, but we got soooooo much more from the experience. As someone who HATES taking pictures, Diane made me feel comfortable and she really focused in on us. She had us recount loving memories, say our favorite things about each other and even had us dance in a gazebo to our song, which she played on her phone. She really made a day that could have been a glaring reflection of the pandemic into a special, unique and beautiful experience my husband and I will never forget.

ally drew us to her was her unique style. She doesn't just shoot stuffy formal shots, she captures the atmosphere, and as soon as we saw our photos we were in awe. We also received several comments from family members about how impressed they were that they hardly noticed that she was there during the ceremony instead of blocking the view of the guests to get the shot, like most photographers. Thank you, Diane, for helping us relive our special day over and over with our beautiful photos!

Diane was our photographer for our intimate 85 person wedding. It was a second marriage for both myself and my wife - so we had lots of family, and even our 3 children involved. ...

Diane did an absolutely fabulous job - on the engagement pictures, the wedding itself, and then on a large format - 20 image - metal frame photo wall we crafted for our living room afterwards. So what made Diane so special? I would say first and foremost is her ability to capture the spirit of each of the most important people in the wedding. For example, in the engagement photos - she captured perfectly the playfulness of my step-son (14), the animal-loving of my oldest daughter (13) and the confident beauty of my youngest daughter (10). The pictures she took of our family together brought forth the spirit of our integrated family. And for my wife and I together she captured our new love in creative ways with images that flattered us both. At the wedding, she did some very smart things. Before the wedding, she had an assistant - and captured lots of details from both separate preparations of the bride and the groom. At the wedding itself, she caught all of the special moments - once again specializing on bringing out the spirit and personality of individual subjects. We now have amazing pictures of my mother-in-law, my dad and my aunt, captured in their best light. Once again, she also caught the small details of place settings, flower arrangements, the venue itself, that bring to life the overall spirit and feel of the wedding. It all came together in our photo wall... Instead of a traditional album - what we decided to do was fill a large living room wall we have with a 9 ft x 3 ft arrangement of 20 photos and collages - from the proposal, our engagement, the wedding, and our honeymoon - to tell the story of our new family and life together. Diane help us with the photo selection, the cropping, photoshopping small imperfections and lighting corrections. This was really important because she helped us not just with her own photos, but also photos I had taken for the proposal and the honeymoon - that needed a lot more fixing! This is also where it paid off to have great pictures of each family member - and each of those little details . She put together mock spreads so we could simulate how it would look before printing and hanging. Then she used her industry contacts to help us order the actual metal prints from a high quality printer at a very reasonable price, with her industry discount. The overall impact is stunning... we have beautiful photos that capture the spirit of our entire family in a gorgeous installation - that we get to look at every day, and is a constant conversation piece whenever we have visitors. All in all - I would highly recommend Diane, for her acute eye, creativity as artist, craftsmanship with her cameras and software - and ability to execute on complex projects that capture the real narrative and spirit of an entire wedding!

We cannot say enough amazing things about Diane! Photography was extremely important to us while planning our wedding; these are images you will look back on for the rest of your ...

lives. And by choosing Diane for our wedding photography, we have all of our wonderful memories beautifully captured to look back on forever. She captured the big moments so eloquently and also managed to capture everything happening around us at the same time! She has a knack for observing the entire situation and focusing in on all the candid details that make your day so special. We get so many compliments on all of our wedding photos, but some of our personal favorite pictures are from during our ceremony. Diane captured our family members and guests during our ceremony so we were able to see our loved ones reactions to us finally tying the knot! In particular, our moms looking at each other smiling and crying happy tears. It was quick moment between them that we didn't notice, but she did! And we are so glad she did because it was so special to see that and have that moment captured! Not only is Diane extremely talented behind the camera, she is genuinely a wonderful human being who cares so much about her couples, their families and guests. Our families and friends loved working with her. Everyone still talks about how magnificent Diane was!! Thank you Diane for giving us beautiful memories to look back on forever! You are absolutely incredible!

om her past experiences. She even made a trip to us from Modesto to meet us in person and get a feel for our venue, which we really appreciated since we were based in Southern California. For the day of, everything ran as smooth as possible (with a large wedding + bridal party) and she was very good at keeping us as on schedule as possible. She was also good with letting things happen and going with the flow- we really wanted a split between posed and candid photos, and she got a great mix of both for us! The online gallery and the physical set of photos were delivered on time (actually, quicker than she originally told us!) and were really everything we were hoping for. The jewel case with physical photos really stands out as something unique that always catches someone's eye when we have people over. We couldn't be happier and are very glad we went with Diane for photos!

Diane and I met when we were both freshmen in college in Sacramento. I came back to Southern California to finish school closer to home, but we remained friends on social media. I ...

witnessed her career as a professional photographer take off, and I was definitely impressed by the quality of her work. 10 years later, my fiance and I were searching for a photographer- I immediately thought of Diane. I felt comfortable knowing it was someone I knew and someone whose work I trusted. We scheduled a phone conference and my fiance also realized that we had found our wedding photographer. She worked with us to set our timeline, pricing, listening to our concerns whilst sharing her experiences and giving us her honest opinion. When everything was set and done, Diane met with us a day before to scout the locations (3 separate locations for the wedding day), talk about our preferences and set a timeline. When the day of the wedding came, she was punctual and arrived at a house of coordinated chaos! The wedding day was absolutely perfect, and as stated by my family, "Your photographer is everywhere! She's so fast!" Diane was spotted in all parts of our home ceremony and reception, making sure to get amazing photos of our family and friends celebrating with us. We definitely recommend Diane to anyone searching for not only wonderful pictures but for a great experience with a vendor to whom you entrust an important occasion. Diane embodies what a true photographer is; knowledgeable, observant, organized, creative and understanding of their clients. You'll be enjoying your wedding (or any other event) knowing that your most important day is being taken care of and that the photos will be spectacular. And we're pretty proud we get to be her first wedding clients in Southern California too! Thanks for everything Diane! We appreciate it tremendously. Beatriz and Varun
