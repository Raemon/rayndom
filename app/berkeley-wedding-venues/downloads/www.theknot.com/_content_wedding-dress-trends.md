Updated Oct 18, 2025

As a fashion editor at The Knot, I can't help but notice the shift in the shopping habits of modern brides. While choosing a dress that feels "timeless" was once a priority for many, the focus today is much more personal—it's about finding something that feels like _them_. And after taking in the 2026 wedding dress trends at New York Bridal Fashion Week over the past few days, it's safe to say that designers are following suit. The latest wedding dress trends lean into high-fashion details, maximalism and individuality like never before, whether in the form of full-on feathers and oversized bows for the bold bride or fresh takes on otherwise traditional details for the classic one. Needless to say, there's something for every bridal style among the [wedding dresses](https://www.theknot.com/fashion/wedding-dresses) that will hit the racks at your [local bridal salon](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/bridal-salons) next fall. Keep scrolling to see the trends that lie ahead.

## Top Wedding Dress Trends for 2026

Over 1,000 wedding dresses and a week of presentations, appointments and cocktail parties later, I'm happy to report that the bridal dress trends destined to dominate fall 2026 are more exciting than ever. [Nadia Manjarrez's](https://www.nadiamanjarrez.com/) modern interpretations of beloved bridal details are calling to the classic dresser, while those looking to don as many wedding day looks as possible won't be able to take their eyes off of the multitasking designs and accessories showcased at[ Jenny Yoo](https://www.jennyyoo.com/), [Justin Alexander](https://justinalexander.com/justin-alexander-signature/) and [Viktor&Rolf](https://www.viktor-rolf.com/en-us). And for the cool girl, [Daughters of Simone](https://daughtersofsimone.com/) wowed with gowns, minis and suit separates resembling treasured finds straight from the racks of a chic vintage shop—and these standouts hardly scratch the surface of what 2026 wedding dress trends have to offer.

While you can't get your hands on these styles just yet, you _can_ get a preview of what's to come according to the [2026 New York Bridal Fashion Week](https://www.theknot.com/content/new-york-bridal-fashion-week-2025) runways. From romantic pleated fabrics to gloves, capes and tights galore, read on to learn more about the wedding dress trends I saw on repeat in NYC this week—and the ones you'll get to see IRL next fall.

**Top wedding dress trends for 2026:** Bows | Bold Florals | Decorative Buttons | Bubble Hems | Feathers | Sheer Elements | Drop Waists | Suiting | Pleats | Accessories & Extras






### 1\. Bows




Much like lace, florals and freshwater pearls, bows could almost be considered a bridal staple at this point. However, designers have only continued to surprise us with fresh iterations that move far beyond functional accents. From the oversized satin bow that tops [Monique Lhuillier's](https://moniquelhuillier.com/pages/bridal) feather mini dress to the four structured bows scattered across [Pnina Tornai's](https://www.pninatornai.com/) shimmering strapless gown, this season's offerings are much more about making a statement. Meanwhile, [Sareh Nouri](https://www.sarehnouri.com/) debuted a long-sleeve lace ball gown with a row of dainty bows trailing down the corset bodice and one on each sleeve, ideal for the bride who may prefer a more minimal take.

### 2\. Bold Florals




Florals certainly aren't anything new to the wedding dress world, but fall 2026's offerings _actually_ feel groundbreaking. This season's blooms embrace texture and depth like never before, whether through bold appliqués à la Nicole + Felicia and [Nardos](https://www.nardosdesign.com/collections/ss26-bridal) or the single oversized rosette sculpted through the voluminous skirt of [Justin Alexander's](https://justinalexander.com/justin-alexander-signature/) "Muse" gown. While daintier takes do still reign, they feel like a breath of fresh air; Designers like [Elie Saab](https://eliesaab.com/pages/bridal-fall-2026) and Sareh Nouri showcased styles adorned with 3D florals seemingly sprouting from the fabric, while Francesca Miranda's collection, aptly dubbed "Rosas," includes a halter neck gown made entirely of hand-crocheted blooms.

### 3\. Decorative Buttons




The fabric-covered buttons commonly used on bridal dresses aren't just functional—they're also _beautiful_. This is why I wasn't the slightest bit surprised to see designers rethinking the role of this classic detail and embracing it in unexpected ways throughout their latest wedding gown collections. [Ricca Sposa Couture](https://riccasposa.com/colections_type/wedding-ricca-sposa/) and [Galia Lahav](https://www.galialahav.com/), for example, both placed rows of decorative buttons along the frontside of corseted bodices. On the other hand, Nadia Manjarrez used them along the hem of a strapless pleated top and at the seam of a rounded drop waist, complementing understated designs with just the right amount of interest.

![Corset A-line wedding dress with decorative button trend](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/7ec6cfb8-3a6e-42f0-91fe-c5d5f7a9124e~rs_768.h-cr_412.454.4632.6080)

### 4\. Bubble Hems

From opulent, Bridgerton-esque ball gowns to Carrie Bradshaw-inspired dresses with removable layered skirts (Who doesn't love a built-in second look?), it was hard to go a single day at NYBFW without seeing a bubble-hem dress cross my path. Jenny Yoo's came in the form of a strapless drop-waist gown with an eye-catching high-low hem, which was perfect for showing off a pair of black lace tights. [Ines Di Santo](https://inesdisanto.com/pages/our-bridal-collections) brought us an unexpected spin on the trend by incorporating it into the trumpet skirt of a textured two-piece. And while a bubble-hem mini may hark back to '80s prom dresses or the wardrobe staples of the early aughts, Nardos's iteration is the epitome of elegance and sophistication. Another bubble hem I couldn't take my eyes off of was that of a strapless Viktor&Rolf gown with a removable skirt, which allowed the dress to transform from full-length to high-low.

![Jenny Yoo high-low bubble hem strapless wedding gown](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/f67160ba-47c5-422a-91f8-bc3b4a9e2a1b~rs_768.h-cr_0.286.2400.3486)

### 5\. Feathers




Unlike the bridal feathers that defined seasons past, next fall's will feel much more like a staple. Designers showcased them as an integral part of even the most classic wedding gowns, bringing them far beyond fun after-party outfits and accessories. [Nicole + Felicia](https://nicoleandfelicia.com/) left jaws dropped after debuting a scoop-neck gown finished with a tiered ombré feather skirt, while [WONÁ Concept](https://wonaconcept.com/) debuted a trailing, feather-trimmed cape that completely made the look. Then there's [Francesca Miranda](https://francescamiranda.com.co/pages/trunk-shows-bridal), who scattered subtle feather accents across a strapless A-line dress and paired it with a matching veil. Love the look but prefer a sustainable route? Enter the textural masterpiece that is [KYHA's](https://kyhastudios.com/) "Peach" jacket. It wasn't until Claire Murphy, KYHA CEO, pointed it out to me that I learned the jacket was made entirely of organza.

### 6\. Sheer Elements

Unlike illusion wedding gowns, which merely appear sheer through the use of fabrics in skin tone-like shades, this daring wedding dress trend ditches the lining completely. [La Premiere](https://lapremierebridal.com/) leaned into the look by pairing a crisp white corset top with a lace skirt that lets the legs peek through, while Monique Lhuillier showed off her completely sheer, long-sleeve lace "Rowan" gown atop a bustier bodysuit. For brides seeking a bit more coverage, [Arava Polak's](https://www.aravapolak.com/) subtly see-through designs provide an excellent alternative. Take the brand's "Elise" gown, for example, which has a fuller skirt and a few more layers of fabric but still shows a hint of skin when caught in the light.

![La Premiere see-through wedding dress trend for 2026](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/c908a068-3296-445c-acad-3c7e206162fb~rs_768.h-cr_0.668.4000.6001)

### 7\. Drop Waists

While drop waists have been popular among the wedding dress world and beyond for a few seasons now, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention just how prevalent they are in the wedding dress collections of fall 2026. In fact, I don't know that I can pinpoint a single collection that _didn't_ include a drop waist. More importantly, designers are continuing to impress with iterations that feel fresh. The KYHA Studios "Lotus" gown is defined by its drop-waist bodice and asymmetric A-line skirt married by an eye-catching ruffle detail. [Milla Nova](https://millanova.com/) went the maximalist route by dressing up an off-the-shoulder drop-waist gown with ruched details, a voluminous peplum and dainty bows. Then there's [Julie Vino](https://www.julievino.com/), who went for a streamlined sweetheart neckline gown with a sleek bodice, full skirt and pockets.

![Strapless drop-waist wedding dress by KYHA Studios](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/10206a13-00a0-47c9-a76b-aa84909817ae~rs_768.h-cr_0.85.1024.1450)

### 8\. Suiting

Suits may be classic, but they haven't always been made with brides in mind. This season, designers are changing that. Brittany Castaños of Daughters of Simone (who happened to be wearing a taffeta silk tuxedo gown I simply _couldn't_ get over) debuted a variety of breathtaking suit separates alongside her latest gowns. [Alexandra Grecco's](https://alexandragrecco.com/) latest collection, "The Great Occasion," also included a few suits: one relaxed, dusty blue number and one romantic burgundy option with a cropped jacket and wide-leg pants. Another standout? A beautiful fitted jacket and midi-length skirt from [Wiederhoeft](https://www.wiederhoeft.com/), which is decorated with intricate embroidery, beading and statement buttons.

### 9\. Pleats




Be it a dramatic pleated gown like the Danielle Frankel number [Alexandra Daddario](https://www.theknot.com/content/danielle-frankel-celebrity-wedding-dresses#:~:text=Alexandra%20Daddario%27s%20Wedding%20Dress) wore for her iconic New Orleans nuptials or something with the delicate micropleats Nadia Manjarrez is known for, pleats of all kinds popped up in the collections of countless [wedding dress designers](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-to-find-wedding-dress-designer-you-love) at NYBFW this season. Manjarrez, of course, brought us some in the form of a whisper-soft tulle gown with a romantic sweetheart neckline, and [Watters](https://www.watters.com/) wowed with a crinkly, gauze-like strapless number with a coordinating neck scarf. [Hera Couture](https://heracouture.co.nz/) showcased a few pleated styles as well, but I was especially taken aback by the brand's "Aquila" gown, which is covered in hand-ruched soft tulle that cascades into a fluted train reminiscent of a waterfall.

### 10\. Accessories & Extras

Just when I thought bridal accessories had reached their peak, designers proved me wrong by taking things to a whole new level for fall 2026. [OUMA Bridal](https://www.ouma.co/) styled their latest collection with sheer scarves and dramatic ruffled capes, while Jenny Yoo and [Idan Cohen](https://houseofidan.com/) went the unexpected route by opting for tights, gloves and neck pieces in contrasting black. Then there's Justin Alexander, whose designs were complemented with everything from button-up riding jackets to removable sleeves, along with [Renhue](https://renhue.com/collections/bridal), whose strapless "Joan" mini dress seamlessly paired with both a floor-length sash and a long-sleeve lace top. Turns out even the best wedding dresses will benefit from a few extra special touches.

## How to Take Wedding Dress Inspo From the Runway

The beauty of wedding fashion—and your wedding day in general—is that it's all about you. In other words, you get to wear whatever you want. Whether that means diving headfirst into the most maximal version of a current wedding dress trend or simply incorporating subtle touches of it into your bridal outfits, the key is to identify what makes you feel like the best, most confident version of yourself. [Trying on wedding dresses](https://www.theknot.com/content/top-dress-shopping-secrets) can help you decide what trends you'd like to take from the runway to real life.

### Why are 2026 wedding dresses shown in 2025?

The unveiling of 2026 collections in 2025 caters to a crucial part of the wedding planning process: the timeline. In fact, the dresses we saw at this season's [Bridal Fashion Week](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-fashion-week) will land in salons at just the right time for 2026 brides. According to [The Knot Real Wedding Study](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-data-insights/real-weddings-study), the [ideal time to buy your wedding gown](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-gown-shopping-checklist#:~:text=According%20to%20The%20Knot%20Real,10%20months%20before%20the%20wedding.) is eight to ten months prior to your event date. This will allow enough buffer time for things like production and [dress alterations](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-gown-alterations-101) with plenty of time to spare. So whether you want to window shop a few of the latest trending wedding gowns or are looking for specific wedding dress suggestions, getting to know the looks from the runway will easily help you plan ahead for your own big day.

### When will we see these wedding dress ideas in bridal stores?

Brands showcase their designs about a year ahead of when they're due to be sold in-store. This means that you'll be able to find all of the above trending [wedding dresses online](https://www.theknot.com/content/virtual-shopping-guidelines-wedding-attire) and in bridal salons by this time next year.
