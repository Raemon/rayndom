This short three-tier wedding cake is simply stunning. Wrapped at the base of each layer with white roses and greenery, it manages to feel complete without anything extra.

## **Three-Tier Wedding Cake Cost**

So exactly how much _is_ a three-tier wedding cake? Philadelphia's Frosted Fox Cake Shop owner Jennifer Low, who has more than 15 years of experience in wedding cakes, shared her two cents on three-tier wedding cake prices. She reveals that they typically cost $7-10 per slice. However, she highlighted that the final price depends on "how elaborate the design is and how far the cake is traveling."

Her bakery's smallest three-tier cake will feed about 35 people and typically costs between $250 and $350. The average cost of a three-tier wedding cake for large receptions can quickly total up to $1,500, although she noted that "there's no one-size-fits-all price."

## **Three-Tier Wedding Cake Sizing**

When considering three-tier wedding cake sizes, Low shared that the first thing to do is decide whether or not you want to save your top tier to eat later, like on a first anniversary. If so, that layer will not count towards the amount of cake needed to feed wedding guests. For 50 attendees, she suggests that a baker should make "a 4-inch diameter tier, atop a 7-inch diameter tier, atop a 10-inch diameter tier." However, depending on the design, slightly larger cakes will be more appealing to the eye. In which case, the couple would score some leftovers.

To feed 100 guests, Low notes that two sizes would work well: a cake with a 6-inch diameter tier, atop a 9-inch diameter tier atop a 12-inch diameter tier, or a cake with a 6-inch diameter tier, atop a 10-inch diameter tier atop a 14-inch diameter tier.

When asked about the three-tier wedding cake size for 150 guests, the renowned Philadelphia baker shared that she typically uses a 6-inch topper, an 11-inch middle layer and a 16-inch bottom layer, diameter-wise. Though these proportions are not her favorite, she often recommends couples choose a smaller size or a taller cake to display and get a "kitchen cake to get to the desired serving count."

## **How to Cut a Three-Tier Wedding Cake**

Low joked that the best way to cut a three-tier wedding cake is to "let your caterers handle it." But, if you don't have the professionals ready to help with this [time-honored tradition](https://www.theknot.com/content/cutting-the-cake), start by "slicing the entire top tier (or set it aside to save), then remove the plate it sits on and move on to the middle tier." Follow a slicing chart to ensure you get the right number of slices from each layer and be mindful of the supports inside the cake, such as straws or wood dowels, as you cut. Lastly, Low told us that "wedding cake slices are often thinner than birthday cake slices because the cakes are tall and everyone has likely had a lot of food already."
