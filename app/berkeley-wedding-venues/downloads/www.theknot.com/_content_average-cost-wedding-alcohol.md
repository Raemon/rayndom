**Wedding Alcohol Cost For:** 50 Guests | 100 Guests | 150 Guests | 200 Guests




## How Much Does Alcohol Cost for a Wedding?

Internal data found that the majority of couples end up serving some type of alcohol or liquor at their wedding (at least 80%, if you're curious). So how much is alcohol for a wedding on average? Based on data from all over the country, real couples spent $2,800. Yes, this might seem like a big chunk of change, but most couples deem it a worthy expense. Especially after to-be-weds hear their guests raving about the tasty [signature wedding cocktails](https://www.theknot.com/content/your-ultimate-signature-cocktail-finder) and enjoy the [wedding drink station ideas](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-drink-station-ideas) the bartender has brought to life for their celebration. 

### Average Cost of Alcohol for a Wedding for 50 Guests

To make the calculation as simple as possible for the average wedding alcohol cost, we multiplied the typical price per person, which is between $15–$45, by the number of guests. On the low-end, the cost is $750 and on the high end, it's $2,250. But remember, there are other aspects that come into play, like the duration of the wedding, the kind of alcohol offered and whether or not your guests are heavy drinkers. 

### Average Cost of Alcohol for a Wedding for 100 Guests

Based on the previous formula, the average alcohol cost for a wedding of 100 guests is at least $1,500 and at most $4,500. Once you reach the 100-guest mark, your [average wedding cost](https://www.theknot.com/content/average-wedding-cost) is going to jump up, just like your alcohol prices. That's why the best decision for your wedding budget may be cutting down your guest list. 

### Find your kind of venue

From barns to ballrooms, discover reception venues that feel like you.

### Average Cost of Alcohol for a Wedding for 150 Guests

The average alcohol cost for a wedding of 150 guests ranges from $2,250–$6,750. One of the many reasons the prices are higher for 150 guests is because you'll probably need more than one bar at the cocktail hour or reception to decrease long lines.

### Average Cost of Alcohol for a Wedding for 200 Guests

It's no surprise that a higher guest count equals higher alcohol prices. The average cost of alcohol for a wedding of 200 guests is between $3,000–$9,000.

## Wedding Alcohol Cost Factors

Open bars were a big hit at weddings last year, with 58% of couples offering guests a full open bar, complete with beer, wine and hard liquor, at their reception. But the [open bar wedding cost](https://www.theknot.com/content/open-bar-wedding-cost) can be expensive for some. Ryan Manka, alcohol expert and beverage director at [Butler's Pantry](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/butlers-pantry-st-louis-mo-540994), says the service style is a big influence on price,"whether the couple opts for an open bar, a limited selection or a consumption-based model." Rodolphe Boulanger, vice president of wine merchandising at [Total Wine & More](https://www.totalwine.com/) and drink enthusiast, agrees. He adds that having endless choices isn't always for the best. "Another impact on the cost of alcohol is the selection that guests can choose from," says Boulanger. "It's great to have a large selection, but providing too many options could lead to overbuying and a lot of unused bottles." (By the way, the more experienced the pro making drinks is, the higher the [wedding bartender cost](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-bartender).)

What's the price of a slice?  ](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-much-do-wedding-cakes-cost)

If having a full open bar isn't your thing and [saving money on alcohol for your wedding](https://www.theknot.com/content/ways-to-save-on-wedding-reception-alcohol) is, you have alternatives. For example, 17% of couples served beer and wine only. Keeping to this pair of beverages is a great option for couples who want to offer their guests an open bar experience without spending too much. The presence of [cash bars](https://www.theknot.com/content/is-a-cash-bar-acceptable) remained similar to previous years at 6%, even though there's still debate about if it's acceptable to have one. And if you're planning a dry wedding, you're certainly not alone. Our study found that 9% of couples who married last year chose to abstain from serving booze, which eliminates needing an alcohol budget for the wedding.

Despite the discrepancies between the types of wedding bars, there's one thing 40% of respondents had in common: a champagne toast. Whether couples married in a forest, a backyard or a ballroom, a little less than half of them raised a glass of bubbly at their reception. And don't think there's only one celebratory way to serve champagne at your wedding. If your budget allows, consider having an elegant [champagne tower](https://www.theknot.com/content/champagne-tower) or hiring servers that wear tiered, structured skirts to hold the champagne glasses and add a wow factor to your wedding.

Manka and Boulanger bring up two more things you might not have thought about in relation to the cost of liquor for a wedding: "The guest count has a direct impact on alcohol costs, but demographics play an important role as well," Manka explains "A cocktail-forward crowd may call for a more robust liquor budget, while a group that leans toward wine or beer could shift the overall allocation. Understanding your guest profile helps tailor the bar offerings and manage costs more strategically." Boulanger suggests being flexible if you want to save money and adds: "Serving big-name brands at your wedding can be an expensive choice, depending on the brand. It's worth the time and money to do the homework and shop around when choosing what you'll serve at your wedding. You and your guests can still have a great time and enjoy great tasting beverages while drinking lesser-known gems."

## How Much Have Typical Wedding Alcohol Costs Changed Over the Years?

The average cost of alcohol for a wedding stayed the same between last year and 2023 at $2,800. For weddings in 2022, the expense was $2,400, which is $100 more than the cost in 2021 and 2019. Want to know the ["why" behind wedding price tags](https://www.theknot.com/content/why-are-weddings-so-expensive)? Manka says these national averages are affected by global supply chain disruptions, like ingredient shortages, and inflation, which leads to higher prices for alcohol. There is also a trend of guests expecting more premium, curated bar experiences and couples feeling the need to participate in [wedding cocktail trends](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-cocktail-trends), like offering locally sourced, sustainable drinks.

But no matter what kind of alcohol budget you have, you should have a professional caterer or bar service handling all the details. Some wedding venues will allow you to bring your own alcohol, which can cut down costs. "Going through Total Wine can be a more budget-friendly option compared to ordering through the venue," says Andrea Albicocco, senior director of marketing at [Total Wine & More](https://www.totalwine.com/) "Plus, depending on your state, you may even be able to return unopened bottles and get money back." Regardless of where the bottles come from, licensed bartenders must do the serving. And don't forget to [tip your bartenders](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-vendor-tipping-cheat-sheet), as they'll be working hard to keep your guests happy.

Percentages aside, do what's right for you, whether that's having a full-service open bar or serving creative wedding mocktails. "Offering a selection of great beverages, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic, at your wedding is a great way to celebrate this special occasion and ensure a memorable experience for your guests," Albicocco says. Cheers to that!
