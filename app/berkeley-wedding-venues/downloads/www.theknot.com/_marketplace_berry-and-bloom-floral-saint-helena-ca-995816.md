We worked with Karen as the florist for our wedding in May 2025. We were impressed with her can-do attitude. What really stood out to us was her ability to supply florals on what e...

nded up being her busiest weekend (Mother's Day). She even helped us repurpose the flowers from our ceremony decor for the reception. Karen's experience in the field was evident - she had clearly worked at the event space before and it showed in her attention to detail and ability to manage multiple tasks. While a few of the corsages were delicate, they still looked beautiful and added a nice touch to the overall look. The value she offered was well worth the cost - we felt like we got a good deal without sacrificing quality. Overall, we would recommend Karen for any wedding or event needing florals - she truly knows her stuff.

ick to respond whenever I had any questions and was so flexible with all the different adjustments we had to make leading up until the wedding day. Not only were the flowers STUNNING but she also went above and beyond to help make sure the arrangements made it to the variety of locations at the correct times (seriously, she is so incredibly sweet and it made me such a relaxed bride knowing she had it all covered). Her designs were beautiful, her suggestions were creative and overall very very affordable for such high quality. She even went to the effort to set up vases on the sweethearts table for my bouquet! If you want someone who will think of all the little details you will forget as you plan your wedding and is truly such a delight to have around on your special day, I can’t recommend Berry & Bloom Floral enough!

t we envisioned for our wedding, and viola! Everything was just perfect. We were blown away on how she totally brought our vision to life! She was extremely professional. She arrived early, set-up the flowers on schedule and even stayed until after the ceremony to move flowers to the dining room. Choosing a florist without having seen their work can be a bit of a gamble, but with Karen we had no doubts. We highly recommend her!

n. We were referred to them by our close friends and could not have asked for a better florist for our wedding. Karen is wonderful to work with and will make your dreams a reality.

y attentive and helped build out my vision that would stay within my budget. She showed me a trial of my centerpieces over video, which was so creative and incredible, and then incorporated any feedback I had. During the wedding day, she built a beautiful arch draping with hanging orchids - it was stunning! All the florals were amazing and Karen really took the extra care and went out of her way to make my wedding aesthetics perfect!

Berry & Bloom was beyond a doubt, the best florist I could have hired for my Napa wedding. I had already consulted with several other florists before meeting with Karen, and while ...

their work was impressive, none quite captured the look I was going for. Then my mother and I met with Karen, who was warm, personable, and incredibly talented - and seemed to know exactly the style I was hoping. In fact, the flowers were above and beyond my expectations - I said several times "These are the most beautiful flowers I have ever seen" and took many photos of them. I was actually sad we were leaving for our honeymoon and could not take the flowers home with us for a week! She was just unbelievable, and not only delivered on the centerpieces that I had envisioned but also made a beautiful arch for our wedding ceremony. Karen seems to be a well-kept secret in Napa, but I think word will be getting out regarding her talent very soon!
