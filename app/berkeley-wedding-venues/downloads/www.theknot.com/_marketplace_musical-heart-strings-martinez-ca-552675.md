uly exceptional musicians with an incredibly large repertoire. Choosing the music with them was so much fun — they had everything from classical pieces to pop, Disney, and even EDM. They’re detail-oriented, empathetic, and such a joy to work with. Our guests couldn’t stop raving about the music — some were even singing along to Bohemian Rhapsody and Disney classics! The atmosphere they created was elegant, emotional, and full of life. One of my favorite moments was when they performed “Levels” by Avicii — an EDM song they learned just for me. It was such a fun and memorable highlight that my friends are still talking about. Hiring Musical Heart Strings was truly one of the best decisions we made for our wedding. They brought so much heart, professionalism, and joy to our day. I can’t recommend them highly enough!

Hire Musical Heart Strings, you won't regret it! We had always dreamed of having a live string quartet at our wedding, and Musical Heart Strings truly brought that dream to life. ...

One of the most special elements we wanted was a custom arrangement of the bride’s processional song: a softer, lighter version of Love Wins All by IU, based on a rendition by YouTube pianist James Wong. We spoke with a few local string quartets, but the moment we connected with Gretchen, we knew she was the one who could make it happen. Gretchen immediately knew the pianist we were referring to and mentioned she had even done custom arrangements of his work before, including a beautiful blend of Lover x Daylight. From the very beginning, she was incredibly engaged and genuinely cared about making the arrangement perfect. She was always communicative and thoughtful, offering detailed insights and suggestions with every email exchange. Whenever we asked for adjustments, she responded quickly and sent updated audio clips for us to review. She even created multiple versions in different lengths to help us find the one that fit our timeline best. When we heard the final version, we were absolutely thrilled. It was everything we had hoped for. On our wedding day, Gretchen and her team played for two hours. They performed during guest seating, for the bridal party processional and recessional, and during our cocktail hour. The music was flawless, and they created a beautiful, elegant atmosphere that we’ll never forget. Gretchen has an incredibly extensive repertoire on her website, covering everything from classical pieces to video game soundtracks, movie themes, and modern pop songs. We got to select every song ourselves, which made the experience feel even more personal and special. We are so happy we chose to work with Musical Heart Strings. If you're not looking for a full quartet, they also offer duo and trio options. Gretchen is a true professional and artist, and we can't recommend her highly enough.

Musical Heart Strings are the best! My wife and I reached out to a couple of different violinists to see who could play at our wedding ceremony. We got some responses back but non...

e made us feel as comfortable as Gretchen did. From the very first meeting, she understood our vision. She knew exactly what was required to give us the best service possible. With the many meetings we had with Gretchen, she would always assure us that we had nothing to worry about, and she could not have been more right about that. Musical Heart Strings has a long and extensive repertoire of songs to choose from, which is one of the biggest reasons they drew our attention. We wanted a very specific song for myself to walk down the aisle to (Regalo De Dios by Julion Alvarez) and unfortunately, they did not have that song in their repertoire. When I mentioned it to Gretchen, she assured me I had nothing to worry about. We found the music sheet online and with ease, they were able to learn it and play it for us. It was beautiful. Our guests even told us how their music added to the ambiance and how every time they hear those songs on the radio, it reminds them of the ceremony. And these are the types of moments that I will cherish forever. And it was all thanks to Gretchen and Kerry. You can not only see the chemistry, but you can feel it between them as they are orchestrating. The professionalism and care given to my wife and I during one of the most stressful times of our lives, was second to none, and I cannot be more grateful for them. With that being said, I would absolutely recommend them to anyone and everyone!

You went out of your way to reach out to the violinist to help give me a clue of what the entire clip sounded like, which made this much easier to pull off. It was such a beautiful song! We couldn't have done it without your help! As a result your wedding was PERFECT. Congratulations.

erformance added an air of elegance and emotion that elevated the atmosphere to something magical. We were able to pick so many favorites from their expansive repertoire and they seamlessly wove them together. They had excellent communication during the months leading up to the event, especially since we did custom processional songs. They were so great to make sure that we appeared at the exact time we wanted and it was so beautiful and exactly what we envisioned. One thing that stood out was their professionalism and attention to detail. They arrived early, worked seamlessly with our wedding coordinator, and made sure the sound levels were perfect for both the outdoor ceremony and cocktail hour. The duo played with incredible precision, yet their performance was full of warmth and emotion. Each note was played with such care and beauty—it was clear they put their heart into every piece. Many guests commented on how their music added an unforgettable ambiance to the day. Overall, if you're looking for a musical experience that will leave your guests talking long after the event is over, I can't recommend Musical Heart Strings highly enough. Their talent, grace, and passion for music were truly a gift to us and made our wedding day all the more memorable.

If you are looking to add some beautiful music and something special and unique to your wedding, you have found what you are looking for. Stop searching and reach out to Gretchen, ...

now! My fantasy of having strings play as guests arrived, while I walked down the aisle and during our cocktail hour was brought to life and then some by having Gretchen and Kerry at our wedding at a private home in Oakland this month! Their music was stunning and flawlessly performed. They really went the extra mile to support me in planning and executing what I had dreamed of for the day! They have an amazing repertoire of modern and classic music (go to their website and listen to some snippets, what they do is so cool!). We were so impressed by the breadth of what they offered and truly struggled to narrow down my song list (we started with something around 50 songs that I was excited to hear played - Gretchen had to reign us in a bit ;p). They are generous and accommodating - I was so tickled that Everything Is Awesome was int their repertoire and they happily indulged me by playing it a second time, when I missed it being played while we took family photos. They also exceeded my expectations in their composing of a song that I wanted for my processional, but was not in their repertoire. Not only are they musically wonderful, they are kind, clear and prompt communicators and very organized, which made the whole process of working with them a pleasure. My parents helped me plan my wedding and Gretchen and Kerry personally made each of us feel special and appreciated. They made my new husband and I feel celebrated and cared for before, during (Gretchen saved the day with a pair of nail clippers when the groom forgot to clip his nails before arriving to the venue ;P) and in the weeks since the wedding - they really do it all! I feel so lucky to have found them! If I lived in the area, I would find excuses to hire them again and again, in a heartbeat!

Their music during the prelude was so touching it almost had me in tears—seriously, I was this close to ruining my makeup before walking down the aisle! Everyone was raving about how fabulous the string quartet was and how it made the ceremony feel even more magical. Huge thanks to Gretchen and the team at Musical Heart Strings for making our wedding day so memorable with their music. We offer them our highest recommendation.

ve stressful situations only because they tend to be very revealing in terms of people’s character, and great character is important when you’re working on a potentially very stressful event like a wedding. Well, two weeks before the wedding, the groom decided to veto a key piece of music that was going to be part of my vows. Within a tight timeframe (and our limited budget), Gretchen took the initiative to search for a musical score that would suit a backup piece of my choosing and got me and Kerry into her home for a last-minute rehearsal. They didn’t have to do any of this and yet they did. I am forever grateful for their grace, support, and willingness to accommodate us when they didn’t have to. From the beginning, Gretchen was so communicative and well-organized, and I just loved the sheer volume of samples on their website (which was also very mobile-friendly). Other than our caterer, Gretchen was the most communicative and on-top-of-it vendor I worked with. It was so enjoyable working with both her and Kerry and they played beautifully for our wedding ceremony and cocktail hour. They played everything from pieces from The Hobbit to Lady Gaga, and many other selections from their extensive repertoire. Now, I am looking forward to hopefully having Gretchen as my cello teacher. Excellent musicians, excellent people. Lots of love to musical heartstrings!

My husband and I have a special attachment to Ghibli films, and so we felt like it was a must to request some special arrangements from our favorite films. Gretchen arranged beautiful pieces from “The Wind Rises” and “Howl’s Moving Castle” to play during our ceremony. Gretchen made special effort to ensure that we heard the arrangements in its entirety, and she even played for us when we were taking bridal party photos before guests arrive! Gretchen also made an extra special arrangement for my bridal procession where she included by favorite section of the piece, and played it at the right moment during my walk. The timing couldn’t have been better. Their performance was everything we had hoped for. We even had our guests come up to us to ask where we found such talented musicians! After they finished playing, Gretchen greeted and congratulated us personally, which we appreciated All of these small gestures mean so much to us.

The cost of this extra service was very reasonable and led to a personalized wedding experience that was exactly as I had imagined. On the day of the event, the performers were very skilled and played beautifully. They flawlessly hit their cues in the wedding ceremony and our guests loved the extensive collection of music they played during the cocktail hour. Musical Heart Strings has a vast library of classical music, movie tunes, and pop songs to choose from, so any mood you want to set for your event can be done easily.

We hired Musical Heartstrings for my daughter’s wedding last month at Deer Park Villa, a redwood grove venue in Fairfax. The string trio gave the venue a warm and elegant ambience,...

and Gretchen was one of the most responsive and friendly vendors we dealt with. I cannot say enough good things about her. We wanted my nephew to sing an Italian aria before the ceremony began, and even though it was not in their repertoire, Gretchen made it happen and even practiced with him beforehand. The choices for both the ceremony music and the cocktail hour were plentiful; we found exactly what we wanted. The flower girls twirled down the aisle to the sound of John Legend’s “All of Me” and the bridal party and groom entered with the triumphal score of “Jurassic Park,” which I — the MOB — thought an odd choice, but which turned out to be astonishingly beautiful. The cocktail hour was delightful with the trio playing in the background. Best of all, Musical Heartstrings won’t break your budget, which is something to factor in when you’re planning a large wedding. My daughter and I will definitely recommend the trio to friends planning future weddings. Thank you, Musical Heartstrings!
