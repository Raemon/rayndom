Events Director

I’ve always enjoyed making people happy – be it through music, food, or corny jokes. I have worked for The Purple Orchid since May of 2021, but have been in the hospitality industry for a little over 10 years. Every day is uniquely special at The Purple Orchid for me. We pour our hearts into the weddings we get to work on and take a lot of pride in what we do here. We look forward to opening our home to our guests to be theirs for the weekend. We want each of our couples to leave with memories that will last a lifetime, but to also leave as a member of the Purple Orchid family as well!

re so personable and helpful throughout our entire wedding planning experience. The day after our wedding, we forgot our leftover cake at the venue, and Rhiannon was kind enough to drive 35 miles to our house in Walnut Creek to bring it to us (thank you, Rhiannon!!! 🙏🏻❤️). We were blown away by the attention to detail and dedication to making our wedding weekend an experience we will always cherish. We even received a thoughtful Christmas gift from the Purple Orchid to celebrate our first holiday season as a married couple - such a thoughtful gesture that touched our hearts! Our wedding coordinator Taylor was such a pleasure to work with from our very first introduction to our wedding day, always meeting us with the warmest welcome and kind demeanor, while super organized and professional. We knew we were in good hands with Taylor helping us curate the wedding of our dreams. As soon as we arrived for our wedding weekend, Taylor was there with the most calm and reassuring spirit, easing any worries we had about our big day. Having our close family members and wedding party able to stay on-site with us made all wedding logistics so much easier, from hosting our rehearsal dinner by the pool, to getting ready the morning-of in the bridal and groomsmen suites. The entire weekend was so much more intimate and special. All the rooms were beautiful and the staff was there to help with anything we needed. Our wedding day itself was so incredibly beautiful! So many of our wedding guests still compliment us on what a wonderful time they had, and that it was the best wedding they’d ever been to. Thank you to Rhiannon, Derek, Taylor, and the entire Purple Orchid team for making our wedding weekend a dream come true! ❤️

I felt zero stress on my wedding day and it was all because she made the day go seamlessly. On top of their services, it was a huge benefit to be able to stay at the hotel the night of the wedding. They handled all set up and tear down, and assisted with packing our car before we left. The staff are helpful and kind, and I really, truly could not imagine getting married anywhere else.

he wedding in it, and then got married right before another huge wave. The staff at the purple orchid were there to help every single step of the way. Rhiannon and Taylor were so incredibly responsive when we had questions (and we had SO MANY) and helped us pivot our plans multiple times - including moving the entire event outdoors less than two weeks before the day when a new covid variant appeared. The staff the day of was attentive, on top of everything, and extremely accommodating. We were also impressed with the relationships that the Purple Orchid had with almost all of our vendors - the vendors knew the owners personally and it was clear that they had positive working relationships with one another. Also, we went with almost all the vendors on their recommendation list - not only were the vendors top notch, they were also within budget and I felt like the Purple Orchid was always keeping that in mind for us! Aside from all the covid arranging and rearranging we had to do, The Purple Orchid is also just a stunning location for a wedding…I still can’t believe how gorgeous the whole day night was. I’ll be forever grateful everyone who helped make it this way, but especially to Rhiannon and Taylor - thank you thank you thank you!

e had to navigate postponing our event. Once the wedding weekend finally came, no detail was left unanswered as our family and friends arrive. The rooms are impeccable and comfortable, the property is gorgeous, and happy hour each day was lovely. The staff hired for the events were friendly, kind, and organized. Our wedding went off without a hitch, and Derek Rhiannon, Taylor, and the catering staff were simply incredible. The venue itself is also stunning, and between cocktail hour at the pool, and dinner in the olive orchard, it was a perfect setting for our perfect day. THANK YOU, Derek, Rhiannon, and the Purple Orchid Staff for hosting us for a whole week, and giving us the best memories to look back on. We can't wait to spend our anniversaries here!!

accommodated. When we realized that a bigger wedding would not be possible because of COVID, Rhiannon worked with us to reduce the wedding size to 32 people. Before the wedding, Rhiannon worked with us on every detail to make sure the day of the wedding went very smoothly. The day of the wedding was very stress free and went fantastically—we were able to lean on Rhiannon and her team for everything. Through Rhiannon, we worked with Pleasanton Rentals for all supplies and worked with Dave’s catering for food—both places exceeded our expectations. Additionally, we rented out all of Purple Orchid for the occasion, so our guests were able to fully enjoy the rooms and all the amenities. Our guests loved Purple Orchid so much that they made bookings for a later time the next day! We would highly recommend Purple Orchid to anyone looking for a private and serene wedding on the Livermore country. -Jess and Jashwal

Writing this review breaks my heart. Orchid did a lot right, but what went wrong was unacceptable. I waited almost nine months (we got married last summer) to write this review to...

make sure that my feelings didn't change given perspective. I would not recommend this location as a wedding venue, especially if they are still working with Valley Catering. I'll be writing a separate review for Valley Catering, but they served a wrong menu at our wedding, disregarding our explicit requests and instructions. Our contract required us to use this catering service- we didn't have a choice. The food was GROSS and most of my guests left hungry. I'm leaving out a lot, but the first sign of trouble was a day or two before the wedding when Orchid staff sent the bridal party and other guests staying the night of wedding a request for payment for the very expensive rooms that they KNEW my family was gifting them. Several of our guests were uncomfortable accepting the rooms for free after that.) A free couple massage was offered with the wedding package. The venue recommended that we take advantage of the spa the day after the wedding, which sounded great, so we did. It was the middle of summer and a very hot day, so we couldn't leave the leftover flower arrangements in the car during the massage. I paid a lot of extra money to get the flower arrangements made with ample succulents. Keep in mind that I know flowers would die anyway, but I grow/collect succulents and had plans to create arrangements using the plants from our wedding that would have lasted many years. One of the owners told us that we could put our flowers (including my bouquet) in a cool room until after our massage. By the time we got out of the massage (which was just okay), all of our flowers were gone, except the bouquet, which apparently they deemed worthy of keeping for us. The staff had called the florist and had her come collect all of our arrangements (what the hell????). They then made US call the florist and WE had to go rescue our flowers. They literally handed us a phone and a phone number and walked away. The staff was completely unwilling to help or correct their mistake. Two or three (I forget now) of our arrangements went missing and were never given to the florist. I spent the day after my wedding in tears. My parents did tell me that they received reimbursement for the missing arrangements as part of the money we got back given the unacceptable errors given our menu. Also to the venue's credit, they did send me a small succulent arrangement as a sort of apology, but I gave it away. I appreciate the gesture, but I don't need a reminder of that incident in my house. More minor frustrations were that both suites had dead bugs all around the rooms. I was picking up dead spiders and bees all weekend, and my maid of honor and her family in the other suite said they were doing the same. It was like they sprayed for bugs but no one came back to clean up the casualties. We also requested that our sheets were changed the night of the wedding because a bridesmaid stayed in the suite with me the night before. They weren't changed. To be fair, though, I never brought these more minor issues to the venue's attention. I can't forgive Orchid for these memories. I only plan on getting married once, and we can't those moments back. Especially for the cost, I should't be left with these negative memories of my wedding and the surrounding weekend.

I honestly don’t even know where to start with how amazing of an experience we had at the Purple Orchid for our wedding. First off, the price is unbeatable in that area when you c...

onsider all-inclusive wedding venues (i.e. rentals, food, alcohol) especially when you consider the fact that the price also includes 10 rooms (in which you can have up to 24 people stay) and brunch the morning after your wedding. Another major benefit of this venue is their indoor and outdoor space. With us getting married in November we were aware of the possibility of rain so we wanted a venue that offered both outdoor and indoor options, the purple orchid checked that box! Not to mention the free couples massage is definitely a plus as well! One of my main “wants” for my wedding was to have amazing food and their caterers fully provided that, we have gotten so many compliments on our food choices and how it’s some of the best food people have ever had at a wedding! Speaking of compliments, the venue itself is to die for with its multiple backgrounds for photos and the “magical” reception area in the olive grove. Danelle and Caitlyn honestly are what really put the icing on the cake for this whole experience for us as well. They both were willing to continually answer my random questions throughout my entire year of planning. Not only that, but if I mentioned something in email, they almost always remembered and brought it up during our meetings. They made some serious magic happened and were willing to go to all lengths to make this a smooth and stress-less situation for us. From making suggestions, to helping us think of things we hadn’t thought of, to even finding a DVD player for the room we were having the kids babysat in they are both so incredibly hard working. They also consistently worked with our other vendors so we did not have to handle a lot of the receiving of things the day of. I provided their team with specific instructions on how I wanted to set up my décor and honestly they did the most spot on job with only a few changes that I honestly ended up liking more. Danelle, Caitlyn, and team honestly made this a dream of a wedding and I cannot thank you enough!!

I just got married at the Purple Orchid less than 2 weeks ago, and it was amazing! The site is so beautiful, and you can really make your wedding almost like a destination wedding ...

even if you live locally. We had our rehearsal dinner on site Friday night, wedding Saturday night, and brunch Sunday morning before everyone left. It was awesome to have our families stay on the property with us and spend more time with them throughout the weekend. As the other reviewers mentioned, Danelle, the on-site coordinator, is fantastic. She works with you as much or as little as you need, and takes care of so much! From ordering any extra rentals you want to setting up your guest book table and other day of details, she is truly awesome. And while weddings aren't cheap, you get a pretty good bang for your buck at Purple Orchid. I could go on and on about the Purple Orchid, but it is truly a spectacular wedding venue and I would highly recommend it to any bride looking for a smooth and stunning wedding experience!

My Husband and I got married at Purple Orchid on July 8, 2017. We live here, in Livermore, that had a huge influence on where we were married. We love all of the beautiful wineries...

in town and originally thought we would get married at one. We hadn't thought to get married anywhere else...but when we looked into the Purple Orchid as our Venue, it was an immediate match for everything we desired! The ambience is wonderful and the Olive orchard makes for the prettiest pictures! Did you know that they have an on site event coordinator? Well, they do and her name is Danelle and she is the best!! She helped us every step of the way! We cannot thank Danelle enough for making sure our wedding day went smoothly! We ended up renting the venue Friday and Saturday! Our guests had a lovely stay in the guest rooms and the bride and groom suites were perfect for getting ready! The day before the wedding we used the pool area for our rehearsal dinner, such a fun setting, we decided to keep it casual! Derek, the owner, was around in the later hours to make sure our needs were being met and he was very attentive and helpful as well. If you're looking for a great venue, with an on site coordinator, options to rent guest rooms, picturesque landscaping, and tons of awesome preferred vendors, then we highly recommend Purple Orchid for your wedding!

This place is absolutely repulsive. They have zero regard for compassion towards human beings. My sister was engaged for 6 months. She chose purple orchid as the venue for her wedd...

ing. Fast forward, after a devastating and heart breaking stream of events, she was forced to call off the engagement just a couple weeks after she had put down her $5,000 deposit. She called purple orchid to explain her devastating situation and asked if there was any possibility to get her money back. She was told that there was absolutely no way that they could provide a refund, and had the audacity to ask her to sign a document to release that date so that they could rebook. We completely understand that the venue is under no obligation to refund her. She did not expect them to refund her right away. She asked them if she could get her money back if and when that date is booked and locked in by someone else. Their answer was a firm no. Essentially she paid them $5,000 just to have her name on their books. They now have that date available and they will be profiting off of someone else and get to keep her money as well. This is complete robbery. The lack of compassion possessed by this business needs to be out there for other people to be aware of as a warning. If they lack the decency to not profit off of someone's misfortune, who knows what else they are capable of. This is a money hungry business and they do NOT have your best interest at heart.

The owners know their stuff and were a huge help with both little and big details. They have an onsite wedding coordinator who helped with everything. She even stepped in as an emergency back up make up artist when mine backed out at the last minute. When we first met with the owner and wedding coordinator we walked away wanting to be friends with them. Every time we met (or emailed) with them we felt at ease. They supplied a fabulous list of preferred vendors, from DJ to caterer, to wedding cake baker, and efficient. We chose the two-day package. Renting out the 10 rooms for Friday night and Saturday. I highly recommend doing this. It made everything so relaxing. The caterer is fabulous. He even figured out how to do bacon wrapped tater tots for us as a late night snack. The cost included almost everything. -Venue for Friday night, Saturday, and Sunday (for brunch) -Bed and Breakfast Guest rooms (10 rooms for two nights, with breakfast) -Linens and chairs (including plates, and all that Jazz) -Food and Alcohol -Day of wedding coordinator (who helped leading up as well) \- Sunday Campaign Brunch We absolutely loved the Purple Orchid and we HIGHLY recommend them. They have two day and one day packages. They are fabulous. All of our guests commented on how lovely the venue was, how good the food was, and how much fun they had. If you are looking for a place that is romantic with folks who will make the planning process easy, and your day extra special then the Purple Orchid is for you.

Purple Orchid is such a beautiful gem in the hills of Livermore only a few miles from the busy downtown. The owners are such great people and so accommodating. The property is so b...

eautiful and peaceful we knew this was where we wanted to get married the moment we got there after looking at six other venues. They definitely know how to plan a wedding and keep everything on time. The on-site wedding coordinator was so helpful and really kept me on task with getting all my vendors together. We met every few months to talk about the planning process, any changes or new ideas. We did a weekend wedding there so we had guests of the wedding in all the rooms, our rehearsal dinner was on site Friday night, on Saturday we did wedding prep in the bridal suite and one of the spa rooms and the wedding ceremony & reception in the evening, on Sunday morning we did a brunch for the bridal party and guests staying in the rooms before they all headed back home. It was so fantastic to have the property to ourselves for the most part and have family and friends around all the time to mingle and catch up. The whole weekend long the wedding coordinators helped keep everything on time based on the timeline that we built together and went so smoothly it was actually really amazing. We did not have to worry about a thing on the wedding day it all went off without a hitch all due to the amazing wedding coordinator and staff at POI. Highly recommend staying here, getting married here, or using their spa services. All around an amazing place and we are so happy to have gotten married there!! We plan to go back for our one year anniversary to retreat to the peaceful hills of Livermore.
