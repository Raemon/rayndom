I cannot recommend Sarah enough! After some truly horrible spray tan experiences in the past, I was so hesitant to try again… but Sarah immediately put me at ease. She walked me th...

rough the process, helped me choose the perfect color for my skin tone, and made sure I felt completely comfortable. She came right to my home for my bachelorette spray tan, and I loved the results so much that I booked her again to come to my wedding venue and spray me and my girls for the big day. She was professional and organized, and even with everyone on different schedules, both she and her assistant were so patient and accommodating! The color was beautiful and lasted through 2 outfit changes and dancing all night. The biggest thing for me was my hands. With previous tans they turned out super orange...but not with Sarah's spray tans! And when it finally started to fade over the next week it wasn’t blotchy at all. If you’re on the fence like I was, don’t be! Sarah is truly the best! I’d recommend her to anyone looking for a flawless, natural-looking tan and a completely stress-free experience from start to finish!

So happy with how my bridal tan and process went! Sarah went above and beyond for me and all my bridesmaids! She drove over 3 hours to come tan us the day before my wedding and the...

color was flawless. She has so many different color options to tailor to your skin tone. Will definitely be using her again and I highly recommend her to anyone in search of a spray tan artist for any occasion!
