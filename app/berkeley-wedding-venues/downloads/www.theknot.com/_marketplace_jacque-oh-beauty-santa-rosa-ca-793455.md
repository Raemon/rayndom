Jacque was recommended to me for my wedding hair and makeup by a friend, but is now who I got to to get my hair done. There are a million reasons why Jacque deserves 5 stars, but I...

'll give you my top 3. 1\. When I first met Jacque I was very unhappy with the color of my hair. I explained why I was unhappy, what I was afraid of because of past experiences (turning my hair blonde) and what I wanted. She took the time to explain in detail how she was going to fix my hair and get it back to the color I wanted. Her explanation made me feel so comfortable that I trusted the process even though it involved adding some blonde. When she was done, I was speechless with how great it turned out. Which is amazing, but what's even better, is she went and wrote down exactly what she did so my hair turns out the same color every single time I see her. I have never had another stylist in my entire life who has managed to keep my hair color the same more than 3 times. 2\. I knew what I wanted my bridal hair to look like before I even knew what kind of dress I wanted. An up-do that I could be taken down for the reception. When I went in for trial, Jacque made my hair look exactly how I imaged and provided the tips I needed to take it down later as a practice run for the day of. My mind was set that this was how my hair was going to be, and then I watched an episode of Love is Blind that completely changed my mind. I called Jacque two weeks before my wedding telling her I was torn, she recommended another trail. She squeezed me in and I am so grateful she did, because the Love is Blind hair is what I ended up going with and I couldn't have been happier with it. The last thing I will say about the trial is that people tend to struggle with a foundation color for me because of my freckles, but not Jacque. She got it right on the first try! 3\. The wedding day was flawless. Jacque brought two other stylists to help her and everything ran like clockwork and everyone look gorgeous! Not only that, but she made me a custom lipstick of the big day. A color made just for me! She also had lipsticks my wedding party could purchase day of. I've been a bridesmaid 10 times, and the lipstick is the first part of the makeup to go with out any options to reapply unless you bring your own (which I never remembered). This is just one example of how she goes above and beyond. If you are looking for someone to do your wedding hair and makeup or just a new hair stylist in general, look no more. Jacque is professional, kind, fun, consistent, and amazing at what she does

Jacque, is very punctual and works fast. She has an excellent personality and can easily fit all her hair and makeup services at any location. She even sells her own makeup, that...

she makes, which I love and now use regularly. She did my hair and makeup for a professional photo shoot on site. My hair and makeup looked super natural yet, was enough for camera and everyday wear. Nothing was over done, she checked in with me constantly asking my preferences. I wish she would have been available for my wedding. She books up fast, so I recommend reaching out her as soon as you know your dates. I liked my makeup so much more than my wedding makeup artist. I highly recommend Jacque!

My daughter-in-law hired Jacqueline to do hair and makeup for her wedding. Jacqueline, Katy, and Sammi made the bridal party look exquisite. We each had our hair beautifully done t...

o our own taste. Jacqueline has a gift for the up-do. Our makeup was absolutely beautiful and did not feel too heavy or overdone. I was concerned that I wouldn't feel comfortable with a new do and makeup but I needn't worry. I loved it and everyone looked great the entire evening. Thank you!!
