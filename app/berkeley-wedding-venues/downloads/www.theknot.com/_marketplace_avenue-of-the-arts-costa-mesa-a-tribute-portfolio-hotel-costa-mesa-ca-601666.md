If you’re looking for a beautiful wedding venue in the heart of Orange County and you are considering the Avenue of the Arts Costa Mesa – look no further! This venue is truly som...

ething special. We held our wedding reception at AoA and the space strikes the perfect balance of elegant, romantic, artsy, and classy — paired with incredible service and a very convenient location. We chose AoA based upon a friend’s recommendation, and we couldn’t be happier with how everything turned out. From the start, Veronika Mikhaylova, the Senior Catering Manager, made the entire planning process feel organized, calm, and manageable . We planned this wedding in a little less than 6 months and our friends were impressed with how it came together so beautifully on such a short timeline - Veronika and her team made it happen! She was incredibly responsive, detail-oriented, and genuinely invested in bringing our vision to life. Veronika coordinated seamlessly with our vendors, helped us think through logistics we hadn’t even considered, and ensured our cultural traditions were handled with care. Knowing she was overseeing everything gave us real peace of mind. We also hosted our rehearsal dinner at the hotel the night before in the outdoor garden, and it was absolutely beautiful. The fairy lights, food, and service created such a romantic atmosphere, and it was so reassuring to know everything was taken care of. On our wedding day, everything came together perfectly. The ballroom looked stunning, the lobby decor and gift table were beautifully arranged, the food and drinks were a huge hit, and the band setup and dance floor were amazing. Our cocktail hour by the lake was romantic, and Carlos and the catering team kept everything running smoothly all night. Many of our guests stayed at the hotel and loved the location — especially those flying into John Wayne Airport, who were pleasantly surprised by the complimentary airport shuttle the hotel provided. Our 140 guests couldn’t stop raving about the venue and staff, calling it a true hidden gem in Orange County. We felt so genuinely taken care of and are endlessly grateful to the AoA team for creating a wedding party we will always cherish (thank you, Veronika!). We already look forward to returning for future events and anniversary dinners at the Silver Trumpet restaurant located inside the hotel. 10/10 recommend this venue!

y, the transition was smooth. AoA was perfect for our reception. Great location for cocktail hour and a spacious ballroom for the reception. One of the reasons why we chose AoA was because it is dog-friendly. Although I was pretty bummed we could not have our dogs with us during cocktail hour, we still got some great photos with them. Overall, we had a great experience and our guests complimented on our choice of venue.

I am SO GLAD we had our wedding at AOA! We got married on 10/21/2023 and it was a blast. Kita was very helpful in helping us navigate the details in the months leading up to the we...

dding. At our details meeting, we found out that the previous contact we had been working with miscommunicated when our ceremony would start, and we had already ordered our invitations. Kita heard our concerns and she worked with her supervisor and they were able to make our wedding happen at the time we had on our invitations. This was a huge relief and was one of the many moments I was glad I booked with AOA. They really are a very helpful venue and offer a lot of great perks. We had a personal tasting of our menu and we were able to solidify table setting details and our timeline. We love that this venue included a month of coordinator as well. We went with Erika's Elegance and we do not regret this, she was AMAZING. She really took all my anxiety away and handled everything the day of. I always hear of brides finding out that something went wrong, and but as far as I know everything was perfect the day of! I don't know if everything was actually perfect or if Erika and Kita were just so on top of things I never found out, but either way I am very happy about that! This venue also includes a cake, and we went with Grace and Honey which went above and beyond our expectations! Our guests have all raved about how beautiful the venue was and how delicious the food was (which is saying something since we had a lot of foodies on our guest list!). Everyone at the hotel was so nice, helpful and accommodating throughout the entire day. An added bonus of getting married at a hotel is you get a lot of compliments through out the day as you go about the hotel! I loved it! We got married in the Garden Retreat, which is surrounded by hotel rooms and off the main lobby, however it felt extremely private and we did not have any disturbances from other hotel guests. All in all, if we every decide to renew our vows in the future, we will 100% book again with AOA!!

Monica was kind and helpful throughout the planning process and corresponded via email countless times and also met with us in person a number of times to ensure we had all our questions answered. She was pleasant to work with and responsive. She even did small things like get us boba drinks because we love them so much. There was a sudden weather change during our wedding day and she helped us manage the crisis well when having to relocate our cocktail hour from outdoors to indoors. The staff swiftly moved our decor and vendors indoors before the guests arrived and our guests still had an amazing time not even aware of the last minute location change. AOA's quick action and professionalism really helped made our wedding day everything we imagined and more.

ergetic, sweet, and knowledgeable during our tour so we booked it! After that we were in the amazing hands of Monica. She answered all of our questions quickly, provided suggestions when asked, and was determined to make sure the vision of our reception came true. We purchased one of the wedding packages where the cake was included (all amazing options, but we ultimately went with Susie Cakes) as well as a wedding month of coordinator (we went with Erika’s Elegance, probably the best decision EVER). I have so many great things to say about both Susie Cakes and Erika’s Elegance that I will be writing them a review too to share everything. The food was absolutely amazing and we still get guests from our wedding saying how they had the most fun at our wedding and the food was phenomenal, best food they’ve ever had at a wedding. My husband and I were catered to all throughout the night and felt like the king and queen. In a nutshell, definitely book your wedding with this venue if you want great good, good location, great staff, and all your guests to compliment you on how your wedding was awesome!

We had a wedding here on Oct. 22. We only had about 40 guests and they had just about a perfect sized ballroom for us. We decided to go with the highest priced menu. The food was s...

oooo great. All the guests mentioned how good the food was. The bartender was fast enough to serve drinks without people waiting a long time. Servers were very friendly and professional as well. I have to mention Monica who was a wedding coordinator from Ave of the Art. She was amazing. She made everything happen. From ballroom wall cover to little details on our unity ceremony, she made all worked. Wedding day is already stressful day but she made me worry less and enjoy the day. Everything went as planned. Thanks to Monica. They also have a beautiful outdoor scenery which is a perfect pre-wedding photo. I would recommend everyone to Ave of the Art for their wedding.

the idea of having cocktail at different place than the ballroom area. All the staff here are so accommodating and professional. Our wedding reception looked very nice and gave very different vibe. All our friends loved the location. 😊 I have no words for how amazing Monica is. Right from day one to end she was there for everything. We planned our wedding in just 3 months and it was very hectic. But Monica made sure she is there no matter what. She took care of everything, literally everything . She went out of her way to help us make this as smooth as possible. The day of reception she was present for everything. She made sure I don’t have mental breakdown too when one of the vendors did not arrive in time for setup. She is so sweet I cant stop talking about her. Thank you so much for making our wedding such a memorable one. 😊

Our wedding package also included the wedding cake and access to a wedding coordinator 1 month prior to the event (Erika’s Elegance was phenomenal!). Overall, we were very happy with making Avenue of the Arts our venue for our wedding. Thank you Monica!

One of the best decisions we made was choosing this venue. It's the best of both, with the ceremony being outdoors and the reception being indoors upstairs in the grand ballroom. ...

Monica was an absolute dream to work with. She was ALWAYS so prompt with her communication and sooo sooo helpful all throughout the entire process. The food was great and the package comes with the wedding cake and everything. She really made things as stress-free as it can possibly be. We are so grateful we found this venue.

mony, reception, plenty of photo opps, and a place for our out of town guests all in one location. The entire catering staff was super helpful and we felt like we were in good hands the entire night. Everything was set up so beautifully and exactly as we had imagined, from the full ballroom draping, the table settings, lighting and dance floor. Our guests were raving about the event space, friendly staff, and food (surprisingly the potato leek soup was the favorite). Although Terri is the main events coordinator, Monica is now in charge of wedding events and she definitely proved that she is up for the challenge. Monica was quick to respond to any of our questions and really went beyond to make sure our special day went as smoothly as it could. A major hurdle for us was the 20+ mph winds on the day of and Monica was very communicative to remedy the situation. We ultimately moved the cocktail hour inside which worked out totally fine. We would like to thank Monica for making sure everything behind the scenes went as smoothly as possible. We highly recommend any couple to book Avenue of the Arts for their upcoming wedding or event. They will definitely take care of you.

f the Arts in Costa Mesa. We loved the venue that offered the best of both worlds as we had our cocktail hour outdoors in the beautiful Garden Retreat and our dinner reception indoors in the Grand Ballroom. All of our guests also stayed at the hotel the entire weekend and the convenience and accommodations of the venue and the venue location was a perfect match for our wedding guests. We worked with Terri throughout the booking and planning process, and she did a great job as our venue coordinator on the day of the wedding. The entire catering and event staff was wonderful from start to finish and we felt so well taken care of. Our guests also enjoyed the same type of wonderful experience and we heard so many compliments about the venue service, food, and overall compliments of the hotel staff, banquet and events staff, and the event space. The catering menu and bar menu was personalized to all our needs, and we thoroughly enjoyed our wedding food. Everything was set up so beautifully from the pipe and drape, chairs and tables, dance floor and lighting, with no detail missed. We felt so confident and comfortable with how much Terri and her staff did to take care of us and our guests. I would highly recommend this venue if you're looking for a welcoming and casual boutique hotel, that is also glamorous and modern for a beautiful wedding day. Both my husband and I are in the wedding industry and we've worked with so many venues -- this is a hidden gem and one of our absolute favorites. We can't wait to host another personal event with Avenue of the Arts soon!"

, pleasant and memorable - starting from site touring, booking, menu tasting, and finishing with a rehearsal and assisting during the wedding day itself. The stuff here is very professional, everybody from servers to audio tech provided outstanding service. During menu tasting we met with the chef who customized the menu per our dietary restrictions (vegan option was delicious). The venue itself has a very scenic setup by the lake, there are plenty of locations for wedding photos with various textures and backgrounds (fountains, succulent walls, bridge, flower beds, etc). The ceremony site has small steps like amphitheater but straight, so the guests who sit in the last rows, can see the altar unobstructed. The altar was set up right by the lake which created serene atmosphere. We would like to thank Terri and stuff for making our Big Day as amazing as it was for us. Our guests complimented the hors d'oeuvres and the drinks, as well as the main course. We highly recommend Avenue of the Arts if you are looking to host your event in OC - this place is great and people who work here are a pleasure to work with.
