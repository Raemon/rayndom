And here is another compliment we got from one of our couples My fiancé and I took 5 virtual lessons with Ava for our upcoming wedding. We were skeptical at first as we originally planned to do these classes in person, but if anything 2020 has taught us, it’s how to be flexible! We were so happy we decided to do the virtual classes because it worked out perfect! Ava was responsive, timely and an excellent teacher. She was able to choreograph our first dance to two songs and teach us leading and following, two lifts, dips, and turns, with ease. We cannot wait to show off our moves to our friends and family!

cers and had very little hope of performing well during our first dance. Ava taught us step by step, teaching us one to two moves per lesson so that we were never overwhelmed. She is a fantastic teacher with a lot of patience. By the end of our five lessons, we had a beautifully choreographed dance and were taught how to recover if we misstepped. My husband and I felt ready for our first dance, but still nervous. In the end, our dance was the highlight of our wedding and we received countless compliments on how great our dance was. We highly recommend taking lessons with Ava!

d I do not have any dance background; moreover, my husband's worst fear was looking awkward during our first dance. We were eager to learn and are both physically fit, so Rodolfo was able to help us create a dance that fit our experience level and helped show off our strength with various lifts and dips. He was so thoughtful, he even helped us consider what our outfits would look like and suggested different dancer accessories to help make sure we'd look good. We gave him 2 songs we wanted to dance to and he spend the first 3 lessons teaching us the bachata basics. On our own, we also helped figure out the timing based on his suggestions. With synergy, Rodolfo guided us the whole way. It was such a fun experience and we would always look forward to our weekly lessons - we needed 6 1 hour lessons. Not only did my husband feel confident and impressed that he actually looked coordinated during our dance, but also now we have a lifelong skill of bachata we can use for our whole life as a fun activity to do as a couple. I would wholeheartedly recommend Rodolfo for bachata lessons, wedding first dance choreography, and any other occasion.

t I'd mixed together for a 4-minute dance. Choreography: Ava's custom choreography suited each song really well, and never felt too hard or repetitive. The choreography spanned styles from waltz to bachata and more Broadway-style show dance. The moves were interesting and showy, but still manageable for my (now-)wife and I, who are fairly novice dancers. She even choreographed great transitions between the songs and adjusted moves based on our feedback and how they seemed to work during practice. Teaching: Ava really clearly demonstrated both the lead and follower roles of the choreography. When we ran into trouble, she could always model our moves or act as our partner. I was impressed especially that she was great at modeling what I should do as a leader. She's also a really active watcher as we went through the choreography, giving specific feedback really clearly. Communication/scheduling: Ava pre-scheduled our dances a few week in advance. She was always flexible with scheduling, and was very on-time. She also made sure to find a large space so we could simulate our dance in a more wedding-venue like space for the last few weeks. Overall, Ava really went above and beyond, and we were very impressed with her work choreographing, teaching, and guiding us through the dance! It turned out really great, and I honestly think my memory of doing the dance (and preparing the dance with Ava's help) is one of the best parts of my process preparing for the wedding.

u had your first lesson with me I was a bit nervous as to what we would be able to accomplish as I didn't know all of your music choices, but as we worked together, I got to see what you two could do, and you both put in the extra time and work to make it happen. You both impressed me with your focus, and with your support of each other in learning the dance. Thank you so much for your review of your lessons with me, I'm glad I was able to help create some happy memories for you. Wishing you both the BEST! Ava

Planning for a first dance is nerve-wracking, especially when neither person in the couple knows what they're doing. That was the exact situation my husband and I found ourselves i...

n before we met Ava. However, she swiftly righted our ship and we had a first dance to remember! We completed five sessions with her and each were magnificent. She brought creativity, fun, and an attention to detail into every session that not only left us feeling more capable, but reassured that we'd be able to make this work. Our gratitude can't fully be expressed the care she exuded for formulating our special moment with us, and we know she'll continue to have that same impact on more couples.

Ava and Rodolfo are incredible Salsa instructors! We worked with them over the course of a few months to improve our salsa skills and choreograph a custom routine for our wedding. ...

We came to them with basic salsa experience (no dance background) and they were able to help us put together the wedding dance of our dreams! Rodolfo was instrumental in creating our surprise wedding dance. We picked out a song and he built us a custom routine around it. He even edited the music so we could do a 2.5 min song (vs the full one) which is exactly what we wanted. Rodolfo was fantastic at building choreography that matched the music perfectly and aligned with our skill set. Rodolfo was always so encouraging, positive, and patient with us. We loved how he would adjust things throughout our lessons too - if he thought something could be improved he would work that in. It was very clear he is passionate about his work and wants the best for the people he works with. Ava was also a blast to work with. She helped to substantially improve our salsa basics and gave us a great library of moves that we then used in our final dance. Ava is very good at identifying how to tweak things to improve the overall flow/look of the moves. Ava is also incredibly kind - at one point she was kind enough to lend me some outfits/jewelry for our special wedding dance. Ava is your go-to if you want someone who is an absolute salsa maven. We really loved working with Ava and Rodolfo. They are so passionate about salsa which makes it so much more fun! We learned so much over this past year and are looking forward to going to more group classes with them.

We simply propped a computer up high and angled the screen down so she could see us and our feet. We even recorded the last session, so we could practice the moves a couple more times in those final days. Of course we expected to have lessons in person, in a studio, but nothing went as expected last year (wedding included) and we wouldn't have wanted it any other way! Ava was great, thank you so much. I even nailed the dip! ...well, kinda - but I didn't drop her :)

rforming for the first time in front of all our guests was daunting. I knew of Ava Apple from all her years in the Bay Area dance scene and I hoped she would be willing to choreograph for us. Turns out she specializes in "first dance" choreography much to my pleasant surprise! Not only was she able to teach my husband to dance, but she taught him how to confidently take the lead as my partner. It was amazing for me to see his dance skills and confidence in choreography blooming, which really made him feel good by the way!! She choreographed at our level, and within our short two-month time frame for rehearsing. Watching the various videos that our guests took of our dance, I can see how everyone is practically mesmerized; no one is eating or talking, they are watching and loving our dance. People were cheering and clapping during all our spins and poses, and our "hammer lock" and finale were a huge hit with the crowd. It was exactly the special moment I had hoped it would be. My husband's dad even commented on it in his speech, that he had no idea his son could dance like that! Thank you Ava for all your patience, you ensured we would get our unforgettable dance!

& Rodolfo to help us create a memorable dance routine for our big day. We LOVE their dance style, clear communication and creativity when it comes to choreography. In our case, they even helped us to come up with some cool lift and tricks –– patiently walking us through technique, styling and posture. At the end of each class, the instructors recorded portions of the routine learned on that specific day so that my partner and I could continue practicing at home. Ava & Rodolfo both are very punctual instructors, which we appreciated, and were very flexible with our busy schedules. I also like the studio location, which is just a couple minutes walk from the 16th and Mission BART station in San Francisco. I loved working with these instructors and highly recommend their lessons for beginners through advanced dancers who, like me and my husband, desire to shine on their big day!
