Many people do a rehearsal before the wedding so they can get hitched without a hitch. Following this, couples have dinner with their VIPs so they can spend more time with them. But no matter if the dinner is casual or formal, you'll need to determine your rehearsal dinner invitation wording and send out invitations. Learn the proper verbiage for [rehearsal dinner](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-rehearsal-basics) invitations, what your paper options are and more with our expert help. And don't worry, it's not complicated.

## Rehearsal Dinner Invitation Wording Basics

There are some essential details you need to know before sending your [rehearsal dinner invitations](https://www.theknot.com/content/rehearsal-dinner-invitation-ideas). Consider the following tips as a starting point. 

[READ MORE Shop Custom Rehearsal Dinner Invitations for Your Vibe ](https://www.theknot.com/paper/invitations/rehearsal-dinner)

  * **Decide whose name goes first:** Traditionally, for couples composed of a bride and groom, the bride-to-be's name is written before the groom-to-be's name. That doesn't mean you have to follow suit. Arrange the names however you like, whether it be by alphabetical order or age. 
  * **Choose the formality:** Since this type of stationery is typically less formal, your rehearsal dinner invitation language be casual and playful. If you'd like to have a formal affair, the invitation's text will have to match. 
  * **Be concise:** "The wording for a rehearsal dinner invitation is more short and to the point than that of a wedding invitation," says stationery expert Le'Trice Penn of [Lepenn Designs](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/lepenn-designs-llc-southfield-mi-157026). That said, try to not add too much copy to your invitation. Instead, include the couple's [wedding website](https://www.theknot.com/gs/wedding-websites) so [rehearsal dinner guests](https://www.theknot.com/content/who-should-be-invited-to-rehearsal-dinner) can get more details, like information about [venue accessibility](https://www.theknot.com/content/accessible-wedding) or the [dress code](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-guest-attire-cheat-sheet). 
  * **Include important information:** You'll need to add the couple's names (first names are usually fine, but for formal events, use full names), rehearsal dinner date, time, location (venue name with city and state or full address), wedding website and hosts' names. Some invitations also include particulars about the wedding ceremony rehearsal itself if only your VIPs will be in attendance.



## Rehearsal Dinner Invite Methods

There are a few ways your rehearsal dinner invitations can look like. Keep reading to see what your options are. (**_Psst:_** Check out more [rehearsal dinner invitation etiquette](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-rehearsals-etiquette#rehearsal-dinner-invitation-etiquette) here.)

### 1\. Wedding Invitation Rehearsal Dinner Insert Card

![Wedding invitation rehearsal dinner insert card from The Knot Invitations](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/278c1f81-0552-4f6e-814b-5af918ff008e~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1200.1200)

_[Photo: The Knot Invitations](https://www.theknot.com/paper/product/modern-palm-wedding-enclosure-cards)_

Penn says rehearsal dinner invitations are more commonly included with the wedding invitation as an insert or [wedding details card](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-details-card). "It's easier for the couple to have a smaller number of these inserts printed and only include it in the invitations of the guests who are specifically invited to attend," she adds. And if you're wondering if the two invitations should have the same design, the answer is that it depends. Here's how we see it: If your rehearsal dinner invites will be an insert in your wedding invitation suite, then it should match the look and feel of your wedding invites (which you can do with [The Knot Invitations](https://www.theknot.com/paper).) However, if you're sending your rehearsal dinner invites separately, they should match the vibe of your event. So if you're planning a down-home backyard gathering, get [BBQ rehearsal dinner invitations](https://www.theknot.com/content/bbq-rehearsal-dinner-invitations).

### 2\. Paper Rehearsal Dinner Invitations

_[Photo: The Knot Invitations](https://www.theknot.com/paper/product/til-death-do-we-disco-rehearsal-dinner-invitations)_

If your rehearsal dinner guest list is quite different from your wedding guest list, consider sending the rehearsal dinner invites separately. If this is the case for you, consider sending paper or digital invitations. (We'll discuss the latter one momentarily.) "Couples traditionally do, and should, send some form of a printed rehearsal dinner invitation," says Penn. "The rehearsal dinner is one of the most important wedding events, whether it's designed to be formal or more casual, and should be treated as such," she adds.

### Find your kind of venue

From barns to ballrooms, discover reception venues that feel like you.

### 3\. Digital Rehearsal Dinner Invitations

While paper invitations are pretty standard, if your budget doesn't allow for the extra printed materials, digital or email rehearsal dinner invitations are acceptable. But even though digital rehearsal dinner invitations are more affordable and sustainable and can be sent instantly, there are some cons to going this route. Some guests believe that a digital invitation look takes away from the informality of the event and isn't as accessible, while couples have trouble with finding diverse designs and have to worry about collecting everyone's email address. No matter which way you send your invitations, base your decision on what's best for your situation.

## How to Address Rehearsal Dinner Invitations

When it comes to [how to address invitation envelopes](https://www.theknot.com/content/addressing-wedding-invitations), there are some etiquette rules to follow. This step is necessary if you're sending your rehearsal dinner invitations separately from the wedding invites. You'll need to add the full name of the couple or single person along with proper titles, while for a family you'll only do this for the heads of the household. But if you'd like to be more casual, just first and last names without titles like Mr., Mrs. or [Mx.](https://www.theknot.com/content/what-does-mx-stand-for) works too. Also, be clear about who's invited. Only say "The Shelton Family" if everyone in that household (including kids) are invited. Otherwise, say "Blake and Sandy Shelton." If you're [addressing a plus-one](https://www.theknot.com/content/do-spouses-attend-wedding-rehearsal-dinner), try to find out that person's name so you can include it on the invitation.

## Rehearsal Dinner RSVPs

While wedding invitations typically include separate [RSVP cards](https://www.theknot.com/paper/rsvp-cards), rehearsal dinner RSVPs are handled much more informally. According to Penn, "RSVPs for the rehearsal dinner may be received more casually in the form of an email, phone call or text." It's the responsibility of the host(s) to be the RSVP point person, which means they'll receive the guest responses. On the rehearsal dinner invitation, include your wedding website so the link can lead guests to the RSVP details, such as the point person's phone number and/or email address and the RSVP deadline date.
