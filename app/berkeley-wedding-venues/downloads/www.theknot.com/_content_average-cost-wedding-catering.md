## Average Wedding Catering Cost

So, how much does wedding catering cost? According to internal data, the average cost of wedding catering was $80 per person. There also wasn't a big difference in the average cost of wedding catering between weddings with smaller guests lists and larger ones. 

FEATURED VIDEO FROM THE KNOT

Many couples deem food (and more specifically, professional catering) a worthy expense. Our study found that 58% of couples said food and beverage were the most important wedding elements to them during the wedding planning process (that's why doing a menu tasting is so essential). 72% of married couples mentioned that they wanted their guests to be taken care of and have a good time, so spending more on a memorable food and beverage experience likely helped them achieve that goal.

**Wedding Catering Cost For:**50 Guests | 100 Guests | 150 Guests | 200 Guests




### Average Wedding Catering Cost for 50 Guests

The total price for 50 guests is $4,000. Based on the average wedding food cost, we did simple math. Just multiply $80 (the cost per person) by 50 guests. 

### Average Wedding Catering Cost for 100 Guests

Following the same formula as above, the catering cost for 100 guests is $8,000. It's clear that adding 50 more loved ones can double costs, so it might be wise to have a smaller wedding if you want to cut down on your spending.

### Average Wedding Catering Cost for 150 Guests

The catering cost for 150 wedding guests is $12,000. Typically, to-be-weds who are able to spend this amount on wedding food have a larger budget overall. 

### Average Wedding Catering Cost for 200 Guests

Wedding catering for 200 guests costs $16,000 on average. If you're potentially going to spend this much, look into the price difference of a [family-style wedding dinner](https://www.theknot.com/content/family-style-wedding-dinner) or the savings of choosing a [buffet versus plated meals](https://www.theknot.com/content/costs-for-different-meal-options) so you ensure you're getting the best bang for your buck. 

### Find your kind of venue

From barns to ballrooms, discover reception venues that feel like you.

### What's Included In Wedding Catering Prices?

Food, beverages (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic selections) and waitstaff are customary parts of just about every wedding catering package. But what's required of the waitstaff varies—they can be involved in setting up, tending bar, clearing tables and much more. (All of those service additions can raise the cost.) Whether or not you have menu tastings and a custom or fixed menu impacts the final price as well. Rentals like dinnerware, tables and chairs can be included in the total catering price too. Having staff help with a champagne toast or cake-cutting ceremony are typically add-ons. 

Wondering if [vendor meals](https://www.theknot.com/content/have-to-feed-wedding-vendors) are in catering packages? The answer is yes. Usually, the catering company takes care of its staff, but other on-site vendors like the photographer, videographer and DJ will require a hot meal too. Also, there are some caterers that offer cheaper options for vendor meals so you wouldn't be paying the same price per head as the guest meals. 

Even though 63% of couples said that price was the most important factor when deciding which caterer to contact, remember the value of booking a good caterer who understands what you want out of your wedding food and beverage experience. So when you bring your [questions for the wedding caterer](https://www.theknot.com/content/questions-to-ask-your-wedding-caterer) to the consultation, be as thorough as possible. That way, you'll be on the same page once the package is finalized.

## Wedding Catering Cost Factors

The typical wedding catering cost varies widely across the country. Nicole Hamby, vice president of national sales at[ Elior North America](https://www.elior-na.com/) and[ Constellation Culinary Group](https://constellationculinary.com/), says you should think of wedding catering like planning a dinner party for a lot of people, and that there are numerous elements that impact catering rates per person. "The menu and service style matter—a nicer plated dinner with steak and lobster costs way more than a fun thematic buffet. And don't forget location. Big-city weddings or remote venues can add costs for staffing, rentals and transportation," Hamby, who excels at making every event a gastronomic success, says. Read below to see what eight aspects typically affect the wedding catering bill.

What's the price of a slice?  ](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-much-do-wedding-cakes-cost)

### Hometown vs. Destination

Couples tend to spend more on catering per guest if they're hosting a domestic or international destination wedding versus a hometown event. For domestic destination weddings, the average catering price was $104 per person, while for international destination celebrations, it was $114. Those who had hometown weddings spent $79 per person. 

### Guests With Restrictive Diets

More and more to-be-weds are leaning into making their menus inclusive, with 58% of those surveyed saying they accommodated guests with specific dietary needs. This involves everything from gluten-free desserts to entire [vegan wedding menus](https://www.theknot.com/content/vegan-food-ideas).

### The Sweet Stuff

In 2024, desserts were _in_ (and let's hope that continues). According to our study, 66% of couples provided guests with a dessert other than wedding cake, and 52% had an entire bar or table devoted to sweet treats—a subtle increase from previous years. Think: cookies, pies, candy, s'mores and much more. If you want to wow your guests with a showstopping dessert table, factor that cost into your overall food budget.

### Interactive Food Experiences

13% of couples had an interactive food experience, like a station where guests can get creative with tasty [taco bar ideas](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-taco-bar) the couple thought up, for example, and 4% had a food truck. All of these Insta-worthy installments affect the price of your wedding food—and thus the national average catering cost per person for a wedding.

### Locally Sourced Products

Almost one out of four couples (22%) reported incorporating locally sourced products. This includes serving local craft beer and produce or getting regional [oysters for your wedding](https://www.theknot.com/content/oyster-shucker-wedding/). Not only is it a great way to pay homage to your wedding's location, but you'll also [make your wedding more eco-friendly](https://www.theknot.com/content/eco-friendly-wedding-guide) since going local lowers your carbon emission output.

### Incorporating Food Based on One's Background or Culture

Couples also incorporated their backgrounds into their wedding menus, with 15% honoring their hometowns or their respective cultures through the dishes served. Our respondents reported serving everything from samosas to Philly cheesesteaks.

### Late-Night Snacks

Late-night grub was popular last year, as 27% of couples served [late-night snacks](https://www.theknot.com/content/which-late-night-snack-should-you-serve-at-wedding)—one of the most popular [wedding food trends](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-food-trends) recently. And we guarantee that if you decide to have an after-party, your guests will love this surprise. Options can include anything from mini burgers to chicken and waffles.

### Catering Rentals

Rentals like linens, cutlery sets and dishes may bring the overall price of wedding catering up. That's why you should talk to your vendor about their wedding catering packages (with prices) and what's included in each. [Factor in the gratuity](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-vendor-tipping-cheat-sheet) so you have a clear idea of how much your wedding catering will cost.

![Couple talking with caterer](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/0d886ad3-e32a-45d2-ab52-8289df819354~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1509.1132)

## How to Request Catering Quotes for Weddings

Once you find a couple of caterers you like on [The Knot Vendor Marketplace](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/catering), you can message them directly to request a quote. Hamby tells us the top-four things to keep in mind during this process: 

  1. Include your date, guest count and venue.
  2. Think about the experience. Do you want plated service or want some [wedding buffet ideas](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-buffet-menu-ideas)? How about late-night snacks? (Spoiler: You're going to want late-night snacks.)
  3. Find the right fit for you by checking out menus, reading reviews and asking specific questions about packages. This means you need to get all the details, like if rentals or cake cutting is included.
  4. Book ASAP. Good caterers get scooped up fast so you need to be confident in what and who you want. 



You should also give your desired vendor an idea of your catering budget so they can send you a comprehensive response about their prices and packages.

Don't know what you should look for when you receive a wedding catering quote? Here are certain things you should see: an estimate for each entree item, appetizer, dessert and drink, cost of rentals, labor, travel, set up, breakdown and cake-cutting fees and finally, the tax. How the quote is listed will vary between caterers, but above is what you'll typically find on one. Once you get some quotes back, use our [free budget tool](https://www.theknot.com/wedding-budget) to compare those numbers to the pricing estimates for vendors in your wedding location. Then, you'll know if you can increase how much you're allocating to catering or if you need to check out [wedding food ideas on a budget](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-to-save-on-catering).

## How Much Have Typical Wedding Catering Costs Changed Over the Years?

The average catering cost for a wedding decreased from $85 per person to $80 per person from 2023 and 2024. In 2022 and 2021, the price per head was $75 and, in 2019, the average cost was $70. Hamby answers [why weddings are so expensive](https://www.theknot.com/content/why-are-weddings-so-expensive) by explaining the causes of the fluctuating numbers: "Catering prices have gone up (thanks, inflation), but couples are also splurging more on experiences—think interactive food stations, micro-opulent moments and family-style everything. Plus, rising food and labor costs mean even a simple wedding meal isn't as cost effective as it used to be." Your best bet is to be as flexible as possible with your wedding menu and trust in your caterer to ensure your event runs smoothly. Doing so will result in tastier food for you and your guests and less stress on your wallet.
