Updated Jan 10, 2025

Wedding registries have come a long way since the days of toting a handheld barcode scanner around your local Macy's. Yes, a few couples are still registering for traditional trappings like formal wedding china (11% in 2024, according to The Knot Registry Study), but modern wedding registry trends have shifted toward functionality and personalization, not quite in the sense of monogrammed linens, but more about making a registry that's hyperspecific to you—traditional template be damned. And that's a good thing. In 2025, couples will want their wedding registries to reflect their goals and needs more than ever, and will be on the hunt for registry services that offer flexibility. [The Knot Registry](https://www.theknot.com/registry), for example, can combine items from anywhere into one seamless wish list (including those from our bigwig registry partners like CB2 and Anthropologie, so you won't have to worry too much about [where to register for a wedding](https://www.theknot.com/content/complete-registry-store-guide)). What's more, it also offers the functionality to register for gift cards and start cash funds for everything from a honeymoon to a future home.

## 1\. Honeymoon Must-Haves 

![Large hard-case suitcases](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/af3f9af5-1bc9-4130-aafe-6d9a7f9891bd~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.765.765)

Wedding registries traditionally cover all things domestic, but 2025 couples are setting their sights abroad as they assemble their wish lists. Sam Kaplan, senior manager of registry at The Knot, says that honeymoon experiences and stylish travel gear will be mainstays this year. 

"Couples are prioritizing unforgettable experiences, and registries are reflecting this trend," says the expert. Items that might appear on the [wedding registry checklist](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-registry-checklist-essentials) of a 2025 couple include: airline and hotel [gift cards](https://www.theknot.com/registry/store/categories/gift-cards-and-experiences/gift-cards/travel); [honeymoon experiences](https://www.theknot.com/registry/store/categories/gift-cards-and-experiences/experiences) like outdoor excursions, cooking classes and guided tours; stylish passport holders and packing cubes. Not to mention [durable luggage](https://www.theknot.com/registry/store/categories/lifestyle/luggage) that makes all the difference when maneuvering through airports, train stations or Europe's cobblestone streets. According to The Knot Registry Study, 22% of couples registered for luggage and travel goodies in 2024, and that number will likely continue to grow.

## 2\. Practical Picks for Entertaining 

![Yellow dining set](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/d209b67f-d136-441b-ab41-58b4cdb4ea1d~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.765.765)

_[Photo: Gibson](https://www.theknot.com/registry/store/products/zuma-16-piece-stoneware-kitchen-dinnerware-set-1?id=245859)_

It's been the year of the dinner party, so it's no surprise that engaged couples are excited about cozy meals at home. And while a pretty plate or fancy cloth napkin does go a long way, couples want to ensure their pieces are also durable and low-maintenance. 

"Practicality will continue to be a key consideration for couples when choosing their collections," says Federika Longinotti-Buitoni, founder of [Collecto](https://www.collectoworld.com/), a luxury wedding registry service and retailer. She notes that "dishwasher-safe tableware and machine-washable linens that balance style with effortlessness" will grace many couples' wish lists. Plus, easier maintenance means more parties with less elbow grease afterward.

## 3\. Ways to Preserve Wedding Heirlooms

_[Photo: Pressed Floral](https://www.theknot.com/registry/store/products/preserved-bouquet-gift-card-1?id=197272)_

"Couples are looking for ways to preserve and celebrate their wedding and honeymoon memories," says Kaplan—and this is extending to their wedding registries. This is one of our favorite new wedding registry trends for 2025 (and one of the [best wedding registry ideas](https://www.theknot.com/content/best-wedding-registry-ideas) for sentimental couples), coming in tandem with the wave of nostalgia permeating other aspects of the wedding industry. Photo framing services like [Frameology](https://www.theknot.com/registry/store/brands/frameology) will remain popular as well as purveyors like [Artifact Uprising](https://www.theknot.com/registry/store/brands/artifact-uprising), where couples can put together an heirloom-worthy wedding album. Additionally, requests for wedding dress or wedding bouquet preservation services (like [Unbox the Dress](https://www.theknot.com/registry/store/brands/unbox-the-dress) and [Pressed Floral](https://www.theknot.com/registry/store/brands/pressed-floral)) will gain traction. 

## 4\. Elevated Tablescape Pieces

Dinnerware and serveware will always have a place on wedding registries, but 2025 will see a shift in focus to the other elements that make up a perfectly set table. Specifically, there will be an emphasis on decor pieces that set the mood and aesthetic of an evening.

"We anticipate a continued focus on tableware, with couples incorporating curated accessories such as Murano glass vases, brass candleholders and wooden salt and pepper shakers to give their tables an extra touch of chic," says Longinotti-Buitoni. 

## 5\. Quality Kitchenware Upgrades

![Sage green cooking pot with lid](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/72feda9a-7d40-43e9-b88f-f78ad70bca1a~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.765.765)

_[Photo: Caraway](https://www.theknot.com/registry/store/products/non-stick-ceramic-saucepan?id=251635)_

"Couples are opting for versatile, high-quality items that blend seamlessly into their homes and stand the test of time," says Kaplan. "Quality cookware continues to be a top priority for our couples, and this trend is only gaining momentum."

Kaplan mentions that [Caraway](https://www.theknot.com/registry/store/brands/caraway) will be a coveted cookware brand for eco-minded couples (and those who can't resist a colorful kitchen piece), while chef-favorite brand All-Clad will entice pairs looking to invest in a restaurant-level set of pots and pans. Kaplan also notes: "Beyond cookware, couples are opting for other high-quality kitchen staples, such as professional-grade knife sets from [Zwilling J.A. Henckels](https://www.theknot.com/registry/store/brands/zwilling-ja-henckels)."

## 6\. Embroidered Table Linens

![Embroidered table linens with cutlery](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/207531df-ddd6-4383-832a-5f0c67556d20~rs_768.h-cr_256.0.1792.2048)

_[Photo: Courtesy of Collecto](https://www.collectoworld.com/collections/table-linens/products/cosmo-olive-rectangular-tablecloth)_

Embroidered table linens have evolved from the whimsical place setting tablecloths we saw in early 2023 to a staple of elevated entertaining. Cheeky embroidered cocktail napkins, placemats, coasters and dinner napkins adorned with some thoughtfully placed thread will be trending on registries in 2025. 

"Embroidered linens are becoming a sought-after addition, offering a touch of understated elegance to a tablescape," says Longinotti-Buitoni. "I personally love Spanish-based Los Encajeros—it holds a special place in my heart as one of the first brands to support us."

## 7\. Mixing Tangible and Non-Tangible Gifts 

![Woman ziplining in a forest](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/551263e8-09b4-4a49-8571-fc5f48aef2d2~rs_768.h-cr_0.182.765.756)

_[Photo: Virgin Experiences](https://www.theknot.com/registry/store/products/zipline-canopy-adventure-1?id=183671)_

"Couples are becoming increasingly mindful of the costs associated with their wedding and are ensuring their registries include options for every guest's budget," says Kaplan. "Many are combining traditional gifts with [cash funds](https://www.theknot.com/content/cash-registry-the-newlywed-fund), charity donations and experience-based gifts, offering a variety of ways for guests to contribute meaningfully, regardless of their financial situations."

Additionally, this trending approach allows a couple to have flexibility to [create a registry](https://www.theknot.com/content/the-knot-registry-placing-an-order) that reflects their aspirations to a T. Because why not create a registry cash fund for a house down payment while simultaneously curating items for said house? 

## 8\. Playful Patterned China 

![Summer tablescape beside a pool](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/02ed4f7d-3d46-4268-8261-89f5461b36b5~rs_768.h-cr_166.0.2834.2001)

_[Photo: Courtesy of Collecto](https://www.collectoworld.com/)_

"In 2025, we see couples embracing more playful, personality-driven choices for their registries, and vibrant printed dinnerware sets are becoming a standout trend," says Longinotti-Buitoni. "While formal dinnerware remains a staple (think: gold rims and timeless patterns), many couples are curating second or even third sets for casual gatherings with friends, celebrating color and distinctiveness."

According to the pro, brands like Laboratorio Paravicini and Johanna Ortiz are capturing couples' attention over at Collecto, as both offer impeccable designs that blend traditional craftsmanship with bold aesthetics.

## 9\. Eco-Friendly Items

![Cozy cream and burnt orange bed linens](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/47f7dd94-0332-4601-98c8-787d15e68a62~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.768.768)

_[Photo: Parachute](https://www.theknot.com/registry/store/products/linen-box-quilted-sham-set-1?id=244255)_

Last year, it became increasingly important for every aspect of a wedding to reflect the couple's values, including their gift wish list. Sustainability-minded couples have been consciously choosing eco-friendly brands to register for since last year, and the trend shows no signs of slowing down. 

"A growing focus on sustainability has led to a preference for materials like wood, stone, ceramic and linen," says Kaplan. "The demand for non-toxic, eco-friendly cookware also continues to grow as couples prioritize health and sustainability."

## 10\. Private Registry Consultations

![Couple talking to a wedding planner](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/89241f55-35b6-4db2-a979-8991bcf4bf9d~rs_768.h-cr_54.0.1594.1155)

"We're seeing a rise in our bespoke registry consultations," says Longinotti-Buitoni. "With endless options to choose from, couples are turning to our guidance to ensure their registry feels thoughtful and tailored to their lifestyle."

If consulting with a registry pro isn't quite in your wedding budget, take a look at [The Knot Registry Awards](https://www.theknot.com/content/registry-awards) to view a collection of registry gifts backed by our expert team as you curate your wish list.
