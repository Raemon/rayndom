Had a great experience from start to finish! I live in Walnut Creek for work and my fiancé(now husband) lives in SO Cal and mo family in Texas. I went to try on dresses by myself a...

nd really enjoyed the experience. I had no idea what I wanted to wear and the second dress I tried on was the one! My husband loved the way it looked on me when I walked down the aisle and I had so many compliments! The service was great and I couldn’t have asked for anything better!

I am not your typical bride... I never planned how my wedding dress would look until it became an option after becoming engaged! La Soie Bridal was not the initial bridal gown stor...

e I was planning to go to but with the first closed and the second down the street from them super packed and busy I found myself here where I stumbled upon Olivia who not only helped me make the appointment she found exactly what i was looking for, within my budget, was there for every visit after for fittings and was there to wish me well upon pick up the day before our wedding. I went to another store after seeing the dress to see if I had cheaper options... the other stores didn't understand what I wanted, nor did they try. Olivia got it within the first three dresses. Granted it was at the top of the budget I gave her and I was already stretching it there but it was exactly what I wanted. Its kinda strange to say this but I felt Olivia isn't just there to sell you a dress but she connects with you and finds you your dress cause she actually cares! They also sewed in the sash I made from home so that it would stay in place...and that's after already having to do a lot since I'm a petite curvy girl! I could not have been happier with my experience here! Thank you so much for helping ease my stress when picking out my dress, it was extremely easy with you all involved!

I was unable to wear my dress on my wedding day because the seamstress made my dress too tight. At the fitting, you only have the dress on for 20-30 minutes. On my wedding day when...

I wore the dress for a longer period of time, I felt like I was going to pass out. I was late to my ceremony and missed hours of my reception. Worst of all is Olivia's response when I told her what happened. She is unprofessional, rude, and lacks any empathy. The worst costumer service I have ever experienced. If I could do it all over again, I would stay far away from La Soie.

I had the most wonderful experience shopping at La Soie. Patti was knowledgeable, kind and understanding. She made me feel confident and special on such an important day. Shopping ...

for a dress can be so stressful; however, the calm, clean and intimate environment at La Soie made the experience very enjoyable. If you are shopping for a dress in the Bay Area, La Soie is a must.

I loved the dress I found at La Soie in Walnut Creek. The salespeople were great when I tried on dresses & I even received a handwritten card after my visit! However, the team neve...

r got the memo that I was the person to contact about my own wedding dress instead of my MOH (who made the initial consultation appointment), with the result that my dress was in for almost a month before I found out about it. Additionally, the fittings were a PAIN - they are only done on Wednesdays & the latest appointment is at 5 PM, meaning I had to leave SF at 3:30 at the latest & pray that BART was running on time. Not convenient at all for a working bride! However, the fittings were worth it in the end because the seamstress that does the alterations really knows each dress. She knew exactly where to alter the dress & hand-dismantled the lace overlay & put it back together - definitely worth the timing hassle in the end since the dress fit me perfectly!

I LOVED my dress, it was perfect and fit to the stitch (thanks to the incredible seamstress at the Walnut Creek location). The gals were always so friendly and willing to help acco...

mmodate me, even if it was to stay late so I can make a dress fitting after work. I really enjoyed my experience, as the Walnut Creek store made everything easy for me--and it was basically a one stop shop for most of my wedding day attire. I certainly recommend! :)
