PetitAmour Flower is a boutique floral design house dedicated to bespoke wedding florals — created for The Best Moment of a life shared. Based in San Francisco, San Jose, Saratoga, and Napa, with an expanded presence in Pleasanton and the Tri-Valley beginning in 2026, we also accept a limited number of destination weddings each year. For Southern California destinations such as Los Angeles, as well as Hawaii, no separate destination fee is applied. Only standard delivery and logistics costs are considered. Our work begins long before the wedding day. Flowers are not selected from presets or seasonal formulas; they are shaped through sustained dialogue, trust, and time. We design by listening — allowing each celebration to unfold with clarity, restraint, and intention. Every composition is created exclusively for one couple. Bouquets, ceremony installations, and reception florals are conceived from the ground up, guided by personal sensibility, spatial context, and emotional balance. Nothing is reused. Nothing is repeated. Our aesthetic is informed by formal floral studies and professional experience across Asia and Europe, where proportion, material integrity, and quiet restraint define true luxury. The result is floral work that feels composed and enduring — expressive without excess, memorable without spectacle. Throughout the planning process, we remain closely involved, offering discernment rather than direction. This continuity allows florals to become part of the wedding’s atmosphere and memory — not decoration, but meaning. Our recent work and ongoing floral stories can be found on Instagram: @petitamourflower

Every couple has a different story—and we believe their flowers should reflect that. At Petit Amour Flower, we specialize in fully custom floral design that celebrates each client’s style, emotion, and vision. From the very first consultation, we take the time to understand what matters most to you, then translate that into timeless floral moments—designed from scratch, never repeated. Our work is rooted in intentionality and beauty, shaped by global design training across Asia and Europe. We proudly serve weddings throughout the Bay Area—including Saratoga, San Jose, San Francisco, and Napa—as well as select destination locations like Los Angeles, Hawaii, and beyond. Whether your celebration is in your hometown or across the ocean, we’re here to craft florals that are as meaningful and one-of-a-kind as your love.

Thank you so much for your heartfelt words. Planning a destination wedding all the way fr...

om Germany must have come with extra challenges, and yet every conversation with you was full of warmth, trust, and joy. It was such a privilege to design your flowers and bring beauty to a day surrounded by guests who traveled from Germany, Korea, Florida, Canada, and Costa Rica — all to celebrate your love. Knowing that our designs became part of your happiest memories means the world to me. Wishing you both endless happiness and good health always.

I got married June 2025, and I was in touch with Petitamour starting summer 2024. PA checked in with me throughout the year to make sure she understood my vision with my wedding fl...

orals. I did change my whole vision board as I got closer to the wedding, but PA continued to be flexible and helped through looking into more specific examples and designs to make my dream wedding floral come true. She stayed professional at all times. I cannot recommend PA enough to anyone looking to have a beautiful wedding.
