Do not trust the posted hours of operation - this store is rarely, if ever, open. After years of walking past this lovely store and window shopping, I had high expectations. Unfor...

tunately, Bride & Bustle proved to be a frustrating disappointment at just about every step of the way. During my dress appointment, several of the accesories we looked at to buy were either damaged or out of stock, but still on display. When attempting to pick up my dress, on multiple occasions, the store was closed - even after we had communicated with staff and received confirmation that it would, indeed, be open to pick up the dress that I ordered. They forgot to place the order for the accessories I purchased. When the accessories arrived and we arranged a pickup time, the store was closed. When we finally received the accessories, the necklace was damaged. They were able to fix the necklace, but it was more obstacles, back and forth emails, frustration than I ever expected to simply pick up the dress and accessories that I had purchased.

Really disappointing. I anticipated the charge for the appointment would go toward the service and the experience. Sadly it definitely did not. The staff was rude and unhelpful. Th...

ey didn't offer us any help on picking out a dress or even offer beverages when it was 80+ degrees outside. The saleswoman kept reminding me of the time I had left on the appointment. The dresses were stained (one dress had coffee spilled on it), old, and torn. It was easily the worst experience I've ever had trying on wedding dresses. The only redeeming quality was that it was well-stocked and had several nice brands, but the attitudes of the sales associates were such that I would rather buy the dresses I liked at another shop. I will not be returning and will tell all my engaged friends never to go here.

The staff was very friendly but, unfortunately wasn't helpful when it came to finding a wedding dress. I was new to dress shopping so it would have been extremely helpful to get an...

understanding of the types of styles available and also suggestions from the bridal consultant on what she thought would be flattering for my body type instead of being told to just pick stuff out. I mention this because the dress I ultimately chose was one that was suggested by a bridal consultant (at a different shop) and was a style that I never thought would look good on me but turned out to be perfect. I was also confused as to why the consultant asked to see pictures of dresses I found online that I liked if she didn’t plan on helping me find something similar. I tried on about 6 dresses but many of them either had big stains on the front or very noticeable rips in the fabric which didn’t help the overall experience. They also had a very small number of dresses to choose from compared to other bridal shops I visited.

Bride and Bustle was my final destination for dress shopping and I found my stunning dress here! We’d had a couple of lackluster appointments trying on dresses before - walking int...

o this shop was a totally different experience! I could browse through the dresses instead of just hoping they were bringing out things I’d want to try on, unlike some other shops we went to. My stylist also paid attention to things I liked and didn’t like, and made recommendations to help me find a dress I loved wearing but probably wouldn’t have considered on the rack. The dress I ended up loving was gorgeous, but had a super low plunging neckline on the sample - that would have been a deal breaker but they were able to offer customization options through the designer and worked with them to confirm how I wanted the adjusted neckline to look and how high to raise it. It was so worth the customization fee to create my dream dress! They have beautiful accessories there, so I got to try it on with different veils and jewelry to create the whole look. I also worked with one of their recommended tailors and she was amazing! The dress I ordered was already a much closer fit than the sample, but by the time she worked her magic, it felt like it was made for me! I loved wearing my dress from Bride and Bustle and I got so many compliments - it was truly my dream dress!

ng all my favorite songs when I was trying on dresses. I didn't think I had much of a vision in mind before shopping, but I knew I always loved Hayley Paige dresses. Before my appointment, I was able to see if they could pull a few styles for me, and then they searched for a few more that followed the same vibes. I ended up trying on about 10 dresses but happened to fall head over heels for the first one I tried on and nothing else could compare. Trying on wedding dresses can seem overwhelming or stressful, but I had so much fun shopping at Haute Bride!

The timing estimate and communication was top notch throughout the whole process (which, for a nervous bride-to-be, is key!). They sized me in store and when the dress arrived, it fit like a glove! I only had to alter the length. I can't thank the Haute Bride team enough for making me feel stunning on my special day.

rking with numerous people throughout my wedding (dress, jewelry, preservation, etc.) and you can tell they all really care for each of their brides and make the whole experience easy and fun! The dresses they carry are all gorgeous and each have a touch of uniqueness setting them apart from more basic dresses you can find everywhere else - which also made it so difficult to pick a dress as I wished I could have several dresses on my wedding day since there were so many beautiful different styles I loved! They also have many hand made accessories for all of your needs to choose from to complete any look - one of the accessories I selected was a sash and it completely transformed my dress adding a little rustic chic which aligned with our wedding theme! I would highly recommend checking out their selection as you won't be disappointed!

d, "My wedding dress is coming from this shop." The day finally came in March of 2018 when I became engaged and it was time to shop. I emailed for an appointment when my friends/family could come with me. I became impatient and went shopping around at other stores because time was ticking and I wasn't sure the budget was going to work with Haute Bride and their designers. After a nightmare shopping excursion at a nearby shop, my friend took me crying into Haute Bride and told them I had an appointment for a few weeks but was there any chance they had an opening right then. I believe a newer associate was at the desk and she made it happen. I went through the racks and already my mood was changing. I knew it all along my dress was there and I let myself get too impatient but trying those other stores. I found my dress! It was the third one I tried on there and funny enough, I did not pull that one off the rack. My sales gal did! When I tried it on, I had the moment you don't think will happen. I knew it right away, it was my dress and I was pleasantly surprised that the prices was half of what I though it was going to me. They have nice accessories to try on as well. Don't hesitate to come to this shop, they know what they are doing and do it well.

, and felt like I was with a knowledgeable friend when working with Lindsey. She was sweet, style-centric, and able to address all my questions. It was my favorite salon overall given the friendliness of the staff, the dress selection, and the overall ambiance. The selection of dresses was pretty plentiful, as well as they carry many accessory options. I was able to try on a few different dress styles and expand outside of my initial style. Every dress is gorgeous and in amazing condition. There was no sales pressure and after our appointment, the salon/Lindsey was very responsive to my questions & emails. Set in darling downtown Los Gatos, it’s easy to make a day out of your appointment by visiting the local restaurants or coffee shops. You won’t be rushed, yet I tried on about 5-7 dresses, whereas, at other salons, I got through half as many in the same amount of time. I would definitely recommend booking an appointment if you are in the South Bay.

Haute Bride was one of the first bridal shops I went to for a dress, and they really set the bar high in terms of standards. I went to a few other shops afterwards but their servic...

e and quality wasn't comparable so I ended up going back. They only schedule a couple of appointments at a time so you have someone working with you the entire time you are there. Other places in the area have less staff and try to book too many appointments to make more money, so you end up waiting in between fittings because each stylist is working on 5 people at a time. I have to give a huge shout out to Molly & Julie who are AMAZING! They treated me as if I was their only client while I was there. I told them the style I was looking for, even showed them picture examples, and they picked out a number of options and made some really good suggestions. They also had a really good selection of dresses, and even told me when they were hosting trunk shows, so I ended up getting my dress at a discounted price :) Once my dress came in, I wanted to make some customizations to it but needed extra lace. Molly was awesome and called the designer on the spot to ask them if they could send me more lace. The responded immediately and sent me additional lace for my tailor to use within a week, all for free! Honestly, my experience with Haute Bride could not have gone any better. I loved the staff and the service was top noch. My bridesmaids came with me to my first appointment and some of them have already gone back to look at dresses for their own wedding!

I had a horrible experience with the entitled, snotty sales clerk at Haute Bride. I was so offended, that I walked out and took my $5,000 budget elsewhere.

yed in the store, and it did not. The head piece also took some stretching and adjusting. Which was scary to do given how much we made for it. My earrings arrived to the bridal salon not completely made. They didn't hook the bottom bangle to the top of the earring. All around great costume jewelry that everyone thought was real. However, know that you can get just as great jewelry at Nordstroms for the same price. It did have some great couture designs though.

I purchased a beautiful pair of earrings from Haute Bride for my wedding this past June. There was a small issue with one of the earrings during the wedding and I brought this to ...

the attention of Haute. The Owner instantly offered to replace the earring with the issue - no questions. I think it is amazing in this day and age for a company to stand behind their products and to pay such special attention to their customers. I would recommend Haute's jewelry to brides in the future and may just continue to purchase their products for special occasions for myself since their jewelry is show-stopping!

ve friend turned me on to Haute Bride, and I am so glad she did! Molly was a fantastic consultant; she had me in close to 10 dresses, and even more of the beautiful, handmade sashes. She was so patient while I hemmed and hawed (everything is so beautiful, it's a hard decision!). I had my "Say Yes to the Dress" moment in Hayley Paige's Kira gown, which I wouldn't have tried if not for her encouragement. I came back for a bridal sash and earrings, as well as earrings and a bracelet for my rehearsal dinner. Living in San Francisco, they were so sweet to offer to mail the jewelry to me and save me a trip! I felt so gorgeous on my wedding day! The tears in my husband's eyes said it all.

Not only were you guys always so helpful, everyone was willing to work with us and get everything in with plenty of time to relax before the wedding.

The girls at the salon were incredibly nice and though I had to go to this appointment alone, they made me feel like I was surrounded by girlfriends. They helped order my custom sized dress and shipped it to their store for me to try on again before sending it to my parents in Massachusetts. The store itself was gorgeous and perfect if you are looking for an upscale boutique wedding dress experience.

experience. (As opposed to another popular store in the area in the Pruneyard that shall remain nameless, that feels overly crowded and dumpy inside.) I admit I was hesitant at first because I thought that the dresses would be way out of my price range and perhaps the staff might be used to catering to a "higher-end" clientele than myself, and that I may not have a good experience. But, I am so glad I cam here because my experience was not like that at all, and was nothing but great! I made several visits before making the decision to purchase, and everyone was friendly, helpful, and patient. After ordering, Molly was the best as I made more visits into the store before the dress came in to match my jewelry and veil. They carry really beautiful gowns from a variety of top designers (and one of the only nearby that carries Matthew Christopher.) If you're on your search for a wedding gown, make an appointment, it's worth a visit!

ick out their dresses. I had seen her listen to what the bride wanted and pick out the perfect dresses. She did the same for me. What I love is that she asked for my budget and if I picked out a dress that was outside that number she was sure to let me know and double check that I wanted to try it on. I literally loved EVERY dress I tried on. I placed an order for my dress last week and I cannot wait to wear it on my big day. The shop is adorable, and also has bridal jewelry. I didn't look at the jewelry. I was focused on the dress so I can't speak much about that although I know my friends loved what they ordered.

hade than the one I tried on in the store, which didn't sit well with me at first. They neglected to mention the sample dress in the store was old and that the sun had changed the original color to more of a cream, champagne (which I liked). That would be my only piece of advice to other brides. Make sure you ask about the color of the dress compared to the sample. They are known for their jewelry and accessories and while they're quite expensive, everything is handmade and absolutely gorgeous. They didn't have the exact matching pieces I was looking for so they had a new set made for me and in a short period of time, which I really appreciated. Overall, a really great bridal shop and highly recommended.

with it. I bought a custom-made necklace and earrings for my wedding here. They looked beautiful when I picked them up and tried them on in the store. BUT, one week before my wedding, my friend asked me to try on the necklace for her. Thank goodness she did, because we realized that as soon as I moved around, the necklace flipped over, showing the back of the pendant. I took it back to get it fixed -- which they did, but was a stressful errand to have to run four days before the wedding. Then in the middle of my wedding, right after the 1st dance, my necklace shattered to the ground. The weight of the pendants broke the chain, apparently. Haute Bride reimbursed me but obviously this did not make up for what I was hoping would an heirloom piece breaking, having to spend time at my wedding trying to scoop up the necklace and fix it, and having no necklace to wear for most of my wedding.

found my dress during a trunk show where I got to meet the designer, Hayley Paige. Since I brought my mom and mother-in-law dress shopping she and Lindsie, the salon owner, were like substitute girlfriends giving advice and helping me try on dresses. They were so sweet and it made for such a wonderful experience! When I went back to pick out accessories the stores manager, Molly, was so helpful in finding the perfect hair piece. She even went as far as creating a custom piece with elements from different designs I liked. I could not say one bad thing about any of the employees I encountered there, they were always so courteous! They were very accommodating and kept clear communication throughout my LONG engagement/wedding planning process. I have never felt more beautiful then I did on my wedding day! I also bought my MOH her gift from Haute Bride and can't wait to get more jewelry from their "Cocktail Bling" line in the future! Thanks so much to Lindsie and the rest of the Haute Bride Crew!

I can't begin to tell you what an absolutely amazingggg experience I had shopping at Haute Bride for my wedding dress!!! Finding the perfect wedding dress for me was quite the jour...

ney! I live in Texas and tried on a total of 100 wedding dresses!! Nothing I found here felt totally right. Thankfully I learned about the amazing Matthew Christopher and knew that he was the designer for me!!! I did my research and found an amazing bridal salon in the Bay Area that carried Matthew and had so many amazing designers and incredible jewelry too!! I made an appointment as soon as I knew I was going to be in the Bay Area for Thanksgiving. I felt confident that after visiting Haute Bride, I was going to be able to tell family and friends I found THE ONE!!! Day of Appt, I went into Haute Bride and met the incredibly sweet and understanding Molly!!!! Molly understood everything that I was looking for!!! She knew I liked Matthew and once she knew my style and how things were fitting we were able to narrow the dress down to a couple!! I was only in town for a couple of days so we set another appointment to do a final try on so I could sleep on it and be totally sure about my choice! Molly went above and beyond in so many ways! Once I made my choice on the dress, Molly helped me start considering what type of jewelry would look incredible, we even figured out what type of veil would complete the look!!! Molly did such a great job on measuring me for my dress that I didn't even need to get alterations done on the length!! Working with Haute Bride and Molly, I never once felt any concern about the dress shipping directly to me in Texas. Molly was always on top of everything from start to finish!! Whenever I had a question about anything she would email me or call me! She even reached out to the designer’s POC to answer any specific questions about my dress! She honestly put me at ease through the entire process and gave me the experience that I had always wanted since I starting looking for the dress!! I fell in love with Haute Bride for so many reasons!!! I'm a fashion girl and Cali girl at heart! Haute Bride was able to give me the look I wanted by giving me options I couldn’t find anywhere else! The dresses I tried on at Haute Bride actually felt like dresses that I could wear on a red carpet, which was the exact look I was going for! I highly recommend you check out Haute Bride regardless of where you live!!! It was everything that I ever wanted and more! One more note about Matthew Christopher - He designs his dresses with a woman's figure in mind! My dress came with built in cups and doing custom measurements helped the dress look like Matthew designed it for me himself! Stop reading this review and make an appointment at Haute Bride!!

ful, and never made the bride feel uncomfortable, and there was no pressure to buy at all. They also carry a lot of accessories from belts to jewelry so you can pretty much get everything you need right there. They also use a local seamstress for alterations so you don't need to worry about either. Would highly recommend as a go to place on your list of bridal shops.

While shopping for my wedding dress, I visited a total of four bridal salons and I probably tried on a total of thirty dresses. Haute Bride was the last place I went to and by the ...

time I made my appointment there, I already had a clear idea of what fabric, silhouette and color I was looking for. Plus, I had my eye on a particular Tara Keely dress that as it turned out, Haute Bride was one of just a handful of bridal salons in the Bay Area that carried it. But before I go on about my experience,I must say that they did such a wonderful job with the decor of the space. It's small but they made great use of the space and the fact that it's small makes it feel more private. It truly is beautiful. It all just added to my excitement. My consultant, Mimi, helped me pick out six exquisite dresses which all somehow fit amazingly on me--even the Tara Keely one I had my eye on. However, when you find the one, you just know it's The One and mine ended up being a GORGEOUS Agusta Jones number. I didn't cry or scream--I just felt that it was my dress. From there on out, the staff helped with the process of ordering the dress and making sure it would come on time. They were so great every time I went in for a fitting. It was definitely a pleasant experience and I'm so very thankful that they helped make it that way.

My experience with Haute Bride has been so wonderful, I'm looking for any excuse to keep coming back (renewal of vows, anyone?)! I originally found out about HB through Yelp and...

decided to make an appointment. My bridal consultant, Veronica, was able to book an appointment for me for the following day! Veronica was the perfect sales consultant. She was awesome, patient, knew what I was looking for, and recommended a sexy, unique Matthew Christopher gown that I ended up falling in love with! HB is the only store in the city that carries his gorgeous dresses, so I'm really glad I went to the store. Veronica did not pressure me to buy that day, which I really appreciated, as I did not want to make the decision so soon. I returned a couple days later, after checking out a Priscilla of Boston sample sale, certain that I would not find anything like the Matthew Christopher dress! The dress was amazing, as was my experience with Veronica! I should say that I also liked a few other dresses they carry by designers Mikaella and Modern Trousseau. I also wanted a custom couture necklace made and had an amazing experience working with Lindsie, the store owner and jewelry designer of Haute Bride. The necklace turned out beautifully and I cannot wait to wear it again and again! It is stunning. In fact, all of the bridal jewelry looks amazing and the store sells beautiful cocktail jewelry as well. I've been back to the store several times, to look at veils, buy my bridal earrings etc. and I've always felt welcomed! Even when there was a small issue, Lindsie more than made up for it and showed what a true professional and wonderful person she is. She went above and beyond and provided exceptional service. I highly recommend Haute Bride to any bride, bridesmaid or woman who is looking for unique, sparkly jewels!
