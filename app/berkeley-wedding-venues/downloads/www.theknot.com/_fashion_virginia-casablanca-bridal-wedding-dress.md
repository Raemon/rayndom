Description

Art Deco meets luxury bridal fashion in style 2560 Virginia. Certain to leave you feeling like Hollywood royalty, this sparkling gem from the Fall '24 collection is crafted with luxurious satin lining and embellished with floral lace adorned with glistening sequins & beads. In the front, her V-neckline is supported by delicate, yet durable spaghetti straps. Her 15-point boned bodice features our signature hourglass, contoured lining and gives way to a sheath silhouette which flows into a 72-inch train in the back. Celebrate your figure with grace and sophistication, as Virginia transports you to a bygone era of glamour. Wear it with strappy sandals, a deep red lip, and her matching fingertip veil, 2560V, offered separately.
