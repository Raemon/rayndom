e. Every corner feels like it’s been pulled from a fairytale. What made it even more special was meeting Sabrina, the new manager. She is warm, passionate, and incredibly detail-oriented. You can instantly feel how much she cares—not just about the venue, but about your vision and experience. She walked us through everything with so much enthusiasm and clarity that we left feeling completely confident and inspired. The new owners, Sabrina and Chase are not just maintaining the beauty of the venue—they're investing in thoughtful, meaningful upgrades that make the space even more magical.

knowledgeable about the area, vendors of all sorts, and so sweet! When we visited this venue we instantly fell in love and knew this was exactly what we wanted in a venue for our special day. This venue is very reasonably priced and comes with so much! They have a separate ceremony, cocktail, and reception area. The gardens is decorated so nicely that we didn’t have to bring in any of our own decorations! I cannot recommend this venue enough!

ely, but very corporate/restricted. With the pandemic, we were given the opportunity to cancel without penalty. By that point, we came across The Gardens. We were blown away that this gorgeous venue could be OURS for less than we were paying for a small ceremony area and ballroom elsewhere. Lynn was so nice and professional from the very first email, our multiple visits, and throughout the entire day of. The venue was the perfect size, location, and had everything we needed. Bring a fan for the bridal suite in the summer and don't leave all the cleaning til the final hour are my only pieces of advice. :) Vendors List: Venue - The Gardens at Sutter Creek; Photography: ee Photography of Macon, GA; Catering/Bar - Lunch Lady Catering; Cake - Ingrid Fraser Elegant Cakes; Dessert - Rich's Ice Cream Catering; DJ - JCrew Productions; Flowers - Made in Amador; Welcome Party & Rehearsal Dinner - Renegade Winery.
