## Where to Buy Bachelorette Decorations

There's a lot of bachelorette party decor online, which can make the shopping experience overwhelming. (Trust us, we know––it took us forever to curate this list.) But luckily, after scrolling through hundreds of phallic-shaped straws, we've gained insight into which stores have the best variety, reviews, prices and unique items. Now it's time to pass down this glorious knowledge to you.

  * [**xo, Fetti**](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=116231&awinaffid=565019&clickref=bachelorette-bridal-shower-decor&platform=dl&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xofetti.com%2Fcollections%2Fbachelorette-party-decorations)**:** This online store is women-owned, which we love, and credits itself as a "one-stop-shop for all your party supply needs." They have everything from cute [disposable cameras](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=116231&awinaffid=565019&clickref=bachelorette-bridal-shower-decor&platform=dl&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xofetti.com%2Fproducts%2Ffetti-cam-24-exposure-camera) to groovy [disco ball cake toppers](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=116231&awinaffid=565019&clickref=bachelorette-bridal-shower-decor&platform=dl&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xofetti.com%2Fproducts%2Fpink-disco-topper-4-disco-ball-cake-toppers). The best part about this brand? You can get all of these on-trend items for modest prices.
  * [**Etsy**](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6220&awinaffid=565019&campaign=&clickref=TK-bachelorette-bridal-shower-decor&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dbachelorette%2Bparty%2Bdecorations&platform=pl)**:** If you want highly personalized bachelorette decor, we suggest checking out Etsy. Their site has hundreds of vendors that create unique items that'll leave the to-be-wed and other partygoers feeling impressed and special. You'll find [custom floaties](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6220&awinaffid=565019&campaign=&clickref=TK-bachelorette-bridal-shower-decor&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Flisting%2F1743557579%2Fbachelorette-blow-up-doll-party-favor&platform=pl) where you can add the bride or their partner's face to it or [personalized koozies](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6220&awinaffid=565019&campaign=&clickref=TK-bachelorette-bridal-shower-decor&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Flisting%2F1739178521%2Fpersonalized-coastal-bachelorette-can&platform=pl) that say the bride's name. 
  * [**The Knot Invitations**](https://www.theknot.com/paper)**:** From [coasters](https://www.theknot.com/paper/ceremony-reception/coasters) to [stickers](https://www.theknot.com/paper/ceremony-reception/stickers), The Knot Invitations is what you need if you want custom stationery. The best part about shopping here is that you can match your paper products' design to one another. Once you find an item you like, simply scroll down to the bottom and check out the "complete wedding stationery suites" section to find other items with the same design. 
  * [**Zazzle**](https://www.zazzle.com/s/bachelorette+party+decorations)**:** Think you'll struggle with handwriting a fun and flirty bachelorette party welcome board? Then check out Zazzle for your sign, banner and backdrop needs. Many of their products are customizable and on-trend, like this [pickleball-inspired sticker](https://www.zazzle.com/pickleball_country_club_bachelorette_classic_round_sticker-256017414030433505). 
  * [**Amazon**](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=bachelorette%20party%20decorations&tag=tkcommerce-218-20)**:** We found that Amazon was one of the best sources of good deals and honest reviews with helpful customer photos. Be mindful that there are a lot of retailers on their site selling the same product, so take the time to see which vendor has the best price and reviews. We suggest browsing through their decoration kits, like [this pink one](https://www.amazon.com/UPGRADED-62-Piece-Decorations-Bachelorette-Confetti/dp/B0CZRQ1D4B?tag=tkcommerce-218-20&th=1), if you don't have a lot of time to shop.
  * [**Walmart**](https://goto.walmart.com/c/64733/565706/9383?veh=aff&sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dbachelorette%2Bparty%2Bdecorations&subId1=TK-bachelorette-bridal-shower-decor)**:** This well-known store is a great option if you want to buy bachelorette party items in person. You can also shop online, but you need to ensure you look at reviews since they have third-party sellers on their site. Look at their [party favor bag section](https://goto.walmart.com/c/64733/565706/9383?veh=aff&sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dparty%2Bbag&subId1=TK-bachelorette-bridal-shower-decor) to see their huge variety of carriers for your bachelorette goodies. 
  * [**Personalization Mall**](https://personalizationmall.sjv.io/c/64733/2382364/29824?subId1=TK-bachelorette-bridal-shower-decor&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.personalizationmall.com%2FBest-Selling-Personalized-Wedding-Gifts-d1428.dept)**:** As the store's name suggests, any item you find here can be customized, which is perfect for adding special touches for the bride-to-be. They have [shelf decor](https://personalizationmall.sjv.io/c/64733/2382364/29824?subId1=TK-bachelorette-bridal-shower-decor&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.personalizationmall.com%2FPersonalized-Wedding-Frosted-Shelf-Dcor-Laurels-of-Love-p41323.prod), [wall art](https://personalizationmall.sjv.io/c/64733/2382364/29824?subId1=TK-bachelorette-bridal-shower-decor&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.personalizationmall.com%2FTogether-Forever-Personalized-Wedding-Wood-Frame-Wall-Art-p33338.prod) and more, that can all be personalized with at least two lines of text. Want to save some money? **Use our exclusive code,****KNOT15PM, to get 15% off your entire order.**
  * [**Shutterfly**](https://www.shutterfly.com/t/party-decor)**:** This online store is one of the best places to get decor that you want to add photos to. Our favorite categories on Shutterfly are the [banner](https://go.linkby.com/GYFMKCSK/click-100405049-15200060?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.shutterfly.com%2Fs%2Fbanners%2F) and the [celebration photo board](https://go.linkby.com/GYFMKCSK/click-100405049-15200060?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.shutterfly.com%2Ft%2Fcelebration-photo-boards%2F) sections since there's a wide variety of options to choose from. (**_Psst._** They have a "matching items" section so you can make your bachelorette party decor cohesive.)



## The Best Bachelorette Party Decor Ideas

There are so many ways you can go about the decorations for the bachelorette. To help you narrow down your search or hone in on your vision, we suggest picking a [bachelorette party theme](https://www.theknot.com/content/bachelorette-party-themes) first. Once you do that, selecting which of the following items you need will be easy. 

### Let's Go Girls Banner

All you have to do is send a high-quality picture of the bride or their partner for this funny decor idea. We suggest setting some confetti to the side so you can reuse it for the bride's birthday or gift it as a keepsake.
