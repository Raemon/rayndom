Ryan and Brooke were so enjoyable to work with throughout our wedding planning madness and wedding day! We are so happy we chose to go with Planet Entertainment DJ's! Ryan was re...

sponsive, extremely personable, and fit right in with our families and guests! He truly is the expert in music and made every effort to make our visions come true, even when some of our ideas were pretty out there. The entire experience of working with Ryan was full of laughs and a ton of fun! Ryan made wedding planning so much easier, based on insight from years of experience, and we were confident in him leading our timeline of events and providing the best-fit playlist for our crowd. Ryan and Brooke go beyond the duties of typical DJ's, envisioning the entire event, and genuinely caring about the overall success of the big day and happiness of the bride and groom. It was fantastic having Brooke by my side through it all. I knew that if anything went wrong, she'd know what to do, and that provided me a level of peace that was much needed that day. Thank you so much, Ryan and Brooke, for not just being the DJ's at our wedding, but actually being a part of our very special day!

lso Brooke was there to help with all the behind the scenes details. Also — they were able to pull off a surprise wedding song recorded by my parents 30 years ago…via cassette tape! That was amazing. They are truly the best.

t to meet and talk about your vision for your day and how you would want it to flow. After dong so many weddings he is FULL of ideas and fun ways to keep your guests engaged. It was so fun to pick his brain. He is also full of song suggestions for every part of the day. And while he will still play anything you want, he knows what works best for every situation. It was such a relief that he could run our timeline and he made sure to check in with us throughout the whole ceremony and reception. Thank you for making our wedding day perfect!

Where do you start with Ryan and Brook? They are simply amazing! From the moment we met with Ryan my husband said "I can't imagine anyone else DJ's our wedding"! He had options ...

for everything, knew what he would say in every situation and totally understood that neither of us liked being the center of attention. While that's hard to avoid at your wedding Ryan did an amazing job making us feel like 180 people were watching our every more. Ryan also took the most charge of our schedule which was a HUGE relief. We had no idea where to start and by the end of our meeting it was all planned! His songlists are hugely helpful too! His wife, Brook, was the icing on the cake. She helped the bridal party get drinks before the ceremony, she helped me bustle my annoying dress that kept coming undone, she had chalk for my husbands shirt when he spilled on it and was the first to come to my rescue when someone spilled wine on me! All in all she was my hero! Thank you both so much for being such an integral part of our planning process and making our day a great one!
