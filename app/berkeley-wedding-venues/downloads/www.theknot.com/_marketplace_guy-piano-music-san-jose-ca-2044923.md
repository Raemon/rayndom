Guy was our pianist for our wedding in October 2025. We reached out to Guy way in advance in late 2024, and his communication and professionalism were stellar. Communication was sp...

arse in the beginning because we were still over 6 months away from the wedding, but every time we needed to discuss something, he responded promptly and addressed our questions properly. Closer to our wedding, Guy made sure to send us previews of our chosen songs and went over our requests for each, then adjusted them accordingly to our preference. On the day of, Guy was on time and professional. Our chosen songs were executed beautifully, specifically my song to walk down the aisle to (it was everything I’d imagine it would be). When the ceremony was completed and we were busy taking photos with guests, Guy continued to play beautiful ambience music in the background. Overall, we are grateful for Guy and the service he provided. Highly recommended.

He went above and beyond by learning additional songs at our request, providing regular updates and samples of his progress, which gave us complete confidence that everything would be perfect. On the wedding day, Guy arrived early and seamlessly set up in multiple locations, ensuring beautiful music before the ceremony, during the ceremony, and for our first dance. His talent and artistry added an elegant and emotional touch to every moment. We couldn’t have asked for a better musician to be part of our special day. If you’re looking for a skilled, dedicated, and personable pianist, we highly recommend Guy. Thank you for making our wedding even more magical!

I loved how he would send over a recording of the song he just learned for us (in our case some Studio Ghibli and Disney songs) with a description in the beginning to explain his thoughts and any potential changes in the song. It was a smooth process working with Guy, and he was wonderfully enthusiastic. Absolutely would contact Guy again for other events, and we highly recommend him! Thanks again for helping to make our big day wonderful!
