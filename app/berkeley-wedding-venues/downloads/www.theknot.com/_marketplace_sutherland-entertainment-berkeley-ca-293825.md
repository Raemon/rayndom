Spencer was fantastic at our wedding at Ardenwood this month! I was drawn to working with Spencer as soon as he presented his planning spreadsheet during our first intro call. I'm ...

already a type-A spreadsheet-obsessed type of bride so to have a DJ already have their own spreadsheet with all of the details outlined and thinking 3 steps ahead, it was a perfect match. With all of the information that we shared, Spencer was able to take that with just about a week of notice (because we were a bit delayed :) ), and executed our entire wedding flawlessly. My biggest priorities for the wedding DJ was keeping the wedding on time and keeping people lit on the dance floor - both of which were achieved. Thank you Spencer!!!

Truly top notch and highly recommend for ANY event.

nce! We were honestly so stressed about choosing a DJ, but after just one phone call with Spencer, the stress was relieved. He made us feel completely at ease, and we knew right away we were in good hands. Spencer was incredibly helpful, professional, and detail oriented. As first-time wedding planners, we appreciated how easy he made the entire process, offering helpful suggestions from all perspectives, playlists and multiple music options, and a detailed planning method which made the planning process simple and enjoyable, not overwhelming. On our wedding day, Spencer read the crowd perfectly, and kept the energy up all night. Everyone had an amazing time, and we received so many compliments on the music and fun atmosphere. We hade the Photo Booth included in our wedding package, and it was a total hit! It was easy to use, and our guests had a blast with all the fun props and filters. We loved that everyone got their photos right away, and Spencer even emailed us a link to download all the photos and boomerangs everyone took - such a fun way to relive the memories and see everyone enjoying themselves. Even with a few last-minute changes, Spencer was on top of every detail, making sure everything was exactly how we wanted it. His dedication to making everything perfect truly showed throughout our entire wedding. If you’re looking for a DJ who’s fun, professional, organized, and genuinely invested in making your event unforgettable, we 100% recommend Spencer & his team. He was a huge part of what made our day so special, and we’re beyond grateful we chose him!

We reached out to Sutherland Entertainment for our May wedding at the Berkeley City Club, and knew as soon as we spoke to Spencer that we would be moving forward with his company. ...

Spencer was incredibly insightful, experienced, and innovative in ways that challenge standard DJ services. He offered everything from full service music and audio with club-style transitions, to station and bistro lighting, and ensured that his equipment was elegant and well suited to the venue. His style incorporated both our personal music selections, crowd pleasers, and was able to adjust to the crowd. From the time our dance floor opened to the time it closed, it was never empty. Every compliment were received the morning after the wedding included some mention of how great the DJ was, and how our Tuesday night wedding had such incredible energy. Spencer had our wedding guests doing the worm, the splits, dropping it low, and singing like no one was listening. Thank you, Spencer, for making our special day incredibly memorable and a true party!

Sutherland Entertainment was one of our vendors at our wedding this past weekend at the Brazilian Room in Berkeley, CA and we cannot say enough good things about Spencer! He was on...

the preferred list of vendors for this venue and we can see why. Spencer is detail oriented, professional and a great MC/ DJ. He has a variety of packages that offer AV, DJ-ing and even photo booth services. He is incredibly knowledgeable and we had zero mic feedback, great mic volume and clarity. He was able to read the crowd and kept the party going all night long! Before the wedding he made sure to send over a planning spreadsheet so he knew exactly what it was we wanted. He even helped put up some Chinese lanterns for us on the patio to really bring our vision to life. Day of, he checked in with us the whole day to make sure we were feeling good. We had a small issue with a table falling over and he was the first vendor to come over and reassure us that everything was going to be fine. Overall, Sutherland Entertainment is the DJ to beat and should be your first choice when looking for a full-service, awesome party.

Two days before our wedding, Spencer actually got sick, which would have stressed me out, but he was so clear and comforting in his email that we could trust his replacement (DJ Kevin) that I didn't worry at all. The music was great for the range of guest ages we had (haha!), and Kevin helped keep the energy and timeline of the wedding on track.

s completely taken off guard by how amazing Spencer is! He showed up on time, with a great attitude, and totally set the tone for an amazing wedding. He was also making sure we kept on schedule (we didn't have a day of coordinator). He made great suggestions in a kind, not pushy way. Everyone that attended the wedding raved about how good he was! There were no awkward lulls in the time line thanks to him. And we gave him a list of songs that we liked and he was totally able to pick up the vibe. He was the most organized person there by far, and with the best attitude. His laid back persona made everyone chill a little more, but he was also very structured. We also had him do our lighting, which was amazing (think fairy tale ambiance). And he did microphones and speakers for our family who played violin at our ceremony. Since our wedding on July 7, I've been to 3 other weddings where the DJ seemed lame in comparison. Thank you Spencer! You're amazing.

The uplighting he provided was beautiful as well and really elevated the space! Throughout the process, he was easy to work with, timely, communicated proactively, and was always on top of every little detail. We’d definitely recommend him for anyone looking for a DJ!

because the music was so catchy! We were particularly impressed with Cody's ability to find and mix in specific Chinese songs that we requested. Also all the lights were beautiful, from the warm amber lights along the wall to the hanging lights inside, and along the walkway.

Also, Sutherland Entertainment is a preferred vendor for The Brazilian Room in Berkeley, so if you’re getting married there, they have a special package that’s discounted, which is a great deal.

He played quite a few of the songs that we requested, but not a lot of them. In his defense, though, what he did play was a hit with the guests, which is probably why he is a DJ and I am not :).

Spencer is genuine and honest. Throughout the many months of planning Spencer was available to answer questions and didn’t miss a detail. Also, Sutherland was our top choice for the array of services they offer and for the reasonable prices. We were able to pick a package that fit all our needs; including, lighting, DJ and photobooth! The lighting was perfect with amber up lighting in the reception room, string lights on the patio, colorful lights on the dance floor and more. It all looked beautiful and inviting. DJ Cody was great at his job and kept the party moving. He was easy to work with, took our song requests and was there to help direct guests throughout the night. He was super friendly too! He was engaged with the party and didn’t miss a beat. All his sound levels and timing were perfect. Lastly, the photobooth was a huge hit at our wedding. We are so glad we decided to add it in our package. The prime placement of the booth within the venue, plenty of fun props and prints available to print right away, email or text helped make this a highlight of the night.

One of the tough parts of being the bride is that you don’t get to take in every single aspect of a ceremony. Sometimes you have to trust your groom and guests about how things tu...

rned out. Without exception I heard AMAZING reviews on Spencer’s guitar playing for both our ceremony and cocktail hour (I was either hidden or taking photos during both), people thought he was a recording because the sound was so good and his playing was so flawless. I had several guests rave about the song he played during my entrance (which was pretty awesome) – saying it was a fantastic rendition, even commenting about it in my guestbook. He has a great “menu” of song options and is very professional. He also wired the acoustics of our outdoor (very noisy) venue and all my guests said they could hear the ceremony perfectly (I grilled them – with content-specific questions – because I am a nut.). This guy is amazing – live music is 100% the way to go for a ceremony and he definitely delivers.

For a DJ and guitarist I would rate him a 4.5, he did get the crowd dancing all night, but the third song he played after our first dance, was definitely not on my list, but has lo...

ng has everybody was happy and dancing I was Ok with this. Would recommend him for DJ and guitar playing. Would not recommend the photobooth, it broke down at least three times that I know about. One of my guests had to fix it those three times.

Spencer was amazing. We hired him to pay his guitar during cocktail hour and then DJ the rest of the night. He definitely had the party going.

Spencer was recommended to us by our venue and after just one meeting, we knew why: he's incredibly talented, genuinely passionate about what he does, and a pleasure to work with. ...

He talked to us about our likes and dislikes, listened to us about the kind of wedding we wanted, and gave us amazing guidance about how to make it happen. My fiancé and I both care about music and wanted what was played at the wedding to reflect our taste; Spencer totally understood where we were coming from and made some great suggestions about how to incorporate what we wanted while still keeping the party going (he's great at feeling out the crowd and playing just the right song to get people on the dance floor). In addition to handling the reception, he played pre-ceremony guitar and people are still raving about how beautiful it was -- it really set the tone for everything that followed. He's a total pro. 5 stars!

I hired Spencer on the recommendation of a friend. I thought that the overall VALUE of his services was great. I read the other reviews, and I will say that there were some songs f...

rom my "must play" list that I do not remember hearing. Spencer is professional, and accomodating, I think that he did a GREAT job, both in his guitar playing and as a DJ, he was also REALLY REALLY excellent on the announcing/MC part of my wedding. Would I hire him for another event? - ABSOLUTELY! Would I recommend him? ABSOLUTELY! Again, I think that his whole package is a great value and worth the price.

Choose Spencer! Spencer was simply fantastic from the planning to the execution! He was extremely professional, punctual and makes the daunting task of planning wedding and recepti...

on music really, really easy, and even fun. He played guitar for the wedding and cocktail hour, and then DJ'd for the reception. The guitar playing was absolutely perfect. My only request for the reception was our guests have a good time! Boy did Spencer deliver. He played songs from our request list, but definitely played music appropriate to the age group. He really pays attention and plays music to the crowd on the dance floor, which was awesome. He is respectful of your desires for your wedding and does everything he can to make sure his part of your day is nothing less than perfect. Related to this review is that I planned my wedding and worked with all the vendors. Spencer was consistently the most responsive, and required the least amount of "checking-in". It was an absolute relief to have him as a part of my wedding day. Without any reservations, I highly recommend Spencer Sutherland.
