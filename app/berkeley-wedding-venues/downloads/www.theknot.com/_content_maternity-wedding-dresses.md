Getting married while pregnant adds an extra special element to your day that may leave you feeling even more sentimental and loved. That said, the process of shopping for a maternity wedding dress can feel like something of a hurdle. Many popular wedding brands don't make bridal gowns for pregnant women, and actually, even just finding a maternity evening gown can be a struggle. Whether you're going to be three or seven months along on your big night, you want your dress to make you feel beautiful and confident and, most importantly, fit comfortably around your bump. Take a look at the maternity bridal gowns below that work for any season, dress code, and bride—there's something for everyone. 

**In this article:**

## Where to Buy Maternity Wedding Dresses 

Shopping for a maternity dress for your wedding may require a little bit of creativity and flexibility. It's totally possible to buy a non-maternity gown and have [dress alterations](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-gown-alterations-101) to ensure it fits properly, but if you do that, you need to pay close attention to fabric and fit to ensure it can stretch with your growing bump. 

If you'd prefer a wedding gown made for pregnant women specifically, there are options, but pickings can feel slim. Get even more options by looking for maternity bridesmaid dresses in white or ivory, or go non-traditional in a color other than white. Of course, you can also always opt for a custom design if you want something specific that you can't find. 

FEATURED VIDEO FROM THE KNOT

Below are a few shops you can go to for [wedding dress shopping](https://www.theknot.com/content/top-dress-shopping-secrets) that make beautiful maternity wedding dresses and evening gowns for the big night. 

  * [**Tiffany Rose**](https://www.tiffanyrose.com/us/): One of the few brands that makes maternity wedding dresses for the bride, Tiffany Rose offers a large selection of maternity wedding gowns (as well as other formal dresses and clothing). They have short and long options, an impressive size range, and plenty of different style options, from lacy and feminine to more slinky. They also sell matching accessories, like veils and belts. The [cost of a wedding dress](https://www.theknot.com/content/average-cost-of-wedding-dress) here ranges from as low as $200 to over $500. 
  * [**Bumpsuit**](https://www.bumpsuit.com/): For more stylish and fashion-forward options, there's Bumpsuit. The dedicated maternity brand has an eveningwear section that features beautiful options for a bride. These are the types of gowns that fit around your bump nicely, but don't look like traditional maternity wear, so they're great for the bride who wants something more chic. The selection could be larger, but prices are reasonable at an average of about $200. 
  * [**PinkBlush Maternity**](https://pinkblushmaternity.pxf.io/c/64733/2048677/25601?subId1=Theknot.com-maternity-wedding-dresses&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pinkblushmaternity.com): While PinkBlush doesn't have specific wedding gowns on its site, they do sell a large variety of evening gowns, many of which can work for a bride. Prices are low (usually under $100), but note that these are a bit on the more casual side, so if you're looking for something very formal, they may not have that option. One plus, though, is that PinkBlush dresses are generally very versatile and can easily be worn after pregnancy as well. 
  * [**Dessy Group**](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=88277&awinaffid=565019&campaign=&clickref=Theknot.com-maternity-wedding-dresses&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fdessy.com&platform=pl): It's actually easier to find maternity bridesmaid gowns than maternity wedding gowns, so if you're having trouble, start there. The Dessy Group has a selection of maternity bridesmaid gowns meant to fit nicely around a bump at any stage, and many of them are sold in white or ivory, so they can double as wedding dresses for pregnant women. These dresses are generally pretty minimal and traditional, so if you want to keep it simple, this is a great brand to look at. 
  * [**Revelry**](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=51597&awinaffid=565019&campaign=&clickref=Theknot.com-maternity-wedding-dresses&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fshoprevelry.com&platform=pl): Revelry is another brand that sells maternity bridesmaid dresses that are offered in more bridal colors. They have a decent selection too, with a variety of fabrics and styles, from options that are a bit more stylish and fun to dresses that are on the simple side. Prices are generally about $200 or $300, and the wide size range is great. 
  * [**Club L London**](https://clubllondon.us/): While Club L London is not a maternity brand, they do have a surprisingly nice collection of maternity dresses—and many of them are available in white with a distinctly bridal look. These gowns tend to be more sleek, chic, and on the trendier side, with a glamorous but classic feel. The prices are reasonable too, usually between $100 and $200. 



## Our Favorite Maternity Wedding Dresses 

Many wedding gowns out there can be altered to fit your new pregnant body, but a maternity gown is made with your bump in mind. That means it's designed to accommodate a growing body, like stretching a bit for extra comfort. It can also feature a [wedding dress silhouette](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-dress-silhouettes) that flatters your bump in the best way. Here are some of our favorites. 

### 1\. Tiffany Rose Verona Lace Maternity Gown

![Verona lace maternity wedding dress from Tiffany Rose](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/d4afc516-1fe3-44a1-880f-6b5c92be57dc~rs_768.h-cr_0.289.1408.2166)

_Photo: Tiffany Rose_

This fitted maternity wedding dress is covered in a pretty, feminine eyelet lace that makes it feel traditional and intricate. It's made of smooth and stretchy jersey that has a pleasantly cool feel, with a romantic look to match a [wedding vibe](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-vibes-meaning). Three-quarter sleeves offer a little extra coverage, and a satin sash accentuates the empire waist to show off your bump. 

[$400 | Tiffany Rose](https://www.tiffanyrose.com/us/maternity/clothing/VERGBI/Verona-Maternity-Wedding-Gown-Ivory-White.html)

### 2\. Azazie Rhea Off-the-Shoulder Dress

_Photo: Azazie_

Simple yet beautiful, this cold-shoulder gown has a very classic look. The empire waist lets out into a flowing skirt that offers plenty of movement, while the sweetheart neckline and draped sleeves add a feminine touch. This is a bridesmaid dress, but it is available in a range of shades, including bridal-friendly white alabaster. 

[$129 | Azazie](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=88935&awinaffid=565019&campaign=&clickref=Theknot.com-maternity-wedding-dresses&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.azazie.com%2Fproducts%2Fazazie-rhea-white-alabaster-a-line-off-the-shouler-pleated-stretch-satin-floor-length-maternity-bridesmaid-dress%2F219024&platform=pl)

_Photo: Azazie_

Available in a creamy white color that isn't exactly pure white, this floor-length gown has a very romantic feel. The full skirt offers a lot of movement, and the off-the-shoulder sleeves and cowl neck make it feel extra special. Again, this one is a non-stretchy chiffon material, so be sure to leave some growing room for your bump. 

[$119 | Azazie](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=88935&awinaffid=565019&campaign=&clickref=Theknot.com-maternity-wedding-dresses&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.azazie.com%2Fproducts%2Fazazie-saige-white-alabaster-a-line-pleated-chiffon-floor-length-maternity-bridesmaid-dress%2F72232584&platform=pl)

### 4\. PinkBlush Cream Leaf Textured Midi Dress

_Photo: PinkBlush Maternity_

This midi dress is perfect for the more casual bride looking for something simple yet pretty that doesn't hit the floor. The midi length keeps it at mid-calf, and also makes it more versatile—it's something you can definitely wear after the wedding, even when you're no longer pregnant. A pretty leaf pattern gives it a nature-inspired feel that makes it especially great for a destination beach wedding. 

[$89 | PinkBlush Maternity](https://pinkblushmaternity.pxf.io/c/64733/2048677/25601?subId1=Theknot.com-maternity-wedding-dresses&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pinkblushmaternity.com%2Fproducts%2Fcream-leaf-textured-tiered-midi-maternity-dress)

_Photo: Revelry_

This silky satin dress is made with a growing bump in mind: two extra pleats in the skirt help offer extra room if you need it, and look just as good if you don't. There are built-in bra cups and vertical boning in the bodice for extra support, and it's also stylish, with a modern cowl neck, thin straps and slits to show some leg. 

[$219 | Revelry](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=51597&awinaffid=565019&campaign=&clickref=Theknot.com-maternity-wedding-dresses&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fshoprevelry.com%2Fproducts%2Fmaternity-skye-satin-dress&platform=pl)

This pretty silk maternity gown features vintage-inspired details, like sheer cap sleeves and an embroidered bodice. The empire waist gives you room to breathe, and it's made of lightweight and soft silk that feels so luxurious.

_Photo: Jenny Yoo_

If you're okay wearing a color other than white, this Jenny Yoo gown is a beautiful option. It's available in a prosecco shade that looks like a light, shimmery champagne and can definitely pass as a bridal option (it's also available in four other colors as well if you want to go bolder). The silky fabric offers a closer fit, with an empire waist for more movement and flexibility. With skinny straps and a cowl neck, it has a minimalist chic look that is perfect for the stylish bride. 

[$305 | Jenny Yoo](https://www.jennyyoo.com/products/bridesmaid-dress/addison-maternity?type=available&zCountry=US)

### 8\. Bumpsuit Brushed Satin Gown

![Bumpsuit white satin maternity wedding dress from Revolve](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/01b077d7-85b9-4692-97c7-3e9106e48460~rs_768.h-cr_0.141.967.1430)

_Photo: Revolve_

For pregnant brides who want to feel stylish and chic, this brushed satin gown is a great option. It has a more loose, almost boxy fit that doesn't hide your bump but doesn't feel tight against it either. The strapless neckline keeps it simple and ideal for warm-weather weddings, with a slight boho feel. 

[$225 | Revolve](https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8213893-12527506?sid=Theknot.com-maternity-wedding-dresses&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.revolve.com%2Fbumpsuit-brushed-satin-gown-in-powder-blue%2Fdp%2FBUMR-WD50)

### 9\. Club L London Amaryllis Maxi Dress

![White one shoulder bodycon maternity wedding dress from Club L London](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/f9e6790e-eb29-432d-ba09-47e773400f53~rs_768.h-cr_0.26.600.826)

_Photo: Club L London_

This white body-con dress is perfect for the bride who wants to show off her bump and more. It's made of a soft, double-lined jersey fabric that is perfectly stretchy and comfortable, with a maxi length that feels formal but doesn't threaten to trip you. There's asymmetric flair and a cape sleeve that makes it feel extra dramatic and glam. 

[$135 | Club L London](https://clubllondon.us/products/amaryllis-white-maternity-one-shoulder-maxi-dress-with-cape-sleeve-cl1292021005)

### 10\. Pietro Brunelli Maternity Strapless Drop Waist Maternity Dress

![Pietro Brunelli white strapless drop waist maternity wedding dress from Nordstrom](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/94469d95-8f6e-4511-8df2-49c325509c23~rs_768.h-cr_60.104.1560.2104)

_Photo: Nordstrom_

A drop waist and gathered sides make this an ideal wedding gown for pregnant brides (lots of stretch potential there), but also chic enough to be impressive. The shorter length makes it a bit more on the casual side, but it's great for a daytime wedding or the bride who wants to keep things low-key and easy. 

[$260 | Nordstrom](https://nordstrom.sjv.io/c/64733/1960196/23920?subId1=Theknot.com-maternity-wedding-dresses&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fstrapless-drop-waist-maternity-dress%2F8220299)

### 11\. Revelry Maternity Madeline Convertible Chiffon Dress

![Chiffon maternity wedding dress from Revelry](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/4b7cedd8-7e43-4a5e-b9f7-bdecc218a1b2~rs_768.h-cr_0.177.1067.1600)

_Photo: Revelry_

Convertible dresses are great for anyone, but especially for a pregnant bride who wants a little versatility. The flutter sleeves are ideal for a bit of arm coverage but can be snapped off if you want to show more skin. The fit is classic and simple, and the white color is very bridal—although you can choose a different shade if you want something unique. 

[$199 | Revelry](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=51597&awinaffid=565019&campaign=&clickref=Theknot.com-maternity-wedding-dresses&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fshoprevelry.com%2Fproducts%2Fmaternity-madeline-convertible-chiffon-dress-made-to-order&platform=pl)

### 12\. PinkBlush White Pleated Maternity Halter Dress

Elegant, lightweight and airy, this halter dress is a great pick for a casual celebration during the spring or summer months. The pregnancy wedding dress has a pretty pleated design and an adjustable sash that allows you to cinch in your waist a bit if you want. 

[$86 | PinkBlush Maternity](https://pinkblushmaternity.pxf.io/c/64733/2048677/25601?subId1=Theknot.com-maternity-wedding-dresses&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pinkblushmaternity.com%2Fproducts%2Fwhite-pleated-maternity-halter-dress)

_Photo: Bumpsuit_

This strapless gown is a lot more versatile than it sounds. It's made of a lightweight and breathable fabric that makes it ideal for warmer weather—perfect for a beach wedding maternity dress—and it has shirring at the bodice that makes it feel a bit more adjustable. It can easily be dressed up for a more formal look, but can also be kept on the boho, casual side as well. 

[$295 | Bumpsuit](https://www.bumpsuit.com/products/shirred-strapless-gown)

### 14\. Legoe Heritage Fluid Jersey Slip Dress

![Ivory maternity jersey slip dress from Legoe Heritage](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/566d4354-419a-4724-a885-8b328a0fce54~rs_768.h-cr_0.183.1400.2050)

_Photo: Légoe Heritage_

Made of a soft, stretchy jersey, this slip dress is perfectly slinky and sexy—because who says you can't be sexy when pregnant? You can easily dress it up with heels, hair, makeup and jewelry, but it can also be more casual. And thanks to side zippers for easy nursing access, this makes a great postpartum option as well. 

[$166 | Légoe Heritage](https://legoeheritage.com/products/maternity-fluid-jersey-slip-dress-ivory)

### 15\. Tiffany Rose Nicola Lace Maternity Bridal Gown

![Lace maternity wedding dress from Tiffany Rose](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/036c6458-e403-4986-94bd-4237746b409a~rs_768.h-cr_0.321.1408.2198)
