From start to finish, the folks at Out to Lunch were a pleasure to work with. Communication was wonderful and they were very accommodating. When our big day came, everything was se...

amless with the catering. The food was amazing and we definitely had guests asking if seconds were an option (and portions weren’t small). It can be difficult to find catering that satisfies vegetarian and vegan folks, yet all those that attended our wedding were raving about the moussaka (including myself). The Vietnamese rice rolls were a favorite - we definitely ate many more than we should admit after OTL sent us off to our hotel with neatly packaged leftovers.

Our wedding catering was incredible! We chose a family-style menu with salmon, tri-tip, roasted veggies, mushroom tarts, and garlic mashed potatoes, and every dish was an absolute ...

hit. The salmon was perfectly cooked, the tri-tip was tender and flavorful, and the sides were deliciously seasoned. Serving family style created such a warm, welcoming atmosphere, and our guests couldn’t stop raving about the food! From start to finish, the catering team delivered an unforgettable dining experience that made our celebration even more special. Highly recommend for anyone looking to elevate their event with amazing food and service!

So many of our guests said this was the best wedding food they've had! Bethany was a dream to work with - so friendly and accommodating, would highly recommend!

The food we got from OTL was AMAZING. Honestly everything tasted fantastic, in fact it was better than I even remembered from our tasting with them. We had OTL serve passed appetiz...

ers during cocktail hour, dinner buffet, and late night snacks after dessert and during dancing and everything was a hit. They were really helpful in helping us come up with a menu to accommodate a large number of vegetarian guest while satisfying meat-lovers alike, as well as coming up with a plan to serve our signature cocktails. We did have a bit of a snag a week or so before the wedding when they realized they'd underestimated the cost for staffing and garbage on their quote which increased the cost a bit, but they were willing to work with us and our wedding planner to figure out a backup plan to keep closer to our original budget. However the food was seriously so incredible it was worth it (tons of guests told us how amazing the food was, even days later). For amazing food that will blow your guests away definitely go with OTL!

We recently had OTL Fine Catering make all of the food for our wedding, and I have to say, they absolutely knocked it out of the park. Unbelievable. The owner, Bethany, is an abs...

olute pleasure to work with. She bent over backwards to make everything on our wedding day perfect! ALL of the food was AMAZING! The team came to an outdoor venue, served amazing food, and provided exceptional wait service for 160+ people. I cannot express how impressed I was. Everyone at the wedding could not stop talking about dinner. I would put our wedding food up against any fine dining restaurant in Sonoma County. If I ever have a need for a caterer again, I'm making one phone call, and one phone call only. Thanks OTL!!

We used OTL for our wedding and they were fabulous. We did passed appetizers and a buffet dinner. The buffet was executed beautifully and the food was simply amazing. I am not sure...

how they can make salmon for 130 people without it being overcooked, especially in a buffet setting, but Bethany and her team definitely pulled it off! They also killed it on the cakes. They were very flexible with last minute allergy requests, and the changing final head count. When you book with them, you are getting their head chef, Bethany, on site running the show. They are a small team, so don't expect the incredibly fast turn around time with emails and phone calls that you get with the big catering companies. But we loved that about them! A very intimate and personalized experience. We trusted Bethany and George's process and didn't feel the need to be in contact with them constantly. Would definitely book with them again!!

Very difficult communicating with them. Long periods of time between email’s and many unreturned phone calls. Voicemail box often full. This should’ve been a tip off that things we...

re not well organized. Contract stated 4-5 servers but only 3 people were there. We had paid extra for food we brought to be prepped and replenished and it was not taken care of. Even cups and stirring spoons were not replenished for hot drinks. Paid for specific allergy-friendly food items and these were not available unless a guest asked a server for it, which I did not know in advance and wouldn’t have agreed to. Asked for specific items for hot cocoa bar and they were not provided even though they said it would be, and had I known I would’ve happily brought them myself. A guest asked if there was more bacon and a server said no, then after the wedding a different server told my father-in-law they had another pack of bacon they didn’t "have" to open (like this was a good thing). This was frustrating as some guests didn’t even get any bacon, and this was an item we had specifically wanted for a few gluten-free friends who couldn’t eat the rest of our food. Staff are friendly and helpful when asked, but we would’ve appreciated a more professional look, including ideally non-slip shoes instead of tennis shoes for their own safety! Food=tasty. They could make what we wanted, that was why we went with them. They knew the venue and definitely are capable of making tasty, creative food. But the execution just wasn’t professional. They kindly created labels for the food because I mentioned it, but they were just pieces of paper with the words written in sharpie. It was fine, but if I’d known I would’ve made my own coordinating labels that were a bit more up to our standards. In the end, I wouldn't go with them again. My father-in-law never received a receipt of payment or even any communication that things had been settled, and gratuity was added automatically even though our contract states it is optional (of course we wanted to give gratuity but we wanted to give it on our own terms). They need someone to help with the office/communication side of it all, because they got the food stuff down. Maybe with time they will grow :)
