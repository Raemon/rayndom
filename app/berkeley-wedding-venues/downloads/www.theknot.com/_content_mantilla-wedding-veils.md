This traditional Spanish [wedding veil style](https://www.theknot.com/content/beautiful-wedding-veil-styles) has been around for centuries and has stood the test of time. Beyond their elegance, mantilla veils have a rich history and tradition associated with them. 

To break it down, we spoke with both Samantha Stark, owner of [Blanca Veils](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/blanca-veils-wolfe-city-tx-966971) in Wolfe City, Texas, and Gloria Franklin, owner of [The Mantilla Company](https://www.themantillacompany.com/) in Ocala, Florida, to share their insight on everything you need to know about mantilla wedding veils.

**In this article:** What Is a Mantilla Wedding Veil? | Colors | Lengths | Lace Styles | How to Wear | Where to Buy

## What Is a Mantilla Wedding Veil?

"A mantilla veil is a Spanish-inspired veil that's known for its beautiful lace edging around the entire veil," Stark explains. "Instead of layers or gathers, it lies flat against your head, usually starting right at your crown or hairline, and frames your face with lace."

You've likely seen this beautiful, traditional veil before, as they are a popular choice for brides. While you don't have to be Spanish to wear a mantilla wedding veil, it's important to recognize and understand the cultural origins of the mantilla [veil meaning](https://www.theknot.com/content/does-the-veil-have-to-cover-my-face). 

"Mantilla veils have roots in Spain, where women wore them for religious ceremonies, weddings and other cultural events," Stark says. "They've always been a symbol of elegance, modesty and respect for tradition. However, over time, brides all over the world fell in love with the look, especially for how it highlights lace in such a graceful way."

In addition to bridal mantilla veils, you can also opt for a larger [bride and groom mantilla veil](https://www.themantillacompany.com/collections/ceremony-mantillas-for-bride-and-groom) that drapes over the couple during a traditional [Catholic wedding](https://www.theknot.com/content/catholic-wedding-ceremony-rituals) ceremony. The mothers of the bride and groom will drape the mantilla across their shoulders before the priest performs the nuptial blessing. This type of mantilla veil used for mass is a beautiful and special addition to a wedding ceremony and a common [Mexican wedding tradition](https://www.theknot.com/content/incorporating-mexican-wedding-traditions). 

While mantilla wedding veils are a staple in [Spanish wedding tradition](https://www.theknot.com/content/spanish-wedding-traditions), it's possible they have ties to other countries as well. "Today, mantillas are considered a Spanish Catholic tradition, but it's believed that its origins were shaped by Islamic culture," Franklin shares.

## Mantilla Veil Colors

When selecting a mantilla veil, you may be surprised to learn that they don't just come in one shade of white, but versions of white, off white, cream and ivory. If you're unsure what color your dress actually is, you can look at the tag to see if it says anything other than "white." If your dress is anything other than pure white, a bright white mantilla veil will actually look a bit blue next to your dress, so it's important to select the right color. "Always compare your veil against your dress in natural light," Franklin advises. Your bridal consultant can help with this if you're unsure where to start in terms of [ivory versus white](https://www.theknot.com/content/ivory-vs-white-wedding-dress). 

"The rule of thumb is to keep your veil color close to your dress color so everything looks seamless," Stark tells us. "Surprisingly, most dresses are _not_ white. Almost all of the veils we sell are actually a shade of light ivory or off white. If your gown is bright white, go with a white mantilla. If it's ivory or champagne, choose an ivory veil or a shade of off white. It'll blend beautifully without looking 'off.' If you're ever unsure, I always recommend my light ivory because it's a soft, natural shade of off white and flatters almost any dress shade."

While most bridal mantilla veils you see are white, black mantilla veils have also been worn throughout history. "Black mantilla veils were traditionally worn in Spain for times of mourning or for religious services, especially during Holy Week," Stark shares. "They carried deep cultural and spiritual meaning."

## Mantilla Veil Lengths

Mantilal veils come in a variety of different [wedding veil lengths](https://www.theknot.com/content/beautiful-wedding-veil-styles). Depending on your wedding dress code and personal style, choose the veil length that works best for you. 

### Shoulder Length

"Shoulder length, although somewhat uncommon for weddings, gives a sweet, traditional look," Stark explains. This is typically the shortest veil length and, as the name suggests, will just hit your shoulders. This is a great choice for an elopement or courthouse wedding. 

![Shoulder Length mantilla](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/5723f8c7-09b0-42ec-9e09-1dc1057229f6~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1100.1100)

### Fingertip Length

Fingertip length mantilla wedding veils are one of the most common veil lengths because they feel "balanced and easy to wear," Stark tells us. If you don't want the hassle of a long veil, but still want a traditional bridal look, a fingertip length veil is a great option. 

![Fingertip Length](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/6f9b95d9-1aec-49ef-b6e3-399736b8034f~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1000.1000)

### Chapel or Cathedral Length

"Chapel or cathedral lengths are by far the most common as they frame most dress trains in length," Stark explains. "The longer mantilla veils give that trailing behind you look brides love!" While chapel-length mantilla veils just graze the floor, [cathedral-length veils](https://www.theknot.com/content/cathedral-veil) have a longer, dramatic train. Both options are perfect for making a grand entrance and photograph beautifully as you walk down the aisle.

## Mantilla Veil Lace Styles

"Just as there are many different lengths, there are also many lace styles," Franklin shares. The different types of lace bring very different vibes, so you should choose one that goes well with your wedding dress and overall vision. From soft and romantic to bold drama, there's a mantilla veil lace style for every bride. 

### Chantilly Lace

Lightweight and airy, Chantilly lace is a delicate and beautiful lace that's often used on mantilla wedding veils. Named after the city of Chantilly, France, Chantilly lace dates back to the 17th century, making it a classic and timeless option for weddings. This wispy lace is perfect for brides looking for a romantic and soft veil. 

![Chantilly Lace veil](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/f69c2427-7cc4-4f03-ba60-631698b10520~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1600.1600)

### Alençon Lace

"Alençon lace is made with raised cord outlines, which makes the lace bold and defined," Franklin explains. Sometimes referred to as the "queen of lace," alençon lace is a luxe and stylish option when it comes to mantilla wedding veils. It has a bit more weight to it than Chantilly lace, making it perfect for brides who want their veil to stand out. 

![Alençon Lace veil](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/8b24322c-e321-4325-9982-04770ab0ea5a~rs_768.h-cr_0.60.720.1020)

### Venise Lace

The heaviest of the laces, Venise lace—also sometimes used interchangeably with Guipure lace—is textured and defined. This firm and stiff lace is characterized by a bold, raised floral or geometric pattern. Venise lace is perfect for a bold and textured mantilla wedding veil. 

![Venise Lace veil](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/fe58beb3-bb1c-4302-9bd0-d0b4a1c9bc65~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1200.1200)

## How to Wear a Mantilla Wedding Veil

"Mantilla veils are worn flat, so you'll usually place it at the crown of your head or just behind your hairline," Stark shares. "Some brides even love wearing it a little further back for a softer look. You can secure it with a simple comb hidden under your hair—mine come with a 4-inch silver comb sewn under the lace—or you can even just pin the veil into your hair for an even more versatile look." 

Work with your hairdresser to ensure your [wedding hair with a veil](https://www.theknot.com/content/long-hairstyles-with-veils) works with your mantilla veil. They will also help you secure your veil in your hair on the wedding day, so make sure you tell them you are wearing a mantilla veil and whether or not it has a comb already attached. Pro tip: Franklin suggests you "wear the veil at least two inches back from your hairline."
