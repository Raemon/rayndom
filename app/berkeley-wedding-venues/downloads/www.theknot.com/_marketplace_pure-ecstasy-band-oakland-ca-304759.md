I cannot thank Preston and Pure Ecstasy enough for making our wedding day truly special. Their performance was nothing short of extraordinary, and they truly made our wedding day u...

nforgettable. I have been to so many weddings and I've never seen an entire ballroom get on the dance floor to kick off the night! This band KNOWS how to get people on the dance floor and we never wanted the night to end! The best memories were made and even pants ripped from dancing so hard! They exceeded our expectations in every way and created memories that we will cherish for a lifetime. If you're looking for a wedding band that will elevate your special day to the next level, look no further than Pure Ecstasy. They are worth every penny and more! I highly recommend them to anyone in search of the perfect wedding band. Thank you, Preston + Pure Ecstasy, for making our wedding day the best day of our lives! So much love to you all!

When my husband and I went to see Preston and his performers play at their weekly gig, we were hooked. They are perhaps the most talented group of musicians I've heard and seen in...

a long time. On our wedding day, the weather was unbelievably hot, but Preston and the band didn't skip a beat. They kept the party going, guests of all ages got on the dance floor, and we have some amazing memories that will last a lifetime. Thanks Preston, and Pure Ecstasy!
