Description

As the Misty bride floats down the aisle, she is shrouded in layers of soft tulle that form a slim A-line skirt, the front of which features a high slit. The bodice features an illusion bateau neckline and long sleeves covered in Chantilly lace and beaded lace appliques for a look that is simultaneously daring and delicate.
