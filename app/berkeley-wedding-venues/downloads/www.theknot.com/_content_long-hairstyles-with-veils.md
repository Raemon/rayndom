  * 30 Gorgeous Wedding Hairstyles With a Veil



## How to Style Wedding Hair With a Veil

Veils are typically only worn for part of your wedding day (usually just during the ceremony and for photos), so it's important to select a bridal hairstyle that looks amazing both with and without the hair accessory. That said, you don't want to put the veil on the back burner—in fact, it should be the first thing you select, according to Jennifer Korab, a celebrity hairstylist and the owner of [Renaissance Salon & Spa](https://renaissancehairsalonnj.com/) in Hillsborough, New Jersey. "I recommend starting by choosing the veil—its length, weight and style will dictate whether you need a sturdy updo or can embrace softer waves," she explains. 

[READ MORE Find Your Wedding Hairstylist ](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/beauty-services)

Some veil styles work better with certain hairstyles more than others. "For shorter veils, it's important to envision where the veil will end—at the shoulders, elbows or fingertips," says Hanna Oh, celebrity hairstylist and owner of [821 West The Salon](https://www.821west.com/) in Chicago. "The placement of the veil also affects how much the hairstyle is visible. Longer veils are usually heavier when being fanned on the floor, so an extra secure base is very important." For example, if you want loose waves, Korab says a shorter birdcage or blusher veil might be better. However, if you have a [cathedral veil](https://www.theknot.com/content/cathedral-veil), a full updo or textured braids create a more solid anchor.

Once you've decided on the veil you want, try to decide on placement, as this will also affect the hairstyle you ultimately choose. "High for classic volume or low for a romantic, modern feel, based on your dress' neckline and back detail," Korab says. You should also consider whether you're going to work with your natural texture and length or add extensions, as something like clip-in extensions can affect where you place your veil. 

When [choosing a wedding hairstyle](https://www.theknot.com/content/choosing-a-wedding-day-hairstyle) for the veil, Korab recommends carefully considering your [hair type and length](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-hair-type-tips), as well as the wedding venue and possible weather. "Humidity calls for heat-proof styling, and beach weddings benefit from wind-friendly braids or buns," she notes. Think about any other hair accessories you might want, like a crown, headband or clips, because you don't want to create too much of a cluttered look. 

Lastly, always be sure to opt for a [hair trial](https://www.theknot.com/content/prep-for-hair-and-makeup-trial) that includes your veil. "During your trial, test the hairstyle both with and without the veil so you know how it looks if you choose to remove it at the reception," Korab says. 

### Wedding Hair Down With a Veil

You can definitely choose to wear your hair down with a veil, regardless of the length or texture. Korab recommends "soft, face-framing waves that float effortlessly" if you want to keep things more relaxed and simple. To add a little something, she recommends "a subtle half-twist at the crown that pulls back just enough hair while letting the rest cascade, or a hidden side braid for added texture and grip." For a more polished look, she likes sleek, straight layers. 

If you're going to wear your hair down with a veil, you need to ensure there is a good spot for your veil comb or clip. "I like to build a secure foundation with discrete backcombing, hidden braids, and crisscrossed bobby pins to anchor the veil comb without slipping," Korab says. 

### Half-Up Wedding Hair With a Veil

Half-up, half-down styles work really well with a veil because they let your hair flow, and they also naturally create a good foundation for your veil comb. Korab likes twisted or braided crowns, soft bouffants for extra height, a half-up knot or a twist-and-tuck. For some texture and a boho vibe, she recommends fishtail or rope braid accents or a waterfall braid. 

### Wedding Updos With a Veil 

Updos are also an ideal style with a veil, since they make it pretty easy to secure the comb without much disruption. "Updos pair beautifully with a veil and oftentimes help give more volume to the base of the veil too," Oh says. Some styles Korab recommends include low chignons, sleek or braided buns, messy textured updos or soft French twists. "Placing the veil over the updo gives a more classic and formal look, while placing it under gives a more modern feel and lets the hairstyle shine," she says. 

### Find your kind of venue

From barns to ballrooms, discover reception venues that feel like you.

## 30 Gorgeous Wedding Hairstyles With a Veil

Part of making your veil look great is to pick the right hairstyle for both your overall vibe and your dress. "The veil is often selected to complement the dress," Oh says. "But the hairstyle should be what suits the bride best. Make sure to always keep in mind what hairstyle looks best on you, and the veil will become the best accessory." And remember: A strong base and anchor for the veil is really important, especially if you plan on wearing your veil for a while. "I recommend opting for styles with more structure, like low chignons, braided buns or twists, which provide a solid base to keep both your hair and veil in place comfortably," Korab says. Here are some great options for veil hairstyles. 

### 1\. Long, Loose Curls With Veil 

![Bride with long hair in loose curls and veil](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/0fb32dac-5310-4622-ba40-79b6b694a4b3~rs_768.h-cr_0.54.808.1131)

Keep your overall look classic and simple by leaving your hair down and adding a long veil. For brides with long locks, loose, bouncy waves look beautiful with a [veil or no veil](https://www.theknot.com/content/is-veil-on-wedding-day-necessary). The best part is that you don't have to worry about messing up your [wedding updo](https://www.theknot.com/content/updos-for-long-hair) when you unclip the veil. 

### 2\. High Ponytail With Veil 

![High ponytail wedding hairstyle with veil](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/2b9f5784-28b0-4b4b-a797-06218fb35f24~rs_768.h-cr_177.0.1600.1067)

A teased, high ponytail is a fun and glamorous look for your wedding day. This bridal hairstyle with a veil feels more dressed up thanks to the slicked-down sides and middle part, and the veil looks great clipped on top of it—this helps create a little volume. 

### 3\. Voluminous Bun With Veil 

![Voluminous bun wedding hairstyle with veil](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/efd9ca71-97f2-483a-86b4-8cc6d978cc6a~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1080.1440)

Keep your hair out of your face the entire night while also looking incredibly elegant with a bun hairstyle with a veil. Teasing the hair a bit adds some volume to the top, which makes this look really pretty. You can set the veil clip right above the bun so it will sit in the middle of the back of the head. 

### 4\. Twisted Half-Up, Half-Down Hairstyle With Veil 

![Half-up, half-down wedding hairstyle with veil](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/5dd556a3-4f64-4fc3-aa1a-2cae8eda7373~rs_768.h-cr_0.54.808.1131)

A half-up, half-down hairstyle is another classic bridal look that pairs well with almost any type of veil. This bride pairs a half-up, half-down hairstyle that is twisted back with a long, simple veil. It's easy to clip the veil into the style and just as simple to take it out. 

### 5\. Bouncy Curls With Veil 

![Bouncy curls with wedding veil](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/a20d1d1d-99e8-46ab-8300-9319db57ea21~rs_768.h-cr_177.0.1600.1067)

If you want to leave your hair down, it's hard to go wrong with big, bouncy curls and a middle part. This look feels both on-trend and classic, and it's fairly low-maintenance. It also happens to look great with a veil—even a more elaborate, show-stopping piece. 

### 6\. Hair Accessory With Veil

You can definitely wear a bridal veil with a hair accessory—you just have to make sure the placement is right. This is a great example of that. A glittering hair clip on the top of your head looks beautiful next to a simpler veil that is clipped more towards the back of your head.

Elegant and sophisticated, a low bun is an easy wedding updo with a veil that looks great even as the night goes on. You can clip the veil directly above the bun, which will make it look even longer. 

### 8\. Loosely Pulled Back Hair With Veil 

![Loosely pulled back long wedding hair with veil ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/aa5629e7-7e6f-4a0c-a114-a5209f9eacff~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.808.1077)

A boho take on a half-up, half-down hairstyle, this loosely pulled-back look is great for brides with long hair. You can leave your hair in loose waves or curls and leave some tendrils in front. Clip the veil into the hair—just be careful when removing it. 

### 9\. Twisted, Vintage-Inspired Look With Veil 

![Twisted vintage-inspired wedding hairstyle with veil](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/862d23a7-a686-484e-a6ce-d84b69d3d3a7~rs_768.h)

This bride is proof that a veil can even work with a more elaborate hairstyle. This low, twisted style seems almost a bit vintage-inspired and is so pretty to look at. To make sure it's on display, clip a slightly smaller, less voluminous veil low at the back of your head so it doesn't cover your entire style. 

### 10\. Coordinating Hair Accessories

If you're a bride taking part in something like a traditional Indian wedding, you're more than likely wearing bejeweled hair accessories, like a tikka or a hair brooch. If that's the case, you can choose a veil that matches, like this colorful option—it has jeweled embellishments that tie into the other accessories. 

### 11\. Low Chignon With Long Veil 

![Low chignon with veil wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/9a75933b-f0c3-4d2f-ab25-2e31eaa777fd~rs_768.h-cr_89.0.1512.1067)

If you're going to go for a long, cathedral-style veil, let it be the star of the show: Pick a classic hairstyle, like a low chignon. This is a pretty and sophisticated look that allows your veil to shine, but still looks beautiful on its own. 

### 12\. Old Hollywood Waves With Veil 

![Old Hollywood waves wedding hairstyle with veil](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/8d864f05-94a2-456b-9c7f-992bc85a49f0~rs_768.h-cr_89.0.1512.1067)

Opt for old-school glamour and elegance with Old Hollywood-style waves. A deep side part and carefully brushed out curls look beautiful with almost any dress and [veil style](https://www.theknot.com/content/beautiful-wedding-veil-styles). Add the veil clip at the crown of your head for a little bit of volume.

This is another example of how you don't have to shy away from bold hair accessories just because you're also going to wear a veil. This bride's custom headband has a unique, boho look that actually works really well with her long sheer veil. Wear the veil lower on the back of your head if you're going to pair it with a headband. 

### 14\. Large Low Bun With Hair Accessory and Veil 

![Large low bun wedding hairstyle with veil](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/2d84a43e-a8c7-45c2-a159-4ac41935813b~rs_768.h-cr_0.54.808.1131)

A voluminous low bun looks gorgeous on its own and underneath a veil. Go for timeless sophistication by slicking the hair back tightly, only to end in a large bun that stands out. You can also add a sparkling hair accessory at the part. The veil can easily clip in right above the bun. 

### 15\. Knotted Low Bun With Veil 

![Knotted low bun wedding hairstyle with veil](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/fe634c99-5113-44f5-b38f-0979beb709d6~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.808.1077)

For this desert wedding, this bride opted for a wedding veil updo that is a bit more low-key and relaxed: a low, knotted bun sitting at the nape of her neck. Because the hair isn't slicked back and she's left some tendrils out, this look doesn't feel super formal; however, adding a veil definitely makes it seem a little extra special. 

### 16\. Embellished Headband With Veil 

![Embellished headband with veil wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/e38a341b-cfc4-4f9b-a3f9-c7cc4e74572a~rs_768.h-cr_0.54.808.1131)

Add some texture via accessories to your bridal hair with a veil look. Long waves or a simple blowout look even more special when you add a unique accessory, like this embellished headband. Clip a long veil behind the headband to accent it. 

### 17\. Bridal Hair Down With Veil 

![Bridal Hair Down With Veil, bridal hairstyles](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/9ead9fc1-ebf9-4a10-bacb-c434a18152ce~rs_768.h-cr_65.521.2048.2504)

For brides with long hair who don't want to pull it all back, some pretty curls might be all you need. To put all eyes on your veil, leave your hair down, then clip the veil in at the crown of your head. Don't be afraid to choose a more embellished or [embroidered veil](https://www.theknot.com/content/embroidered-veil-trend) with this simple hairstyle. 

### 18\. Elegant Bridal Updo With Veil 

![Elegant bridal updo wedding hairstyle with veil](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/6a42015a-077d-4849-a006-6fada42214d2~rs_768.h-cr_0.54.808.1131)

A carefully pulled-back updo can feel quintessentially bridal, especially when paired with a veil. If you don't want to feel like all of your hair is hidden underneath the veil, leave some face-framing tendrils out. You can also opt for a middle part for a more modern vibe. 

### 19\. Low Braid With Veil 

![Low braid with veil wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/d688c382-4afb-4fc8-bc27-dfde417ae3a2~rs_768.h-cr_2.0.1078.1435)

Braided hairstyles can have a boho feel to them, but that's not always the case—this look is proof of that. Brides with long or medium-length hair can opt for a low, braided updo, like this one, which ends up looking sophisticated and polished with a hint of volume on top. The veil flows over this really nicely. 

### 20\. Bob and Bangs With Veil 

![Bride with short hair and veil](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/1e595763-992a-40be-bed1-f156c7f303b5~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.808.1077)

_[Photo: Tee & Rebecca](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/tee-and-rebecca-salinas-ca-2023935)_

This look is a prime example of how sometimes keeping it simple can be the best way to go. If you have short hair, don't feel the need to add extensions to create a more complicated style. This short bob with bangs looks so pretty underneath a long veil. 

### 21\. Natural Curls With Veil 

![Natural curls wedding hair with veil](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/c1088803-86ba-4c9f-8b10-a805a189e53e~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.808.1077)

Keep your gorgeous natural hair texture and curls on your wedding day. This shorter style works with almost any type of veil. You can also add a headpiece like this one for some extra glitz and glam. 

### 22\. Unique Crown With Veil 

![Unique crown with veil wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/bdcf1b15-61d5-4736-b0da-ea83f6f82b33~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.808.1077)

_Photography: Kaitlyn Luckow & Alex_

No one is going to forget your wedding look any time soon when you add unique touches inspired by your own personal style. This bride, for example, opted for a [pearl-embellished veil](https://www.theknot.com/content/pearl-wedding-veils) and didn't stop there: She also added a large, crown-like headband. In this case, there's no such thing as "too much." 

### 23\. Side-Swept Updo With Veil 

![Side-swept updo with veil wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/3f4b20c6-b283-40c0-a740-0f160ca757a3~rs_768.h-cr_0.54.808.1131)

_[Photography: Ellie McKinney Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/ellie-mckinney-photography-winston-salem-nc-2021484),__Hairstylist: Taji Natural Hair_

This bride pulled her long locs back into a side-swept updo that looks so elegant with her veil. Add a little glittery touch with some sparkling hair accessories, and be sure to clip the veil in at the back of your head so it doesn't hide your updo. 

### 24\. Small Braid With Veil 

![Small braid with veil wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/ee862c5f-185e-42bc-b511-a6c6fc34450b~rs_768.h-cr_0.180.1080.1620)

For a more relaxed and low-key vibe, keep your long hair down. With this bridal hairstyle for long hair with a veil, you can add some soft waves, and pulling some of your hair back into a French braid is a pretty touch. Adding a veil to the back of your head also allows the braid to show in all the photos. 

### 25\. A Bun Over the Veil 

![Bun over veil wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/38653101-4f83-4d76-8cb7-bca43dfe063a~rs_768.h-cr_0.27.808.1104)

In most cases, brides will position their veil to be clipped in their hair directly over the bun, so it cascades over it as it flows down. But if you opt for a higher bun, like this one that is positioned right at the crown of the head, you can clip in the veil directly underneath the bun. This doesn't distract from your hairstyle and makes taking it out easy. 

### 26\. Chignon With Birdcage Veil 

![Chignon with birdcage veil wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/1af5ca13-30c3-4a4a-9592-7cd5485a1d59~rs_768.h-cr_0.22.1467.1978)

A birdcage veil is a little different than the long, flowing veils many brides choose, since it's so much shorter. Because this veil has a distinctly vintage feel, you can complement it with a vintage-inspired hairstyle, like a low chignon that evokes elegance. 

### 27\. Long Fishtail Braid With Veil 

![Long fishtail braid wedding hairstyle with veil](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/1e8cf35c-d141-47f5-b298-6a13fb589be8~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.808.1077)

_Photo: Kelly Anne Photography,__Hairstylist: Hair by Desilee_

A carefully constructed fishtail braid with long hair has bohemian vibes while still looking sophisticated and very bridal. You can still wear a veil with an intricate style like this one—just slide it into your hair gently right at the base of the braid. Use a comb-style veil, like this bride did, to reduce the risk of snagging your hair. 

### 28\. Tight Curls With Short Veil 

![Tight curls with short veil wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/fde76746-5244-49ad-82e9-33d64faa94ad~rs_768.h-cr_0.54.808.1131)

_[Photo: Abbey Domond Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/abbey-domond-photography-stamford-ct-417935),__Hairstylist: Arel Quintese_

Shiny, tighter curls that fall to your shoulders look especially pretty with [short wedding veils](https://www.theknot.com/content/short-wedding-veils), like a blusher veil. This shorter veil allows your hair to stand out, but still looks so pretty and elegant. Add a sparkling hair accessory if the veil is simpler. 

### 29\. Beach Waves With Veil 

![Beach waves with veil wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/d505793c-4d79-4bc0-9cd4-b86be24cb474~rs_768.h-cr_0.54.808.1131)

Beach waves can sound super casual, but when done right, they are the perfect low-maintenance look for a bride, especially if you're getting married at a beach or tropical destination. A veil also makes relaxed beach waves look more formal in photos and during the ceremony. 

### 30\. High Bun With Veil 

![High bun with veil wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/b567203e-b462-4be8-be6d-b551a03c5bb6~rs_768.h-cr_0.54.808.1131)

_Photo: Jessica Oh Photography,__Hairstylist: BJ Grand Salon & Spa_

Keep all of your hair off your shoulders the entire night with a top knot. This high bun style works with a veil: Simply clip it in underneath the bun so it doesn't have too much volume.
