r very first conversation, Isaac demonstrated a level of professionalism and artistic refinement that immediately set him apart. On the wedding day, he had a calming presence, which is no small feat at an event of this scale and significance. What impressed me most was his ability to capture not only the grandeur of the occasion, but also the quiet, intimate moments that truly defined the day for our family. The images are timeless, elegant, and deeply moving. The photographs feel more like heirlooms than simple documentation. My daughter and her husband were radiant in every frame, and the beauty of the setting, the guests, and the celebration itself was preserved with extraordinary care and artistry. We entrusted Isaac with one of the most important days of our lives, and he exceeded every expectation. I am profoundly grateful for his work and would recommend him without hesitation to any family seeking the very highest standard of wedding photography.

be fully present on our wedding day. Our Sonoma farm wedding unfolded with a gorgeous outdoor ceremony, cocktail hour and dinner reception, followed by music and festivities in the barn. Isaac captured every moment with such artistry and intention. The images feel effortless yet elevated as every frame tells a story, from quiet, emotional moments to the joy and movement of our guests celebrating into the night. The photographs from our first dance in the barn truly took our breath away. The way Isaac used the natural light, textures of the wood, and atmosphere of the space made the images feel cinematic and timeless. Working with Isaac was seamless, professional, thoughtful, and genuinely joyful. Looking through our gallery feels like reliving the day exactly as it felt. The images are beautiful, emotional, and full of life. We are endlessly grateful for his vision and would recommend him without hesitation to anyone dreaming of a wedding that feels both authentic and artfully captured.

at sunset and Isaac was really helpful giving inspiration for places to shoot as well as fun, cute, romantic poses to try out. We loved his work so much that we ended up having him shoot our wedding too! I had seen other wedding photography which at times appeared dull and uninspiring to me but Isaac's photos all have a quality of liveliness which really captures the energy and happy, exciting feelings of the day. We cherish all of the photos and are overjoyed seeing the results of his work, often looking back to reminisce over them. Isaac was really easy to work with and made us feel comfortable each time. It was easy to develop trust with him and we plan to use him for any other photoshoots in the future. We would highly recommend to anyone!

d out great on the photos. As a couple with demanding careers, I much appreciated how quickly Isaac was with replying to emails. We had a pretty tight budget, and Isaac was able to offer us a package that landed pretty close to our budget and only had the items that we needed the most (mini engagement photoshoot for the website and wedding day). Our ask for him was to get some candid shots as we feel pretty awkward in front of the camera. I personally think that the wedding day pictures came out more naturally because of the setting being surrounded with friends and families, and Isaac and Sushen did a great job capturing the candid moments beautifully. Isaac even had an idea for me to pose by climbing up a wooden stair ladder for a shot that I honestly wasn't sure how it was going to turn out while doing it, but it ended up turning out beautiful and magazine-like in addition to other ones that he asked us to pose for. Isaac put together a behind the scenes video that also showed the reactions of guests to our photo place cards before we had entered the reception area, and this was lovely in that we got to see our guests' reactions that we weren't able to see. The only minor feedback would be that for the large group photo that was requested prior to the wedding (all 75 guests in one group picture after the ceremony) wish there had been more directions given to guests to follow (using the mic that I had offered for directions to be shared aloud) how to come together / move around in an organized and efficient way that would work for the pictures. But overall, it has been a great experience working with Isaac for these past several months and we are very happy with his work that captures the moments of our special day in a soft and hear-warming manner.

ographer. 1) they were extremely thoughtful in helping us plan our wedding day schedule and what we wanted to prioritize 2) the natural style, colors and joy captured in the photos is exactly what we like 3) after looking at the packages and comparing, they are a tremendous value 4) composition and storytelling is massively important and Love Knot is at the top in these departments 5) their command of lighting is masterful After working with the team, we found our first impressions to be accurate, as our expectations were met and exceeded. Love Knot Photography is definitely the best choice.

A few things that stood out the most about Isaac were how responsive he was, how he was able to accommodate to our budget, and how he took pictures from angles and views that turne...

d out great on the photos. As a couple with demanding careers, I much appreciated how quickly Isaac was with replying to emails. We had a pretty tight budget, and Isaac was able to offer us a package that landed pretty close to our budget and only had the items that we needed the most (mini engagement photoshoot for the website and wedding day). Our ask for him was to get some candid shots as we feel pretty awkward in front of the camera. I personally think that the wedding day pictures came out more naturally because of the setting being surrounded with friends and families, and Isaac and Sushen did a great job capturing the candid moments beautifully. Isaac even had an idea for me to pose by climbing up a wooden stair ladder for a shot that I honestly wasn't sure how it was going to turn out while doing it, but it ended up turning out beautiful and magazine-like. Isaac put together a behind the scenes video that also showed the reactions of guests to our photo place cards before we had entered the reception area, and this was lovely in that we got to see our guests' reactions that we weren't able to see. The only minor feedback would be that for the large group photo that was requested prior to the wedding (all 75 guests in one group picture after the ceremony) wish there had been more directions given to guests to follow (using the mic that I had offered for directions to be shared aloud) how to come together / move around in an organized and efficient way that would work for the pictures. But overall, it has been a great experience working with Isaac for these past several months and we are very happy with his work that captures the moments of our special day in a soft and hear-warming manner.

Isaac did an amazing job at our SF City Hall photoshoot. We've worked with a few photographers before, however what stood out about Isaac was knowing how to pose us (which we real...

ly appreciate), the angles, and all the shots he took. He knows how to choose the right ones to edit out of a thousand that he takes in an hour timeframe. He has an eye for detail, catching that a part of my hair is out of place or in the way to the suit collar not being in the correct place. I don't think we've had other photographers catch as many of the small details as he did, which is very much needed in a photographer to ensure that not just the photos coming out looking amazing, but that you also feel and look great as well in them. He really knows his way around SF City Hall as he knew where to get all the beautiful shots. Even though it was not full, but also not empty, we weren't the only ones there, the pictures came out amazing looking as if we had the entire place to ourselves, especially the grand staircase.. all about the right timing. Highly recommend Isaac as he will do an amazing job, especially at catching all the right lighting, poses, and angles!

His use of lighting and the natural environment is really special. The natural aesthetic of the finished photos is gorgeous. I have a large family and it was no easy task to deal with their different personalities and requests and Love Knot handled everything perfectly. The entire time throughout this process of planning and throwing a wedding Isaac has been very responsive and willing to help us with any questions we have anytime. It's an art to create photos this special, and another type of art to manage a business and respond to the individual needs of a client. And it's beautiful to see both come together so seamlessly. I will definitely be recommending Love Knot Photography to any of my family or friends who may be searching for a photographer.

Overall I would say Isaac and Love Knot Photography are just what I was hoping to find in a wedding photographer. Someone who is very creative, friendly, organized and experienced....

I could totally trust he would see to it that my photos were taken care of in every way possible. The standard photos you would expect at a wedding and unique photos that were original to our seashore location all turned out great! The photos started as we were getting ready. Isaac took some beautiful shots of the wedding dress and important jewelry I was wearing. Abstract moments before the ceremony were a blur in my mind and it was so fun to relive the events through the behind the scenes photos. Isaac and his team got some great photos of all the little ceremonies we had scripted for the ceremony program as well as the games and activities during the reception. Taking different ideas and types of shots for the sunset photos was one of my favorite parts of the day. For me it was a chance to get away from the party for a moment and fun to work with Isaac one on one and see the ideas he had for taking some photographs that will be special forever. During our sparkler grand exit, Isaac was very helpful in organizing our guests. As well as my husband and I. The photos turned out very romantic. Some of my favorites of the whole day. Thank you Isaac and Love Knot!

And the sunset photos have a magic quality to them. I definitely got so many photos its difficult to decide which ones to print and frame for the wall.

We made the BEST decision to hire Isaac and Love Knot Photography. To let you know a little bit about our experience, we had a phone call to get to know Isaac and were very impress...

ed with his experience and attitude towards wedding photography. He will handle your wedding with care and we can tell that he has a very proven track record and base of experience to draw from. Plus his artistic instincts are insanely talented. From looking at his portfolio I was very impressed with the work and after talking with him I was very confident that it would be a great match with our wedding. We opted to have an engagement session and are very glad that we did. He provided some much appreciated tips for location ideas and we selected two locations that fit our taste. Golden Gate Bridge and Marin Headlands. It was such a fun shoot, we got a wonderful sunset and Isaac captured it beautifully in the photographs. For the wedding day, photography was one of the most important parts of the day for us, as well as our families. Isaac helped us to setup a timeline for the day so we knew when to schedule family photos, couple's photos and photos with our wedding party and flower girls. The group photos were very well organized and Isaac had many ideas for my husband and I to try out for our couple photos. There were also times when we forgot all about photos and just enjoyed the night, and I'm really happy to see some incredible candids from these moments. Sometimes I didn't even know they were taking pictures!?! Our guests commented on how well of a job the photography team was doing and how hard they were working, so I really appreciate hearing that and seeing it in the end result. The effort put in was very noticeable in the photo album, these photos are purely magic! The colors are soft and beautiful and we are just filled with joy every time we look at them. I am thankful everyday for being able to have such a lovely wedding and for having such amazing photos to document it. Each one is art!

Unfortunately, because of Covid-19, we haven't been able to have our wedding yet. We have delayed the date a few times and currently have it scheduled for next year. Isaac has been a really big help with all of this craziness and change of plans, which I really appreciate! He has done so much that isn't even required, just above and beyond. For example, he sent us boards with ideas about wardrobe we could use if we decide to do an engagement shoot. And he recommended some DJs because we were having trouble finding the right team. We have had a few zoom consultations and its obvious that he is very knowledgeable and experienced. I have a feeling these are going to be epic photographs and all the planning and waiting will be well worth it when we are finally able to party with our families and friends. Summer next year can't come soon enough!

pher I'm sure you found Isaac and his team because of their incredible portfolio or great recommendations from someone who had the opportunity to work with them. They are the BEST! I can vouch for them but the work speaks for itself. Its really quite artistic and special, above and beyond my hopes and expectations for my modest wedding. I've had friends who neglected to find a true master of photography and their pictures definitely suffered. There is one friend in particular who didn't like her photos much and actually wound up hiring another photographer to redo some of the portraits from her wedding. Being in her bridal party, I took it as a lesson learned and definitely wanted to spend time looking at options and meeting with potential photographers. When I found Isaac and Love Knot Photography I was very impressed with everything they offer. Its very good service at a fair price and the photographic skill is unparalleled. Honestly, I was expecting their prices to be higher and feared not being able to afford it. But I got exactly what I was hoping for, and engagement session, wedding shoot and wedding album. Luckily the price fit my budget. Because of the pandemic, I'm very glad we were able to have this celebration last year while the world was still 'normal'. I've very much appreciated having the album as a way to look back and remember so many parts of the wedding day. It was beautiful in my mind and its beyond words to have photographs which capture that feel!! I realize this is a tough time to be planning for a wedding but I'm glad to have a chance to say a few words about Isaac and Love Knot Photography because I feel they would take care of you however you need for any type of celebration. Including what may be called for now or next year. Everything in my experience puts them in that highest group of vendors I've met or worked with.

and spontaneous and natural while still being well-refined. I love the shots of our preparations and all in all there is a beautiful collection of staged detail shots, portraits and completely candid moments. Isaac also took some of our ideas and ran with them, with way better results than we could have ever hoped for. Isaac is very professional, fun to be around, motivated, passionate, he is a rock-star! There were all kinds of moments in the day where we were so glad to have Love Knot Photography. For example, sunset photos were pushed back a few minutes because I had a problem with my shoes, still Isaac found an epic place for us to shoot where the light was still golden and magic. He works very well under pressure and has lots of ideas for fun and creative images to try. There were other times of the day where I didn't even know Isaac or his second photographer were there capturing the moment. Looking back at the photos I literally would see a photo and think how did he get that one! It's awesome to know that your photographer will work that hard for you and get such special works created.
