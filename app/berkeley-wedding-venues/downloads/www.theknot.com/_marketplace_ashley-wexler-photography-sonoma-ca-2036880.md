TL;DR - We could not have been more fortunate to have found Ashley to be our wedding photographer - not only were we thrilled with our photos, she made us feel comfortable and joyf...

ul throughout the entire process! The long version - We found Ashley through The Knot at the outset of our wedding planning process. Being from the Bay Area myself, it was important to me to have a wedding photographer who knew the region well and her expertise and familiarity with the area impressed me in our initial conversations. However, my now-husband and I currently live on the East Coast, adding an additional layer of complexity for scheduling and planning. Ashley was patient with us as we nailed down a date and a venue before we were ready to confirm a photographer and she answered all of our questions about the logistics and contracting process with candor and responsiveness. However, it was during our engagement session that we realized just how lucky we were to be working with Ashley. We had a limited window of time to do the shoot while back in the Bay Area visiting family, and the forecast had some rain for the date we selected. Ashley was positive and upbeat the entire time, not complaining once about the weather and making it a super fun experience for us as well. Ashley is so talented that she was able to “make lemonade out of lemons,” leveraging the challenging circumstances to produce beautiful and unique photos that we absolutely love. In advance of our actual wedding, our travel schedule from the East Coast meant that we weren’t able to do a walkthrough of the venue with Ashley. She went above and beyond, reaching out to the venue to set up a separate walkthrough and sending us shots of various backdrops to get our feedback. She also scouted offsite locations for our golden hour photos. On the day of the wedding, seeing Ashley felt like seeing an old friend. Getting ready and first look are both very emotional parts of the day so we felt so fortunate that we felt so comfortable with her there to document it all. She also calmly and cheerfully was able to adapt and go with the flow on our wedding day, even when the toasts ran long. This was when her knowledge of the area really shone - she was able to capture stunning golden hour photos with a beautiful view that feel both very unique to us as well as rooted in the Bay Area, the place we call home - all under a compressed timeline. Her eye for the right framing and locations around the wedding venue itself also made for gorgeous, artistic photos that we were thrilled with. We cannot recommend Ashley highly enough!

Ashley was truly an amazing photographer from the moment our first phone call took place. My husband and I are not people that wanted our wedding to be a “photoshoot”, and we’re h...

oping for a photographer that could capture authentic moments throughout our special day, while still getting a few of those classic wedding day portraits. Ashley’s warmth and enthusiasm to our request was immediately felt. She was an excellent guide throughout the time leading up to the wedding and was exactly who we were hoping for day of. Ashley was skilled in artistically capturing the special moments of our day. Her casual yet knowledgeable demeanor immediately made everyone feel as ease, especially during the portrait taking part of our wedding. My husband and I had never had professional photographs done before, and are not people who enjoy getting our photo taken a bunch, so we were worried about the portrait session feeling awkward. Ashley embraced this about us and was able to direct us through the portraits with ease, capturing wonderful shots we will cherish forever. On our wedding day, Ashley also brought a second shooter who was equally as wonderful as well! With two shooters, it felt like no moments were missed. I would highly recommend Ashley to anyone looking for a fun, talented photographer to make their day special. One of my own bridesmaids has already said she’d hire Ashley for her own wedding after meeting her too!

We absolutely loved working with Ashley and her team! From the moment we first met her, she stood out among all the other photographers we interviewed because of her experience, co...

nfidence, and fun personality. She has such a great ability to take control on a busy wedding day while still keeping things light and enjoyable. We received our teaser photos so quickly, and the quality was incredible — we instantly knew we made the right choice. Our final gallery included so many beautiful shots and thoughtful details, and she’s stayed so communicative even after the wedding about timelines and updates. I’d highly recommend her to any bride planning a wedding in the coming year — and she also takes the sweetest family photos if you’re looking for that too!

She took great dance floor action shots that make us feel like we’re back at the party. 4\. We didn’t have to email back and forth and could text her. 5\. The resolution of her photos are super high - which gives you flexibility. 6\. She can go with the flow when the unexpected inevitably occurs on your wedding day. 6\. Her website for downloading and viewing photos was user friendly.

ed around our photos in great time and they turned out fabulous. She has a great eye for catching the magic of candid moments, but has a vision for artistic shots as well. Her confidence and experience moves mountains, and her humility and humanity make her an absolute joy to work with. One of my biggest tips for upcoming brides - get a photographer that you actually enjoy being around, because they'll be by your side the whole day. And Ashley absolutely checks this box! So thankful for her awesome spirit. An absolute rockstar that you'll want on your wedding team for sure!

and directed us on how to pose to capture the perfect shots. Before the wedding she reached out multiple times to make sure she could help with whatever I needed and had me write a list of photos and people that were important for her to capture. Our pictures came back quick and are all so beautiful. She was really able to capture the essence of the day and I am so grateful to have these beautiful photos forever. I’m very happy we had Ashley as our photographer! Thank you!

My husband and I are a more mature bridal couple in our 50s–60s, so finding the right photographer was very important to us. We have discerning taste, and our priority was to have ...

beautiful photos that documented the day authentically, without feeling staged or intrusive. We wanted to be present in the moment rather than spending our wedding day posing for endless “Instagram-worthy” shots. From the very beginning, Ashley understood exactly what we were looking for. When we received our photos, we were absolutely delighted. She captured not only wonderful images of us, but also so many candid, heartfelt moments of our friends and family. Since our wedding was in our backyard, Ashley took the time to thoughtfully scout out the best locations for family portraits, and her attention to detail beautifully documented the simple but meaningful touches that made the day special. Ashley was also a calming presence throughout. I experienced a significant dress snafu while getting ready, and she gracefully shifted to photographing the men, even reassuring my husband that everything was under control. You would never know from the photos that we were dealing with a wardrobe issue—she captured those moments seamlessly and with such professionalism. We wholeheartedly recommend Ashley. She is talented, down-to-earth, and has an incredible ability to make the wedding day feel easy while delivering timeless images you’ll cherish.

both engagement and wedding photos, and the engagement photos helped us to get to know her better and feel comfortable for the big day. Her approach is more natural and candid, which was what we were looking for, and we incorporated portrait photos as well which are nice to look back on. She had a lot of fun ideas for poses; they were not cookie-cutter. She was also great at taking detail shots. Ashley is very fun, creative and flexible, and she has lots of energy but somehow remains chill at the same time. She is also very organized, on time and has a thorough and professional contract. Her prices are on par with those in the Bay Area, and she offers different packages to choose from. She produced our wedding photos a good two weeks before their estimated due date, which we were thrilled with! It’s been a few months since our wedding and we still often think about Ashley and how it was fun having her be a part of our wedding journey. Thank you Ashley!!

My *now husband* and I are not big picture people, but Ashley made the entire experience magical. I was referred to her from a friend and she responded quickly and professionally. ...

As the day approached I became more and more excited to just give her a hug for being so amazing. Our wedding ceremony was very intimate so it really was just us and Ashley having fun. Her photography direction was organic and easy to follow , it was like hanging out with a friend rather photographer. I really appreciated how creative she was and was willing to work with our ideas but also tell us what wouldn’t work with how the lighting was in the venue. She sent us a sneak peak that night and I was blown away. She captured our family better than I could have imagined. Our venue was at San Francisco city hall so with all the marble and gold I envisioned an ethereal goddess vibe for my picture - and boy did Ashley deliver! My husband and I are so happy with how the pictures turned out. I can’t stop looking at our album and I am excited to work with Ashley again in the future.

rew ideas that were amazing and came out unbelievable! From pre-wedding photo ideas, to actual wedding day and getting shots organized- she was on it. Her quick responsiveness to goings-on and capturing moments at a whim, to reading a room, a moment, capturing calmness and party modes; her skills are unmatched. The teaser previews we received along the way as she touched up photos got us excited to see the final set- and the presentation and organization of the final set is gorgeous; it’s not just a folder of photos- but a time capsule of your day that you get to cherish, and moments you didn’t think happened, are there waiting for you. End of the day, if you don’t hire Ashley- sorry not sorry for your photographer decision. She is, hands down, the queen of photography. Anyone can snap a picture, but a photographer captures the moment, the emotions, the happiness shared, and the love, and presents you a true photograph, not just a picture, and you can relive the memories forever.

es in every photo she takes. We have received so many compliments on how wonderful she made people feel during our wedding. It is not very often that you find a vendor who just fits the pieces together so seamlessly. If we could give Ashley a million stars, we would do so without blinking an eye. Five is just not enough to rate how amazing this woman is to work with! From the bottom of our hearts, Thank You, Ashley...for everything!

We had a great experience with Ashley for our wedding! I generally find it awkward to have professional photographs taken, but she did not make it awkward at all. I had no set list...

of what I wanted her to do, and she provided great ideas for shots we should take. She was kind, fun, and also not obtrusive during the event. We got our photos back very quickly and loved them.

Kristina A. & Andre H. We can't recommend Ashley enough! She captured our wedding day perfectly as well as interacted with the guests and wedding party in a professional and effort...

less manner. What makes Ashley special in our opinion is her style : she has a unique eye and also created some of the most timeless, classical compositions. We look back on our wedding photos and we can remember what a wonderful day it was and how happy we and our family and friends were and that's all we could have wanted and hoped for!

I selected Ashley because she was really easy to talk to, and I knew that if I was going to have to spend my wedding day next to someone (besides my husband) I wanted it to be some...

one that I was comfortable with. Even my husband (who HATES being in front of a camera) had an enjoyable engagement photo session, and Ashley even got him to smile! So great job Ashley!! She was also super patient with me and my OCD, going back and forth with all my questions around colors of photos. She touched up and edited the photos more times than she would have likely cared to, but never made me feel like she was upset or angry with me (even though I'm sure she was not thrilled at all the extra work I was asking for). She was very pleasant to work with and super patient with me, which I really appreciated.

njoyed every minute but still got the pictures we were hoping for. She knew when to steal us away for impromptu pictures and did a great job orchestrating the family and bridal party pictures. When the pictures came back we were impressed that she was able to capture every detail, even the smallest details that ended up meaning so much. We've since used her for maternity photos and most recently to capture our now family of 4. She is a true artist and we can't thank her enough!

Ashley photographeD our wedding in October of 2014. She was so easy going to work with and had a great, positive way about her. Very important on a wedding day! It was the hottest ...

day of the year and she managed to bounce around and captured so many moments. As the bride, I obviously missed so much, so when viewing my photos it was so special to feel like I attended my own wedding. She didn’t miss a thing! And the candids of all my guests are so special to us. The quality of the images are amazing! And she delivered the perfect plump size album. Enough to show she captured every special moment, but not too many that we were overwhelmed. Our ceremony was outdoors in natural light and our reception was inside a dimly lit barn- she nailed every shot! Ashley was simply wonderful to work with. She has photographed our wedding, our growing family and several friends weddings/ and special moments, every photos we see from her is so great!!

ore work than I had anticipated. Hence why I appreciated so much that Ashley is who she is! As a person and a professional. She asked me all the right questions and helped me get organized so that the day came and pictures were smooth. She’s wonderful to talk to and has a great presence. Her photos were all winners (we loved the special moments she captured when we weren’t even looking) And I LOVE the book she made for us. I’m looking forward to photo sessions down the road, maybe babies. Eek!
