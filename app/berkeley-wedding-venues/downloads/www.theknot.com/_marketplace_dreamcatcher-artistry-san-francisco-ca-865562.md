After searching endlessly for the right hair and makeup team—and having a terrible trial with another company—I finally found Dreamcatcher Artistry, and I couldn’t be more grateful...

! From the start, the owner, Leah, was incredibly thoughtful and hands-on. She personally took my call so I could ask detailed questions and make sure they were the right fit, which immediately put me at ease. Leah explained that their mission is to make brides and their wedding parties feel like the best version of themselves—not overly made-up or unrecognizable—which was exactly what I was looking for. She paired me with Adrieanna, one of her longest-standing artists, for my trial, and we had such a fun experience at my apartment. Adrieanna was patient, listened to my ideas, and even took the time to FaceTime my mom so she could be part of the process, which meant so much to me. Right away, I could tell she understood my vision and was bringing it to life beautifully. When Leah told me that she herself would be my second artist on my wedding day, I felt so taken care of. On the big day, both Leah and Adrieanna made me and my bridal party feel comfortable, confident, and absolutely stunning. They enhanced everyone’s natural beauty in a way that felt effortless and elegant. Best of all, the hair and makeup lasted flawlessly the entire day—even after hours of dancing and celebrating! Your hair and makeup team truly sets the tone for the wedding day, and I couldn’t have been more thankful to have Dreamcatcher Artistry by my side. If you want a team that is professional, warm, and unbelievably talented, look no further! Event Date: Sept. 15, 2024

My bridal party and I were all thrilled with how everything turned out. Highly recommend!

I could not have been happier with the service Dreamcatcher provided, from start to finish. After researching endless makeup options for my wedding I decided to go with them becau...

se price was about the same as others but I felt like they offered more. The airbrush foundation and lashes were a big selling point. Plus the reviews made me confident I was making a good choice. And boy was I right. They communicated with me for my trial and the day of so smoothly and promptly. I never felt like I was worried. On the day of my wedding I had 2 artists, Sye and Ashlee. Both were amazing. I had Sye for my trial and she did flawless work so I knew I was in good hands again on the day of. Ashlee was so quick with her hairstyles she had plenty of time for touch ups with my bridesmaids and all their hair looked amazing!! So talented. Sye is an absolute magician with makeup, everyone looked beautiful!! Our timeline was followed so well we actually finished about 20 minutes early. Also worth mentioning, I had my hair/makeup done by 1pm and it lasted till 12am that night. After dancing, a little rain, and going to a bar that night it looked great. I would gladly hire them again or recommend to anyone looking for quality hair/makeup services.

bination of up-do, half up/half down, and curls. I did a trial with Sye and she did my hair (Hollywood glam curls) and makeup (natural) for the wedding and it looked great, it lasted all day, and was exactly what I wanted. I don’t normally wear makeup and Sye did a great job of making it look natural but also elegant. Ashlee did my hair (half up/half down curls) and makeup (natural) for the rehearsal dinner and it was exactly what I wanted. I couldn’t recommend Sye and Ashlee more!

ugh out the entire journey from beginning to end and she was fantastic. Always followed up within the day, she had great communication, the forms to fill out so they know what look you are going for was super easy and helpful. I worked with Sye for my bridal hair and make up for both the trial and the day. My sister make up was also done by Sye, with hair by Kalani. Kalani was our hair stylist for my bridesmaids. I haven't gotten all our pictures back but the day was filled with so many compliments on all our make up and hair. Sye did an incredible job. I was less tan from the summer so I wanted to switch my hair and make up look from the trial, which could be scary the day of but she knocked it out of the park. Sye communication and understanding of what you like about a picture and her professional yet fun and calm presence made the day so easy. I have never felt more pretty than I did on my wedding day. The make up felt so light, my flip pony hair with extensions was a dream. Kalani did all three of my bridesmaids hair that I don't have pictures of yet. But she did a wonderful job, she did two updos. My bridesmaids just said I trust you and she did her thing. We can't recommend booking dreamcatcher enough look no further because they will make your experience easy, fun, memorable, and beautiful.

Nancy did my make up and hair for my October 2025 wedding. Jordan and Nancy also helped my bridal party get their hair and make up done. They were absolutely amazing and patient. ...

For my hair and make up I thought I wanted a soft glam look and an updo. When we did the trial I realized that the look I had envisioned doesn’t work for me. So I HIGHLY recommend doing a trial. Nancy was flexible and patient with my lack of knowledge of hair and make up and made me look beautiful on my wedding day. Nancy and Jordan also did the hair and make up of my mother in law and mother who also don’t know much about hair and make up but both of them were absolutely thrilled with their look. Again both Jordan and nancy were incredibly patient, calm, and helped us move toward hair and make up that made us feel comfortable. Would absolutely recommend, especially if you are gifting hair and make up to your bridal party.

We had some last-minute changes on who was getting hair/makeup , and they took them in stride and were able to put me (a very stressed bride) at ease. Leah really listened to what I wanted, and was super diligent about taking notes before, during, and after the pre-wedding trial. She then implemented everything I asked for on the wedding day. Leah and her team made getting ready so relaxed and fun. The artists were all so personable and a great addition to the bridal suite!! My bridal party looked amazing. Everyone was so comfortable and happy with their looks. Not only did Dreamcatcher Artistry create beautiful looks for the wedding party, but they also did amazing work on my mom, mother-in-law, and grandma. They are truly so skilled for ALL ages. We all felt our best that day, and I cannot thank Leah and the team enough!

I spent so much time researching hair and makeup teams and interviewing them, and I am so glad I went with Dreamcatcher Artistry. I was looking for a natural makeup look, and Leah,...

the business owner, set me up with Sye. From start to finish, working with Leah, Sye, and Chelsea was an absolute joy. I have extremely sensitive skin with a long list of allergens, and Sye took the time to make sure all the makeup used was safe, both during the preview and on the wedding day itself. The preview is a must-have: I had picked a few “Pinterest” makeup and hair looks, and Sye did a great job matching them. Even though the makeup we tried at the preview was nice, it just didn’t look quite right on me. I talked to Sye about it, and she made thoughtful adjustments, creating a final look on the wedding day that I absolutely loved. Besides Sye, we also had Chelsea on the wedding day, and they both did an amazing job on me as well as all the bridesmaids and the wedding party. Some of the girls were quite picky, but everyone was thrilled with their hair and makeup. Sye and Chelsea were professional, attentive, and made everyone feel comfortable. The end result was flawless, and all of us were thrilled. If you want talented artists who truly care about their clients and deliver stunning results, Dreamcatcher Artistry is the team to go with!

rmth, down to earth attitude, and good-humor put me at ease from the start of my hair preview. On the day, Sye showed up bright and early, put some tunes on and got to work. I could go on and on and on about how lovely my friends and I looked and felt after Sye’s magic–the airbrush was cooling and light, the hair pins secure and painless, the eyelashes natural and gorgeous. Somehow, with not a single touch up, everything looked flawless the entire night. The hours before the wedding were filled with emotions, nerves, and tension, and Sye was with me the whole time, helping me through with kind words of encouragement and logistical solutions. She stayed until I was completely dressed and saved the day with last-minute dress tape. Thank you for all the confidence, calm, and beauty on the best night of my life.

A was fantastic. I'm a 60 yo bride and my bride hair looked EXACTLY like my picture I showed her. My soon to be step-daughter and Maid of Honor looked amazing and her hair looked exactly like her pic she showed to the HMUA. My soon to be mother in law (82 yo) had her hair done and it looked great and she was very happy. My sister (Matron of Honor) is 72 years old and her make up was flawless and she was super happy. HMUA was on time, professional, did a great job. Working ahead of time with Leah, the owner, was so easy. She explained everything, she responded to emails quickly. I even added to my services about a month ahead of my wedding and Leah was so gracious about it and easily added it to my contract. She also worked out my timing for the day of the wedding that fit our schedules perfectly. I was given my HMUAs cell phone for the trial and the day-of the wedding. It could not have gone better and could not have asked for more. Thank you Dreamcatcher Artistry for making me feel like a bride and confident at my wedding and for making my girls look amazing!

Dreamcatcher team made the whole process so easy, guiding me through the planning process to think through what I wanted and providing a very clear day-of schedule and preparation list ahead of time. Sye was my artist, and she was so lovely to work with during the trial and on the big day. She made me feel very comfortable during our time together and answered all of my questions. She even helped me plan a second lip color since I had two ceremonies during my wedding. My hair and makeup held up well the entire day, and I loved my look. I wish I could look like that every day! We LOVED all of the artists (Sye, Megan, Kirsten) we worked with. They all came on time and well prepared with everything we could need (including chairs and lights). My mom was having anxiety about getting her HMU done well in advance of the wedding, but Kirsten (yes we shared the same name!) made her feel very comfortable through their conversation. In the end, my mom was super happy with how the look turned out which definitely set a great tone for the day. Everyone looked stunning in the photos (photos attached by Cassie Valente- our photographer)! Definitely recommend Dreamcatcher Artistry for HMU. We’d hire them again in a heartbeat!

pointment for hair and makeup. Adrieanna showed up on time and did a fabulous job of doing my hair and makeup as I wanted. She's very talented. She listens well and if there was anything needing adjusting she happily adjusted it, both on the preview and wedding day. On the morning of my wedding day, Adrieanna showed up on time and ready to make us look our best. She had to do hair and makeup for my Officiant, two bridesmaids, and myself. The ladies looked gorgeous after she finished! While having my makeup done I was feeling a little overwhelmed and teary eyed (happy tears), Adrieanna did a great job at distracting me and reminding me to breathe, she even handed me a fan to give myself some air which helped a lot! I loved my hair and makeup, and it stayed on for the rest of the day even through many happy tears! I’m also thankful she stayed a few extra minutes and helped me with my dress. Whew! All went splendid! She’s wonderful!

I hired Dreamcatcher Artistry for my bridal hair and makeup for my wedding in Santa Barbara. They were AMAZING. We had Adrieanna and Leah and I couldn't say anything more positive ...

about them because they absolutely crushed it. Leah was very communicative from the beginning and was extremely organized. She was very accommodating, helpful and flexible. They helped do 8 different services in a very short time frame on our wedding day in a very tight hotel room and executed everything flawlessly. They listened to the various requests from all of us getting ready and made suer we were happy with the results before they left. They worked around a lot of different skin tones (from pale to dark skin) and lots of different hair types (including extensions) and did so without any issues or complaints! All of us were amazed and very happy with our makeup and hair. I'm so happy with the results - I've seriously never felt prettier thanks to Adrieanna and Leah. I would highly recommend hiring Dreamcatcher Artistry - you will not be disappointed!

I had multiple bridesmaids tell me it was the best wedding party makeup they ever had. I had Sye as my bridal artist, and she knocked it out the park! I have never felt more beautiful. Couldn't have been more impressed with the whole Dreamcatcher team.

I did not find my experience as wonderful as everyone seems to have had. My contract with another company was absorbed by Dreamcatcher Artistry and I soon realized I was paying ext...

ra to a company that is pretty much just a middle person and probably taken a massive cut for another woman's work. I found that I was asked questions and then without disclosure, charged addition fees, which I then contested as it should never have been additional costs. I felt like this company looks to nickel and dime it's clients, which seems a bit cheap considering I was already paying a couple thousand dollars just three women for hair and makeup, one little girl for hair, and for my husband to basically have his hair brushed/styled. I am happy to pay well for good service, but do not appreciate when it is done in a dishonest way. When it came to scheduling, I was not very impressed by the effort to be proactive in making a pretty simple schedule request work so I could make it for my first look timing. Luckily, I was able to suggest a solution since the response I previous got was no help at all. Overall, I wish I had known how this worked and had found a makeup artist to contract with directly. The makeup artist herself was fantastic. Star deductions have nothing to do with the quality of the artist, who I was happy to additionally tip for her work. My advise to women contracted to Dreamcatcher is to be your own advocate and know when you are getting ripped off.

Response from Dreamcatcher Artistry on 08/19/2024

Lindsay, thank you for your feedback. I’m truly sorry to hear that your experience with ou...

r company didn’t meet your expectations. We strive to ensure every bride has a wonderful experience, and it’s disheartening to learn that we fell short in your case. I tried reaching out to you by phone followed by two emails last week to discuss your concerns directly, as I believe open communication is the best way to resolve any issues. We even sent a followup email a few weeks after your wedding as we do with all of our brides to see how everything went, with no response. Based on our previous correspondence, we were unaware of the extent of your concerns beyond the request to waive the room change fee. I’d like to address some of your specific points in hopes of clarifying any misunderstandings. As you know, Dreamcatcher Artistry acquired Rozetree Bridal earlier this year. We honored everything in your original contract with Rozetree. However, when you added additional services that were not offered by Rozetree, there were additional costs involved. We always aim to be transparent about our pricing, but I understand that since your initial booking was with Rozetree, you may not have been fully aware of these details. We did our best to inform you of any extra costs as soon as we began working on the additional services you requested. It’s never our intention to add unexpected fees, and we genuinely try to be upfront and clear about all costs. Regarding the scheduling concerns, we always strive to be as flexible as possible. When you requested a time change, your artist already had another commitment that morning. While she did her best to accommodate the new timing, it was unfortunately beyond our control. We did try to keep the conversation open asking for you and your coordinators thoughts on the matter, as we always aim to find the best outcome for everyone involved. We understand how important timing is on your wedding day and regret that this caused you any stress. I also want to highlight that we are proud of the compensation rates we offer our talented artists. Fees like the room change fee are in place to ensure our artists are fairly compensated for the additional time and effort required for tasks such as setup, teardown, and sanitation. As an artist myself, I’ve worked with teams that didn’t value my time, and our policies are designed to ensure fair treatment and compensation for everyone on our team. Lastly, I want to mention that we provided two artists for your event without charging an additional travel fee, as I specifically wanted to avoid any unnecessary costs for you. Again, I am deeply sorry that your experience with us wasn’t what you hoped for. I would have appreciated the opportunity to discuss this with you personally, as we are a hardworking, family-owned business dedicated to creating the best possible experience for our brides and providing meaningful work for our artists. If there’s anything we can do to make this right, please don’t hesitate to reach out.

I asked if we could add an additional artist, but was told we could only add a second one if I purchased ten services. With the early hour fees, it was almost as expensive to add the second artist, so I gifted makeup services to my Maid of Honor and Matron of Honor.

Nancy helped with hair and make-up for the women in our family the day of the wedding, and everyone seemed happy with the results. Everyone’s make-up and hair lasted from the morning until the afterparty, easily. Dreamcatcher typically will match you with whichever artists are free for your event, so I really recommend requesting the name of the artist and their portfolio before booking! Many of them have different styles.

Nora and Steven did hair and makeup for my sisters-in-law, my sister, my mother, and me. They both did a fantastic job and everyone looked beautiful! Nora especially went above and beyond the call of duty. I completely changed my mind about the look between my preview and my wedding day, and she handled it like a total champ!! She did a STUNNING job on my hair and makeup, and she was so incredibly kind to me during probably the most stressful few hours of my life. She literally helped me figure out how to put in my contacts (I never wear them) and stepped in to help button my dress when my mom was having a hard time due to arthritis in her thumbs. I had her stay for a few extra hours for touch ups (HIGHLY recommend - she touched me up right before I walked down the aisle and then again right before photos, so I didn't have to think twice about how I looked at any point).

She worked with me step by step with such patience the morning of to ensure that I nailed the look I was going for. Everyone looked amazing and they couldn't believe how natural the airbrush looked and how each artist helped them achieve what they were asking for! I was so calm all morning because I knew I was in such great hands. Our makeup looked great all night long needling no touch-ups. I could not believe I looked the exact same by the end of the night having been on the dance floor the whole time.
