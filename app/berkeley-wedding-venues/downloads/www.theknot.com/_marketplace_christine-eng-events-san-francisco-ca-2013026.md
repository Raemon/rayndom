Christine

Wedding Coordinator

Ever since I was a flower girl (age 5!), I've always been involved in weddings.If I wasn't asked to be a bridesmaid, pianist, or a speaker at the reception, I was the coordinator. And during that time, I noticed two things: 1. Bridal couples often ask a cousin or a good friend to coordinate, and that person never gets to enjoy the benefits of being a guest! 2. I love planning details, right down to the timing. I love making sure the bridal couple feels like they hosted the wedding they've always dreamed of, and at the end of the night, I want them to walk away overjoyed from their celebration.

Christine is, without question, the best wedding coordinator—and we say this with confidence because we ended up hiring two during our planning process. We had just three months t...

o plan a wedding for 85 guests, so we knew we needed someone who was highly detailed, organized, and extremely responsive. We interviewed five coordinators and immediately connected with Christine. However, based on a friend’s recommendation, we initially hired a different company. Deep down, I had a gut feeling it wasn’t the right fit—and unfortunately, that feeling proved to be correct. One month later, we terminated that contract, and thankfully, Christine was available. From day one, the difference in service was unmistakable. Christine’s attention to detail and the care she put into every aspect of our wedding were truly priceless. She didn’t just coordinate vendors—she became a steady source of guidance and moral support. She went above and beyond her scope, helping ensure things like our wedding bands and attire were delivered on time, which gave us immense peace of mind. From the day we first contacted her, she always responded within 30 minutes which was so reassuring for my anxious personality. At the rehearsal, she made sure we felt confident and knew exactly what to do. On the wedding day itself, she was nothing short of superwoman—from start to finish. The timeline she created was incredibly detailed, and she kept everything running smoothly and on schedule without ever causing stress for us or our guests. Because of Christine, we were able to fully enjoy our day, knowing every detail was being handled by a true professional. I highly recommend her to anyone who wants a seamless, stress-free, and beautifully executed wedding day. If you're looking for a coordinator, I encourage you to connect with her and I'm sure the interaction with her will speak for itself.

ce. After sharing my vision (and budget) for the lunch with Christine, she found the perfect restaurant, secured a private room for us, and coordinated the menu with the restaurant. Christine also shared her expertise and provided me with suggestions for place cards and favors. Every guest commented on how enjoyable the afternoon was. Christine translated my vision for the lunch to perfection. One of my guests was so impressed by Christine that she asked for her business card for a future event. I was able to thoroughly enjoy the lunch and my friends’ company because Christine’s attention to detail and coordination made it so all I had to do was show up on the day. If you want an event that your guests rave about long after it ends, do yourself a favor — hire Christine.

My now-wife and I hired Christine as a wedding coordinator for our wedding in Sonoma, and there are many reasons you should consider her too! While I absolutely loved the venue an...

d would pick it again if I could redo it, the venue did have a lot of detailed requirements and was quite strict about enforcing them. We had already booked the venue and the date before we hired Christine, and it became clear over time that we couldn't have handled all the logistical challenges and communication without someone attentive and responsive like Christine. Early on in planning, neither my wife nor I had a clear vision of what we wanted, and it was only 3-4 months before the wedding date we really understood what we wanted. We wanted a custom dessert bar with a very specific selection of outside vendors, timeline, and the physical arrangement, and Christine helped make that happen with ease. My best men were the ones picking up and delivering the dessert items, and Christine made sure to communicate with them directly on the week prior and the day of the wedding, and even took care of how we were going to store dairy items with the limited fridge space. In the last couple of months prior to the wedding, she created a very, very detailed timeline for the day of, with clear instructions for each member of the wedding party, whom she shared the schedule with directly as well. We did request a last minute change in schedule and she revised it and realigned with all the vendors in a matter of days. The biggest stress happened 2 weeks before the wedding. We were expecting a warm, sunny, and pleasant weather based on historical data, but we learned that a heatwave was coming to Sonoma: 98 degrees at the outdoor ceremony time. We panicked and were super worried, and Christine recommended 2 things, which we later learned made a world of difference for our guests: parasols and hand fans. They were an affordable, small addition that was so effective and also made the ceremony photos incredibly unique and stunning. Now for the actual wedding day. It was not 98 degrees but it was still quite warm. Christine ran around all day orchestrating the vendors, corralling guests and all. Several guests of ours were so impressed with how effective she was at running the show. She designated a corraller for each group photo after the ceremony, and had them all lined up, which allowed us to finish ~7 group photos in 10 minutes. At the end of the night, Christine was the last one to leave the venue. My wife, I and the wedding party left the venue around 11:30pm after packing everything up, and she was still busy making sure all was well. We actually forgot to say goodbye in person amidst the chaos, and ended up doing a facetime a couple days later to reminisce and say our goodbyes. Our wedding was the best day of my life yet (and my wife's too), and dozens of our guests have told us it was their favorite wedding, which makes all the hard work worth it. And I know that Christine was a crucial part of what made that possible. Whatever your vision is (or the lack thereof), I think you'll be pleased with what Christine has to offer, on arguably one of the most important days of your life.

Christine was an absolute DREAM to work with! Words can’t truly capture how incredible she is, both as a person and as a wedding coordinator. We hired her just six days after getti...

ng engaged, and for the next year and a half, she guided us through every step of the planning process with patience, organization, and genuine care. From the start, Christine kept us on track with a clear timeline and manageable to-do lists, ensuring that every detail was accounted for. She created a phenomenal, ultra-detailed day-of itinerary that saved the day. Even when we fell behind early on (thanks to unexpected delays), we still ended up ahead of schedule! Her sense of timing and coordination is truly unmatched. Every single vendor we hired came through Christine’s trusted network. My dream dress came from a boutique she recommended! She connects you with the best in the industry, and somehow manages to keep everything within budget. After meeting each vendor, my husband and I couldn’t stop saying, “We seriously have the best team ever!” And on our wedding day, that proved to be so true. Every vendor was professional, kind, and reassuring, keeping me calm and confident that we were right on schedule. Christine’s professionalism and communication skills were top-notch throughout the entire process. She was quick to respond via email or text, always followed up on open items, and made sure we were fully in the loop. If you want a stress-free, joyful, and perfectly organized wedding planning experience, hire Christine! You will not regret it for one second. We’re already planning to work with some of her amazing vendors again for future events and photoshoots. Our family and friends are still talking about how our wedding was THE event of the year! Christine, thank you for everything. We’re endlessly grateful for you and all that you did to make our day unforgettable. We love you! :)

ding favors or my gift for my mother-in-law, Christine was always there to bounce ideas around and help me figure out what really mattered to us. She seamlessly coordinated with all our vendors and the friends and family who were helping throughout the day, which meant we could actually relax and enjoy ourselves instead of worrying about logistics. What I appreciated most was how she truly listened to what was important to us. We told her we wanted time to actually eat our dinner and enjoy it without being rushed, and she built the schedule to make that happen. She kept all our priorities top of mind and executed them flawlessly. I can't recommend her enough.

ssful process feel effortless and joyful. Christine's vendor recommendations were absolutely stellar. She found us a spectacular restaurant that not only served incredible food that had our guests raving, but also worked beautifully within our budget – something we'd been struggling to find on our own. When my wife needed hair and makeup services, Christine connected us with a stylist who made her look and feel absolutely radiant on our big day. What truly set Christine apart was her meticulous attention to detail. She crafted a comprehensive timeline for our wedding day and orchestrated every moment flawlessly. Nothing was left to chance, yet everything felt natural and unhurried. She anticipated needs before they arose and handled any minor hiccups so seamlessly that we never even knew they happened. The peace of mind Christine provided was priceless. We were able to be fully present and savor every moment of our celebration, knowing that she had everything under control. Our wedding day was absolutely perfect, and we owe so much of that perfection to her expertise, dedication, and genuine care for making our day special. If you're considering hiring a wedding planner, look no further. Whether you come to her with a fully-formed vision that needs flawless execution, or you're still figuring out what you want and need someone to guide you through the possibilities, Christine will make your wedding everything you've imagined and more. We are forever grateful and recommend her without reservation.

rty & Christine was the mastermind bringing it all together. There were multiple venue issues including access, technical, lighting and plumbing. There were delays causing kitchen delays, and a very anxious, near-panicked host. Christine handled it all with ease and professionalism, with a firm hand and the quick thinking that only experience can earn. She connected with the vendors the same way she did with the host and guests; with friendly assurance, kindness and gratitude. Without a doubt, this could have gone poorly if the day was in the wrong hands, but fortunately for all of us in attendance, it was a beautiful & memorable event, with big smiles all around. I couldn’t be more impressed!

Christine is phenomenal — truly a gem in Bay Area event planning! We planned our wedding from across the country, and Christine was the support system we didn’t know we needed. Fro...

m the moment we met her, we felt completely at ease. She immediately began connecting us with vendors that matched our style, budget, and vibe — and made planning from afar not only possible but enjoyable. We started planning about year and a half before our wedding, with only a venue booked (which is how we discovered Christine — she was highly recommended on the preferred vendor list). During our very first consultation, we knew she was the one. She genuinely believed in our vision and was ready to bring it to life right from the start. Her energy, dedication, and passion were clear from day one. Throughout the entire planning process, Christine was communicative, responsive, and always a step ahead. Even from across the country, we felt supported and cared for. She brought invaluable insight and guidance, especially when we faced decisions we weren’t sure about. Her enthusiasm never wavered, and she made us feel like we were her top priority the whole time. Christine truly went above and beyond — especially when unexpected changes arose. Just two weeks before the big day, we had to switch officiants, which required reworking parts of the ceremony. Christine handled it all with grace and efficiency, coordinating the changes so everything ran seamlessly. On the wedding day, she made sure everything was about us. We didn’t have to worry about a single thing. One moment we’ll never forget: Christine physically stood in front of the donut wall to make sure we got the first pick before guests dove in. We are beyond grateful for everything Christine did to make our wedding not only beautiful but stress-free. If you're planning a wedding or event in the Bay Area, we wholeheartedly recommend her!

She scouted the perfect location and introduced us to an incredible team of vendors—including our photographer and videographer—using her deep connections not just in the Bay Area but also in SoCal. What really stood out about Christine was not just her expertise and organization, but the way she fully supported and encouraged us throughout the entire process. She took the time to truly understand who we are as a couple and made sure that every decision felt authentic to us. She never pushed us toward anything that didn’t feel right—instead, she encouraged us to stay true to ourselves and helped create a wedding that felt genuinely ours. She was an excellent communicator and always made sure we felt informed and prepared. Planning a destination wedding comes with extra logistics, and she handled everything seamlessly—coordinating with vendors, keeping us on track, and ensuring that even from afar, we felt confident and stress-free. Whether it was brainstorming ideas, problem-solving, or just offering reassurance when things felt overwhelming, Christine was there every step of the way. She also ran our rehearsal flawlessly, making sure everyone knew exactly what to do, which made a huge difference in keeping things smooth and stress-free on the wedding day. And despite the short timeline, she made sure every detail was thoughtfully planned and executed perfectly. Not only did we love working with Christine, but all of my bridesmaids raved about her too! She kept everything organized, made sure everyone felt included, and just had such a great energy throughout the day. I can’t recommend Christine enough! The fact that she pulled everything together for our destination wedding in just six months speaks volumes about her skill, dedication, and professionalism. If you’re looking for a planner who is organized, supportive, and truly invested in making your day special, Christine is the one. We’re so grateful for everything she did to make our wedding unforgettable!

We cannot even begin to express how lucky we were to have gotten Christine as our wedding planner and coordinator. We had our wedding in SF City Hall on December 19. She has made...

the wedding planning experience so seamless and memorable for us. She is very approachable from the get go and an excellent communicator. During the planning process she was always clarifying or giving suggestions when we were not clear on which direction to go. She valued our culture, tradition, but most importantly she valued what we wanted as a couple. She was such a strong support system. I (bride) unfortunately had lost a family member a month before the wedding and it took a big toll on us during the wedding planning but Christine was there to help facilitate a lot of the communication so I can take a break to grieve. On the day of the wedding she made sure that everything ran smoothly, always available to provide reassurance to calm some of the wedding anxiety. Our wedding was the closest thing we will ever have to a perfect evening and I know Christine and our other vendors worked very hard to make that happen. We actually sort of miss wedding planning and working with Christine! We highly recommend her services if you are looking for a wedding planner.

Planning a wedding is so complex and involves so many moving pieces that there are always bumps along the way, but so much of what went well about our wedding was due to Christine!...

We reached out to Christine early in our wedding planning process and ended up hiring her for full planning services. Her experience in vendor selection and her flexibility in communication were some of the main factors in our decision. We didn't have many friends or family who have gotten married in the area, so being able to work from her shortlist of trusted vendors simplified our search so much. She helped us prioritize which ones to book first, and we really enjoyed all of the vendors she recommended, some of which we would have had no idea of without her! Additionally, her flexibility in working async with us over email and text was incredible. We were often doing planning after our own work hours, and no matter how late it was, Christine was always online with a prompt reply. The true testament to Christine's skills came around the 3-month mark before our wedding. This was when all of the coordination and logistics came into play, and it was clear this is Christine's strong suit. She put together a comprehensive timeline and made sure to go over so many of the small details with us to ensure it was what we wanted. She also handled communications with all of our vendors to hash out all of their needs, which was so great not to have to worry about on our end! All of her meticulous planning and coordination allowed us to enjoy our wedding day without worry. Luckily nothing unexpected came up, but if it had, we felt having Christine was like having an insurance policy or safety net, knowing she was there to handle any unforeseen issues like a pro. We’re truly grateful that working with Christine allowed us to enjoy our special day to the fullest!

Christine was awesome to work with for our wedding in San Francisco. From our first call, she was giving us ideas on how to handle the timeline of the wedding day in case we had a ...

long gap between the ceremony and reception. These two themes carried through the entire planning process - she was always great at providing ideas for us to personalize our wedding day, and when we thought we had to cancel our photographer, she was so quick to reach out to some people she knew. We felt really taken care of by Christine. In the weeks leading up to the wedding, she was super diligent on putting together a timeline. As a big planner myself, this made me feel at ease and also helped me to really get an image of what the day would start to look like, as well as start to make granular decisions about things we may or may not want to add. On the day of, she was perfectly protective of us to make sure that we were having a great time and not bothered by logistics.

isappointed. We had Christine coordinate our wedding, which normally would be such a stressful planning period. However, with Christine's help, the entire process was fun, low-stress and so easy. Christine recommended vendors whenever we were in need, came up with amazing ideas for our wedding, and took care of major issues without us asking! For example, on our wedding day, there were some issues with broken doors at our venue. Without hesitation, Christine tackled the issue for us so that we could continue our beautiful wedding day without having to worry. We appreciate her help and our wedding day would truly not be what it was without her! Furthermore, Christine is great with people. She was able to handle our HUGE wedding party for wedding rehearsals, helped our friend get ordained as our minister, and coordinated all our vendors with ease. Christine made sure we were always taken care of and were not stressed by anything on our wedding day. She went way above and beyond what she needed to do. We have already recommended her highly to all our friends and family and hope you will do the same. Even our entire wedding party and our guests who had the pleasure of meeting Christine spoke highly of her and her organization! Do yourself a favor and reach out. We promise you will not regret it. She will definitely execute your event perfectly.

From florists, catering, event decor, and graphic design elements to the hair and makeup team, Christine works with amazing folks who help co-create memorable and bespoke events.

Her organized email threads and Google Docs are a testament to her expert project management skills. At junctures where we were undecided or struggling to make decisions, Christine offered guidance drawing on her decades of experience. Christine truly cares about and celebrates each couple and their families. She is responsive to cultural considerations from decor to ceremony design to the reception food menu. She was so responsive that we would often tell her to stop responding to us at 1 or 2am. Should we have any event planning needs in the future, we will be sure to use Christine. Any Bay Area couple seeking out a wedding planner would be remiss not to work with Christine.

She pointed us to great and affordable vendors which we never would’ve found otherwise; her recommendations for DJ, cake and photo booth were perfect. Because she was familiar with our venue, she had a great vision for what our wedding could look like and suggestions for how to get there. When the weekend of our wedding arrived, not only did she take the time to talk through things and reduce our stress, she also managed the vendors and interfaced with the venue staff to make sure everything went perfectly. Despite all that, she still found the time to take some great pictures, and we received the first video of our first dance from her!

d knew that it would all come together in the end. There is so much work involved in planning a wedding and Christine made this a smooth process. She knew so many little details and tips and tricks, there was no way we would have thought of half of the things she suggested. The pace of planning was reasonable and Christine handles the process like a project manager considering dependancies and milestones to keep us on track without a log jam of tasks leading into the day of. The consistent reminders to make decisions and do some homework helped us from going crazy in the final two months. She helped us identify some really great vendors that fit our needs and preferences and then handled a good portion of the communication with our vendors to get quotes, manage follow up, and ask questions. Beyond all of this Christine was very much aware of and sensitive to the cultural elements that we needed to include in our day. She helped us navigate some challenges in balancing out time, budget, and preferences and provided the tools we needed. Several family members and friends have made comments like “Best wedding ever” and “wedding of the century” and we could not have pulled it off without Christine’s help. We even wished that we could have attended our own wedding as guests! At the end of the day, it was a great event and we could not imagine planning the wedding without Christine.

What can we say about Christine that hasn’t already been said!? Our 14-month journey with Christine was an absolute blessing. We initially ranked her last on our list of options ...

based on online info only, and we only took a call with her because we ended up having reservations about our other options. That short phone consultation changed the game and it quickly revealed her unmatched passion for weddings and her intense commitment to her couples, thus making her the obvious choice. From our first interaction to the days even after the wedding, Christine's infectious spirit made the whole process that much more enjoyable. Her professionalism and years of experience were highly valuable. From countless late night emails, a bazillion timeline tweaks (our fault, heh!), to her unwavering support - hiring Christine was THE key factor is our successful wedding. She became not just our coordinator but a true champion for us, guiding us through logistics and always prioritizing our interests. Our family and friends were impressed by how smoothly the day went and we of course have to credit her magic touch. She handles every detail and every problem with grace but is firm when she needs to be. Her name WeddEng BOSS is an extremely accurate description of her work ethic. Whenever she was around or involved it was like a breath of fresh air! Choosing Christine was investing in someone who made our vision a reality. In the end, Christine's efforts didn't just help create the happiest day of our lives but also gave us memories for a lifetime. We are forever grateful to her and wish her continued success!!

Before we found Christine, choosing a wedding coordinator was just another item to check off from our to-do list. We even considered doing the planning ourselves (thank goodness we...

didn’t!). Little did we know that Christine would be utterly essential to our whole experience and our best investment. Even as “just” a partial coordinator, she started helping us shape our vision a year in advance. Through a steady stream of thoughtful emails and texts, she uncovered gaps in our decision-making and guided our thinking about the experience we wanted both for ourselves and our guests. With her help, we finalized our timeline and decisions well in advance of the big day, which is not the norm for procrastinators like us! The wedding was a massive success (multiple guests referred to it as the best wedding they had been to), and we credit so much of that to Christine. In addition to having an immense wealth of knowledge, Christine is also a master communicator. Every other vendor we worked with raved about her organization and professionalism in her outreach. One of the biggest challenges of wedding planning is coordinating between multiple vendors, especially when there are dependencies between them. Luckily we had Christine as our maestra, and our vendors knew exactly what they had to do and when they needed to do it on the big day. Finally, Christine is a consummate cheerleader. In an industry notorious for lack of transparency and inconsistent communication, Christine was truly always there for us. She answered our questions thoroughly, broke down daunting tasks into manageable to-dos, and helped us feel excited about our vision. She treated our families with the same kindness, respect, and enthusiasm. Given the amazing experience we had with Christine, we plan to stay in touch with her and hire her for future celebrations. If you’re thinking about hiring Christine, we urge you to end your search and just do it. You (and your lucky guests) will thank yourself later!

rsation was the importance she placed on family - we had our reception at a Chinese restaurant, and bonded with Christine over the fact that our (picky) parents approved of and loved this venue. It gave us comfort that she was familiar with the manager and location. It’s clear that Christine comes with years of experience — she is always asking thoughtful questions, but is never pushy or too strong with her opinions or suggestions. I consider myself an intense planner and detail-oriented person, and Christine consistently matched (and often exceeded) my energy and expectations. I was hesitant about the necessity of a coordinator for our small 86 person event, but it was the best decision we made for our special day and worth every dollar. It was a stressful period, but we truly felt like we could show up and be taken care of every step of the way. She was constantly in contact with all our vendors and never missed a beat. Christine was professional, prompt, organized, and firm when she needed to be to keep the entire day on track. She helped us have the wedding of our dreams and I will be forever grateful. She feels like a dear friend now, and I would use her again in a heart beat. I wholeheartedly recommend her to anyone who needs a coordinator that they would trust with their lives!

The restaurant provided a Bluetooth speaker, allowing us to play music that enhanced the overall experience. The evening went smoothly and I would hire Christine again in a heartbeat.

Christine is an ABSOLUTE and consummate professional! Trust me when I say that she went above and beyond our own expectations with every single detail about our wedding. From start...

to finish, we could not have had our dream wedding without her level of attention to detail. That is one of her traits that makes her so special. She will make sure that she understands your vision of what you want to happen and will come up with a game plan to make it happen. She was with us every step of the way from booking all of our vendors all the way up to the day after to explain the aftermath of our wedding. With close to 300 people, so many things could have gone wrong on the day of our wedding, but did we know about any of it? Not ONE detail. Christine made sure that our focus was on each other and that we enjoyed every moment of our wedding. Apparently one thing after another was not going as planned and Christine handled it gracefully and without a hitch. There was even a moment in our wedding where it could have been a total disaster, but Christine remained patient, calm, and collected which was exactly what we needed at the time. There was never a time where she wasn't accessible for a quick question (which there were hundreds) and there were times we were even having full on text conversations at 2am! Overall, Christine is just the best and I would not recommend any other coordinator! You would be lucky to have her as a part of your special day. 1000/10 would highly recommend.

We worked with Christine to plan our wedding in May of this year in the Sonoma area. From our first phone call with her I was impressed by her organizational skills and her commitm...

ent to making our day just how we wanted it. As the wedding approached she kept us on track with lots of check-ins while working behind the scenes with our vendors to make sure everyone was on the same page. Planning a wedding can definitely feel overwhelming, but having Christine on our side making sure we didn't miss anything was incredibly helpful. When the big day arrived we were feeling confident that everything would go smoothly - and it did! The flow of the day was very natural thanks to the detailed planning that Christine had helped us with in advance. Our guests had an a amazing time, we got so many beautiful photos, and we really felt that our preferences were taken into account so that our personality as a couple shined through. We would definitely recommend working with Christine for wedding or other event planning - she is a great person to have on your side and you can trust her to not overlook any details! Thanks Christine for all of your help and support!

We had the pleasure of working with Christine as our wedding planner, and we can confidently say that she exceeded all our expectations. Her meticulous and execution-oriented appro...

ach aligned perfectly with what we needed and wanted in a wedding planner. Being a person who tends to worry about every little detail, having Christine by our side was an absolute blessing. She paid close attention to every aspect of our wedding and asked insightful questions about things we hadn't even considered, like table settings, escort cards, and even incorporating essential Chinese and Jewish elements that were deeply meaningful to us. Plus she knew our venue really well, which helped immensely in our planning process. One of the standout aspects of Christine's services was the immaculate schedule she put together for us. No detail was left behind, and she left no stone unturned. We genuinely collaborated on every aspect, and her minute-by-minute schedule not only brought clarity to us but also to our families. It was a game-changer in terms of organization and coordination. As the big day drew near, Christine's expertise truly shone through. During the last few weeks of wedding planning, she was effectively "on call," providing support and guidance whenever we needed it. During the rehearsal and wedding day, as things started to get a bit stressful, Christine's presence was invaluable. She took charge in guiding us through each step, ensuring that both my husband and I, along with the cantor/officiant and our parents, knew exactly what to do. I knew we were all nervous, and having her guide us really calmed our nerves! On the actual wedding day, Christine's dedication and attentiveness was so special. She took care of everything, allowing us to fully enjoy our special day without worrying about any logistical or coordination issues. With weddings often passing in a whirlwind, Christine kept us on track, and we felt incredibly well taken care of throughout the day. She made sure that we were the stars of the show while ensuring our guests felt welcome and appreciated. Selecting Christine as your wedding planner will undoubtedly be a delightful decision. She is a true professional who puts her clients' needs first and foremost. Her ability to understand and execute our vision flawlessly made our wedding day an unforgettable experience. We wholeheartedly recommend Christine to any couple looking for a top-notch wedding planner who will go above and beyond to make your special day truly magical!!

Christine is the consummate professional! Having her on your team means having peace of mind through a joyous yet sometimes stressful process. We hired Christine based on the rec...

ommendation of our wedding venue, and in doing so we hired a coach to guide us through a somewhat complicated process, and a champion who advocated for us and put our interests first. We showed up for our wedding weekend and genuinely did not have to think about anything beyond enjoying our time with our guests, and following Christine's directions. We hired Christine for partial services, but the value we received far exceeded what we expected. She provided recommended vendors based on our budget requirements, as well as advice on what to ask for. About 2 months before, we had our onsite walkthrough, where we established the schedule of the day. From there, Christine worked with the vendors and with us to hone the schedule down to the minute. She then enforced it, so everyone was where they were supposed to be, and the day went as planned! If it didn't, I have no idea because she handled it, she made the process smooth, and most importantly as the couple, she put our experience of the day first. To say our wedding was a success is an understatement, and we have Christine to thank for it! 10/10 completely recommend.

Weddings are tough to plan and it is not made easier with jobs and everyday commitments. We knew this going into it and as a result, talked to four different wedding planners and d...

eliberated carefully. Ultimately, Christine impressed us with her professionalism, track record, and sincerity. Working with Christine was one of the most impactful choices we made during our planning phase and the success of our big day is largely attributed to her. She worked with us from the very beginning of our wedding planning and it was easy to tell that she was highly experienced. She provided vendor recommendations, input for decisions we needed to make, and helped us form a timeline with all of our needs in place. One particular need that we had to accomodate for was fitting in a Chinese tea ceremony somewhere among all the busy events that day, but Christine came up with a plan and all of our concerns were put at rest. Throughout the entire process, she was responsive, proactive, and amazingly detail oriented. Our vendors and wedding party were highly impressed with the level of detail and thought that went into her timeline. Aside from all of the normal wedding planning aspects of things, Christine is an even better person and that showed itself when we had a huge hurdle to overcome when we needed to unexpectedly cancel and reschedule the original wedding plans two days before the date. When we were in no condition to think properly, Christine was able to take action quickly and communicate with all of our vendors and the venue. The result was a successful rescheduling with all of our original vendors. Throughout this time when we felt admittedly pretty devastated, Christine was there supporting us emotionally and taking care of all the logistics that go behind a last minute wedding rescheduling. At the end of the day, the results speak for themselves and our big day was a great success. Our wish was to enjoy the day without having to stress the little things, and Christine made that wish come true. All of our family and friends commented on how smoothly everything went and we kept telling them that we had a great planner. We knew nothing about wedding planning heading into this, but we were guided by the best in Christine. It was an absolute pleasure working with her and getting to know her - at the end it felt like working with a friend. Christine will always have our support and we cannot thank her enough for everything she did for us.

My wife and I couldn’t be more thrilled to have worked with Christine as our month-of/day-of wedding coordinator. We work full-time jobs, and one of our fears was that we would be ...

behind on something. Christine’s experience and communication skills were invaluable to keeping us on track. She was deliberate and thorough in ensuring that we had thought about everything that we needed to by asking detail-oriented questions frequently and well ahead of deadlines. Perhaps most importantly, she would think for us when we were occupied with our day jobs, and therefore outright unable to make all of the considerations that we needed about our wedding. Without her in-the-background efforts, I’m certain we would have had a stressful lead up to the big day. To us, transparency means being able to get answers to our questions. For our wedding, we already had a vision for what we wanted, but we needed Christine to help fill in some gaps. We asked Christine for suggestions for vendors, and when we asked about why she recommended them and what made them special, she was clear with her reasoning. This gave us confidence in moving forward with selecting those vendors. Christine also put together our wedding timeline, including the schedule and details for the rehearsal and the wedding day. She shared this via Google-Docs and opened the entire thing up for us to make comments and to discuss every item well ahead of schedule. When the big day came, we were not surprised by anything because Christine kept us involved throughout the process. We are organized people, which extends to budget planning. With Christine, she was clear about her fees, and when she put her contract together it was easy to read and understand. There were no questions about what services we were paying for. A wedding is a big event, and we had many vendors who all had their own schedules and availability. We found that the most frustrating part was when we needed to address an issue or ask a question, some of our vendors were not responsive. Christine was not one of those vendors - she was available at every instance that we needed her. As our wedding approached, we realized that there was a slight possibility of rain. We did not have a rainy-day plan in place, so we tried to organize a meeting between a number of the vendors who would be key in coming up with a contingency plan. The only responsive vendor was Christine, who worked hard in those last few days to reach the unresponsive vendors on our behalf and convey our concerns and to elicit a response. In all other aspects of communication - asking for her advice, making requests for help, further communicating with vendors, etc. - Christine’s record with us was impeccable. Gameday: This was perhaps the most stand-out aspect of Christine’s work. On the wedding day, we never at any point felt lost about what we needed to do next. It’s not an understatement to say that you will have practically no time to yourself on the wedding day, and we can attest to that. We literally would not have any time to think about “what comes next” in terms of where we needed to be and when. Fortunately, that wasn’t an issue because of Christine. She managed all of the vendors, corralled our designated helper-guests, and directed us all night. All we had to do was follow directions. Though we were busy every minute of the wedding, because of Christine’s guidance we were never overwhelmed, and had just enough time and energy to enjoy our special day.

Christine was a magnificent wedding planner! We had some vague ideas for our wedding, but did not know all the intricate details that were involved. Thankfully, Christine was there...

to guide us. She had a network of vendors to refer us to and threw in recommendations we never knew existed. Christine was always available to answer any questions that we had and provided emotional support when we didn't know we needed it. On the day of the wedding, Christine took care of every detail and made contingency plans when there were last minute changes. We could not have had so much fun at our wedding without her. She ensured the timeline was executed, everyone was accounted for, and closing out the wedding was a success. We highly recommend Christine's services!

fit for us while planning our destination wedding from across the U.S. What I remember most about the planning time were the long conversations Christine and I had to understand our vision and to hammer down those essential first details. Having decided to sign up for month-of coordination services only, I was frankly surprised by how much we talked and figured out together then. Looking back, I will absolutely recollect those moments as the foundations of how much we enjoyed our wedding day-- we were supported by a planner with true grit, expert knowledge and great communication. During the actual week, of course were there were some hurdles that required flexibility from our wedding party, and I loved the way Christine melded with our family/friend groups to resolve those challenges. Last but not least, I want to highlight that I felt very secure with Christine's representation with all our vendors. We went with a few of her recommended vendors, who were excellent in their own right, but trusting her with vendors that were new to both of us came easy.

She would often pop in to ask us a big list of questions or have us make a few decisions, which can feel a bit daunting at first, but we knew were absolutely necessary things to consider. Honestly we’re so thankful for her to bring these topics up because we probably wouldn’t have thought of it until it was too late! We also appreciated that she was always willing to listen to what we had in mind, and never made us feel pressured to have to go a certain way. She did an amazing job keeping us feeling supported at all times during any road bump along the way. On the big day, she worked hard behind the scenes keeping us on schedule and taking care of any issues that came up so that we can enjoy our special day. All in all, we connected so well with Christine and can’t recommend her enough!
