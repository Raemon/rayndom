Paige was a delight to work with for our wedding this past September. Not only was she capable at handling anything that came at her, before, during, and after the wedding, but she...

was also doing important work to set us at ease during a complicated and stressful time. She created an amazing experience for the both of us and it is simple to say that the Savoir team was the key to success for our wedding. A few things that particularly stood out to us was how halfway during the planning process, life got very busy and we started having a hard time making decisions. At one point, we were trying to choose between four different layouts, and Paige gently guided us towards what ended up being the correct choice. When we were deciding the drink situation, we didn't understand the difference between different bar packages that our caterer offered. She educated us and helped us make the right choice financially. All of the vendors she recommended knocked it out of the park. You could tell everyone enjoyed working with her team and therefore they were enjoying working on our wedding. The happiness was abundant! I will be honest and say we knew we were a difficult couple to work with as we were very indecisive, but she never made us feel that way. If you want to save yourself some stress, look no further, this team will guide you right.

We can’t recommend the Savoir team enough. We originally tried to plan our wedding on our own and quickly realized that you don’t know what you don’t know until it comes up. Once w...

e hired Savoir, everything became so much easier and we were kicking ourselves wishing we had worked with a planner from the start. They helped us create a clear plan to plan, always had answers when questions popped up, and made the entire process feel manageable. On the wedding day, a few inevitable hiccups happened (our florist accidentally left with the toss bouquet, our catering team was a bit behind), and the Savoir team handled it all so smoothly that we barely noticed. Because of them, we were able to relax and actually enjoy our day. We’re incredibly grateful and couldn’t recommend Savoir more.

ease. Throughout the entire planning process, she was attentive, responsive, and consistently made sure we were on track without ever making us feel overwhelmed. Paige was an absolute pro when it came to organizing and coordinating with our venue and vendors. She handled everything seamlessly behind the scenes. Her attention to detail was incredible, and she was spot-on with the timeline, ensuring everything flowed smoothly from start to finish on our wedding day. Beyond her professionalism, what really stood out to us was how approachable, kind, and caring she is. She truly went above and beyond, and we’re not just saying that. Our wedding day literally would not have gone as beautifully and smoothly without her. Even our guests couldn’t stop raving about how organized, relaxed, and stunning the entire day was and we know that’s largely thanks to Paige’s incredible work. We are so grateful to have had her by our side.

As someone who works full time, it was so helpful to be able to set up calls/video chats after hours, and I really appreciated the flexibility.

tion, Paige had this calm confidence that immediately put me at ease. She embodies "calm, cool, and collected" in every sense—and that energy carried us through the entire process. From the constant emails and texts, to her impeccable eye for detail and deep understanding of how an event should flow, she absolutely nailed it. We had 260 guests (no small task!) and heard so many people say it was the most seamless wedding they'd ever attended. The Savoir team handled the logistics, the chaos, and yes—even a few wild guests—with total grace and professionalism. I'm going to miss working with Paige, but I cannot recommend her enough to any bride planning a wedding in the Wine Country, North Bay, or Tahoe area. She's the best of the best

We loved working with Savoir. I want to get married again just to do it all over! I'm a healthcare professional and did not want to spend so much of my time on planning. Working wi...

th Savoir felt like I was hanging with a couple of super girlfriends. I'm also not very creative by trade. Even so, my favorite part of planning turned out to be when they brought us to showrooms to design. They took my ideas and in their words went full Martha Stewart. My husband -can't believe I get to say that now- says his favorite was the very clear budget tracker and the menu tasting. I have to agree with him, their budget tracker was monumental to help us understand our investments. The wedding day itself was smooth and my guests raved at the food the decor the DJ the venue everything! We are so fortunate to have found these ladies. We now have all these happy memories thanks to them!

We were referred to Paige from our wedding venue, The Estate Yountville. They had worked with her before. Since it was a destination wedding we were especially nervous with all t...

he things that go into a wedding for 100 guests. Paige was truly amazing. Here’s why. First, her process is all about having the couple articulate a vision. And then she makes it happen. From colors, to rental furniture, to the flower vibe she was able to make the event truly reflect us. As we live on the other side of the country, we had no clue which vendors to hire. There’s a lot of pieces from flowers, to rentals, to music to photography - she was able to select vendors and give us a short list of candidates. Second, throughout the process she managed everything including the budget. She knows how to make things fit and when to call out niceties that break the budget. Third, she uses an online system which was very good at helping us coordinate everything with her. This includes seating charts, meal selection, and other vital details. The system - but really her management through the system - made all the difference. Lastly, she was there throughout the big day making sure every minute was perfect. On top of all this for the actual wedding, she also arranged the rehearsal/welcome dinner for 100 people at Charles Krug Winery. That was very memorable too.

This is a long overdue review! It’s been exactly one year since our wedding day, and we look back on it so fondly, thanks to Savoir. I was extremely happy to work with this wonderf...

ul team then, and my feelings have not changed one bit to this day. When you feel like you owe so much to someone, it’s much harder to give just a simple review. In retrospect, and without exaggeration, contacting Savoir was one of the best decisions I have made in my adult life. The photos from the day spark more joy than I could have imagined, and each captured moment brings me back to the best day ever. From recommendations of the best vendors to stylistic choices like the linens and stationery, Savoir knew exactly what elevated our preferences. My husband and I still randomly think about how cool our chairs looked and how the appetizers were to die for. We would never have discovered such amazing rentals or food choices without Savoir. The quality of their work is a testament to their impeccable sense of style and vast experience with many couples. I hope they realize they have a lasting impact on a couple’s lives after the big day. No review can do their work justice, and I can’t thank the team enough. I wish Savoir the best, and I know there will be more happy marriages thanks to them!

Leading up the day, I knew she had everything buttoned up and ready to go. She took all vendor communication and planning off my plate the month leading up to the wedding which allowed me to focus on the fun things!! She was supportive and just such a pleasure to work with. She was communicative and prompt with her responses and ALL of my questions. She totally got my vision and was my right hand man for everything. I truly know that my wedding was exactly what I was hoping for all because of Paige.

Like most brides, I was so concerned about the details and wasn’t sure how I was going to pull it off… but Savoir handled it! I heard about Savoir through a friend and WOW, these ladies really made my day PERFECT! It’s been a year and I’m still raving about how wonderful my wedding was.

She handled every hiccup with such ease, that I, the bride, had no clue anything was going wrong. She could brainstorm at the drop of a hat to problem-solve any dilemma. My wedding day was one of my favorite days simply because she allowed me to be a bride. She took over all managing, encouraged me to relax, and she handled it all. If I could do it over again, I would, just to have Paige lead the way. You will never be disappointed by her. Her Type A personality, along with her peaceful spirit made our day completely magical.
