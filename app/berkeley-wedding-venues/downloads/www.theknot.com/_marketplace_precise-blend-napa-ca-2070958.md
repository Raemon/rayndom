d James and that’s when we started to relax. James was really easy to work with and understood the assignment. My favorite memory was hearing about Uncle BingBong and Uncle Bingon. James went around the room looking for Uncle BingBong and found my Uncle BingOn- He wasn’t sure if this was a real uncle or not but Uncle BingBong was in fact real! James was so fun about it and I couldn’t tell otherwise. I am so glad I found James and I suggest you book him ASAP. Thank you James for your positivity and your dedication to your work.

We never had to think about microphones or speakers or lights, everything just worked, and he read the crowd and mixed perfectly for the dance floor. And the photo booth was a big hit!

What really blew us away was how smoothly they mixed our Indian music requests with all the Western hits we wanted. They created this perfect blend that had all our guests - from both sides of the family - dancing together. They were such great partners throughout the whole process and made our reception everything we dreamed of. If you want a DJ who actually understands music and knows how to throw a party, definitely go with Precise Blend!

the front of their both. It made our wedding set up look extra put together. They have an easy to use app so you can choose the music you want. You can even add more friends and family on the app so they can add music too. They go above and beyond too. James was able to remove the vocals on a song so that the live singer could use it to sing our first dance song. The most important part, they had the best music going continuously at the right times. The dance floor was full at my wedding the entire time even though the AC stopped working in the hall and it was really hot in there. After my reception, everyone wanted to keep dancing, they didn’t want to stop! The DJ James, made the reception so much fun. My friends and family still talk about how much fun they had at our wedding! I would hire them again in a heartbeat, and will use them for my events in the future!

ked to him that he was perfect for us and our wedding. We booked him last minute (probably 2 months in advance) and he was so accommodating. If we needed anything, he was a quick text away. He has a wonderful app to pick all your music and organize it from the processional, to the cocktail hour music, etc. I sent him a few songs that I wanted to surprise my now husband with to walk down the aisle and he put them together for me and made it perfect for me. Another great aspect was that our photographers Photo Booth broke from another wedding so we reached out to James and he made sure that we had a Photo Booth. It was amazing and the pictures from our family and friends are so fun! James has a wonderful team and made our night amazing and fun! We consider him family now. I would recommend him to anyone! Thank you forever James. We cant thank you enough! You are truly one of a kind and made our wedding amazing and so much fun! Sincerely, The Farleys

James was a pleasure to work with and very professional. He did both my son (in 2015) and my daughters wedding (in 2023). He had the dance floor full both times. Don’t hesitate to ...

book with him. Would highly recommend.

DJ ToFu is definitely the best of the best when it comes to keeping the party going all night. My hubby and I had the pleasure of experiencing DJ ToFu's skills when he DJ'd our wed...

ding in October 2014. To this day, friends and family come up to us and tell us how much fun they had dancing at our wedding. It's all thanks to our awesome DJ! From the moment DJ ToFu took over the decks, the energy in the room was electric. Every music selection he played was spot-on as he mixed old-school classics and modern tracks that kept everyone on the dance floor. Seriously, everyone danced all night. With such seamless transitions between songs, there was never a dull moment and there was never any awkwardness that comes from a DJ mixing the wrong song. One thing I really appreciated about DJ ToFu was his impeccable ability to read the crowd. He knew what songs to play to get the people pumped. He enjoyed seeing everyone's energy get so hyped during one particular song, that he played it again just so he could experience our joy again too. Everyone loved it, it was an awesome moment. It was nice to see him having just as much fun as we were on our special day. I say all this to say, don't leave your music up to anybody who calls themselves a DJ. Choose DJ ToFu because his skills and energy are unmatched.

On a stressful day, its nice to know that you wont have to worry about your DJ. James is exactly that, he contributed so much joy to our special day. From the start of the hiring ...

process James was so kind and easy to work with. He is very clear, professional, and considerate to our preferences. He took into consideration our requests, and even helped us on the Father Daughter dance mix, which came out perfect! From the start of the night, the dance floor was never empty. He has a talent of being able to read the crowd and elevate the mood of the room. Everyone couldn't help but dance. Hire him if you want peace of mind and things to run smoothly when it comes to your DJ party needs.
