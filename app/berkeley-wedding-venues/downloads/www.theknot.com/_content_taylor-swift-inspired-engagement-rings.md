## Taylor Swift's Engagement Ring

It was the proposal that was seen around the world. Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce announced their engagement on August 26, 2025, and the highly-anticipated Instagram hard launch has since racked up over 30 million likes (and counting). Unsurprisingly, [Taylor Swift's engagement ring](https://www.theknot.com/content/taylor-swift-engagement-ring) is a sight to behold. Kelce proposed with an elongated Old Mine diamond set on a chunky band. While authentic Old Mines are quite rare, similar styles like cushions, emeralds and Asshcers give off a similar vibe. Browse our favorite selections here to get started—or, find a local jeweler from [The Knot Vendor Marketplace](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace) to guide your search for the perfect antique stone. 

### Marrow Fine Georgia Solitaire Engagement Ring 

![bezel-set cushion engagement ring](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/2c85f42d-6f6a-4877-83b5-7a84908770f9~rs_768.h)

With a metal-forward band, this bezel-set engagement ring is one of our favorite dupes for Taylor Swift's. Inspired by the Georgian era, it's both effortlessly cool and timeless, exuding the perfect amount of vintage flair. 

[$4,550 | Marrow Fine](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=59345&awinaffid=565019&campaign=&clickref=TK-taylor-swift-inspired-engagement-rings&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.marrowfine.com%2Fproducts%2Fthe-georgia-solitaire-engagement-ring-yellow-gold&platform=pl)

### Kwiat Engagement Ring with Ashoka Diamond 

![Ashoka diamond on a gold band](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/80a0d4f8-a408-4677-b0d7-4ba61c1a7d9b~rs_768.h)

_Photo: Kwiat_

While an Ashoka diamond isn't the exact same as an Old Mine, it looks similar thanks to its elongated body with curved edges and chunky facet pattern. This dazzling center stone is a near perfect-replica of Taylor Swift's and is ideal for the wearer who wants a bejeweled engagement era. 

[Inquire For Price](https://kwiat.com/diamond-jewelry/engagement-ring-with-an-ashoka-diamond-in-18k-yellow-gold-style-f-17262ak-0-dia-18ky/?template=new&selected=metal)

### Brilliant Earth Peyton Solitaire Ring 

![Cushion-shaped engagement ring on thick gold band](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/567ecb93-280a-437b-806d-36e825f0c9df~rs_768.h)

_Photo: Brilliant Earth_

If the elongated shape isn't quite your style, you can still evoke Taylor Swift's engagement ring vibe with a rounder cushion-shaped center stone. This one from Brilliant Earth is perched on a trendy thick band designed to sit flush with the wedding ring of your choice. 

[From $1,350 | Brilliant Earth](https://brilliantearth.sjv.io/c/64733/1041908/13541?subId1=TK-taylor-swift-inspired-engagement-rings&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brilliantearth.com%2FPeyton-4mm-Solitaire-Ring-Gold-BE12148-23884915%2F%3Firclickid%3DzKS1cXT98xyPUzC3gAUIj3OGUkpzlPU7ER%3AQTM0%26utm_medium%3Dimpact%26utm_source%3DThe%2BKnot%2BWorldwide%2BInc.%26utm_campaign%3DThe%2BKnot%2BWorldwide%2BInc._64733_Online%2BTracking%2BLink%26mp_value1%3DONLINE_TRACKING_LINK%26irgwc%3D1%26utm_content%3DOnline%2BTracking%2BLink)

## Taylor Swift

Released in 2006, Taylor Swift's first self-titled album is lovingly referred to as her "Debut" era among fans. Sweet, sassy and with a bit of country flair, this Taylor Swift era translates to classic engagement rings in our eyes. Here are our favorite picks that correlate to the album that started it all. 

### Blue Nile Classic Four-Prong Solitaire Engagement Ring

![Blue Nile four prong solitaire diamond engagement ring inspired by Taylor Swift](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/6ba9e104-e43e-4b4a-a21e-f03b10ebf67b~rs_768.h-cr_265.338.1316.1389)

_Photo: Blue Nile_

The _Taylor Swift_ album gave us classic hits like "Our Song" and "Teardrops on My Guitar." While her discography has grown and matured in the years since this release, there's no denying that the OG era is *peak* Taylor Swift. That's why we recommend getting a timeless engagement ring if this is your favorite era. You simply can't go wrong with a four-prong solitaire engagement ring, especially with a round center stone. There's a reason this time-honored look has been the [most popular engagement ring style](https://www.theknot.com/content/the-knot-engagement-ring-stats) for decades. 

[From $550 | Blue Nile](https://www.bluenile.com/engagement-rings/design-your-own-ring/classic-four-prong-solitaire-engagement-ring-in-14k-white-gold-item-194360?a_aid=5c3367062612e&a_cid=55e51e63&chan=TKEditorial&data1=TK-taylor-swift-inspired-engagement-rings)

### Brilliant Earth Secret Halo Diamond Engagement Ring

![Brilliant Earth secret halo pear shaped diamond engagement ring inspired by Taylor Swift](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/4b42a242-66da-4823-860d-541978d7b97f~rs_768.h-cr_47.7.809.769)

_Photo: Brilliant Earth_

The pun writes itself for this Taylor Swift-inspired engagement ring. If your S.O. once had an emotional attachment to "Teardrops on My Guitar," they'll be obsessed with this pear (or teardrop) shaped engagement ring. Not only is this a finger-flattering shape, pears tend to appear larger than their [carat weight](https://www.theknot.com/content/engagement-ring-diamond-grading), giving you more bang for your buck. We love the addition of a hidden halo around the basket, which adds the subtlest pop of extra sparkle. 

[From $1,050 | Brilliant Earth](https://brilliantearth.sjv.io/c/64733/1041908/13541?subId1=-taylor-swift-inspired-engagement-rings&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brilliantearth.com%2FSecret-Halo-Diamond-Ring-Gold-BE1D13065-6495631%2F)

### Ring Concierge Old Mine Engagement Ring with Hidden Halo

![Old Mine Taylor Swift Inspired Engagement Ring with Hidden Halo from Ring Concierge](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/18d3cb89-9557-4135-be8d-f444230d2491~rs_768.h-cr_141.248.1065.1172)

_Photo: Ring Concierge_

Considering this album is the first one in Swift's discography, we can't help but pair the debut era with a vintage diamond cut, like this Old Mine engagement ring. It may seem like a typical diamond at first glance, but a deeper look reveals facets that are larger and asymmetrical. That's because modern diamonds are cut by machines, while Old Mine diamonds are inspired by gems that were once cut by hand. Ideal for someone who wants a timeless design that isn't too modern, an Old Mine engagement ring has a classic look from far away—but up close, it gives off a unique effect you won't see on many other hands. 

[$28,200 | Ring Concierge](https://ring-concierge.pxf.io/c/64733/863937/12049?subId1=-taylor-swift-inspired-engagement-rings&u=https%3A%2F%2Fringconcierge.com%2Fproducts%2F2-08-old-mine-natural-diamond-ring%3Fvariant%3D40228748755032)

## Fearless

If _Fearless_ was the album you blasted while getting ready for your high school football games, we see you. Known for its recognizable golden yellow hue, this Taylor Swift era is about as nostalgic as it gets. 

### Jean Dousset Chelsea Bezel Solitaire Lab Diamond Engagement Ring

![Jean Dousset yellow gold solitaire lab diamond Taylor Swift inspired engagement ring](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/d172d726-ce69-401f-bba9-930059a9bc27~rs_768.h-cr_604.554.2395.2345)

_Photo: Jean Dousset_

It goes without saying that a _Fearless_ -inspired engagement ring should have a gold setting. We love this sleek bezel from Jean Dousset (who, by the way, is the great-great-grandson of Louis Cartier). Although bezel settings are known as a vintage style (kind of like this older era, cough cough), they've had a comeback in recent years…just like _Fearless_ after its re-recording was released. Not only does the all-encompassing setting give your diamond extra security, this particular style has a high-polish border, making the design look extra chic and fashion-forward. 

[From $1,500 | Jean Dousset](https://www.pjatr.com/t/8-12864-88550-287526?sid=-taylor-swift-inspired-engagement-rings&website=177979&url=https%3A%2F%2Fjeandousset.com%2Fcollections%2Fchelsea-engagement-rings%2Fproducts%2Fchelsea-bezel-solitaire-lab-diamond-engagement-ring%3Fvariant%3D44754830295295%26)

### Shane Co. Timeless Solitaire Engagement Ring

![Solitaire asscher cut diamond engagement ring inspired by Taylor Swift from Shane Co.](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/5c2ba59d-83ee-4c73-972e-311969a4a3b9~rs_768.h-cr_65.1.975.911)

_Photo: Shane Co._

Taylor Swift looked like a princess in the _Love Story_ music video, where her beloved knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring in front of a towering castle. We like to think of the square Asscher [diamond shape](https://www.theknot.com/content/brilliant-tips-how-to-choose-a-diamond-shape) as a modern iteration of the princess cut, making this a regal selection for _Fearless_ aficionados. 

[From $515 | Shane Co.](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=9ibcrDa*U1o&mid=53014&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.shaneco.com%2Fengagement-rings%2Fsolitaire-engagement-rings%2Ftimeless-solitaire-engagement-ring%2Fp%2F41004888&u1=tk-taylor-swift-inspired-engagement-rings)

### Marrow Fine Imperial Topaz Abstract Bezel Ring

![Topaz abstract bezel Taylor Swift inspired engagement ring from Marrow](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/2583e458-a822-4637-993f-895d21d76e75~rs_768.h-cr_263.236.1219.1192)

_Photo: Marrow Fine_

If you love the warm hue of the _Fearless_ album cover, a topaz engagement ring may be the engagement ring for you. We're fond of this ring's abstract bezel setting, which gives off the same energy as the iconic hair flip associated with this era. 

[$3,200 | Marrow Fine](https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&u=1030781&m=115444&afftrack=-taylor-swift-inspired-engagement-rings&urllink=www.marrowfine.com%2Fcollections%2Fcolored-gemstones%2Fproducts%2F1-52ct-imperial-topaz-abstract-bezel-ring)

## Speak Now 

_Speak Now_ fans are lovers at heart. After all, this romantic, whimsical era featured quite a few nods to weddings. Plus, the imagery associated with the lyrics is downright magical. Here are a few ~enchanting~ engagement rings for the _Speak Now_ stans out there. 

### James Allen Classic Round Shape Three Stone Engagement Ring

![James Allen round shape three stone diamond Taylor Swift inspired diamond engagement ring](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/e7d560e3-2b34-49e2-bb32-e83a47e788ec~rs_768.h-cr_62.92.753.783)

_Photo: James Allen_

While the definition of a "perfect" engagement ring will vary among everyone's personal tastes, there's no denying that more diamonds wouldn't hurt. Three-stone engagement rings are one of the [top trends](https://www.theknot.com/content/engagement-ring-trends) right now, as people can't help but gravitate to flashy designs that offer serious finger coverage. We love this dazzling trio from James Allen, which has dainty round diamonds flanking a matching center stone. If you pop the question with this _Speak Now_ -inspired engagement ring, we have a feeling your fiancé will say yes…followed by, "This _ring_ is the best thing that's ever been mine." 

[From $2,200 | James Allen](https://www.jamesallen.com/engagement-rings/three-stone/14k-white-gold-classic-round-shape-three-stone-engagement-ring-item-63036?a_aid=5c3367062612e&a_cid=dfef9309&chan=TKEditorial&data1=TK-taylor-swift-inspired-engagement-rings)

### Marrow Fine Purple Sapphire Twist Ring

![Purple sapphire twist Taylor Swift inspired engagement ring from Marrow](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/d99f5f38-f078-4ebc-9bb6-b15287821246~rs_768.h-cr_265.267.1241.1243)

_Photo: Marrow Fine_

Take one look at this twisted engagement ring band and try to tell us it *doesn't* look like Taylor Swift's skirt on the _Speak Now_ cover. We've got all the heart eyes for this whimsical design from Marrow Fine, which highlights a lovely lavender sapphire at the center. The satin-like effect of the setting makes this an easy choice for any _Speak Now_ devotée. 

[$4,450 | Marrow Fine](https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&u=1030781&m=115444&afftrack=-taylor-swift-inspired-engagement-rings&urllink=www.marrowfine.com%2Fcollections%2Fcolored-gemstones%2Fproducts%2F1-45ct-purple-sapphire-twist-ring)

### Vera Wang Diamond & Blue Sapphire Engagement Ring

![Vera Wang diamond and blue sapphire Taylor Swift inspired diamond engagement ring from Jared](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/7648a44e-2f19-4d68-8459-0f1f9502d7ae~rs_768.h-cr_37.63.769.795)

_Photo: Jared_

Do you also go back to December all the time? While the birthstone for the last month of the year is turquoise, it's not the best material for an engagement ring. That said, blue sapphire is a close dupe, and it serves as a beautiful nod to one of the songs that helped define the _Speak Now_ era. We love this sparkly design from wedding industry maven Vera Wang, which features a deep cerulean center stone within a halo of diamonds with smaller sapphire and diamond stones lining the band. 

[$6,000 | Jared](https://www.jared.com/vera-wang-wish-diamond-blue-sapphire-engagement-ring-1-ct-tw-ovalround-emeraldbaguette-14k-white-gold/p/V-994692109)

## Red

I don't know about you, but finding a _Red_ era engagement ring is quite simple. Rather than opt for a traditional white diamond, consider a gemstone, like a ruby or a red sapphire. Here are some of our favorites. 

### GemsNY Rectangle Cushion Ruby Hidden Halo Ring

![Ruby rectangle cushion Taylor Swift engagement ring from GemsNY](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/d62a12f3-18e0-44dc-97cb-5eb527e096b3~rs_768.h-cr_12.3.984.975)

_Photo: GemsNY_

We love this burning red cushion-cut ruby, which is set in a delicate prong halo. In fact, some would say this fiery ring is like the colors in autumn, so bright, just before they lose it all. Ideal for the non-traditional jewelry lover in your life, this gemstone engagement ring features a hidden halo for a subtle pop of sparkle. 

[From $1,920 | GemsNY](https://www.gemsny.com/preset-ruby-rings/Petite-Prong-Set-Rectangle-Cushion-Ruby-Hidden-Halo-Ring-RRB039-7X5-A/)

### Grown Brilliance Oval and Pear Lab Grown Diamond Engagement Ring

![Oval cut ruby and pear cut diamond Taylor Swift inspired engagement ring from Grown Brilliance](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/e09f0c17-c236-4511-a224-48848fb73286~rs_768.h-cr_191.1.1777.1587)

_Photo: Grown Briliance_

If a ruby engagement ring is a little on the nose, the _Red_ lover in your life might prefer this two-stone engagement ring, which features a ruby *and* a diamond. In this lab-created engagement ring design, two gorgeous gems lay next to each other on a gold band, creating a look that's fun and flirty—just like this era. 

[$3,275 | Grown Brilliance](https://grownbrilliance.sjv.io/c/64733/1750582/20460?subId1=-taylor-swift-inspired-engagement-rings&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.grownbrilliance.com%2F9x7mm-oval-cut-created-ruby-and-1-1-2-ctw-pear-cut-lab-grown-diamond-two-stone-engagement-ring-14k-yellow-gold%2Fpid%2FRIGTXR06626-RU-GY4)

### Noémie Selene Moonlight Round Diamond Engagement Ring

![Moonlight round diamond Taylor Swift inspired engagement ring from Noémie](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/49a2e9d7-6766-48e0-a09d-44ce42f1fe95~rs_768.h-cr_160.140.954.934)

_Photo: Noémie_

One of our favorite _Red_ fun facts is that the song "Starlight" was inspired by the love story of Bobby and Ethel Kennedy. Based on the name alone, we can't help but link this song with Noémie's moonlight diamond engagement ring. Despite the round center stone, it sits in a crescent-shaped setting, giving off a pointed, star-like appearance. (The similar names are just a bonus!) 

[From $1,430 | Noémie](https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&u=1030781&m=66958&afftrack=-taylor-swift-inspired-engagement-rings&urllink=www.hellonoemie.com%2Fproducts%2Fselene-round-diamond-engagement-ring%3Fvariant%3D42719546933282)

## 1989

When you think of the _1989_ era, you probably envision disco balls, neon lights and New York City. Fun, flirty and sparkly, this Taylor Swift era can be interpreted in so many fun engagement ring styles, which we highlight below. 

### Dana Rebecca Designs Oval Pavé Solitaire Engagement Ring

More and more people are falling in love with this elongated finger-flattering shape, meaning you simply can't go wrong with a design like this one. Even better, the glittering pavé setting reminds us of the dazzling NYC skyline at night.

### Blue Nile Oval Aquamarine and Diamond Sidestone Ring

_Photo: Blue Nile_

Based on aesthetics alone, this engagement ring is the perfect representation of the _1989_ era. A striking aquamarine gem sits between two diamond side stones, creating a beautiful rendition of the new album art for the re-release. Once the ring is in your possession, plan a[ proposal on the beach](https://www.theknot.com/content/beach-proposal-ideas) for the full _1989_ effect.

### VRAI Floating Split Band Round Brilliant Engagement Ring

![Floating split band round Taylor Swift inspired engagement ring from VRAI](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/7fdf66c2-251f-4d10-a6c9-724bfb15bc01~rs_768.h-cr_150.154.1048.1052)

_Photo: VRAI_

Blank space on your engagement ring? The concept isn't as crazy as it sounds. The Swiftie who loves this _1989_ hit will be delighted by the clever metaphor presented in this engagement ring. Known for its nontraditional look, a split shank band has—you guessed it—black space next to the center stone, making it appear as though it's floating above the finger. 

[From $1,100 | VRAI](https://vraiandoro.qyov.net/c/64733/615401/10025?subId1=-taylor-swift-inspired-engagement-rings&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vrai.com%2Fengagement-ring%2Ffloating-split-band-ring%2Fround-brilliant-yellow-gold-40431523332189)

## Reputation

When you think of a _Reputation_ -inspired engagement ring, you might link this era with an inky black onyx stone or a rich green emerald—but these styles are far from your only option. Keep scrolling to discover our favorite "cool girl" engagement rings that are perfect for the _Reputation_ fan in your life. 

### Marrow Fine Black Diamond Pear and Old Mine Cut Toi et Moi Ring

![Black diamond pear and old mine cut toi et moi Taylor Swift inspired reputation engagement ring](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/440c79e2-9810-4bc0-9076-4a7d4a6185b8~rs_768.h-cr_470.831.2457.2818)

_Photo: Marrow Fine_

If your partner is daring enough for a black engagement ring, they'll fall in love with this edgy toi et moi design. French for "you and me," the name alone is perfectly aligned with the swoon-worthy love songs on this album (like "King of My Heart" and "Call It What You Want.") An onyx pear diamond sits next to a bezel-set Old Mine diamond, which creates an engagement ring that's fresh, modern and impossibly cool.

### GemsNY Marquise Emerald Bypass Ring

Slithering snakes and _Reputation_ go hand-in-hand. If you love the snarky symbolism associated with this era, you might fall in love with this serpentine-esque engagement ring from GemsNY. A bright green marquise stone sits within an open bypass prong setting, and you simply can't deny its resemblance to Karyn the cobra. (IYKYK.) 

[From $1,148 | GemsNY](https://www.gemsny.com/preset-emerald-rings/Marquise-Emerald-Bypass-Ring-With-Prong-Set-Round-Diamonds-REM094-7X3.5-AA/?Metal_Type=34)

### Charles & Colvard Marquise Classic Solitaire Engagement Ring

![Marquise classic solitaire diamond engagement ring inspired by Taylor Swift](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/f9bb1172-12c4-4839-8028-f607816ed580~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1200.1200)

_Photo: Charles & Colvard_

Remember that iconic bathtub scene in the "Look What You Made Me Do" music video? (You know, the one where Taylor casually sits in a pool of diamonds.) While you might not be able to recreate that exact situation for your engagement, you can propose with a ring inspired by one of the baubles she's wearing. This lab-grown marquise-cut engagement ring is a near-perfect dupe for the sparkler that sits on her pointer finger—but let's be honest, it would look absolutely _gorgeous_ on your partner's ring finger.

## Lover

The _Lover_ era conjures up images of pink, gold and lilac. This romantic album delivered instant wedding classics, from "Lover" (which is now one of the [most popular first dance songs](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-songs-the-knot-spotify-playlist)) to swoon-worthy deep cuts like "Daylight" and "Paper Rings." It's only fair, then, for this era to be represented by engagement ring designs that are just as romantic. 

### Erika Winters Laurel Oval Solitaire Diamond Engagement Ring

![Oval solitaire diamond engagement ring inspired by Taylor Swift from Greenwich St Jewelers](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/d06d74b6-baaf-41ca-b29d-713426bfe163~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.800.800)

_Photo: Greenwich St Jewelers_

Nothing screams "Lover" quite like a rose gold engagement ring. We love the subtle symbolism of this ring from Greenwich St. Jewelers, which is located in Tribeca—AKA one of Taylor Swift's favorite NYC neighborhoods. While oval-cut engagement rings are soaring in popularity, the unique knife-edge setting of this rosy band sets it apart from other designs.

_Lover_ gave us some of Taylor Swift's most romantic lyrics, well, ever. One of our favorite ways to pay homage to the title track of this album is to [engrave your engagement ring](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-rings-engraving-ideas-tips) with a meaningful lyric. Thanks to this KAY Jewelers engagement ring, you can easily customize every element of the design, from the diamond to gemstone shape to the mounting and even the color of the side stones. Then, before you finish, add your own personal engraving. Consider using something like "All's well that ends well" or "Darling, you're my lover."

### Kwiat Engagement Ring with Radiant Yellow Diamond and Side Stones

A wise woman once said she thought love would be burning red, but it's golden. If that adage speaks to your love story, allow us to introduce you to this Kwiat yellow diamond engagement ring. Thanks to its brilliant radiant cut, this dazzling center stone shines like the sun at peak daylight. We can't think of a better _Lover_ -inspired engagement ring.

## Folklore 

Taylor Swift shocked the world with the release of _Folklore_ in 2020. Not only was the album completely unexpected, the folksy soundtrack was a stark departure from her typical pop sound. She would later explain to fans that many of the album's storylines were fictionalized tales from bygone eras she dreamed up while isolating during the pandemic. As such, we interpret _Folklore_ -inspired engagement rings to feature vintage-inspired details. 

### The North Way Studio Aurélie Ring in Natural Sapphire and Diamond 

![Vintage folklore-inspired engagement ring with sapphire in a milgrain bezel setting](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/4b9c083f-ecb0-4e1f-8fd0-74afcf2c968e~rs_768.h-cr_240.0.2160.1440)

_Photo: The North Way Studio_

What treasures would you find in Betty or Augustine's jewelry box? You might discover something like this gilded engagement ring from The North Way Studio, which was made in collaboration with wedding dress designer [Claire Pettibone](https://clairepettibone.com/). An opalescent sapphire sits within a milgrain bezel setting on a knife-edge band, which has unfurling leaf-like details and a rustic satin finish. Doesn't this just scream "august"? While we love this particular ring, the entire [Secret Garden collection](https://thenorthwaystudio.com/collections/the-north-way-studio-claire-pettibone) exudes _F_ _olklore_ energy. 

[$6,500 | The North Way Studio](https://thenorthwaystudio.com/products/the-aurelie-ring-in-natural-sapphire-and-diamond)

### Shane Co. Woodland Wedding Set

![Yellow gold leaves Taylor Swift inspired diamond engagement ring from Shane Co.](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/0f229f70-f3df-486c-a20b-7a6e1d52b77d~rs_768.h-cr_493.400.1491.1398)

_Photo: Shane Co._

Most Swifties associate this Grammy-winning album with the cottagecore aesthetic, so we can't think of anything more appropriate than Shane Co.'s woodland wedding set. The center stone of your choice sits within a woven, botanical setting, which is ideal for the wearer who wants to listen to "seven" while frolicking in a field of wildflowers. 

[From $1,825 | Shane Co.](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=9ibcrDa*U1o&mid=53014&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.shaneco.com%2Fengagement-rings%2Fwedding-sets%2Fwoodland-wedding-set%2Fp%2F41097399&u1=tk-taylor-swift-inspired-engagement-rings)

### With Clarity Elegance Emerald Cut Side Stone Engagement Ring

![Emerald cut diamond engagement ring with yellow gold band inspired by Taylor Swift from With Clarity](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/85750a27-3500-43f4-a06e-c1ec6c83a21b~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.900.900)

_Photo: With Clarity_

Let's turn to "The Last Great American Dynasty" for some ringspo, shall we? This biographical song tells the tale of Rebekah Harkness, an American socialite who owned Taylor Swift's famed Rhode Island mansion in the 1950s. She was married to Bill Harkness, a successful attorney and heir to the Standard Oil fortune. As such, the Harkness name is synonymous with old money—and nothing says old money quite like an emerald-cut engagement ring. Known for its unique "hall of mirrors" step-cut effect, this timeless diamond shape exudes elegance and class. We love this particular style, which features an emerald-cut center stone flanked by two smaller emeralds on each side, including a hidden halo for extra sparkle. 

[From $1,650 | With Clarity](https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&u=1030781&m=68204&afftrack=-taylor-swift-inspired-engagement-rings&urllink=www.withclarity.com%2Fproducts%2Felegance-emerald-cut-side-stone-engagement-ring%3Fvariant%3D45809159962907)

## Evermore 

_Folklore's_ sister album, _Evermore_ , has a corresponding woodsy aesthetic. Released just a few months after its predecessor, this tracklist has a similar sound—which means we associate it with similar engagement ring styles too. Shop our top picks below. 

### Brilliant Earth Arden Diamond Engagement Ring with Emerald Accents

![Pear shaped diamond engagement ring with lab emerald accents inspired by Taylor Swift](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/a019b2e8-df0a-4942-b138-6301771050d0~rs_768.h-cr_44.29.811.796)

_Photo: Brilliant Earth_

If you always have songs like "ivy" and "willow" on repeat, a nature-inspired trellis ring like this one from Brilliant Earth is right up your alley. What we love most is that you can customize the accent stones on this _Evermore_ -inspired engagement ring. Select diamonds for more of a classic look, or go all in with emerald gems for a true efflorescent engagement ring. 

[From $1,350 | Brilliant Earth](https://brilliantearth.sjv.io/c/64733/1041908/13541?subId1=-taylor-swift-inspired-engagement-rings&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brilliantearth.com%2FArden-Diamond-Ring-with-Lab-Emerald-Accents-Gold-BE1D8164G-15625915%2F)

### Blanca Monrós Gómez Champagne Diamond Solitaire Ring

![Champagne solitaire diamond engagement ring inspired by Taylor Swift from Catbird](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/8ff356a8-9ab1-41ab-a205-22c9861660ad~rs_768.h-cr_110.108.1402.1400)

_Photo: Catbird_

Champagne problems? More like champagne _diamonds_. Fans love belting this _Evermore_ song on the [Eras Tour](https://www.theknot.com/content/taylor-swift-eras-outfits-bachelorette)—and although it includes symbolism about a broken engagement, we couldn't help but get inspired by its bubby imagery. After all, who could say no to a champagne-colored diamond? This off-white center stone is cradled between two smaller champagne diamonds, all held together with a pavé diamond band.

[$5,285 | Catbird](https://www.catbirdnyc.com/champagne-diamond-solitaire-ring.html)

### Mejuri Diamond Eternity Band

![Yellow gold diamond eternity band inspired by Taylor Swift from Mejuri](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/370f9c4c-5363-461e-854f-c2b050da1991~rs_768.h-cr_217.371.1001.1155)

_Photo: Mejuri_

The tone of _Evermore_ is much more mellow and subdued compared to Taylor Swift's other pop-heavy discography. If that sounds like your partner's sense of style, they might prefer an engagement band rather than an engagement ring. We love this simple diamond eternity stacker from Mejuri, which is made with recycled 14k solid gold. 

[From $1,200 | Mejuri](https://mejuri.pxf.io/c/64733/890344/12305?subId1=-taylor-swift-inspired-engagement-rings&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmejuri.com%2Fproducts%2Fdiamond-eternity-band%3FMaterial%3D14k%2BYellow%2BGold%26Stone%3DNatural%2BDiamond)

## Midnights 

The synth-pop sounds of Taylor Swift's tenth studio album are best represented by rich, decadent gemstones. (This is the album that gave us "Bejeweled," after all.) With so much inspiration to work with, here are just a few _Midnights_ -inspired engagement rings. 

### Wwake Sapphire Mason Ring

![Emerald cut sapphire Taylor Swift inspired engagement ring from Catbird](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/3a366ef8-0747-403b-b754-207c8a28b134~rs_768.h-cr_121.228.1393.1500)

_Photo: Catbird_

Once upon a time, the planets and the fates and all the stars aligned—and they brought you *this* celestial engagement ring. We're starry-eyed over the emerald-cut blue sapphire center stone, which looks like the sky at dusk. It's surrounded by an ethereal cluster of round- and baguette-cut side stones arranged to look like constellations. Take our word and don't waste one more second before buying this engagement ring for your _Midnights_ -loving S.O. They'll think you're a mastermind for finding the perfect ring. 

[$3,295 | Catbird](https://www.catbirdnyc.com/mason-emerald-cut-sapphire-ring.html)

### Melanie Casey Clear Water Ring

![Clear water cluster Taylor Swift inspired engagement ring with aquamarine, sapphire, and tanzanite, accented by white diamond, aqua blue diamond, aquamarine, and sapphire side stones from Melanie Casey](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/54e4b553-a356-4eaa-add7-6d4f8f1b870d~rs_768.h-cr_716.403.2486.2173)

_Photo: Melanie Casey_

Best believe _you'll_ be bejeweled with this Taylor Swift-inspired engagement ring. Reminiscent of the song's flashy, colorful music video, this cluster of aquamarine, sapphire, tanzanite and diamond stones is a sight to behold. When this ring sits on your love's hand, there's no doubt they'll always make the whole place shimmer. 

[$2,200 | Melanie Casey](https://www.melaniecasey.com/products/clear-water-ring)

### Kinn Solis Ribbed Ring Emerald Diamond

![Gold ribbed emerald diamond Taylor Swift inspired engagement ring from Kinn](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/2413aa0f-d3a2-4741-95f1-9fb70d64c966~rs_768.h-cr_150.407.879.1136)

_Photo: Kinn Studio_

While we know _Midnights_ as a pop album, its album art has a vintage, 1970s-inspired feel. If that aesthetic spoke to you (or your S.O.), allow us to introduce you to Kinn Studio's Solis ribbed ring. The retro vibe of this thick band gives off a cool mid-century modern vibe, while the emerald-cut center stone pops against the ridged setting. 

[From $3,280 | Kinn Studio](https://kinnstudio.com/products/solis-ribbed-ring-emerald-diamond)

## The Tortured Poets Department 

We're here to deliver a message straight from _The_ _Tortured Poets Department_. As your chairperson, we feel particularly equipped to bring you the best Taylor Swift-inspired engagement rings for this literary, dark academia-esque era. 

### Anna Sheffield Bea Arrow Ring

![Grey moonstone and champagne diamond arrow engagement ring inspired by Taylor Swift from Anna Sheffield](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/3b8eebb2-ec10-4e45-98f9-e430767a0cb2~rs_768.h-cr_65.71.821.827)

_Photo: Anna Sheffield_

Symbolism aside, you can't tell us this ring isn't a near-perfect dupe for the album cover of _The Tortured Poets Department_. A milky gray moonstone sits between two clusters of twinkling round diamonds in the shape of an arrow. Who are we to fight the alchemy? This ring is the perfect pick for your _TTPD_ -obsessed lover, so don't spend a fortnight deliberating—snag this proposal piece ASAP. 

[$2,450 | Anna Sheffield](https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&u=1030781&m=117673&afftrack=-taylor-swift-inspired-engagement-rings&urllink=www.annasheffield.com%2Fproducts%2Fin-stock-bea-arrow-ring-14k-yellow-gold-grey-moonstone-8x6mm-champagne-diamonds)

### Catbird Fairy Light Curved Demi-Pavé Black Diamond Ring 

![Curved demi-pavé black diamond engagement ring inspired by Taylor Swift from Catbird](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/e77b1011-fda6-4688-aa62-dd3f3cb0e4d5~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1500.1500)

_Photo: Catbird_

Have you ever seen a photo of an albatross IRL? The bird, which inspired a song on the _TTPD_ anthology tracks, has a white body with black wings—and this stacking band from Catbird has the same energy. While not necessarily an engagement ring, we love the idea of pairing your main engagement ring with this stacking jacket for a pop of color (and as a nod to the Grammy-winning songstress).

[From $880 | Catbird](https://www.catbirdnyc.com/fairy-light-curved-demi-pave-black-diamond.html?306=164)

### Charles & Colvard Cushion Claw Prong Trillion Three-Stone Engagement Ring

![Three-stone diamond engagement ring inspired by Taylor Swift Charles & Colvard](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/04ebc2f1-79a2-44fb-b9dc-3fce256f5e36~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.600.600)

_Photo: Charles & Colvard_

Mark our words: Your fiancé will be down bad for a ring as stunning as this. (In a good way, of course!) Since _The Tortured Poets Department_ is the latest Taylor Swift era, it's only fair for us to pair it with one of the latest engagement ring trends. We've seen a rise in three-stone engagement rings because, let's be real—sometimes, more is more. In this lab-grown style, a pillowy cushion-cut center stone is flanked by sparkly trillion-cut side stones. Together, the gems create a look that's oh-so bright…dazzling. 

[From $2,629 | Charles & Colvard](https://charlesandcolvard.sjv.io/c/64733/1375212/16476?subId1=-taylor-swift-inspired-engagement-rings&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.charlesandcolvard.com%2Fproducts%2Fcushion-claw-prong-trillion-three-stone%2F)

## The Life of a Showgirl 

Although _The Life of a Showgirl_ doesn't drop until October 3, we already know this era is all about main character energy. If you're the type of person who wants your engagement ring to take center stage, these showstopping selections are the ideal interpretation of the most colorful Taylor Swift era yet. 

### Berlinger Jewelry Champagne Asscher Cut Diamond Mosaic Ring 

![Champagne Asscher Cut cluster engagement ring](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/c0c46179-a737-4657-a08b-98ff3532a8ac~rs_768.h)

_Photo: Berlinger Jewlery_

It's giving showgirl headpiece, no? If you're looking for an iconic engagement ring, this cluster design boasts sixteen baguette, carré and round brilliant cut diamonds surrounding a champagne-colored Asscher. It doesn't get flashier than that. 

[$15,250 | Berlinger Jewelry](https://berlingerjewelry.com/products/champagne-asscher-cut-diamond-mosaic-ring)

### Brilliant Earth Cassiopeia Opal and Diamond Ring

![Opal engagement ring ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/3e5af64a-f2ab-4ef2-b234-09ca2c7e9956~rs_768.h)

_Photo: Brilliant Earth_

Is "Opalite" about Travis Kelce's eyes? We don't know for sure yet, but if you're already obsessed with this song title, we recommend an opal engagement ring. This particular one from Brilliant Earth is flanked by small round diamonds on either side. 

[From $990 | Brilliant Earth](https://brilliantearth.sjv.io/c/64733/1041908/13541?subId1=TK-taylor-swift-inspired-engagement-rings&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brilliantearth.com%2FCassiopeia-Opal-and-Diamond-Ring-Gold-BE2OD088)

### Catbird Night at the Ballet Lab-Grown Diamond Ring 

![Emerald engagement ring in a halo](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/a10be4c9-cd05-4893-8915-27f2e2e8a4e1~rs_768.h)

_Photo: Catbird_

Emerald diamonds are known for their hall of mirrors effect, just like the mirrors that surround Taylor Swift in one of the many album art covers for _TLOAS_. Not only does this sparkly lab-grown engagement ring have a name that evokes showgirl energy, the constellation of starry brilliant diamonds will cast a mirrorball-esque glow everywhere you go...like a true showgirl.
