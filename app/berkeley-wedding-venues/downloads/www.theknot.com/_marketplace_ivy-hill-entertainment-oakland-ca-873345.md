We worked with Ivy Hill to select musicians for our ceremony / cocktail hour per our planner’s recommendation (planner was the amazing Denise of Denise Lillie Engagements). We wer...

e getting married on a vineyard and wanted the vibe of the wedding to be transporting. As such, we selected the two guitarists from the Yacht Club of Paris (we opted to only select the guitarists due to budgetary constraints, however, the trio comes with a bass player if that fits your budget). Ivy Hill was very flexible in allowing us to pick two of the three artists and still be able to create the joyous, uplifting vibe of French gypsy jazz. While we personally did not get to enjoy the music, we had selected specific songs for the ceremony and cocktail hour to help create the atmosphere we wanted. The only issue we had was the bridal entrance song. I had changed it a few days after submitting my initial selection. At this point, I was entirely going through my planner (rather than communicating directly with Ivy Hill). Unfortunately, the song did not get swapped out so I had to walk down the aisle to the wrong song (hence the four stars). This threw me off a bit but not much you can do at that point and ultimately, no one is paying that much attention to the music while you’re walking down the aisle. So while it was not ideal, I did want to mention to perhaps not do any last minute swapsies just in case the message gets lost in translation and does not get relayed to the artists (definitely not their fault as it was a communication breakdown). Other than that, all went well and I highly recommend them.

ll for our wedding, we choose the musician and DJ package. Their communication wasn’t great leading up to the wedding but that didn’t bother me too much. I had written to them the week before to confirm and finalize everything and they told me the musician we hired had to leave early for another gig, I brushed it off because it wasn’t even correct that we wanted him for the reception, so I clarified with them and moved on. Then at our wedding they played our wrong first dance song. A moment we can NEVER get back and we are still sad about to this day. The DJ apologized profusely and said that the playlist he got was incorrect, I showed him my emails to the company with the correct song clearly listed and he felt awful. I emailed the company to let them know after our wedding the mistake and that I was disappointed and theCEO/Founder, Matt Roads proceed to respond but not with an apology but with a defensive and nasty email saying that it was my fault, etc. and that I still had to pay, etc. Meanwhile I had never once said I wasn’t going to pay nor was I expecting not to. I responded to him and sent him email proof of the correct song we had requested and his response back to that was also not apologetic or sincere. Its not that hard to be a nice person or to apologize for your obvious mistakes but clearly it was for Matt Roads. Just a warning to future couples looking to hire. I should had taken my wedding planners DJ suggestions and not hired Ivy Hill.

ce to start if you're looking for someone who will care about your wedding experience, sound quality, and the music that becomes the soundtrack to your wedding moments! Brian Bergeron is a co-founder of IHE and picked up the call for our wedding. It was an honor working with him from the start. He jumped on an inquiry call with me even as he was away on vacation in Mexico at the time. Brian followed up with an excellent quote to help make our dreams happen and accommodated so many of our needs within budget - He wasn't selling to me as a client, he was partnering with me as a fellow musician who wanted to see a vision come to life. IHE partnered with Paul Thomas from A Sound Objective to ensure the most seamless and best quality ceremony we could have. As a fellow musician and audiophile, I was keen on having professional quality audio for our event from beginning to end. Paul and Brian took personal time on a weekday to conduct a detailed walk-through at the venue, assessed our sound needs, and communicated them clearly with me thereafter. They were not only transparent at every stage of the planning process, they also made great recommendations to ensure a top-notch quality experience for us and our guests. These guys are the real deal. They are professional, passionate, and genuinely kind people. Towards the end of our wedding, we announced we would be donating funds to a non-profit organization that fights to end domestic violence, in lieu of wedding favors. Paul approached us after the event and offered his professional services at no cost for the next event the organization needed help. Having done thorough vendor research for sound and music support for our wedding, I can honestly say we could not have found a better partnership. Ivy Hill Entertainment and A Sound Objective truly helped make our dream come true. They have my highest recommendation.

SO easy to work with and so organized. I'm pretty "Type A" and Brian was always one step ahead of me with every detail of our wedding weekend! Ivy Hill was one of my absolute favorite vendors we worked with for our wedding. We also had to reschedule our wedding date from October 2017 to March 2018 due to the Sonoma wildfires. Brian was so thoughtful and refunded our entire payment without us even having to ask. Clearly, we re-booked them for March once we had a new date set. Our only regret was spending too much time getting our photos taken after the ceremony and not enough time at the cocktail hour. We would have LOVED to heard more from The New Classics during our cocktail hour. Their music was beautiful and EXACTLY what we wanted on our wedding day. Thank you, Brian and everyone Ivy Hill for being so wonderful and easy to work with! You are a very talented group of musicians!

y musician and Ivy Hill was the answer! Their business model is unique in that they are a collective of true artists. I love the idea of art patronage, and by hiring Ivy Hill, I was able to support talented local artists. Brian Bergeron was our initial point of contact who answered our many questions and listened to our needs. He was so enthusiastic and knowledgable, and he recommended Matt Roads as our DJ and Erma Kyriakos as our ceremony violinist. Both Matt and Erma were exceptional from our very first interaction all the way to their performance at our wedding. Matt requested some information from us prior to the wedding so that he could better understand our music taste and what type of atmosphere we were hoping to create. We were pretty exhausted with wedding planning, and so we were admittedly a bit vague with this information, and yet he was still able to pick up on the vibe we were after and play songs that we and our guests loved. He also kept the pace of the evening on track, working closely with our coordinator and other vendors to make sure the order of events ran smoothly. I'm not technical at all, but I'm sure there is a lot of work that goes into providing microphones and amplification for the ceremony and speeches, and all of that went off without a hiccup as well. Erma is a superb violinist who even learned a few modern songs that we really wanted played that weren't in her repertoire at the time. I will always remember the beautiful sound of her strings. I highly recommend Ivy Hill Entertainment, Matt Roads, Brian Bergeron, and Erma Kyriakos for all of your event entertainment needs.

Highly Recommended, Quality Entertainment: Wow - what a fantastic experience! Ivy Hill Entertainment truly is your “one stop music and entertainment shop.” From working in events, ...

I understand that heartfelt, professional, seamless entertainment is a key component to creating a memorable celebration. It brings people together, inspires guests, and sets the tone of your party. Ivy Hill Entertainment definitely stands out as the BEST. When it came time to plan the ultimate personal event - our wedding - we wanted a music-based celebration that stood apart from “typical wedding music”. The idea was a multi-musical-styled evening showcasing classical music, New Orleans Big Band, a roaming violinist at dinner (Ivy Hill’s gal, MJ, even played pop hits like Stayin’ Alive & had everyone singing!), an intimate pub sing-along, & finally a rockin’ reception. This was certainly an ambitious repertoire! I began researching bands/musicians & initially fell into a panic. Most bands didn’t seem to have the magical vibe, musical diversity, network, & professionalism (Can we count on the to show up for gods sake…) for me to book. In fact, none of the musicians resonated with our event’s style…. and then I found Ivy Hill Entertainment. WOW. Game changer. From the moment of contact to the actual execution we had an amazing experience that was fun, stress free, collaborative, easy, & QUALITY. Ivy Hill has many options on booking talent - actually super talent. You can hire anyone from a dope DJ to solo musician to the 9-musician “build-a-band” act we employed. My initial contact was Brian Bergeron who not only understood our vision, but encouraged us to make it happen. What an awesome guy. He was just as excited as we were! In fact, that’s what stands out about Ivy Hill - their passion for music & events. They truly love what they do & are honored to be part of your event. Ivy Hill also offers such quality musicians! I couldn't believe we had all these cool people playing our wedding! It was great to see their musical backgrounds & sound samples. For our wedding, they supplied everything from the sound technician, musical equipment, speakers, musicians, & even an amazing Bandleader extraordinaire: Jon Devoto. Man, this guy was incredible! In addition to coordinating the musicians, he was also the lead singer, MC… and as a special request, include some mind-blowing tap dancing. Everyone loved him! I wish I could go through each of the musicians (Debbie Ilana, the New Classics, MJs Brass Boppers) because they brought so much flavor & style. It was like a mini-musical festival. The best part is that whatever you decide to book - whether it be an intimate musical vibe, dope DJ, or full-blown band - they deliver a memorable performance and professional experience. This team is full of talent and heart. They also have a big network of musicians and DJs so you don’t need to worry about flaky musicians or no-shows. God forbid someone gets sick, they have the resources to ensure you are set. I trust them implicitly. I knew that I had nothing to worry about when booking them. The communication was clear and timely. We were in-line every step of the way. In fact, they are the only company I will use for future events. If you seek a top-notch service, this is the place for you. As you can see form their website, Ivy Hill Entertainment has a lot to offer. They exceeded our already high expectations. It is my pleasure to write this review and spread the word.

ull trio brought to life the magic and spirit of our wedding. The musicians learned Pearl Jam and Cat Stevens for our ceremony music and it was executed beautifully. The music during cocktail hour was perfect - soulful with a little blue grass vibe - it matched the venue and our vision as a couple. Our guest GUSHED over the trio. Brian was so helpful along the way in helping us organize the trio, focus on our music choices, and calm my anxious bride nerves. We couldn't recommend Ivy Hill Entertainment highly enough for any special occasion. As I told Brian after our wedding, my only wish is that I could've heard more of the trio before I walked down the aisle.

We loved working with Ivy Hill Entertainment for our wedding on July 1. They did the music and lights for us and we were so happy with their work. Matt Roads was our main contact ...

and one of our two DJs for the evening. He went above and beyond and did two site visits with us, which put us at great ease as we did a backyard wedding and were concerned about layout and electricity. We felt totally comfortable in his hands and he delivered! He was a very calming person to work with and was always happy to collaborate and answer questions throughout the process. He and DJ Marshall DJ'd the wedding and did and awesome job. They totally understood what were going for in the various soundscapes of the evening and supplemented our music choices amazingly. They got everyone dancing and were very good at making sure all generations felt comfortable and supported. I also love that Ivy Hill is all about supporting local musicians and it's not a way to just throw money at the wedding industry. Their attention to detail and personalizing the experience made this a wonderful experience, and we are so happy we went with them. They were just so nice and capable and cooperative, which was a real blessing during wedding planning. Support your local artists and book Ivy Hill! You won't be disappointed.

Let me first say, this review is LONG overdue (we got married in April 2016 in San Francisco!) yet the most deserved which so I couldn’t let any more time pass without writing it. ...

I will also preface this by saying that my husband is a music fanatic and was very picky in choosing musicians for our wedding. We were first drawn to Ivy Hill Entertainment by the vocals we saw of Brian on the website and he did not disappoint! We had Brian and Kyle play as a duo for our ceremony and cocktail hour as we wanted live music. During cocktail-hour they played almost entirely personal requests which we appreciated. They also played acoustically for our first dance which couldn’t have been more special. Overall, we felt they were perfect at blending and harmonizing both musically and stylistically into our wedding. Numerous guests raved about them and they couldn’t have done a better job in making our wedding day PERFECT! On another note, Brian was so easy to work with, professional and very responsive. I would highly recommend Ivy Hill Entertainment.

r run of the mill DJ experience for our wedding music. We were trying to stray from the cheesy DJ who plays YMCA, etc. What we found with Brian was the perfect mix of instrumentals on the guitar, singing during cocktail hour, pre-recorded music for the ceremony and then DJing for the reception. He was super easy to work with and had us fill out a detailed questionnaire to get an idea of what type of music we were into and what kind of vibe we wanted to create. He's a super talented musician, and many of our guests commented on how great our music selection was! We didn't have a wedding planner, so some things were a little bit unorganized and Brian did a great job following the timeline and at times having to wrangle guests/tell them multiple times where they were supposed to be :) We would 100% recommend using Brian and all of Ivy Hill Entertainment for your event or wedding!

Topline: Jefferson Bergey and Ivy Hill were the PERFECT choice for our wedding’s musical needs. We highly recommend them! Jefferson initially came to us via a recommendation from ...

our planner (Monica Stickley of So Eventful). And after a quick phone call, it was clear that he was the right person to bring our shared vision of the day’s soundtrack to life. He has an array of musical talent, including playing guitar (among other instruments, I would venture to guess), singing, and DJing. From the very beginning of our engagement with Jefferson, he was 100% dialed in to our event. He took the time to ask all the right questions about our musical tastes, talked at length about mood and flow of the day, and treated each section as an individual experience - ceremony, cocktail hour, dinner and dancing. He graciously made time for calls, in person meetings, etc., and we never felt like he was out of touch or too bothered to spend a few minutes speaking with us. As the day of our wedding grew nearer, we realized how fortunate we were to have Jefferson on our team. As for the day itself, Jefferson was a rock star. He played a beautiful acoustic piece during our ceremony, in tandem with a violinist. The two of them went on to play a full accoustic set during cocktail hour for our guests. Though we missed it due to pictures, everyone we’ve asked has raved about the cocktail hour music. During dinner, Jefferson curated a great playlist of background music to add an atmosphere to our dinner. The playlist included a number of our parents’ favorites - which meant a lot to us and to them. And last but not least, the dancing, where Jefferson switched into full DJ mode. From the moment he played the first song, the dance floor was packed. Jefferson applied the perfect mix of tempos to keep us and our guests fully engaged throughout. He also added a couple of perfectly timed surprises inspired by the collective vibe - a great touch that showed just how much he was a part of the evening, not just running a playlist on auto-pilot. In the days that followed, we wanted to relive the magic of the dancing. So I sent Jefferson an email asking if he, by chance, had kept a list of the songs played. And if so, could I have it so we might recreate it. A couple of days passed, and then Jefferson made our day once again. Rather than sending us a list of songs, he sent us complete Spotify playlists of not just the dancing, but the dinner and cocktail hour as well! I could go on, but instead I’ll just sum it all up by saying that if you are considering Jefferson for your event, stop what you are doing and lock him in. You simply won’t find a better musical partner, musician or DJ out there. And a quick note about Ivy Hill. We worked with Brian Bergeron to book everything. He was professional, responsive and accommodating - everything we could ask for in a rep. Brian was also instrumental in helping find the right additions to our music team. From recommending a violinist to perform with Jefferson during our ceremony, to a finding sound technician with the right experience, Brian’s guidance was invaluable.

e I knew I had found the right company for us. My future husband of course insisted I shop around a little more and after I did, I knew my first choice was the best choice. They were extremely professional, provided music questionnaires in a timely manner, and answered any and all questions. Originally they had offered to do the lighting for our wedding as well at an extremely good rate and when as a company they decided to go in another direction with the lighting business, they still upheld their commitment to us at the price agreed and coordinated everything without a hitch. We did recorded music during the ceremony provided by Matt who also DJ'ed the reception. He had such great energy and really understood the direction and experience we were trying to create. All of our guests kept saying how happy they were with the song selection and the dance floor remained busy the entire reception. We had a wedding of 72 and everyone danced the night away. If you are looking for a professional DJ and a company that really knows how to do their job right, Ivy Hill is the place for you.

Matt didn't skip a beat and managed to find an amazing violinist who learned several songs for us and at a great price.

Brian and Jon are true professionals and very talented. They will work with you and make valuable suggestions. They have a deep repertoire which was great to choose from, and they'll also learn any song you want. Last but not least, I would also hire Brian and Jon for other events larger or smaller than just a cocktail hour. I have no doubt they can customize and put together a group of whatever you want and perform at a high level. Looking forward to hiring them again down the line.

When we transitioned inside for dinner and dancing, his DJ-ing expertise was top notch, highlighting a great mix of hits for both the older and younger party guests to enjoy, while the smooth musical transitions kept everyone on their feet until the end of the evening.
