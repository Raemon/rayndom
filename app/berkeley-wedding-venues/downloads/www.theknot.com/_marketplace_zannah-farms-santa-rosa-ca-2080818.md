Do yourself the biggest favor, and CHOOSE ZANNAH FARMS!! We hired Zannah Farms as our wedding florist, and from our very first conversation, Ashley was an absolute dream to work wi...

th. She understood my vision EXACTLY, and her and her team executed it PERFECTLY! On top of Ashley's complete understanding and amazing communication, she heard all of the details that another florist could have completely overlooked. Down to including passion flower vines in my bouquet, which was such a small mention on my part in our conversations when I told her just how much I loved that one of my inspiration photos had used them, and she was able to include them in my absolutely GORGEOUS bouquet! She was able to help us keep within our budget by selecting and providing us with beautiful bulk greenery, and guided and directed us in DIYing the dreamy forest of green I had imagined on our reception tables, signs, and memorial table. Then, her and her team came in with a bunch of buckets of white florals, extras, and expertise to make everything SO absolutely perfect, and so absolutely STUNNING. From the arch pieces to the meadow boxes, from the bouquets to the boutonnieres, from the corsages to the flower girl petals, I literally could not have asked for anything more. The pieces that they created and installed were beyond words beautiful, and the way they helped us help them complete the rest was so unbelievably special, helpful, and an incredibly unique experience for us, for our bridal team, and for our family. Zannah Farms is the ABSOLUTE BEST and I cannot recommend them enough! They offer impeccable services, with stunning florals, at amazing prices, and all with an absolutely priceless ability to hear out their client and execute exactly what they are wanting. Thank you, Ashley and the Zannah Farms team, so so so much. You all made our wedding day SO ABSOLUTELY PERFECT!!!
