We had the absolute best experience with Ardi as our wedding DJ (We hired him to MC and DJ our reception as well as DJ our after party at a different venue)! From the very beginnin...

g, he was incredibly responsive and made the entire planning process feel easy and fun. He didn’t just ask us for a playlist — he took the time to really understand our vision. He walked us through each genre and sub-genre of music, asking for examples of artists and songs we loved, and then wove those into the night seamlessly. On the wedding day, Ardi was both professional and energetic. He set the perfect tone for every moment — from cocktail hour, to dinner, to getting everyone out on the dance floor. He knew when to bring the energy up and when to keep things flowing smoothly. He mixed between songs beautifully, honored our requests, and kept the transitions between events (cake cutting, first dance, etc.) effortless with clear and professional announcements. The technical side was also excellent. The sound quality was excellent and his lighting added a really fun vibe to the dance floor. We had multiple guests comment on how great the music was, and the dance floor stayed full all night. We also appreciated that he uploaded our After Party set to SoundCloud without asking. We can’t recommend Ardi enough — he truly exceeded our expectations and played such a big role in making our wedding unforgettable. If you want a DJ who is professional, communicative, and genuinely invested in making your wedding amazing, Ardi is the one!

We hired Ardi as our DJ/MC for our wedding, and he exceeded every expectation we had. From the very first meeting, we were blown away by how organized, professional, and genuinely ...

invested he was in making our day perfect. We gave him a handful of artists and genres we loved, and he somehow curated a playlist that felt like he had known our music taste for years. He was an incredible MC. Warm, confident, and perfectly attuned to the flow of the night. He kept the energy high from start to finish and transitioned each moment seamlessly. Our guests were on the dance floor all night, and so many people told us afterward how amazing the music was. What we appreciated most was how much we trusted him, and he delivered ten times over. Every cue, every transition, every song choice was timed perfectly. He read the room effortlessly and created the exact vibe we dreamed of. If you’re looking for a DJ/MC who is talented, professional, easy to work with, and truly cares about making your event unforgettable, Ardi is the one. We can’t recommend him enough.

Ardi recently played our wedding on 10/4/25 and we cannot say enough positive things! As a music loving couple, we hoped to find the perfect DJ who could balance our love for EDM w...

ith a mix of genres our guests would enjoy- and he exceeded our expectations! We gave him an inspiration playlist but we ultimately trusted him to use his musical expertise and experience to play for the crowd. He was able to perfectly blend a range of genres throughout the night from EDM, disco, Motown, Spanish, reggaeton, pop, 90s dance and hip-hop. The dance floor was packed at all times and we received so many compliments on the DJ from our guests. He also agreed to transition to a silent disco after 10pm, which was a huge hit! Ardi, we can’t thank you enough for bringing the energy, good vibes, and carefully curating the soundtrack to the best day of our lives. We couldn’t have picked a better DJ and emcee for our wedding. 10/10 would recommend Ardi's services to anyone!

Ardi performed a sound check before, but once the live performances began, he let the performer be the center of attention while providing all the technical support. Throughout the event, he did a great job of announcements and helped us keep to our schedule. When the reception really kicked off with the dancing, he was in tune with the guests on the dance floor, matching the music to the vibe in the room. We would definitely hire him again for future DJ needs!

I let Ardi know the kind of music I wanted to play at different portions of the night with certain types of songs and he nailed it with his own playlists in each portion. We had lots of guests tell us how much fun they had dancing the night away. We appreciated his professionalism and ongoing communication. Easy to get lighting packages through him as well. Ardi was my favorite vendor to work with! Highly recommend Ardi and his craft. One of my bridesmaids also booked him for her wedding a year later and needless to say he brought the same great energy and good vibes.
