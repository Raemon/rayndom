Guest books are a timeless wedding tradition, but you don't have to follow the status quo of using an _actual_ book if that's not your style. A wedding guest book alternative gives you the best of both worlds: a great way to remember your day and the loved ones who were present while you celebrated, combined with a unique idea that feels true to your personalities. (Although if you _are_ interested in a traditional guest book, [The Knot Invitations](https://www.theknot.com/paper/ceremony-reception/guest-books) offers an array of options that you can filter by style, color theme, season and more.) 

You might have come across some popular guest book alternatives, like messages in a bottle or instant photos, but we're sharing even more unique wedding guest book ideas, from [digital guest books](https://www.theknot.com/content/digital-guest-book) to DIYs. Set up one of these creative options next to your reception venue entrance or wedding gift table so guests can spot it right away. _Psst,_ don't forget to save the ideas you love from this article to [Your Favorites](https://www.theknot.com/your-favorites/inspiration) folder on The Knot by clicking the heart icon on any of the images below.

## **Unique Wedding Guest Book Alternatives**

Part of planning the best wedding ever is filling it with the best wedding details ever. That's where these unique wedding guest book ideas come into play. From trending audio guest books to custom pet portraits, we love these standout wedding guest book alternatives.

### **1\. Vintage Phone Audio Guest Book**

![Vintage phone wedding guest book alternatives](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/8204ca10-5907-4cf0-ba06-87fa64470f21~rs_768.h-cr_0.479.1080.1559)

_[Photo: This Modern Romance](https://thismodernromance.com/)_

Talk about an out-of-the-box idea (literally). Guests spoke their well wishes into a phone at this wedding via an [audio guest book](https://www.theknot.com/content/audio-guest-book), and the newlyweds ended the wedding reception with a recording they could listen to for years to come. (You can also consider a [video guest book](https://www.theknot.com/content/video-guest-book) if you're interested in going the digital route!)

### **2\. Illustrated Pet Portrait**

![Guest writing on guest book sign with picture of dog](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/0f7901e1-5f4a-4d17-9198-8558ed34d4ee~rs_768.h-cr_0.69.675.744)

While some couples will pen handwritten notes to their attendees and set them at each guest's table setting, this couple turned that tradition on its head. Guests were encouraged to write a note to the newlyweds and then tie it to a branch on a beautiful wishing tree.

### **4\. Baseballs**

![baseballs sitting on wood blocks](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/59f4711f-fa90-4606-aa03-d7b8e484c200~rs_768.h-cr_0.234.1080.1314)

Ask guests to sign their well wishes onto postcards like these newlyweds did. The postcards can be collected from places you've visited together, feature an image that has personal significance, like a favorite food or animal or be a custom photo of the two of you.

### **6\. Colorful Piñata**

![piñata guest book on wood farm table in greenhouse](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/ad0fd324-1677-47ff-920f-55d4250f96c1~rs_768.h-cr_0.160.675.835)

_[Photo: Avonné Photography](https://www.avonnephotography.com)_

### **8\. Quilt Square Coloring**

_[Photo: Katie Edwards Photo](https://www.katieedwardsphoto.com)_

Guests at this event used fabric pens to decorate quilt squares that bore an uncanny resemblance to adult coloring book pages. After the special day, the squares were sewn together into a keepsake quilt.

## **Interactive and Creative Wedding Guest Book Alternatives**

### **9\. Retro Vinyl Records**

_[Photo: Jeremy Chou Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/jeremy-chou-photography-rancho-cucamonga-ca-497551)_

Each guest signed mini wooden hearts before dropping the chips into an acrylic shadow box-like frame.

### **11\. Custom Caricature Picture**

![Caricature picture guest book](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/38eed2d8-03a5-4e73-a573-2c5caec87839~rs_768.h)

_[Photo: Britt DeZeeuw Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/britt-dezeeuw-photography-breezy-point-mn-987504)_

One couple commissioned a custom caricature, around which guests left well wishes for the couple. While doable at any size, we think this is a great guest book alternative for a small wedding.

### **12\. Instant Camera**

![Table with pens and Polaroid cameras](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/97b9fa3d-5d13-4038-b91f-1dcf8aa9c1f9~rs_768.h)

_[Photo: By Julieta](https://www.byjulieta.com)_

Since it will take a few weeks for your professional photographer to edit your wedding photo album, instant snaps from the day are a great option for couples who want to be able to reminisce immediately following the wedding day via a DIY [Polaroid wedding guest book](https://www.theknot.com/content/polaroid-wedding-guest-book). Additionally, consider integrating this guest signing book idea with your photo booth so guests could take one picture home with them and leave another one for you to keep.

### **13\. Ski-Themed Illustration**

![Ski-themed guest book sign on easel](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/82042b6f-784c-4999-b961-c2ca01aeedab~rs_768.h-cr_0.61.736.1042)

_[Photo: Rodeo & Co. Photography](https://rodeoandco.com)_

This couple had their stationer print a wedding sign with ski-themed illustrations that matched the rest of the stationery for their snowy winter wedding. After guests signed the border, the framed piece was ready to be hung in the couple's newlywed home.

### **14\. Illustrated Hometown Sign**

![Michigan-inspired guest book picture](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/afe486b2-d716-439a-9b9c-a78b5b0aa4d4~rs_768.h-cr_13.0.666.490)

_[Photo: Heidi Uhlman](https://heidiuhlman.com)_

Since a guest book is supposed to commemorate your wedding, it's a great idea to include a nod to your wedding destination, hometown, wedding date or even your monogram as part of the guest book.

### **15\. Acrylic Sign**

![acrylic sign guest book](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/c4ff69e7-a27e-4047-af9e-a995fd599d57~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.675.900)

![Painted globe guest book and acrylic sign](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/d115ad5e-91e8-4a06-b116-0f904b98dc79~rs_768.h-cr_0.225.675.900)

_[Photo: Jenny DeMarco Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/jenny-demarco-photography-austin-tx-380666)_

What better for a destination wedding guest book alternative than a globe? The best part about a globe guest book is that it can fit any wedding style or aesthetic. If travel is central to your love story, have a globe guest book that can become home decor in your new home. You could even have guests mark destinations they think belong on your travel bucket list.

## **Fun Guest Book Alternatives**

Featuring fun ideas from board games to pottery, these ideas for guest signing at weddings will leave a lasting wedding memory for both you and your friends and family.

### **17\. Deck of Cards**

![Deck of cards wedding guest book alternative](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/daab7963-8326-46c4-9b06-bf8e7988849c~rs_768.h-cr_0.334.2000.2334)

_[Photo: In Bianco e Nero](https://www.inbiancoenero.com/)_

Celebrate being lucky in love with this fun guest book idea! Lay out a couple of decks of cards (1-3 should do the trick, depending on how many guests you have) with a few markers and encourage guests to sign their names and well wishes on the face side. Next time you play a game of poker or blackjack, you'll be able to shuffle through all the great advice. Bonus: Create custom decks featuring pictures of you and your S.O. on one side, with lines on the other, making it even easier for guests to leave a message.

### **18\. Vintage Dictionary**

![Vintage dictionary wedding guest book alternatives](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/6b34b610-3f24-4fbd-b3cc-d8a9dbb3cf75~rs_768.h-cr_0.150.1331.1481)

_[Photo: Charlotte Jenks Lewis Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/charlotte-jenks-lewis-photography-brooklyn-ny-580741)_

For a bookish couple, a vintage dictionary is the way to go. Guests find a word that describes the newlyweds or one that's related to their own relationship with them, like an inside joke or special memory. It'll look beautiful on display and can be tucked away on a shelf until you need to look up a word...or take a stroll down memory lane.

### **19\. Pot Signing**

![Pot signing alternative guest book ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/14145baf-61bc-40c6-94c3-627102f23028~rs_768.h-cr_0.728.1458.2186)

_[Photo: Alicia Lucia Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/alicia-lucia-photography-bernalillo-nm-784294)_

A wedding is all about beginning a new journey—and what better thing to symbolize that than a plant! Loved ones can sign a pot (or two!) as a guest book alternative. Later, the couple can plant a few seeds and watch their flowers (and love!) bloom.

### **20\. Wooden Block Pieces**

![Jenga wedding guest book alternative ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/25f25a84-97a8-4462-9288-1ea3571071c6~rs_768.h-cr_84.0.1381.973)

_[Photo: IJ Photo](https://www.ijphoto.net/)_

Want to make your next game night memorable? Use Jenga or a tumbling tower game as your guest book alternative. Wedding attendees will sign game pieces and share a word of advice or funny anecdote. At the end of the night, you can even set up a game to play!

### **21\. Signed Guitar**

![Vintage guitar wedding guest book alternative ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/0853bbf1-48ad-4fd3-859d-772334d7ddf0~rs_768.h-cr_242.0.1215.973)

_[Photo: Derek Chad Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/derek-chad-photography-san-marcos-ca-639149)_

Newlyweds who love music should consider using a guitar as a cool guest book idea. Attendees can sign their name, write a message or share a song lyric or album that reminds them of the happy couple.

### **22\. Jigsaw Puzzle**

![Jigsaw puzzle wedding guest book alternative ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/1c2178d9-73c7-4d13-99b9-be58224d664b~rs_768.h-cr_0.243.1458.2187)

_[Photo: Anastasiia Photography](https://anastasiiaphotography.com/)_

Make every guest feel like a piece of your love story with this fun puzzle guest book alternative. For this one, we recommend having a custom puzzle made (a heart shape or one that features a photo of the couple, for example) with slightly larger pieces for guests to sign their name or write a message.

### **23\. Paper Plane**

![Paper plane wedding guest book](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/4c436c46-aa82-4923-8853-35fcb37e52f4~rs_768.h-cr_0.59.1458.2003)

_[Photo: Anna Lee Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/anna-lee-photography-los-angeles-ca-865524)_

Let your love take flight with this fun and interactive wedding guest book idea. Once guests sign the paper planes, collect them and frame your favorites as 3-D mementos, or unfold them and bind them into a [keepsake guest book](https://www.theknot.com/content/21-guest-books-that-make-great-keepsakes).

## **Beach Wedding Guest Book Alternatives**

If you're hosting a beach wedding, turn to original wedding guest book ideas like wooden surfboards, seashells and other coastal-inspired elements.

### **24\. Tropical Surfboard**

At this destination big day in Hawaii, the couple paid homage to getting engaged while surfing by asking attendees to sign a surfboard.

### **25\. Adirondack Chairs**

_[Photo: Kelly Cronin Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/-kelly-cronin-photography--harwich-ma-417756)_

Live out your best coastal grandmother-inspired life by having guests sign a pair of white Adirondack chairs on the wedding day. Once you've applied weatherproof sealer to protect the signatures, set up the chairs in your backyard for your new favorite spot to unwind together (with glasses of wine in hand, of course).

### **26\. Canoe Oars**

![Wood oar guest book](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/ad4e1749-5147-476d-a4d5-76dd05c76bb9~rs_768.h-cr_0.63.675.738)

### **27\. Assorted Seashells**

Once guests have added their names, this vintage-inspired life preserver would look so interesting as framed wall decor in a nautical-themed space.

### **29\. Messages in a Bottle**

![message in a bottle alternative wedding guest book idea](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/c4125009-3791-440a-b3a6-152a3aada631~rs_768.h-cr_0.580.3474.5212)

### **30\. Wood Plank**

### **33\. Anniversary Wine Bottles**

![alternative wedding guest book idea anniversary wine bottles with custom labels](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/1684b560-c732-4ff0-a11e-d64c25971d0b~rs_768.h-cr_0.847.2334.3181)

_[Photo: Lauren Fair Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/lauren-fair-photography-pennsburg-pa-396575)_

Instead of pulling your guest book out every year, you can reminisce by reading notes and well wishes written onto wine bottles (or other bottles) designated for your major wedding anniversaries. Another option: Designate the bottles for future marriage milestones, like purchasing a new home or welcoming a baby.

### **34\. Miniature Wooden Barrel**

![miniature wine barrel as alternative wedding guest book idea](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/d8fa35a0-17de-4a80-a357-1e80403500de~rs_768.h-cr_0.495.2000.2495)

  * **Thrift and antique stores** : While customizing a wedding guest book alternative is a way to personalize it, it's not the only way to have a truly unique wedding feature. We recommend searching thrift shops, antique stores and donation centers for some of these wedding guest book ideas, especially ones like the guitar, vintage dictionary or pot—you may even get lucky and find an Adirondack chair or oars (you'd be surprised!). Plus, if you go shopping as a couple or with your wedding party, it can create another special memory.
