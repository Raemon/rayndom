The e-commerce shop has its own weddings division, and there are more than 150 styles of bridal shoes on offer, with a large majority ringing in under $50.

## Where to Buy Affordable Wedding Shoes

While fancy department stores and designer boutiques have their place, it's the internet we're turning to for affordable wedding shoes. Dozens of e-retailers have entered the market, and there is enough inventory to sift through and find options that are—in addition to being reasonably priced—also high quality and fashion-forward. Here are our top nine spots to shop. 

  * [**ASOS**](https://www.asos.com/us/women/)**:** In addition to the classics, look to ASOS for party-ready and playful bridal shoes. Think: high-shine metallics, lace-up designs, butterfly detailing and more to pair with reception and after-party looks. 
  * [**Birdy Grey**](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=9ibcrDa*U1o&mid=44848&u1=TK-affordable-wedding-shoes&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.birdygrey.com): Launched as an affordable bridesmaid dress retailer, Birdy Grey has recently expanded to include menswear and suiting for the wedding party, after-party looks for the bride and even shoes. Their footwear is understated and no-frills; though most options ring in around $60, at the time of publication, all were discounted to between $19 and $21.
  * [**DSW**](https://dsw.am3t9s.net/c/64733/315836/4837?subId1=TK-affordable-wedding-shoes&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dsw.com)**:** Long lauded as a top choice for affordable footwear of all kinds, DSW also boasts a stellar selection of discount bridal shoes. Check out labels like Kelly & Katie, Sam Edelman, Jessica Simpson, Betsey Johnson and Dolce Vita, in particular.
  * [**Etsy**](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6220&awinaffid=565019&campaign=tk-affordable-wedding-shoes%20&platform=dl&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2F%3Fref%3Dlgo): While you may have to dig a little deeper to find the diamonds in the rough, there are lots of affordable bridal shoe options on this online marketplace. (Read reviews, and shipping and return policies before making a purchase.) We especially love the site for beach brides: Affordable sandal options and lacey "naked" shoes abound. 
  * [**JJ's House**](https://www.jjshouse.com/?country): The online retailer is known for its affordable takes on everything in the wedding-fashion world, from flower girl dresses and mother-of-the-bride attire to the wedding dress itself. Footwear is no exception: The site offers a wide variety of styles under $75. 
  * [**Lulus**](https://lulusfashionloungellc.sjv.io/c/64733/1810759/21545?subId1=TK-affordable-wedding-shoes&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lulus.com%2Fbridal%3Fsubsite%3Dbridal)**:** Since launching its dedicated Wedding Shop, the e-retailer has become our go-to for inexpensive wedding shoes, whether for the bride, bridesmaids or guests. There's something for every style, from sky-high platform heels to bridal beach flats, with most falling under the $50 mark. Oh, and we tested them for comfort: Lulus shoes pass the dance test. **Use code THEKNOT20 for 20% off your first purchase.**
  * [**Nina Shoes**](https://www.ninashoes.com/)**:** With a 70-year history, this footwear brand specializes in special occasion shoes, including bridal, at reasonable price points. It also offers dress shoes for girls so you can outfit your flower girls, plus satin handbags and more. 
  * [**Nordstrom Rack**](https://howl.link/jfxltcwgurm0g?article_name=The+Knot&article_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheknotww.com%2F1754916569383?u1=TK-affordable-wedding-shoes)**:** The discounted division of behemoth department store Nordstrom Rack is a stellar place to find affordable bridal shoes, but you'll want to start your search earlier and keep checking back, as their inventory changes constantly; often, only one or two sizes of a certain style are available. If you live near a brick-and-mortar location, you can shop in person, too. 
  * [**Quince**](https://goto.quince.com/c/64733/1835359/21926?subId1=TK-affordable-wedding-shoes&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.quince.com)**:** The site has gone viral for its deals on dupes, but the quality stands up to its reputation. While you might not immediately think of Quince for bridal, basics are its bread-and-butter, so there are many classic shoes in nude and ivory tones on offer that work beautifully for the big day.
