I can't believe it has taken me this long to write this review. Elaine Bell Catering was a dream to work with. I would normally say run don't walk to book them for your wedding but...

sadly at the end of this year they will be closing their doors. Jennifer was wonderful to work with answering all our questions and helping make our wedding food the best food at a wedding I've ever had. We still get compliments to this day on how amazing the food was. They took our ideas and ran with them really making the food unique and special to us. Our goal was to not have traditional wedding food. We wanted something with a bit of whimsy that was seasonal and local. Let me tell you the nailed the brief and everything was so good!

We had a great experience using EBC on our wedding day in October 2023. Krystina was fantastic to work with, helping us to accommodate requests, feedback, and dietary restrictions....

All of our guests commented on how excellent the food was, including our oyster bar, passed apps, and charcuterie station. They did a great job on the custom drinks too. Thank you to Krystina and the whole EBC team for making our wedding day so special and delicious.

Krystina Orona and Jason Ghiselin deserve 5 stars each. They were incredibly responsive throughout the whole process and helped us put together a beautiful wedding. The food also...

gets 5 stars in presentation and flavor. All our guests were raging about their meals. Krystina allowed us to go with a flexible option where people could order on the spot because we did not ask people what they would like beforehand and our guests loved that. A downside which I think has room for improvement and to no fault of Krystina, was that the day of the wedding, myself and my husband were completely forgotten about. No one refilled our water or asked us if we wanted a drink or even if everything was ok. The servers were people we never really saw. I think it would be good to train the banquet staff to pay attention to the bride and groom and their needs. We weren't hard to miss, I had a huge poofy white dress. The other thing was we purchased an amazing dessert bar that all our attendees loved however the catering team never brought out cake. We bought so much cake from a very pricey vendor because we loved it so much but it mostly went uneaten. I wish someone had had the initiative to serve it at least at the table. It was so upsetting to get in the car after the wedding and find four large boxes of cake waiting for us. We went on our honeymoon immediately after and most of the cake went to waste sadly. I would still hire Elaine Bell catering again because of Krystina and Jason, but would strongly have this conversation with them to ensure these mistakes did not happen again.

We are so glad we hired Elaine Bell Catering for our wedding in June!!! As farmer's market enthusiasts and devout home cooks, we had our hearts set on serving a locally-sourced, co...

lorful, seasonal, and produce-forward menu that celebrated this region's magnificent bounty! We were intent on serving our guests the most fresh, delicious, beautiful, and perfectly prepared food possible, and Elaine Bell absolutely delivered!!! We received many many compliments from our guests who were completely blown away by the quality of the food, the masterful preparation, and the gorgeous presentation. There was widespread consensus that this was by far the best meal our guests had ever had at a wedding! We appreciated working with Krystina, who was always organized, detailed, and responsive to our questions and requests. She understood and supported our needs intuitively and was flexible and accommodating throughout the entire planning process. It was so helpful that Elaine Bell supplied our glassware, dinnerware, and bartending services as well -- it relieved us the trouble and cost of additional rentals and vendors. The service on the day of the wedding was lovely, attentive, and completely professional. We cannot recommend Elaine Bell highly enough! THANK YOU!!!

Where to start with EBC! I suppose from the beginning and our first call with Jennifer... She was enthusiastic about their offerings all the while curious about our style and what ...

exactly we were looking for on our special day. The meal options to choose from were extensive, but Jennifer appropriately guided us to selections that she felt would suit our wishes and our style. Then came the tasting, which was a blast! Full portions so we could see the plating and they were open to a few modifications. Jennifer made suggestions for welcome beverages and a few other details that we hadn't even considered, which was much appreciated. We chose a plated dinner for our 75 guests, and the fact that EBC prepares each plate onsite was a huge advantage to other caterers. When it came to our big day, we couldn't have been more pleased. The staff was warm and welcoming, professional and polite. Everything went smoothly with the dinner and they even packaged us a few pieces of our cake that we unfortunately forgot to go eat during the reception! EBC is a first class caterer in the wine country region. Thank you to Jennifer and the EBC for helping to make our special day so wonderful!

When looking for caterers, we were relieved to find Elaine Bell. Their food looked phenomenal (and trust me, it is!), but they also offered full services to meet all our needs and ...

simplify our wedding planning considerably. Instead of finding a baker, wait-staff, flatware, bartenders, etc. - Elaine Bell had us covered. Their service and professionalism was phenomenal- they were consistently attentive to our guests and the ever shifting goings-on between ceremony and reception. We had a full charcuterie table, hand selected dinner buffet and 2-tier cake with assorted baked treats and every bite was beautifully displayed and tantalizingly delectable. I would go with Elaine Bell 100 times over.

We had a great experience with Elaine Bell! They did a really great job seeing through the vision of food for our wedding, we opted for food stations rather than plated meals, but ...

wanted them to be cute rather than buffet-like. The food was absolutely amazing when we tasted it in our process of selecting them. The night of I felt like things we're a bit different from how I remembered them, but then again the night was a blur!! Everyone loved their food, and generally I'd absolutely recommend them for anyone looking for a wedding caterer!

anted. Jennifer was always accommodating, creative, and also transparent with us. Our wedding was postponed one year due to Covid and she allowed us to have a second tasting as our ideas had changed for what we wanted. What we loved most about working with EB besides the amazing quality of food for our guests, was their experience really helping keep the wedding organized and flowing on-time. The EB service and bartender team were so fun and personable, several of our guests commented on how nice, great and speedy they were. And everything ran according to schedule. They even packed up some food or us to go after the wedding - which was beyond thoughtful. Thank you EB for making our wedding food and beverage dreams come to life

EB also went above and beyond with the service; they made sure that we (the bride & groom) got to try our own food and desserts despite being so busy on our day.

While I unfortunately didn't get the chance to eat a whole lot of the food at my wedding, I can say I sure heard a lot about how good it was from our guests, which is what matters ...

at the end of the day. We had a few special asks, which Elaine Bell handled with gusto (for instance a pastry bar with a variety of desserts), and the food I did get to try was all fantastic. What I would add beyond the food is that they were extremely conscientious throughout the night, ensuring that we had bites here and there, and drinks on hand if we needed them. They loaded in and out without issue and left the venue spotless on their departure. It is clear that this is not their first rodeo, or their 200th for that matter. These folks are pros, and the quality of their food and service displayed that.

stin was an absolute pleasure to work with, the food tasting was fantastic, and the food tasted almost exactly like the trial but at 50x the guest count. The cherry on top was that Dustin was able to ensure that as our late night snack, we had warm cookies and milk served on trays around the dance floor. They felt right out of the oven, to the point where the chocolate chips were warm and gooey and the milk was ice cold. Can't get much better than this! Thanks for making our day so incredibly memorable.

Can’t say enough good things. We worked with Jen and team for a 90 person private venue wedding in Sonoma. The food was INSANELY DELICIOUS truly my guests are still raving about it...

from apps to entres to the dessert bar! We were blown away from the tasting and they truly delivered the same quality day of. Wine country freshness farm to table at its finest. They even got fresh passion fruit for our signature cocktail… our guests were losing their minds lol! Elaine Bell built out a kitchen in our garage which was an impressive feat. Everything was so professional from install to service to clean up. And the staff, I can’t even begin to describe how lovely and gracious they were… they made my husband and I feel so special and loved, they were attentive and kind and charming. It is so worth the extra cost to hire a caterer who has their own non-seasonal staff… the service was impeccable. 10/10 recommend and would use them again. Thank you Jen and Elaine Bell team for making our wedding so special, we deeply appreciate you! -Katie and Daniel

It was a hectic day for me as the bride and was rainy and cold. They would come to my break room giving me hot tea, food, etc without asking. Also gave us a gift at the end of the wedding. I believe they are the best you can get for wedding catering.

an enjoyable time choosing our menu in their tasting room pre-covid and highly recommend the experience to anyone looking for a caterer for their wedding. We had a high expectation for the quality of the food and drink after our tasting, but were especially impressed with the serving staff the day of. They were professional and did a great job responding to requests from our guests. Overall, I’d happily use Elaine Bell catering again and would recommend them to any of our friends or family.

work with Elaine Bell because of their food options and cost. Our tasting was so informative, and Dana and her team were incredibly responsive to our comments. One of the dishes we eventually served at our wedding wasn't even at the tasting, but we had so much confidence in Dana that we told her to go ahead and have it served! On the wedding day, the service was absolutely phenomenal. I had read so much about the bride and groom sometimes not being able to enjoy their food, but Dana made sure herself that we had enough food at our table and was quick to produce another serving if we wanted it. Our experience with the Elaine Bell team from beginning to end was absolutely perfect -cannot recommend enough!

Words cannot do this place justice! Dana was so great to work with and on top of everything! The food was AMAZING. We did a Sunday brunch wedding and the waffles were to die for. ...

They paired it with a vanilla bean creme fresh/whipped cream and it was just out of this world. The waffles were the hit of the party.... as well as many other amazing dishes, like the loaded hash browns and the eggs Benedict, all amazing! Wish they had a restaurant so we could get the waffles whenever we wanted.

onths to schedule a tasting & would only let us taste 2 apps/1 salad/1 main, etc. and Elaine Bell (which we were told was a bit more expensive). 2 weeks before our trip out to California to take care of some vendor things & do a tasting, we decided that we couldn't be stuck with just the difficult caterer we'd been dealing with and needed another option, so we contacted Elaine Bell Catering. Jennifer T. could not have been more accommodating, responsive or wonderful in creating a custom menu for us in a short timeframe. Once she found out that we were an Italian-Peruvian couple, she sent us over a custom menu using flavors from our respective backgrounds and scheduled a tasting. We are SO glad that we decided to try out Elaine Bell. From the second we walked into the room where our tasting was, the entire setup was informative, beautiful and delicious. We got to see all of the silverware, drinkware and plating of each of our drinks, apps and dishes. The food was delicious and they had no problem with the small tweaks we made to their awesome menu. Best of all was they adjusted their pricing to relieve some of the difference between their total and the other caterer's. Honestly, whatever extra we paid was totally worth it. Throughout the process, Jennifer was responsive, informative and downright awesome to deal with. We didn't have to worry about anything at all because we knew she was on top of it. On the day of our wedding, everything went flawlessly - our guests are still raving about our food and I've heard from several of them that it was the best meal they've ever had at a wedding (and the doughnut machine was a HUGE hit that they absolutely loved). We served dinner family style and Elaine Bell was happy to accommodate extra servings when our guests requested them. The whole staff at our wedding, from the servers to the bartenders to the chefs, were amazing, fun and great with our guests. They even sent us home with a picnic basket with some goodies and cupcakes from our wedding :) I'd definitely recommend this caterer to anyone getting married in the Sonoma-Napa area. They were truly amazing - thanks Jennifer!

My stomach is growling as I write this. Elaine Bell catered our wedding on 6/14/19 and we simply could not have been more pleased with their service and FOOD. I mean, just check ...

out this menu: \- Salad of Baby Organic Greens with Balsamic Roasted Black Grapes, St. George White Cheddar, Spiced Black Walnuts, Fuji Apples, Balsamic Apple Cider Vinaigrette & Basil Oil \- Greek Roasted Chicken with Lemon, Garlic & Oregano \- Seared Salmon with Leek Pea Puree, Sweet Corn Fennel Ragout, Pickled Mustard Seed & Popcorn Shoots \- Tagliarini Salad with Pine Nuts, Lemon & Zucchini with Fresh Herbs & Lemon Herb Dressing \- Whole Roasted Rainbow Carrots with Honey Thyme Glaze \- Rustic Artisan Breads with Sweet Butter Guest after guest told us it was one of the best meals - and not just wedding meals - they've ever had. We also got RAVE reviews on the cheese display we had out during cocktail hour. The one minor complaint my husband had was that it took longer than expected to get the main courses out after the salad (we did a plated salad and family style for the rest), but it didn't seem to bother anyone else. We worked with Cara and she was organized, kind, and so responsive to our needs - no tomato for me, no meat for him, vegetarian for the cousin, add passed apps, take away passed apps, etc. Thank you, Elaine Bell staff, for everything! Highly recommend!

Our wedding was an absolute dream and to say everything went as planned would be a massive understatement. My wife and I can't thank Dustin and his team enough for their attention to detail, listening to, understanding and executing our vision and for making our special day the most incredible wedding.

Everything came out on time, hot, and tasting as good as it did when we did our tasting months earlier. They prepared all food from scratch onsite at the venue (and we got married on a hill top in Sonoma with literally nothing but electricity available) so it was not an easy feet! They brought a mobile kitchen and got to work. We cannot thank Dustin and Elaine Bell Catering team enough for everything they did for us. It was truly the best day of our lives. I would recommend Elaine Bell to any of my friends and family. Use them if you have the chance!

Outstanding! Some of the best food I have ever had, and I'm a foodie. I had a very specific vision for the food at my wedding, an around the world theme with different stations. ...

I work in politics, and had had enough rubber chicken dinners to last a lifetime. After reading reviews, it seemed they had some experience with this. It was a destination wedding so I signed the contract before we had ever met or had a tasting and they exceeded every expectation. We ended up with taco, paella, Southern, and Asian stations. Richard was amazing to work with and kept me laughing the whole time. It was all amazing. EVERYONE raved about the food.

hat they don't charge for the tasting. I wanted some very specific things like a dim sum bar and hong kong style egg tarts - they definitely got it done. They actually found a dim sum restaurant in SF and managed to pick up all the dim sum for the cocktail hour. The only con I had was that the curry we chose was way too spicy. I'm sure had we done a second tasting it would have turned out differently. I'm not local so it was really difficult to schedule two tastings. We changed the menu pretty significantly after the first tasting and I wish I had stuck with the first menu, but that is definitely not their fault. Loved them.

I cannot recommend Elaine Bell to couples in the planning stages enough, and Richard is a must! He has worked with many brides and venues in the area, so comes well prepared with realistic and reasonable suggestions for your event's needs.

I wish I could give Elaine Bell 6 stars! They just catered my wedding a few weeks ago and were absolutely amazing. Literally every single guest raved about how incredible the food ...

was and how it was the best wedding food they've ever had. A lot of them are still talking about it! The food at weddings is rarely memorable and we felt really strongly about having delicious food everyone would love, especially since we were serving it family style and wanted our guests to be comfortable and have a great time. The presentation was beautiful and elegant and we couldn't have been happier. Richard was also so wonderful to work with throughout the entire process. He was always available to chat and talk through my ideas and I felt like he took my best interests to heart. The servers were so friendly and professional and they really made my vision come to life. Catering is such an important part of a wedding and they made everything so fun and perfect. I'm beyond grateful to Team Elaine Bell!

We used Elaine Bell for our wedding. We loved our tastings and our account manager. EBC was easy to work with and helpful in figuring out what all we needed for our venue. On t...

he day of, we received rave reviews on service... EBC's day-of manager really went out of his way to cater to our guests. However, we received mixed reviews on the food and felt that while the food was good, it wasn't as good as our tasting. The complaints we received largely had to do with certain dishes being under-cooked... and we noticed a bit of a lag in getting certain tables' entrees out. Overall, we were happy with EBC's services and I guess there is always someone who complains... but even my husband's food was a little under-cooked so that can't be entirely overlooked. Compared to the other vendors in the area, I still think they're the best choice. I'd note that your initial quote on price is likely not what you'll pay, as rentals etc get modified as the date gets closer and the price tends to increase.

We could not be happier with the food for our wedding. From our appetizers to our main entrees, everything was delicious.

Where do I begin? Thank god our planner brought us to EB. We thought we'd found the caterers the day prior to our meeting with them, but holy moly, thank goodness we waited to chec...

k EB out. We met Richard at the tasting and fell in love with him. The food was to die for (like Michelin star quality, truly) and the set-up was wonderful at the tasting. We were treated like royalty and even enjoyed a bottle of bubbly to celebrate. Throughout the menu planning process, Richard was nothing but helpful and supportive. Any question we had he was quick to answer and made all adjustments however we wanted them. We had stations and we kept getting compliments all night on how amazing the food was. And the staff was great, as well. The only "complaints" we had were the serving staff was too good -- drinks were placed on tables and they were swiped when people hadn't finished drinking them - ha! And a friend was bummed the food had been cleared because she hadn't had the chance to try something. Not bad complaints, really! Thank you, EB, for making our wedding truly an event to remember. I wish I'd gotten to enjoy more of the food but as the bride, it's always hard :)

Working with Elaine Bell was a dream come true. From just a simple online form I filled out, they came up with a wonderful sample menu for me that was the clear standout from othe...

rs I had received. Right away I could tell that they had the creativity and gourmet palate I was looking for. My contact was Mandy and she was a doll to work with. Being an out of town bride, I did a lot of my planning over the phone and via email, but Mandy was always great about responding quickly. By the time I met her for our tasting, I felt like we were old friends. We did the menu tasting a few months before the wedding and it was wonderful - I highly recommend doing this. We tasted every dish and got to make changes. They even served us a few alternative dishes just in case we didn’t like something and I actually loved one of the alternatives so much I swapped it out for one of my original selections. On the day of the wedding, the staff arrived on time and got straight to work setting up. Everyone looked very professional and the food was exquisite. I served an all vegetarian menu to a crowd of 65 and got nothing but rave reviews, even from the hard core meat lovers. It was that good! I would highly recommend Elaine Bell to any bride.

asting and fell in love with the food, but I expected it wouldn't be quite the same on the wedding day as they were cooking for 160 people. I was wrong. It was perfect. The filet was medium rare and came out warm and delicious, the glazed salmon was to die for. We have gotten more compliments from guests saying they have never had wedding food that amazing and over a month later they are still talking about it. The service was great and they executed it very well. It all just went so great! It was worth every penny...thank you Elaine Bell! Amber & John

d slipping. Response time started to lag and it became much harder to get a hold of our acct manager. The worst of it was that the day of event was chaotic and disorganized, even though we had walked through the property and all lay-outs and set up prior to the event. I am a very organized person and sent everything ahead of time, including a detailed timeline and setup list. Our acct manager said she would show up and didn't. They messed up our cocktails and the chefs were rude and curt tour guests. Unfortunately we didn't feel they were worth the money.

ails down to the signage for the bars. Mandy was available by email or phone and was always very quick and helpful with her responses to my questions. The actual day of the wedding, the staff was absolutely great. They were always there to pour wine or attend to a guests needs. We had a port and cigar bar at our wedding and somehow (minor detail haha) we forgot to purchase the port. The staff actually went to the store and purchased the port for us! I could not have been more impressed by this catering company and would highly recommend them to any couple getting married!

Our food tasting at Elaine Bell with Richard was a wonderful experience. Before our tasting we got to look over sample menus and food choices and ways of serving such as buffet vs....

seated meal. We told them ahead of time a few of the dishes we definitely wanted to try so we new ahead of time we were going to try things we already liked! The tasting went so well and we tried what we had wanted and some more great ideas they thought would be good choices too. We loved literally everything they brought out to us to try--it was all presented how it would be at the wedding so we knew how it would look for guests and it all tasted delicious. The food was JUST as we had seen at the tasting, thank goodness! As guests arrived for the ceremony there were bartenders with fresh lavender lemonade to handout to everyone. For the cocktail hour at our wedding we had some passed hors d'oeuvres such as mahogany duck on potato pancakes, mini sliders that actually fit in your mouth without being messy etc. as well as an oyster bar with a person to shuck them right on sight. There were also waitstaff passing silver platters of sparkling wine, white wine, and water for all the guests. I heard the oysters were a huge hit and all of the food was fully enjoyed. There was a perfect amount of waitstaff so no one waited in lines or felt like they had to search for food and drink. All our guests who have commented to us have said how well taken care of they felt at the wedding. For dinner, the food came out at a perfect temperature and even with 13 tables everyone was served at roughly the same time so no tables waited and waited for food. The guests had a choice of delicious halibut, black angus filet, or a curried vegetable dish that was so unique it made me a "non-vegeterian" order it for the my wedding meal! Every dish was beautifully presented, tasted divine, and big enough portions to fill up even our midwestern steak and potato guests. Oh and the started salad was fresh and not drowning in dressing even in the warm June evening of an outside wedding--how did they do that?! Finally alongside our cake from another vendor Elaine Bell had freshly fried beignets for our guests to go with the groom's father's side from New Orleans. They were apparently thoroughly enjoyed and my maid of honor said there was nothings but a million black plates covered in powdered sugar leftover. The service and food were top-notch. While a bit on the expensive side, that's really because we added a lot of our own requests such as an oyster bar and beignets. What a wonderful catering company. TOP QUALITY!
