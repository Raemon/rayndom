We had the absolute best time at Silverado! We got married at Silverado (the Grove) summer of 2023, and absolutely loved the resort as a wedding venue and space to host our guests ...

(nearly everyone came from out of town). The staff were so welcoming from day one, and Silverado provided our suite with thoughtful touches and surprises throughout our wedding weekend. Our wedding coordinator, Katie Records, was an absolute joy to work with — always super prompt with communication and willing to go above and beyond with everything including the last minute addition of patio umbrellas for a near 100 degree wedding day. Very few Napa wedding venues can offer the all inclusive experience of Silverado, with on site accommodations and above and beyond services, all in a beautiful setting. Highly recommend!

If you are looking for the perfect wedding day – look no further than Silverado! You’re treated like VIPs, not a paycheck, every step of the way. The resort set up was perfect for ...

our large wedding with a vast majority of attendees flying in from all over the US. Fantastic location, venue, and food. The staff is also exceptional! From dresses ripping and providing a needle and thread to clearing cars for the perfect pictures – they went above and beyond from the planning process to the execution. An extra special thank you to Katie Records and C-Y for taking care of everything we needed (even sometimes when we didn’t know we needed it!). We were a two-bride wedding and both felt like we were the only people on the resort & the most important wedding in the world! We highly recommend trusting Silverado.

r entire wedding weekend a huge success. It was everything we dreamed of and much much more. From hundreds of planning emails, to our menu tasting, first look location searches, a two-day golf tournament, to room block details, a special burger dog delivery, wedding kick-off welcome drinks, day-of setup all the way through the ceremony and all the way through the end of our reception, Katie was not just 5/5 she was 11/10. She's not only the kindest and most sincere but she's incredibly talented and detail oriented. Single-handedly, she made our experience at Silverado and we are endlessly thankful. Silverado resort lent itself to being the greatest combination of a beautiful venue with a decently priced room block for our guests and an all-on-property weekend including activities for guests and a late-night open bar. The 24/7 shuttle throughout the property was a perfect ride home for our guests to enjoy celebrating with us. Silverado was able to organize and accommodate everything from welcome bags to vendor pick ups. We had guests rave about their weekend and our wedding, including the outstanding appetizers at cocktail hour and food at our reception. Our photos, especially at sunset are so beautiful with the greenery and mansion as our backdrop. You truly can't go wrong by choosing Silverado for your wedding or event and I would recommend (to no end) requesting Katie as your Event Service Manager!

Silverado helped us plan and execute our dream wedding. Amber was a dream to work with and we are so thankful for her support, guidance, and kindness throughout the whole process....

We had some rather odd requests and she was always accommodating and helpful. We loved that all our guests could stay at the resort (the suites got rave reviews) and it truly made for an extraordinary weekend. We are so thrilled that we chose Silverado for our big day!

My wife Lauren and I got married at Silverado in May of 2019. For a year we had been planning on getting married out in The Grove (beautiful outdoor space amongst the golf course)....

In the true nature of weddings, we had an unexpected change of weather and it ended up raining on the day of our event. The staff was incredibly flexible and worked tirelessly to help make our day perfect regardless. They not only helped move the ceremony into a tented space, but were able to move cocktail hour to the Fairway Deck, and the reception into the ballroom. We both had the most amazing time and would recommend Silverado to anyone looking for an incredible wedding experience. From the start of our venue deciding process, we knew we wanted a place where our guests could stay and be together on site. Silverado was able to provide room blocks to all of our guests looking to stay there. It made the weekend so fun to have all of our friends and family be with us throughout the three days. They have an incredible staff as well as a free shuttle service to take you anywhere on property. From the venue tour to the food tasting, everything about Silverado is first class. Whether you are looking for a small vineyard or a ballroom party, Silverado has it all!

We had our wedding on 9/8/18 at the Grove and the setting could not have been more beautiful- our guests are still talking about it! It was more money than the other ceremony sites...

but absolutely worth it. As far as the staff and the food went- everyone was very polite, professional and accommodating, and the food was great. However, leading up to the day there was some last minute planning that was definitely a bit stressful so the communication in general could have been better. When we originally booked our venue, the wedding manager was Lorraine. Lorraine then left shortly after and we were left meeting with Kelly (head of catering) who ran our tasting. Turns out Kelly was not going to be there for our wedding, we were then left planning with Mary-Beth. Mary-Beth did a great job getting everything done. She was professional, fun, and very personable. We met with her the day before still going over the plans for the wedding the next day, so it was somewhat chaotic. I'm a big planner and really our final details with Silverado were not worked out until the few days prior to the day. Also, there were some issues with our room block we were trying to sort out and the head of reservations, Mayra, was never really prompt in returning our calls/emails. For the day of, my biggest worry was making sure our wedding party and guests had enough shuttles (vans and golf carts) getting to and from taking pictures and to and from the ceremony. Silverado is very spaced out and my fiance was getting ready almost 2 miles away from the ceremony site (which they knew our rooms ahead of time). Needless to say there were a couple times we were waiting for transportation. For example, with the wedding start time at 4pm our golf cart picked us up at about 4:02pm. It didn't end being a big deal but it was a stress I didn't want to have to worry about. Another thing was figuring out our final bill- which again didn't end up being an issue, I just wished I would have seen a final estimate beforehand. We were sorting out payments in the the couple weeks following it. However, Mary-Beth was always very reasonable and she made sure the brides and their families were given a great experience. We had an after glow following the wedding as well as a farewell brunch and the staff made sure both events were organized and decorated to the T. The head server ( I wish I could remember his name) was in charge of organizing both events and he did amazing!! He even threw in complimentary mimosas at the brunch. Some people thought it looked like another wedding reception. Overall it was an amazing day and you couldn't beat the location in Napa surrounded by oak trees. We would have the wedding there again if we could!

lverado Resort is a beautiful venue with an active golf course that was also very convenient for us and our guests as it accommodated our stay for the weekend and wedding event. The staff here are very friendly and genuinely love to help to make your experience enjoyable. We were blessed to have worked with Mary Beth G. from their wedding services the last month prior to our wedding event. In the last few weeks we were connected, she helped execute our vision for the day and communicated every detail to each department to help make the flow and process seamless. She did more for us than our day of event coordinators and she has a genuine kind heart. After our wedding, we had issues with over payment, but Mary Beth helped to make sure this was resolved. She has years of experience in wedding coordination and works with remarkable diligence. Overall, Silverado Resort is an amazing venue for any wedding or event.

First and foremost we had a wonderful wedding in a beautiful setting. Many of the individuals we dealt with at Silverado were sweet and very helpful. That said, Silverado was extre...

mely difficult to deal with, they nickel and dimed us at every opportunity, and customer service could not have been less important to them. Pros: 1) Truly spectacular setting – especially the grove and the fairway deck. 2) A great place for your guests to enjoy Napa as well as the resort itself 3) Jasmine the wedding coordinator was wonderful and made it a great day. She was very responsive throughout. We didn't have a coordinator but she made sure the whole set up was just as we planned. 4) They originally misquoted a lower price for the grove, but were good to their word and kept the original lower price. 5) They were willing to accommodate custom selections for the day after brunch. Cons: 1) They served the wrong food at our wedding. During the tasting the fish dish was bland and bad and we when back up for a second tasting (which we were charged $84 for) to try alternative dishes. We found a fish preparation we liked and agreed upon it. At the wedding the original (bad) fish was served. 2) They required a 3 night minimum for the wedding on a long weekend, fair enough, but only gave us 2 nights accommodation, so we not only had a to buy an extra night on our wedding weekend, but couldn’t even do it within the room block 3) In the middle of negotiating the room block – over one year out, before the rooms were even released – they increased prices nearly 40%. We had to plead with them to get the difference split. 4) Many things we were told throughout the process turned out to be incorrect or only partially true. For example initially we were told golf would be halted during our wedding (to avoid our guests getting hurt). The wedding weekend we were surprised to discover the tees would just be moved up. On the actual day the tees were not moved until the wedding had started and our entire family was frantically blocking golfers from hitting into the wedding. 5) We called John Evans (General Manager) to discuss the difficulties we were having with Silverado, and although it felt like a productive conversation and he agreed to call the next day with more information, he never called back and our repeated calls were never returned. 6) The welcome bags were sporadically delivered with some guests getting many while others got none. Bottom line: once you sign on the dotted line at Silverado they care little about you. However, it's a beautiful venue and everything turned out ok (excepting the food mess up). We’d do it again, but would negotiate far more aggressively before signing anything.

I should have paid more attention to the dates on all of the positive reviews - they are out of date. Silverado is a beautiful place and our wedding was very enjoyable. Luckily, we...

're not the type to get distraught over things not happening as planned. We found our coordinator to lack any sense of urgency in replying to our questions until the event was less than one month away. She was virtually impossible to get in touch with on the phone and replies to emails were delayed, incomplete or both. When completing forms that were sent to us by the event staff, the amendments requested were not carried through. Two days before the event, the coordinator met with us and had a version of the document that was 3 versions out of date. Even once the items were agreed, some were still completely overlooked when it came to setup and delivery on the wedding day. Our ceremony was not set up properly, our food was not what was ordered (I've never had fish so overcooked in any restaurant!) and no mention was made to us of meal substitutes where they were made. Overall, we had a great wedding because we were surrounded by people we cherish (and all other resort staff were lovely), but I could not in good conscious recommend anyone else to go through the same planning process we endured. Such a shame because it's such a lovely venue.

The moment we stepped into the grove at Silverado, we knew we'd found the perfect outdoor space — we were married beneath the arch of two tall, towering oak trees and we held our r...

eception in the resort's official grove site. From that first visit through our post-wedding brunch, the staff went above and beyond to make sure that we (and our 175 guests) had the most incredible wedding weekend. We were blown away how kind and accommodating everyone was — the bellmen, the catering staff, and most of all Aminah Mitchell, the main coordinator. She went out of her way to make sure that every last detail was taken care of and thanks to her, I was 100% hands-off and stress-free throughout the entire week of the wedding. What a blessing! All of our guests said it was the best wedding they'd ever been to — "like something out of a movie" is the phrase we heard most. So much of that stemmed from 1. the gorgeous venue 2. the quick, professional staff and 3. Aminah's hard work. I give Silverado the highest, most heartfelt recommendation!

We had 30+ rooms for the hotel block for our wedding. Silverado has great customer service. We had a few issues come up here and there and everybody was very accommodating. They ar...

e in the process of updating all of their rooms and our room was much nicer than I remembered when I stayed there in the past. I would recommend this place to other people looking for accommodations in Napa.

My hubby and I were married at Silverado Resort and Spa, in Napa on 8/21/10. It was such a great experience, and everything came out FANTABULOUS!!! If you want five star all the w...

ay, you need to check out Silverado. True, it's a little pricey, but in the end, it was ALL WORTH IT! First off, the entrance alone, makes for a grand impact on you and your guests. The resort is gorgeous, and the Grove is the perfect place for an outdoor wedding. Also, if you get the chance, check out their spa. It was pure heaven! The food was also a hit. We all know how wedding food can be, but my guests raved about their meal selections, especially the crabcakes and coconut shrimp. My guests were VERY impressed by Silverado's service. They're pretty well staffed and so accomodating. Not one request proved to be too large for them. They were truly amazing, and it really enhanced my guests' experience. Lastly, a BIG THANKS to Kimberlie Husted, the wedding coordinator for Silverado. Kimberlie was SO AWESOME!!! She's totally got all of her stuff together. She's organized, prompt and resourceful. She totally went out of her way to try and accomodate us and our guests. Silverado truly made me feel like a princess for my wedding weekend. Not only did they go above and beyond for my hubby and I, but for our family and guests as well. They were so impressed by this place, everybody can hardly wait for their next trip back!

I loved that it was set in the heart of the Napa Valley. The venue was where we had our ceremony, reception and lodging. We were provided with a variety of scenic locations for e...

ach special part of the day. The Fairway Deck for hors D'oevres, the Arbor for the ceremony, the Ballroom for the reception and in front of the main mansion was a great place for pictures. They're are endless beautiful backdrops for photos. And they also have a fantastic spa!;This is a great reception venue. The only thing I'd say is if you're planning on staying there, check out the rooms first. We had a nice one bedroom suite, but some people might be a little pickier about the amenities.

Truly gorgeous garden in the center of a golf course and surrounded by the beautiful mountainsin Napa Valley. The garden was lush with flowers and large trees. I crossed over a s...

mall bridge to enter the ceremony site and was amazed with the beauty of the Hupa nestled under the trees. The reception was nearby on a brick patio surrounded in flowers with Chinese Lanterns overhead and a small stage in the front which was perfect for our jazz band. Still had plenty of room for dining, dancing and socializing.;Bring jackets if you are out in the evening. Napa is known to get quite cool at night - it is the kind of weather that grapes love best!
