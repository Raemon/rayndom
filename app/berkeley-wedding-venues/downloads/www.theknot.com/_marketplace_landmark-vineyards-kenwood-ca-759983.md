ws, the whole wine country vibe we wanted. But what really made it amazing was the staff. They were SO on top of everything and genuinely just lovely people to work with. We didn't have to stress about a single thing the day of, which if you're planning a wedding you know is a miracle. If you're looking at Sonoma venues, definitely check out Landmark. We couldn't have asked for a better place to get married and I'm still thinking about how smooth everything went. 100% recommend!

cess and on the wedding day. The setting could not have been more beautiful, between the vines, mountains, fountain, and courtyard. One other benefit is how secluded the venue feels without being too out of the way - easy access to Sonoma/Santa Rosa for guests' stays, but the way that the venue is designed means you don't notice or hear the main road that is nearby. They can also turn off the fountain at points throughout the night, which was great for my family who are hard of hearing.

If you are planning to get married anywhere on Earth, I recommend that you choose Landmark's Kenwood Estate. Prior to getting married, my wife and I had visited a substantial numbe...

r of vineyards in wine country, and none of them compared to the beauty of Landmark's property: a landscape bursting with color that is magically framed against the backdrop of the Mayacamas Mountains. Plus, the lighting at sunset produces some of the most enchanting wedding photos ever. The setting is nothing compared to the service. There is not enough red carpet in the world to match the hospitality offered by Olivia Laney and every member of Landmark's staff. From the moment we decided to book our wedding at Landmark, Olivia was a constant partner, placing us with capable vendors like Maria with M Designs for flowers and making sure we had everything we needed in the way of accommodations, beverages, and settings, including hosting us for impromptu tastings throughout our time there. They even helped me avert disaster when I realized there was a stain on my dress shirt the morning of the wedding, and the staff took care of it immediately, restoring it to brand new, bright white condition. Landmark also provides remarkable accommodations on property. My wife and I stayed in the bridal suite for three nights, where we enjoyed a remarkable view of the mountains from the double doors leading to the patio, a gas fireplace with sitting area off the foot of our cozy bed, and a luxuriant ensuite bathroom. My wife's mother and stepfather stayed in the cottage on property, a short walk or drive away, which has a full kitchen, living area, bedroom, and bathroom. On the day of the wedding, after a morning hike at nearby Jack London State Park, the guys and I took in the view of the property from the tower above the tasting room while taking in some of Landmark's renowned Pinot Noir. In short, everything at and about Landmark led to us having the most beautiful wedding ever. We and our family and friends continue to remark with pure amazement about the special time we shared on your property. Thank you Olivia and Landmark for everything.

ght. We had three key requirements: the venue needed to be stunning, we wanted to connect with the venue manager, and, of course, the wine had to be amazing. Landmark exceeded our expectations on all counts. From the moment we arrived to tour the property and sample the wine, Olivia Laney, the venue manager, made us feel right at home. She was incredibly kind, welcoming, and genuine, and we instantly knew this was our place. I want to emphasize just how essential Olivia was throughout the entire planning process. She was hands-on, always available to answer our questions, and worked seamlessly with our coordinator, caterer, and other vendors. While Landmark is undeniably beautiful, it was the incredible Landmark staff that truly made our experience exceptional.

The beautiful flowers and outdoor furniture also helped us save a bit on other parts of our budget -- the space is so nice that it doesn't need too much done to it. We also liked the cottage and suite onsite, which are a nice perk. Landmark is definitely worth visiting if you are looking for a fantastic wine country venue!

ush and went perfectly with the big dinner party vibe that we wanted. Landmark also has a lot of furniture (e.g. white chairs, barrel bars) that we used for the ceremony and reception. We were able to have almost everything outdoors and then moved inside for dancing. We used the cottage for getting ready and stayed at the bridal suite the night of the wedding - both locations were perfect and it was so convenient! We were also able to hang some lanterns ourselves the morning of the wedding which really added to the ambiance. Highly recommend choosing Landmark!

They also set the tables up, had the tablecloths and chairs and a bar tender. The bar was very cute and classy. The setting is just beautiful with cement walkways (where we had the table), tall trees, a fountain, a pond, grass, and the vineyard etc. The staff was so nice - everyone I talked with was very helpful. There is also plenty of parking. It was the perfect spot for the dinner.

Olivia, in particular, went above and beyond to ensure that every detail was meticulously taken care of. Her expertise and experience shone through from our initial discussions all the way to the flawless execution of the event. The venue itself was absolutely breathtaking. The majestic Sugar Loaf Mountains served as a picturesque backdrop for our ceremony and reception. Our guests were captivated by the beauty and charm of the venue, and we received countless compliments on our choice of location. Not to mention, the wine was absolutely delicious! I can't express enough how much I recommend Landmark Vineyards. I look forward to returning to celebrate anniversaries and other special occasions in the future.

happy but after getting off the phone with Olivia we were thrilled. Not only is the venue GORGEOUS but the coordinator Olivia is amazing. She was the biggest help leading up to the wedding but was a literal angel the day of. She made sure the entire thing was running smoothly and that everything was executed to my vision. The wedding was very small and intimate (13 people) and everyone loved her. Honestly without her I don’t think I could have pulled off the whole thing so last minute. But in terms of the venue the place is amazing. My family was in awe the entire time and our photos are insane. I will say it’s a little bit out of the way of accommodations but it’s so worth it. The wine is amazing and all the preferred vendors we worked with were lovely. I am so so happy we went with landmark!!

e walked in we were greeted with genuine hospitality and has continued with every visit, phone chat and email. This wonderful winery with and amazing staff is an absolute gem. We fell in love the first time we visited and became wine club members. A year later, we were engaged and Landmark was on the top of our list for wedding venues. After a visit with Abigail and chatting with Olivia we were hooked. The process was simple and seamless. Olivia is incredibly responsive with any big or little questions or concerns. The walkthrough with our caterer was very thorough and upon leaving I felt comfortable with how our day would go. Being able to have the cottage the night before the event was perfect for getting ready the morning of the wedding and the event staff did a wonderful job with our setup. Our day was spectacular and we could not have asked for a better venue, day, weather or staff. The only thing I would keep in mind depending on time of year would be the lighting in the courtyard. The courtyard became darker than expected during dinner as we were running a little behind schedule due to our own timing. Oliva came to the rescue and put extra candles on the tables to make sure our guests were not “dining in the dark”. If we were to have a celebration again I would definitely pay for some extra lighting. We finished the night off dancing the night away in the tasting room! It truly was a night we will never forget and are incredibly grateful for Landmark Vineyards, Olivia, and the rest of their amazing staff. Mia & Ash

and gardens all year round and honestly didn't end up needing hardly any flowers to give a garden vibe to our event. Olivia is a marvel -- always responsive, in a perpetually sunny mood, super efficient and accommodating. We were able, for example, to get a tent up at the last min to tent our weekend, and also build a full kitchen for our chefs with fencing and privacy walls, and bring in a food truck for our friday night. The bridal guestroom and the cottage on site make it SO easy to stay on site and also be able to trim down on running around for yourself. It really feels like you're hosting at YOUR vineyard. Loved it -- so easy and relaxed and family-feeling.

abosolutely beautfiul outdoor space, complete with a view of the mountain, wildflowers, a small lake with trees, vineyards of course, bocce ball, lawn and lawn games, and two gorgeous oak trees covered in twinkle lights. Donna is fantastic and the rest of the tasting room staff was totally friendly every time we came in. They also let us store stuff and were wondeful to other vendors. We decided to do ItsIts ice cream sandwiches for dessert, and they even let us store them in their staff freezer a few days beforehand. The two rooms that come with the reception price were also fantastic. It's nice to have a place to store stuff and get ready, and really amazing to wake up the day of and the day after your wedding to a breath-taking view. It's also pretty cool to stay the night at winery, and sit on the lawn and have a glass of wine and re-live your wedding right after it has happened. My guests absolutely loved it. All I could say was that I can't believe the price was so reasonable for the area for all of the help and beauty we got.

it came to the week of, everyone was extremely accommodating as we were in and out needing places to store things, and I didn't have to worry at all about my vendors getting what they needed to set up ahead of time. We also appreciated the two rooms that came with our booking. We ended up staying in one, and used the cottage as a getting-ready area for the girls the day of. There was plenty of space for the six of us as we got ready. The wine, of course, is also wonderful. We ended up joining the wine club (which also got us a discount on the wine for the reception - I highly recommend it), and the tasting room workers were great whenever we popped in needing one thing or another. And the night of was absolutely beautiful. We barely decorated, only adding some hand-made centerpieces to our tables and lights on the dance floor, and we got so many compliments. It's just a naturally beautiful location.

We just had our wedding at Landmark and it was absolutely amazing. It was beyond our imagination. The grounds are stunning and Donna with Landmark is wonderful to work with. All...

of our guests were blown away by the place. We also loved being able to stay on property for our wedding night. I highly recommend Landmark, plus their wine is delicious!!
