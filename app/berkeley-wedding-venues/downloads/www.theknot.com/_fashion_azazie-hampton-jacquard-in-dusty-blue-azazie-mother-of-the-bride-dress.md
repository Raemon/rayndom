Description

Striking and elegant, the Hampton dress is a floor-length mermaid gown crafted from floral jacquard, designed with the mother of the bride in mind. Featuring a one-shoulder neckline with a fold-over detail and optional spaghetti strap for added support, it’s finished with a dramatic bow at the hip, flattering pleats through the waist, and a leg slit for a modern touch.
