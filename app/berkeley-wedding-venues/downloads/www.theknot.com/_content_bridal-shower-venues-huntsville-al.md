Alabama is teeming with charming wedding and bridal shower venues. You'll find many in or near Huntsville, the state's most populous city. What's more, when it comes to scouting bridal shower venues in Huntsville, AL, and its surrounding cities and towns, options abound—from gorgeous gardens and historic mansions to industrial-chic warehouses and lofts—to suit any aesthetic. It's also worth noting that Huntsville has its own international airport and is less than 150 miles from major cities like Birmingham, Nashville and Atlanta, meaning it's especially convenient for out-of-town guests.

As you scroll through—and ultimately narrow down—the top event venues in Huntsville, AL, it's important to consider the climate. Moreover, the state is known for its hot, humid weather—especially in the warmer months. Additionally, the state can experience inclement weather, like thunderstorms and tornadoes, in the spring and early summer. So, while an outdoor celebration may sound nice in theory, you'll probably want to avoid having an alfresco bridal shower unless it's in the fall or winter. However, the former tends to be more popular since the weather is more pleasant.
