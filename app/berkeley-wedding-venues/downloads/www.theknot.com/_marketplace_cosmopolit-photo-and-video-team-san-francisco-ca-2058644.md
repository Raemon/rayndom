We had the absolute pleasure of working with Valentina and the Cosmopolit Photo & Video team for our engagement shoot, and we cannot recommend them highly enough! Despite the rain...

and less-than-ideal weather on the day of our shoot, the photos and video turned out beyond beautiful — truly capturing the emotion and joy of the moment in a way that exceeded all our expectations. The fact that they were able to create such stunning work under those conditions speaks volumes about their talent, creativity, and professionalism. From the very start, Valentina and her team were thoughtful, detailed, and incredibly kind. They didn’t just show up to capture moments — they genuinely cared about making the entire experience special for us. Their attention to detail, from lighting to angles to timing, was impeccable. And beyond the technical excellence, they were selfless and helpful, going above and beyond to make sure we felt comfortable, confident, and present in the moment. The final product — both video and photos — are something we will cherish forever. If you’re looking for a team that blends artistry with heart, professionalism with warmth, and quality with care, look no further than Valentina and Cosmopolit.

Valentina is a skilled and accommodating photographer. She met with us first to discuss our vision and expectations before signing the contract and later a month or two before our...

wedding date to go over our preferences more in detail. On the day of the wedding she took a lot of pictures of the two of us posing before the wedding as well as a lit of pictures of family and friends as we requested. We were very happy with the style and the color scheme of the photos for our winter reception. The photos reflect the cozy and darker vibe we were going for. We also have a ton of pictures to share with guests both candids and group photos.

What is the key for stunning wedding photos? Photographer's skills! And it manifests itself not only in the ability to “hold a camera in your hands” but also, and no less important...

, in the ability to work with people, to be a psychologist. You have both of these essential skills! We even enjoyed the process of posing because our photographer managed to create an absolutely relaxed atmosphere: we joked, fooled around and kissed - we were ourselves, and as a result, we got a beautiful and candid photos. P.S: And after the event, it was easy to contact you, you promptly answered questions and fulfilled all our requests. Highly recommend!

ice. From the jump, Valentina made it super easy to coordinate with. You can just tell by her level of professionalism that you were working with a real PRO! I already fell in love with her portfolio (that's a given) and she made it so easy to help me come up with the visual concept and the run down of what would work for my wedding and theme. Since most of us are planning from scratch and zero experience, I was anxious to finding the best photographer & videographer. But when you work with someone of this level of expertise, all of the worrying just goes out the window. Also, if you are hesitating to decide whether to include video for your wedding, just DO IT.! The video came out exceptional, literally looks like a movie trailer. My husband and I cried because we could re-live the wedding over and over whenever we want. I can't express how much I highly recommend the team. They are worth every cent! Thank you again to Cosmopolit Team!

Working with Valentina for our wedding ceremony was absolutely wonderful. From the beginning, she made it easy for us to give input on the direction we wanted to go with our photos...

in our consultation sessions and our text group. Ultimately, we relied on her vast experience to capture the beauty of our day. And we are so glad we did! Our wedding photos not only were beautiful but also playful, loving and full of joy. She went above and beyond to capture the beauty of our love, and for that we will forever be grateful!

h them. They were: \- Flexible and understanding to changes and crazy wedding schedules \- Well equipped!!! \- Super professional: we’re not in front of cameras often so it’s a bit awkward for us to do a grand photo/video shoot. But they gave us direction, pose ideas, and made us feel comfortable so that we could be in the moment to embrace the experience. \- Very skilled: in addition to taking the photos and videos, they are skilled editors! We loved our final edited photos and videos. Our videos were a lot longer than we expected. We were so glad that many of our footages weren’t cut just to meet time frame. Overall, they just knew what to do and that really helps ease the stress of wedding day. We appreciated how thoughtful and genuine they were. We would definitely book them again for other occasions :) <3

Dear John and Valentina, This message is long overdue, and for that we deeply apologize. We want to thank you both for taking such stunning photos of us, our ceremonies, our venue,...

and every moment in between. Your vibrant photos captured the immense love in the air we felt that day--from one another and from our families. These we will surely look back on for years to come with a big smile on our faces. It was an absolute pleasure working with you both, and neither of us could think of two better people suited to share our special day with.
