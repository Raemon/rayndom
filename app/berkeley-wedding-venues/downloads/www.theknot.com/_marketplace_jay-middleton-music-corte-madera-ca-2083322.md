d perfectly matched to the energy we envisioned for the day. The band didn’t just show up and play, but rather they took the time to really get to know us, our guests, and the kind of atmosphere we wanted to create. Leading up to the wedding, they worked closely with us to curate a thoughtful, dynamic playlist that balanced our favorite songs with crowd-pleasing hits. They offered great suggestions, helped us fine-tune the setlist, and coordinated every detail with our wedding planner. Their attention to detail and responsiveness made the entire planning process stress-free and enjoyable. On the big day, they absolutely exceeded our expectations. Every transition felt effortless, and the energy they brought to the room was electric. They knew exactly how to read the crowd — keeping the dance floor full, smiles wide, and spirits high from start to finish. Our guests couldn’t stop raving about how talented the musicians were and how much fun they had dancing to every set. Beyond their talent, what really stood out was their professionalism and warmth. They arrived early, were well-prepared, and collaborated seamlessly with our planner and venue team to make sure everything ran smoothly. Their passion for what they do was evident in every note they played, and it added something truly special to our celebration. If you’re looking for musicians who will not only deliver an amazing performance but also be a joy to work with, this is the group you want by your side. We’re so grateful to them for helping us create memories that we and our guests will cherish forever. Jay - we can honestly say the band helped make our wedding truly unforgettable.

Jay Middleton Party Band was our wedding entertainment on June 29th 2025 and working with them was a dream come true. I knew I wanted to band to be the main attraction, and boy was...

it. So many guests minds were blown but having a live band, and Jay Middleton just made it even more amazing. Before our wedding, Jay and I talked numerous times about details, vision, and song choices. He was well organized, positive, professional, and fun to work with. And the band members were all a great time! On the wedding day, Jay was our MC and helped run the reception smoothly and kept everything on time. Jay was amazing! If I ever need another band, I’ll be coming right back to them. If you hire Jay Middleton Party Band, you won't be disappointed.
