My bridal consultant was Grace. I felt she was genuinely honest and after getting to know me and what I was looking for in a dress and even my budget, she grabbed a few and EVERY d...

ress she chose was beautiful!! She made the experience for me and a couple of my bridesmaids smooth and nice. I thought it was pretty cool that they ask for your favorite artists or music - Grace played Sabrina Carpenter and any other artist similar - made me feel great hehe. Grace let me even see how a couple of dresses I was deciding on looked at their mirror in front of the store. The lighting was nice. After finding "the dress" they give you champagne to take home. It was a great experience and I got to glance at the other dresses there and they were all so beautiful. I love that they have so many options. And note that the dresses in this store are consignments and samples. Definitely recommend this place if you are looking for your special dress!

coming, warm, and amazing! I especially love the way they handle and keep all of the dresses with professionalism and great care. Each dress is kept in separate bag and with very clear labeling. Because of that, all of the dresses I tried on were like brand new and the whole process was smooth and seamless. Although I didn't find my dress, I had a great experience! This also helps me feel really good about leaving my brand new dress with them. Highly recommend!

ht sizes and styles that were within my budget. She also helped with choosing accessories. We had a great time taking photos and videos together to capture the moment. We didn't feel rushed at all. The store is well-decorated so the shots were beautiful. I was so pleased to walk away with my dream dress and veil and come out under budget. I would definitely recommend this place as a first stop for wedding dress shopping.
