Registering for your wedding is one of the most exciting things you'll do together as a to-be-wed couple. If you're looking for big-ticket items or unique home decor, consider a Home Depot wedding registry. With more and more couples cohabitating before marriage, it may be one of the [best places to register for a wedding](https://www.theknot.com/content/complete-registry-store-guide) to help you complete home improvement projects or lawn maintenance and afford large appliances.

Many couples are opting to create their registries online since doing so gives you a lot more flexibility to combine items from different stores in one convenient location. [The Knot Registry Store](https://www.theknot.com/registry) is a universal registry that allows you to link your wedding website with registries from any online store. In this article, we'll fill you in on how to create a Home Depot wedding registry using The Knot or another form of universal wedding registry and what you need for your home.

## Does Home Depot Have a Wedding Registry?

You can't create an actual wedding registry on the Home Depot website, nor can you register for wedding gifts at a Home Depot store using one of those nifty handheld scanners. However, you can create a wishlist on the Home Depot website that can be linked to a [universal wedding registry](https://www.theknot.com/content/the-knot-universal-registry), such as The Knot Registry Store. 

While it may seem inconvenient that you can't make a Home Depot wedding registry, the beauty of a universal registry is that you can select pretty much any item you can think of, including [gift cards](https://www.theknot.com/content/gift-cards-wedding-registry) and money (think: [adding a registry house fund](https://www.theknot.com/content/house-fund-wedding-registry)!), and include it in your registry. It's a convenient, one-stop-shopping situation for your guests, and it prevents you from having to register at several different stores (and share that information with guests, who may find it confusing and overwhelming). 

## How to Make a Home Depot Wedding Registry to Link on The Knot

Let's get started! Here's how to create a list that will serve as your Home Depot online wedding registry and link it to your universal registry on The Knot. First, follow these detailed steps to create a list on the Home Depot website and add your desired items. 

  1. **Create an account** on the [Home Depot ](https://www.homedepot.com/auth/view/signin?redirect=/&ref=)website. 
  2. Once you've created an account, **click on Me** on the upper right-hand side of the page. 
  3. Go to **Product Lists** and click **Create New List**.
  4. **Name** your list and click **Create List**. 
  5. Click **Start Shopping** in order to select products to add to your list. 
  6. Once you find an item you'd like to add to your list, **click the heart icon** to add it to your list. 
  7. This will take you to a screen where you'll select the list you'd like to add the product to (you can create more than one list on your Home Depot account). 
  8. **Select your list** and click **Add to List**. 



Now that you've made a list of things you'd like to receive as gifts from Home Depot, it's time to link your list to The Knot Registry Store. 

  1. **Navigate to**[**this link**](https://www.theknot.com/registry/add-store-registries) to add stores to your registry on The Knot.
  2. Home Depot is not a partner store for The Knot, so **scroll down to Option Two: Link Your Store Registries**. 
  3. Under Select a Store, **scroll all the way down and click the plus sign**.
  4. Click **Add Another Store**.
  5. **Enter Home Depot**.
  6. **Add your registry link** to the space that requests your URL. 
  7. Alternatively, you can **scroll to Option Three: Add Gifts From Anywhere**. 
  8. Here, you can **add the pink "Add to The Knot" button to your browser's bookmark tab** to easily add items to your universal registry on The Knot.
