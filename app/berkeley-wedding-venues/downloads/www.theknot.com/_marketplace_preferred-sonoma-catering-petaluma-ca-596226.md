d just absolutely lovely humans all around (and very patient with me and my difficulties with decision making- haha). Everyone we encountered at Preferred Sonoma was kind, helpful, and genuine. They treat you like family. Cheryl and the other staff at our wedding were beyond phenomenal! Service was spot-on, as was the presentation of the dishes and the dinnerware! If the staff alone were not enough, their food is DELICIOUS!!! We ended up going with their TriTip and Mary's Chicken for dinner, but couldn't have gone wrong as everything we tried was fantastic at our tastings. They have so many options for any budget or type of event! Many of our guests said it was the best chicken they have ever had- and I have to agree. My husband, parents, and I feel very lucky to have worked with Sonoma caterers, and will definitely use Preferred Sonoma in the future!

asize what an absolute pleasure the PSC team was to work with, especially AnnieLaurie and Tori Keck. They always made me feel heard and so taken care of. Not only was the service excellent, but our food was outstanding. I was blown away by it at our tasting, and just as thrilled with our meal on the big day. Plus, PSC handled all of our rentals and made our vision come to life - I could write pages about how wonderful they are, you're really doing yourself a favor by hiring them!

Preferred Sonoma Caterers made our dream wedding day come true. We were initially meant to have our wedding may 2020 and it was postponed due to the pandemic. They willingly and se...

amlessly worked with us (at no additional cost) and they made our dream a reality. They were creative, detail oriented, organized, professional, collaborative, good communicators, responsive, reliable, and made our vision come true (highly recommend food stations!). All the caterers also came up to bride/groom throughout the night to share how much they liked my dress and how they loved the ceremony. It was beautiful to hear from them. So many of our friends and family shared after the wedding, "that food was incredible". They were all impressed with the different options, flavors, and uniqueness of the menus. Preferred Sonoma Caterers are the best of the best. We can 't thank them enough for making our dream a reality. We highly recommend them!

ur guests, some tables even ordered seconds—it was that good! It was definitely the best catering I’ve ever had! Wedding food can be easy to get wrong, but they absolutely NAILED IT. It wasn’t only the amazing food that we loved about them, but the staff at PSC are the **most** fantastic group of people. Chef Amber is truly a sweetheart (she even pulled a safety pin off her jacket when I mentioned my gown needed one! .. it’s the little things) and she is such a talented chef. Karen was the lead event planner for years at PSC, she ended up leaving before our wedding but assured us she would still keep in contact through the wedding. How awesome is that?! She worked with us through all of our planning and all of my million questions. They even did all of the coordinating for our rentals which is a huge task that was just an amazing perk that made wedding planning easier on us. AnnieLaurie took over for Karen when she left and was our contact towards the end, she is a gem. She treated us like royalty all night! All of the staff did. We got compliments from our guests on how great they were. That was wonderful. I am so thankful we chose PSC. Our wedding wouldn’t have been the same without them.

tasting after going through the menu with us, and we were blown away. The food was absolutely delicious and it was the easiest decision we had to make. Karen was so sweet, communicative and accommodating through the entire process and always put as at ease, whenever we were feeling stressed! She helped us with catering, bartending and rentals and made the whole process easy and streamlined, while being mindful of our budget. Our wedding day was absolutely perfect thanks to preferred Sonoma caterers..Our guests loved the speciality drinks, the service and food!

ne). They are the best of the best!! We worked with Karen for the majority of the time - she is absolutely amazing! I felt like we had a full service wedding planner, caterer, advice giver, all in one. And the best part, their food is AMAZING. We had so many guests tell us that it was the best food they have ever had at a wedding. My husband and I feel the same way!! We are still drooling over the dinner - braised short ribs & Mary's chicken breast. Presentation was perfect, the food was delicious, the staff is a dream, I could go on and on. We even got lucky and they packed us up a few boxes of dinners for us to eat after our wedding. We loved having this the day after :) I'd love to hire them again and will always remember our experience with this team! Throughout all the craziness of the past few years, PSC was so kind, helpful, flexible, and willing to help. Thank you, Preferred Sonoma Caterers for making our wedding day so perfect!!

tely sold on Preferred Sonoma after our tasting with Amber. Amber is amazing and so knowledgeable about food and weddings. We loved how she worked with us to craft our menu, asking us things like, "what's your favorite vegetable, what's your favorite dessert", etc. We met when we were both living in Philadelphia, so we had philly cheesesteaks as one of our late night snacks which was amazing! And our favorite dessert is ice cream cookie sandwiches, which Amber made happen. People were raving about all of the food at our wedding. We had a plated dinner for 115 people. We had beef short rib and salmon, with family style sides: roasted butternut squash, brussels, and cauliflower au gratin. Everything was amazing and perfectly cooked. Preferred Sonoma also facilitated the rentals for us which was fantastic. Thank you Amber!!

We got married in Santa Rosa in a redwoods grove in July and had over a year to plan so have been working with Preferred Sonoma catering for a while. The venue is bare bones so if...

you need a catering company to come in with full service and deliver on fantastic local food and service for a reasonable price then this is your company . Edie won us over on the first meeting where she laid out the day and the food options based on their direct experience with our venue and all the while asking us questions on our preferences and our story which no other caterer did. We honestly can not think of any category that they can improve.. the guests raved about the food (and I do feel like the standards are high for NorCal) and they worked seamlessly with our other venues and the drinks never stopped flowing ! Can not recommend them enough

They really are pros! Thank you SO much to them and their awesome staff

iliar with the quirky setup of the venue. This team is the one to hire! We knew we were in good hands from the beginning; Edie was super helpful and very responsive, and Amber made the entire process easy, seamless, and fun. In fact, they were so fantastic that we asked them to caterer our brunch on the bluffs the following day. The FOOD! Our friends and family are still talking about how amazing the food was at the wedding. I work in hospitality and know how difficult it is to run a banquet event and to maintain the food quality. We had two passed apps, the bounty cheese & fruit display and added charcuterie; two types of salads family style, and a full buffet with chicken, braised beef, farro, veggies, and ravioli (these were mouth-watering). For dessert, we had their classy cups and s'mores, and asked that they assist to set up our cookie table (hometown tradition). Not only did everything look great, but it tasted even better. We've already had a couple of friends reach out for recommendations! A huge THANK YOU to this entire team - you've exceeded our expectations. If we can give a better rating, we would. We highly recommend PSC, and suggest that you contact them if planning an event in or around the Sonoma/Petaluma/Bodega Bay area. They will be the first ones we call should we host an event that way again.

cess. Amber and Edie are so experienced and were always there to answer questions, help us with logistics, recommend other vendors they've worked with for other things, the list goes on. In addition to how great they were throughout the planning process, we still haven't stopped hearing from guests that our food was the best ever, our bartenders were so fun and nice, the service was perfect, etc. etc. Thank you Amber and Edie! You made our day! and my family is still talking about the lamb chops ;)

I loved our wedding day so much but I have to say...Preferred Sonoma Caterers was the best part! No matter how perfectly I could have planned our wedding, I simply could not have ...

done it without them! The minute we met Amber at her adorable storefront in Petaluma all of our worries and stresses about finding a caterer faded! We had an amazing tasting and fell in love with the incredible local food and Amber! She is such a calming yet spunky spirit- the exact person you want to help you with your wedding! I would say.. help with catering here, but to be honest PSC did so much more than catering! They did the rentals, the floor plan, the set up, the clean up, the dance floor, the incredible bar and food service! They even let us come in to the storefront so I could ponder on linens, silverware and napkins! Amber set a table for us and fed us cookies.... I mean, really?! So amazing! I really can't tell you how easy they made it! We had to bring everything into our venue down to the silverware and they took care of it all! The food was amazing! The cheese station they set up belongs in a catalog! We got so many compliments on everything! The dinner I had on my wedding night was the most amazing meal I have had and the best part, they boxed up all of the leftovers for us to enjoy the next day! Amazing! I wish they would open a restaraunt so I could have some of their tortellinis right now.. the best pasta sauce I have ever had :) I would also like to mention a very important part of this picture... EDIE! Edie is the office manager and she is superwoman! I think her and I exchanged about 100 e-mails with me changing the colors of the napkins, the floorpans... so many things and she literally made each and every change without hesitation, answered all of my questions, made sure we were aware of cost changes with our changes, and was SO on top of it the entire time! Knowing Edie was going to have an answer to my frantic 3am e-mails first thing in the morning saved me so much sleep!!! The face time with Amber was amazing and the work behind the scenes from Edie kept us all so organized! I am so thankful to have found this dynamic duo, I know this sounds weird in a review but these are the type of people you would trust your life with and brides who are planning their weddings, I know you can relate to that feeling! Your wedding is SOOO important and yes you want delicious food, but with Preferred Sonoma Caterers you get so much more than that! You get an amazing team that has your back every step of the way! I also have to mention that PSC were also SO affordable! It really amazes me that they offer such incredible services at such a great price! When we found them we literally felt like we found the pot of gold at the end of a rainbow! It is no wonder they have been doing this for over 20 years- they are the best in the business! Do yourself a favor and give Preferred Sonoma Caterers a call for your wedding or event! You really won't regret it! - Jessica married in Sebastopol CA on July 16 2016

Amber, Edie and their excellent day-of staff were out of this world. Preferred Sonoma Catering will cater any party I host in the future. Amber led us through each step of imagini...

ng our day and how food and drink would amplify the experience. She guided us through decisions about glassware and flatware effectively and efficiently. We were incredibly impressed with the final product. When we met with Amber at our event site for a walk through, she had worked with the location event staff before and they were very happy to be working with her again. She again reviewed each step of the day with both us and the event staff to ensure we were all on the same page. The day of was perfect. Everything was when and where it was supposed to be. Her staff managed our unique schedule and specialty sangria without any hiccup. I also appreciated that each of the staff went out of the way to ensure that we were taken care of at all times. Most importantly for us, the food was great. So many times weddings and large events lose good food because they prioritize appearances or timing—not PSC. Amber and her staff served excellent, delicious food at the right time, in a gorgeous setting. They got it all right.

I had a few guests with a gluten sensitivity and an allergy to red meat, and they figured out hors d’oeuvres, main course and desserts to accommodate everyone!
