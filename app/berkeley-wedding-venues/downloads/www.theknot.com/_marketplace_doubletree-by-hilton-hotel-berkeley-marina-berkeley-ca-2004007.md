This was our main hotel for our wedding and we had an excellent experience! We had our ceremony and reception at a different location in Berkeley, but all our guests stayed at the ...

Marina hotel and we had our rehearsal and a welcome breakfast at the hotel. The staff was warm and professional (valets, concierge, events, and cleaning staff) and the hotel was clean and nicely decorated. We had ample access to common spaces where our guests could hang out and socialize. Natasha Norman was my main contact at the hotel, and she was by far my favorite wedding vendor to work with! Always quick to respond and happy to help. :)

tire team at DoubleTree went above and beyond to ensure every detail was perfect for our special day. Their level of cooperation and collaboration was unparalleled. They worked tirelessly with us, listening attentively to our ideas and desires, and offering valuable insights to make our event truly unforgettable. No detail was too small for them to handle, and their dedication to excellence was evident in every aspect of the planning process. On the day of the event, we were blown away by the professionalism and warmth of the staff. From the event coordinators to the servers, everyone treated us and our guests with the utmost care and respect. They anticipated our needs before we even had to ask, ensuring that everything ran smoothly from start to finish. The venue itself was stunning, with breathtaking views of the Berkeley Marina that provided the perfect backdrop for our celebration. The atmosphere was elegant yet inviting, creating the ideal setting for our special day. We cannot thank the DoubleTree Hilton team enough for their outstanding service and hospitality. They truly exceeded our expectations in every way possible, and we feel incredibly grateful to have chosen them for our engagement ceremony. We wholeheartedly recommend DoubleTree Hilton, Berkeley Marina to anyone seeking a truly exceptional event experience

lexible in accommodating pretty much any request (kombucha and edible glitter for our special drinks and bounce houses in the ballroom for our reception, to name a few of our quirky ideas that were brought to life without a glitch). Her boss is always awesome and helped recover a hiccup along the way. We had to switch to a back-up plan for cocktail hour due to the weather forecast, which was handled seamlessly. The hotel itself is also beautiful - the guests enjoyed the gorgeous scenery and some fun hangouts at the pool. It was definitely a bonus to have the hotel rooms, ceremony, and reception on within steps of each other. Outside of catering and special events, I would say the staff was a bit hit or miss when it came to checking in or getting towels for the pool etc, but this was pretty minor and I would still give 5 stars. All around, the wedding was a success, the space was gorgeous, and Natasha was an absolute joy to work with! Definitely consider having your wedding here if you’re looking for somewhere beautiful with excellent service in the Bay Area.

sha was incredible and professional on every front -- simply fabulous to work with. For starters, I appreciated her attention to detail, her diligence, and her behind-the-scenes coordination. In aggregate, these traits highlighted her exemplary work ethic and broad expertise in the realm of Catering & Conference Services. Her conscientiousness was also very commendable, I might add. She was always available to present us with workable options and advise us on a variety of matters, as needed, which we very much appreciated. I was also impressed by Natasha’s ability to coordinate the work of her (DoubleTree Inn’s) staff with that of the various vendors we selected. All in all, the entire day’s activities were a tremendous success. In summary, Natasha can be a very valuable addition to one’s close circle in the realm of planning and coordinating such events. Very impressive, Natasha. Thank you for the wonderful job, and we wish you continued success in all your endeavors.” --- Ramesh & Patricia Ramchandani, Bride’s parents.

ctations well, was incredibly responsive, and helped coordinate the event on the day of the wedding. We asked for some extra time to set up the room and, since the room hadn't been booked the day before the event, she let us come in the day prior to get everything in order. Natasha spoke with our DJ and coordinated for his set-up, which was very helpful. The team setting up the event also did the perfect job of setting up the tables and outdoor chairs exactly as we'd asked. I changed my mind on the arch at the last minute, and they had no problem making the change. The wedding was incredible, our guests felt comfortable in their rooms and were pleased they could bring their dogs so they didn't have to hire a dog-sitter. Everyone was impressed by the view and by the fact that the sun was setting behind the sweetheart table in the Bayview Ballroom. I also want to give a shoutout to the banquet manager who made us feel at home, kindly brought us beverages as we were setting up, and took care of us throughout the stay. I’ve received at least half a dozen compliments on the qualify of the food served, and I felt the pricing was very reasonable – especially when compared to other hotels on the water nearby. I also loved that the hotel provided us a contingency plan if we needed to move our outdoor wedding to the indoors because of rain or anything else. We truly felt special and valued and would use this venue again in a heartbeat.

ing a wedding. We kept a realistic budget and Natasha helped us with that. We had early conversations on what was desired, she kept in touch, was very thorough and she followed up with us. It was a great experience working with Natasha and her staff. The day of the wedding she was there and ready to help with anything. We had 50+ rooms booked for our guests. Only 1 issue and it was quickly resolved in minutes. Thank you for helping to make our daughters dreams come true! I highly recommend this venue, no need to drive anywhere! You can do it all here! The location was an all in one and much more affordable in comparison to other properties that did not offer half of the services available at the DT.

The property itself is gorgeous and the rooms are comfortable; however, the booking and block management were disastrous. The booking link frequently didn't work and we were consta...

ntly emailing our support contact to fix things. Our guests were repeatedly told incorrect or conflicting information by hotel staff while booking, shown inflated room prices on booking pages, and even locked out of their rooms mid-stay due to an error in the block creation (even though we knew about the error in advance and management promised us they'd fixed it). We were also told we'd receive member points for the stay, but that never happened. It felt like disorganization and a lack of communication rather than dishonesty, as our support contact and the staff generously helped us out on a few other things, but overall not the kinds of headaches you want to deal with during your wedding.

Natasha Norman and the Berkeley Boathouse truly saved the day! My husband and I were originally supposed to be married in May 2020 (you obviously know how that went…or DIDN’T go mo...

re importantly!) We initially had a different venue for our rehearsal dinner for our ‘original’ wedding, and they had honestly been a bit difficult and unreliable to work with even pre-pandemic. We were very fortunate to see the writing on the wall in March 2020 and decided to push our wedding out to October 16th, 2021 and were able to retain our venue and all vendors. However, when our new date began inching closer, we found our initial rehearsal dinner venue was even more unreliable and non-communicative than pre-pandemic!! That venue eventually fell through completely and so I decided to reach out to the Berkeley Boathouse restaurant at The Doubletree by Hilton Berkeley Marina, as this hotel was where myself + groom, much of the wedding party, and many guests were already staying. Natasha (Director of Catering & Conference Services) responded quickly and offered a tour of the restaurant and introduction to options. My MIL and I toured and found the restaurant to be absolutely beautiful and Natasha did a wonderful job of working with us to feel comfortable with a budget proposal. We decided almost instantly after our meeting that this was the place! The night of, I was delighted to see Natasha there to greet us at the start of our event! She was warm, welcoming, and extremely professional throughout the entire planning process. Our night went absolutely perfectly- the bartender was friendly and wonderful with our guests, the DIY taco bar was a hit, and guests could not get enough of the unbelievable October sunset from the venue (it was so beautiful everyone went outside for pictures!) I could not have been happier with how the event turned out. In terms of the hotel itself, the rooms were comfortable and clean, staff friendly and helpful, and the hotel and the location are just beautiful! We had many waterfront morning coffee walks and enjoyed the gorgeous views. Side note, staying in the hotel for several days means I had several meals at the Boathouse, and the food and service were excellent!

3 days Oct 8-10, 2021 at Doubletree by Hilton Berkeley Marina. We also had 100+ guests staying at the hotel. All the indoor and outdoor venues and location is fantastic. Natasha is very organized, responsive, and professional. She is an absolute pleasure to work with and makes an excellent planning partner and stays on top of things to make the events go smooth. She even worked on Saturday, the day of our event. as per our request. Lalit Khanna, Natasha's manager, also was involved and helpful as and when needed. They both deserve 5+ stars!!! Thank you for everything. The hotel service staff can definitely improve on timely service and professionalism. All the feedback was provided to Natasha and Lalit. All in all, our children had their dream wedding come to reality by effective collaboration among bride-groom, parents, and Doubletree.

inner reception, and were able to utilize all the hotel's spaces. Natasha was extremely helpful, communicative, and responsive throughout the entire process, from when we initially met with her over a year before our wedding date. Importantly, even when there was something that seemed unworkable, she would always find an alternative or compromise to ensure we were able to carry out our wedding the way we wanted. She was also able to put us in touch with the relevant people at the hotel when she was unavailable such that we always had a contact when a question came up. The venue itself is beautiful and has several spaces including an outdoor waterfront patio, a small ballroom with the water view, and the main ballroom for large events. The hotel staff were all compliant with COVID-19 restrictions, and readily had hand sanitizer and face masks available. We would recommend working with Natasha and the DoubleTree Berkeley Marina for your event.

and it was brought to life on our big day. Everything came out the way we wanted and beyond. We had the privilege of working with Natasha Norman, who is fantastic. She is very friendly and accommodating. She understood the mission and went above and beyond to make our big day exciting and beautiful. From the day we decided to have our reception here, to the actual big day, everything was fantastic. Natasha was very helpful and made sure everything went well. Everything from planning, questions, changes, you name it, Natasha was with us every step of the way. Thank you so much Natasha for everything that you have done for us. We couldn't have done it without you! The venue is very well placed on the marina with great views. The staff is very accommodating, and helpful. The food was great, both at our rehearsal dinner and reception. Another plus side of having your wedding here is being able to stay at The Doubletree. The rooms are nice and spacious. We were able to get ready in our suites for our big day, and then stay the night after the reception. Very convenient! We were also able to get a room block for our guests, and we had a lot of our guest stay the night as well. It's nice to be able have that accommodation available. This venue and staff checked off everything that we were looking for, and we are happy that we went with The Doubletree. We highly recommend this venue!!

de the special day easy. From the room block to people changing their minds, Natasha Norman really accommodated our wants and needs before the wedding, during the wedding and even after. Her and the staff really made it happen and just made the vision a reality. We decided to have the rehearsal dinner here and it was nice to be able to go to your room after. We had to ask for extra meals because we had two guests we had to accommodate and Rose made it happen. I know with all the food they had to make it would’ve been added stress for the kitchen but she did it with ease! After dinner I needed to do some final touches on the decor the night before and the staff let me in the venue. Natasha was there the whole time at the rehearsal dinner and the day of the wedding to make sure everything went on without a hiccup. Thank you Natasha and team for making my sisters dream a reality. Everything was perfect! If you want a venue that will accommodate you and your vision, then you need to do it here!

I am so happy to have had DoubleTree Berkeley Marina host our Indian wedding celebrations and prewedding events. The staff at DoubleTree were readily available to assist us during ...

all of our events, and made sure we didn’t miss anything. They were organized, and helped our planner make decisions on little details involved with each ceremony to ensure everything would go as planned. Special shoutout to Natasha Norman for being so patient and so accommodating! She went the extra mile for us on so many occasions. She even accepted my hair floral deliveries and made sure they were refrigerated and kept fresh for our events! This is just one example of the amount of support we had for even the smallest things! With their help, our events were seamlessly executed, and our vision brought to life! The bay view ballroom was beautiful, airy, and a perfect place to have our sangeet and mendhi (prewedding celebration). The floor-to-ceiling windows, with the Marina view provided the perfect unique background to pair with our brightly coloured decor setup. The outdoor venue by the Marina was used for our wedding day, and was the perfect amount of open space for our ceremony and guests. The view was the perfect background for our ceremony stage setup and overall looked breathtaking. Not to mention we had the appropriate amount of privacy from nearby tourists and hotel guests. This was actually an issue for a lot of other outdoor hotel venues we had looked into before that were by the water, so I was very happy with our decision to have the wedding here! A lot of our guests were from out of state and out of country, and they felt right at home thanks to the amazing hospitality provided by DoubleTree. Our vendors and their setups were also well accommodated for each event, and the hotel helped ensure their work remained seamless and uninterrupted. I couldn’t imagine celebrating our special day anywhere else!

I was a Wedding Coordinator for a Wedding Reception that took place at the Doubletree by Hilton Berkeley Marina in September of 2021 and it was one of the most amazing Weddings tha...

t I have been a part of. Natasha, Director of Catering and Conference Services, was one of the best people I've worked with in the Wedding Industry. Not only did she take care of every want and need from the Bride and Groom, she responded to any questions/concerns that I had immediately. We felt very reassured leading to the Big Day. The Day Of the Bride and Groom's Wedding Day, Natasha and the Doubletree Staff were incredible. First of all the Wedding Reception Room was already 100% fully set-up by the time I got there, which was about 3 hours before the Reception Started. They even set-up all the decorative items that the Bride and Groom wanted up and as a Wedding Coordinator, this helps so much and allows me to work on other aspects of the Wedding. Secondly, the Doubletree Staff was there to support the Bride, Groom, Myself and all the attendees with all of their needs like needing additional chairs, tables, additional food orders, etc. Finally, the Wedding Reception went so smooth and the clean up after by the Doubletree Staff was very easy for all of us involved. As a Vendor, we also appreciated that we all had our parking validated. To also give quick tidbits to highly consider Doubletree by Hilton Berkeley Marina: -This hotel is in a prime location in the Bay Area, which is only about 15-20 minutes away from San Francisco -We had just under 100 guests that fit in their space comfortably. -Since the Bride and Groom had their Reception here, the Doubletree not only gave them a room block for their guests, but also gave them these hotel rooms at a discounted rate. -As someone who is a part of a lot of Weddings, it is very convenient to have your Reception at the same Hotel you and your guests will be staying at after the party is over, which makes it easier to drop off items in your rooms and makes it safe if some of your guests party a little too much. -Having the views of the San Francisco/Bay Area can also add to the epicness of your Wedding Pictures. I highly recommend the Doubletree by Hilton Berkeley Marina for your Wedding Day.

letree Hotel, knowing the location is beautiful on the water and hoping that by chance the Saturday date was available. Natasha Norman, Director of Catering and Conferences, took my call and, to both of our amazements, the Bayview room and the outdoor ceremony space was free! With calm and complete professionalism, sprinkled with humor and caring, she pulled together staff, and sent my contracts, conveyed all the details about food, decorations, lighting, timeline. By the end of the day, we had our head count and knew what each person was going to be served three days later. On Saturday night she was there while we were decorating, and she stayed throughout the ceremony and into the dinner, when she personally introduced me to her associate Rosalita who would then take over. Natasha even took of lovely photograph of the bride walking down the grassy aisle, which she later sent me. She was amazing! The venue was terrific. The ceremony took place on the grass facing the Berkeley marina with sail and fishing boats tinkling in the background; and further out, the skyline of San Francisco and the Golden Gate Bridge. A late afternoon wedding is a perfect time to later enjoy the sunset. Cocktails were enjoyed on the adjacent patio which had comfortable cushioned chairs next to low tables and a few high tops. Dinner and dancing were in the BayView room, a semi round room lined with windows facing the patio and marina. It has an exceptionally high, wood beamed ceiling centered with a large glass chandelier. We got to choose the color of the lights which were beamed up along the sides of the walls. The food was tasty! Altogether it was very festive. I have planned numerous events and never have I had such an easy time working with the venue staff. . What could have been an absolute panic turned into a glorious experience.

We held a Wedding Rehearsal Dinner reception outdoors at the Patio and Marina View for our son and his wife in July, 2021. They had already planned their wedding for an outdoor ven...

ue the next day, and we were so glad to be accommodated by the Doubletree at the Berkeley Marina. We had 90 guests and it was a great experience in so many ways, both from the professionalism and friendliness of all the staff who worked together smoothly as a team, to the beauty of the location and delicious food that we were served. The Director of Catering and Conference Services, Natasha, was so helpful with planning, immediately responsive with every email inquiry, and positive and thoughtful throughout. Our party was outside on the Patio where there was plenty of room, open and airy for these Covid times, and tables were set beautifully for our for our guests. That outdoor venue is so gorgeous. (It can be a little chilly with the Bay, but just bring a sweater or wrap to be prepared) We also arranged for a microphone package so we could have speeches and songs during the event. I strongly recommend arranging for a microphone set up to meet your needs so everyone can easily hear. The support staff for the microphones stayed for the whole evening as we changed out the iPhones that got connected or moved from speaking to singing; he was so helpful. The food was so delicious, from salad and entree to dessert, and the wait-staff exceptionally courteous and helpful. A coordinator was assigned to handle any issues or questions during the party and she was amazing, too, as she helped me with some questions during the evening. I can't say enough about how lovely our event was and how much I appreciated the gracious, sincere, and friendly team at the Doubletree. I highly recommend this venue to you!

The DoubleTree by Hilton at the Berkeley Marina has the most amazing, hard working, dream making staff! Natasha Norman, our wedding coordinator at the venue, was always available w...

hen we needed and made our experience there a breeze! Essentially, she made it her job to make our wedding as stress free as possible. She never hesitated to answer questions or make suggestions. The food was excellent! My wife and I got raving reviews after the event! Everyone LOVED the steak! And the the entire kitchen and wait staff were amazing! The reception hall was arranged and prepped to our specifications and we felt Natasha did everything possible to make it exactly as we wanted. Bottom line is, if you are looking for a worthwhile venue in the Bay Area, this is definitely a strong option, if not the best!
