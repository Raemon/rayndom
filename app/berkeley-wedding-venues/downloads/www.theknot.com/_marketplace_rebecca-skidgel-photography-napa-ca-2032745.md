Becca

Owner

I’m a high-spirited, fun-loving, energetic human being. I’m also a photographer (duh), chocoholic, burrito enthusiast, and a lover of hiking, traveling and adventuring of all sorts. I absolutely LOVE being a wedding photographer. I love meeting and connecting with new people. I love seeing the different traditions each culture and family has. But most of all, I LOVE watching the stories and emotions unfold in front of me and I get the honor of capturing that so you can cherish those moments forever! How is that not the best job ever?!

We are absolutely thrilled with Rebecca's work! From the moment we booked her for our engagement and wedding photos, we were excited by her enthusiasm and attention to detail. Our ...

preparatory Zoom call helped us clearly understand her plan and share some of our ideas/themes, which she easily incorporated and even built upon. The vibes were perfect and she’s an absolute pro. Neither my fiancé nor I are the most comfortable in front of the camera, so we needed someone who could bring us out of our shells and make the experience fun. Becca did that and more! She made us feel completely at ease, and we couldn’t imagine working with anyone else. Even when we had to reschedule our shoot last-minute due to illness, Becca was incredibly understanding and flexible. On the new day of the shoot, she arrived early in San Francisco to scout locations, and when one didn’t work out, she quickly shared a potential backup plan that we absolutely loved. She suggested a new spot and even included our dog, which turned out to be a great call! Those photos ended up being my absolute favorites, and I’ll treasure them forever. This whole experience has made me even more excited for her to also capture our wedding day! We can’t recommend Becca enough - she’s amazing! :)

Never having been to Napa, I was seeking someone to help me put together the perfect vineyard proposal and Becca delivered in every way. Becca was integral in making our big moment...

a success. From helping me choose the venue to personally scouting out where I would get down on one knee, Becca was warm, communicative, and professional. Most importantly, she captured the absolute shock on my new fiancée’s face as I popped the question and our pure happiness in the moments that followed. We will cherish that moment in time that Becca captured for the rest of our lives and cannot wait to share it with our loved ones.

ly at ease and genuinely excited about our wedding. She helped us plan out the timeline, suggested beautiful locations, and offered such helpful guidance throughout the whole process. On the day itself, Becca felt like both a professional and a friend — calm, kind, and completely invested in capturing our story authentically. We never once felt awkward in front of the camera; she made the experience so natural and fun. When we received our photos, we were blown away. Every image felt like a piece of art — full of emotion, light, and detail. She perfectly captured not just the scenery, but the feeling of the day. We’ve already looked through them a hundred times and will cherish them forever. We truly can’t recommend Becca Skidgel enough to any couple considering a micro wedding or elopement. Her talent, professionalism, and heart shine through every photo.

a magazine, yet still feels so us. Her work is truly timeless. Beyond her incredible talent, Becca was organized, communicative, and made the whole process so easy and stress-free. We always felt supported from start to finish. On our wedding day, she made us feel completely comfortable in front of the camera. My husband is usually camera-shy, but in every photo, he’s smiling and at ease. He even said it was the first time he didn’t feel awkward being photographed because it felt so natural — like there wasn’t even a camera there. Becca truly let us be ourselves, and it shows in every image. We love reliving our wedding day through her photos over and over again, and we would trust her a thousand times over.❤️

e other hand, does not like having his picture taken and questioned why we even needed to hire a photographer. I loved Becca’s photos I saw online and immediately knew I wanted her as our photographer from our very first phone call. Becca was incredible to work with, from all the communication before the wedding, to the day of the wedding itself. She is professional, organized, fun, and extremely talented. She made both of us feel comfortable and we had so much fun. She left us some polaroids that night and sent a ton of sneak peaks only 3 days later. The photos are absolutely stunning! Becca exceeded both of our expectations and we truly cannot recommend her enough.

Her dedication and flexibility made it clear that we could completely trust her to bring our vision to life. Leading up to the wedding, she sent a detailed questionnaire and a customized timeline. She was also open to our ideas—even taking photos with Taco Bell! On the day itself, she kept everything running smoothly, keeping us on time without ever making us feel rushed. We’re both a little camera-shy, but she made the whole experience genuinely fun, like spending time and laughing with an old friend. Becca captured our day beautifully, with every special moment documented. Don’t hesitate to book her—you won’t find anyone better!

she capture the most perfect engagement photos, but she captured US in our wedding pictures... our love, our personalities, our FUN. Not only is she an amazing photographer, but she is the best hype girl to get you excited throughout the wedding day! Leading up to the wedding, she scouted our wedding venue to find the perfect timing for sunset pictures, and helped our wedding planner lock down the perfect timeline. She is always so responsive when I had questions, which I really appreciate. Day of, she took incredible pictures of my husband and I, and SO many behind the scenes pics that I wasn't aware of until I got our sneak peeks! She kept us on time, took incredible pictures, and really execute dour plan, which was to take pictures but also make sure were were able to enjoy cocktail hour, which we did! Becca and her team captured SO many special moments that I will cherish forever and I cannot recommend her enough! 10 Stars if that was an option!

atural and fun. My husband and I were both nervous for photos but had full faith that Becca would know how to pose us without looking staged. Once we started working together, I was immediately impressed by how organized she was. She knew all the questions to ask and offered all the best advice to give us the exact photos we wanted from our day. On our wedding day, Becca was quick and efficient. She made taking tons of photos in the hot sun fun and we never felt like we were posing. Our photos are better than we ever imagined. There was not a single photo I could pick apart or dislike. I wanted our photos looked natural and to depict how the day really was. That is exactly what we received. I didn’t know we could photograph this well. We will never be able to thank Becca enough for capturing memories that we will cherish for the rest of our lives. We can say with 100% certainty that you won’t regret booking Becca!

We had many friends and family members tell us how great she was and she felt more like a friend than a vendor. As for the photos, holy cow, not only did she get absolutely stunning photos, she truly captured the essence of the day. The quality of her work is incredible and we don't know how she managed to get such a variety of shots (we're convinced she may be able to teleport). If you're looking for the best photographer for your event, congratulations because you've found her. Becca, thank you so much for giving us the gift of being able to relive our favorite day through these photos, we can't express our gratitude enough!

ith. Becca was so professional and the photos came out amazing! The experience left such a good impression on us that when it came time to plan our wedding, we wasted no time booking her even before our venue. Working with Becca has been great. Neither my fiancée or I have ever worked with photographers before, and yet we've felt so at ease with Becca. For our engagement photos, she was communicative and helped us plan what to wear/ prepare in advance. When she arrived to the site (on time of course), she was ready to start shooting. We had a wonderful time and feel Becca brought out the best in us during the entire shoot, creating images that we will cherish forever. We are incredibly grateful for her artistry and dedication to making our day even more memorable. The pictures we’ve seen so far have been nothing short of amazing and we cannot wait for the wedding photos! We highly recommend her to anyone looking for a photographer who not only takes great photos but is also a blast to work with while still giving great direction!

ots. We found Rebecca by chance online and could not be happier!! She is a total professional throughout the booking process and when we met her in person her demeanor instantly put us at ease. She reacts to your needs and personalities as clients and is constantly keeping an eye out for great shots. We felt Iike we were just hanging out for an hour rather than doing a photo shoot. We were amazed at the photos that she was able to capture for us after just having met us minutes before. Definitely work with Rebecca if you have the chance you will not be disappointed!!!!

Both my husband and I were a little nervous for photos because neither one of us is comfortable in front of the camera, but her positive attitude and coaching made the experience really enjoyable! Overall, she we feel like she really listened to what we wanted, but also provided great suggestions based on her expertise! We're so happy with the photos and the memories she helped capture from our wedding!!

s one of the best in the area and you NEED her as your photographer. From couples photos, engagement photos and now most recently our wedding sneak peek photos, Becca is truly one of a kind in her craft. She is extremely organized, communicative, and FUN! We love her editing style, her talented eye, and the ability to whip through group photos as if she has memorized the entire list. She is also super flexible if your time is running long or plans change on the fly! Becca will do whatever it takes to capture your day exactly how you want it captured. Neither of us had planned a wedding before; Becca was super helpful in answering our questions based on her many previous wedding experiences. So many friends have already asked us for Becca's information upon seeing our wedding photos because they are so, so beautiful. She is 100% worth the investment, don't hesitate to book her immediately as she gets busier every year for good reason! Becca, we can't thank you enough for capturing our big milestones over the years, you are the go to and we are clients for life!

We absolutely LOVED working with Rebecca for our engagement photoshoot!! My fiancé and I had a trip plan to visit CA and I had wanted to try and have our engagement photoshoot done...

at Muir Woods. I started googling photographers in the area and when I came across Rebecca's photography page, I instantly fell in love with her work and the energy that her work captured in each photo. So I reached out to her and shortly afterwards, we set up a skype call to meet and discuss details and then a few weeks later we were in CA having our photoshoot. She was excellent at communication on making sure to check in with us before and after the photoshoot, letting us know if we needed anything beforehand, and more. Our experience with her was perfect. I'm in love with the preview pictures we got back so far and can't wait to see the rest of the album! If you are in the CA area, I HIGHLY recommend booking a session with Rebecca!! She is an absolutely sweetheart and I loved how she brought so much joy and laughter into our photo session. It was an experience we'll never forget!

tely surprised that she said we would have a "sneak peak" in the next day or so and then the full gallery in a couple weeks. The sneak peak was everything I could have hoped for and I could barely wait for the full gallery. Rebecca's what to wear/bring guide really helped and she was super responsive if i had any questions before our shoot. Before our shoot we shared some inspiration shots from Pinterest and got straight to work. I loved that Rebecca knew what time of day would be best for our beach photo shoot and just in case we had some bad weather gave me options for rescheduling. 10/10 would recommend as the best photographer in the Bay Area.

I had the pleasure of working with Becca for a surprise proposal photoshoot in Napa, and I couldn’t be happier with the results. From start to finish, Becca’s professionalism, crea...

tivity, and attention to detail truly stood out. Planning and Communication: Becca took the time to understand our story and vision. She asked thoughtful questions about our relationship, the proposal location, and our preferences. Her communication was prompt and clear, which made the planning process seamless. The Proposal Moment: Becca’s discreet presence during the proposal was remarkable. She captured every emotion—the nervous anticipation, the surprise, and the sheer joy—as I got down on one knee. Her ability to blend into the surroundings allowed us to focus on the moment without feeling self-conscious. The Post-Proposal Session: After the proposal, we had a couple’s photoshoot. Becca’s direction was gentle and encouraging. She made us feel comfortable, and it translated beautifully into the photos. The candid shots captured our genuine laughter and love. The Final Photos: Becca’s editing skills are top-notch. The gallery she delivered was a mix of candid moments and stunning portraits. The colors were vibrant and we were thrilled with the variety of shots she provided. In summary, Becca’s photography is a blend of artistry and authenticity. She not only documented our special moment but also created timeless memories that we’ll cherish forever. If you’re looking for a photographer who goes above and beyond, Becca is the one. Thank you, Becca, for making our proposal unforgettable!

Leading up to the big day, Becca scoped out the venue, advising on perfect photo timings based on sunset. On the wedding day, her bubbly personality made the stressful moments easy. She guided us through poses, captured candid shots, and worked like a pro all evening. Post-wedding, Becca shared sneak peeks that left us speechless. We're eagerly awaiting the final photos!

She answered any and all questions we had leading up to the day and was super precise with the timeline, and really gave us peace of mind. Working with her took loads of pressure off me, my now husband, and our families because she thought of everything without us even having to ask. She arrived promptly on the day of the wedding, and was professional and friendly. She brought a lot of fun , positive energy to the day without being distracting in any way. She made sure to get every shot we hoped for and others I didn’t even know to hope for. Just couldn’t have been better from start to finish!!

s a couple, as well as any combination of shots with your new spouse, family, and friends, Becca is the right photographer for you. We initially came across Becca after scrolling through her Instagram. After meeting with her, we could immediately tell that she would be a great fit for our wedding based on her high energy, can-do attitude, and eagerness to connect with our vision. Throughout the planning process, she was incredibly organized and collaborative to ensure that we would get all the photos that we had envisioned, along with some fun ideas she had (hello, champagne popping under twinkle lights!) that aligned perfectly with the vibe of our big day. Her positivity and general energy were exactly what we needed the day of the wedding - lightheartedly not putting up with nonsense from family and sticking to our well thought out timeline so that we could get to spend as much time as possible together and with our family and friends. Not only were our final photos BEAUTIFUL, but she made the entire process stress-free and fun. She is truly a dream to work with.

f us are from Singapore and we wanted to take pretty pictures in Napa Valley when we were visiting in the Spring of 2023 to display on our wedding day. After researching countless of photographers who could shoot in the Bay Area, we finally decided on Becca because we loved her portfolio and her vibes as a photographer (lively and lighthearted!). From the onset, Becca kept an open line of communication with us even though we were halfway across the world from her! She provided us with her very handy guidebook and even allowed us to consult with her over Zoom and WhatsApp as and when we needed to regarding suitable locations and outfits for the kind of photos we wanted. She was even kind enough to send us recommendations for general things to do/see around Napa Valley considering it was our first time there! During the shoot, Becca made us feel immediately comfortable in front of the camera. Her directions were clear and she was overall such a joy to be around. The pictures came out beautifully and we are very happy that we went with Becca! Choose Becca, y’all, you won’t regret it!
