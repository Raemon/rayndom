**About The Knot Registry Awards:**What Are They | Selection Process | What's Next




## What Are The Knot Registry Awards?

The Knot Registry Awards are annual prizes that aim to relieve some of the decision fatigue of wedding planning by offering couples an extensively researched, hand-selected group of exceptional wedding gift ideas. Since 2016, our eagle-eyed registry team evaluates a product's value yearly through internal data, trusted independent reviews, in-person merchandising reviews and an outside nomination process to ensure each lives up to the hype. 

## How Are the Products Selected?

Every winner is selected by our registry team, a crew with an extensive background in buying, merchandising and styling in the home and lifestyle spaces that always has their collective ear to the ground. While their intuition is spot-on (it's scary, honestly), the team also relies on a rigorous five-month research process encompassing internal research, external studies and hard data to determine what products deserve to be award winners. 

FEATURED VIDEO FROM THE KNOT

First, the registry team scours our [The Knot Registry Store](https://www.theknot.com/registry/store/) numbers, studying what our couples frequently register for, what brands and products they regularly search for, what they review highly and what gifts guests scoop up first. The selection committee then digs deep into our detailed internal studies, like our annual [Real Weddings Study](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-data-insights/real-weddings-study) and Wedding Registry Study as well as external studies to decipher the price points and categories that truly matter to couples. Additionally, the team consults hundreds of independent reviews and detailed nomination forms, and carefully sifts through sample product submissions by hand in our NYC office. Also top of mind: the top [wedding registry trends](https://www.theknot.com/content/new-wedding-registry-trends) for the upcoming year as well as relevant trends on Google search, Pinterest and social media platforms to stay ahead of the curve. 

## Gift Card, Service & Experience Winners

Maybe you've been cohabiting for a few years and you already have your home stocked, or perhaps your love language as a couple is quality time versus gift giving. In our most recent The Knot Registry Study, 43% of couples say they're not looking to add physical gifts to their wish lists. But these goodies for your [gift card registry](https://www.theknot.com/content/gift-cards-wedding-registry), services and fun experience presents will make newlywed life sweet. (And don't worry, it's not against [wedding registry etiquette](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-registry-etiquette) to skip the tangible gifts.)

### Pressed Floral Preserved Wedding Bouquet Gift Card

Nostalgia and sentimentality is _in_ for weddings. And what's sweeter than getting a gift card toward making a precious memento of your celebration?

This unbelievably sexy toaster (it's true) has six browning settings to get your bread as crispy as you please. This Italian-designed appliance is delicately pleated, almost like a cupcake wrapper. You won't want to tuck this baby away on a pantry shelf or in an appliance garage.

## Why You Should Add These Winners to Your Registry

Real talk: There are countless lists out there that tell you [what to put on your wedding registry](https://www.theknot.com/content/best-wedding-registry-ideas) (we know, we've written a few), but our whole mission with The Knot Registry Awards is to help you cut through the noise. One of the best [registry tips](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-registry-26-top-tips) we can give—besides to stick with what's timeless, quality and feels personal to you—is to not let anxiety over choosing "the right things" take the fun and excitement out of the process. You're getting married; focus on the joy and let us take care of the wish-list heavy lifting. 

"Our goal is to curate a diverse selection that reflects both timeless favorites and fresh discoveries, ensuring couples have access to the best options across all categories," says Sam Kaplan, senior manager of registry at The Knot. "Ultimately, we want to simplify the process so couples can focus on what matters most: celebrating this exciting chapter in their lives." We'll keep putting in the work year after year to keep your registry experience seamless, so you can spend less time trolling Amazon reviews and stressing over sheet sets and more time basking in that to-be-wed magic. And to make your life even easier, your wish list will automatically populate in its own clearly marked tab on a The Knot [wedding website](https://www.theknot.com/gs/wedding-websites), so [sharing your registry with guests](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-to-let-guests-know-where-you-registered) is easy.
