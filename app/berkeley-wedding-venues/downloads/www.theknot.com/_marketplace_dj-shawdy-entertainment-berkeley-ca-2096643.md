Rashad was a God send from beginning to end! He asked questions I didn’t even think of and made sure everything was in place for our special day. Any time I asked a question or had...

a request I felt extremely comfortable asking because he always responded with such kindness. Not once did I have any doubts. Rashad was very punctual and had great communication with both me and our wedding coordinator. Most importantly my guests had an AMAZING time with Rashad as our DJ. I highly recommend and honestly do not have any negative feedback whatsoever.

DJ Shawdy was incredible! Cannot recommend him enough. We booked him for our wedding, and he made sure that we and all our guests were taken of, went above and beyond, and provided...

a lot of personalized touches. He made sure the dance floor was very lively and that all of our guests had an amazing time. His communication before the event was amazing and he was extremely thorough in going over details and even thought of unique and fun touches/things to add to our song choices. He can definitely read the crowd and match any style, and got everyone on the dance floor, from our youngest cousin to our oldest grandparent. You should absolutely book him for your event.

We had the most wonderful experience working with DJ Shawdy for our bicultural wedding! He was organized and professional at every stage. The process was super simple: we met for c...

onsultation/planning, I sent him several different Spotify playlists for different parts of the night (e.g., dinner, ceremonies, dances) and DJ Shawdy executed it all flawlessly. We had multiple specifically timed transitions throughout and between our two ceremonies (Iranian and traditional western), and DJ Shawdy made the process seamless. He also balanced playing songs from two different languages throughout the night, and was effective at reading the audience. He provided beautiful lighting and handed out lightships and various glow party supplies which was such a fun touch. We truly have zero complaints, and could not have had a better DJ. He helped us brainstorm ideas we never would’ve thought of and he made all our dreams a reality! Thank you so much, Rashad!

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! We cannot recommend DJ SHAWDY enough! He went above and beyond for our October wedding, from start to finish, everything flowed perfectly. He followe...

d the timeline seamlessly, kept the energy exactly where it needed to be, and made every single moment feel effortless and fun. Our guests loved him, especially when he got the guests involved during the kissing couples game (seriously, ask him about it!). It was such a hit and had everyone laughing and cheering all night. You can tell he genuinely cares about making your day perfect. His professionalism, attention to detail, and ability to read the room were next level. We were absolutely amazed by his hard work and the way he kept the celebration going strong from ceremony to last dance. If you’re looking for a DJ who will make your wedding unforgettable, DJ SHAWDY is your guy. Thank you again, Rashad!!!
