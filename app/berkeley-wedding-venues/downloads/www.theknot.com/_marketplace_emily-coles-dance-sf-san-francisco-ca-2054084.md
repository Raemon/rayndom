Emily Coles

Owner

My dance career began at the age of 5, prancing on stage with little girls in tu-tus. I loved the stage, but not the tu-tu . For 20 years I pranced on stages, searching for the "right dance". The search included modern, jazz, Afro-Cuban, and finally salsa. To salsa I added a full range of ballroom, Latin and social dances, which I have now taught for over 15 years. Anything that creates joy has a positive impact on our complicated world, and that positive impact is important to me. We need more dancing. We need more music, more singing, more laughing. We need more dorking around :)

lexible and will figure out a way to make things work within your timeframe/needs/budget! Due to some health issues we ended up only able to schedule 2 sessions with her, but it was still totally worth it! Emily not only taught us some basics of how to lead/follow, but also helped us choreograph a simple yet beautiful dance that fit perfectly with our slightly unique first dance song choice. We had such a fun time working with her, and she made us feel so much more confident in taking on the slightly daunting task of our first dance! Her patience, warmth, humor, and clear instruction made the lessons feel so easy and fun. She taught us a lot and also listened to our feedback and left us feeling encouraged and confident . While we only got 2 lessons in, it truly made all the difference and set us up perfectly to keep practicing and feel fully ready for our 'performance' at our wedding. YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY BOOK HER!!! Thank you so so much Emily!!

CHOOSE HER NOW! Emily blew our expectations. She is so much fun and has the warmest heart. She expertly crafted an elaborate 5 minute dance for us, combining 2 songs into 3 parts. ...

It took us 20 classes, 1x week. We didn’t practice outside of class once, but nailed it on wedding day! (I know she choreographs simpler dances too.) Her dance class ended up being the highlight of our week because she makes it so enjoyable! She filmed our progress, so we could learn from the recording—but also so we could make a montage of our progress! Classes are easy to book on her Calendly and are absolutely worth driving to Potrero for! After class, go out to dinner nearby. I suggest Papito!

Our vision for a first dance started with a vague notion of dance style with an atypical song. We completed weekly sessions (totaling 9 sessions) with Emily. Our first session, we...

reviewed our song, general ideas for the dance (length, different elements, overall vibe), and basic partner dance steps. By around the 5th or 6th session, we had full choreography for our 3.5 minute song and were transitioning to refining our style and technique. Our last session was spent polishing and adding finishing details. Dance sessions with Emily were a delight to attend and easily a highlight of each week (served as date night and was a wonderful break from other wedding planning). She was extremely accommodating with scheduling each week and utilized our full hour sessions wisely. On our wedding day, we were very relaxed dancing because of how prepared Emily helped us become and we truly got to enjoy this special moment rather than worry over remembering steps or being watched. Our first dance was easily one of the biggest talked about aspects of our wedding. It was a huge highlight for both us and our guests and would not have been possible without Emily’s expertise and ability to make performing fun. We highly recommend Emily for dance lessons for your special day! https://www.capcut.com/presentation/7288142903531077638?workspaceId=7288141570484830213

Emily is the absolute best!!!!! As a lesbian couple, we did a lot of research to find a dance teacher we could feel comfortable with as we learned the first dance for our wedding. ...

We were so lucky to come across Emily! We wanted to do a fun, cheesy, over-the-top dance to an 80s banger, and she was ALL FOR IT! She fully choreographed our first dance with all of the flair we wanted, and she taught us how to do a lift, multiple dips, and coordinated moves that truly wowed our family and friends! We went in with hardly any experience, and she broke down each part of the dance in very easy to digest pieces where we learned the proper body mechanics (so we didn't bust a knee or a hip lol). We are so incredibly grateful for all of the time we had with her during the lead-up to our wedding. Our lessons gave us such a breath of fresh air during our wedding planning, and after the big day we missed her so much that we decided to go back and learn Salsa with her!!!!! Thank you so much for making our special day the best ever! We still hear so many of our guests say that we did the best first dance they had ever seen :).

In preparation for our wedding my partner and I decided to learn how to dance together. We found Emily after doing some research on dance instructors in the Bay Area. We focused on...

learning Foxtrot and Salsa for an hour each week. She was very accommodating, responsible and reliable as we navigated safety measures during the pandemic. Not only were we able to make great progress but we also had so much fun throughout the process. She is an immensely encouraging, patient and kind dance teacher. Our dancing during our wedding was a success and we now feel confident on the dance floor. We love our dance classes with Emily so much we have decided to continue going to them even after the wedding.

nce and I left each lesson feeling very good - we viewed them as date nights! It was just such a pleasure learning from Emily. I have stage fright and likely suffer from social/performance anxiety (undiagnosed), but came away feeling excited during my real wedding dance. If you want the crowd to see you in awe and cheer you on during your dance, please choose Emily. If I could post a video here, I would! It's important that you know that I could have never imagined looking forward to dancing - an impossible situation. Turns out I was looking very forward to dancing during my wedding night - all thanks to Emily. That said, make sure to practice, as well as tip Emily.
