Details

Designed to feel authentically hand-drawn, these place cards feature marker-style lettering that spells out each guest’s name near the base, followed by their assigned table number. The clean sans-serif typography pairs perfectly with the smart color palette, providing a simple yet standout detail for your tablescape.   
Select how many cards you would like printed and after you’ve placed your order, a designer will send you a spreadsheet to fill out your guests' names. After you’ve placed your order, send your completed spreadsheet to help@theknot.com with your order number included in your email, and a designer will send you a digital proof of all of your cards before printing.   
A variety of meal icons are now available! If you would like to include meal info on your place cards, simply enter your guests’ meal choices to your spreadsheet, ordered by meal preference - and our designers will include them in your digital proofs. 

**Size:** 3.5 x 5 inches
