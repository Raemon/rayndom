There has been a shift across industries toward products made in the USA, and the fashion industry is no exception (and weddings in particular—your wedding is not the moment for fast fashion!). But when it comes to wedding dresses made in the USA, what does that mean? What does it look like? And, importantly, how much does it cost?

"Made in the USA is more than just a label—it's a promise," says designer Alyssa Hoersten, whose bridal label, [Alyssa Kristin](https://alyssakristin.com/), is crafted in Chicago. "It's about quality, ethics and sustainability, but also about continuing a legacy of craftsmanship in our country." American bridal gowns are imbued with the creative spirit of the USA. "When a dress is designed in the US, it means the creative vision, sketches and patterns were all dreamed up by designers here," Hoersten says. "But when a dress is _manufactured_ in the US, that's where the magic really happens—it means skilled hands are bringing that vision to life right here at home. While design can happen anywhere, US-based manufacturing keeps things personal, ensures impeccable quality, and supports the talented makers behind every gown."

There are, of course, pros and cons to bridal dresses made in the USA—the largest con being that American-made wedding dresses can often come at a higher cost. "Gowns manufactured in the US are often more expensive due to higher labor and production costs," says [Katherine Tash](https://www.katherinetash.com/), whose pieces are designed and made in Los Angeles. "The cost of production continues to rise, making it increasingly difficult for myself and many independent designers to sustain local manufacturing. Despite this, my business remains committed to producing in-house because it ensures the integrity of our gowns, and it is one of the core pillars of our brand." (All that said, there is often a name-brand markup for luxury designer gowns that are manufactured outside the US—so shopping from smaller, independent designers might cost roughly the same and ensure the money is going back to the makers, not the markups.)

FEATURED VIDEO FROM THE KNOT

Another thing worth noting: Even bridal manufacturers in the USA often use fabrics and materials sourced overseas—think French lace, for example—and so they aren't totally immune to tariffs and other factors. Work directly with your designer or bridal consultant to make sure you're on the same page about what you're looking for. 

Here, we've rounded up 12 American [wedding dress designers](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-to-find-wedding-dress-designer-you-love) who are not just designing and manufacturing their pieces here in the US, but doing things their own way when it comes to fabrics, silhouettes and more.

  * Where Can I Find Wedding Dresses Made in the USA?
  * American Bridal Gown Designers to Know



## Where Can I Find Wedding Dresses Made in the USA?

You can certainly find American-made wedding gowns at [bridal shops near you](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/bridal-salons) and wedding dress retailers across the country, but since every label is different, make sure you are clear with your bridal consultant that you're specifically looking for wedding dresses made in the USA; call ahead to see how many designers they carry who manufacture here. And, since many American bridal designers are small businesses all their own, you might also be able to shop them online (check out Odylyne The Ceremony and LEIN) or at the label's own atelier. 

There is one thing to be clear about in your search, though: the distinction between "made" in the USA and "designed" in the USA. "'Made in the US' should signify that a gown has been designed, cut, sewn and finished entirely within the United States," Tash says. "Unfortunately, the term 'designed in the US' is often used to suggest a level of domestic production that does not exist. A gown can be sketched anywhere in the world, but its origin is defined by where it is made. Brides should look for the true designation 'made in the US,' not 'designed in the US.'" Hoersten agrees. "For brides who want a gown that's fully made in the US, a little research goes a long way," she says. "Many companies that market themselves as US-based are actually produced overseas." 

## American Bridal Gown Designers to Know

Note that some labels produce some of their gowns or collections domestically and others overseas to offer a variety of price points. For any labels in our American wedding dress designers list who use dual production practices, we'll call out exactly which pieces to shop for _truly_ made-in-the-USA wedding gowns.

**American bridal designers to know:** Alyssa Kristin | Amsale | Anne Barge | CINQ | Claire Pettibone | Elizabeth Fillmore | Enaura | Esé Azénabor | Katherine Tash | LEIN | Odylyne the Ceremony | Sareh Nouri




### 1\. Alyssa Kristin 

![Alyssa Kristin wedding dress](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/2e65cf09-1ba5-4cf9-9fff-73f446ff134f~rs_768.h-cr_0.599.3631.5440)

Hoersten was born in Iowa, raised in Wisconsin, and now lives in Chicago. "I'm a Midwest girl through and through," she says. So are her designs: All Alyssa Kristin gowns are manufactured in-house at her Chicago atelier. "As the daughter of small business owners, shopping small and supporting local was ingrained in me at a young age. Alyssa Kristin was started with the idea that brides deserve it all: a quality dress, made in the US, at an attainable price." Notably, manufacturing in the US comes with a much higher price tag than overseas production. "Labor, production and material costs all add up," Hoersten says. "But for us, it's worth it because it aligns with our values and part of who we are as a brand." 

When it comes to her designs, Hoersten takes a less-is-more approach. "Our design aesthetic is all about clean lines, effortless silhouettes and luxe fabrics that create a look that's both modern and timeless," she says. "Every gown is thoughtfully crafted for an impeccable fit—so you feel just as amazing as you look."

**How to shop:** Alyssa Kristin gowns are available at dozens of [bridal salons across the country](https://alyssakristin.com/pages/retailers) and around the globe, and at the by-appointment [flagship showroom](https://alyssakristin.com/pages/appointments) in Chicago. Little White Dresses can be shopped online and are made to order; brides can even mix and match bodices and skirts for [custom LWDs](https://alyssakristin.com/pages/build-your-own-white-dress). 

**Prices starting at:** $2,850, Little White Dresses starting at $1,195

An Amsale bridal dress is American fashion, personified. The brand's founder, the late Amsale Aberra, was the first Black female inducted into the CFDA, and she hand-selected the label's current design and creative team. Its gowns are made in the heart of New York City's Garment District, inside the label's Manhattan atelier. "From the first sketch to draping the fabric to hand-beading and final stitching, each Amsale bridal gown is made-to-order and individually crafted for each bride in the US," says chief creative officer Sarah Swann. "Our skilled team controls the quality of each dress in and out of our atelier to deliver the highest quality." (Note that while all Amsale collections are sketched and draped in NYC, just the signature bridal collection is manufactured there.) The process is a perfect fit for brides who gravitate toward American-made labels. "The Amsale bride appreciates timeless craft with modern uniqueness," Swann says. "Every gown is made exclusively for its wearer, showcasing and celebrating her individuality.

**How to shop:** Brides can shop Amsale signature gowns at [select bridal salons](https://amsale.com/a/apps/store-location-finder) across the US. They can also shop by [appointment at the label's new flagship](https://wwdb.amsale.com/apps/wedding_wardrobe/booking/onboarding) store in SoHo or book a [virtual appointment](https://wwdb.amsale.com/apps/wedding_wardrobe/booking/virtual-appointment) with a stylist from the SoHo salon. 

**Prices starting at:** $5,000

### 3\. Anne Barge

_Photo: Anne Barge_

The Atlanta-based label, which recently celebrated 25 years, has four distinct collections under its umbrella but focuses on its signature Anne Barge Collection when it comes to domestic production. (Creative director Shawne Jacobs opened a domestic production facility next to the design offices in 2022; the brand is on track to produce 50% of the collection there by the end of 2025.) Currently, there are 16 stunning gowns and 12 accessories made entirely in the US, from start to finish. Among them are the [Rhodes](https://www.annebarge.com/products/rhodes), [Inman](https://www.annebarge.com/products/Inman) (brides looking for color, take note!), [Coretta](https://www.annebarge.com/products/Coretta), [Rodgers](https://www.annebarge.com/products/rodgers), [Penn](https://www.annebarge.com/products/penn), [Caldwell](https://www.annebarge.com/products/Caldwell), [McKinley](https://www.annebarge.com/products/mckinley) and [Donatella](https://www.annebarge.com/products/Donatella) gowns. 

"Unlike hemming trousers or sewing a ready-to-wear dress, creating a luxury wedding gown requires months—sometimes years—of focused, hands-on training," Jacobs says. "Building this level of expertise takes time, but I'm incredibly proud of the team we've built and energized by the growth we're continuing to see in our domestic production efforts." As for the aesthetic? "The Anne Barge bride is effortlessly chic. She blends timeless elegance with a modern edge and values quality and the art of subtle details—elegance without excess." 

**How to shop:** Anne Barge Collection gowns are sold in a host of [authorized retailers](https://www.annebarge.com/pages/store-locator) and at two [flagship salons](https://shop.annebarge.com/atelier/) in Atlanta and New York City. The label also showcases its latest designs (and shares behind-the-scenes moments) on its website, [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/annebarge/?hl=en) and [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/annebargebride/). 

**Prices starting at:** $3,700

### 4\. CINQ

_Photo: Calenrose,__Dress: CINQ_

_"_ CINQ was created and developed in Los Angeles, California; this is also where we have our production studio and where all of our gowns are crafted and sewn by our talented team," says founder and designer Macye Wysner. But it's the American South that inspires her aesthetic. "There is something in the air in the South—an ethereal, dreamlike fog that rests in the morning light, a mystique that moves in the late evening sun," Wysner says. "Our gowns seek to capture this atmosphere, tying together modern designs with heritage. The gowns are delicate and diaphanous, lightly dancing over the body, constructed of layer upon layer of silk tulle and silk wool, creating a deeply atmospheric effect. Broomstick pleats pressed into light silk, corsets cinched in satin, feathered tulle flows one strata over another." In the latest collection, look for even more new textures and unique and highly artistic elements like raw hems, hand-sewn details and beading techniques—all created in-house. 

**How to shop:** Because every gown and accessory is made to order, CINQ highly recommends reaching out directly online to place an order, or coming into the Venice, California, [showroom](https://www.cinq.la/appointments). The label is carried at select [partner retailers](https://www.cinq.la/retailers) in Utah, Chicago and Dallas, but call ahead if you're looking for a particular piece as the full collection may not be available.

**Prices starting at:** $6,500

### 5\. Claire Pettibone

_Photo: Claire Pettibone_

Claire Pettibone's inspiration is vintage—and so is her design process. "We're old-school, so all of our patterns are draped and hand-drafted," the designer says. "Our embroidery, lace, silk and trimmings are sourced from European couture fabric mills that are celebrated for their artistry and craftsmanship. I sketch my ideas (also by hand!) and select the threads, flowers and motifs that go into these exclusive textiles, which are custom-made for us. We hand-cut each dress to order and use hand-finishing sewing techniques for a truly couture experience." Everything is made—designed, cut and sewn—entirely in-house at the label's Los Angeles atelier. The results are dreamy.

"When I think about a wedding dress, I have an ethereal, almost dream-like aesthetic in mind," Pettibone says. "I'm always striving to enhance each woman's beauty and leave her feeling empowered in her femininity. English garden, forest fairy, gothic vintage, floral goddess—these are a few recurring archetypes I love to design for. I believe true beauty is timeless, and a sign of good design is that your wedding gown will be just as beautiful in 100 years as it is today."

With Elizabeth Fillmore, every bride gets her couture moment. "The brand is based in Chelsea in New York City, and every gown is made in-house at the atelier/showroom," the designer says. "Brides work directly with me from the first fitting to the final try-on. This hands-on approach ensures each bride receives a one-of-a-kind couture moment." A small team of expert artisans works with 100% silk—plus French laces and custom bespoke beading that Fillmore designs with a European fabric mill—to produce each piece, all of which embody a cool, feminine aesthetic. "The EF bride is urban chic: cool, confident and intentional in her wedding statement," Fillmore says. "The latest collection showcases both sides of my signature aesthetic: clean, feminine lines, enhanced with soft, sculptural draping."

_Photo: Enaura_

At Enaura, it's all about artistry, and that is articulated in two different ways. "All of our clean, minimal gowns are made in our NYC studio," says founder and designer Sohil Mistry. "They focus on fit, structure and fabric, which we're able to fine-tune right here in our hometown. Our embroidered gowns are made in our atelier in India, where artisans specialize in incredible handwork passed down over generations. It's a mix that lets us stay rooted locally while honoring the craftsmanship that's such a big part of who we are." 

If it's American-made you're looking for, check out styles like the [Remy](https://enaura.com/collections/enaura/products/remy), [Jules](https://enaura.com/collections/enaura/products/jules), [Jada](https://enaura.com/collections/enaura/products/jada), [Eva](https://enaura.com/collections/enaura/products/eva) and [Quinn](https://enaura.com/collections/enaura/products/quinn), made right in New York City. "The Enaura bride is intentionally and emotionally connected to what she wears—she's looking for something that feels personal, beautifully made and meaningful," Mistry says. Being made in the Garment District only adds meaning. "It connects us to generations of craftsmanship and allows us to work closely with the people who bring our designs to life," Mistry says. "To us, 'made in the US' means being fully involved in the process—keeping production close, working directly with our team, and having the ability to maintain high standards and pivot when needed. It gives us production security, faster turnaround times, and peace of mind knowing everything is handled with care from start to finish."

**How to shop:** Enaura gowns are available at [exclusive retailers](https://enaura.com/pages/store-locator) in select cities nationwide. Brides can also [book appointments](https://enaura.com/products/enaura-atelier-appointment) at the label's NYC atelier; atelier appointments are $125.

_Photo: Esé Azénabor_

This Dallas, Texas-based designer is known for her intricate and artistic beadwork. For that reason, each gown's creation is totally unique—but they're all made right at home in Azénabor's Texas atelier. "While the creation process is a bit different for each unique piece, the majority of our gowns feature ornate hand beading," the designer says. "I design all of the collections myself, and my clients are invited to customize their garment, or design their own bespoke garment, to suit their vision with our in-house teams in Dallas and New York City. After designs are completed, our production team creates each one-of-a-kind piece to the client's body measurements." 

These dresses are not for the faint of heart. "The Esé Azénabor bride is a confident woman who is looking for a stunning, one-of-a-kind piece for her wedding day," Azénabor says. "She is not afraid to make a statement! The brand's aesthetic is both bold and feminine and showcases quality materials and intricate detailing in every piece."

**How to shop:** Brides can start by exploring the collections [online](https://eseazenabor.com/), then booking an in-person consultation at the Dallas or New York locations.

_Photo: Katherine Tash_

Tash was born and raised in Tacoma, Washington, and has called Los Angeles home for nearly 20 years. It's where she launched her namesake brand and where each and every piece is made. "Our entire collection is produced in our 6,000-square-foot private Santa Monica atelier," Tash says. "Every gown—from initial pattern development to final hand-finishing—is made in-house by our team of highly skilled artisans." 

The aesthetic is all romance and modern elegance, with a particular focus on the female form. "Our gowns are designed to complement and enhance the form, striking a balance between structure and fluidity," Tash says. Her dream was to create a modern atelier where old-world craftsmanship meets modern fashion. "There is a responsibility that comes with creating luxury bridal gowns," she says. "To me, that means overseeing every stage of production, ensuring ethical labor practices, and preserving artisanal techniques that might otherwise be lost in mass manufacturing." 

**How to shop:** Katherine Tash dresses are available in [25 bridal salons](https://www.katherinetash.com/pages/retailers) across the country and more around the world. The designer also has an appointment-only atelier in Santa Monica reserved for custom-design brides.

_Photo: LEIN_

From sketch to stitching, LEIN designs are made in New York City's Garment District, with the exception of a few specialty embroidery pieces that are handmade in India. While the manufacturing is done here, the fabrics themselves have a global appeal. "Our design process starts with the fabrics," says founder and designer Meredith Stoecklein. "We design and develop all our laces with our mills in Italy; each lace is unique and exclusive to LEIN. For our hand embroideries, we create each design with our mill in India." 

Fabrics in hand, the gowns are brought to life back home. "We are based in New York City. Every piece is made in our city's Garment District. This is something we are really proud of; every garment has the attention of our team from start to finish. We are making 'forever' pieces, heirlooms that can be cherished for a lifetime, if not more." The homegrown approach is intentional. "A LEIN bride wants to feel like herself on her wedding day," Stoecklein says. "We always design with the idea that these are pieces that could have been pulled from their personal closet, just elevated and romanced for such a special occasion." 

**How to shop:** LEIN's SoHo studio accepts [appointments](https://leinstudio.com/pages/appointments) for both collection and bespoke clients and hosts monthly [trunk shows](https://leinstudio.com/pages/trunk-shows). On the West Coast, brides can shop at [LOHO Bride](https://lohobride.com/). Look out for the new ready-to-wear collection, which will be shoppable online soon.

_"_ Odylyne the Ceremony is built on a foundation of whimsy, fantasy and nostalgia, embracing the idea that a wedding dress should feel like an extension of a bride's soul," says designer Stephanie White. "The brand's ethos is about celebrating the ritual of love with gowns that feel sacred, dramatic and poetic." All of Odylyne the Ceremony's collections are designed and manufactured in Los Angeles, with craftsmanship woven into every detail, including delicate embroidery and dreamy draping.

"We design for the bride who dreams beyond tradition. Our gowns are for the romantic, the free spirit and the visionary."

"At its core, the Sareh Nouri label is about being understated, blending tradition with modern sophistication," says the designer. "The brand's signature aesthetic focuses on clean lines, impeccable tailoring and subtle yet standout elements that elevate each design. Whether she gravitates toward graceful ballgowns, structured columns or romantic lace designs, the Sareh Nouri bride wants to look and feel regal, sophisticated and effortlessly beautiful on her wedding day." 

To achieve this, strict attention to detail is required, so each and every Sareh Nouri gown is made from start to finish in New Jersey, not far from the designer's flagship salon. "The creation process is a true labor of love," Nouri says. "Every design begins in my studio in New Jersey, where I carefully sketch each gown, drawing inspiration from historical fashion, romantic silhouettes and luxury textiles. Fabrics are sourced from the finest mills in Italy, France and Asia, including delicate Alençon and Chantilly laces, silk faille, radzimir and rich jacquards. Each gown is made by expert sample makers, with intricate techniques such as hand embroidery, delicate draping and hand-placed lace appliqués." And, since production is entirely in-house, it allows for customization, rushes, precise tailoring and quality control. 

**How to shop:** Sareh Nouri gowns are available at an exclusive network of [retailers](https://www.sarehnouri.com/store-locator/US) nationwide and at the label's [flagship](https://www.sarehnouri.com/flagship-salon) in Livingston, New Jersey. 

**Prices starting at:** $4,900
