Description

High-stakes glamour comes alive in our beaded short wedding dress, Vegas, designed for brides ready to hit the jackpot on love. Her vintage-inspired sheath silhouette hugs every curve, while her spaghetti straps and square neckline strike a sleek balance between playful and chic. Beaded lace strands shimmer like neon lights and dance with every move, whether striding down the aisle or owning the dance floor. Vegas isn’t just a dress; she’s an electric moment made wearable.
