Omg all of the linens provided by napa valley were beautiful. We had our wedding at a cute little lodge but the only linens provided were white well that just wasn't going to work....

We contacted Diana who helped me to pick out complimentary linen for my wedding, I went for the lamour cashmere for all the guest tables, ivory sequin for the cake and candy tables and my favorite was the ivory peony we used for our sweetheart table! All the guest were quite impressed. I definitely recommend them if you want your event to POP, and make sure you ask for Diana she is great so friendly and really wants your day to look how you envision it!

It was such a pleasure to work with Diana from Napa Valley linens. I had a previous vendor booked for linens but it was not working out. Luckily for me, I had an amazing venue who ...

worked with Napa Valley and had the selections available for me to view at one of our meetings. It was suggested that I meet with Diana to see the full linens on tables to get an idea of a complete look and I'm so happy I did! I called ahead of time to hold the linens and Diana was so kind! She was very patient and did not rush me as I took my time to make final decisions for our table linen choices. She was very friendly and easy to talk to about the vision I had for our wedding. She also suggested options when it was hard for us to decide on which tablecloth we wanted. They have alot to choose from in their showroom and can show you exactly how it would look on a table versus just looking at swatches. I would definitely use Napa Valley again for a big event! All of our linens were exactly what we ordered and all looked beautiful in our reception space. I am so happy we found them! Thank you so much for everything Diana! You were wonderful! Myesha

retty high, but this is expected for the quality and they are competitive with other companies who provide the same quality product. I looked at about 6 different companies and landed on Napa Valley Linens, and they sent me free samples in the mail. I decided I liked them and went to the show room, where my mom and I were able to lay out the linens on a table so we could get a better feel of what it looked like and see how everything looked together. I was so pleased on my wedding day and highly recommend them!

y laid back esthetic so we weren't planning on needing any rentals, especially linens. But as soon as we saw the space, we opted for a linen for the sweetheart table and the cake table. We were referred to Napa Valley Linens and it was one of the best decisions. Whether you're on a budget or not,they were very able to accommodate anything. Their material and supplies are extremely high quality. There are tons if options for any decor style. The staff is so amazing, I can't thank them enough. They are so welcoming and accommodating. They were able to deal with me being a high maintenance bride! Pick up and drop off of the linen rentals were extremely easy and made it very easy for me with everything going on during the wedding, it's such a relief to have a smooth and easy process with Napa Valley Linens. Will be going back here in the future!

eal. I also researched reviews on Yelp and the The Knot. They were all extremely positive and many of the reviews prominently noted Diana Cardenas. Whom we requested when we called Napa Valley Linens. We specifically worked with Diana Cardenas. She was fantastic, very helpful, professional and responsive. We met with her on a couple of occasions and also spoke on the phone regarding what we wanted to fine tune our order. Diana was extremely helpful in ultimately selecting the type of linens and the napkins that would complement the linens. We selected different linens for the Sweetheart and cake tables. Diana very nicely coordinated the guest table linens to match and complement the table flower arrangements. We can't say enough regarding Diana's level of quality service, professionalism, and overall she was great to work with. Everyone whom attended the wedding were in "awe' especially of the beautiful table linens and napkins along with the flower table centerpiece arrangements. Additionally, the piece of mind that we didn’t have to worry that the order would be fulfilled without any issues, was great. The linens and napkins were promptly delivered and picked up with any issues At the end of the day, Napa Valley Linens was exceptional. They exceeded our expectations of how beautiful everything looked. We would wholeheartedly recommend Napa Valley Linens for your upcoming Wedding. Diana Cardenas was EXCEPTIONAL and the Best!

sit with NVLs to meet with our linen consultant Diana Cardenas--I had previously requested many swatches to be sent to my home so that I could make the decision for our reception linens. On the day of our appointment with NVLs, I had my mind made up on the linens we were choosing for the wedding reception. When we met Diana, we provided a list of linens that we wanted to see and she so patiently brought each linen out and placed them on a table. I then asked Diana for her opinion and she began to work miracles. I did not end up with any of the linens I had initially chosen because Diana chose a combination of linens that were far more beautiful than I could have ever imagined. Thank you NVLs and Diana--it is your expertise, your amazing linens and the added NVLs special touch of elegance that took our wedding reception to a much higher level of beauty.

When I got engaged this past June I thought planning our wedding at the Westin St. Francis on Union Square would be a cinch. That’s because I’m the wedding catering manager there, ...

and I personally oversee 50+ weddings a year. Despite having witnessed countless brides overwhelmed with the volume of decisions they face, for some reason I thought our wedding would be different. After all, I have my preferred vendors, work with the best hotel staff on the planet, know my venue inside and out, and am surrounded by inspiration every single day. Well, I was wrong. Just a few days into the planning process, I experienced firsthand how intense it can be. My simple “to-do” list transformed into a spreadsheet with hundreds of questions. Though my fiance and I had a strong vision for what we wanted the wedding to look and feel like, there were still decisions to be made about every tiny detail. I needed to call in the experts. After taking care of the basics (signing the venue contract, finding a florist, DJ and wedding planner), one of the first calls I made was to Sharon at Napa Valley Linens. No matter how many weddings I see, I’m always amazed at how the right linens enhance the beauty of an event. I’ve had the pleasure of working with Sharon and her team on more than 200 weddings, and there was no doubt in my mind that she was the right person to work with. And I was right. Within a half hour of being greeted by the adorable puppies at her showroom, Sharon and I had selected the perfect variety of colors and textured fabrics I would have never put together without her advice. Since then, I’ve thought a lot about why Napa Valley Linens is one of my favorite vendors to work with. I think it comes down to five really important things. Here they are: Quality. I’ve definitely met brides who thought, ‘it’s just a tablecloth, right?’ Wrong. When you choose low quality linens, it shows at the event and in your pictures. High quality linens that are thoughtfully selected to fit your event add depth and beauty to a wedding, setting the tone for all of the other elements like flowers and place settings to really pop. Great linens are the baseline for making sure all of the details of your wedding show through, and Napa Valley Linen has the finest around. Service. I’ve placed dozens of orders with Napa Valley Linens on behalf of the brides I work with, and I’ve never - and I mean NEVER - waited longer than 5 minutes for a response from Alison, my day-to-day contact there. Experience. Even though I thought I knew what I wanted for our wedding, when I described it to friends and family I realized “black, gold and blush” didn’t exactly articulate the grand vision. One of the great things about working with the team at Napa Valley Linens is that they know exactly what questions to ask in order to understand what you’re trying to achieve. Artistry. When you really stop to think about it, creating the perfect mix of fabrics, colors and textures is actually really tough. That’s why we have fashion magazines and experts to help us with what to wear, right? Now combine that all the different elements: season, venue, time of day, event theme, lighting, flowers… I could go on. It really takes an artist to understand the grand vision and make sure every element will perfectly harmonize. That’s what you get from Napa Valley Linens.
