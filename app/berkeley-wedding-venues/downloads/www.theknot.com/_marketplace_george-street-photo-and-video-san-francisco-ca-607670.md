wanted both. They offer different packages and they were running a deal which a coordinator helped me figure out which would be a great fit. The coordinator helped me choose 2 photographers out of many they had based on their portfolios. They were extremely flexible with the way I paid since I had so many wedding bills, I could only make a certain amount of payments. My photographers delivered the pictures exactly how I wanted and now I am able to look at so many from that night. I can't wait to print out my photos and put it all over my house!

Unforgettable Memories Captured with Heart and Precision. <3 My husband and I couldn’t be happier with the incredible service we received from George Street Photo & Video. From th...

e very first phone call, their team made us feel supported and confident. As a first-time client booking photography and videography, I had a lot of questions—and the representative was not only patient and professional but genuinely enthusiastic about helping us understand every detail. We chose the 8-hour package with both a photographer and videographer, and it was worth every moment. As our wedding day approached, George Street stayed in touch, offering thoughtful reminders and tips to help us make the most of our photo and video sessions. Their planning website was a game-changer—it allowed us to map out the timeline, locations, and key people for each shot, ensuring everything ran smoothly. One of the best parts was getting to choose our photographer, Paola. She was an absolute gem—warm, attentive, and effortlessly engaging with our guests. Her ability to speak Spanish was a huge plus, allowing her to connect with our family in a way that made everyone feel included and comfortable. Even now, our loved ones still talk about how wonderful she was. While we didn’t get to choose our videographer, Ryan turned out to be a quiet genius. Though more reserved, he had an incredible eye for capturing the most meaningful moments. His work speaks volumes, and we’re so grateful for the beautiful footage he created. The package also included a stunning 50-page printed photo book and full access to download all our photos and video. Both Paola and Ryan arrived on time and reached out beforehand to confirm our preferences, which gave us peace of mind and made us feel truly cared for. Sharing our wedding memories with family and friends has been such a joy, and we owe that to the talent and dedication of the George Street team. They didn’t just document our day—they helped us relive it, beautifully.

Lucy, they were professional, warm, and incredibly attentive to our vision. Dajauna our photgrapher had an eye for detail and made every shot feel natuarally intentional and beautifully captured. Whether it was candid moments or posed portraits, Dajauna captured the emotion and energy perfectly but was never intrusive. Her quiet professionalism captured so many moments I missed seeing during our reception. Turnaround time was quick, and the final edits were stunning. We couldn’t be happier with the results and would absolutely recommend Dajauna and the George Street team to anyone looking for timeless, high-quality photography. Thank you for making our memories last forever! Janet & Marcus Walley 9/14/25

Please save yourself the headache and do not book with George Street. The entire process was a nightmare of poor communication and logistical incompetence. Here's what went wrong:...

Photographer Bait-and-Switch: They tried to make us use one photographer for our engagement shoot and another for our wedding, defeating the whole purpose of getting comfortable with our photographer beforehand. Horrible Communication Policy: You are not allowed to speak with your photographer until the week of the wedding. This is an insane policy that adds so much unnecessary stress. Their coordinators are unhelpful and make absurd excuses. Glitchy Website: Their planning portal is a mess. The core problem is the middleman. By preventing direct communication between clients and artists, they create chaos. We spent more time fighting with coordinators than planning our vision. Work with a photographer directly.

He did both our engagement shoot and the wedding and was not only able to capture beautiful images but made it a fun process throughout. My only complaint was that it took us a month to get the pictures back (was hoping at least for a Sneak Peek sooner after the wedding) but we did have a summer wedding and this is typical for the industry. Cannot recommend George Street enough!

colors are washed out and over exposed. We gave immediate feedback, asked for more vibrant colors, and even sent photos from the same locations showing the actual colors and here we are months later and nothing looks any different. Our engagement photos are so awful I cried. It was too late to get another photographer for our wedding so gave the photographer feedback of what angles & poses we like and don’t like (even gave example photos of different poses/ideas for our wedding) and she essentially did none of them. We just got our wedding sneak peak photos are they just as awful as our engagement ones, despite multiple emails about how disappointed we were with the first color editing. For the price you would expect something much better or at least for them to listen to feedback and preferences. At this point, the photos our friends sent us from their phones look better than these so-called professional ones.

For the first look for my dad and I ( he had two rooms and I told Jim my photographer many of times my dad has two rooms can we do it in the clearer room and he flat out said no ) so this is the pictures I got. Dirty room. How about the only picture with our older son my husbands eyes are closed. Like wtf. We regret many of our pictures. I loved my wedding but the pic memories make us sad.

Mediocre. Our photographer didn't know how to do a "first look" pic - he focused the camera on me instead of my bridal party and dad. He also framed the all-guest posed shot poorly...

, so one of our guests is half cut out of the picture, and some guests are on the very edge, so when I printed the pic out, it didn't fit in an 8x10 frame exactly, and there are white borders on the top and bottom of the picture. The website is hard to navigate, and I ended up downloading all our pics and putting on a Google drive to share with guests so they didn't have to deal with it. Designing our album was a huge hassle - you can't rearrange the pictures, so if you want to change the order, you have to remove a bunch and then add them back.

ide what type of photography we liked to pair with a good photographer in the area. Our wedding photographer was Jessica L and she was fantastic! She kept us on schedule and took photos at the right angle, telling us how to pose. Our photos were also ready in 30 days and we were so excited to share with friends and family! Pricing was also cheaper since private/contracted photographers cost well over $5K. Overall we would recommend George Street for their professionalism, efficiency and good pricing.

I had a rough experience with Georgestreet. It was very hard to get ahold of my photographer before the wedding and she seems to have not seen my shot list and inspo board because ...

many of the shots I wanted were missed. I also had to keep responding to the same questions from Georgestreet (not the photographer) over in over, sometimes as many as 5 times, via email as if they weren’t reading what I wrote. Photographer seemed stressed on the day of the wedding and even snapped at a couple bridesmaids. We reached a point where I had to start directing what we would be doing next because she would take a long time to set up a single shot. Additionally, the photographer showed up the day of the wedding not even realizing she had shot our engagement photos. She also pulled me aside as I grabbed dinner only just realizing she hasn’t taken a photo of the full wedding party. There were a lot of issues and frustrations regarding photos. If I were to go back in time I would not rehire Georgestreet. The price was absolutely not worth it. My photos are alright but overall very unhappy with the experience and posing of photos. I was trying very hard to stick to a budget when I started planning but I wish I had gone for a better photographer. Georgestreet was so much unnecessary stress and I regret not having the amazing photos from a once in a lifetime day.

From Nicholas & Melody J Let us start with the booking process, having to plan everything based on what we see on the internet our trust in everything was on the borderline. Nico...

le Trier as our Wedding Consultant was able to answer our million in one questions/concerns. She was very informative and gave us great options on different photographers with different styles. We decided to go with Jessica L, we enjoyed her portfolio and background credentials. After booking, Georgestreet offers a Wedding Coordinator that is included in our package. This was very helpful, we utilized it especially towards the time stamps for the big day. We got to have a interview/conversation over the phone with our photographer Jessica L a few days before the wedding. This gave us an opportunity to go over the schedule and family photo templates/locations. After speaking on the phone with her, it gave us much more confidence towards the big day. Big day, Jessica arrived on time and very courteous and polite! She wasted no time and took picture of everything and anything. She knew we really would like candid photos of our intimate wedding and she delivered! We are so happy and blessed she got to capture our big day! Jessica gave us more than we could ask for! She brought our intimate COVID wedding out with the photos she took. Jessica was very flexible and able to work with us and our crazy family. We waited just a month for our photos to be available to us, Nora the Wedding Coordinator kindly sent us the credentials for access to our photos. All the photos were impeccable! They sectioned out in Albums. We received more photos than we imagined..500+! Nora was available to answer any of our questions even after services were provided! We appreciate the amazing customer service and wonderful quality that was provided by Georgestreet! Highly recommend! Thank you so much to the whole team!

Steve has an eye for a great photo: be it capturing the perfect moment, finding the best background, using the natural lighting or helping us strike the perfect pose. The photos he was able to capture will be cherished for the rest of our lives. We cannot thank Steve enough. George Street made the whole process so easy. Their online platform was easy to navigate, and our phone meetings helped keep details clear and answer our questions. Their day of timeline guideline was also super helpful in figuring out what shots we wanted and how much time to allot for different photo sessions. We would definitely recommend George Street for any couple looking for a photographer.

never told by our wedding planning contact about photo permits. We reviewed our day of plan about a month out with the planning team and told them where we planned to take our photos (local park). It wasn't until we had the final call with our photographer the week of our wedding that she mentioned we'd need a permit. It was too late to apply for one so we had to change around our plans for the day, causing issues for transportation, timing, and the look of our photos. The planning team needs to be more informed about permit requirements and tell couples early on.

being a photographer myself. As I started to read reviews, my thoughts became negative towards George Street. I stressed for almost a year on my choice. The week of my wedding, I spoke with Shannon the Photographer. She is seriously the sweetest lady. She calmed down my nerves and negative thoughts toward GSP. The day before the wedding rain was in the forecast. I kept in touch with Shannon on a plan B to have photos at the Hotel instead of the actual Venue since it was outside. The day of the wedding we decided to do the photos at the hotel. She came up with a new timeline and sent it to me. She met every single expectation, I had. She was kind, generous and made sure I was comfortable and everyone else was! I got a sneak peak of the photos and I am so happy I went with Shannon and George Street!

ith regards to video. We did our engagement photo shoot in Boston with Jessica, who was an absolute delight to work with. She also did photos for our wedding, along with Sergio. They were both amazing, and the photos came out great. We loved them. With video, due to religious/cultural preferences, we asked for a female videographer. However, we were first assigned a male (I found out by accident actually). At first they didn't budge about changing the videographer, and when they did find a female, they wanted to charge me a travel fee for her. At this point, it wasn't about the money - it was about the principle. As your customer, you should have figured things out on your end without getting me involved. Eventually, they gave in and took care of the travel fee. The day of the wedding - all goes well with video. Kendra was so sweet and managed to catch all the important footage of the evening. However, before the videos went for editing, I made some requests from the editors for things not to include in the highlight video. They've sent it to me twice, not taking into account those requests both times. It's now been 7 months since our wedding, and I still have not gotten that video. I'm pretty tired of waiting at this point, and just hope that someday they'll remember to send the corrected video to me.

If you like playing Russian Roulette, then this the choice for you! You choose a contracted photographer at random. The only factor you really have to base your decision is a handf...

ul of photos (the best of the best edits) by said photographer. Once you make your barely educated guess on a photographer you are locked in. A videographer will be given to you at random about a month before the wedding. They'll jokingly ask your opinion on specific shots you would like during the wedding. I say jokingly because they may or may not get the shots you asked for. I wanted a shot of my husband's face when he saw me coming down the aisle. We had TWO photographers and neither of them got that shot. This is only one of the few requests I made that was disregarded. I'm not even sure why we had a second photographer other than to have her photo bomb what would have been decent pictures. I gave specifics on family dynamics that should be avoided, this too was disregarded leading to awkward, avoidable situations. The pictures you do receive will be unedited and untouched up, basic things like cropping out the 2nd photographer. When we raised our concerns we were only given 50 free edits and an album of random pics that they deemed too dark/overexposed, and honestly you can never get the moments back to capture them at that point. We were told that we would be able to review the footage and make edits to the music in the video before it would be finalized. NOPE! One day we received an email saying our package was on the way and a video was shipped to us. The music skips in the video, transitions are awkward, etc. I cant wait to see how the album turns out... AVOID GEORGE STREET AT ALL COSTS!
