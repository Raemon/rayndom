## Frequently asked questions

Get answers to common wedding website questions below or [visit our Help Center](https://helpcenter.theknot.com/hc/en-us).

### Why should I create a wedding website?

Create a free wedding website so you have a central place for all the info youâd like your guests to know about your wedding. The Knot wedding websites integrate with [The Knot mobile app](/wedding-planning-app) and free planning tools like our [free guest list manager](/gs/guest-list) and helpful message templates to help you stay organized, track RSVPs, and keep guests up to date. Our free website templates are available in 100+ designsâmost of which have coordinating [wedding invitations](/paper/invitations/wedding), save the dates, place cards, thank you cards, and more for a cohesive look.

### How much does a wedding website cost?

Creating a website on The Knot is free, easy, and fun. Simply [choose a wedding website template](/gs/wedding-websites/designs) that fits your vibe then add your wedding details when youâre ready. You can buy a [custom domain for your wedding website](/content/domain-purchase-faq) through The Knot for $19.99 for 1 year or $39.98 for 2 years, if youâd like.
