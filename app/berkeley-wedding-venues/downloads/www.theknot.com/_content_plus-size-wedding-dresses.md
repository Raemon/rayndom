### Your Local Bridal Salon

If you're shopping for a [wedding dress](https://www.theknot.com/fashion/wedding-dresses) at least nine months in advance of your wedding date and looking for one-on-one attention and an extensive collection of gowns, you can't beat [plus-size wedding dress designer](https://www.theknot.com/content/finding-a-plus-sized-wedding-gown) gowns at your local bridal salon.

For starters, you'll get face-to-face interaction with a wedding dress expert to help guide you, taking the guesswork out of finding your perfect size and silhouette. Additionally, you have the opportunity to touch and feel the dresses you're considering, so you know exactly what you're paying for. Trust us, while dress photos may look dreamy online, there's a huge difference between high-quality fabrics and embellishments and low-quality ones in person.
