Description

The Dawn dress is a little white dress with a ball gown silhouette, crafted from delicate lace layered over tulle for a dreamy bridal look. Featuring a sleeveless square neckline, V-back, drop waist, and pleated full skirt, it’s elegantly finished with a chiffon sash that can be worn around the neck as a soft, romantic accent.
