We hosted an event in the Butterfly Lounge and Cafe Majestic and it was wonderful! The Hotel Manager was so helpful throughout the rental process and it was a breeze! The staff was organized and friendly, they even stepped in to help us create...

our cheeseboards when we were running out of time! The guests all loved the space and it added the elegance and beauty that our event needed!

I usually don’t like to stay in a historical hotel, not because of the history but because of the old things: bad bathroom structures, no elevator, old carpet... well, all the things that this hotel doesn’t represent. They were able to provide ...

the history with modernity. The old with a high level of care and maintenance. As a result, we got a great bedroom (huge, very comfortable and totally renewed on the floor), an amazing bath structure (shower was great, two sinks, a lot of space to put things), a huge and super comfortable bed, and a fireplace to give the room a nice touch. About the staff, we can only say good things: super kind, polite, helpful. They have an elevator that takes you to the bedrooms and also a good breakfast with usually four types of fruits, scrambled and boiled eggs, two types of bread, three types of bagels, and some kind of muffins. They also have orange juice, coffee, milk, tea, and a waffle machine. Oh! The coffee, water, and tea are free all day. The location is great, we could walk through a lot of places (Union Square, Painted Ladies, Alamo Square). They also have good options around for dinner, lunch, or a snack. Really a good customer experience. I super recommend that you stay here.

If you're looking for a charming, historic hotel in a great neighborhood, this is awesome. Was able to find street parking nearby. Standard room was tiny but nice and clean - bed really comfy. Property is well designed and smells good! Breakfa...

st area is really nice, breakfast itself was decent (and free!) - baked goods, waffles, cereal, eggs - would appreciate a meat option like bacon or sausage. But yeah, I would totally stay here again, especially for the price.

I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Hotel Majestic. The staff were all friendly and attentive, and my room was one of the most unique I’ve ever experienced. I usually stay at chain hotels like Hilton or Marriott—reliable and consistent—but Hotel Ma...

jestic offered something truly special. I booked the Queen Jr Suite and loved the vintage style, the spacious room, and especially the clawfoot tub, which was a standout feature. The neighborhood was charming and very walkable, with easy access to Trader Joe’s, Whole Foods, and a nearby corner store. The hotel’s central location also made it easy to get around—just a quick Lyft ride to most parts of the city. Although the fitness center was temporarily closed for renovations, I was still able to enjoy a good run through the neighborhood. A guest laundry facility would have been helpful for the amount of time that I stayed there, but I made due. Overall, I had a comfortable and pleasant four-night stay, and I would definitely recommend this hotel.

Don’t stay here!!!!! Rented the “king suite” for my Birthday and unfortunately it was a terrible experience…. We checked in at around 11:30 at night and were absolutely exhausted: we were looking forward to getting up to our room and going to ...

sleep, but upon entering the room my boyfriend immediately noticed how dirty everything was…. dirty floors, filthy damaged walls, bathroom faucets barely worked and that’s just to name a few things. My boyfriend immediately went downstairs to ask to be moved to a better “suite” but the woman working the desk said they had no available rooms at that time and to check back in the morning… Which is exactly what we did, but we were once again told there were “no rooms” available. We were told that the hotel manager (Amit) would be reaching out to us but that didn’t happen until the morning of our third night (when the TV’s in both rooms stopped working) and my boyfriend immediately emailed him (called front desk to ask for Amit’s email) to tell him that our stay so far had been a disaster and that we wanted to be moved or be refunded for our three nights and that we would check-out if a resolution could not be reached. The room I booked was supposed to be the nicest room this hotel offered and it was anything but. We were NEVER moved and NOTHING was done about the T.V’s either. The management did NOTHING and don’t seem to care about their guests in any way. I’m still trying to get my money back for this HORRIBLE stay. DO NOT STAY AT THI HOTEL. Side note: the ice machine on our floor was broken our entire stay and my boyfriend finally fixed it himself. If that gives you any indication of how they take care of their hotel.
