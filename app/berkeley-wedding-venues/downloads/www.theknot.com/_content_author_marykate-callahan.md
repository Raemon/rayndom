MaryKate "MK" Callahan manages digital content strategy for The Knot Worldwide, and leads all efforts related to affiliate and e-commerce content. She has considered working for an online magazine a "dream job" since she was a child, so needless to say, she’s thrilled to be working as part of The Knot's editorial team. 

MaryKate recently got engaged in Philadelphia, PA which is close to where she and her fiance both grew up (though they didn't meet until college.) If she’s not spending time at home in Hoboken, NJ she’s most likely on the beach with her family, book cracked open and rosé in hand.

## Experience

Before joining The Knot's editorial team, MaryKate worked as marketing manager on the audience development team where she worked across several brands to establish content analytics best practices. She also spent a few years working on [The Bump](https://www.thebump.com/)’s marketing team where she helped grow traffic from newsletters and community engagement across the site.

Prior to starting at TKWW over five years ago, MaryKate was working as copywriter at Imbue Creative, a small ad agency based in New Jersey. She also held several internships at tech companies where she discovered how content can help educate and empower users.

## Education

MaryKate attended Fairfield University, a small liberal arts college off the coast of Connecticut and just a train ride away from New York City. She graduated from the honors program with a bachelor’s degree in English and a minor in Communications. She also attended Universitat Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona, Spain when she studied abroad there during junior year.

Throughout college, MaryKate was a prolific writer and contributed to several online publications including _The Fairfield Mirror_ , _Thought Catalog_ and _Her Campus Fairfield_ , where she also worked as the site’s first Managing Editor. She also worked as the Promotions Director for Fairfield’s radio station WVOF 88.5, coordinating events with local musicians and managing on-campus promotion campaigns with Live Nation. She also had her own radio show called "MK’s Corner" which aired every Monday night featuring performances and interviews with local musicians.
