  * The Best Places to Buy Bride and Bridesmaid Getting-Ready Outfits



## Should the Bridal Getting Ready Outfit Match the Bridesmaids?

While matching wedding getting ready outfits are by no means required, there's a number of reasons we think you may want them. "Matching outfits go beyond just looking good in photos—they create a sense of unity and shared experience," says Ingrid Bonnor, founder of [Homebodii](https://us.homebodii.com/). "When the bridal party is coordinated, it brings a cohesive energy to the day, adding to the joy and connection of the celebration." According to Bonner, it's also a wonderful way to create lasting memories, as everyone feels included in something special from the moment they start getting ready together. 

When shopping for a bridesmaid or bridal getting-ready outfit, comfort is key according to Bonner. "After all, you'll be in these outfits for hours!" Because of this, she believes it's important to choose fabrics that breathe and move with you, like silk, satin, or soft cotton blends. Aside from how they feel, you'll also want to think about how your bride getting ready outfit will photograph. "Be sure to choose styles that align with the wedding's vibe," says Bonner. "Don't forget: getting-ready outfits can be more than just a one-time wear, so choose styles that can serve as lasting keepsakes from the day."

## The Best Places to Buy Bride and Bridesmaid Getting-Ready Outfits

Now that you know what to look for in getting-ready clothes for bridesmaids and brides, it's time to start shopping. Here, we've rounded up a few of our favorite places to find getting ready outfits, plus shoppable looks from each.
