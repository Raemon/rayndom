I loved working with the Bfab team for my wedding last month! I had a hard time trying to find a MUAH artist that I felt went with my vibe (more natural look) and wasn't trying to ...

push me on facials and treatments. I was so happy to find the Bfab team, who felt like real people who are great at their job and wanted to make my day perfect. Margo and Sharon were great to work with for planning (and even sent over NOLA recs when I mentioned I was going there for bach party!). I did a trial run which I found extremely useful since I had basically zero experience so it was useful to chat through options and learn what I did and didn't like so that it would be perfect on the big day. On the wedding day we had KaLa, Jennica, and Cindy come do hair and makeup for the bride, both mothers, and a handful of the wedding party. All three did a fantastic job! I was genuinely blown away by how amazing everyone looked at the end, I felt like a broken record saying "you look so beautiful" to everyone! And we had a range of people, from our mothers to my teenage niece, different ages and colorings, all were gorgeous. My bridal makeup and hair was absolutely perfect, exactly what I wanted. I also have to give a shout-out for their flexibility and grace under stress, since we had a power outage scare for a while, and all three of them stayed calm (which helped me stay calm!) and were super flexible on the spot, swapping the order so they could focus on heatless updo hairstyles and makeup until we had a generator with power for the curling irons for the remaining hairstyles. I would definitely recommend!

c job for my whole wedding party. Cindy nailed the hair style and natural makeup look I was going for. I was nervous about it all because I had never worn foundation before, but once we did the bridal hair and makeup trial, I knew I was in good hands. Cindy also went above and beyond on the day to help us conceal some tan lines and blemishes on our arms.

Bfab was such an amazing company! I reached out in February for my wedding in December. I didn’t have to to put a deposit done until the month of December, but they did send a cont...

ract I signed so I could secure them for that date. We had an issue with a bridesmaids makeup and I reach out the day before to see if someone could do her makeup and they sent my makeup artist early to do hers. Their veteran services pricing was fair for the San Fran area and I was absolutely in love with how my makeup and hair looked. I had an idea for both but not exact details and they were still able to create the exact look that I wanted the day of. Thank you for your wonderful work!

Bfab was amazing!! I had a really HARD time finding a HMUA at first, I was coming across all these HMU artists who were either too expensive or had way too much attitude. But when ...

I spoke to Margo, I knew I had found the right vendor. These folks are extremely professional and very organized! I got Carina as my HUMA and oh my I couldn't ask for anyone else.. I opted for a trial with her because I had to get 2 different looks (Indian traditional and western). Carina came home and worked with me on both looks very patiently. We collaborated and came up with ideas. She even made a PDF of her plan for my wedding day with all the notes from the trial day! For someone with an OCD for planning, this was great!! Bfab outdid all my expectations on the day of the wedding too! I had hired bfab for my bridesmaids' and mom's HMUA as well. Both artists were right on time, setup their stations quickly and got to work. Carina was just outstanding with both my looks on the day of the wedding...my husband's reaction at the first look and seeing me walk down the aisle were a great testament to her work! Most importantly, she made me feel beautiful on the happiest day of my life so thank you Carina! There was a slight miscommunication next day after the wedding with my bridesmaids' payment which I think could have been handled better but we sorted it out and I would still recommend this service to anyone who wants to avoid stress of HMUA choices.

bfab was so great for us. I loved being able to have all the hair and makeup done at my venue, it made it so much more of a relaxing wedding day morning having everyone come to us ...

instead of trying to figure out how to get all my bridesmaids (I had 8!) to and from the salon. I also loved that they worked exactly with my vision for my wedding. I don't do my hair or wear makeup EVER, so even the slightest amount of makeup is weird for me, so they kept a very natural and light look to my makeup which I really appreciated! Such an easy company to work with, they did the whole bridal morning schedule for me and all I had to do was make sure all my girls were there on time! I highly suggest using them for all your hair and makeup needs!

I felt beautiful. Sharon and Margo were lovely and set my mind at ease immediately, answering all my questions quickly and professionally. I booked them for my own make up, hair for and makeup for my bridesmaids, and make up for my mother. The stylists were prompt and professional, and did a wonderful job on all the girls. My mom felt and looked amazing, and did I. I specially request Hayley to do the make up for my mom and myself and she made sure to be able to be there for me, even giving me an extra lipstick when I didn't have one. I cannot recommend this service and these ladies enough!

I more gave her a starting place and asked her to go with how that worked for my face/eyes etc. I felt so beautiful and yet comfortable!

Even my father who never liked me to wear make up said that whoever did my make up should come over every morning! ;-) I would absolutely recommend them and will call on them again as soon as I can.

I used Bfab for my Bachelorette party in Napa and was very disappointed. When booking the appointments, I couldn't decide if I wanted two girls to come do our hair or one because w...

ith two people you pay two separate travel fees. However, we only had one full day together and I decided to spurge so that we could have more time all together. However, as we were spending our few hours all together outside someone comes in the yard and says she needed to start early and wasn't sure if the other girl was going to make it because of traffic. We had to stop our organized games because one girl had to leave which ruined the plans. The girl that hit traffic showed up an hour and a half late and with a friend. It seems very unprofessional and strange to bring a friend to a job but she didn't bother us. One of my friends decided she wanted her hair done last minute and the first girl stayed late to do it which was super nice so all in all everyone got there hair done but our whole schedule for the day was thrown off and we were late for our dinner reservation. When I emailed bfab asking for my travel refund for the second girl please see the unprofessional response below from Margo (she didn't make appointment on time, 1.5 hours late): ​Kristen, I can refund you Marcela's travel fee, though she did make your appointment on time and was able to do an extra girl. Asli was there on time (even early) and reported that you ladies were happy with the appointment. Everybody was done by the time that you had asked. Marcela's travel fee was even more deserved since she had to sit in that awful traffic to be able to get to the appointment since there was an accident that she did not have control over. The appointment was finished on time and bfab met our obligation. We did promise a refund of the travel fee for Marcela during the time that you were so angry. We will honor our word. Thank you, Margo. In business, everyone know you leave extra time for traffic when headed to an appointment. Margo should not make excuses for her employee or call the customer names like angry. Although everyone got there hair done, we had to throw off our whole days schedule because of bfab. I will not be using them again. I will stick to the drybar..

he highest regard. We apologize that you were frustrated with the schedule adjustment for your Bachelorette party. We appreciate your feedback and will take it into account for our business moving forward. Open communication and feedback is key when it comes to beauty, and based on the feedback from you and your friends you were all satisfied and happy with the end result. In regards to the refund, we refunded the travel fee the same day we received your initial email. It seems there was a delay between Paypal and your bank processing the refund. Despite the slight setback, we were thrilled that everyone was ready in time and happy with their hair. Again, thank you for the feedback- we always want to provide the best service possible. We wish you much love and happiness.

0am and looked beautiful and professional themselves. They started the event out with their professionalism and great communication skills. My daughter loved her trial about 2 weeks before and when our stylist, Natasha got there on the morning of the wedding she quickly and efficently got to work. There were 3 other stylists who were all talented and took care of our whole wedding party, as well as a few out of town guests. I will use bfab again for any event I am wanting to feel fabulous for and have even ordered them through their app since and loved them!!!
