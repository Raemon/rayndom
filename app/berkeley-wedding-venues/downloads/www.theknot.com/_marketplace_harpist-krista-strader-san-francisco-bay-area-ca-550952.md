Krista played for our wedding last week, and I'm so glad we chose her! She has an extensive list of music she plays. I was really hoping for a specific song to be played while I wa...

lked down the aisle, and was surprised to see it was already a song listed on her website that she plays! Her service really added such an elegant touch to the wedding that I loved. Not to mention she is absolutely gorgeous herself! Also important to note that she was extremely timely in her responses and was also very accommodating in the process of rescheduling our wedding from last summer due to COVID. We are so grateful for her and her beautiful music at our wedding, and can't wait to hear it again in our wedding video!

If you are looking for a ceremony musician, book Krista and you will thank yourself over and over in the future. Krista was pure excellence. We found her from a recommendation of...

our planner, and after looking at the large amount of varied material on her repertoire we booked a package that included both the ceremony and cocktail hour. Krista was extremely easy to work with for selecting our song choices, including a custom request that she learned and played perfectly as my wife walked down the aisle. Every small detail we asked for, she incorporated into the ceremony musicality. She was extremely professional with her arrival time, outfit, and full setup of the harp - which by the way was a wonderful addition to the ceremony aesthetic. During cocktail hour, she continued to wow guests with her talent - and added a unique elegance to that part of our special day. I would highly suggest booking Krista for your wedding (or other event that may require a talented harpist), she truly delivered.

Krista is a must hire for your wedding! We were referred to Krista by our venue back in 2019 and we are so happy we hired her for our big day! Our wedding was originally scheduled ...

for 10/10/2020 and due to the pandemic, we had to push our reception to 2021. We took a break from planning due to the pandemic and we picked it back up in the beginning of 2021 and she didn’t miss a beat. Krista’s music was beautiful, we received so many compliments for our ceremony music! She was also extremely professional and was always available to answer any questions or concerns. Thank you, Krista, for everything, we really appreciate it!

ortantly, her playing is top shelf. Checking out her website gives you an idea of her repertoire, which includes anything from classical to contemporary pop.

e let us tell her exactly which ones to play! Krista even learned a new song for us, which was amazing. She is so talented and provided us with a beautiful, serene ambiance that had everyone praising afterward. There was one song we had to nix during the ceremony to make it run more smoothly, which saddened us a little, but Krista surprised us by playing it as we re-entered the chapel post-recessional for the family photos! Super talented, super easy to communicate with, so nice and professional...what more could you want in a musician? I highly recommend Krista for any occasion!

isten to. :) She was incredibly easy to communicate with leading up to the wedding. She also has such a wide range of music. We basically told her we thought we may enjoy some contemporary pieces and left the music playing in her hands. I met her quickly when she arrived at the venue, and sadly wasn't able to talk much in person because I was getting ready, but had a calm and sweet aura. She played Harvest Moon as I walked down the aisle, a piece I had requested quick last minute. She said no problem! She left partway through our cocktail hour, and it was a smooth transition. Thank you Krista for being one of the various vendors who made the wedding planning experience stress and fuss free. We truly enjoyed your music and your presence.

formance went above and beyond my expectations. When I heard her play I felt like I was in a dream! We wanted the beautiful, tranquil sounds of the harp, but playing modern and non-traditional songs for the processional and recessional - Fleetwood Mac and The Beatles. The result was absolutely amazing. Krista was so easy to work with throughout the entire planning process, and she accommodated every request. She was so graceful and talented, and the concert harp is so impressive, it really added something unique to our big day. I can't thank Krista enough for her amazing performance and highly recommend working with her!
