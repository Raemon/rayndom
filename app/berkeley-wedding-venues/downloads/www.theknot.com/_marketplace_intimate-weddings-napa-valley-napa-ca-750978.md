There are not enough stars that we can leave for the amazing job that Sonja did for us. She was on top of every single detail. She kept everything nice and organized. I'm sure ther...

e were "issues" the day of the wedding, but I never knew about them because Sonja made sure that everything was perfect and if an issue arose, she handled it without us ever knowing about it. Our day was magical and all the detailed communication with Sonja took away our stress as we were planning our wedding from across the country. She made vendor recommendations to us, but ultimately it was our choice who we chose. Once we selected the vendor, she handled everything! She set up all the meetings. She dealt with the vendors directly. There is not a single detail that she did not consider. To watch her work on the days leading up to the wedding was remarkable. Her organization of all the vendors, the detailed schedule, and the coordination of all deliveries was like a symphony. Please look no further when planning the biggest day of your life. Sonja shared in our joy and she stood with us every step of the way. I would not change one single thing about our wedding day!!!
