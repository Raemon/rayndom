Not only do these red carpet mainstays work for [the Hollywood elite](https://www.theknot.com/content/famous-couples), but they're also a great idea for a reception photo op that allows guests to easily snap pics on their phones in addition to whatever setup [the photo booth rental company](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/wedding-photo-booth-rentals) has provided.

[At this chic outdoor wedding](https://www.theknot.com/real-weddings/a-chic-themed-wedding-at-lauberge-del-mar-in-del-mar-california-album), the couple's dramatic photo booth backdrop was a raspberry-hued quilt. The pattern even matched the adornments on their wedding cake.

_[Stetten Wilson](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/stetten-wilson-los-angeles-ca-1009237)_




A backdrop doesn't have to be over-the-top––it simply needs to create a uniform setting in front of which guests can capture photos. We love the hushed tones of the backdrop next to the vibrant orange flower arrangement because it gives cool contrast for pictures.

### 3\. Iridescent Photo Booth Backdrop

## Wedding Photo Booth Tips

Before you find inspiration from all the wedding photo booth ideas below, you need to know how to successfully pull off your own photo booth. Check out these tips from [wedding pros](https://www.theknot.com/content/ones-to-watch) so you capture your special day the right way.

### Allow ample space in the floor plan.

Because of the large footprint that photo booths require, don't wait until the last minute of wedding planning to figure out how you'll work the wedding photography setup into your layout. "Photo booths are a great opportunity to capture some fun moments at your reception. Of course, they can serve as your [party favors](https://www.theknot.com/content/best-wedding-favor-ideas) too, which is always a perk! They do, however, take up a good deal of space," notes [Laura Maddox](https://www.magnoliacelebrates.com/), planning expert and owner of [Magnolia Celebrates](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/magnolia-celebrates-roswell-ga-304626), with over 15 years of experience in the hospitality industry.

### Include festive props.

Beyond the actual setup, it's a great idea to include some creative props that guests can pose with that goes with the photo booth wedding design. "Bringing props that speak to the couple is always fun," says Nora Sheils, wedding planner expert and co-founder of [Rock Paper Coin](https://www.rockpapercoin.com/) and founder of [Bridal Bliss](https://www.bridalbliss.com/). "Items like paraphernalia from your alma mater(s), childhood favorites, destinations you've traveled to together or something significant to where you were engaged are great ways to personalize the event."

### Take your guest list demographics into account.

Wedding reception photo booths are a great addition where some older guests are in attendance. While many people are dancing, it's nice to have [an alternative form of entertainment](https://www.theknot.com/content/secrets-to-a-fun-wedding-reception) for those who don't want to break it down on the [dance floor](https://www.theknot.com/content/12-ways-to-customize-your-dance-floor) with your wedding party. Sheils explains, "Additional entertainment at a wedding reception is always a plus. Those who aren't drinkers or dancers always appreciate another activity to participate in."

### Keep your wedding photographer and photo booth vendor separate.

Even though it's possible to find a wedding photographer who offers a photo booth add-on, it's best to find a company specializing in photo booths. [Jamie Chang](https://www.mangomuseevents.com/), owner and destination wedding planner at [Mango Muse Events](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/mango-muse-events-los-altos-ca-748027) with over 14 years of experience planning weddings, explains why. "A photographer can do a photo booth, but that's not their focus. Choosing a photo booth company means they're good at photo booths specifically. And because of that, they'll also have more options and customizations they'll be able to do to make your photo booth fun and unique." This is the best way to ensure your photographer's attention is 100% on snapping beautiful pictures of the night.

### Think outside the box.

Beyond standard photo booths that create a strip of photos, unique high-quality photo booth concepts, like gif and video booths, have become a hit [wedding photography trend](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-photography-trends) in recent years. If pricing permits, Maddox encourages to-be-weds to find a "360-degree booth. These are a fun new option that captures your guests from every angle. It will be a new and upscale experience for your guests. These also often take up a great deal of space, so make sure you've planned an area according to the contract's required footprint."
