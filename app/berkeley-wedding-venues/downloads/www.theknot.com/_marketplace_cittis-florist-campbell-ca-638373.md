Citti's Florist is a longtime favorite for affordable weddings and special events, serving some families for three generations. The reviews consistently highlight personalized service, beautiful design, and attention to detail for over 60 years. Citti's, a family business still today, was established in 1962 by a woman, Gloria Della Maggiore Citti, along with her husband, Fedele Citti. They were both first-generation Americans, born of Italian immigrant parents, making their way in Santa Clara Valley. From their beginnings, the Citti family emphasized a guiding philosophy: delivering quality products, creative floral design, and outstanding customer service. The Citti family worked hard, gave a lot of time and charity to the people of Santa Clara Valley, and established Citti's Florist as a regional leader that ranks among the top 100 out of over 25,000 U.S. florists, while gaining wonderful customers who have been loyal for many generations. The florist has garnered local prestige, including being voted "Best of the Best" by the San Jose Mercury News many times over the past couple of decades. Citti's features a wide selection of flowers, plants, and gifts with nationwide and international delivery. In the words of its 92-year-old founder, Gloria Citti, "Our goal as the Citti Florist Family… is to offer outstanding professional service with a quality product and superior design. This has been our philosophy for over 60 years. We are a family business built on service." Citti's Florist is a long-established professional wedding floral company in Campbell, CA.

I cannot say enough amazing things about Citti’s Florist! They did the flowers for my wedding, and everything was absolutely breathtaking. The arrangements completely exceeded my e...

xpectations — every bouquet, centerpiece, alter and floral detail was more beautiful than I could have imagined. Working with Chris and Adrianna was such a smooth and enjoyable process. They really took the time to listen to my vision and made it come to life effortlessly. They were kind, professional, and so easy to work with throughout the entire planning process. When I saw the venue all set up, I was blown away — the flowers completely elevated the space and tied everything together so perfectly. I received so many compliments from guests, and I still smile every time I look at the photos. Thank you to the entire Citti’s Florist team for making our day so incredibly special and stunning. You truly went above and beyond!

r options. The delivery was on time and there were no hitches along the way (except for my husband and I getting hitched...bah dum bum). :) The flowers we received were absolutely gorgeous and the colors were incredible. The flowers held up throughout the entire day and continued to make us smile the week after the wedding. I was so sad when they finally all died! I would absolutely use Citti's again and am so grateful to them for helping to make our special day really beautiful.

I lagged on flowers- they were just not very important to me. They took my order less than 2 weeks out and got the color (coral) perfect!! I was very impressed!
