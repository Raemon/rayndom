In fact, couples regularly tell me our lessons were the best part of their wedding preparations—and a highlight of their big day! Whether you want something traditional or offbeat, formal or casual, simple or fully choreographed, I'll help craft a first dance custom-tailored to you and your song. So get ready to have FUN, strut your stuff, impress your guests and have great photos to show for it—plus dance skills you can use the rest of your lives!

le process enjoyable, especially for my husband, who was a little nervous at first. She made us both feel comfortable and confident, breaking everything down in a way that was easy to follow and so much fun. Brandee’s patience, positivity, and expertise truly stood out—she’s the best! Our first dance ended up being one of our favorite moments of the day, and we owe so much of that to her. We’re so grateful for the time and care she put into helping us create something so special. If you’re looking for a dance instructor who is kind, talented, and an absolute joy to work with, Brandee is the one!

randee was incredibly easy to work with, always responsive, and communicated every step of the way. She really took the time to understand the vibe we were going for and made sure the choreography was something we both felt comfortable with. What impressed us the most was how she made learning to dance so enjoyable. My now husband isn’t much of a dancer, but Brandee’s patience, encouragement, and easy-to-follow guidance helped him relax and have fun with it. By the end of our lessons, he was actually excited about dancing! He even mentioned that he’d be open to taking more dance classes with me in the future—something I never thought I’d hear him say! Our first dance turned out beautifully, and we couldn’t have asked for a better instructor to guide us through it. Thank you, Brandee, for making this such a memorable part of our wedding journey. We’re so grateful for your expertise, kindness, and the fun experience you created for us!

irst dance at our wedding. I went in to the first lesson a bit nervous, but Brandee was so warm and made us feel instantly at ease. We didn't really know what we wanted coming in ("simple dance with some fun elements" to a certain song) and she helped choreograph something perfect for us while also giving us lots of opportunities to provide input. Brandee is great at explaining and demonstrating moves and is so patient, constructive and positive. As an introvert who was previously dreading the first dance, Brandee made me feel comfortable and confident and I had so much fun on the actual wedding day. In our last couple sessions I mentioned wanting to also learn a little salsa and merengue, and Brandee was super flexible in switching gears and teaching us a few basics. So much fun! I hope to take lessons with Brandee again in the future- she's such a joy to work with.

ly not practiced dancers, so we decided to do some lessons with Brandee. I'm so happy we made that decision! Brandee is the type of instructor who makes you feel immediately at ease with her patience, humor, and skill. She'll help you design a dance that fits your goals, comfort level, and style and help you feel confident and prepared during what can be a nerve wracking moment! Plus, the lessons were just a fun experience to have with loved ones before a very special day.

Brandee has the unique ability to meet each person where they are in terms of skill and confidence, and she guided us as a couple to feel great about our dance. She teaches with patience, support, and humor, which we found to be essential. Book her now!

ingful to us. I searched around and contacted multiple dance instructors and chose Brandee because of her professionalism and prompt response. She also appeared welcoming and genuine through our limited interactions. Brandee was great throughout our 5 lessons. She was very encouraging and patient and broke down every step and detail as needed. In the end we had our moves down and were ready for the big day. Our first dance went without a hitch and we are so happy we had the help of Brandee! I highly recommend her services to anyone looking for dance instructions.

elp - SO many enthusiastic reviews - and she got back to us immediately. We did a five lesson package and Brandee took us from clueless to confident. She is warm, encouraging, fun, and a great teacher. Each one hour lesson flew by. By the time our wedding rolled around, the first dance was no longer something we were afraid of - we were able to have fun and actually enjoyed being the center of attention. We love Brandee and can't recommend her enough!

Along with the realization of having to dance in front of guests at our reception came the panic and anxiety about the whole thing. Queue the frantic Google searching for a dance ...

instructor in the Bay Area! I quickly stumbled upon Brandee Selck. Just a quick read of all the positive testimonials on her website assured me this was the dance instructor for us! After an initial inquiry detailing our need for first dance help, Brandee got back to us quickly and we set up our first lesson. She took the time to listen to what we had in mind then tailored our lessons accordingly. Our song choice for the first dance was a tad unconventional as it was a folksy punk song but somehow Brandee came up with a super fun dance that went so well with the song! Brandee is such a patient teacher. She truly has a skill for helping beginners master new dance moves. Another great touch to Brandee's lessons are how she greets you warmly at the beginning of each class. As I'm sure all brides and grooms can relate, there's a lot going on in preparation for your wedding and so many mental to do lists swimming around in your brain that one is most certainly not at their most relaxed state during this time. Starting a lesson with that type of warm welcome really sets you up for a fun, stress free hour of dancing. It's the little things like that, that I truly appreciated during the wedding planning process. After a handful of classes, we felt ready for our first dance. Not only was I not even the least bit nervous about dancing in front of people, I was actually excited about showing off our new moves to one of our favorite songs. I can't recommend Brandee enough for all your first dance needs!
