The first time I met Roberta was on a roof top party in San Francisco. We started talking and getting to know each other and I said I wish there was some music and then she started...

singing in my ear, just her voice with no instrument or band or background music and I was wowed her voice was insane, so soft and deep, I was blown away. Then shortly everyone at the party heard her and not much longer she got the name as the best singer in the neighborhood and that’s how we became friends. And as well because of her amazing charismatic energy.

I have never seen a singer with a presence of spirit like Roberta. She is brilliant. When she sings all the party moves and everybody starts to dance and she can do all kinds of so...

ngs. She sings romance, pop, jazz... whatever you want. When she sang atvtge wedding of one of my best friends all the bridesmaids cried, because her voice is sweat and she was able to show the love of the couple through the music. She is amazing
