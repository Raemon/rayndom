The Groove Doctors were amazing!! Jane was wonderful to work with during the planning process. They're experts at knowing wedding crowds but were open to our input of what we did/d...

idn't want played. They also did a wonderful job emceeing (sticking to the timeline that I shared but checking in with me in real time in case we needed to adjust anything), and playing songs for things like our entrance and cake cutting. They kept the dance floor packed all night and so many guests commented on how much they enjoyed the band! Can't recommend them enough.
