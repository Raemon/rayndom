All we can say is WOW! Chef was the chef for our 100 person wedding at Arista Winery last weekend and we cannot say enough good things about the experience. He was professional to ...

work with throughout, and he was very conscious of our budget and made sure he stayed within it, which we really appreciated. We worked together to design the menu and he was open to listening to our requests for different food items than he had originally proposed. We went with all of his recommendations except we decided to switch to a burrata salad for the first course and it was absolutely divine. Chef's entire team (Chef, 10 servers, a sous-chef, 3 bartenders, an event coordinator, and a few more) were a pure joy to interact with. Everyone was so professional. We'd recommend chef a million times over. Thank you so much Chef!

With our 3rd wedding date, we found Chef Adair a month before our wedding! We didn't have a tasting with him prior but had heard nothing but great things from our wedding planner, ...

CMG Events. Before our wedding Chef Adair had us choose a selection of meals from his menus that we wanted to try - then he put together a special menu for us based on what is in season and that appealed to our palate! Chef Adair was open to feedback and ultimately he created the best 5 course meal we could have ever had! During our wedding dinner, he came out and introduced each course and gave us a background on how it was cooked. Everything was absolutely delicious!!! Chef Adair not only did our wedding dinner, but also our rehearsal dinner, cocktail hour, breakfast and lunch for the day. Highly recommend!!!!
