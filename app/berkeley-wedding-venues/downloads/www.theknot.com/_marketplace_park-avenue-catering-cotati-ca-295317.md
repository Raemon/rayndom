If you’re reading this review and considering hiring Park Avenue Catering for your wedding or special event, just DO IT! We hired them for our ~110 guest wedding and they did a fla...

wless job executing our vision. When planning our wedding, we wanted to have 3-4 stations that highlighted our favorite foods from around the globe and when we first spoke with Anthony, he immediately got our vision and worked with us to prepare an initial menu. When we arrived for our tasting it was clear that Park Ave got our vision and had the culinary skills to execute on it. As we approached our wedding day, the Park Avenue team were easy to work with as we finalized the details and coordinated on ancillary items like welcome drinks and table settings. On the wedding day, the Park Ave team were absolute pros, pulling together delicious dishes for our Japanese, Indian and Brazilian inspired stations that had our guests going up for seconds and thirds. They also executed an incredible cocktail hour spread including dumplings, tacos, and a mezze board, as well as the most delicious desserts and coffee spread. We wanted to give our guests a memorable meal and Park Avenue absolutely delivered on that. One of our pickiest guests, a professional chef, said it was “the best wedding food” he’s ever had (he’s still talking about the cocktail hour dumplings, dolmas, and the miso eggplant at dinner). Park Ave was also able to accommodate our many guests’ dietary restrictions - their veggie/vegan options were actually so good that much of our menu ended up being plant-based (ask them about the jackfruit carnitas tacos in particular). We would highly recommend Park Avenue!

We had Park Avenue Catering for our wedding for both food and bar, and everything was top notch. Their food was genuinely the best that we've ever had at a wedding, and so many of ...

our guests told us the same, praising especially their chanterelle mushroom pasta. We decided to serve our food family style, and our guests loved that that approach because it allowed them to bond with others at their table. The cocktails were also incredible and thoughtfully presented with beautiful garnishes. They were open to any of our ideas as to our signature cocktails, and they executed them perfectly. Sharon was a pleasure to work with and very receptive to our feedback on the food during our testing to make sure that we loved everything we served on our special day. The staff were also incredible, courteous, and efficient. Nothing could have been better. Although they had to make food on a hot summer day for 160 people at once, all of the food tasted as good and as fresh as if it were a dinner for two at a top restaurant. Thank you so much to Sharon and Park Avenue Catering!

We had the pleasure of working with Anthony and the Park Ave team for our wedding in April 2025. When deciding on what was most important to us during our wedding planning, we both...

agreed that a memorable dinner was at the top of our list. Anthony & Park Ave team not only delivered on creating the most memorable dinner for us on our wedding day, but also a lasting impression on our guests, who still to this day will tell me that our wedding buffet was the best they've ever had at any wedding. From the moment we met with Anthony, we knew we were in good hands. He was attentive to our needs, from dietary restrictions to the little things that we had asked to be changed during our tasting to fit our personal palettes and constantly answering our many questions via email. At no point did we ever feel pressured to add more or add any extra from him, it was all very much well advised by Anthony and our own decisions in the end were made with his expert knowledge in mind. Not only was Anthony fantastic in communicating prior to our wedding, but his staff was above and beyond amazing on the day of our wedding. We're always told that the bride and groom never gets to eat, but the Park Ave team was attentive to us and ensured we received a plate of everything from our buffet, including a plate of hors d'oeuvres in our bridal suite (their portobello fries are amazing). We really cannot recommend Anthony and the Park Ave team enough, they really are the best catering team out there and we are so so lucky to have been able to work with them. Our wedding was so memorable because of them, we wish we could relive our wedding dinner by Park Ave every year :) We hope we have another opportunity to work with them again and will continue to recommend them to our peers any chance we get!

I am absolutely delighted to share how exceptional Park Avenue Catering was for our wedding on June 20th, 2024. From the very beginning, our experience with them was nothing short ...

of fantastic, and the food was truly a highlight of our special day. A special thank you to our representative, Anthony, whose expertise and dedication made all the difference. Anthony’s attention to detail and personalized service ensured that our vision for the catering was brought to life perfectly. He worked closely with us to create a menu that was not only delicious but also vibrant and unique. The food and beverages on our wedding day were a visual and culinary delight. Each dish was presented with stunning colors and creativity, and the flavors were out of this world. Our guests were thrilled with the variety and quality of the offerings, and many commented on how memorable the meal was. The professionalism and warmth of the Park Avenue Catering team, combined with Anthony’s exceptional coordination, contributed to an unforgettable dining experience. If you’re searching for catering that will make your event extraordinary, I highly recommend Park Avenue Catering. They truly made our wedding day special with their remarkable food and service!

We had our wedding in May 2024 catered by Park Ave and it was AMAZING! We worked with Caitlin to build our menu, select our appetizers, coordinate our serving preferences, and stoc...

k/serve our entire bar. Caitlin guided us in selecting the preferences that mattered most to us, and fit in our budget. A few weeks before the wedding Caitlin even reached out and asked if we needed any kids meals - we did and the kids and parents were SO appreciative to have chicken nuggets and mac'n'cheese served at the wedding. Our wedding had 110 guests. We chose to serve Indian food. My husband eats meat, but I am a vegetarian so the Indian menu had the best vegetarian options while incorporating meat in a natural way. We originally chose lamb, but ended up selecting chicken because it was a little cheaper. All the Indian dishes were flavorful, perfectly cooked and so tasty!!!! We served our dinner family style and our guests loved it! They said all the food arrived at the same time, was perfectly hot, and the serving style was easy and swift and allowing guests to interact and meet each other as they passed dishes around to the table. We added hot chili oil to each table and it was perfect for our guests who wanted to add some spice. The servers were quick, personable, professional and so nice! They paid special attention to us as the bride and groom and the guests felt really taken care of by the serving staff. Overall book Park Ave if you want an easy and all inclusive caterer for your wedding!

azing. Each and every one of our guests said it was the best food they'd ever had at a wedding. From the start, Anthony set up a great tasting so that we could decide on menu items. He made suggestions based on the season and the vision we had for our wedding. He was extremely helpful in going over bar items I needed to get for the open bar since I didn't have a clue where to start! Leading up to the event, he was completely calm and responsive to all our last minute requests - including for plant based and gluten free dieters on our guest list. He and his team set aside some snacks and bubbly for me and my new husband immediately after the ceremony so we could have a brief moment alone and enjoy a few tastes before getting back to photos and guests. Our meal was served family style at each of the tables, but his staff made special plates just for my husband and I so we were sure to have a full plate of food. The staff was so attentive to all our guests, including our parents who had mobility issues, they would check on them to make sure they had everything they needed. At the end of the evening, they had packed a very special "picnic bag" with some leftovers, fruit, brownies and cake since as we all know, the bride and groom rarely get a chance to eat all they want. It really made my night! I literally didn't have to worry about a thing the whole day when it came to the food and beverages, I can't recommend Park Avenue Catering enough, you won't be disappointed!

y through the wedding night when we took home a reusable burlap bag with leftover meals, apples, brie, crackers, cream cheese brownies, cloth napkins, and a hand written note from Justine, the Business Development & Event Specialist. PAC came HIGHLY recommended by my wedding planner (she also used PAC when she got married) because she said the food was fantastic, the price was reasonable, and the service was so flawless she could "close her eyes at weddings with PAC and not worry about anything." Justine went above and beyond throughout the entire planning process, from providing recommendations in terms of meal selections (it was so hard to choose what to serve at the wedding because PAC has many, many delicious options) and table settings to creating custom changes to appetizers to ensure each appetizer was unique. Justine even attended the venue walkthrough with a number of other vendors a few weeks prior to the wedding to be available for questions. PAC, as well as my wedding planner, ensured my now husband and I actually ate at our wedding, which I didn't expect. The butternut squash ravioli was particularly heavenly and so many guests raved about the food (I especially loved the summer champagne salad too!). In addition to a small cake baked by a local baker, we elected to have a small assortment of desserts which were incredible - a S'mores-esque tart, a miniature banana eclair, and a key lime pie square. I hope I have an excuse to hire PAC again soon for another event, and Justine is such an amazingly sweet and talented event leader. I don't have any photos of the actual meals yet (we only have our sneak peak photos from our wedding) but I included a photo inside of our reception reception tent and I included our menu below because I loved it so much!

y of food and service at the event this last weekend. We did family style dinner at each table (18 tables) and at every table we heard from guests that they thought the food was 10/10. The caprese was beautiful, flank steak perfectly medium rare, the hand made ravioli melted at bite, I could keep going on. Our guests loved the bartenders and servers complimenting how friendly and helpful they were. We used the gelato cart for dessert and the ice cream was devoured immediately even though it was cold out that's how great it was! If I were ever planning a large event again I would absolutely use Park Ave they were A+ and I couldn't recommend them more!

responsive and personable throughout our planning process. She was flexible and understanding with us as we planned our wedding long-distance from the East Coast and helped me set up a tasting during a brief period of time I would be in town. The food was delicious and we received great feedback and compliments from our guests. Particular favorites were the fattoush salad, salmon with black olives, smashed potatoes, and passionfruit bars. Everything was set up and removed efficiently. The event captain, Marc, checked in with me from time to time to make sure that I was eating and that I was hydrated (thanks, Marc!). I would definitely recommend Park Avenue as a caterer for a North Bay Area wedding or any other event!

I never stopped being impressed by the value, quality, and professionalism of the Park Avenue team. Catering was probably our most important vendor and we knew we wanted great food...

and drinks more than anything else at our wedding, but we also expected a challenge finding a fantastic caterer who could provide restaurant quality food at our backyard/estate wedding Park Avenue came through in so many ways. Not only was the food SOOOO good (we got so many compliments on it), but they also were able to provide us with serving staff, bartenders, glassware, and silverware as part of our contract AND serve food from a kitchen setup on site. It was so much peace of mind to know they had it all under control. From our first call with Anthony, we thought it was too good to be true. And then we had our tasting, and they threw in an extra appetizer based on our favorite meal, and we couldn't believe that a caterer this great could exist. We weren't afraid to splurge on the caterer, but we didn't even have to! 10/10!

nd our way to PAC! Justine was an angel from our very first call. As long as I live, I will never forget when I apologized for asking so many questions and she sweetly and genuinely said, "Don't apologize! This is your first wedding, but this is my job. I'm here to help you." From then on, she made everything so easy! I had no clue your caterer handled all of your rentals, but when I tell you PAC does the heavy lifting, I mean it! The way Justine, our wedding coordinator and our venue worked together was absolutely insane! They know each other like the back of their hands and didn't miss one single detail. Justine even stopped in as were taking pre wedding photos to check in with her team and wish us well! She is a detail queen and such a kind human. All of that is just about the service, but the food was also insanely good, like, people still raving 5 days later good! We served dinner family style and everything was hot, perfectly seasoned and in wildly generous portions! We could not have been more pleased! The PAC team always made sure my husband and I had what we needed before we even thought to ask! As if all of that wasn't enough, reveling in our (exhausted) post wedding high in our hotel room, we found a bag from PAC with two boxed entrees, wedding cake, apples, cookies and a handwritten note from Justine thanking us for working with them! Above and beyond is the name of the game with PAC and we couldn't recommend them more highly!

When we did the tasting, we knew the food was delicious, but we expected a slight decline night-of the wedding due to the volume, etc. But it was just as amazing. Multiple people gave feedback that it was a highlight of the night and was by far the best food they've had at a wedding. Most people say that the bride and groom don't really eat during their own weddings, but my husband and I made it a priority to sit and enjoy the entree. I'd highly recommend Park Ave. Catering to anyone in the area. You won't be disappointed!

The process was seamless and the apps, dinner, bartenders and staff was superb. At one point, I realized there was someone holding an appetizer plate next to me during cocktail hour - she let me know that she’d been told to make sure the bride ate. How sweet and thoughtful! The spread was not only delicious, it was also stunning. We’re still drooling thinking about it. Thank you to the entire team for making our day perfect!

If you want your guests to rave about your wedding food, go with Park Ave Catering! I had people texting me after asking for the salad recipe! Caitlin was our main point of contact...

and she was amazing at answering our questions. During the tasting she pointed out anything that could be swapped to fit any dietary needs and was super helpful with picking out the linens and any other rental needs. The staff the day of the wedding hit it out of the park when it came to the quality of the food and service! The food was so delicious that we actually forgot to get up and make the rounds at the guest tables. The staff made us a special plate too so we wouldn’t need to reach across the table as we went with family style. The bar staff was also amazing and kept up with the demand! We could not be more pleased to have chosen Park Ave Catering to cater our wedding at Vine Hill House!

We cannot recommend Park Avenue Catering more highly. The food served at our wedding was exquisite, and multiple guests have told us it was the best wedding meal they’ve ever eaten...

. Honestly I wish they also had a restaurant because I would love to eat that meal over and over again! Some of the standout items on our menu were the duck confit tostadas, tartar tostadas, arugula and grilled peach salad, roasted cauliflower steak with olive salsa, Moroccan lemon chicken, lemon pepper rub tri-tip, potato-leek terrine, grilled vegetables, summer berry cobbler, and creme brulee. We decided to serve our meal family style so everyone could try a bit of everything, and in addition to being extraordinarily delicious there was a TON of food and no guest went hungry. Sharon, PAC’s wedding designer, helped us ensure that every guest with dietary restrictions was accommodated by our menu, and even arranged for a separate meal for someone with severe allergies. Her support throughout the planning process was exceptional, and I’m so grateful for her responsiveness and patience as she answered my lengthy lists of questions. She also helped us coordinate with our venue and planner and managed all our rentals through Encore (though PAC generously included plates, flatware, and our dessert/coffee ceramics for free). She was a great communicator and flexible, and helped us update our table rentals last minute after a few guests had to drop out due to COVID. The service on our wedding day was also impeccable–from the bartending and wait staff to the kitchen crew. Together they ensured that everything was on time and each guest was taken care of. The event manager Mark surprised us with special touches - greeting us and our wedding party with prosecco and appetizers after we processed out of our ceremony, and sending us home with a picnic basket with our wedding dinner for two. I truly don’t think working with PAC could have been a better experience. On top of everything, they use local products and compost all their food waste! I would absolutely book them again.

Park Avenue Catering provided catering for our wedding in Sonoma, CA in April 2022. We could not recommend them more highly and were particularly impressed with all the attention t...

o detail they provided on our special day. We worked with Anthony and he made the entire process so smooth and seamless, especially as we wanted to incorporate some special requests and cultural elements into our menu (Chinese street food snacks for our hors d'oeuvres). We also had such an amazing time at our tasting, and Anthony was able to accommodate our requests/thoughts after we tasted our menu. On the actual wedding day, the team set aside our hors d'oeuvres just for us in case we would miss any food during our cocktail hour. During dinner service, the staff were extremely attentive in making sure we had time to enjoy our meals and that our guests were happy. At the end of the night, the team went above and beyond and provided boxed portions of all of our food (plus some extra special treats) for us to enjoy after the fun and festivities of the day. We are still (2 months post wedding) hearing from our guests about how good the food was and that it was some of the best wedding food they've ever had! We were totally blown away by the thoughtfulness of all of this and all the care the team put into our wedding day. Thank you Park Ave. Catering and Anthony for an incredible experience!

Park Avenue was OUTSTANDING catering our wedding at Vine Hill House in June 2022. The event could not have gone better!! All of their team members were professional and friendly, ...

and helped everyone "feel at home". The two bartenders in particular were outstanding. The food somehow was even better than at our tastings, and had the "wow" factor that blew away even our foody-est guests. We have to mention two people specifically: Caitlin and Marc. Caitlin was just the nicest and most helpful person imaginable!! We had a TON of questions which she handled with grace and ease. She really listened to what we were aiming for, and made suggestions on things that she thought might help make things even better...and we always felt these suggestions were purely for us, never "upsells" or anything like that. Her advice and knowledge helped take a few of our thoughts from "good" to "great", and we will always be appreciative of all she did to help make our wedding so special...and make the planning as easy as possible. On the day of our ceremony/reception, Marc (the crew "captain" I believe) was a complete rock star! He had everything going like clockwork, and was patient with the few (stupid) questions that I did have. The wait staff and bartenders all interacted with each other and our guests seamlessly, which I suspect is a reflection on Marc's leadership. Even at the end of the night when we were exhausted, he still had a smile and went out of his way to help us at every opportunity. A huge thanks again to all the Park Avenue team for making our wedding more special than we ever hoped it would be!!

thony was a pleasure to work with, helped us build the perfect menu, and was happy to accommodate last minute changes. Anthony also saved us ~$1,000 in delivery fees by including chairs, linens, and some other items on their rental order, which saved us needing to place a separate one. At the wedding, the food was spectacular (we received many compliments from guests) and the service staff was professional. They even sent us home with a to go bag so we could enjoy leftovers the next day and try all of the desserts that we didn't get the chance to during the wedding! If you want to not have to worry about having amazing food, book Park Ave. ASAP

Park Avenue was the caterer for our wedding in October 2021. The food was AMAZING and the service was exceptional. Our wedding was in a remote location at a private venue and Park ...

Avenue worked with us to ensure the venue layout worked for both the guests and the catering team. We heard such positive feedback from our guests about how much they loved the food, how friendly the servers were, and how they enjoyed the meal being served “family style.” As the bride & groom, we had a specific person dedicated to serving us. I got to try all the appetizers and drinks. I was so full I couldn’t finish my main course (even though I wanted to because it was so delicious). Park Avenue sent us home with “to-go” boxes of food, food, and crackers, which was very thoughtful. I would highly recommend Park Avenue!

Truly I cannot imagine a better experience working with a catering company for your wedding. On top of the absolutely superb customer service, their food is phenomenal and their setups are beautiful. We got so many compliments from our guests that it was the best wedding food they'd ever had. I cannot recommend them enough — just choose Park Ave and make your life easy!

We loved working with Park Avenue Catering for our wedding. As a wedding planner in another state, I was highly impressed with their level of service. We worked with Janine through...

out the planning process, and she was always prompt when answering emails. We truly felt like she listened to our likes and dislikes and helped direct us to menu items that would fit with our vision. When we had to schedule our menu tasting on short notice, Janine was so accommodating to make sure we could have that experience. Their food at our wedding was incredible, and we were very pleased with their service staff. They took great care of us as the bride and groom on our wedding day--they even prepared a plate of appetizers for us to eat directly after the ceremony. We would happily hire Park Avenue Catering for another event!

t twice due to Covid. Caitlin was the most helpful, calming, professional person and she made the process incredibly seamless. We literally could not have had our wedding without her! She has such valuable experience and expertise, and it is extremely clear that she loves her job. She not only helped us with our food and dining selections, but she also helped us with table/chair, heater, lighting, etc rentals, which was extremely helpful. The food at our wedding was absolutely incredible, and our guests are still raving about it. PAC really allows you to customize your menu to exactly what you want, making the process and the food very personal, which is what a wedding is about. We absolutely recommend PAC and Caitlin for your wedding! If Caitlin is involved, it will no doubt be a flawless and beautiful event!

Before choosing PAC, we had attended two weddings in the Sonoma/Napa area catered by them, and it was the most delicious, best presented food we'd ever had at a wedding. Before we ...

even knew our venue, we knew we wanted PAC to cater our special day. Our tasting was so much fun, and we were so stuffed when we left. It was like having a tasting menu at a Michelin-star restaurant but with more food, so prepare yourself for a great time (we'd recommend making a romantic long weekend out of it). We had to reschedule with PAC not once, but twice, the first time because our venue canceled on us, and the second because of COVID. Both times they were understanding and were quick to respond with other available dates so we could make sure they could still cater the event for our new date. Day of, Caitlin was amazing to work with. I went through my last-minute concerns with her and anything I had thought of, she already had under control. Food and drinks came quickly for us and our guests so people could enjoy each other's company and not worry about waiting in line for anything. The bartenders and serving staff were so friendly and capable. They were also great at special touches for us (the couple) like having red, white, and sparkling wine at our place setting so we had whatever we wanted with dinner and toasts without having to wait. The food was just as delicious at the event as it was at our tasting. For hors d'oeuvres we did pea tarts, blue cheese shortbreads, bacon-wrapped dates, and pork belly bao buns, of which the bacon-wrapped dates and bao buns went most quickly. For plated salad we did local summer greens with pistachios, pomegranate, and jalapeno dressing, which tasted so fresh. For mains, the leg of lamb and fontinella ravioli with wild mushrooms were the stand-out favorites. We also did chicken and waffles as a late-night snack, which was the perfect bite to accompany all the drinking and dancing. Our guests raved about how much they enjoyed the food, and we've also been enjoying the leftovers! I will definitely look for excuses to have PAC cater a micro-event for us in the near future!

as excited about the menu and Justine was really sweet helping make sure that everyone was enjoying everything - including my mom who was undergoing chemo at the time and not feeling great. Their location in Cotati is convenient and the tasting could not have gone more smoothly. For planning overall, Justine was so wonderful and communicative. I come from an events background and had about a million questions and there was never one that she couldn't answer almost immediately - even once we got into dreaded Covid period and we were still determining if and how we'd be able to move forward and waiting on California/Sonoma guidelines for service. Our wedding was extremely impacted by Covid so we went from 110 guests to planning a super small and private, family-only dinner for 13 people and they were amazing every step of the way. At one point Justine had helped me create 3 different versions of our BEO that included different types of service/menus/rentals based on whether we felt comfortable having dinner served onsite, if we were going to do al fresco and have it dropped off earlier, etc. It was a nightmare and she was awesome. When the day finally arrived the team was prompt, food was delicious, they were very aware of all Covid requirements to ensure that things went smoothly and safely. LOVE Park Ave and would 100% recommend them to anyone.

Park Ave catering came to us highly recommended and they were amazing. Anthony worked with me on the entire planning phase and he was so helpful and responsive – it was a treat to ...

have someone as competent as him handling our most expensive and impactful vendor. Food choices were awesome – very California style food with lots of veggies, great fresh ingredients, little to no sauce, just lots of olive oil salt pepper and great tasty food. The tasting experience was a private meal for us and our parents and was a great chance to try the food, make small changes, and feel confident. During the wedding, they killed it at cocktail hour, serving incredibly tasty items like raw scallops and arancini. There was a lot of food and all our guests got to try the passed apps – we hate it when we attend weddings where we have to fight for the sparse and crappy passed apps, but this was nothing like that. One of our friends said she had about 5 scallops, to put it in context. The wedding meal was incredible too. We had panzanella salad, grilled seasonal veggies, roasted fish, baked chicken thighs, farro salad, and tons of other tasty items. It was incredible, and there was enough food at every table so that nobody went hungry. So many guests told us it was the best wedding food we’ve ever had, and I know I’m biased because it was my own wedding but I have to agree. We also did dessert through Park Ave and it was incredible as well. Seriously, I can’t recommend Anthony and Park Ave enough, they did such an amazing job and made the food a HIGHLIGHT of our wedding, not just something to get the guests through the night.

We loved working with Anthony at Park Avenue Catering for our wedding at Cornerstone Sonoma and would highly recommend them to everyone! The Food: My now husband and I have very s...

pecific tastes and we're very opinionated about our food. Anthony really took the time to understand our tastes and even incorporated them into the menu. For example, we love yuzu flavored things, so he got the chef to create a yuzu beurre blanc to go with our miso cod and seasoned it with yuzu salt. We also changed out the base of a couple of our canepes and the vegetable flavorings. Our guests really loved the food and can't stop raving about it. The Service: I was very impressed by Park Avenue's catering staff - everyone was so professional, kind, and had a smile on their face. They also specifically seeked us out (as the bride and groom) to make sure we were fed in between all the wedding activities. You always hear how couples never eat at their weddings? Well, the staff made a great effort to put food and water in front of us whenever they saw we were free. I think that kind of service is hard to come by because catering has high turnover, but Park Avenue employs their staff full time! The bartenders that Park Avenue provided were also really great - they totally nailed our signature cocktails and handled our rowdy drunk friends with a lot of grace. We also loved that Park Avenue left us with to-go portions of our wedding dinner in an insulated bag with a handwritten card. It was literally the best morning after food we could have asked for and it was as delicious as on our wedding night.

Do yourself a favor and work with Park Avenue. All of their food is amazing. Not only at our own wedding, but at friends weddings who have hired them as well. We worked with Justin...

e and could not have been happier. She was always quick to respond to emails and very detailed. She helped us not only with the menu, but with all the little details of service you don’t think about. We were able to taste through our menu (arguably the best part) and offer up our opinion and critiques, of which there were few. As it typically goes with a wedding, we did not have a lot of time to sit and enjoy dinner. Thankfully, there was a much needed pizza and snacks waiting for us right after the ceremony and they even made us two to-go plates of the dinner we barely had a chance to taste to enjoy later (which we did). Thank you, Justine!

The bartenders and servers were very professional and our guests had a seamless and enjoyable experience. One area of improvement for PAC is making formal changes to the contract during the planning process where there were several occasions where note and comments were acknowledged, but not reflected, in contract form. Overall, still a good experience and we would recommend their services.

Park Avenue made our wedding memorable for us and our guests! The food was delicious and Sharon did a remarkable job of helping us design a menu that reflected our relationship and...

tastes. She is wonderfully nice, patient, and responsive. Since I did most of the wedding planning, the hubby did all the reviewing! Read his comments below: Wedding food is never memorable. The task of preparing several different dishes for 100’s of people; the expectation that each person eats at relatively the same time; requesting that everyone’s food is hot, that salads are crisp, and that gluten free peanut allergy vegans are all taken care of… All of this is an impossible ask. So, most often, wedding guests walk away saying- “The chicken wasn’t bad,” “The fish looked okay, but they ran out before I could taste it.” And, for the most part, this is all okay… we don’t attend (nor organize) weddings for the food. Because of this, I didn’t have high hopes for the food at my own wedding. I wanted it to be affordable, I wanted steak, and I wanted the decision made quickly. My fiance (now wife) however, the foody, had different ideas. She imagined hors d'oeuvres that represented our favorite travel destinations and SF restaurants (mango sticky rice, crispy pork belly, Peruvian ceviche, etc.). She wanted our guests to chase down the caterers for seconds; she wanted the food delicious, hot, exciting, and a topic of conversation. For the entrees, she wanted melt-in-your-mouth steak, delicate flavorful fish, and vegetarian options that wouldn’t feel like an afterthought. We got all of this and more with Sharon! Sharon worked with us to perfectly curtail a wacky / gourmet menu that reflected our love for food, our love for international fun, and our very special relationship. Over a month later, I am still regretting that I didn’t eat more at the wedding. And over a month later, friends and family are still bringing up how great the food was. I hope Sharon’s still in business 13 years from now, so she can cater our kid’s bar-mitzvah!
