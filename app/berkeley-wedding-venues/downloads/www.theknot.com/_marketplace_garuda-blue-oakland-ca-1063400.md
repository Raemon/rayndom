appen to do some jazz. Their communication leading up to the wedding was prompt, professional, and concise, which put us at ease throughout the entire planning process. On the day of, their performance was nothing short of exceptional - they played incredible jazz solos and during the dance party they got everyone dancing to top 40 hits. As top-tier jazz musicians with their own original arrangements, they truly elevated our wedding reception and made it a night to remember. We highly recommend Garuda Blue to any couple looking for the best in live music and entertainment for their special day.

s is the band for you. You can tell that these guys are real jazz musicians that have been playing with each other for a long time. I heard nothing but great music, sick solos, and plenty of praises from our friends and family. Jazz, R&B, Soul, Funk, Top 40s, you name it, and they will nail it. If you are looking for the BEST look no further! Thank you, Garuda Blue!!

Garuda Blue is made up of a group of very talented musicians, as a result their music is incredible! I am a wedding planner who has worked with Garuda Blue for over 4 years on many...

events together. We are always excited when we get to partner up on events, it's also a huge bonus to be able to enjoy their music too! Not only do they have a great jazz repertoire, they also do many modern and party hits that are sure to get the dance floor going. This is a common question we get a lot - whether or not a jazz party band works for the dancing portion of the evening. For Garuda Blue it's a big hands down yes! They can also help with ceremony and cocktail hour ambiance music by doing a smaller ensemble (like a duo or trio). Overall they are very communicative and easy to work with (so important with all the details and stress that comes with event planning). Everyone in this group is kind, hardworking, and passionate about what they do, which are important traits in this industry because it shows in the energy and music that is played. Thank you, Garuda Blue, and hope to partner up on the next party again soon!

us to book a group that could play some jazz, and Garuda Blue delivered to the max (you'll be hard pressed to find a more talented and versatile group...). On top of this, the band had zero difficulty transitioning from jazz into dance-floor hits, and they had the crowd dancing all night. Garuda Blue was fun for people of all ages, and they were worth every single penny. If you want a wedding band that'll do it all and make your day easy, look no further. Thanks so much to all of the guys for making our day so incredible!

Wow, Garuda Blue blew it out of the park at our wedding. This is no ordinary band; it is a musician's band. All the members of Garuda Blue are top notch jazz musicians and it shows...

in their playing. I never thought that a wedding band can be this good since I always assume that musicians of their caliber are too artsy and advanced to do weddings. Well, I was wrong! Garuda Blue is a HIDDEN GEM; you won't find anyone better out there. No need to look anywhere else, just book them already!

sband said he couldn't believe they got a bunch of Silicon Valley techies on the dance floor! We most recently had Abe (pianist) and Patrick (vocals) perform at our Catholic wedding ceremony and it was absolutely beautiful! They are extremely talented and are very knowledgeable when it comes to Catholic ceremonies. We cannot wait to have them perform at our larger reception post-COVID! I have no doubt they are going to be a hit. If you are deciding between a DJ or band, go with a band and go with Garuda Blue!

sionalism drew us to them and throughout the planning process Abe was hands on and accommodating to our requests. When we finally had them at our wedding they blew everyone away. They were super talented and their selections of jazz songs fit the mood perfectly. After the toasts they switched to more contemporary songs and had everyone up dancing for the rest of the night. We had nothing but compliments from our guests. Everyone kept talking about the band and how good they were! Thanks Garuda Blue for making it such a magical night.

Garuda Blue is the best! When we shopped around for wedding bands we knew we wanted something different, and we're so glad we hired these guys! Totally worth our investment. Duri...

ng our research we found many "bands" but in reality they're actually just agencies that put together different musicians for your wedding. So you'll end up with a "build your own" band at your wedding. What drew us to Garuda Blue was the fact that they're an actual band with their own sound and personality. These guys know each other way too well and it shows in their music. The level of musicianship in this band is through the roof, especially if you're a jazz fan like me. We went to one of their concerts and was totally blown away by how high the level of playing was. These guys got a great thing going and you won't be disappointed to have them at your wedding. We've since become fans and we'll be keeping up with them. Also they're honestly the nicest bunch of guys and great to hang around with. Totally book this band!
