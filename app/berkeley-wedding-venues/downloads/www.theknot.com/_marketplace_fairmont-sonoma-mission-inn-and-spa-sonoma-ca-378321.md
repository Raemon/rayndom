Highly highly highly recommend! My wife and I were married in June 2023 and after a lot of back and forth on venues a year prior, we settled on the Mission Inn (specifically the S...

onoma Golf Club) as our venue. The SMI team was absolutely incredible. Debbe was amazing during the beginning stages of getting us under contract. Tracy took us the rest of the way as our wedding coordinator - I couldn’t imagine working with anyone else for the year prior to the big day. Both Debbe and Tracy were phenomenal, I can’t say it enough. Between the welcome event we had at the Mission Inn and the actual wedding at the Sonoma Golf Club, the SMI team blew us away. The food was perfect and most importantly - served on time. Every detail was accounted for all weekend. This team is so incredibly competent at running an elegant wedding weekend, we were so impressed. Anyone that is considering a wine country wedding should consider a wedding at the Sonoma Mission Inn and/or the Sonoma Golf Club. Thank you again Tracy, Debbe, and the entire SMI team! My wife and I will forever be grateful and we can’t wait to come back and stay at the hotel for many years to come!

I cannot say enough amazing things about Tracy and the team at Fairmont Sonoma Mission Inn! Our wedding took place at the Sonoma Golf Club (part of their properties) on May 19th, a...

nd it was everything we could have dreamed of and more. We knew we wanted to get married in Sonoma, but found hurdles with winery venues that we didn't want to compromise on. The Sonoma Golf Club felt like it was our own estate for the day, with a variety of locations that created our perfect backdrop. Eating dinner outside on the lawn under twinkling lights was a highlight and felt so romantic and special. Food and beverage here is second to none - all of our guests told us the food was the best they've ever had at a wedding (and in general!). SMI worked with us to have a tasting to land on the perfect menu, and even collaborated with us to do fun unique touches like donuts and ice cream instead of cake. We were able to keep the night going until past 11 due to the fact that dancing took place indoors - such a highlight for us! The reception also had space for a variety of activities for those who didn't want to dance - the fire pit with s'mores station was a favorite of many of our guests! All in all, we highly recommend the Sonoma Mission Inn - stay there the weekend and make a true escape of it all, you won't be sorry!

We got married at the Sonoma Golf Club which is a beautiful location but the planning process with the Fairmont wasn’t ideal. We worked with Erika in the beginning and then Pattie ...

both were incredibly difficult to work with, Lisa was amazing for the short time we got to speak with her. Unfortunately throughout the two years of planning they were extremely unorganized, you need to be very detail oriented follow up on everything several times and often wait weeks for a response if at all. We thought it might change the month or week of the wedding but it was just as bad all the way through. They made my planning experience terrible and extremely stressful. We were so excited for the food at our wedding from what we experienced at our tasting but it wasn’t the same. The fish was undercooked and fishy, the chicken dish wasn’t the same either…assuming the chef changed which was disappointing. A month before our wedding we were also informed in person they could no longer do our cake and we would need to find someone else. Totally understand things change specially in COVID but there’s no reason they needed to wait to inform us until we were there in person for a 24 hour visit leaving us rushed and panicked to find something quickly as our venue coordinator Pattie knew we lived in MN and were in town for the weekend. The servers and bartenders at the wedding were great and the space turned out beautiful despite all the ups and downs. We also stayed at the Fairmont the weekend of our wedding, it seemed like they didn’t really know a wedding was taking place that weekend I felt disappointed and a bit sad overall with the experience. We were denied entry at the spa for us and our parents due to capacity restrictions which you’d think they’d account for weddings but we didn’t get to relax the day before our wedding or enjoy the spa which we had passes for. Overall I was disappointed with the Fairmont and our planning experience but still had an amazing time marrying my best friend! If you are hands on and extremely detail oriented who wants to review every detail to make sure it’s correct it could be a great spot as it’s so beautiful! Of course this could all change if you work with someone else at the Fairmont as these issues are easily fixed with better people in roles!

Hands down, Fairmont is the best caterer to go with for a wine country wedding. We received so many compliments on the quality of the food at our wedding. Our guests loved the crea...

tive appetizer (goat cheese flan) and the chicken dish (with amazing risotto) and vegetarian dish (Thai curry) received rave reviews. We did not have red meat at our wedding, but from our tasting, we know that ANY of the Fairmont food is delicious. We had guests tell us that our cake set the bar for all wedding cakes and they loved the surprise of a late night snack. During the planning process, every interaction we had with Fairmont was helpful, professional and so friendly - from Sasha who did our first tasting with us, to the chefs, and to Lisa who we primarily interacted with. We had a lot of different questions and requests and Lisa was always responsive and flexible with us. We had a special family recipe that we wanted to incorporate into our hor dourves, and Lisa worked with the chef to make sure we were able to serve it to guests on our wedding day. Lisa and the chef even went out of her way to let us do a special tasting of the family recipe prior to our wedding day. In addition, on the day of our wedding, we got ready at the Fairmont with our wedding party and did our first look on the property. The bridal suite was perfect for us to have many girls in one place getting hair & makeup done. The Fairmont property was a beautiful setting for our first look. We are so happy to have chosen Fairmont for our wedding day!

Kathryn , Trina and Faye ----(the best concierge in the world literally) were all great! Also the head chef but I can't remember his name. Also all the staff and servers who worked my wedding were on top of it all. It was a great night! Just wish I would have got some of my cake sent home since I didn't get to eat any :(

We fell in love with the Sonoma Mission Inn when we toured it, and met with Catherine Merry- the most amazing coordinator. Unfortunately, half way through planning she left, and th...

e new coordinator was not nearly as friendly, helpful, or knowledgeble. We ended up not doing a room block, and we had several complaints that the staff were rude and unhelpful over the phone to family asking about rates. The catering staff was amazing- the food was perfection, but our cake was also wrong. I hate fondant with a passion, and that was my only requirement for the cake- I was fuming when we entered the reception and saw a giant fondant cake. We had to hire an outside day-of coordinator because the new woman said she can't guarantee she will be there, which is dissapointing considering how much we were already paying to be there. Also, the valet backed a guest's car into a pole and we are having a hard time getting the Fairmont to pay for the repairs. Overall the guests enjoyed it, but if we were to do it all over again we would NOT have booked at the Sonoma Mission Inn.
