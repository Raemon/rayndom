on come true. Every question we had she answered and helped manage our wedding day perfectly. The venue is beyond gorgeous and we still get so many compliments of how beautiful it was. We also enjoyed the fact we could bring our own wedding food and not have to cater through the venue directly, however they still supplied the staff for plating and serving. The design team is great to work with and truly helped us create a vision within our budget. Overall, I highly recommend this venue for anyone who wants a beautiful wedding day at a fair cost. We don’t regret it all and wish we could relive this all over again!!

y thanks to all of the vendors and especially our coordinator Christina!! We were so nervous leading up to the wedding day, but once we met Christina during our rehearsal we knew she would do an incredible job. She made sure to update us throughout our wedding day, kept track of all of our guests, made sure we had a meal/drink ready at our sweetheart table waiting for us after our ceremony and kept checking in with us to make sure we didn’t need anything else. She kept us on track and on time for everything throughout the whole day. I didn’t have to worry about a single thing. I could not recommend this venue and Christina enough!! We cannot thank this team enough for making our day so special and memorable ❤️

lf is breathtaking, elegant, timeless, and surrounded by a stunning front and backyard that open up to the most beautiful mountain-view backdrop. It truly has everything one could ever imagine for a perfect, dreamy wedding. What truly transformed this beautiful venue into an unforgettable experience, though, was the Willow Heights Mansion team, led by the incredible Christina. Planning a wedding comes with its fair share of emotions and stress, but Christina has a rare gift, she brings an instant sense of calm, confidence, and reassurance. From day one, she was exceptionally professional, incredibly flexible, and genuinely invested in our vision. No request ever felt too big or too small, and she accommodated every idea with warmth and grace. On moments when the overwhelm kicked in and we felt short on ideas, Christina stepped in effortlessly with thoughtful suggestions that elevated everything. Her attention to detail, impeccable sense of timing, and seamless coordination with guests ensured the entire event flowed beautifully. The day felt classy, elegant, and perfectly paced, allowing us to truly be present and soak in every moment. We honestly could not have imagined anyone better than Christina and her team to run our wedding day. They executed everything flawlessly and, more importantly, made it deeply meaningful and memorable for us. Willow Heights Mansion will forever hold a special place in our hearts, and Christina will always be someone we’re immensely grateful for. If you are looking for a venue that’s stunning beyond words and a team that treats your wedding like their own, Willow Heights Mansion is truly unmatched.

food to the timeline, was communicated beautifully. On the day itself, the team was incredible. Everything ran so seamlessly, and their flexibility and calmness made it all feel effortless for us. The venue itself is stunning — the perfect size for our guests, with a beautiful layout that flowed naturally from the driveway to the ceremony site, cocktail hour, reception, and dance floor. We also want to thank Bittu, the caterer, for the amazing food — our guests couldn’t stop raving about it! Truly, Willow Heights was everything we hoped for and more. It was the perfect setting for our celebration, and we’re so grateful to the entire team for making it unforgettable. — M&M

I got married at Willow Heights Mansion in May 2025, and I truly cannot say enough good things about this venue and the team behind it. After my original venue fell through, I was...

in full-on panic mode, scrambling for a backup with just five months to go. I posted in a Facebook brides group venting about the disaster, and Christina from Willow Heights reached out to let me know they had my date available. She absolutely saved my wedding. Despite the short timeline, Christina helped bring our entire vision to life. The planning process was intense, but she and her team made everything feel smooth and manageable. We had a beautiful outdoor ceremony and an indoor reception with about 100 guests, and everything was flawless. The venue itself is stunning and barely needs any extra decor to shine. Savannah from the Luxe design team was incredibly patient with me, especially as I kept changing my mind about linens and florals. Christina was also always quick to respond to every question and concern I had along the way. On the actual day, the staff was amazing, the space looked gorgeous, and we got so many compliments from our guests. The get-ready rooms were also beautiful, spacious, stylish, and perfect for photos. The food was fantastic. Our guests would not stop raving about how good it was. Multiple people told us it was the best wedding food they've had ever had. One moment that really sums up the level of care we received: right before our first dance, my dress started falling apart. Christina got down on the floor with safety pins and literally fixed my dress herself. I still can’t believe it. She was calm, professional, and hands-on in a way I’ll never forget. I 100% recommend Willow Heights Mansion to any couple looking for a beautiful venue with an outstanding team. Our wedding was perfect because of them.

Our wedding experience at Willow Heights Mansion was outstanding from beginning to end. We are so grateful to Christina and her team for making our wedding day not just special, bu...

t magical. We chose WHM not only for the ambiance--which is simply outstanding--but because so many of the vendors are "built in" to the venue... catering, bar/beverage service, decor, and the DJ were all included in our overall quote. We had plenty of options but it was never overwhelming and we were glad that we didn't have to interview and choose a bunch of external vendors... in the end, we only needed to hire a photographer, wedding cake baker, and hair/makeup artist. The day itself went off flawlessly--everything went according to schedule and Christina, Raychel, and their team choreographed everything perfectly, working with the photographer to make sure we got all our planned shots and moving us through the schedule of events with practiced ease. The dinner was outstanding--special shout out to the servers who were so quick and efficient we almost didn't notice them--the bar service top notch, and our small wedding party ended the day by moving upstairs to sleep in the provided suites. The next morning, Christina delivered our breakfast order from sister property MOHI Farms in downtown Morgan Hill (also highly recommended). We're so glad that we chose WHM as our wedding venue, and will treasure the memories we made there for years to come.

ot of things in-house (coordination, decor, catering, DJ) and it made the process 100000x less stressful! But I want to focus on the incredible team at WHM! Briana, Mary, and Alisha are all part of the coordination team and I don't have enough words to describe how perfect they made the wedding for us. They are truly EXPERTS when it comes to wedding coordination and their skills shined throughout the whole process. As someone who naturally worries about so many details, they were able to ease my anxiety and stress about the entire wedding process and I really feel like our wedding day was perfect and stress-free! They were so professional and I felt like they really went above and beyond to take care of us on and our guests on our wedding day! Nicole, who is part of the Luxe Design & Decor team, also made our vision for florals and decor come to life! I extremely indecisive throughout the entire process and changed my mind quite a few teams, but Nicole was really patient and helped me bring all the ideas together! I was seriously in awe at all the florals when I saw them on the wedding day. Absolutely stunning!! Our wedding DJ, Justin, made selecting our music a piece of cake. We had a very specific song in mind and wanted to tweak it to include two versions and he made it happen! He was also such a great MC and the guests loved him. He made sure to keep the dance floor filled all night and knew exactly how to keep the party going. Our guests had such a great time! Overall, if you're looking for a venue and team that knows exactly what they're doing, I HIGHLYY recommend Willow Heights Mansion. They are absolutely incredible and I had such a seamless experience with them. I don't know how many people can say their wedding day as perfect, but I feel like ours was because of the team at WHM!

We started working with Briana and Nicole back in July of 2019 and had scheduled our wedding for September 19th, 2020. We loved the venue and the idea that everything is done throu...

gh them - catering, decor, florals, DJ (DJ Justin was awesome) and you can even opt in to stay there the night of your wedding. Through all of the stress of the pandemic, Briana (Lead Coordinator) really helped to put our minds at ease and figure out the best solution for us. We were able to safely have a small ceremony at the mansion and schedule our big wedding on our one-year anniversary. Briana went above and beyond to have both of these days be special and she really took care of us the day of our big wedding, especially when I started to get overwhelmed by all of the craziness before the ceremony. Nicole is the lead designer and florist and she truly made our vision come to fruition. Everything was beautiful and I brought a bunch of extra decor that I personalized that she and her team never complained about having to put out. The entire Willow Heights team executed everything flawlessly and it was truly the wedding of our dreams. They made having to reschedule a wedding during a pandemic painless and eased all our worries throughout the whole process. I’m honestly a little sad I won’t be working more with them anymore after 2 whole years of planning a wedding!

Heights Mansion! With so many experiences, touch points and quality time spent at this venue I can honestly say this is one of my favorite venues to photograph and celebrate! The property has the perfect blend of manicured landscape, vineyards and breath taking views. Making this a beautiful combination for couples that may have different ideas for combining their dream wedding visions... Willow Heights Mansion has it all! The getting ready rooms are clean, updated and drenched with natural light. I love that wedding parties and close family can turn their dream wedding into a sleep over! This one stop venue has it all with an incredible wedding dream team, too! Their staff is friendly, organized, punctual and truly cares about the needs of the couple and their wedding experience. They take good care of vendors, too! Many thanks to Briana and the team of coordinators for always making this venue feel magical! I love every opportunity to celebrate at the mansion!

My husband and I had our PERFECT wedding at Willow Heights Mansion earlier this year in March! Since the day we drove up the driveway for our tour with Christina, we knew that Will...

ow Heights was going to host the wedding of our dreams. No other venues stood a chance! First of all, the venue itself is drop dead gorgeous and looks exactly as photographed! With the rolling hills in the background, the beautiful finishes in the mansion, and so much more, you don't need much to make this the perfect looking venue. For some extra touches, the onsite florist/designer worked with us to pick the most beautiful flower arrangements and pieces to compliment our color theme. The day of the wedding, I was so pleased walking into the reception room to see everything come together so perfectly. It looked like a photo out of a magazine! One of the best things about this venue is the fact that it is a one stop shop! They set you up with an amazing DJ (thanks Justin!!), a florist, designer, catering (our guests raved about the food!), cake, coordinator, and so much more! They also set you up with an account for a wedding planning website which sends reminders before the big day, has a check list for bride/groom, and can help organize your seating chart (such a huge help). It felt like we barely lifted a finger to plan, yet our day turned out exactly as we wished. The thing that sets this venue apart from others is the staff. Briana W. was our wedding coordinator and went above and beyond to help us prepare and keep things running smoothly the day of. She made sure my husband and I had plenty of time to eat (we were stuffed!), brought us drinks during our shoot, and most importantly made sure we had fun while staying on schedule. She is such a complete rockstar and is so clearly experienced and passionate. Everyone said this was the smoothest wedding they had ever been to (literally not one hiccup)! Christina R. was the first person we met when we toured the venue. Throughout the year of planning for the big day, I pestered her with so many questions and she was always super responsive and so patient with me! I honestly could not imagine what it would have been like without Briana and Christina by my side for my wedding day. I can't begin to express my gratitude to all of the staff at Willow Heights Mansion for helping me plan the wedding I've dreamt of since I was a child. Every little detail was thought out and executed perfectly and my guests still call it "the best wedding they've ever been to." Thank you x1000 Willow Heights Mansion! We will cherish the memories we made here forever!

Our wedding was beautiful and Briana our coordinator was amazing. I felt very relaxed because she handled all the details, she even made sure I ate while getting ready, when my hus...

bands shoe sole came apart, she even took it to glue it back, luckily it happen after the ceremony and he had an extra pair. The many kids we had at our wedding had a blast. My only slight disappointment was the flowers because I expected more pops of navy blue. I was showed pictures of the kind of flowers that would be used and they only used a very little, more purple color pop, but they were still beautiful and design Decore does suggest ideas on how to save money when it comes to flowers. All in all I would definitely recommend this venue. We had several complements on the venue and how beautiful it was. I will never forget my wedding and how beautiful my wedding was. Thank you Willow Heights team. You girls made my wedding dream a reality.

lls and Santa Cruz (where my husband and I first met) Mountains were the ceremony background, and saw the “LOVE” sign and knew this place was it! We were looking for a venue that had all-inclusive, and the Live Love Leal and WHM team took care of it all in less than six months- everything from the food, decorations, flowers, wedding cake, music/DJ! All we had to do was decide what specific details we wanted, and the Live Love Leal teams took care of the rest. Our wedding day was perfect and seamless! Our friends/family still talk about how fun and beautiful our wedding was and how delicious the food tasted. Thank you to Briana, Janine, Christina, Brittani, DJ Justin, and more for your professionalism, expertise, and making our dream wedding come to life!

ncredible florist brought my romantic fairytale vision to life while educating us on seasonality of blooms and offering ideas for cost effective yet still gorgeous options. The catering team worked with our many dietary restrictions and requests to create a delicious menu and atmosphere which made the family style meal an important and meaningful part of our day. DJ Justin created the romantic, fun, and dance worthy playlist of our dreams, kept the flow and timing of the day perfectly on point, and was a joy to work with. Bri made my husband and I feel supported and prioritized for every step of the planning process, allowed us to simply enjoy the most beautiful day of our lives by seamlessly attending to every detail of the day, and made the days after our event relaxed by packing left and lost items. I cannot thank or recommend Willow Heights Mansion and their team enough for the beautiful work they do while managing to make their couples feel loved, supported and prioritized!

The perfect place for a perfect wedding. If you don't want to rip your hair out on the day of your wedding, go with Leal. They are all inclusive: venue, DJ, F&B, Cake + dessert, d...

ecorations, floral, and even overnight stay arrangements (6 suites). It doesn't take a visit to see that the venue is breathtaking and gorgeous. It's just as beautiful in person. Everyone that we worked with was a complete dream: Christina (Sales), Bri (Coordinator), Stephanie (Decor/flowers), Brittani (Pastry chef), and the amazing staff that was there the whole day. I literally had to show up and get ready. Their team checked on my periodically throughout the morning and made sure I was on schedule (as much as I wanted to be.) We had the most amazing day with our friends and family. The room was full of love and happiness. We can't stop talking about it. One of the best things was being able to stay in the venue overnight and not have to rush out after the wedding. The staff cleaned everything and had all our personal things/ decorations packed neatly at the front door, ready to go the next morning. They even had two to-go boxes of food for us as well as the top of the cake. The "Continental breakfast" the next day isn't a real breakfast, more list snacks, but again it was SO nice to relax with the bridal party and just enjoy the time together. My one and ONLY real complaint was the DJ. He was great most of the time until it was time to announce us as husband and wife for the first time, but got my husband's name wrong. Not enough to take a star away from the venue, but seriously.... You have two names to remember, dude. How do you screw that up? TL;DR: Amazing venue, everyone had an amazing time, DJ screwed up the announcement.

to appease her because nothing could be better than our experience, start to finish, with the mansion and staff. The mansion is stunning, the perfect set up for a wedding & party. The entire staff was incredibly friendly, accommodating & professional - all stresses & worries about planning vanished, which is surprising for someone who over-stresses about almost everything. Everyone always warned us something would go wrong, but after 3 months of trying to come up with something, anything... I cannot. I will forever recommend this venue to anyone whose dream is to have the perfect wedding.

The Willow Heights Mansion was the best decision I made for our choice of venue. We planned our wedding in about 6 months and I could not have done it without the WHM team. From th...

e beginning, I knew that I wanted a certain look for my wedding, but did not want to invest all of my time into it, as I do not have a lot of it. I wanted a simple but elegant look. From the start of searching for a venue, Christina was extremely responsive via email (and phone if needed). She helped answer all questions and was always so helpful. After we booked the venue, Briana became our coordinator and she is the absolute best. There were times where I would honestly would feel nervous and felt like things would not go smoothly since she didn't need much from me... but let me tell you, the wedding went as smoothly and beautifully as we could ever imagine because of Briana! At first, I felt a bit uneasy as they do have a set of vendors that you must use, but really, this made things a thousand times more simple/easy. I didn't have to think about different vendors, it was just all right there. They really make it easy for you! They helped put our minds at ease and allowed us to have a worry-free wedding planning process. They really made our day so special and put our minds at ease the entire day. The venue is so beautiful and accommodated our wedding of 150 so well-- we received so many compliments on how smoothly the wedding went and how beautiful the venue was. The WHM team really took care of us and made us feel like there was nothing to worry about, which was just so amazing. Christina, Briana, Stephanie, Janine and the rest of the WHM team, you are awesome and amazing!!! If you are teeter-tottering between a few venues, you should really consider the Willow Heights Mansion because they know what they are doing and they will do an amazing job at it!

We had our wedding at Willow Heights Mansion this year, and it was such a blast! The venue is incredibly beautiful, and adding the option to stay overnight with our closest friends...

made the entire experience absolutely unforgettable. The venue is located at the top of a hill, with only one wedding per day -- making the experience seem remote and oh-so-exclusive. Plenty of on-site parking too. The customer service, attention and response at this venue is unparalleled. Our coordinator, Briana, was a wonderfully positive guide and support in the entire wedding planning and execution process. The DJ is experienced and easygoing, making sure the dance floor was lively the whole night through (this was really important to us)! The WHM staff are very flexible to customizing the experience - and we pulled off a super fun 20's themed wedding. I would be quick to recommend Willow Heights Mansion to anyone looking to get married in the bay area. Top notch venue!

My husband and I had our wedding at Willow Heights back on October 12th 2018 and it was a magical day. I have to commend Briana who was our day-of coordinator for our wedding day f...

or managing so much of the wedding day craziness! From the very beginning of the wedding venue search process, we had many different appointments set up with different wedding venues, but the treatment and courtesy that we were shown from Willow Heights really helped make our choice. While it may be slightly remote from the rest of the Bay Area and the drive up the hill will have you questioning where the heck this venue is, it’s really worth checking out in person and meeting with the Mansion staff because they know how to do weddings in style and help design a special day for you. The Mansion handles the ceremony, reception, decoration, flowers, DJ services, day of coordination, and even provided a list of preferred vendors that they had worked with before and suggested for photography, hair and makeup, videography, and rehearsal dinner locations, of which we chose the officiant Steve Beck from. The whole process for the wedding planning with Willow Heights was very smooth, mostly through emails, but I did go down to the mansion about 6 times before the rehearsal and wedding days for the mandatory consultation dates. Since we also wanted an October wedding for nice weather without risking heat or rain or cold, the Fall months were quickly booked up. My then fiancé and I booked our wedding about 13 months before the wedding, so make sure you do a consultation,since when we were picking our day, a lot of the September and October dates were already booked up! We chose a Friday afternoon, outdoor wedding starting with the ceremony at 4 PM, ending at 10 PM for 120 guests. You’d think that 6 hours would be a long time for a wedding, but it really does fly by. The Mansion helped so much with having a basic wedding day timeline that we customized for our wedding day. Every time we would go to the Mansion for a consult we left with a lot of assurance and answered questions, and the staff at the Mansion are all so helpful and wonderful! The day of the wedding was CRAZY, but we stuck to the planned day schedule pretty closely. Everything worked out great, except for the Friday afternoon traffic so we pushed off the wedding ceremony by 20 minutes, but it all worked out in the end. For reference, my fiancé and I chose to do an outdoor ceremony with the arch/gazebo since the venue is just so stunning! I would suggest to any interested bridal parties to highly consider booking not only doing the ceremony and reception at the Mansion, but booking the additional overnight stay package where you get to stay in the Mansion with your bridal party in the 6 bedroom suites on the top floor. It helped us to not be rushed to shoo out of the Mansion and it allowed us to reminisce about the beautiful events that happened on our wedding day. I love that the Willow Heights Mansion staff worked with our budget, gave us options for food and drink that were highly praised by our guests, and it was the best venue that we could have chosen! I have picky asian relatives who usually go home immediately following dinner but all of my relatives stayed late and highly praised the beautiful ceremony, venue, reception center, and service. I really loved how Briana and the WHM staff worked so hard to help us prepare for the day and they were so on top of responding to our emails and questions.

w this place we knew right away we had to have it!! The rooms where everyone would get ready are so beautiful! They have this beautiful bathtub that is perfect for wedding photos!! I made a mental note that day to make sure to have a few photos in the tub in my wedding dress. The day we took our first tour of the venue was the day we put a deposit to have our wedding there. During the whole wedding process after we booked the venue, was very calming. Bri and the WHM team were always in contact with us to help us plan for flowers, food, drinks and answers every wedding question I had.. Day of the wedding.. all the employees there did everything they could to make sure my day ran smoothly! Brianna and Brian did an amazing job decorating the place and making sure all of our signs were up in places that all of our guests could see. They had mimosas and coffee ready for us and every 20 mins they came up to the rooms to check on us to make sure everything was okay! Of course there are always hiccups at weddings.. but Bri did a phenomenal job making sure ALLL OF it was dealt with in a way where I was not stressed out about it. She carried my tail and my bouquet and made sure I had something in my tummy (I was so nervous I almost forgot to eat). Made sure I used that bathroom and always asked if I needed anything! Our dj Justin was badass! He made changes in the music based on the vibes he was getting from our guests. He even was able to change our song that introduced the ring bearer and flower girl literally 30 seconds right before they were introduced! He is fantastic at his job!! Bri made sure the groom and I ate first before any of our guests did because we were going to get pulled to do a bunch of stuff so she knew we wouldn’t have time to eat. Like who thinks about little things like that?! Bri you are absolutely amazing. After the wedding I had so many text messages saying how absolutely stunning the venue was and how’s beautiful it was during sunset! If you are looking for a venue in Morgan Hill.. please take a look at Willow Heights Mansion!

On day of, they let us arrive early to start hair and make up, they made sure that my new husband and I got a chance to eat appetizers and have a moment alone after being married. They made sure we had our dinner and were well taken care of. Their getting ready rooms were clean and so beautiful with mirrors for days! They let us bring in breakfast and even provided us with coffee and tea while getting ready. Later in the morning they brought us girls mimosas and the boys some beer. Another thing our guests keep talking about is the food! Sometimes when a venue is a one stop shop their catering suffers, but Willow Heights DELIVERED! Their food was excellent and I loved that they had so many options for us to choose from. The best part about Willow Heights is that they take care of everything. From flower arrangements, catering and bakery, DJ, and day of planners. The only things I had to worry about were our officiant, hair and makeup, and photographer. But even then Willow Heights provided us with a list of recommended vendors. Having our wedding here was worth every penny and I would definitely recommend it.

The entire WHM staff is friendly, super accommodating, and more importantly they do their job well. Naturally, as a newly engaged couple you have no idea what goes into wedding planning, but the staff at WHM make sure to adequately guide you and give you advice. In addition, to the breathtaking Mansion grounds, awesome staff, the prices at WHM are quite reasonably for all the services that you get. Also, if you're a foodie like me, the food at WHM was delicious not your standard wedding food. Oh! And I can't forget the TACO TRUCK. Get the taco truck. Our guests were raving about the tacos for weeks. If WHM is on your list of possible wedding venues, look no more and book your tour today. You will not be disappointed. Special thank you to Briana, Janine, and Stephanie for being patient and super accommodating. You all made our Special Day everything that we hoped it would be and MORE!

Willow Heights Mansion is the best! Ours was one of FOUR weddings in the family this year and given all the different wedding events we had to plan and account for, opting for an ...

all inclusive venue was the best decision we could've made. Decor, flowers, DJ, cake , food, coordinator, a place to get ready...check, check, and check! We simply had no time to research and compare a bunch of vendors. EVERYTHING was handled for us and the mansion did a beautiful job. Venue: Impressive! We fell in love with it the moment we set foot on the grounds. We got married in July and it was pretty hot. The mansion does provide umbrellas as shade for guests for the outside ceremony, but a friend was gracious enough to let us borrow her parasols. I highly suggest providing guests with fans (super affordable on Amazon). The mansion itself is air-conditioned which helped and the staff provided electric fans inside. Decor and bakery team: Communication was simple and timely. They did a great job while taking into account our vision and ideas. Food: Delicious! There was no problem at all with making adjustments for our guests with dietary restrictions. The tasting offered prior to our big day was a fun date night in itself! Coordination: We met with Christina when booking the venue. She was informative and super sweet. She helped us work with our budget and made the process of locking down the venue so painless. Briana was our coordinator and she was AWESOME! Not only is she so easy to talk to, she was super helpful, organized, and responsive leading up to the big day. On the actual day, we felt completely relaxed with her in charge. She knows the mansion and the event process like the back of her hand so no detail was overlooked. The day went by so quickly but she naturally just took little things into account like where my bouquet was, when to grab my garter when it was time for the garter toss, where my slippers were so I could change into them mid-reception, etc! At the end of the night, we unfortunately left a few things at the venue, but Briana found all the items and sent them back to us. She is a true lifesaver before, during, and after any event! We would like to extend our utmost appreciation to the staff at WHM for making our day so memorable. Can't say enough good things about Willow Heights Mansion. It will always hold a special place in our hearts.

our day-of coordinator, but in reality she was available throughout the entire planning process to answer last-minute questions and provide insight into the venue as we finalized our wedding plans. The team truly takes the stress out of planning, and the fact that they help coordinate flowers/decorations/cake with Deluxe Design Decor--a fabulous team as well--made the process a breeze. It was lovely to have a gorgeous venue like the mansion to ourselves for the day as we celebrated with our family and loved ones. It's such a beautiful location and all the details make the venue so romantic and timeless. While nearly everything is coordinated in house, from DJ to decor to catering, you still feel like your special day is personalized as you make all the details your own!

ined on our wedding day. Everything at the mansion runs like a very well-oiled machine, including contingency plans! The team was able to convert our entire outdoor ceremony to a gorgeous indoor one, and we didn't have to make the decision to move it indoors until the day of the wedding (they are so experienced that they only needed 2-3 hours heads up, which meant we were able to see what the weather was like that morning before making a final decision on indoor/outdoor). Our wedding coordinator, Briana, helped me feel calm and assured about the entire process and she made sure I didn't have any stress the day of. I really appreciated all her input and help during the planning process and day-of details! Willow Heights Mansion requires that you hire one of their coordinators as part of the package, and I can't begin to say how helpful it was not having to do everything alone. The mansion is also contracted with their own caterer/chef (the food is amazing, by the way, and you get a luxurious tasting for 2 before you choose your menu!), DJs, and florist. This was a huge bonus since we didn't have to stress about finding our own caterer, DJ or florist, and everyone was used to communicating and working with each other so there were no glitches. All we had to do was find our photographer! If you're considering this venue, think of is the ease of having the ceremony/reception in a single location (no transportation costs shuttling guests between sites, no lost guests, etc.), the stunning view of the surrounding hills and valley, and the incredibly friendly staff. Our guests raved that this was one of the best weddings they've been to, and of course, I wholeheartedly agree!

The place is just fabulous. It sits on top of a winding road, surrounded by beautiful sceneries and rolling hills. Honestly, it looks a post card! The building is pretty spacious a...

nd has a very versatile layout, so you can plan a wedding in any season, I would think. Ours was in the very beginning of Spring 2018. The dining area overlooks the surrounding hills, which looked super green, lush, and gorgeous for our wedding. You can have your ceremony inside or outside where there is a nice set up complete with an arbor, which can be dressed different ways. There is even a huge stylized LOVE sculpture that is great for the photo shoot. They have 5 rooms plus the honeymoon suit upstairs, which you could stay in the night before and after – I highly recommend doing that. You can order food for lunch and dinner if you stay or go for a ten-minute drive to the town. Upstairs there is also a balcony, which was so nice for photos especially the ones shot with a drone! We knew this is the right venue right away but what made it an exceptional experience was the staff. We had about three months and the only thing already ordered was the bride’s outfit! Never the less, we pulled it off in the best possible way. In fact, we had many of our guests calling us later to say our this was the best wedding they had ever attended! They were saying even the food was amazing – which is one thing you don’t hear often about weddings ;-) The staff ran our wedding like an amazing machine – everything was done correctly and better than expected. Everyone was friendly and great at their jobs. You get everything in one place, food, drinks, flower, planning, DJ, etc. Incidentally, our centerpieces were getting a lot of compliment too – then again everything was! We had a Persian Wedding, so it was more work, but they were able to make it happen. The staff had even researched “Persian Wedding” to become familiar with the customs and rituals. Who does this? The venue is run by a tremendous lady and her staff. Her name is Briana. She and Brian made sure we had everything we needed. Briana is just amazing. Our bride and groom had their heart set on outside ceremony but that day the sky was playing so many tricks. It went from rain, to hail, to sun, and back to rain several times. We all thought the outside ceremony is impossible. But Briana was watching the weather minute by minute and found a period where there would be no rain. She turned an unthinkable to a beautiful doable situation. The staff set up the outside (including flowers on the arch and setting up the Persian Sofreh) in a blink of an eye (amazing!) and our couple got the wedding of their dreams. Speaking of wonderful people, we started the process with Christina Raie, who was an angel, very kind, accommodating, and superb at her job. We knew we are in good hands as soon as we met her. She got us to the tasting (wonderful experience – take the whole family) in the nick of time, helped us with our planning since we didn’t hire a planner, and in short made sure we got all the things we wanted. Our bride and groom were so happy with their experience they were saying there was not even one thing they wished was done different. Our 220 guests were also amazed and had a beautiful experience (we heard so many compliments). And by the way, the wedding was for my son – in case you are wondering, and I was very involved.

They are overachievers. They are so organized and on top of everything and go above and beyond for you so you aren't stressed out at all. The price of our wedding was so reasonable as well. Great quality overall for a great price!!!! I think my favorite thing about Willow Heights Mansion is the staff. Of course the venue is gorgeous, but the people make your wedding planning experience so blissful and easy!! My sister already knows she will be getting married at one of their properties. I am the first to get married in my family so my parents and I didn't really know much about wedding planning. They guided us through everything and definitely have the experience to make your wedding a dream come true. HIGHLY recommend getting married at either Willow Heights Mansion or one of their other wedding venues!!!!!!

ry about a thing, down to every detail. They took care of the decorations, DJ, catering, schedule, planning, minute details, everything you could possibly think of, and I could just enjoy my perfect day. The reason I had a perfect day was because of the staff and this venue. They curated my schedule so I wouldn't miss a thing, and Brianna (my amazing coordinator) made sure everything was running smoothly, would let me know any pertinent information as it came up so I would be well-informed but never stressed, and would make sure I had the chance to eat, grab a drink, and enjoy my day. She is the reason I wanted to write this review- she was so helpful, understanding, patient, awesome to be around, and enthusiastic. If you're on the fence about your wedding venue, this one will give you the perfect wedding that you've always dreamed of. They handled every seemingly stressful situation with grace and understanding, they decorated the venue to perfection, and held onto items that accidentally were left overnight and safely had them returned to their owners. I can't recommend it enough. Thank you so much WHM for the best day of my life!

Most important to Christina who was there the entire day, and dealt with our crazy wedding party, and family! They were all so patient. Thank you all for everything!! Jasmine and Joe

I had the best experience with Willow Heights Mansion! The staff is very helpful and attentive through the entire process. The whole experience was stress free and totally worth th...

e money! They are very organized and have the entire process down where I didn't have to worry at all. I highly recommend this spot for your ceremony and reception! We paid extra to stay overnight in their suites at the mansion and that was well worth it after a long day for us and our bridal party! The rooms are spacious, comfortable and have full bathrooms. This location is beautiful inside and out and I wouldn't have wanted my wedding day to be anywhere else! I can say that I really feel like the staff have become like family to us!

Working with Willow Heights Mansion made me wish I had to plan a wedding every year! They just made the process that much fun! From the moment we booked our tour of Willow Height...

s Mansion, we felt like we were being taken care of by the amazing staff. We were shown around the gorgeous property, and we immediately knew this was the place. The breathtaking photos you see online are EXACTLY what the venue looks like, and if you take one on your phone while on tour, you’ll see that it needs no editing whatsoever. It really does look that pretty in person! Willow Heights Mansion is an all-in-one venue, which means that most of your wedding needs are handled by their vendors. What we didn’t know was just how great all of the vendors that work with Willow Heights Mansion are. They have gathered a truly exceptional group of chefs, bakers, florists, decorators, DJs/MCs, and wedding coordination teams. Each one surpassed our wildest expectations and blew us away. The best part about this was that, for all of these vendors, it felt like a HUGE weight lifted off of our shoulders. We felt like everyone was taking care of us, and reaching out to help when the time was appropriate. They kept track of when they needed to meet with us, which made the planning process a piece of cake. The head Chef, Mark Johnson, is phenomenal. The food tasting was a great experience, set up by the staff as a fun event for wedding couples, where we got to ask the chef questions in-person, and stuff ourselves with all of the amazing food and wine we could eat. Tasting the desserts by the Live+Love+Léal bakery was equally mouthwatering. We ended up going with a green-tea buttercream flavored cake, and our guests still cannot stop talking about it. Our DJ, Justin Horrell, did a fantastic job MC-ing and DJ-ing at the wedding, and imbuing the room with energy. He even stretched out the recessional music we wanted to make it long enough for everyone to walk down the aisle. In short, he was exactly what we wanted in a DJ, and a genuinely nice and fun guy! As for the decor and flowers, I could gush about those guys all day! They were extremely patient and helpful with all of my questions and last-minute changes. The day of the wedding, I was overwhelmed by how beautiful and perfect my bouquets turned out. The colors, the flowers, the arrangements, were so perfect I wanted to cry. As a designer, it honestly made my day that much happier, and I’m so excited to be drying my flower petals so I can preserve them forever! Finally, the coordinators: my rocks throughout this process. Briana was our main coordinator, and along with Christina, and a few other team members, they ensured our entire planning process was smooth and, above all, fun! Right from the get-go, they were super friendly, responsive, easy to contact, and helpful. They truly felt like they took us in as family. Briana did everything to ensure we were happy and taken care of on our wedding day, bringing us food and snacks, and packing cake and all the decor for us! Christina also ran our rehearsal dinner the night before, and was a huge help overall as I probably sent her a million questions over the course of the planning process. They are truly the friendliest people you will find, and go above and beyond to ensure your day is magical. I honestly don’t know how we could have picked a better place than Willow Heights Mansion. In short, it was our dream come true, and we cannot thank the entire team enough!

We recently had our wedding at Willow Heights Mansion and, honestly, it was the best decision we could have made. Willow Heights Mansion is an all in one venue and they knocked it ...

out of the park in every way. The staff was always welcoming, friendly, and so very patient with all the questions we had. They promptly responded to all of our emails, ensured we were constantly up to date with everything we needed and simply took care of us in exactly the way you’d hope for during a pretty hectic time in your life. The team had everything incredibly well organized; they would set up all the appointments (for tastings, decor, walkthroughs, etc) and took care of all the little details. The venue itself is absolutely breathtaking. We still get compliments from our friends about how picturesque the wedding was. From the surrounding landscape to the interior of the mansion itself, there isn’t a place you can look without being truly impressed. As for the decorations, everything was exactly what we had described and executed to perfection. The floral arrangements received compliment on top of compliment and my wife has taken up preserving flower petals to try and keep the beautiful colors around longer. The day of was executed to perfection. Despite the summer heat, the Mansion was cool and comfortable all day long. Our coordinators were always around and they kept everything absolutely under control. Everyone (wedding party and guests) knew exactly what we needed to do, where we needed to be and when. After the ceremony, our lovely staff brought a tray of hors d’oeuvres for the wedding party to make sure we all got to try them (and later on, during pictures, even ran to grab some more when we got a little hungry). The food was phenomenal. Narrowing down our tasting to the cocktail hour and dinner menus was incredibly difficult for no other reason than that there isn’t anything you’d want to cut out. All of our guests were raving about the hors d’oeuvres as we jumped through cocktail hour and the dinner was equally amazing. I could go on and on about how simply perfect the wedding was but the point I’m trying to make is that having our wedding at Willow Heights was the perfect way to begin our lives as husband and wife. The venue, the staff, the food, and the decor were all better than we could have possibly hoped for and we would choose them again in a heartbeat.

This was the most beautiful venue! I am so glad we chose it for our wedding. All of our guests haven't stopped saying how it was the best wedding and most beautiful venue. The food...

was amazing, the view was amazing, and the people that work there are absolutely amazing! The best thing is that it is an all inclusive venue where they take care of everything in house. We went and picked out everything from decor to food and cake and alcohol. All I had to bring was a few personal decorations. We even had options for fun things like a photo booth and s'mores bar which everyone loved! I would say the only con about this place was that when we had our wedding in July it was very hot and windy (which we can't really control) and the air conditioning isn't too good in the Mansion, but no one really complained and they brought out fans to put throughout the venue during the reception. Briana the coordinator was absolutely amazing. She made sure we had everything we needed from the moment we got to the venue to get ready up until the morning after when we left. I know I'm biased but this was honestly the best wedding I've ever been to and it had a lot to do with the venue!

I fell in love with Willow Heights the minute I saw a picture of it.Needless to say this venue blew me away with all they did for us and was the perfect place to have a wedding. Fo...

r their prices, you get what you pay for. Friday is cheaper than Saturday but Friday also has a 100 guest minimum vs a 150 guest minimum. This venue was so worth it to us that we chose to have a Friday wedding instead of a Saturday like we originally wanted. Friday actually was an amazing idea and we still had a high turn out. The staff is incredible. Once we met Briana the lead coordinator, we knew we were in good hands. Once you meet her you will know what I mean. She went over so many little details that are important yet we didn't think of (this is the room you get ready in, this is the room you change into your dress in, this is where cocktail hour is, after the ceremony the bridal party goes into another room for a champagne toast, this is where the bridal party is announced etc... Over the last few months, I felt like I could turn to Briana like she was a friend and ask for advice/input and she would reply RIGHT away! Our wedding day ran so incredibly smooth. One of the biggest pieces of advice I got before getting married was to not forget to eat. Briana made sure we ate (cocktail hour appetizers and cake too!), had plenty of water/wine and planned our meal during the time everyone else (and vendors) were eating so that we could actually enjoy dinner. Third and the best part, Leal has an incredible staff that runs like a "one stop shop" meaning the DJ, catering, cake and decorations/flowers are all taken care of by the venue. It makes the wedding planning process so incredibly easy when you don't have to keep contact information for 10 different vendors, or worry about a vendor not showing up /getting lost/not knowing the venue well enough, and the vendors that you do have are at that venue every weekend so you don't have to give them details/worry about them getting lost. They all know how to work together as well. All you will need to book is a photographer, officiant, hair and makeup artist which the venue has recommendations for. It allowed me to focus my time and energy on other important wedding tasks. Other Perks: -THE FOOD IS GOOD! I had people telling me this all night and still today. Other venues charge insane amounts for a super bland chicken made in bulk. -They even accommodated our vegetarian/keto diet friends too. \- DJ Justin led the first dance, father daughter/mother son dance, bouquet toss, cake cutting, and garter toss all back to back. Then the night was ours. Personally I don't like when music gets interrupted to do a bouquet toss and felt like this flowed WAY better. \- We didn't have to set up or clean up (seriously other venues make you do this?) -Since this is a mansion, they offer 6 rooms for guests/bride/groom to stay in the night of the wedding. This was also a nice perk. They let you get ready there the morning of too. -They let us keep our dresses at the venue the night before. You have no idea how stress free that made me, NOT having to think about If I had my veil/shoes/dress/hairpiece/garter or not -You don't have to consider little things like linen/chair/table rentals. Its all already there and chairs/tables are included -As long as there wasn't a wedding, they didn't care if we randomly popped in to walk around the venue, have a picnic, show our friends, our moms friends etc...

Our wedding was here and everything was wonderful. We were lucky enough to have Briana as our coordinator. She was pleasant to work with, very professional, and had good ideas th...

roughout the process (and answered all of my last minute questions). She also found ways to work within my budget (winning!). Although I had at lot planned for this wedding, she was a perfect person to oversee everything. Her staff was professional and very kind to my guests (I had many guests tell me how beautiful everything was). All night, Briana made sure to check in with us to make sure we were having a good time and things were going according to schedule. My sister now wants to have her 10 year wedding anniversary party here. I highly recommend this place...especially Briana!
