If you're looking for a custom suit that makes you feel like the sharpest, most stylish version of yourself, you should absolutely check out As You Are in San Francisco. I worked w...

ith Clint, the owner and tailor behind the brand, to create two custom looks for my recent wedding weekend and I couldn’t be happier with both the experience working with Clint or the quality of the final finished pieces. For our first night party before the wedding, Clint made me a bright green blazer that struck the balance between a bold splash of color and James Bond-worthy "shoot to kill" haberdashery. It set a perfect tone for the weekend - celebratory, refined, but still full of personality. For the ceremony itself he helped me design a custom Loro Piana suit that instantly became the favorite thing in my closet. The fit and the fabric came out exceptional, and the suit still felt like a million bucks even after a couple hours of hard dancing in the middle of the Mexican desert. From the very first meeting Clint brought a thoughtful, attentive eye to the process. He has an awesome sense of style (seriously, he’s one of the best-dressed people you’ll ever meet) and a gift for understanding not just what you want to wear, but how you want to feel wearing it. That kind of care and thoughtfulness really came through in the finished product. Both pieces are now staples in my wardrobe that I'm literally inventing excuses to reach for again. They’re beautifully made, timeless in design, and built to last for years. More than that, they feel personal... they've got a story and memories attached to them, plus a whole lot of personality. If you’re thinking about having something made for a special occasion, or just want to upgrade your closet with something custom, I can’t recommend Clint highly enough. His work is thoughtful, stylish, and personal, and my whole experience working with him reflected that from start to finish. Thanks Clint!!!

with us on fabric selection (with great recommendations based on our specific color/shade requests), sizing, alterations, and every aspect of the tuxedo construction. The final result was impeccable, with a perfect fit on the jacket, pants, and shirt. We couldn't have asked for a better experience! Highly recommend Clint and As You Are for anyone looking for top-notch custom formalwear!

So happy with how it turned out I went to Clint initially for a dinner jacket, but going through the fitting and seeing how much more form fitting some of his work was I realized ...

my existing tux didn't actually look as good as a thought, especially not for my wedding day, so I ended up doing a full tux. Clint was super helpful in thinking through materials, fit, and design, aw well as a bunch of useful resource for accessories (bow ties etc.). I'm a medium build guy and had always worn off the rack stuff with little need for adjustment (I thought), but after getting a tux from Clint I realized my prior ones did not actually fit to the same degree, or give the same quality look. The custom fit feels comfortable, you don't notice it on you as much. No collar pull on the back of the neck when you're sitting, no shoulder tightness, etc. It turned out super super well and I was really glad I prioritized it when I got the photos back. I definitely think it's worth getting the fit and plan to get more pieces from Clint that aren't just tuxedos / formal wear.

ket for my upcoming wedding. From the moment I stepped into Clint's cozy boutique, I was captivated by the warm and inviting ambiance. Normally, designing custom clothing can be an overwhelming experience, with so many options to choose from, but he masterfully guided me through the options towards the design and styles that I was resonating with. Every detail of the jackets were absolutely perfect, the fit is spot on, and the fabric is exceptional. My eyes have now been opened to the possibilities out there, and I will certainly be doing more business with Clint down the line. If you're seeking personalized, high-quality custom clothing that showcases your individuality, I strongly encourage you to talk with Clint, he will be your guide. Prepare to be wowed by his exceptional craftsmanship, attentive service, and vast array of options.

, Clint makes the entire process enjoyable. I couldn't be happier with all the pieces Clint has put together for me, and the compliments I've received on them didn't hurt either. I look forward to working with Clint in the future and highly recommend him if you're in the market for bespoke clothing.

esigned my perfect wedding tux that came out better than one could have dreamed. Additionally he also was helpful in sparking some creativity for another suit that I love and use every chance I get. He is incredible responsive, thoughtful, listens deeply and truly is wonderful to work with. Not one part of my experience was underwhelming. I have recommended him to many close friends of mine for their biggest events and have yet to hear anything but raving reviews. While it’s more expensive than a suit from a department store it is absolutely worth every penny. Would recommend anyone looking for a new suit or look to have a chat with Clint!
