Thanks to recommendations from couples on The Knot

Green Oaks Creek Farm is a picturesque outdoor wedding venue in Pescadero, CA, set against the backdrop of the Santa Cruz Mountains. Owner Stephanie Jennings and her husband opened this farm in 1999. They wanted to create an organic, educational farm that would help people learn about sustainability and earn master's degrees in plant and soil science before doing so. Meanwhile, the beauty of the landscape inspired them to open an event center in 2001 to share the stunning setting with more people. At Green Oaks Creek Farm, you can start the day's festivities with a ceremony at the base of the Santa Cruz mountains in a clearing that offers stunning views of both the farm and the ocean. A spacious redwood deck for the wedding party and wooden benches for seating up to 200 guests are provided. After exchanging vows, have a celebratory toast with your guests in a bloom-filled perennial garden. A passionflower-covered fence surrounds this space, transforming the garden into a private oasis. You'll find a clearing and a deck with plenty of space for a cocktail party at the garden's edge. The garden also features a patio with a bar for those all-important toasts. You're invited to host your receptions just a short walk from the Ceremony Garden. This space features an outdoor kitchen for your catering company to use, as well as a stone patio and fire pit. Couples and a number of guests can make themselves at home on the farm for the whole weekend and stay in the wooded campground and furnished cabins. Green Oaks Creek Farm offers an all-inclusive wedding package to help streamline the planning process. The various event spaces are also fitted with furniture, including cocktail tables and benches. The reception space has a built-in dance floor and string lighting to help enhance the atmosphere.

Stephanie Jennings

Co-Founder and Co-Owner 

Before starting the farm at Green Oaks, Stephanie Jennings worked on farms in the Santa Cruz area and in Costa Rica. She also taught environmental education for several years. One day she and her husband decided to combine their love of farming and environmental teaching with their desire to help create a more just, sustainable, and healthy food system by starting an organic, educational farm. To achieve this goal, they earned Masters of Science degrees in Plant and Soil Science. They also completed course work in Holistic Resource Management and Permaculture Design. In 1999 they started Green Oaks Creek Farm. The beauty of their land inspired them to simultaneosly start a wedding and event center, thereby enabling them to share their stunning spot with an ever expanding circle of people. They ran the farm for fourteen years with the help of apprentices and volunteers. In 2014 they decided to retire from farming and to lease the farm business to beginning farmers. They continue to run the wedding and event business at Green Oaks while raising their two daughters, Sienna and Anna.

Words really can't describe just how highly we recommend Green Oaks Creek Farm. We had an unforgettable time planning and hosting our wedding at this magical place. If you have t...

he opportunity to host an event at this venue, you will surely walk away, as we did after our wedding, in complete awe of the property, owners & staff, and experience overall. The owners, Stephanie and Paul, are extremely responsive and accommodating, and invited us to visit GOCF whenever we needed leading up to our wedding to coordinate with other vendors. They were so pleasant to work with from the moment we first emailed to the moment we hugged goodbye! The space: The property is breathtaking, with several different terraces that have their own unique spaces and vibes. From the upper terrace where we held our ceremony, you can look over the pacific ocean while shaded by tall eucalyptus trees. In the garden, you can relax on the grass and meander through the lovingly curated garden beds. A short stroll bordered by garden beds (which were bursting with dahlias at the time of our wedding in October) and you'll arrive at the reception area which is open, well-manicured, and also gives priceless views of the ocean, the surrounding meadows, and flower beds. GOCF also offers rental of numerous dwellings on the property. We took advantage of a package that included all three rentals for 2 nights. They were very clean, stylish, and stocked with everything you may need for a special weekend. Other awesome GOCF offerings: The owners clearly love and meticulously care for the land here. In the garden and in the reception area there are very large (and very stunning) live-edge bar tables made from reclaimed wood from the property. The reception area also has many smaller live-edge reclaimed wood cocktail tables. The hosts also provided as many wood benches as we needed for the ceremony space. It was awesome that we didn't need to rent seating for the ceremony space! The reception area also has a beautiful stone dance floor, an awesome fire pit which Stephanie and Paul provided wood for AND lit for us both the night before and night of our wedding. Edison string lights are hung all throughout the reception area and the walkways throughout the property are well lit. There is also a kitchen space in the reception area that was easily accessible to our caterers and was available for us to use the night before our wedding to host our rehearsal dinner. Being a working flower farm, we also highly recommend purchasing flowers directly from the farm! It was so cool to have flowers in our bouquets and vases that had been picked just steps away. Their prices are very reasonable and they had a fantastic variety. GOCF provided for us our dream quintessential coastal California wedding. Go check it out and you’ll see why it’s so, so uniquely special.

If you're looking for a wedding venue, look no further! We highly recommend Green Oaks Creek Farm, for so many reasons. To name a few... Working with Stephanie and Paul at Green O...

aks Creek Farm made the whole wedding process so much smoother. They were patient, kind, thoughtful, organized, communicative, and detailed - all the things you'd want when planning a wedding. Not only did they provide us with a list of vendors to work with nearby, but they also took the time to give us thoughtful suggestions and even things we could use (like a beautiful wooden bench, beautiful flowers to make bouquets with, etc.) because of their expertise. You can really tell that they've worked with so many people and have so much experience, and it pairs beautifully with their true passion in providing a beautiful space to have a wedding! They were also really easy to communicate with - they respond very quickly and will work with you to make sure you are getting what you wished for (and more)! On the day of the wedding, they were there on site, able to help you when you needed and took so much time to help set up the space too. The venue itself is beautiful, breathtaking, and even more beautiful in-person. You really don't have to do much to make this space beautiful... With three different areas to use, you have so much flexibility, places to entertain, all while being in the outdoors. We had our wedding at the end of September and it was a beautiful and comfortable place for our guests to be in. One of the compliments we got the most from our wedding was the venue! Everyone loved the peaceful environment the garden area created, the fire pit that folks could sit around in the reception area, in addition to the beautiful ocean and mountain views. There are multiple outlets so it's very well equipped for DJ's, portable restrooms, etc. In addition to that, the lighting they have set up at night is spectacular! Our catering team was able to work seamlessly in the kitchen area as well and Stephanie was available to answer any and all questions. Plus parking is super easy and free! :) None of the guests had any issues with finding the venue too - Stephanie and Paul have signs so thoughtfully laid out. Another favorite part were the cabins! The cabins are conveniently located at the venue that we used to stay overnight and use to get ready in. Stephanie and Paul thoughtfully equipped them with amenities and it made the whole experience so much easier. The location of the venue is amazing! Right off the coast, tucked away, but close-by to beautiful areas for your guests to explore.

Wonderful venue. We had our wedding here in Fall 2025 and everyone had a great experience. It's a beautiful space full of nature and flowers. There are separate areas for the cerem...

ony, cocktail hour, and reception, which mixes up the event. The owners are friendly and accommodating - having an event here comes with all of the benefits of working with a family as opposed to a big company. They graciously helped us with some last-minute requests like making bouquets for our altar, which was above and beyond. They also put a lot of work into making sure the venue was landscaped and clean for the event. A few tips if you host a wedding here: 1) It can get cold at night so I'd rent extra heaters (and the rental companies can sell out so reserve early); 2) You will need to rent/buy/bring a good amount of stuff (eg dinner tables, chairs, etc.) so budget that; 3) The largest shuttle busses can't turn around on the property so you're limited to the ~30 person busses (which are still fairly large); 4) If you use the top ceremony site and garden there's a bit of walking (which we loved) but make sure you give extra warning to guests to wear comfortable shoes and have backup transport for folks who can't walk far; 5) The flowers the venue sells are beautiful and worth buying/using; 6) There's limited cell service. Overall, none of the above were issues for us because we managed them well. I'd strongly recommend this venue if you're looking for a friendly, beautiful, outdoor space and you are excited about the flexibility to make it your own experience vs using more of a cookie cutter venue. Multiple people reached out after the event to rave about how cool and unique Green Oaks Creek Farm was. 5 stars!

Our ceremony was up on the deck with exquisite views of the ocean. And the reception area is built out perfectly with a dance floor, cafe lighting, fire pit and an outdoor kitchen. Our guests were gushing about how perfect it was!

friends this past July. Stephanie and Paul were so incredibly kind, helpful and accommodating, and made our weekend the best it could be. We decided to purchase the majority of our flowers (mostly dahlias) from the farm which was the best decision! The dahlias are stunning and added so much brightness and beauty to the day. Our guests have continued to rave about the wedding and the venue, expressing how much they loved the relaxed, nature vibe and the joy of being able to explore so many areas of the property and see all the beauty. We stayed the whole weekend on the property (Friday morning-Sunday afternoon). Our family and friends camped and we slept in one the tiny homes on the property. GOCF checked off all of our wedding dreams and even added so much more than we could have ever imagined. If you are looking for a beautiful, peaceful, accommodating venue filled with so much love- this is the place for you! I highly recommend taking a tour to see it for yourself!

The wedding literally could not have gone any better. We would absolutely recommend Green Oaks Creek Farm.

professional, and very patient with my many many questions. We were able to go look at the venue multiple times to help dial in details which was really helpful. Booking the whole weekend was the perfect option for us. We live camping so the camp site was the perfect option and a great place for guests to retire to after the reception. We had our ceremony in the garden and it was the most beautiful setting. Stephanie and her husband were available for any needs the entire weekend and really set us up for a very successful weekend.

as a quick process from our first conversation to when we locked in our date, because we knew immediately after visiting the farm that it was our dream venue. We spent about 3 hours when we first visited the site chatting with Stephanie and seeing all the amazing areas the farm has to offer. We hung out with their farm kitties too, that was a bonus for sure! They allowed us to come back and visit multiple times before our wedding, which really helped create our vision. We were able to bring our own outside vendors and built our ideal dream wedding. Their referred vendor list was super helpful as well. We utilized the beautiful flowers they grow on site for our wedding, and Kade who helped organize our flower order was amazing. They grow the most magnificent dahlias and made our bouquets and center pieces so special. They had the flowers prepped and ready for us to build our own center pieces the day before. Kade also built our ceremony arbor, and it was better than we could have imagined! Finding a space that allowed some of our guests to camp on property, that we could have for the whole weekend and provided so much variety in the space was the key in throwing the best wedding. Our guests loved the different areas and being able to really immerse in the space. Stephanie was always accessible the weekend of and always there if we needed any assistance. She made the entire process seamless and easy, and gave us the autonomy with the space that we loved. We very much intend to come back to visit and have our anniversary party there in the future. This is truly a hidden gem that showcases this beautiful coastal area, and we’re thankful to have found it!

ming - Paul and Stephanie have the place looking so beautiful theres not much that needs to be done. IT was the perfect venue for us since we had a large guest count, and wanted the ability for people to stay overnight and continue the party. they have a wonderful tiered camping area near the ceremony site where people can set up camps and RV’s/trailers. We had people move there and used silent disco- it was a hit. No amplified music at 11 pm- which is totally reasonable. There is also very little service there- so the camping option was a great option. Pescadero is also a very small town, so calling an uber is not really an option for guests. Most who didn’t camp stayed at Costa noa- the resort nearby (2 day minimum stay however). There are also other accommodations near pescadero that can be considered. Most of our guests however were from santa cruz- which is not a far drive. The farm is also very large- theres so many areas of the farm that can be utilized. We planned for a lot of decor- however at the end of the day it was entirely unnecessary since the farm itself is so beautiful to begin with- with the dahlias blooming and the ocean view. We had the ceremony up top where you can see the ocean, a cocktail hour in the garden and then reception near the outdoor kitchen with the dance floor area. We booked the entire weekend and it was so worth it! Rehersal was on friday at the farm. Paul and Stephanie offer many things actually- there are 3 cute cabins that we were able to house some guests and we slept in as well- they have all the amenities and are beautifully made. an outdoor bbq/kitchen area, 3 picnic tables and more. Additionally, working with Paul and Stephanie was super amazing- they were so kind and accommodating to share their space. Reaching them was also extremely easy. Stephanie also gave me an incredible amount of time to set up prior which is not technically part of our contract. Among other things, they were wonderful and warm to work with. In all the stress some of the best moments were when i was able to spend a morning at the farm quietly setting up. Was a beautiful environment and amazing time. Highly recommend! also the professional photos taken by Marcus Trawick

We are so grateful to have been married at Green Oaks Creek Farm! Stephanie and Green Oaks Creek Farm were lovely to work with, they were relaxed, professional, communicative, and ...

friendly. I felt supported along the way! When questions or needs came up, Stephanie was responsive and present for the process. The venue itself is absolutely beautiful, with ocean views, coastal mountains, and a tucked away feeling that created a nice intimate gathering. They take amazing care of the property, the gardens were gorgeous and the reception meadow had everything you would need for an outdoor wedding (fire pit, great dance floor, beautiful landscaping, outdoor kitchen, string lights, etc). All of our guests were commenting on how much they loved the venue. You can tell the owners put a lot of love into their property, it is well tended and care for and that made the wedding all the more special. They also provide flowers from their farm on site. Our wedding aligned with dahlia season and my friends and I did all of the flowers together. One of my highlights was the flower arranging the day before our wedding on site. We had such a great time and Stephanie was so supportive with all the flowers. I was blown away by how abundant and beautiful they were. All in all, I highly recommend Green Oaks Creek Farm!

We feel very fortunate to have found and got married at Green Oaks Creek Farm. The farm is located on the Pacific coast between Santa Cruz and Half Moon Bay, on a short drive up of...

f the road from Pie Ranch. The venue is private and receives a considerable amount of sunshine as compared to further up in the Bay Area. The owners, Stephanie and Paul, are lovely people who were supportive and quick to respond to any questions that came up. We visited a handful of times in the lead-up to the wedding and they were always welcoming. On the day, everything seamlessly transitioned on-site from final prep in the cabins, onto the ceremony, then into the cocktail garden just behind it and finally the guests made their way across the farm to reception for dinner and dancing. The owners put up fairy lights for us, which added to the ambiance of the beautiful setting. The reception area includes a dance floor and fire pit. We were able to customize our vendors and used the following to round out the day - DJ Mark Maiden - DJ services Vibes - bar and shuttle services Orens - food service Hellstrom photography - photos Companion bakeshop - cake and bread Luxury Mobile Restrooms - toilets Events by the bay - day of coordination Ben Marks films - videographer (international) Florals - DIY Ultimately we could not have dreamed of a better day and highly recommend Green Oaks Creek Farm to anyone looking for a relaxed, outdoor wedding!

er. This was the perfect venue for that. The scenery is outstanding, from the wildflowers on the farm to the view of the ocean to the fire pit in the evenings. Our out of town guest especially enjoyed visiting this hidden part of coastal California. The fact that it was available for the whole weekend really made it work for us. The farm can accommodate guests who want to camp and those want to stay in hotels nearby; it was near enough to Santa Cruz to make logistics like a run to Costco for food on Friday easy; it felt relaxed and also classy. It’s definitely an outdoor venue, but with enough facilities to make it surprisingly practical (e.g. the little cabins where our parents stayed and we got dressed). Our guests commented on how much they enjoyed the venue. Stephanie was extremely accommodating and a big part of making this happen. She suggested an outstanding wedding coordinator and helped us work out all the details when we had questions. If you’re looking for an outdoor wedding venue on the coast Green Oaks Creek Farm cannot be beat. The only thing we’re sad about is we can’t get married here again.

We got married at GOCF in November 2022 and it was a *dream*. Steph & Paul are wonderful to work with and will do everything they can to support your vision and wedding vibe. The ...

vast majority of our guests (110-115) were traveling from across the country, so we were eager to showcase the surrounding natural beauty and GOCF did not disappoint. Ocean views for the ceremony + a beautiful garden for cocktail hour + cozy campfire in the evening = perfection. Highly recommend for anyone interested in a relaxed, authentic, coastal wedding!

My husband and I were recently married at Green Oaks Creek Farm in late October and we highly recommend this beautiful venue and its fantastic owners, Stephanie and Paul. If you a...

re looking for an outdoor wedding venue this is a beautiful option and you owe it to yourself to check it out. Below is a bit about the place and why we felt it stood out amongst the venues we looked at. The setting: GOCF is an organic farm off the Pacific Coast Highway, just south of Pescadero and the Pigeon Point Lighthouse. You come up a dirt road, past another beautiful farm and gaining some elevation along the way. The farm has many areas available for your use (at your discretion, and included), with a delightful garden among them. We primarily used the event meadow and ceremony terrace. The ceremony terrace sits at the top of the property looking out over the small valley and some majestic trees with the ocean visible in the distance. The event meadow is below. It is a large open space with a dance floor, some decorative landscaping, a fire pit, and an outdoor kitchen. The things that make this venue stand out, beyond the beautiful setting: 1.) The owners are very sweet people, easy going and happy to help - they are personally invested in the success of your wedding. They also have some vendor recommendations to help you get going - but the choice is yours (unlike some places we looked at). 2.) The property includes multiple locations where you might do your ceremony, take your pictures, or hold cocktail hours/receptions. The choice is yours - they are all included, you need only specify what you would like to do. 3.) The venue can easily accommodate a large crowd - but a smaller wedding such as we had can feel intimate and comfortable. It’s all in how you choose to use the space. Again, you have kind of a blank slate in that regard. 4.) Your rental includes multiple days over the weekend, which makes setup and cleanup a lot easier. 5.) The venue has some cabins available for lodging (extra fee) and some camping sites available as well. 6.) We found the rental fee to be a very good value.

My husband and I had our wedding and reception (as well as a Friday night welcome bbq) at Green Oaks Creek Farm last month, in June 2022. The venue couldn't be in a more gorgeous s...

etting and Stephanie was wonderful to work with from beginning to end. So many of our guests commented on how awe-inspiring the location was--with its ocean views, fields of flowers, and trees--and we couldn't agree more. The improvements that Stephanie and Paul have made in their post-fire rebuild were wonderful additions to our wedding festivities, including the dance floor, gorgeous stone firepit, string lighting, outdoor kitchen, and camping area. We were glad that there was on-site lodging available, too, as it made getting ready for the wedding easier and provided a good "home base" for us during the weekend. We've always loved this stretch of coastline and Green Oaks Creek Farm is now an extra special place for us to return to in the years to come!
