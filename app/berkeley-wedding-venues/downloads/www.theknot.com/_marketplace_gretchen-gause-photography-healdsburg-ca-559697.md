Gretchen Gause

Owner / Photographer

Wedding days are such precious crowns of tenderness and hope. They bring people together that might otherwise never see one another. They can build bridges and mend broken hearts. I want the experience for you, of spreading out your images, picking each up and being reminded of that moment's joy and the people you shared it with over and over again. I photograph weddings because when memories fade, as they eventually do, what you have left are the photographs; physical, celebratory and lasting evidence of what was a magnificent coming together. Wedding days are for laughter and promises and gathering and they are an example of all things good in the world. If that's not worth documenting with full heart I don't know what is. Outside of my photography, I love spending time listening to books from sci-fi to memoirs and podcasts from Obitchuary to Making Sense. Dinner parties with family, friends & delicious wine are my favorite; a dance night out dressed in my highest heels and a week in the playa dust of Black Rock City run close seconds. Between the big moments are all of the smaller, most important, tender moments; listening to stories by Hazel & Dorian, hugging my people, being a shoulder, holding hands & cuddling my dog.

The absolute BEST! We hired Gretchen for our wedding this September and are so grateful we did. Like other reviews note, Gretchen is a breath of fresh air. She is low stress, ada...

ptable, polite, mindful, and thoughtful. She built instant rapport with us and eased our stress throughout the day. She made us so comfortable in front of the camera and gave clear direction when needed, but let us be ourselves. And then there is her talent! She completely "gets it" and took photos that felt like us while also capturing us at our best. We ended up with photos we love (and we haven't even seen all of them yet). Her style is candid and journalistic without being too much so- she has an eye for the special moments. She captured the vibe of our day in the best way!!

our photos turned out. Once we began our introductory Zoom call with Gretchen, it confirmed what we had already been feeling- we needed to lock her in for our date! Gretchen has strong communication skills and was easy to work with leading up to the wedding. We were immediately at ease knowing we had her coming! On the day of, Gretchen and her second shooter, Danielle, arrived early to get acclimated and were warm and friendly. My partner and I don't take a lot of photos of ourselves together and were pretty nervous about how we would pose and photograph in general, let alone with so much pressure on us on a special day. Gretchen and Danielle put us at such ease- the poses felt incredibly natural and the photographers blended in so well to our group we almost forgot we were being photographed. Our photos are truly magazine-worthy and we can't wait to enjoy them for years to come! Thank you so much, Gretchen Gause Photography!

Gretchen is a total dazzling gem in the intimidating world of choosing wedding vendors. We have nothing but accolades for this genius! My husband and I didn’t want stiff posed phot...

os for our wedding, and we admittedly have a very particular aesthetic that we thought would be hard to match. We scored big time finding Gretchen—a wildly talented photographer, warm, fun, and hilarious person, and an always calming presence during what has the potential to feel like an overwhelming event. She did our engagement and wedding photos, and both times she managed to turn our initially awkward and stiff reactions to the camera into an unbelievably gorgeous set of photos, capturing all the little authentic moments between our more awkward or contrived poses. She has a knack for capturing landscapes, finding the best backdrops for romantic photos that don’t feel forced. She was always warmly willing to humor us in our bizarre requests, like photographing us with our microscope. She has a way of making you forget that you’re being photographed and instead it feels like you’re hanging out with a fun friend. Her photos speak for themselves. We could not be happier with how they turned out, and we are endlessly grateful that we’ll be able to remember the special day with Gretchen’s art. Photos are a very special way to capture a once in a lifetime experience, and Gretchen is definitely the person you want on your team. We found her pricing so much more reasonable than many other photographers, and the quality of her photos much more I be like with what we were looking for. Gretchen places brilliant emphasis on the importance of kindness throughout her process. In an industry that can quickly feel material and cut throat, she brings such a refreshing and genuine perspective to the wedding world, focusing on the importance of love (while also giving plenty of space for her clients to embrace some inner diva 😊). We can’t recommend Gretchen enough and we are endlessly grateful we had the chance to work with her. Now we’re looking for more excuses to photograph events and work with her again!

rilled with how they turned out. It has been such a treat getting to work with her. The photos are BEAUTIFUL. Gretchen has an incredible eye, a really special use of light in her photos, and gave the perfect amount of direction (enough, but not too much). Her photos captured us and our guests in such a fun-yet-reverent-yet-also-emotion-filled way. She also managed to find time to capture stunning detail photos at our reception venue. She has a calming & fun demeanor - she put us at ease on both occasions. She and Danielle blended into the background at both the reception & the ceremony! Also, sort of a niche thing, but we got married at City Hall (a very symmetrical place) and Gretchen's photos were perfectly centered & aligned. No strange off-kilter backgrounds on Gretchen's watch! Logistics: Gretchen is organized, responsive, and punctual. She is an excellent communicator and was always the first of our vendors to reply & check in as important dates were approaching leading up to the engagement shoot & the wedding day. Gretchen also made sure to to arrive to our locations early to get a feel for the spaces & make sure she was prepared to capture them. During the planning process, she also provided excellent guidance and feedback on our timeline. Listen to Gretchen’s suggestions!! She’s right! After the two shoots, she delivered our galleries ahead of schedule and we are still just blown away with her talent and the results. Hire Gretchen!

n more I was drawn to her story and deeper purpose behind being a photographer. We were planning our wedding and I ached for my brother who I knew would not be there after passing away a few years prior. After reading Gretchen’s bio I knew our big day would be captured with genuine love as she too understood the bigger meaning behind a moment and a memory. And that was just the start to our amazing experience working with Gretchen and Danielle. They were professional from start to finish, but also SO KIND! I was more of a DIY bride and she guided me through everything from our timeline and photo lists to advice for minimize photo sessions so that we could spend more time with our guests. What I love most about Gretchen’s vision is that she focuses on true candid moments rather than awkward posed photos that we’ve all seen a million times before. The truth is, I wish I got to talk to her more at our wedding, but it’s proof they blended in so seamlessly that at times we forgot they were even there. They made us feel so natural and at ease, which allowed us to focus on our friends and family and soak in the moments all while knowing they were being beautifully captured. It has been 9 months since our wedding, and I'm still in awe of all the gorgeous photos! My family and I have gone through the collection many times, laughing and recapping what a spectacular day it was. We've already made a few photo books as gifts and they turned out beautifully. These photos will last us forever and I couldn’t imagine a better person to have been there on such a meaningful day. Thank you Gretchen, you are one of a kind and I am deeply grateful for everything!

commended from a friend for our destination wedding in Healdsburg. We first met her in 2019 to take our engagement photos in Marin. It was great to meet her and see her style in action. And on top of getting fantastic pictures, she was also very fun to spend time with. Fast forward to 2 covid date reschedules and we finally had our wedding in August 2022. Her skill at capturing our special moments really shines through. She shot our non-traditional "fun run" the morning of the wedding, as well as the wedding itself. Her photos are genuine, in the moment and give a real sense of the event, our guest experiences and how special the day really was (especially after a 2 year postponement). We will forever be thankful for these unique digital images.

nal she is, my now-husband and I immediately knew we wanted to work with her for our wedding (and engagement shoot). We didn't interview any other photographers because we didn't need to, and it was a great choice! She captured our wedding day beyond beautifully, and we will cherish her photos for years to come. Even a few things that I thought looked a little awkward in real life on the wedding day... she made them look beautiful in the photos, haha! A blessing! She also REALLY knows how to run things and work with other vendors to make the entire wedding smooth -- a true seasoned wedding pro. I felt like I could always go to her for advice about a lot of aspects about the wedding, even stuff beyond photography. Plus, she and her second shooter, Danielle, are a joy to work with and be around, which of course is so important for someone you're spending your wedding day with! It is impossible to overstate how strongly I recommend working with Gretchen!

I found Gretchen from a list of vendors shared with me from my dress shop. I was simply just browsing at the time but when I saw Gretchen's page I immediately filled out her questi...

onnaire to see if she had availability. I loved the real moments captured in her portfolio and knew I wanted a similar candid style. Gretchen makes it a point to get to know her clients, which really creates a comfortable setting for the day of. My husband and I can be awkward taking pictures so it was nice to be able to discuss that in advance and figure out a formal photo game plan that fit our priorities while still capturing all the essential photos. (Side note, listen to your photographers when they say 3 minutes per group formal photo, there's always someone missing.) Gretchen provides a teaser album shortly after the wedding and a full gallery later. Our teasers were amazing and provided us with plenty of photos to show to friends and family. We just received the gallery and WOW. The lighting is spectacular, there are tons of adorable candid moments of our guests, the detail photos really captured our day, and our formal photos are everything we could have dreamed of and more. Trust me, you won't regret booking her!

When reflecting on the experience of Gretchen, the words that come to mind are MAGICAL and WARMTH! Working with Gretchen was an absolute dream! From our first phone call, and eve...

ry single communication after that was deep, thoughtful, and warm. When my partner and I were looking for a photographer for our July 2020 wedding, we both wanted someone who captured a romanticism with a photojournalistic approach and someone who is warm, honest and embraced a level of vulnerability. Gretchen is all those things and more! When we stumbled across Gretchen's website, we were struck by and drawn to her level of vulnerability and depth. Her photos reflect honesty and intimacy that are true extensions of herself. When we spoke for the first time, it was clear that she was the right fit for us. She held our hands each step along the way, embraced an open partnership of collaboration, and honored our values. Each leg of communication was reflective and rich with kindness and integrity. On the day of, we felt held by the experience and a natural trust in her ability. Gretchen is like a ninja -- seamlessly weaving in and out of encounters effortlessly — A true professional! And, when we received our photos, we were blown away! My wife and I had to shift our plans because of COVID-19. We could not get married at the Berekely Botanical Gardens as planned and pivoted to an intimate backyard ceremony. We are so grateful that Gretchen was still able to photograph our day because she captured the most beautiful and intimate moments, exceeding our expectations despite the limitations and circumstances. Unequivocally, Gretchen is our photograph for LIFE!!! Mutually, we cannot wait for other milestones simply so we can be graced by the gifted and soulful nature of Gretchen's presence. Like others have said, HIRE HER — immediately if possible. You will be glad you did and feel enveloped by her warmth and talent. PFL — Photographer for life <3

After our first intro call, Gretchen's kindness, warmth, and genuine interest in our relationship, values, and love story sealed the deal. Her approach is not staged or posed, instead she seeks to capture you and your partner's love in its truest, most organic form. She strikes the perfect balance of active coaching (e.g. catching the right lighting, framing the shot) and blending into the background. She was also super flexible and up for anything, expertly finding and capturing amazing vignettes at an unfamiliar location (SF Botanical Gardens). Gretchen made our elopement so so special and we cannot wait to have her shoot our big wedding next year as well!

Not only is Gretchen's pricing reasonable, it's worth every penny and more.

n in the wedding photography scene. From the first e-mail, to numerous phone calls and endless questions we asked, Gretchen was warm, genuine and like an old friend ready to help and guide us every step of the way. On the big day, she was able to help my husband and I stay focused on each other while she took care of the timeline and details. Gretchen was able to tell the story of our wedding day from start to finish the way that our guests and we remember it: lively, joyous and full of love. Every photo was exactly how we pictured it and so much more! A candid moment caught in time exuding so much emotion and intimacy - that's what every photo showed. She didn't miss a thing and even caught some surprise moments! Our first date was at a Starbucks in San Francisco, and Gretchen snapped a few shots of us walking in front of one (we didn't even know - thank you for this gem!). There are so many wonderful things to say about Gretchen and could go on and on forever. Having her on our side for the wedding day is something we won't forget or ever regret. We hope to work with Gretchen again in the future for other milestones!

eeing my friend's beautiful wedding photos). We first met Gretchen in person for our Couple's Session, which my husband and I were both totally freaked out about, not ever having professional photos done before. Gretchen was AMAZING at making us feel comfortable, guiding us ever so slightly but still capturing our natural movements and affection with each other. She was so sweet, kind, professional, and truly an artist and it showed in the photos. Now the wedding is really where our jaws literally dropped to the floor. Not only was she an absolute JOY to have around all day, and super helpful with misc. items (like calling out a wrinkle in my dress I missed, or ordering us gals more champagne), but she just executed on her/our vision flawlessly. All family and bridal party photos were a breeze, and after that we barley noticed her! Besides getting pulled for sunset photos, which I am eternally grateful for as those are some of my favorite photos of the day, she let us enjoy our moments with our guests and each other. When we received our photos, my husband and I were blown away! Our cheeks hurt from smiling for the two hours we spent looking through the photos - she captured everything perfectly. The vibe, the colors, the warmth - I could see each happy moment in the pictures being played out in my mind exactly how I remembered it. Bottom line, Gretchen is a class act and her photos will make you weep with happiness. I can't wait to hire her again for family photos some day!

have to capture the emotion and memories of the day, and it's the photos that will stay with you for years to come. I was so tired of seeing overdone boring "wedding photography" that as soon as I saw Gretchen's work I was in love. Gretchen's photography is so beautiful: perfectly composed, beautiful use of light, and above all she is able to capture emotion and interaction in such a natural way. She is such a joy to have by your side on your wedding day. Whoever you hire as a photographer is going to be with you A LOT so this is super important. She has such a calm, wise & thoughtful presence that not only didn't distract, but added to the feeling of the day. Looking through our wedding photos for the first time with my new husband (!) was like re-living that day in the most beautiful way, and living for the first time all the moments she captured that we missed. She really gave us a gift that we'll treasure forever. These are now my absolute favorite photos of myself, my husband, and my family. We feel so lucky to have worked with Gretchen, and now we're always trying to think of opportunities to be able to work with her again :)

Perhaps what I loved and appreciated most about working with her was that she was opinionated (that’s why I hired her)— suggesting settings and poses and helping my husband and I look our best, while still feeling like us.

Instagram. Stereotypical shots that are supposed to represent the happiest days in people’s lives but they all seemed lifeless. Then we found Gretchen. Her photos had an editorial Vibe to them that seemed to capture exact moments in time. THAT is what you look for not only in a wedding photographer but in someone who is a TRUE PHOTOGRAPHER. Gretchen truly has a gift in what she does and I’m certain that if she were to venture out of wedding photography she would also find tremendous success. She was an absolute pleasure to work with and we can’t say enough good things about her.

When we saw Gretchen’s work during our research, we instantly knew she was the one that we wanted to work with. She captures so much emotion and makes you feel as though you’re there, experiencing the moment that is happening in her photos. On our wedding day, she made us feel so unbelievably comfortable. Neither of us had ever taken a professional photo in our lives, and both consider ourselves to be quite awkward. Gretchen and her wonderful assistant Danielle made everything seem so natural and it reflected in every photo. They turned out better than imagined and I cannot thank her enough for capturing this day for us so beautifully and leaving us lasting memories that we can pore over for years to come.

he pictures I first saw of hers were featured in The Knot magazine). Gretchen is easy to work with, professional, and her photos have a certain warmth to them. She is excellent at understanding timing (I used her recommendations to time the rest of my wedding activities), and she got plenty of photos of my guests, too, which was so cool, because as the bride, you don't necessarily get to see all the action while you are gone taking photos. I am also not very photogenic, so I was surprised that there were dozens of excellent shots of me and my hubby...for once, I actually enjoyed sharing the pictures with people. But the best part of her photography is how she captures emotions, and her ability to choose great locations. She was able to convince the venue to let us take the golf cart to a close-by trial that they usually don't go to. I was really grateful for that! I would hire her and her team again in a heartbeat!

She has an energy that is so passionate and calming at the same time, and she makes you feel comfortable and relaxed even if you’ve never taken professional photos together (like me and my husband). She has an unbelievable talent for using the natural light and shadows and the surrounding areas to complement each frame. I cannot even express in words what a special gift she has! When we got our photos, I stayed up all night looking at them over and over again, crying over how amazing they are (and I NEVER cry)!

From when we hired her to the day of the wedding, she took time to get to know us, listen to what we were looking for, and quickly responded to our inquiries, especially when it looked like rain would change our entire shoot. We were impressed by her professionalism and warmth, and she is extremely easy to work with. We received our photos in a timely fashion, and we could not be happier with the results. In searching for photographers, we were extremely wary of our images looking too posed, too saturated, too saccharine and corny; Gretchen took great care to make our photos look natural, candid, and almost ethereal.

Gretchen is absolutely one of the SWEETEST people you will ever meet, yet also has the assertiveness and capability of having kept my wedding party, as well as myself and the groom :), in check and making sure photos were taken in a timely manner. I even had my other vendors (videographer/coordinator/etc.) telling me "wow, your photographer definitely knows what she's doing!". Her professionalism is perfection, and her work speaks for itself when you truly are able to feel the emotions looking back at each photo.

When we had to change our venue last minute due to the fires in Sonoma, she was willing to travel to the city for our day, even though she herself was personally affected by the fires AND make the most of small spaces and busy city streets. Gretchen has an ease about her that makes those of us who are camera shy feel comfortable. We received our photos last week and we are in absolute awe. We keep reliving our day through these incredible images. I could not be more happy with our decision to work with Gretchen.

nd required patience from everyone involved. I felt so badly that your wedding day was caught in the mix but you, your families and friends were all so incredibly graceful through the process. You are what made the day flow so beautifully and make everyone feel as though the wedding had always been planned to be in SF! It was an absolute pleasure working with you! THANK YOU!

I'm currently trying to decide on the top 200 photos from our wedding. It is so difficult and my husband and I have spent weeks trying, but scrolling through our album is such a jo...

yful experience. I figured now is a great time to thank the woman who blessed us this with challenge. Oh, Gretchen. Gretchen is incredible. She is truly talented as a photographer, but beyond that, she is an amazing human being. When searching for a photographer, my fiancé and I met with numerous options. I wanted something more than happy go lucky average Instagram photos. I tried to describe the photos I wanted to a photographer, and she actually told me to check our Gretchen. I browsed her Instagram and it was love at first sight. Her photos are real, raw, emotional, artistic, and beautiful. We did the engagement photos and we both had a blast, and loved the photos. The wedding photos were perfect. Absolutely perfect. If you look at Gretchen's work and like it, if you like the way it makes you feel, and if it makes you smile and swoon and sometimes cry, call Gretchen. It was the best wedding decision we made. She is genuine, open, and oh so talented. Thank you Gretchen, from the bottom of my heart, for providing us two collections of photographs we will cherish for a lifetime.

Finding vendors for your wedding is a lot of work and often an incredibly difficult decision. That wasn't the case for us with Gretchen- I knew I wanted her the second I came acro...

ss her website. In fact, we sent in our retainer check after our first email, without meeting her or even a phone call, because we were that certain and didn't want to risk loosing her to someone else. I have to say, this easy decision was also one of the best we made in the entire wedding planning process. Working with Gretchen was just as easy- it really felt more like a close friend was taking our photos. She was amazing at making us feel comfortable but also keeping the entire day on track and moving smoothly. As for the photos themselves, to say they are beautiful would be a complete understatement. I didn't think it was possible to recreate the love and magic I felt that day, but there it was again right before my eyes. I looked through all the photos 4 or 5 times immediately upon receiving them and just cried tears of joy the entire time. The day of the wedding went by so fast that in a way it felt like a beautiful blur, but seeing these photos I was transported back to specific moments of love and emotion, and that fuzzy blur ironed itself out into a collection of absolutely amazing memories I know I will never forget- and thanks to Gretchen's photos, never have to. Gretchen- from the bottom of my heart, thank you for your raw talent, your big heart and for capturing a love 20+ years in the making <3

I've been waiting anxiously to write Gretchen's review. I hadn't gotten my photos yet, but wanted to write one anyways because her calming, organized, FUN, and beautiful presence o...

n the day of our wedding was enough for me to sing her praises. She created a calm and celebratory environment, even in spite of a scattered family and slightly-buzzed bridal party. But it didn't feel honest to write a review before I got my images ... well, we received our photos yesterday and I am SPEECHLESS. I didn't think that the other-worldly kind of joy I felt on my wedding day could possibly translate into photographs, but Gretchen somehow pulled it off. Our pictures are genuine, candid, organic, and clearly the product of an artist who has the patience and vision to capture the perfect moments. I wasn't convinced that I even cared about pictures on the day of our wedding, but now they're the most precious thing I own. The only thing I would differently would be to invest in the largest package possible with Gretchen, so I could've captured every moment of our wedding weekend. Gretchen is incredible - both as an artist and a person. Other than saying "I Do", choosing Gretchen to be our photographer was the best decision I made on our wedding day.

Gretchen Gause = THE.BEST.EVER Before we were referred to Gretchen, we were thinking about not even doing a photographer and just doing a custom video short of the day. We rational...

ized our choice with thoughts like: Who even looks at their wedding photos anyway? Why spend all that money for something that is just going to collect dust on your bookcase? Who needs 1k pictures when you're only going to hang 3 or 4 up in your house? After looking at her website and the couples featured, I immediately noticed her amazing ability to pull the beauty and love of her clients through to the image. I loved that she featured a diverse set of clients. After speaking via email and on a couple calls we were sold on working with her and completely trusted her to capture our special day. After an amazing wedding day and Gretchen's talent, I can answer all of those above questions with confidence. Who even looks at their wedding photos anyway? I do! They are the background to my Apple TV so also anyone that comes over to my house. I also show them to people that are looking for a photographer for weddings, even if they are out of the area. I say, find you a photographer that can do this (showing the photo) with all of this (hand in a circular motion in front of my face). Why spend all that money for something that is just going to collect dust on your bookcase? I would do it again in a heartbeat. Who needs 1k pictures when you're only going to hang 3 or 4 up in your house? I do! I need all 1019 of my photos. They are ALL AMAZING!! Literally not a bad one in the batch. I love them all, which is why it's so hard to decide which to frame. Maybe I will just make a wall paper out of them all.

When I first started browsing Gretchen's website while planning our wedding 4 years ago, I was instantly awestruck by her intensely emotional story-telling. To be honest, I welled...

up imagining what our wedding could look like in photos and knew she was the right person for the job. We booked Gretchen right away and ever since I have recommended her to people both personally and professionally. Guess what- they all booked her too! Aside from insanely gorgeous wedding photos, we were so blessed to have Gretchen's support and friendship throughout the planning and execution of such a dauntingly detailed day. Her ability to keep things on schedule, while keeping the mood light was incredible. Not only did we have the portraits we needed, we have incredible images of each detail at each of the *two* venues, and all the little moments in between. The candid shots of our families and friends are cherished as much as the ceremony procession. I can't stress how important it was for us to have her with us the entire day, and it was worth every penny. When we think back on our wedding day, it wasn't just about us. It was about each person in our life that has helped us grow and stay together, and each person who helped create a celebration that honored our community and our union. Gretchen not only provided us with an amazing album of images that truly told the story of our day, but gave us sanity and laughter throughout it all. She is more than just s great photographer, and in the wedding business that means a lot! Book her before it's too late!!
