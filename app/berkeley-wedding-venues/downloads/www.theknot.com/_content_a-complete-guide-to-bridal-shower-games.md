## Fun Bridal Shower Games

Motivate your guests to get out of their seats and move around the party with some of the best bridal shower games. From bingo to prosecco pong, we have it all.

### 1\. Bridal Shower Bingo

![Bridal shower bingo game](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/909b5160-3c6a-40d8-8be6-3eb383ad0efc~rs_768.h-cr_159.0.1429.1270)

It's bingo, bridal shower style. This printable [bridal shower bingo](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-shower-bingo) card is trendy and includes blank squares for you to fill in answers inspired by your guests. Follow traditional bingo rules: The first guest to mark off a line horizontally, vertically or diagonally wins a prize.

[$3 | Etsy](https://tidd.ly/3HlJysL)

### 2\. The Lingerie Bridal Shower Game

![Lingerie bridal shower game](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/3e3aeab6-99de-45db-83b0-94e012646585~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1080.1080)

On your [lingerie bridal shower](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-to-throw-lingerie-shower) invites, ask each guest to bring the bride a pair of panties that matches their personality and style. Blindfold the bride (or briefly send her to another room) while you hang the items on a makeshift clothesline using cute decorative hangers. Once everything is set up, have the bride go around the room and guess who each gift is from. At the end of the day, the bride-to-be goes home with a new lingerie wardrobe (perfect to bring on the honeymoon).

[$9 | Zazzle](https://www.zazzle.com/watercolor_lace_lingerie_panty_game_bridal_shower_enclosure_card-256660124912939686)

Hosting a ["Petals and Prosecco" bridal shower](https://www.theknot.com/content/petals-prosecco-bridal-shower)? Here's a game that will tie your theme together. Prosecco pong is played just like beer pong, only for this rendition of the game, you get to sip prosecco and toss pretty pink balls into coupe glasses.

[$28 | Etsy](https://tidd.ly/45wBSf3)

### 4\. "What's the Tea" Bridal Shower Game

![What's the tea bridal shower game](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/6716284e-ce71-47a9-a9c9-b4ad9d915ba3~rs_768.h-cr_22.0.678.875)

![Ring collection bridal shower game](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/3cf6acc5-e8fe-4c3f-94c8-d7b9c33234ad~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1080.1080)

_Photo: Zazzle_

The ring collection game is one of the most quintessential shower games for bridal events. Here's how to play: Present each guest with a plastic ring to wear at the start of the party. Pick one wedding-related word guests can't speak, like "bride," "love" or "wedding." If a guest overhears someone else saying the forbidden word, they can take that guest's ring. The winner is the person with the most rings at the end of the party.

[$13 | Zazzle](https://www.zazzle.com/red_and_pink_bridal_shower_ring_game_pedestal_sign-256214736602283810)

### 6\. Pass the Bouquet Bridal Shower Game Idea

![Pass the bouquet bridal shower game](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/77b7ecf7-9226-4d57-9dca-1a7c4fde6d77~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1500.2000)

This bridal shower game for large groups is a fun twist on musical chairs, using a floral bouquet instead of seats. You'll need a bouquet, a playlist and speakers. Ask your guests to sit or stand in a circle. Start the music and have them pass the bouquet around. When the music stops, the person holding the bouquet is eliminated. The last person standing (or sitting) wins.

[$22 | Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09PQHN3Y4/?tag=tkcommerce-218-20&th=1)

### 7\. Wedding Shoe Game

![Wedding shoe game for bridal shower ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/0b3aa5a3-f7e8-461c-bf75-3c6cfa0bfd25~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1080.1080)

_Photo: Zazzle_

This popular wedding reception game can also be played at a couple's wedding shower. Unlike the other game ideas for a bridal shower on this list, the [wedding shoe game](https://www.theknot.com/content/shoe-game-wedding-reception-game-questions) puts the spotlight on the couple, so the guests can get to know the to-be-weds a little better. Brainstorm 15 or 20 funny questions starting with "Who," such as "Who's more likely to steal all the covers on a cold night?" You'll also need two chairs for the couple to sit in. Instead of holding each other's shoes, give them two paddles—one with "Mr." and the other with "Mrs.". The host asks the questions, and the to-be-weds answer by raising their chosen paddle.

[$31 | Zazzle](https://www.zazzle.com/mr_or_mrs_pink_glitter_and_black_wedding_game_hand_fan-256364336637035959)

### 8\. "Passing the Phone" Bridal Shower Game

![Passing the phone bridal shower game ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/bed69438-8437-4f1f-9eec-c546c27d0668~rs_768.h-cr_0.22.1920.1462)

Did you know that [audio guest books](https://www.theknot.com/content/audio-guest-book) aren't only for the big day? That's right. There are plenty of wedding shower games that involve using services like After the Tone. Here's one that we love: Have guests take turns recording a funny message about someone at the party, before passing the phone to them to do the same. They could say something like, "I'm passing the phone to someone who I think will get the drunkest at the bachelorette party" before handing the phone to that person. At the end of the party, you can play the recording and have a good laugh! **Psst: Take 15% off your purchase with our exclusive code KNOT15.**

### 9\. "Who Has the Groom Or Bride?" Bridal Shower Game

!["Who has the groom or bride" bridal shower game](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/a03a2bb6-e272-400e-b440-939154140d9d~rs_768.h-cr_0.39.1588.1230)

The guest of honor and partygoers will crack up when they scratch off these cards to reveal famous grooms and brides. The cards are customizable so you can add a picture of the _real_ groom or bride on one lucky guest's card.

### 10\. Bridal Shower Bake-Off

![Bridal shower bake-off game](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/cb45cfa3-96c6-4884-af56-45b08adcc021~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.600.600)

_Photo: Personalization Mall_

One of our favorite interactive bridal shower games on our list, this activity is best for small groups where the event will be at someone's home. Give out aprons, which help guests keep their clothes clean and act as party favors, and task them with making and decorating delicious cupcakes for the bride. You can split people up as individuals or into teams. (We suggest getting cupcake mix to make the process quicker and easier.) Once everyone has finished, the bride acts as the judge and determines who wins the bridal shower bake-off. Consider adding suspenseful music and making it a timed event to add more competitive spirit.

## Funny Bridal Shower Games

If your goal is to show the guests a good time, try one of these silly bridal shower games that'll make everyone laugh until they cry. Get ready to fill this prewedding event with laughter.

### 11\. Make a Wedding Dress Bridal Shower Game

You won't stop laughing while playing this bridal shower game. To start, you'll need lots of rolls of toilet paper. Spice it up by purchasing markers, stickers or glitter. Divide groups into teams of at least three people. One team member will be the model. The other team members will make a wedding dress from toilet paper and other decorating supplies. Set a timer for 15 minutes—when time's up, the bride-to-be chooses her winner.

### 12\. Pin the Veil on the Bride

Here's the classic Pin the Tail on the Donkey game all grown up. Print out a large photo of the bride and put it on one of the venue's walls. Use bandanas, masks or ask guests to close their eyes (the honor system comes into play here) to blindfold guests so they can attempt to pin a faux veil, which can be made from any lace, cotton or nylon material, onto the right spot on the bride's photo.

### 13\. Hot Gossip Bridal Shower Game Idea

Think of this activity as a live game of Clue. For each guest attending the shower, write a juicy question revealing how they know the couple on index cards. (Example: Who did Sasha bring to the prom?) When everyone arrives, hand them a card—but not the card about themselves—and start the clock (30 minutes to an hour). This gives guests plenty of time to come up with the answer to the question on their given card. After swapping info and mingling, each person reveals their relationship to the to-be-weds.

### 14\. Couple Roast Interactive Bridal Shower Game

If you're hosting a [couples shower](https://www.theknot.com/content/couple-bridal-shower-basics), this is one of the most hilarious wedding shower games that'll have everyone in a laughing mood. The couple judges their guests as to how well they're able to act like them. Cut paper into strips and write descriptions of scenarios from the couple's past or future on each one––for example, "John and Jane get lost in Ikea." Guests break into two teams, draw from the strips of paper and designate two people to be the actors. Each group gets five minutes to act out the scenario in front of the couple. Once the five minutes are up, the couple uses their scorecards to judge the act from one to 10 based on acting chops and accuracy.

### 15\. Bridal Shower Pictionary

In a bowl, place slips of paper with different wedding-related phrases written on them––like, "tossing the bouquet," "going to the chapel" or "[cutting the cake](https://www.theknot.com/content/cutting-the-cake)"). Divide the group into two teams and nominate a starting artist for the first team. Have them pull a phrase from the bowl and set a timer for 60 seconds. If their team can't guess the answer before time is up, the other team gets a chance. The winning team is the first to correctly guess 10 phrases. This convenient bundle of whiteboards and markers comes with supplies for 12 people.

### 16\. "Who Am I?" Wedding Shower Game

The premise of this funny bridal shower game is to put the name of a famous person on each guest's forehead or back—actor, musician, politician, sports personality or historical figure. Guests circulate the room for about 15 minutes asking "yes" or "no" questions to each other, slowly trying to guess the name that's written on their sticky note.

### 17\. Wedding Movie Charades Bridal Shower Game

Looking for [bridal shower ideas on a budget](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-shower-ideas-on-a-budget)? Label note cards with [wedding movies](https://www.theknot.com/content/best-wedding-movies) (include classics, chick flicks and obscure picks for a good challenge). Divvy the group up into two teams. Players pick a card from the pile and act out a scene from that film without speaking a word while their team members try to guess the answers within a three-minute time limit.

### 18\. Etiquette 911 Bridal Shower Game Idea

Have guests answer extreme (read: humorous) [wedding etiquette](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-rules-you-can-break) questions. Write out a few wedding etiquette questions—the more outrageous, the better. Think of some nuptial nightmares, like what do you do if the best man sprays champagne all over the guests? Or what happens if you accidentally knock into the wedding cake? Give a scenario to each guest and have them write down their response to the situation. Then, have the bridal party gather all the cards and read the questions and answers aloud.

### 19\. Veil Crafting Game

![Veil crafting game for bridal shower](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/d0d7f224-78e4-4f1a-9120-434f59cf8fa4~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.500.500)

_Photo: Amazon_

Time to ask your guests to put their creative caps on. Buy simple tulle veils, faux pearls, rhinestones, lace, glue and more so guests can compete to make the best veil for the bride. After 30 minutes, guests can showcase their veils to the bride, who has to choose one as the winner. An alternative ending is that the bride can bring some of the veils to their bach trip and wear them during their weekend for an extra sentimental touch.

[$9 | Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Bridal-Womens-Simple-Wedding-Bachelorette/dp/B07GX9DX1Q/ref=sr_1_10?tag=tkcommerce-218-20)

### 20\. Wedding _Jeopardy!_

![Dry erase markers and cards from Amazon for your bridal shower games](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/dc2925ad-77ea-4c77-8ee6-b0f3bccdff08~rs_768.h-cr_34.26.2527.1896)

Ever heard of [bridal Jeopardy](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-jeopardy-questions)? Guests choose from wedding-related categories and answer questions to win points. Recreate a Jeopardy! screen with categories across the top (like wedding knowledge or the bride's favorite things) and value points going down each column. Come up with easy, medium and challenging questions for each category, like "Where did the couple go on their first date?" Each person gets a turn to pick a category and points level. After the question is read aloud, guests have one minute to write their answers on their game cards (we suggest dry-erase boards or cards you can reuse). When the timer rings, everyone must put their pens down and show their answers. Award points for each correct answer and tally them up at the end.

## Unique Bridal Shower Games

These out-of-the-ordinary bridal shower games are perfect for the clever and chatty bunch. These are playful activities your guests probably haven't seen before.

### 21\. Jewelry Making Competition

![Jewelry making competition bridal shower game](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/5201532e-90a6-462a-b879-8037f6d75b44~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1600.2133)

For those who love crafting, this bridal shower game idea is perfect for you. Buy a curated batch of high-quality beads and jewelry supplies that fit the event's theme. Make it competitive by asking guests to create necklaces, bracelets or earrings using the materials provided in one hour. Whichever piece of jewelry the bride likes the best is the winner, but no one truly loses because the craft acts as a party favor too.

[$35 | BaubleBar](https://baublebar.pxf.io/PONzre)

### 22\. Bridal Bouquet Competition

A bridal bouquet competition is one of the best easy games for bridal showers because it has minimal supplies. Get assorted colors of tissue paper, ribbons and pipe cleaners and clear tape and you're ready to go. Encourage guests to make a tissue paper bouquet that fits the [bridal shower's theme](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-shower-themes) and whoever impresses the bride the most wins a prize.

### 23\. Wedding Bartending Competition

Cool bridal shower games are crucial to having an upbeat affair and having a bartending competition is what you need to achieve that. A stocked bar and cocktail tool sets are all you need. Depending on the amount of attendants, each person can be their own team or you can divide everyone into teams of two or three. Task guests with making delicious and innovative cocktails or mocktails they came up with on the spot or beverages they know and love by heart. After everyone has made their drinks, the bride can taste each one and determine the winner. Want to add another element to get guests excited? Ask if the bride-to-be is okay with putting the winner's creation (or a version of it) on their menu as a [signature drink](https://www.theknot.com/content/your-ultimate-signature-cocktail-finder).

### 24\. Taste the Cake Wedding Shower Game Idea

![Taste the Cake Amazon game for your bridal shower](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/d4c99c7b-67ee-4367-8ba7-4fcca074b0c7~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1600.1600)

[Feed your bridal shower guests](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-shower-food-ideas) in a fun way. Set up a cake bar (or individual plates) with bite-size cakes, cupcakes or cookies in various flavors. Each player is blindfolded and samples one flavor at a time, sharing their guess for each. Whoever guesses the most flavors correctly wins. Swap basic blindfolds with stylish satin sleep masks that double as bridal shower favors.

### 25\. Card Book Keepsake

![Card book keepsake bridal shower game](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/5cfa6141-d713-49d5-aa42-7690936770d1~rs_768.h-cr_34.0.742.708)

_Photo: Cards by Artkive_

Yes, technically this isn't a bridal shower game but this can be a creative activity for guests. Instead of all the lovely bridal shower cards the bride-to-be receives getting misplaced or stored somewhere to never be seen again, buy a card book. Get arts and crafts supplies so guests can make their bridal shower cards at the celebration then collect them at the end of the party. Send as many cards you can fit into the custom box because those will be included in the card book for the bride to cherish for years to come. We love that the cards are photographed and edited by pros and you get a final say over the book's look before you give it as a gift to the bride-to-be.

[$119 | Cards by Artkive](https://www.cardsbyartkive.com/greeting-cards-memory-books)

### 26\. Celebrity Name Game

![Celebrity name game for bridal shower](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/e3cb3bd2-2eb9-49b0-a3e1-19f54a3c2b7e~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1140.855)

_Photo: FestiveGal_

For this unique bridal shower game, ask guests to write a celebrity's name on a small piece of paper and place it in a bowl (in this case, we suggest you use a cute cowgirl hat that doubles as a gift for the bride). Aim for at least 10 or 20 slips of paper and split guests into two teams. The first player from Team A draws a name, stands up and tries to explain the celebrity to her teammates without actually saying their name. If teammates guess correctly, the second player draws a new name. Each team has one minute to get through as many names as possible until all the names are out of the hat.

### 27\. Play-Doh Spouse Game

Buy a pack of Play-Doh with assorted colors and take older guests back to their childhood and put young guests into a playful mindset. Print different pictures of the bride's spouse for each table and tell guests to recreate the image with the Play-Doh. This game doesn't have to have any winners or losers, instead, it can be an easy and fun way to keep guests entertained during different points of the celebration.

### 28\. Memory Lane Game for a Bridal Shower

![Memory lane bridal shower game](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/398d606c-42eb-43a1-adf8-4442f9362704~rs_768.h-cr_0.37.1500.1162)

_Photo: Amazon_

Hand out index cards and have each guest write a description of their favorite memory with the bride—the more adventurous and unique, the better, but depending on the crowd, you may want to keep things PG-friendly. After collecting the cards, the host reads each memory out loud and guests guess who did what with the bride.

![Pass the Love Story wedding shower game](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/7d871ecc-57e2-497a-bf5e-2dad12881856~rs_768.h)

_Photo: Amazon_

Each guest gets a chance to exaggerate the story of how the couple met and fell in love. The host starts by writing a line at the top of the paper about how the couple met. For example, "Tess and Monica met at the office." She then passes the paper to the next player, who writes a line to follow that one. Once that player writes their line, their job is to fold the paper over so only their sentence is revealed to the next player. After everyone has contributed, the guest of honor should read the final piece aloud to the group. We like the idea of writing everything in a cute journal the bride can take home as a party keepsake (and a funny reminder).

Just like the famous game show, [The Newlywed Game](https://www.theknot.com/content/newlywed-game-questions) puts the to-be-wed in the hot seat to answer questions about their relationship and see how their answers compare. Interview the bride's partner ahead of time to get answers to questions, like "Where was your first kiss?" or "What's her go-to coffee order?" At the bridal shower, ask the bride the same questions and see if she can answer correctly. To get the full effect, record a video of her partner's answers and play back the responses to each question for everyone to see and hear.

Couples wedding shower games can be productive activities too. You'll need two clipboards, pens and paper. Tell the group they're going to help write the couple's wedding vows. Circulate two clipboards: one with the header "I [insert name] take you [insert name] and promise to" and the other with the reverse. Give each clipboard to one guest and instruct them to write a sentence under the header. For example, "I promise to…not hog the shower in the morning." Once one guest has written their vow, they must fold over the paper to hide their answer, and pass it to the second player. Once everyone has contributed to both clipboards, read the vows out loud for the group.

## Bridal Shower Game FAQ

Even though you've probably decided what you want to play and where to buy your bridal shower games, you still might have some questions. Keep reading to get the quick and concise answers you need.

### Do you have to play games at a bridal shower?

No, you don't have to play games at the bridal shower. We get it. Not everyone is into playing games and explaining (sometimes long-winded) rules. So don't be afraid to ditch the tradition if the bride isn't into the idea of playing games during the bridal shower.

### How many games should you play at a bridal shower?

The length of the bridal shower determines how many games "should" be played. We suggest having at least two and a maximum of five games that vary in skill level.

### What can you do at a bridal shower besides games?

There are plenty of bridal shower activities that don't involve games. Consider booking a [photo booth rental](https://www.theknot.com/content/tips-to-book-your-photo-booth), having a beaded bracelet bar or hiring entertainment (why not have an impersonator of the bride's favorite artist?) to keep the bride and partygoers busy and having fun.
