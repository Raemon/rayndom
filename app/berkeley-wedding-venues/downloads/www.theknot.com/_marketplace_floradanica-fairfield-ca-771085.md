To many, a wedding is the climax of lifelong dreams and fantasy. There are tremendous expectations visualized within the mind that are rarely conveyed in words. My daughter, Yasmin...

, and her, now husband, John had such a dream. We were extremely ignorant of how to florally express all of their visions. Thankfully, Floradanica had the wisdom, botanical knowledge, and expertise to actualize and exceed expectations to create everything that Yasmin and John imagined. Equipped with only a selection of colors, some significant tidbits, and a limited budget, Floradanica delivered fresh and elegant floral arrangements and bouquets that brought enchantment to the event. Professionally, Floradanica's customer service is top tier. Annelise listens to the clients and tailors the arrangement to the client's esthetic. Annelise is an outstanding communicator. She shared her recommendations, with words and photos with tremendous support for the couple. She eliminated the stress of insecurity regarding the floral aspect of the event. We were at ease and completely confident with her services. The wedding was absolutely stunning! I have no hesitation in recommending Floradanica to decorate any event.

I’ve worked with Floridanica on many occasions. Annelise is professional, patient and oh so talented! Guests were talking about her flowers for weeks after the bridal shower!

My husband and I eloped to Hawaii and planned to host a Happily Ever After Party with our family and friends afterwards. I reached out to Floradanica about creating our reception ...

centerpieces. During my consultation, Annelise listened to my wants and what I envisioned. She was really great in incorporating my favorite color and my request to include some tropical elements. Her creation was absolutely stunning. Using the same color scheme, Annelise also created beautiful corsages for our moms, and boutonnieres for my husband and our dads. Last minute I added a flower headpiece and flowers to top our cake, and Annelise had no problem taking on my requests. Everything was beautiful! I would not hesitate to contact Annelise from Floradanica for your floral needs. She is so kind, professional, and very creative. She will work within your budget to make your event amazing!

s, flowers are pretty no matter the size of your center piece. Annelise made my small, simple centerpieces look like something out of a magazine!
