Details

Set the tone for an elegant reception with our refined wedding place cards. Each guest’s name is highlighted in classic serif typography and surrounded by foil-kissed flourishes. The looping accents offer a subtle hint of ornamentation, beautifully balanced by the clean layout.   
Select how many cards you would like printed and after you’ve placed your order, a designer will send you a spreadsheet to fill out your guests' names. After you’ve placed your order, send your completed spreadsheet to help@theknot.com with your order number included in your email, and a designer will send you a digital proof of all of your cards before printing.   
A variety of meal icons are now available! If you would like to include meal info on your place cards, simply enter your guests’ meal choices to your spreadsheet, ordered by meal preference - and our designers will include them in your digital proofs. 

**Size:** 3.5 x 5 inches
