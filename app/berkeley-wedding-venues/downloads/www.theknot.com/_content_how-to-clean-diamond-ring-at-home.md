## Can You Clean a Diamond Ring at Home? 

It's the golden question of fine jewelry. Can you clean a diamond engagement ring at home? The answer is yes! "Besides keeping your ring sparkly and bright, regular cleaning is also important to help maintain its integrity," says Christina Gandia Gambale, an expert gemologist and owner of [Greenwich St. Jewelers](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/greenwich-st-jewelers-new-york-ny-604915). "When you take the time to care for your ring, you will have more opportunities to notice if something is amiss, such as a loose stone, the ring being bent out of shape, or damage to the prongs."

The truth is that cleaning your engagement ring at home is not as complicated (or scary) as it seems. In fact, it's an essential way to [take proper care of your engagement ring](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-to-care-for-your-engagement-ring). You just need to make sure that you're gentle and patient during the cleaning process—if you're not careful, you could loosen the diamond or scratch the metal.

## How Often to Clean Your Engagement Ring at Home

You should clean your engagement ring at home every week to help maintain its brilliance and sparkle. You may not realize it, but many of your daily habits can quickly dull your ring's brilliant sparkle. Products like shampoo, hairspray, lotions, soaps and cooking oils can leave a cloudy sheen on the center stone and the band. But if the thought of scrubbing your bauble yourself makes you a bit nervous, there's no reason to be worried. "If you are cleaning a ring carefully, then you will not damage it," says Gambale. "You can and should feel confident about helping it look its best at all times."

In addition to frequently cleaning your diamond ring at home, consider bringing it to a jeweler for a professional deep cleaning twice a year. (Psst: Some [engagement ring insurance](https://www.theknot.com/content/engagement-ring-insurance-101) packages may include this in your policy.) Not only will their tools get those hard-to-reach spots underneath the setting that you can't with a brush, they can also tighten prongs and offer other upkeep services to keep your gemstone safe and secure. If you lead an active lifestyle or like to get your hands dirty with activities like gardening, you may want to get your ring professionally cleaned more often. 

## How to Clean a Diamond Ring at Home

The best way to clean a diamond ring at home is with soap and water. Fill a bowl with equal parts warm water and gentle dishwashing soap (Dawn is a great option) and soak your ring for at least 20 to 40 minutes—but the longer you let it sit, the cleaner it'll get. Use a soft-bristled toothbrush to gently scrub away buildup and grime. Rinse your ring thoroughly under warm running water and repeat if necessary.

While this process is safe for diamonds on any [engagement ring metal type](https://www.theknot.com/content/engagement-ring-metal-types), there are other methods you can use to clean specific materials. The best part? You probably already have these common products around your house.

### How to clean a white gold ring 

White gold is one of the most common engagement ring metals, so knowing its composition can help you clean it properly. White gold is an alloy made of pure gold and other metals like silver, palladium or nickel, coated in a rhodium plating to create its signature sheen (and to minimize yellow tints). However, its plating can erode over time, which can take away your ring's bright, lustrous appearance. 

The best way to clean a white gold engagement ring is to soak it regularly in warm water and dish soap. Pat it dry with a lint-free cloth, and when you aren't wearing it, store it in a jewelry box with fabric lining to minimize scratches. Since white gold's rhodium plating can be more susceptible to damage than other pure metals, it's best to avoid any harsh chemicals when cleaning this type of engagement ring at home. The same goes for rose gold engagement rings, too—since the rosy hue comes from an alloy of yellow gold and copper, we recommend sticking with warm water and dish soap to clean this metal type. 

### How to clean a yellow gold ring 

Like white gold, the best way to clean a solid gold engagement ring is with warm water and dish soap. You can also look for jewelry cleaners specifically made with gentle ingredients to clean gold bands. Perhaps one of the most surprising gold cleaners, though, is beer. (Yes, really!) Some jewelers claim that the acidic hops in beer can remove grime and dirt from solid gold. If you're in need of a quick polish, pour a bit of pale ale on a cloth and gently wipe down your band, making sure to avoid your center stone. (This is just safe for the metal, after all.) Quickly rinse it off, not letting the beer sit for too long, and pat your bauble dry. 

### How to clean a platinum ring 

Since platinum is one of the most durable engagement ring metals, there are a few more ways to clean it at home beyond soap and water. One way to quickly clean your ring is to soak it in a 50/50 solution of Windex and hydrogen peroxide. Windex will remove the day-to-day dirt build-up, while the peroxide will kill any bacteria on the ring. Soak your diamond ring in this mixture for about 10 to 15 minutes. Gently scrub it with a soft brush to remove residue, and rinse it thoroughly with lukewarm water before patting dry.

While this at-home engagement ring cleaning hack is great if you're in a pinch, it's crucial to only use this combination on a diamond center stone. Because diamonds are so tough, they can withstand being in a Windex and hydrogen peroxide solution. This cleaning suggestion is not recommended for colored gems or other softer center stones (like pearls, emeralds or rubies). 

### How to clean a silver ring 

If you have a pure silver engagement ring, there are a few additional ways to give it a deep at-home cleaning. The first is a method your grandmother may have used for her antique silverware. Vinegar and baking soda is an age-old solution that can improve tarnished silver. Start by pouring 1/2 cup white vinegar and 2 tablespoons baking soda into a shallow bowl. Mix the solution until the baking soda is completely dissolved. Then, soak your diamond ring in the mixture for two to three hours. Rinse your ring under cold water and dry it thoroughly with a soft cloth.

Another crazy concoction you might have heard of is using ketchup to clean a silver ring. The acidity in the tomatoes is believed to help dissolve tarnish on pure silver metals. While this isn't the first method we'd recommend to clean your engagement ring at home, it's certainly a creative hack you can try…if you dare. If you do want to attempt cleaning your silver engagement ring with ketchup, do not leave it on your ring for more than a few minutes. Rinse it with warm water and pat dry when you're done. 

## Mistakes to Avoid When Cleaning Your Ring 

Diamonds are revered for their strength and their perfect 10 rating on the Mohs scale of hardness, but that doesn't mean they should be subjected to harsh cleaning chemicals. Here are a few mistakes to avoid so you can best clean your rings at home:

  * Don't use chemicals like bleach, chlorine, ammonia or acetone to clean your engagement ring, as they can break down the metal in your band. Abrasive products like powdered cleaners and toothpaste can also erode metals and discolor your ring, so they should never be used for at-home cleanings.
  * Only use soft brushes on your diamond. Hard-bristled toothbrushes and scrub pads can scratch your diamond or the setting (especially if you have a gold band). Over time, this can mar its beautiful sparkle and lower its value.
  * Take your ring off before using thick lotions and creams, as they can create residue build-up on your diamond. This can make your engagement ring look and feel dirty, or even cause it to become discolored, especially if your band is made of white gold or platinum.
  * Take care when choosing specialized jewelry cleaners. Look for products that do not include chemicals or abrasive components. Even certain chemicals that won't harm your ring could discolor your diamond. Look for products from accredited retailers, and read reviews from real users to ensure your purchase is a reliable one.
