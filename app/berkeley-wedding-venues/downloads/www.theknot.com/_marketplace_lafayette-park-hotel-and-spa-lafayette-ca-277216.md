Reserving, tracking and ensuring my husband and I wouldn't be on the hook for unused room blocks was a stressful experience. The staff at LPHS helped us along the way. We ...

also hosted a 'send off brunch' the day after the wedding, and Tiana Shaw was a delight to work with.

The Lafayette Park Hotel is a beautiful hotel, and our guests were overwhelmingly pleased with their experience. A little on the pricey side, but within walking distance to some La...

fayette restaurants. My only compaint was in the process of the group block. The first person I worked with in sales was extremely unresponsive - it could often take over a week to get an email reply. Also, when pulling the downloads of room reservations, there was almost always people missing - I had to send the hotel more than 15 reservations throughout the process that I knew were booked in our block, not showing onh our block download. One of them was my own room (bride and groom). The mistakes were always corrected, but cetainly a headache I didn't need. There were also several instances of tech issues with the room block link. My guests would email to say they were trying to book a room through the link, but it wasn't working. They fixed the problem quickly, but it was still annoying. Once the wedding came, everyone was very pleased with the acommodations. The rooms are beautiful, service is good at the front desk, etc. But, the administrative side of things leading up the wedding had some speed bumps.
