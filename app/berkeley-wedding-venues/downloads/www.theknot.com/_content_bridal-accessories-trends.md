## How to Choose Wedding Dress Accessories That Elevate Your Look

According to wedding veil designer and owner of [Ofrenda Studio](https://ofrendastudio.com/), Sandra Morales, "wedding accessories are more than just add-ons; They're integral to expressing brides' individuality." Morales. With that in mind, we recommend choosing bridal accessories that reflect your own unique sense of style. For instance, if you love a timeless look, you might be drawn to a simple [wedding veil style](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-veil-trends). On the other hand, if you prefer to bend the rules of tradition, you might consider a [veil alternative](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-veil-alternatives), like a draped neck sash or a wedding cape. 

When thinking about [what jewelry to wear with your wedding dress](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-to-pick-jewelry-to-match-your-wedding-dress), consider how various styles will work with your dress neckline. The best [jewelry for a strapless wedding dress](https://www.theknot.com/content/necklace-for-strapless-wedding-dress) and the best [necklace for a V-neck wedding dress](https://www.theknot.com/content/necklace-for-v-neck-wedding-dress) will look a bit different. Likewise, if you're wearing a dress with a bit more coverage, you might want to focus your attention on [bridal hair accessories](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-hair-accessories) instead of jewelry, since they'll be more visible. 

If you're not sure how to accessorize a wedding dress, you can always speak with a stylist at your [local bridal salon](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/bridal-salons) for tips. No matter what bride accessories you end up choosing, be sure to try them on with your dress prior to the big day to ensure the final look will match your vision.

Wedding dresses and gloves go hand in hand (pun intended). According to wedding dress designer, [Nadia Manjarrez](https://www.nadiamanjarrez.com/), "Evening gloves have become a modern yet timeless way for brides to add arm coverage while keeping their shoulders exposed, creating a balanced and elegant silhouette." While wedding dresses with sleeves can sometimes feel restrictive, "gloves offer the freedom of movement and comfort many brides are looking for," Manjarrez explains. 

As [evening gloves](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-gloves) (also referred to as opera gloves) continue to make their comeback, Jillian Sassone, founder of [Marrow Fine](https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1851794&u=1030781&m=115444&urllink=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Emarrowfine%2Ecom%2F&afftrack=tk-bridal-accessories-trends) is most intrigued by the way designers are experimenting with different materials and lengths. "I love a modern twist on a classic accessory," she says. From sleek satin to delicate lace, there are more bridal glove options available than ever before. "Even though they're a bold choice, gloves still manage to feel super refined and elegant when done right," Sassone adds. If you're a bride who wears your heart on your sleeve(s), check out these four ways to rock this trend at your 2025 wedding.

A bare neck is never a bad idea, especially for the minimalist bride, but for nearlyweds who want a little something extra, this trend is the way to go. Inspired by old Hollywood, [bridal scarves](https://www.theknot.com/content/winter-wedding-coats-wraps) let you have your very own red carpet-moment as you walk down the aisle. "Neck scarves, or stoles as we call them, have gained popularity because they bring a touch of vintage elegance while offering versatility," says Manjarrez. "The ease of removing it allows for a quick transformation, giving brides the option to switch up their style effortlessly throughout the day," she explains. 

"Wedding scarves are usually made from soft and lightweight materials, like lime silk, organza or chiffon, so they're not overwhelming to your skin or your overall look, says Morales. "I believe they are particularly fitting for elopements and small intimate weddings since they don't carry the symbolic value of a veil," she adds. Of course, for to-be-weds who don't mind bending the rules of tradition, they also serve as a great alternative to a veil. It's no secret that this trend *stole* our hearts, and once you see these four shoppable wedding scarves, we're sure you'll feel the same way:

This season, as models strutted down the runway, many were followed by dramatic trailing capes. For brides skipping the veil, the [wedding cape](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-dresses-with-cape) trend offers another elegant alternative. "Detachable capes and shawls are the perfect combination of style and practicality," says Yuliia Lobachova, Founder of [Yuliia Lobachova](https://yuliialobachova.com/) and [Ricca Sposa](https://riccasposa.com/). "They give brides the flexibility to adapt their look depending on their mood or the occasion–Long ceremonies and formal moments may call for a more elegant and covered appearance, while later in the evening, during the reception or on the dance floor, the cape can be easily removed to reveal a lighter and freer look," she says.

According to Andrea Louie Brown, Divisional Merchandise Manager at [Anthropologie](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=9ibcrDa*U1o&mid=39789&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anthropologie.com%2F&u1=tk-new-bridesmaid-dress-trends%7Cxid:fr1733270078717fge) Weddings, "The ability to go from a modest look during the ceremony to a sleek and more modern style during the reception is appealing to many brides," which explains the rise of this trend in recent years. These four ready-to-wear looks pair perfectly with simple and statement-making gowns alike. _Better yet?_ They won't mess up your hair. 

### Park & Fifth Emma Cape

When it comes to [wedding jewelry](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-jewelry), the world is your oyster. _Literally._ Pearl accessories are the latest craze in the bridal world and beyond (see: [pearlcore](https://www.theknot.com/content/pearlcore-wedding-fashion)). "I don't think pearls will ever go away," says accessory designer and founder of the namesake brand, [Jennifer Behr](https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=2406622&u=1030781&m=146209&urllink=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Ejenniferbehr%2Ecom%2Fen%2Die%3FranEAID%3D3269724%26ranMID%3D45790%26ranSiteID%3D50rqOrVy53Q%2D6edAv51NRuVd86PvP%5FDXhw%26utm%5Fcampaign%3DLinkhaitao%26utm%5Fcontent%3D1%26utm%5Fmedium%3DAffiliate%26utm%5Fsource%3DLinkshare&afftrack=tk-bridal-accessories-trends). "There is a timelessness to pearls which makes them sentimental, but their shape and luster gives them a modern look," she explains. "Pearls are also versatile, and depending on how they

are styled, can give a nod to the classic bride aesthetic or can be redefined in a chic way." 

When it comes to bridal accessories, there's no shortage of options with pearls. According to Nayri Kalayjian, founder of [Wedding Fashion Expert](https://weddingfashionexpert.com/), " you can find pearls on tiaras, earrings, headbands, necklaces–specifically pearl chokers–handbags and more." For nearlyweds hoping to double down on the trend, "there are even pearl wedding dresses and even pearl wedding shoes," she adds. However you prefer to wear them, we're sure you'll agree: Whoever said diamonds are a girl's best friend clearly never saw these four iridescent accessories.

Want to make a fashion statement at your wedding? Take notes from New York Bridal Fashion Week and opt for a pop of color. Colorful accessories made a big splash on this year's runways leading many modern brides to embrace these non-traditional looks for their own nuptials. According to Behr, "adding color through accessories is a whimsical way to make your bridal attire special." Behr has observed modern brides incorporating red and other jewel-tones into their wedding looks, of course, these aren't the only options when it comes to color.

"One trend we're loving is how brides are embracing the 'something blue' tradition with their jewelry," says Sassone. "Many are wearing heirloom pieces with blue gemstones, either styled as is or reworked to feel fresh and personal," she adds. From baby blues to bright pink hues, there are plenty of eye-catching options with which to customize your bridal ensemble. Here, we've rounded up a few of our favorites.

Bow details were also all over New York Bridal Fashion Week, from wedding dresses with detachable bows, flirty hair bows, and bow-embellished veils. Of course, it's easy to see why everyone is so *wrapped up* in this trend. A [bow accessory](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-bows) is guaranteed to add a romantic touch to any of your bridal outfits, from the engagement party to the rehearsal dinner and beyond. "Throughout our history, bows have been present in many collections in one way or another, because they are a classic symbol that brings a touch of femininity, sophistication and beauty in any era," says Marco Marrero, co-founder of [Marco & Maria](https://marcoymaria.com/en/). "Today, you'll find bows incorporated into so many aspects of bridal fashion, including gloves, dresses, jewelry, earrings, necklaces, shoes, veils and more," Kalayjian reveals. Check out a few of our favorite ways to wear the trend below.

Enter: [Bridal statement earrings](https://www.theknot.com/content/12-stunning-statement-earrings), necklaces and bracelets. "Bold jewelry has made a huge comeback in bridal fashion, with brides now embracing statement pieces that reflect their unique style and also add a modern twist to their overall wedding look–think sculptural earrings, chunky bracelets, statement pinky rings, or chunkier wedding bands," says Sassone. "I love how these pieces add a contemporary twist to the bridal aesthetic and can be a bold contrast to a delicate wedding dress, plus, they can also be worn well beyond the wedding day," she adds.

"It's important to remember that earrings and headpieces are the accessories you see when you look at someone; The eyes are drawn to the face and what's around it, whether it be a beautiful pair of earrings or a statement necklace, these are the first things people notice when they look at you," says Behr. "They will also be center stage in all your photography, so take time to pick out something special, she recommends. Here, we're rounded up a few of our favorite pieces to inspire your search.
