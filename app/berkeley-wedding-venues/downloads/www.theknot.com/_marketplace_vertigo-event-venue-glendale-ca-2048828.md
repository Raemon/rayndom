Vertigo Event Venue is a street-art-inspired wedding venue located in Glendale, CA. This East LA oasis is family-owned and -operated and creates a truly unique experience for couples on their special occasions. Modern and elegant, the event center is characterized by a bold black and white design and sleek furnishings that marry the contemporary and the classic. Couples are invited to explore the luxurious interior and host their wedding in this striking event space. When you step into Vertigo Event Venue, you will immediately be greeted by the opulence of the Lower Lobby. This chic foyer boasts black lacquered Armani buffets, gunmetal leather wallpaper, and crystal column chandeliers that cast a cool glow over the glossy floors. The pièce de résistance is the 19-foot Shitake Caesarstone Bar, where your guests can order cocktails before the ceremony begins. Ceremonies and receptions are held in either of the two spacious ballrooms. The White Ballroom is a pristine all-white hall that can accommodate 320 and features velvet pinstripe wallpaper, mirrored mosaic columns, and hand-blown crystal lighting fixtures. A grand mirrored staircase leads up to the 3,450-square-foot Black Banquet Room, which also hosts as many as 320 guests. This dark and daring ballroom is adorned with a domino ceiling treatment, black Murano chandeliers, and an absolute black granite bar. Whichever ballroom you choose, your wedding aesthetic will pop against the stunning monochromatic backdrops. Each of the banquet halls at Vertigo Event Venue comes with a large white quartz dance floor, dance floor lighting, and pin spot lighting. The venue also supplies Chiavari chairs, specialty linens, glassware, china, and a variety of tables. Catering is provided in-house and can be served buffet style, family style, plated, or during the cocktail hour as hors d'oeuvres. The adventurous California and Mediterranean fusion cuisine is prepared by Vertigo's classically French-trained executive chef and sizzles with an international flavor. In addition, a sophisticated get-ready suite is available for day-of preparations and offers stunning views of Southern California's cityscape and mountains.

I’ve had my 30th birtbday party here and my bridal shower! Forget the fact that the space is beautiful and your photos look amazing…. The FOOD is YUMMMM!!! i can’t stress that enou...

gh and how important that was for me! AND the staff is so awesome and fun and cool! I would highly recommend the space for any event. Wedding, Birthdays, showers… Also it’s really nice that their are two rooms to choose from the black room or white room and they both have bars for cocktail hour outside of the rooms. LOVE me a nice cocktail hour.
