Kirsten

Owner/Operator/Artist

I dove into special event styling around 2010.Hair styling has always been my specialty from a young age. Working with several talented makeup artists I naturally grew a love for makeup artistry as well. As the styles have changed over the years I continue to learn and grow as an artist. Keeping up with the trends and skills is always at the top of my list. I am constantly working on my skills and found a love for teaching. I now have a team of artists who are all very talented and versatile! We love what we do and that is making you feel and look your best. We pay attention to detail in all aspects from timing and scheduling to executing the look. We have the experience to comfortably get you from the planning stage to walking down the aisle with ease and confidence.

stunning. My makeup was done by Jen, and my hair by Sara. They both are highly skilled professionals, super friendly, sweet and their attention to detail was excellent. As someone who is quite shy and indecisive when it comes to personal decisions, they both made me feel very comfortable and ensured that everything went smoothly. They listened carefully to my vision and took the time to confirm that I was satisfied with the results. Communication with Kirsten, the owner, from the trial through to the wedding day was excellent. Throughout the months and weeks leading up to the event, I reached out with numerous questions, and Kirsten was consistently prompt and helpful in her responses. I am very grateful to everyone at Devotion Studio for being part of my special day. Thank you all for your time, attention, and care. I highly recommend Devotion Studio to anyone planning their wedding or special event.

When it comes to hair & makeup services for your wedding day, I cannot recommend Devotion Studio enough! From the very first point of contact, their kindness & attention to detail ...

put me at ease. Kirsten provides so many valuable resources to help you prepare for your trial and to help your wedding party have the information they need to get ready day of as well. My trial was wonderful; Kirsten & Sandy who would be responsible for my hair & makeup day of were both there and took the time to look at the pictures I brought, listen to my ideas and help me answer any questions I had. They made me feel completely comfortable, and my trial went so smoothly. Kirsten took video and photos afterwards to remember every detail of what we had done, and gave me instructions for the rest of the day so I could truly see what it would be like to live in that hair & makeup for 8+ hours. Communication leading up to the day was fantastic, which was so reassuring during a stressful planning period. On the wedding day itself, they were a calming and fun presence for the whole party, including both moms and girls who don’t often do hair & makeup. Everyone raved about their final looks. Kirsten & Sandy also took my notes from after our trial and made the small adjustments to ensure everything was absolutely perfect. The final result was better than I could have ever imagined. My hair and makeup were beyond gorgeous and lasted all day & night. Most importantly, they made me feel like the most beautiful version of myself! It was truly a magical experience, and set the tone for the rest of my wedding day. Thank you, Devotion Studio!

My wedding was on 4.27.25. My hair stylist was Adaline (did the hair and “make-up” for the trial and hair for the big day) and the make up stylist for the big day was Taylor. I wan...

t to preface this review that I have received refunds for SOME but not ALL issues I had with Devotion Studios. I will explain all in the review below. If you are a destination bride/groom, I suggest you READ this whole thing. Let's start with the pricing. The pricing overall seems fair for the Napa area. Tips are paid for upfront with the bill, claiming that this is so the bride, groom and their guests won’t need to worry about money on the big day or after. Wish there was more of a retainer option, but whatever, not much I can do there. Now for the trial stage. I did need to reschedule a few times due to being sick (1st time) then I had an unexpected event that made me need to rebook (2nd time). Kristen, business owner, was very flexible and rebooked for me no problem. I was able to meet up the 3rd time and make the 2 hour drive one way to their studio (Cupertino to Sebastopol). I was told via email and contract that this would be a 3 hour trial for hair and make up together. I paid for both beforehand with tips (was required). It took 4 hours to just do my hair, and after another 45 mins I got to see my only eye makeup. I felt pressured to end before seeing all my face because my now husband came to pick me up at the 3 hour mark AND the stylist had a wedding she needed to get to after my trial. I never received any kind of refund (full or partial) for not seeing my whole face for my make up trial. When I brought up this concern, instead I was at first told I could drive up again and pay for another trial at 50%. After some back and forth and me asking for pictures of the eye make-up (that was not given) I was offered to do the trial a few days before the wedding. Money was not mentioned so it was unclear if I needed to pay more. At this point I should have backed out, but I did not because my hair after the trial was great especially with the extensions, this detail is important later. Also, I didn’t want to argue more about money. On the big day, both stylists arrived at their agreed upon time. Everything was going smoothly despite the drama from the trial until it came to me (the bride) getting ready to do my hair. The stylist forgot my hair extensions! Fortunately, my maid of honor brought her own. It wasn't enough for my thin hair and it was a few shades different but it was the only option I had. I won't get into how upsetting this was for me given how much time, effort, money, and energy I've put into planning our wedding and how I would look. But you can put together by the rating and length of this review, I was enraged. My make-up was light and great, Taylor was able to make me feel better and make me look beautiful. Was I refunded for the extensions (I had to prepay for) and my hair for the big day without asking? Yes. Did I have to specifically ask that my MOH’s hair get refunded? Yes, and it was refunded. Despite all of this, all my guests said my hair looked great, but the shade difference in the extensions was NOT what I wanted and not what I saw in the trial. How I decided a 3 star rating was fair. It would have been a 5 star review if my extensions made it to the big day and I was given a partial refund (never got it) for the make-up trial fail without needing to go back and forth via email. My makeup on the big day was great! If I could rate only that part of the experience I would give a full 5 stars. I would have made this a 4 star review if I was given a partial refund for the make up trial fail. I felt that a 2 star review would have been too harsh since I was given an email apology and refund of my hair and my extensions without needing to reach out on our mini honeymoon. Good luck planning and congratulations! Your partner is lucky to have you!

Response from Devotion Studio on 05/21/2025

Hi Amira, I apologize for your feeling that we weren't devoted to making you happy. That i...

s certainly not the case. After serving over ​500 brides, in the last 12 years, we have a system that works very well when followed. I have a few very important pieces to share with the readers that I think will help clear a lot of this up. First of all 3 hours is sufficient time for a hair and makeup preview for 99% of our guests. The 1% of the time that 3 hours is not enough is when we have a bride who does not know what she wants when she arrives for the preview appointment, or there are a lot of adjustments to the style along the way as we are creating the perfect look. It is times like these that cause large delays. For Amira's style and per her request, Adeline created a few different braids to try in her hair, which can be quite time consuming. With that being said Amira's statement of 4 hours to complete her hairstyle is inaccurate. It was 3 hours that Adeline took to complete ​the hairstyle​ that Amira was absolutely in love with. Adeline is very thorough and is a fantastic artist who is fully dedicated to assuring each of her guests are fully satisfied with their looks. When Adeline was doing Amira's makeup she was not rushing she was working efficiently to get her makeup look completed. Adeline felt an energy shift to a place of anxiety, assuming it was because the fiance was waiting. At a point where Amira's makeup look was almost complete, she said she needed to go and that she trusted that the finished look would come together on the wedding day. Adeline was prepared to finish the makeup look but Amira chose to call it for the day. This is why I did not refund anything for the makeup preview appointment that Amira chose to not finish. Adeline had plenty of time to complete the look before she headed off for the wedding party she was servicing later that day. I did offer for Amira to return to do a makeup preview appointment at half cost. I suggested doing this for the rehearsal dinner since she would be local to us at that time for the wedding and it would have been nice for her to have an elevated look for the dinner as well as settle any nerves about the look for the wedding day. As for the extensions not making it to Amira for the wedding day, that was a first time mistake that had never happened before. Since​ then we have made changes to our system, that mistake will never happen again. Guaranteed! ​We did not charge for the several last-minute cancellations/rescheduling of the preview appointments that this bride needed to make. There were several last minute additions to her bridal party needs which we were flexible in adjusting for her, I even decided to notify her that I was sending a second artist at no additional cost (which was a savings of $150). There were last minute timing needs. We moved our schedules to make her morning flow well. As you can see from our other reviews, unfortunately, Amira had a one off experience with us. We do take our careers and your needs very seriously and want to ensure a comfortable experience for all. We have over ​200 5 star reviews on various platforms that show we always have our bride's best interest in mind at all times. Our processes and level of service is something we do with destination brides all the time and people are happy to do so and it works quite well.

I had the best experience with the Devotion team for my hair and makeup for my wedding this September. I had a large group which included 7 bridesmaids, my mom, my mother-in-law, 2...

aunts, and my grandmother who all got both hair and makeup done. They prepared with 2 makeup artists, and 2 hair stylists to get the job done by 1:00pm. They were efficient, quick, while still making us all feel pampered all morning. They were professional, but also personable which I appreciate. Tamara and Nicole F. did our hair and everyone’s hair turned out amazing and held up all night during the wedding. Nicole P and Taylor did our makeup and my favorite thing about Devotion is how they create a natural glam look! I mean it when I say they were quick and without losing quality! I got the honor of having my hair done by Tamara. We had trialed my hair one way and then I wanted a few minor changes done before we started the morning of my wedding and she was so flexible and delivered my vision perfectly! Taylor did my makeup and I LOVED how it turned out. I felt beautiful but still like myself which was so important since I don’t wear a ton of makeup day to day. Taylor also was so patient and kind with me when I was starting to stress and feel nervous. I was thankful for that. I highly recommend Devotion Studio for all your hair and makeup needs.

I booked the elopement package for my summer 2024 wedding in Sonoma County. Kirsten quickly responded to my inquiry and got on a phone call with me to help me decide on services an...

d advice on when to book. In that initial conversation, I knew that she was personable, kind, honest, and looked out for her team, all things I valued. I knew then I would go with Devotion Studio. I opted for the elopement package because I didn’t have a bridal party. Despite not having a formal bridal party, Kirsten and Addy made me feel like a total queen. I note this because I was initially anxious about our wedding in booking vendors (e.g., ‘would they think less of me because I’m not having my wedding at a vineyard/don’t have a bridal party/etc’), and those worries never crossed my mind when working with Kirsten and Addy. I had already booked a makeup preview and closer to my wedding date, I asked if there was space to have a hair preview too. Kirsten and Addy were able to make it work and I was able to have both a hair and makeup preview. My preview was two days prior to the wedding because my partner and I traveled to his hometown to get married. The day before my preview I added a ‘plan b hair option’ to my inspiration photos in case my hair wasn’t long enough to do what I wanted. When I met Addy, she said, “Let’s try plan A first. There are lots of ways to make this work.” And she did! When I saw my hair and makeup at my preview, I said “I can’t believe I look like this!” Not that I didn’t look like me, but I felt like Addy made me look the best version of me. She truly nailed the sophisticated yet whimsical and not stuffy vibe I wanted. Throughout the preview, she would check in with me to see what I liked/didn’t. Addy was a true gem to work with. She was professional and kind, and unbelievably patient wedding day (our wedding was less structured than most). My hair and make up lasted all day and past the after party! I have zero regrets booking with Devotion Studio and feel like I got everything I wanted and more. Highly recommend them for on-site beauty squad! Thank you so much for being a part of this special day and making it all the more meaningful. (photos from Shannon Hillyard Photography)

She was part of the group and through all the craziness, she made me feel like a princess. I absolutely adored my hair and make up.
