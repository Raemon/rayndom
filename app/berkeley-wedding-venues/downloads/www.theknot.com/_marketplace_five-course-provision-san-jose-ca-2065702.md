Chef John is outstanding in every way. He worked closely with us to create a menu that reflected our personal tastes while staying within our budget. His culinary range spans a wid...

e variety of cuisines, and every single dish we tried, whether at our tasting or on the wedding day, was consistently delicious. Chef John’s depth of flavor, creativity, flexibility, and professionalism could easily qualify him to teach a master class. So many of our guests told us it was the best wedding food they’ve ever had. If we had to choose one type of food to eat for the rest of our lives together, we’d choose Chef John’s every time. Seriously, if Chef John is an option for your wedding or event, don’t think twice. You won’t be disappointed.

They were also great to work with when it came to budget, offering fair pricing for what was provided, without sacrificing quality or service. The staff was friendly, attentive, and kept everything running smoothly throughout the night. All in all, a wonderful experience with delicious food and warm, thoughtful service. Highly recommended if you're lucky enough to book them!

We can't say enough good things about our experience working with chef John and the team at Five Course Provision. From the beginning, he made the process feel very collaborative. ...

He listened to our vision of what we wanted our menu to convey, and he fine tuned it with his ideas and suggestions. You can tell he's very passionate about his craft. He was also helpful and accommodating as we had some special dietary needs for some in our party. It was very reassurring that he is able to consider special dietary needs or palates. When it comes to the food itself, the flavors were incredible. Even the pickiest eaters in the party were left speechless. Everything from the appetizers, to the main course, and the desserts were talked about throughout the day. In fact, our guests are still raving about the food days after the wedding. And no one left hungry! There was plenty for everyone. Last but not least, the serving staff he employs are exceptional and executed the perfect dinner service. They were very attentive to our guests, and also ensured that we ate, despite the dynamic nature of our wedding schedule. We especially appreciated that they set aside appetizers after we wound up missing cocktail hour. And his planner Diana was fantastic at getting everything at the tables setup. We really appreciated her attention to detail, especially when she found ways to enhance our decor. In short, we would highly recommend getting John and Five Course Provision to cater your wedding. You are in good, capable hands with them.

Went for a tasting with Chef John and it was amazing! We decided to go with an Asian fusion menu and had our curated menu in front of us while the appetizers rolled in. All the foo...

d was delicious, nothing below our standards. The dishes were seasoned well with the flavors spread evenly throughout the dish. Personally, the short rib was our favorite but there were also some dishes we weren’t expecting to be good like the daikon and radish salad. Overall, a great experience where the food stands out and chef John sat down with us at the end to go over any questions and go over each part of the menu!

We couldn’t have asked for a better catering experience throughout our wedding journey. From the very first consultation, to our tasting where my husband and our father's were left...

with a lasting impression (we were talking about it for weeks!), to the last bite of our delicious braised short rib, Five Course Provisions exceeded every expectation. Chef John made it easy to bring to life the vision that I had for our wedding day. He made sure to incorporate elements that were a priority into our day and executed an astounding menu that uniquely blended both the Iranian and European cultures that were important to us. Our guests couldn't stop talking about how delicious our appetizers were during cocktail hour and how delicious the food was for dinner. John even came up with a Persian inspired mocktail for my husband's side of the family that consisted of Rose, Lemon & Pomegranate and it was a complete hit! Our top priority was making sure we booked a caterer that did not sacrifice quality over quantity. Food is a big part of our cultures and if I had to do our wedding reception over again, I would choose Five Course in a heartbeat. Beyond the food, the service was excellent. The team was professional, friendly, and so attentive throughout the entire event. They worked seamlessly with our other vendors to ensure everything went off without a hitch. Throughout my experience, John would find ways to surprise and delight - I am so incredibly grateful. Five Course Provisions played a huge role in making our wedding day unforgettable. If you’re looking for a caterer who combines exceptional food with top-notch service, look no further! Thank you so much for helping create the wedding of our dreams!

Where do I even begin? Chef John and his team at Five Course Provisions made our wedding dining experience truly unforgettable! From start to finish, the food was absolutely incred...

ible, and we can't thank him enough for the unforgettable flavors and presentation. One of the highlights was the pressed juices Chef John made specially for us. We had a lot of kids and guests who don't drink alcohol, and the juices were a huge hit! They were refreshing, delicious, and something we hadn’t seen at any other wedding. The hor d’oeuvres were perfection, with my personal favorite being the tuna tartare bite. The meal was perfectly cooked. We started with an amazing starter salad that was light and fresh, followed by a pasta course that I’m still thinking about to this day. The flavors were so rich and comforting, and it was easily one of the best pasta dishes I’ve ever had. The entrees were just as delicious—so thoughtfully prepared, and each bite was full of flavor. I truly wish I could eat the whole meal again! And if that wasn’t enough, Chef John went above and beyond with mini desserts. The black sesame cheesecake cup was a standout—so creamy, with the perfect balance of flavors. Later in the night, we had sliders, which were the perfect late-night snack and had everyone raving. Chef John and Five Course Provisions elevated our wedding experience in such a meaningful way. The food was a key part of making our celebration so special, and we couldn’t have asked for a better caterer. If you want top-notch food and service for your big day, look no further—Chef John and his team are absolutely outstanding!

amily style along with passed hors d’oeuvres and organized all the rental supplies that were not handled by our venue. Upon arriving, everything smelled so good, but had no idea how amazing the food would be. Everyone who attended are big foodies and very picky, and everyone just raved about the food as well as his team. I have had many people ask me for Chef John’s contact information and they plan to reach out for future events. Without a doubt, I recommend Five Course Provisions! You will not be disappointed.

If I could give this company 10 out of 5 stars I would. Chef John and his team were absolutely incredible! Honestly, when I found Five Course Provisions, I was a little hesitant as...

they really didn’t have many reviews. I called around and many of the more reviewed caterers took a long time to get back to me or asked me to pick from their very standard type of wedding menus. When I called Chef John, the experience was completely different. From day one I could tell that he wanted to work with my fiancé and me to make our wedding day the best it could be. He also said that he could basically make whatever we wanted for the menu and keep it within our budget. So, we decided to give Five Course Provisions a go and honestly it was the best decision we made! Chef John really did work with us for the 6 months that we planned our event to make sure the food was perfect. 3 months prior, we had our tasting and were absolutely blown away by the food. It didn’t taste like the generic wedding food that we were accustomed to, it truly was a gourmet experience. When we got to our wedding day, the reception was absolutely perfect. Chef John and his team took care of everything from setup to clean up. The food was just as amazing as during our tasting. We were blown away by how many of our guests commented on how it was literally the best wedding food they had ever had. You could tell the passion that Chef John and his team had for ensuring an amazing culinary experience. If you are considering Five Course Provisions, don’t hesitate. Book them without delay. You’ll be so glad you did.

We are big foodies, so we knew that selecting a caterer for our wedding was going to be one of the most important decisions we made. Fortunately, we found Five Course Provisions. ...

From the first sample menu Chef John sent, we knew we were in good hands. Everything we tasted was delicious, and John and Eric were very helpful making accommodations for guests with different dietary needs. Almost every appetizer was duplicated with a vegan alternative (e.g. tuna tartare and beet tartare). We heard from so many people at the wedding how delicious the food was, and Chefs John & Eric executed a very challenging and complicated menu with seeming ease. The pasta course in particular was a hit! Additionally, Chefs John & Eric were great with communication, and just all-around friendly lovely people! If you want the utmost in culinary experience at your wedding, don’t hesitate to hire them!
