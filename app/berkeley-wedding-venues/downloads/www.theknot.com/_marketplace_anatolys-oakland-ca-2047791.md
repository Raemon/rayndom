Anatoly's has a beautiful brick-and-mortar store that you can visit to get your measurements taken. The boutique is home to thousands of fabrics, many from top English and Italian brands. Alternatively, your eye might be drawn to one of Anatoly's ready-to-wear pieces, which can be altered for a better fit. The company's sister brand, Anatoly & Sons, carries its own line of suits, jackets, and trousers. In addition to the made-to-measure and bespoke options, you can request alterations for your wedding attire. Everything from the fabric, color, and lining to the buttons, vents, lapels, and pockets can be customized. Before anything else, you will have a foundational try-on at the store where your measurements are taken, then Anatoly's will alter clothes to match your proportions. Should you be selecting a bespoke suit, the garment is made entirely from scratch. These suits can be customized any way that you want. Anatoly's is pleased to offer a non-discriminatory and safe place for everyone as they enjoy their wedding preparations.

Anatoly's (and K in particular) is simply the best tailor in the Bay Area. K made me a beautiful bespoke suit for my wedding and in the process met with me at least a half dozen t...

imes to ensure that the fit was perfect. Anatoly's also made a couple of made-to-measure shirts, tailored a couple of suits I already had, and helped revive a bespoke sport coat from the 80s that belonged to my dad and preserved the style perfectly. I honestly don't know if I can/will ever be able to go to a different tailor. The guys are also some of the sincerely nicest people around.

I could not thank K and the entire Anatoly family enough for their help with my Made to Measure suit for my wedding! My wedding suit journey with them started January 2020 as I pla...

nned to get married in June 2020. Like many other Covid brides, that all got postponed and through the entire year of waiting, K was extremely patient and supportive throughout the whole process. By the time plans were finalized to get married in July 2021, I went to see K at the Anatoly store to try on my suit for the first time since our initial appointment one year later. I had lost 35 lbs since our initial appointment and because of this, I was swimming in the suit and K had to basically make me a new suit that fit my new body! A couple of fittings and tweaks later...my suit was perfect. Everyone at Anatoly's is extremely knowledgeable about how a suit should fit and they will give you their honest opinion if something does not look right. Being a woman and finding a suit that fits is extremely hard but K made the whole process super easy and made me feel comfortable the entire time. He will not let you walk out the door until you are completely satisfied. I will definitely be coming back to get more suits made and the most exciting thing is that Anatoly's will be coming out with Made to Measure women's suits!

My husband bought a suit for our wedding at Anatoly's. It was a fantastic experience start to finish. A fully custom suit was not in our budget; however, Kirill helped us select a ...

ready-made suit and made so many excellent alterations (including an amazing lining) that it feels custom! Excellent communication, perfect (and timely) tailoring, plus helpful (but not pushy) styling suggestions. We'll be back for future suits and alterations!

Glad to see all the 5 star reviews on here, because they're well deserved. Anatoly's is the best place to get a custom suit, tie, shoes, soc-- really any clothing you need for the ...

big day, all at a fantastic price. Anatoly, K, and the whole team are responsive, friendly, and truly dedicated to making sure their clients look and feel amazing. They take well-deserved pride in their work, and you will too once you have a suit that will last a decade.

Anatoly’s is the best suit shop in the Bay. Kirill will make sure you have an amazing experience and that your suit is perfect. Look no further! You can’t beat this place.

I initially went in just to get some measurements for a custom suit being made elsewhere, and was so impressed with their quality of service that I decided to go with Anatoly's for...

everything else related to my outfit, including a fitted shirt, custom shoes, and the alterations on my suit. They politely made suggestions on style when requested, and were incredibly helpful and supportive throughout the process. I imagine they would have done a great job on my suit if my other experiences there were any indication. I'l definitely go back there for my next suit or any additional alterations. Thanks K and team!

I could not thank K and the rest of the company what they have done for me. I unfortunately did not buy my full tuxedo from them, but they did everything and anything I wanted. I w...

ill be giving them all my future services for any custom suits/tuxedos. I also plan to purchase a pair of custom dress shoes soon! Now to what was done. I wanted custom inner jacket lining, which I’ve called around and Anatoly’s was the only or if very few shops around the Bay Area that did any kind of work like that. I got my jacket and pants fitted to my liking. I did purchase my white dress shirt from the company, and had it custom for my body type. Again, I cannot thank K and Anatoly’s enough for making my wedding tuxedo as perfect as it was. Service was amazing and beyond. Anatoly’s service has so much passion and realness behind every detail and craft. The company makes you feel welcomed, and they make you feel a part of their family business. Much love

I mainly worked with Kay but interacted with a few other employees at Anatoly's, they were all fantastic. I've never owned a custom suit before and came in on a whim, no appointmen...

t, when suit shopping for my wedding. The team was so kind and accommodating, they treated me like family despite me being a complete novice to suit shopping. I was so impressed that I ordered my custom suit that same first day that I walked in. They presented me with every option imaginable and I struck the perfect balance between recommending things and leaving me to execute my vision. I've never been more excited about a piece of clothing and the end results were perfect. Also, as a lifelong Oakland native, it's a pleasure to support this family business that has been around for so long. I'm already looking forward to my next suit!
