## **How to Rent a Mansion for a Wedding**

![Wedding at mansion](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/e6638bfe-3796-484f-b931-66dfa6172076~rs_768.h-cr_0.336.2000.3003)

Can you rent a mansion for a wedding? Absolutely. But it's not quite the same as booking a typical venue. Many of these estates are historic properties, which means there can be a few more rules to follow when it comes to hosting an event. (Some historic properties, for example, only have their grounds available for weddings and can't host events inside the house itself.) Knowing your budget, guest count and the type of ceremony and reception you want early on will help you figure out whether choosing a mansion for a wedding rental is the right fit. Pro tip: If possible, tour the estate in person—seeing the space firsthand makes it much easier to imagine where you'll say "I do," host cocktail hour and dance the night away.

As for how much it is to rent a mansion for a wedding, prices will vary. Many of these large homes come with equally large rental fees, though not all. Plus, several offer catering, table and chair rentals, cakes, a wedding coordinator and more as part of the rental package.
