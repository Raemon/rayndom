Overall positive experience with Karla and her team. They had everything I needed and did their best to work with me and my coordinator/venue to accommodate. Minus one star because...

they lost track of my deposit and made me provide proof that they cashed my check. Not too big of a deal but extra leg work for a bride that's already got her hands full.

I had originally looked into and was almost ready to book with another company when they began to nickel and dime me on fees. I started a new search since I needed about 100-150 w...

hite wooden chairs for my ceremony at Shakespeare Garden this past May 2014. I came across All Seasons Event Rentals and gave them a call. Karla Angulo was incredibly helpful, polite, and on top of everything! All Seasons Event Rentals had the chairs that I wanted at a better price and told me up front all the fees, which were only for set-up/break-down and delivery. The fees were even a better price than the other company! I was even able to decrease the number of chairs that I rented two weeks before the event at no additional cost. On the day-of, everything went smoothly and seamlessly! I highly recommend All Seasons Event Rentals the next time you are planning an event!!

After getting quotes from other companies that wanted over $350 simply to manage delivery and pickup, I was thrilled to find All Seasons Event Rentals for my wedding. Not only did...

I encounter amazing, reasonable prices, but Karla was fantastic to work with. Since I work standard business hours, it was wonderful to find someone who I could bounce my (many) questions off of via email - In fact, I never spoke to her directly until she came to pick up the items after the reception, but she made me feel so comfortable that it didn't feel necessary. We rented a variety of items - chairs, linens, plates, flatware, serving utensils, etc. They delivered them directly to our site by 9am without the 2 hour window quoted by others (which most companies charge large extra fees for, as it is considered) and when the weather took a turn for the worse, they were easy to contact, and agreed to come an hour earlier than our scheduled pick up! Overall, I cannot say enough good things about Karla and her team - she is patient, responsive, helpful, and trustworthy - and when it comes to rentals, especially for a wedding, that is all you can ask for!

I talked to A LOT of rental companies for our wedding, because though we had a pretty simple request (25 chairs and 1 table to be delivered and picked-up on the same day) a lot of ...

companies gave us a lot of trouble and really high charges. All Season Event Rentals were great, delivering on time (and dealing with traffic issues in Golden Gate Park - instead of leaving it far away they did the extra effort to deliver it all the way into the ceremony location!) and picking up on time and not taking extra charges for same-day, for after 5 o'clock or anything else that all the other companies requested. Highly Recommended, easy to deal with, good price and reliable service.

Seasons gave me the best price on the silver chivari chairs. The chairs were in excellent condition, the look new. They were on time, set up and brake down. I have only good things to say about this company and would definitely recommend them to anyone getting married. I also use them for day of coordination, this is a great service they offer and affordable. Karla has a lot of experience in this area and has done many weddings. My husband and I were very happy to have her on our team and appreciate all the hard work. Our wedding was a blast and many guest continue to talk about how great everything was handled and ran.

from ASER gave me the best price for both set of chairs. They did a beautiful set up at Shakespeare Garden and I was very pleased with the service they provided through the planning process and the day of delivery. Both events were a success. My wife and I are very please and definitely recommend ASER. They are very experience and reliable. Cheers, Toni

The only non-rockstar vendor from our wedding day. Why? They delivered chairs for our ceremony in the wrong color. I'm not a high maintenance bride so I didn't get worked up o...

ver it. But we signed a contract for a specific product, and on our day we did NOT receive what was listed on the contract. They're lucky that brown was passable in our location vs the white we ordered. Still we didn't get what we paid for and that irks me. At the end of the day they just aren't reliable enough for me to recommend.

s, china, and glassware. They made the process of reserving and booking the event with very easy. Her staff is reliable and professional; they set up just the way we wanted. They were able to accommodate our request, and the pricing on chivari chairs is very affordable, the chairs look new. My husband and I are happy with the service Karla provided, we also hire her for our Day of Coordination. I was able to communicate with her anytime. We started working together a month and half before our wedding. The day of our wedding she executed our ideas, and made our day stress free. Our families, my husband I enjoyed were able to enjoy our special day.
