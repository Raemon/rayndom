If you are ready to show your commitment to your partner with a special piece of jewelry (but aren't yet ready to tie the knot), you may consider how to give a promise ring. This symbol of your love can represent your promise to be loyal to your partner. Traditionally, a [promise ring](https://www.theknot.com/content/what-is-a-promise-ring) was given with the idea that you will someday get engaged or stay together. Now, when to give a promise ring could depend on many more factors. In some cases, couples who never wish to get married, yet want to remain together, exchange promise rings to show their commitment. Others may exchange a [matching promise ring](https://www.theknot.com/content/promise-rings-women-men-couples) in a [double proposal](https://www.theknot.com/content/double-marriage-proposals) as a sign of love and loyalty if they are in a long-distance relationship. Ahead, we break down everything you need to know about a promise ring proposal. Read ahead to learn about what to say and ideas to make your moment extra special.

  * When to Give Your Partner a Promise Ring
  * What to Say When Giving a Promise Ring
  * 8 Promise Ring Proposal Ideas



## When to Give Your Partner a Promise Ring

While exchanging promise rings isn't a necessary step in a relationship, it is a nice gesture. Giving a promise ring to your partner is a symbol of your [committed relationship](https://www.theknot.com/content/committed-relationship) and can give an extra sign to your S.O. that they are a meaningful part of your life. You can give a promise ring to your partner at any time, but it's best to do so in a meaningful way. Set up a special date or find a beautiful moment to give this symbol of your love.

## What to Say When Giving a Promise Ring

[What to say](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-proposals-what-to-say-and-how-to-say-it) when giving someone a promise ring doesn't have to follow a particular formula. You should share your love, explain why you are giving them the gift, and ask them to wear it as a symbol of your commitment. One important tip to remember when giving your partner a promise ring? Don't confuse it with an engagement proposal. Be very clear with your wording that you are giving a promise ring as a sign of your love and commitment, without the explicit intention that you are asking to marry them.

### 1\. Tie Your Proposal With a Special Event

### 2\. Plan a Date Night at Home

Have a special date night complete with a home-cooked meal, served over candlelight, to create a romantic ambiance. As you are having a conversation over dinner, bring out the ring to give to your partner. For a final touch, keep a bottle of sparkling wine or a special dessert to pull out to celebrate.

### 3\. Create a Relationship Scrapbook

Like to get creative? Make a scrapbook filled with memories of your relationship. This cute promise ring proposal idea can include photos of the two of you together, tickets from concerts you saw together, love letters or any other mementos from your history. Once you finish looking through the book, you can offer the ring as the next symbol of your relationship.

### 4\. Take a Hike

Go on a hike together or a scenic walk that ends with a beautiful view. Once you get to that pinnacle location, bring out the promise ring, talk about your love and ask your significant other to enter this next step with you.

### 5\. Create a Crossword Promise Ring Proposal

If your partner loves word games, make a crossword puzzle that reveals a secret message that asks if they want to wear a promise ring. Once they finish the puzzle, you can pull out the special piece of jewelry.

### 6\. Floral-Filled Proposal

Know your partner's favorite flower? Surprise them by filling a room or the table at your special date night with bouquets of that bloom. After setting the tone, you can give them the promise ring and ask them to enter this new phase of your relationship.

### 7\. Go Stargazing

Have a romantic night out underneath the stars before asking your partner to wear your promise ring. Make sure to check the weather to see if it will be a cloud-free evening and get supplies for a cozy night outdoors. A blanket to lie back on, a small speaker for music, and snacks can help make the night perfect before your proposal.

### 8\. Have Your Furry Friend Help

Do you and your partner have a cat or dog? Have them get in on the surprise promise ring proposal by tying the ring box securely to their collar. Then call them over to arrive with a very special gift for your significant other.
