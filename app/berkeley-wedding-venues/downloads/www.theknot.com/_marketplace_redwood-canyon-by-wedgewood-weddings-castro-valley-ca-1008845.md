We recently saved our date for August 2027! We were deciding between two locations and ultimately chose Redwood Canyon largely because of Jacoby, who gave me and my parents a tour ...

and helped personalize our proposal. She is excellent—patient, personable, and genuinely enthusiastic are just a few words that come to mind. Weddings are expensive, and my partner and I felt more confident investing our hard-earned money in a venue with experienced wedding professionals like Jacoby. While we loved the venue itself, what truly set Redwood Canyon apart was the team and coordination services. Knowing we could trust them to help bring our wedding vision to life made all the difference. As for our overall Wedgewood experience, stay tuned as we continue to reach planning milestones and eventually our big day. We have yet to work closely with the rest of the Redwood Canyon team, but fingers crossed that this positive experience will continue throughout the process and on our special day. More to come!

d the Redwood Canyon location in Castro Valley, CA and immediately fell in love with the ceremony site so we booked it right away. We had the pleasure of working with entire WW team throughout the planning process and really appreciated all of the meetings that were included in our package that made planning the wedding so easily. Thank you to Allison who took care of us at our initial planning meeting, Liv for the rest of the meetings and day-of coordinator and Liz , our banquet captain who all made sure our big day ran smoothly. We also want to shout out Chef Steve and his kitchen staff as the food was absolutely amazing. We had so many wedding guests share with us that they went back for seconds and thirds!!! Without the wonderful WW team, we would not have been able to have our hobbit DREAM wedding and we cannot be more grateful. We highly recommend Wedgewood Weddings, especially the Redwood Canyon site to any couple who are looking to have an enjoyable wedding planning experience and beautiful outcome to their wedding!

We had prime rib, salmon, and chicken, and every single guest commented on how great the meal was. Communication with the Wedgewood team throughout the planning process was smooth, and they really listened to what we wanted. We couldn’t have asked for a better experience — highly recommend Redwood Canyon Wedgewood to any couple looking for a stress-free, beautiful wedding day.

g. Planning a reception in a short time frame (we began our first conversation with Ana, our Wedding Planner, on 07/26) could have been stressful, but the Redwood Canyon staff turned it into a smooth and enjoyable experience. From the start, Ana (Wedding Planner) and Liv (Wedding Coordinator) guided us through every detail and kept us completely at ease. On the day of, Aleece (Banquet Captain) led the flow of the event seamlessly, supported by the banquet team — Jovany, Liz, Brandon, and Alina — who provided warm, attentive service throughout the night. Steven (Head Chef) and his kitchen team truly outdid themselves — the food was brilliant, beautifully presented, and they even customized one entrée to our needs, which meant so much to us and our guests. Roberto (Bartender) kept the drinks flowing all night with the top-shelf package. His fast service, great energy, and attention to detail made a huge difference for our guests. DJ Chris was phenomenal — even though he was new to Indian music, he absolutely nailed it and kept the dance floor alive for nearly three hours straight. The décor team made the room look stunning and created a warm, inviting atmosphere. The photographer captured every moment beautifully, and the photo booth was another highlight — our guests had a blast with it and we’ll treasure those memories forever. Even behind the scenes, everyone was thoughtful. The security guard was incredibly helpful, professional, and ensured everything outside the venue went smoothly — something we didn’t think about beforehand but appreciated greatly. From start to finish, the timeline and flow of the evening were perfectly managed. Every last-minute change (including adjustments with tables) was handled with flexibility and care. We walked away with full hearts and endless gratitude. To anyone considering Redwood Canyon: not only is the venue gorgeous, but the staff are what make it truly exceptional. Thank you to Ana, Liv, Aleece, Jovany, Liz, Brandon, Alina, Steven, Roberto, DJ Chris, the décor team, photographer, and security guard — each of you made our night unforgettable.

I could not recommend this venue, or the team enough. We booked in November of 2023, and they made the planning process smooth, and pain free. I never had a question go unanswered...

or had to wait very long for a response. Allison, is a super hero. Quite literally. She was so sweet, knowledgable and came to my rescue in quite literally the final minutes and everything went off without a hitch. & Liz? was the kindest soul I think I may have ever met. She was moving in the shadows making sure that after the hand off things were still smooth sailing. And I swear she had a sixth sense of when we thought of her! Both Allison and Liz made our wedding day stress free, and added a light we didn't know we would miss out on if they hadn't been there. The ceremony space was beautiful, We worked with Officially Yours and got to work with Ken. Whom I was informed that he was a hoot and that everyone enjoyed his entertainment before the big show. We also loved the food! I really believe you could not go wrong with any of the options they offer. But I highly recommend the panko crust chicken! Also worked with iMoblieDj's and had Dj Jaymee - Who we got to meet via Zoom a few days before. We had a very particular request for our ceremony music, in which she pulled off flawlessly. It could not have been more perfect. I will forever recommend this location. But also wedgewood to anyone planning a wedding from here on out! Thank you again Allison and Liz for making our day the best it could have been! Mr & Mrs. Eandi

We wholeheartedly give the Wedgewood Weddings team at Redwood Canyon a 5-star rating! We can’t thank and appreciate Megan, Allison, Liz, the chef, banquet and kitchen staff and th...

e outside vendors enough! We were planning the wedding on a very short timeline – less than five months. So, Wedgewood, and especially our coordinator Allison, made it doable! The ceremony site was absolutely beautiful – we loved the outdoor setting and privacy of the space! And Allison and the staff were so efficient in setting up and taking down. It was just as we had asked it to be. The newly remodeled ballroom looks great! We love the new chandeliers, bar area, flooring and walls! It was great to have such flexibility in laying out how we wanted to use the space. The day of the wedding, Allison set up everything - all of our decorations, photos and signs in the lobby, the check-in table with seven different offerings, and put the menus, favors, and cameras on the guest tables. The food was amazingly delicious – a wonderful extra, rare at a large buffet! Very picky guests raved about how great everything tasted. Big shout out for the prime rib! And the chef was able to accommodate those guests who wanted rare and those who wanted well done. Liz, our Banquet Captain, oversaw the serving of the food and managed the staff for the reception. At the end of the evening, Liz and her staff packed up everything we had brought and the flowers for us, all ready to take home. Wedgewood Weddings has a very defined process which helps move the planning process along. In a few instances, we needed a little extra time on a few decisions, and they were very accommodating. We worked initially with another coordinator and often others would answer emails, etc. They were all very good. Allison, whom we met with for our third meeting, the rehearsal and wedding day, was beyond wonderful! She was so knowledgeable and resourceful! Allison’s experience and guidance was one of the best parts of the whole process. She knows what’s she’s talking about. One of the most helpful aspects of Redwood Canyon was that they have pre-vetted vendors and they were all excellent! We used one of their recommended florists – Dana’s Florist. She was awesome to work with and delivered the most beautiful flower arrangements. She listened to what we wanted and delivered. Likewise, Old Towne Danville Bakery created a stunning cake - just like the photo we shared of what we would like. They have a great way of tasting their cake and filling options too. And the cake was not just beautiful; it was absolutely delicious! The photographers from API seemed to be snapping pictures everywhere and we are eagerly awaiting the photos. (Note: If you choose to have an unplugged ceremony, just know it can take a while before you get to see photos of the ceremony!) The DJ was also very good, MC-ing the whole evening incorporating several special twists we wanted and playing the songs we had requested. All in all, Redwood Canyon was a great choice and we highly recommend them!

Thank you for such a thorough and thoughtful review of your experience at Redwood Canyon! ...

We’re so glad Allison and the whole team were able to help make your wedding happen smoothly, especially with your tight timeline. It’s fantastic to hear the ceremony site and remodeled ballroom were everything you hoped for, and that the food and service impressed both you and your guests. We appreciate you taking the time to share and highly recommending Redwood Canyon, it means so much!

We were recommended the Wedgewood venues by friends and celebrated our wedding at Redwood Canyon 1 month ago. Our wedding coordinator, Liv, as well as the whole team were incredib...

ly friendly, helpful and patient with us, even though the timing was quite tight as we were a binational couple getting married on a K-1 visa, and did not have much time to plan ahead. We had a fairly small wedding, about 30 people, but it was simply magical. The ceremony took place with lovely weather on the outdoors part of the venue at golden hour, allowing for such a scenic moment and great photo opportunities with all of our guests. We then moved on to a reception outdoors. We had a fair amount of custom decoration ideas and these were all arranged together by the team with lovely little touches and in accordance to our wishes. We even had space to play a "first game" of pétanque and jenga which we wanted to do as opposed to a "first dance", and it's been so seamless and so much fun! Very grateful to our DJ Mike (recommended by the venue's team) as well, who worked with a long playlist full of song choices made by ourselves, and arranged it throughout the event to make it so much more "like us". It all worked seamlessly. (PS: My spouse and I got to be driven to the different areas of the venue in a golf car, which was so cute and made a great impression with guests!) The venue received a lot of praise from our loved ones as well, who were able to share this magical moment with us. We highly recommend it across the board: very friendly team, will adapt to your wishes and budget, accomodating for micro-weddings, as well as tight timelines (we planned our wedding over 5 months only). From the bottom of our hearts, thank you so much for making this such a beautiful memory for us. -Yesenia and Agathe

d made the right decision. The team at Redwood Canyon was super easy to work with, and the entire experience felt smooth and stress-free. Wedgewood made wedding planning feel effortless, and we never had to worry about timelines or logistics on the big day — they had it all handled beautifully. Our wedding coordinator, Allison, was absolutely amazing. She was incredibly friendly, fun, thoughtful, and caring — always smiling and bringing great energy to every meeting and moment. On the day of the wedding, she consistently checked in to make sure my fiancé and I had moments to ourselves to relax and soak it all in. She truly went above and beyond. The dressing suite was well-stocked with apps, drinks, champagne, and snacks, which made getting ready even more enjoyable. Our banquet captain, Liz, was also fantastic — friendly, attentive, and made sure the food service ran smoothly from start to finish, including setup, serving, drink pouring, and cleanup. The venue itself was stunning — recently remodeled, with a more modern look that matched our style perfectly. From the ceremony area to the reception decor, everything was just as we envisioned. The quote calculator they provided was super helpful for staying within our budget, and they always responded to our texts and emails promptly. And we were blessed with perfect weather — not too hot, no wind, absolutely gorgeous. It truly couldn’t have been better. Now the food… wow. Our guests are still talking about it! From the delicious appetizers and fresh salads to the pasta with pesto parmesan, cod with tomato vinaigrette, and the perfectly cooked prime rib (especially the middle cut!) — everything was incredible. We received so many compliments about how great the food was. We honestly couldn’t have asked for a better experience. Everyone on the team was kind, responsive, and professional, and they made our wedding day one we’ll never forget. If you're considering Wedgewood Weddings — especially Redwood Canyon — do it! You won't regret it. We highly recommend them!

One word: Perfect. As someone who suffers from severe anxiety, I can honestly say I have never felt more at-ease and confident than while working with the Wedgewood Weddings Redwoo...

d Canyon team -- they always had our backs, kept us on track, and made us feel taken care of. From the first venue visit, during the planning meetings, all the way until the rehearsal and wedding day, the professionalism, clear communication, planning resources, and organized approach made for a seamless experience. We worked with Allison as our Wedding Planner and Coordinator and I firmly believe that she is one of the main reasons our wedding went as incredibly as it did. Redwood Canyon, provides a planning binder as soon as you sign that includes monthly checklists ahead of the wedding to help keep you organized in between planning meetings. It is also filled with valuable information about the wedding planning process, examples, vendor questions, and general guidelines. It helped us structure the planning process without losing the ability to truly personalize our event. Every meeting we had with the planning team was concise, direct, and organized -- it helped us stay on track throughout the process and gave us the opportunity to discuss ideas and ask for advice (which they are also more than happy to give via email). Super responsive and accommodating -- we were so impressed with how easy the process was. We also partnered with their recommended Bakery, DJ, and Florist as part of our vendor team, and the coordination between venue and vendors was absolutely seamless...by the time the week of the wedding rolled around all the main aspects were locked in and we knew the event was in good hands. The wedding day itself was perfect. Allison served as our Day-Of-Coordinator, and together with Jacoby (co-coordinator), Liv (banquet captain), Liz (banquet captain), and rest of the team (cooks, servers, bartenders) we had the most incredible wedding. We arrived at the agreed-upon time on the day of the wedding, and from that moment onwards, the Redwood Canyon team took over to deliver the best experience. They were organized, calm, kept us well hydrated and fed, and kept everything on track for us all night. We were able to confidently hand off the reins -- we didn't have to think of anything all day other than having a good time and enjoying our day as much as possible, trusting that all the logistics were in good hands. Overall, the venue itself was gorgeous. We had our ceremony in the Arbor Lawn, our Reception in the Grand Ballroom (we initially chose the venue primarily because of the dance floor), and rented out the Rose Room for the Cocktail Hour. Everything was included and beautifully decorated with all our desired personal touches, the food and drinks were delicious, and the planning and coordination services must be some of the best in the business. I can't imagine a more incredible experience than what we had and am so thankful for the Redwood Canyon team's care and professionalism -- especially Allison, who we were fortunate enough to work with from first meeting through the day-of. The wedding day went off without a hitch and I couldn't recommend the Redwood Canyon team more <3

This was the single greatest decision we made in the planning process. Wedgewood as a company takes care of so many details while still being entirely customizable all for a reason...

able price. They have different packages you can select from. We chose the middle package, which had the catering, DJ, open bar, coffee/tea, champagne toast, staffing, basic linens, tableware, and fresh floral centerpieces all included in the per head price. The Redwood Canyon location in particular has an incredible team. Everyone is so responsive during the planning process and help to keep you on track with all the details. We had a phenomenal experience from start to finish and I can't speak highly enough of them! Allison and Jacoby were our day of team and they were both incredible! It is a beautiful location with plenty of parking, outdoor ceremony option in a gorgeous enclosed/private garden, and indoor reception hall with a dance floor and plenty of space. Definitely worth a tour at the very least!!

GET MARRIED HERE, FRIEND. We had our wedding at Redwood Canyon on 06/29/2024. I literally have nothing but glowing things to say about our experience. Before we signed our initial ...

contract, I was worried that the pre-packaged wedding experience might turn out to feel generic, but I couldn't have been more wrong. Our wedding looked and felt entirely like us, and the design details we created brought out our unique style in every way. The entire coordination team, along with the affiliated vendors (florals, draping, cake, DJ), were phenomenal. The space was stunning (we also had literally perfect weather and the ceremony site was so beautiful). Our guests RAVED about what a fantastic wedding it was -- multiple told us they felt it was the best food they had ever had at a wedding, and we agreed. Our DJ Ronnie from iMobile DJs understood the assignment perfectly -- we had a fusion Punjabi/Southern American wedding -- and kept our guests on the dance floor until literally midnight even though we had an earlier ceremony in the morning and everyone was exhausted. Our coordinator Allison was so sweet and thoughtful and went above and beyond to make us feel as special and unstressed as possible. Our cake from Old Town Danville Bakery was THE most beautiful and delicious wedding cake I've ever had, and working with Karen was a delight. Our florals were from Dana's Florist and they not only looked INCREDIBLE, it was also so much fun Working with Dana and her staff to design our dream florals, and getting extra florals was not cost prohibitive at all. The fact that we had the wedding of our dreams AND it was less expensive than literally every other option we considered made it even sweeter. Honestly, 10/10. Get married here

I got married here in April of 2022. First off, the grounds and the venue are gorgeous. The planning process was mostly a breeze (minus the DJ) and the staff were very helpful. The food was absolutely delicious. They set up our decor in the banquet hall really well, everything was beautiful. But so many things went wrong. They supply the DJ for you. After trying for months to get in contact with him, he finally reaches out to us a month before the wedding. We told him exactly what we wanted to walk down the aisle to, and he said it would be no problem. Our song was "Home" by Edward Sharpe. It was a song that starts out with some whistling then goes into singing. We told him we wanted the song to either end or loop back around at the end of the first chorus. He said that was no problem. He never sent us the final cut of the song despite us asking multiple times. On the big day as we started walking down the aisle, he played ONLY the whistling part, looped over and over with an abrupt cut in the middle. It sounded awful, so unprofessional, but it was too late. The dressing room is near the back entrance, which I was told would be blocked off and that there would be security directing everyone where to go. Well it wasn't blocked off so several people walked in while I was getting dressed and saw me in my dress before the wedding. I was told that the security guard would lead people into the ceremony section so that they would know where to go and my husband and I would have a little privacy for our "first look" on the golf course. Well that didn't happen either. When I walked out for my first look, I would say about 20 of my guests were standing on the course where we were about to take our first look photos. The security guard was just standing around, not telling people to go sit down so we could have our first look. With all the craziness and stress of getting ready, I forgot my bouquet in the dressing room and realized it right before we were starting the procession. I asked the wedding planner, who was at my side and is provided by Redwood Canyon, if she could go get it. She said no. I said okay I will run back and get it, but she said it was too late and signaled to start the procession. There was nothing I could do so I walked down the aisle without my bouquet that I was so excited for. About halfway through the reception, the wedding planner said she had to leave and someone else would be taking over for her. No one told us that would be happening. I never saw the new planner for the rest of the evening. After dinner, the DJ came up to us and asked us what we should be doing next, and we said we don't know? You don't have a schedule? Where is the wedding planner? He said he didn't have a schedule and he did not know where the planner was. So he just winged it. The whole day was honestly so disappointing. So many things that were important to me, such as the procession song and the first look, were ruined. If I could go back in time, I would not have my wedding here.

of our guests told us that it was the funnest wedding reception they had ever been to. Everything was really organized and flowed seamlessly. The DJ company Wedgewood is contracted with did a really good job with everything, as well. We also loved our photographers from API, the company Wedgewood works with. The food and drinks were great, too. Working with Wedgewood was really smooth and took away some of the stress of wedding planning since they do much of it for you based on your selections. They have reasonable prices. We also had amazing wedding coordinators. Our main coordinator was Mari, and we also worked with Kat. Both were extremely polite and helpful, and the whole team was easy to reach by email whenever we had questions outside of the 3 meetings that we had. The only thing I wish that Wedgewood did that I feel like they didn't really do was tell us to make Save the Date cards early on if we wanted to and give us some options for making them. We didn't end up sending any out, but we did make our invitations through Wedgewood, which went well. I do think that websites like The Knot have more options available for wedding invitations, however, so I recommend to look at other places for invitations to see what fits you best. Overall, Wedgewood was the perfect company for us on planning our wedding, and we would not hesitate to recommend them. It was an amazing day for sure, and Redwood Canyon is a beautiful venue.

It was strange when people asked us how the planning was going, and we said everything was ready to go. Wedgewood takes a lot of the stress away. We only had to worry about decorations, and even then, we just let Wedgewood know what we had, and they could display and make everything work perfectly. We got to work with Kat, and she was amazing! She helped us plan the event, showed us examples, and explained everything well. During rehearsal, she was very helpful and helped us know where we needed to be. On the day of the wedding, she took control and made sure everything ran perfectly. It ended up raining on our wedding day, but Kat kept us updated on the weather and our options available. In the end the ceremony was perfect. During the reception,, Kat was always around to ensure everything was going well and we had everything we needed. It was so nice not having to do anything and being reminded/told what to do. Jovany took over after Kat and he was also great! He made sure we also had everything we needed and took great care of us! Once the event was over I was surprised with how quick they were able to break everything down, Jovany said he could have all of our decorations back to us in 15 minutes and he did it even faster. We have zero regrets on going with Wedgewood! It was money well spent for a very special event. I would highly recommend this venue! Thank you to Kat and Jovany but also everyone else that made everything go so smoothly!

As we were searching for a wedding venue here in the Bay Area we knew what we were looking for-- somewhere that had a nice indoor ballroom area (since the wedding was in the Summer...

), would not be as much work (my wife is working and going through nursing so school so we knew we would have limited time planning), and was affordable-- Redwood Canyon by Wedgewood Weddings was able to meet all of this and exceeded expectations. From our first meeting Adilyne and her team were very friendly, professional, and responsive (would always reply to emails/texts almost immediately). My wife had very specific things that she wanted for the ceremony and reception and Adilyne was able to bring this vision to life. She was very detailed in helping us prepare for the big day with checklists and check in's that made sure we didn't fall behind in the planning. She was also able to provide us with creative ideas when we weren't exactly sure how we wanted something. One of the things that we really loved about Wedgewood is that they have their own vendors that they provided that really had an understanding of the venue and what worked/wouldn't work (i.e. DJ (Jeremiah) knew exactly how to setup everywhere and we didn't have to worry about mic/sound issues, bakery (Karen from Danville Bakery) was very knowledgeable about venue and already knew how to work with our florist (Dana) to get us the cake decorated the way we wanted it; photographer/videographer were familiar with when the sun was going to set and knew the best places to take all of our bridal party photos and sunset photos). This immediate chemistry between the vendors made the planning process and the day of the wedding very smooth. When it came to the day of the wedding, our vendors all did an amazing job and rarely had any questions for us other than what our vision was for certain things. If anything, they were the experts on the day/venue and provided us with the support and guidance that we needed even when things didn't go exactly according to schedule. Adilyne did a great job making sure to check in on the bride and groom while also making sure everything ran very smoothly. When we had any requests, Adilyne took care of it immediately. By the end of the night when she had left for the evening, Liz took over and did a great job in making sure that everything continued to move smoothly while also making sure all of our items were packed up nicely (they also loaded everything onto a cart for me so it was very easy to load my car the next morning). All in all we had an amazing wedding and were able to enjoy our days with family/friends with little to no hiccups. We are very grateful for the experience and would highly recommend to anyone!

our questions. Mari also followed up with us after our tour and she was able to stay connected to answer all our questions via email. I sent them sooo many emails with questions and the team always responded quickly and in a friendly manner to include Kat (who is part of the team). The planning process was less stressful with our Redwood Canyon team than what it would have been alone. They focused on the big stuff so we can focus on the smaller details. Our guests gave us many compliments on our ceremony site and venue all together. Our florists Danas Florals, which work with the venue went above and beyond in their professionalism, communication and caring. Dana was always there to answer all my questions and you can tell she wanted to make my vision a reality, which she did! I was in love with my flowers, they were so fresh and everything I wanted. The color pallet she created was EVERYTHING. In addition, she was extremely flexible in the planning process doing everything via email since we lived about two hours away from the venue. We loved loved Mari, and Liz they were AMAZING and professional. Couldn't ask for anyone more understanding, patient, friendly, flexible and kind than they were. These two were on point with making us feel taken care of and checking in on us every step of the way. They listened to our needs as a couple and made things happen. Our guests noticed how great they were too because they mentioned it to us. I felt like everything was under control with Mari by my side and later Liz. As a bride and groom, we connected with our Coordinator and Banquet Captain, and that is essential. I felt like Mari and Liz genuinely care about our special day and making everything run smoothly to make us happy. Any couple who has Mari and Liz in the future are in great hands, you can tell they care about their role and the bride and groom. Andy our API photography was EXCEPTIONAL, I mean wow, from his professionalism to his easy going demeaner to his creativity, he was a dream to work with! So happy it was Andy and Emily (his assistant was also great and sweet). Cannot wait to see our pictures. Both so attentive and open to what we wanted as a couple for pictures and willing to work with us.

a wedding. After we chose Redwood Canyon, all I really had to do was create a vision. Then slowly I bought the decor but wedgewood literally did the rest. I gave everything to our Coordinator Adilyne (who was quite literally, the best coordinator a girl could ask for) and she did everything exactly how I imagined it. The day was absolutely perfect and I cannot recommend Wedgewood enough. Some things they definitely nickel and dime you on ($400 for fog machine, $550 for draping, $750 for “upgraded” chairs) but honestly, you save sooo much money in the long run.

wood Weddings. BEST idea EVER!!!! Our experience with this talented group of professionals was better than we could have imagined! We gave them one month to put together everything and they did it with precision and excellence! If it sounds like an exaggeration, it isn't. They handled it all: set-up, decorations, vendors (officiant, bakery, flowers, DJ), keeping the bride in "bridal mode" (versus worrying over guests), keeping the groom "chill", and let's not forget the food and beverages! All of the guests (also NOT an exaggeration) have told us how wonderful our wedding was and what a wonderful time they had. We chose the buffet meal with carving station - and we have yet to have anyone tell us they didn't like the food. The signature cocktails we put together were EXCELLENT!!! Great bartender! I have already recommended Wedgewood Weddings to friends with engaged children. This is one venue where a 5-star rating is guaranteed to be well-deserved!

We had barely 8 weeks to plan our wedding… remotely! It was a destination wedding for us and we live overseas. We got to physically see the place and meet with the organizers only ...

10 days before but they were so organized and our zoom meetings were always productive. Every detail was covered so the day of the wedding was absolutely stress-free and we were pampered all throughout, from the time we arrived at the holding room until the reception ended. Although I didn’t get to do a tasting of the food, most of our guests raved about it. Everything just fell into place. I thought it was near impossible to plan a wedding from thousands of miles away but their team made it happen. They made our wedding just perfect!

My experience from the scheduling of the first tour, all the way through to the end of my wedding night was 99% amazing. (I'll get to that 1% in a moment.) The way that Wedgewood h...

andles so much in-house made it incredibly easy to keep track of everything that needed to be arranged, fewer vendors I had to keep track of, and it made the budgeting process simpler. Any time I sent an email with anything from one to twelve questions (or more!), I received a prompt, thorough, and friendly response. As a first-time bride and someone who has had the luxury of being a bridesmaid to low-maintenance brides, I had very little experience with the whole wedding process and there was so much involved that I didn't know a thing about until I started planning my own. Not only did they provide excellent support from beginning to end, but their whole system is designed to make it as stress-free and organized as possible. I want to extend a HUGE thanks to our coordinator Mari, our banquet manager Jovany, our servers Manuel and Thea, as well as our bartender Roberto. They were all excellent and really went above and beyond to make our wedding day spectacular! Okay, so as for that 1%. I do have a complaint about the security. Wedgewood automatically added a $300 security charge to our bill, which seemed perfectly reasonable. However, we had one security guard and she spent the entire wedding in her car, on her phone, parked outside the back entrance. At one point, a bridesmaid left the locking bridal suite door open and my maid of honor found guests in there lounging on the couch. Now, realistically, there was not a single person in attendance that I didn't know personally and trust, but the entire wedding party had left phones, purses, wallets, etc. in that room so I didn't want anyone who wasn't explicitly given the code to be going in and out, plus my dog was crated in there and it was stressing her out. Of course, we didn't expect security to memorize the faces of everyone allowed in there, however, my maid of honor is a highly non-confrontational person and wanted assistance in asking these guests to leave the bridal suite. After searching for the security guard with no luck, she eventually had to ask the bartender Roberto for assistance. (Thank you, Roberto!) I did include this issue in my survey that Wedgewood sent me after the wedding and was also highly disappointed that I didn't hear anything back from them about this issue at all. Honestly, I think a refund of the security fee should be offered, but I would have been happy with at least an acknowledgement of the issue. In my mind, we paid for a service that we never received. But yikes, I'm letting my rant run away on me! Overall, I really cannot recommend Wedgewood highly enough, hence the 5-star review despite having one gripe. The venue was beautiful, food was delicious, and all other service was top-notch. If you choose Wedgewood for your wedding, you will not be disappointed!

, simply saved our wedding from the fate of being delayed by the flood and wind in the bay area. Kat helped reached out to vendors and coordinated a venue change so our wedding can happen on-time. On top of that, the vendors selected by wedgewood is very professional and amazing. We really enjoy the flowers and the cakes. Wedgewood is the only package that we can find within our budget.

Absolutely wonderful experience. I can’t imagine how stressful planning a wedding must be *outside* Wedgewood. Everything is set up to make the process easy and enjoyable with so m...

any ways to customize your day to exactly how you imagined it would be. The staff from day one were attentive, personable, and treated us like friends. A huge shoutout to our day-of coordinator Kat for all her help to ensure we were supported, happy, and in a position where we had ZERO stress. Furthermore, the pep talk she gave our daughter (8yo) when her nerves got the best of her right before the ceremony (she was our flower girl) meant so much. This day wasn’t just for us, it was for her too, so having the same level of care put into her experience will be something I will not forget. Our Captain, Liz was also phenomenal and made sure we had everything we needed and wanted for the day. To the rest of the staff, you are all amazing. From every detail we had the PERFECT wedding. To anyone considering Wedgewood… DO IT! And don’t forget to add the Grand Sparkler entrance!!

Redwood Canyon was the best decision we made in the entire wedding planning process. We went with the premiere package and got everything taken care of through Wedgewood -- food, d...

rinks, cake, flowers, Save the Dates + invitations, and DJ were all included in this package. It was WONDERFUL! We worked with a few different planners up until the final month when we were assigned to Mari. Everyone at Wedgewood was amazing, they all knew the answers to our questions so quickly, and were absolute experts from day 1. We felt so taken care of with them. Mari was a DREAM as our day-of coordinator, and Jovany was so kind and helpful as our Banquet Host the rest of the evening. We couldn't have asked for a better group of people to help us make our wedding special. We got our flowers through The Flower Shop, which is Wedgewood's flower vendor. Erica was awesome! She made the most beautiful cascading bouquet for me that took my breath away. Everyone's bouquets and boutineers were so lovely. Our Wedgewood package included centerpieces and a piece for our sweet heart table, and we paid for the bouquets for the bridal party, bridal bouquet, and boutineers. It was very reasonable in price! We were so happy with Erica from The Flower Shop's work. Wedgewood uses Danville Bakery for their wedding cakes which is what we used. I will say I was nervous because they didn't respond to our email confirming cake flavors for a while, BUT they are working on weddings, and are busy. We heard from them a week before our wedding, confirming our flavors and cake size. Not only was the cake was gorgeous, it tasted amazing! We even swung by there a week after the wedding to get some other baked goods because we loved them so much at the wedding. Our DJ was Joseph and he was fantastic. Their company sent us an online form to fill out with music for every step of the process. It was so easy to fill out, and any music not listed on their system we were able to add via email or Spotify playlist. Joseph had a call with us the week before the wedding to confirm everything, and sent us spotify links to create playlists of our "Must Play" songs and our cocktail hour / dinner music. It was so easy, and Joseph had an amazing energy that radiated in the space. We loved him! Living in the bay area, I've known people who have spent a lot of money on their weddings. It's understandable. Our wedding planning process was not only made easier with Wedgewood, but it also helped us a lot because we were able to save money (and time) by not having to go to outside vendors. Not only did we save money and time by going with Wedgewood, we also had a really beautiful venue with an amazing crew of people. We were so delighted by our experience with Redwood Canyon by Wedgewood Weddings, and I will continue to recommend them to everyone getting married!

My wife and I got married at Redwood Canyon in September and we are so happy we chose this venue. The ceremony site is secluded and intimate. The courtyard is spacious and wonderfu...

lly lit by strings of market lights. But most of all, the Wedgewood team was what made our day one to remember. Mari was our lead coordinator, and she made the entire process from venue intros to wedding day so easy. On the day of, Mari went above and beyond to make sure our ceremony and reception went smoothly. A few examples include celebratory drinks after our recessional, a selection of appetizers to snack on between photos, coordinating onsite transport for our elderly guests, and so much more. I also wanted to give a recognition to the catering team who prepared an allergy free meal for one of young guest using separate pans and utensils and confirming the preparation details with the parents. TLDR: The venue is great, but the team is even better.

know that this venue also has the most amazing and kindest staff members :) All the ladies were so helpful throughout the planning process in answering my questions and responding to my emails. I loved how easy it was to work with all of them. Every time I reached out with a question, I'd get a response within couple of hours. Most importantly, everyone was so friendly and kind. I planned my wedding day and all the details without a planner with just the staff's support. We were lucky to get an awesome day of Coordinator - Mari and Banquet Manager. Food was delicious, and we kept getting so many compliments. Everything went so well and flowed smoothly on my wedding day. I also highly recommend their Bakery which came with the package. Karen was lovely to work with and she turned my inspiration photos exactly how I wanted. If I had to go back in time and plan my wedding all over again would choose this venue and this lovely team in a heartbeat :)
