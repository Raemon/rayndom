ry reasonable prices. All my guest raved about the food and how awesome the staff was. I would choose Callippe over and over. They also do free family holiday events there which is a fun way to visit the venue before and after your wedding there. Receptions have a hard cut off of 10:30pm which was my only con, but after an evening of open bar, I feel it was a good cut off before people over indulged. They offer so much with your venue pricing and cut out a ton of the small worries for me. Morgan is very detail oriented and took note of all my details so my decor was set up perfectly. The view is breathtaking and will definitely wow your guest. I wish golfers were a little more respectful. We had hooting and hollering during our vows. Not Callippes fault but was so disrespectful of those men. Overall I am extremely happy with my choice to use Callippe for my wedding.

gether. We were absolutely in love with the food, service, and setting and our guests were as well. They worked extremely well with our price point and catered to everything we needed, including signature drinks, decorations, and including last minute rentals such as fire pits for our guests. They are prompt in responding and did everything with a smile on their face. As someone in Events herself, Morgan and the team absolutely were a delight to work with and I would happily recommend Callippe to any couple for a good experience and stellar service.

cannot rave more about the experience. When it comes to planning weddings, Callippe is a well oiled machine and will make the entire experience completely stress free!! Callippe provides so much of what you need for a wedding-- the food, alcohol, tables, chairs, linens, arbor, floral, coordinator, BEAUTIFUL scenery, set up, etc. (All info is easily found on their website which makes it so easy! Including pricing) The food is not what you would expect from a golf course wedding. The food was INSANELY good. So many of my guests are still texting me saying it was the best wedding food they ever had!! We did the prime rib, chicken piccata, pesto pasta, garlic mash potatoes, green beans for dinner. DROOLING thinking back to it. The pricing of the whole Callippe experience is a STEAL. I couldn't believe what we got for what we paid for. I truly don't think there's a better venue out there. I could go on and on. I will always be incredibly thankful that I found this venue and will hold it close to my heart forever. Thank you to Morgan and Charissa for making our wedding day the best day of our lives!!!!

I am beyond thrilled with how perfect callippe was for our reception. Morgan was amazing to work with over the course of many months and my many questions and random requests. In ...

the middle of ALL THE STRESSORS leading up to our ceremonies, Morgan's flexibility and empathy was a breath of fresh air. She was super organized and didn't judge me for being all over the place! Also...our bridal suite was setup with appetizers and beverages!! Now, onto Charissa....Charissa (F&B Manager) didn't say no to ANY of my random food and Bev requests. She found a way to accommodate everything I'd asked for. The day of the event, a few of my guests arrived late (after dinner)...Charissa went in and freshly prepared more of all the entrees for them!!! My guests were beyond impressed with the venue, views, hospitality, food (passed appetizers during cocktail hour and dinner), and beverages!!! All of the staff even beyond these two were amazing and super friendly!!! Here are some other random perks that I didn't even anticipate....all of the bride's and groom's drinks past our open bar were on the house!! Plus...they brought us (bride and groom) a heaping plate full of dinner while the guests were being led to the buffet area!

It gave us a lot less decisions to make and everything was really well done (TexMex food option was a big hit), plus they gave us plenty of room to add our own personal touches.

Callippe was the perfect venue for our Irish-themed wedding. The breathtaking green scenery was gorgeous, and the configuration of the ceremony and reception area was terrific for ...

our live band. Guests enjoyed the food and ambiance-- it was a great party! Tiffany and Claudia at Callippe were a joy to work with in coordinating and executing the event. The only downsides were that some guests got cold after dark because the whole event was outdoors (though there are ample heaters on the covered reception deck), and the reception setup seemed a bit disorganized-- my friends had to make sure everything was arranged correctly, and the cake flowers delivered by the florist got lost somehow. But these were minor things-- the wedding pretty much went off without a hitch, and we have gorgeous photos from that day! Also, we had a limited budget, and they worked with us to create an event we were thrilled with. I would highly recommend Callippe!

at the site. The ceremony was overlooking the the golf course and the reception was on their patio. The food was awesome! We received compliments on our menu choices. My family and friends loved their prime rib and thought it was roasted perfectly. The atmosphere is just what we wanted. They also allow you to go on the golf course to take photos. Just be mindful of the golfers. Callippe also fit our budget which is a big plus.
