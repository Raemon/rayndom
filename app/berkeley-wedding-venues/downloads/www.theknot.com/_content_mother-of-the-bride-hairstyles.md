Still on the hunt for [wedding hairstylist](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/beauty-services)?

## Mother-of-the-Bride Hair Tips From the Experts

What do the pros have to say about mother-of-the-bride hair? Read on for advice to guide you as you [choose a wedding hairstyle](https://www.theknot.com/content/choosing-a-wedding-day-hairstyle). 

### Understand Your Hair Type

Picking a style that's right for you starts with understanding your [hair type](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-hair-type-tips), thickness and texture. "You can determine your hair texture by looking at a single strand and comparing it to a piece of thread," says Paul. "Is your hair thicker or thinner than the thread? If thinner, then your texture is fine. If around the same width, you have a medium hair texture. If thicker, then you have a thicker hair texture." If you have fine hair or thinning hair, speak with your hair stylist about ways to add volume and get their advice about the styles that will, and won't, hold up throughout the wedding.

### Consider Your Mother-of-the-Bride Dress 

The style you've selected for your [mother-of-the-bride dress](https://www.theknot.com/content/mother-of-bride-dresses-available-now) should influence your mother-of-the-bride hair decisions. "I advise clients to think about their entire look," says Paul. "Do they want to go along with the aesthetic or theme of the wedding? Do they want to look trendy or classically chic? Then, based on their wedding attire, we create a hairstyle that will highlight their best features and flatter their hair type."

Pay specific attention to the [dress neckline](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-gown-neckline-glossary) of your mother-of-the-bride dress as that'll affect which mother-of-the-bride hair ideas will be most flattering and functional as part of your ensemble. For example, "if you are wearing a strapless dress with the intent of showing off more skin, then go with an updo that will accentuate that choice," Paul says. If your dress has a high neckline, show it off with a fancy mother-of-the-bride updo. 

### Consider the Style and Formality of the Wedding

What [wedding style](https://www.theknot.com/wedding-vision) has the couple selected? The look and feel of the wedding your daughter is planning should inform how formal, or informal, your hairstyle is. For example, an updo works well for a black-tie wedding while loose curls would look nice at a semi-formal event. 

### Focus on Comfort and Confidence 

At the end of the day, Paul's biggest suggestion is to style your hair in a way that makes you feel confident. "I recommend to clients that they pick a hairstyle that suits their personalities and is going to make them look and feel beautiful." He also recommends staying away from experimentation on your daughter's wedding day. "Don't try something completely new for the wedding. You want to look like an elevated version of yourself and not feel self-conscious about your new hairstyle."

### Schedule a Mother-of-the-Bride Hair Trial

If you're having your [mother-of-the-bride makeup](https://www.theknot.com/content/mother-of-the-bride-makeup) or hair professional done then a trial is paramount. "The mother of the bride should absolutely schedule a [hair trial](https://www.theknot.com/content/prep-for-hair-and-makeup-trial)," Paul advises. "The last thing you want to do as the mother of the bride is stress over your appearance the day of, or worse, not be happy with how your hair looks on the big day." Schedule the trial a few months before the wedding, after you've chosen your gown. Come to your trial with a photo of your dress, or better yet, a photo of you in the dress. This will help your stylist tweak the final look." If you aren't into the hairstyle your stylist creates, it's ok to politely speak up and ask for changes or adjustments. That's what the trial run is for.

## Elegant Mother-of-the-Bride Updos

[Wedding updos](https://www.theknot.com/content/updos-for-long-hair) are a mother-of-the-bride hairstyle favorite for a reason: they're timeless, durable and versatile. Keep reading for some of our favorite hairstyles for ladies over 50 that feel anything _but_ matronly. 

If you decide on an updo, keep this advice in mind ahead of the wedding: wash and dry your hair the day before the wedding, and come to your stylist with one-day-old, washed hair," Paul says. "The additional grit from one day will add nice texture to the strands and modernize a classic look. 

### Find your kind of venue

From barns to ballrooms, discover reception venues that feel like you.

### 1\. High-Bun Updo for Mother of the Bride




![High bun elegant mother of the bride hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/e4214877-91d5-4648-9963-e0d02edacd6d~rs_768.h-cr_853.291.2551.1989)

If you're on the hunt for [formal hairstyles](https://www.theknot.com/content/formal-hairstyles), keep this look in mind. The mom's stylist curled her hair before putting it into a high bun to add texture and volume. The style is a great choice because, like with her daughter's updo, the open back of her dress gets its moment in the sun. 

### 2\. Chic Double-Braid Mother-of-the-Bride Updo

Looking for a fun and unexpected updo idea? This mom's crown-like hairstyle is made up of two braids that meet at the back and form a halo, of sorts, atop her head. 

### 3\. Low-Bun With Flowers for Mother of the Bride




![Low bun with flowers elegant mother of the bride hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/0a5648d7-e4d8-427d-82f3-e5770f3e6d59~rs_768.h-cr_514.94.2375.1955)

Updos are a smart [hairstyle for one-shoulder dresses](https://www.theknot.com/content/hairstyles-for-one-shoulder-dresses). With your hair down, you'd constantly be fidgeting with it to keep it away from your dress. Thankfully, with an updo that isn't an issue. 

### 5\. Sophisticated Mother-of-the-Bride Top Knot

We see you, mama. These curls are glamorous while still being short enough to show off the stunning mother of the bride dress. "Try curling some of the hair away from the face to add movement and ensure that everyone can see your smiling face during the day," Paul says.

### 46\. Short and Straight Wedding Hair for Mom With Side Part




![Short and straight mother of the bride hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/30f3796e-b4f5-450b-ba9c-b92d3c8e401c~rs_768.h-cr_141.464.1120.1443)

_[Photo: Lovisa Photo](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/lovisa-photo-orange-ca-479282)_

This hairstyle brought the best of both worlds—it was short around the mom's neck to keep her hair off her shoulders, but the bangs brought length that could be styled in fresh, inventive ways. This is a good option if you want a no-fuss wedding hair idea as a mom. 

### 47\. Voluminous Blowout for Mom With Short Hair




![Mother helps her daughter get ready for her wedding day. ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/b0bc33d9-b31c-42e0-9e71-a2a6898641fa~rs_768.h-cr_407.435.1220.1248)

How beautiful does this mom of the bride look? There's nothing quite like a beautiful blowout, even with short hair. To DIY this mother-of-the-bride hair simply use a round brush and blow-dry your hair up and back. Keep it in place and out of your face with a volumizing hairspray.

### 48\. Asymmetrical Bob Hairstyle for Mom of the Bride 




![Asymmetrical bob mother of the bride hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/5eabd712-76d4-46bf-8db7-55a024ad3e8e~rs_768.h-cr_169.158.1205.1194)

_[Photo: Glorious Moments Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/glorious-moments-photography-atlanta-ga-993117)_

This mom's straight bob perfectly frames her beautiful face. For this look, Paul recommends washing and drying your hair the day _of_ the wedding so it's fresh and bouncy. 

### 49\. Simple Pixie Cut for Mom's Wedding Hair
