My organization hosted a high end fundraiser at Turn 11, and it exceeded every expectation. Venue: The space itself is spectacular, and uniquely designed in a way that can either...

be a completely blank canvas, or impressive on its own with minimal decor. The patio has a stunning view of the wine country hills and provides a natural photo backdrop for guests. Parking is easy to navigate with plenty of spaces. We really appreciated all the A/V options, as it seamlessly fit our sound and visual needs. Catering: Guests were thrilled with the food and beverage. The catering team acknowledged and communicated all my requests beforehand, and provided creative solutions to accommodate our budget. The team ensured the evening flowed seamlessly from start to finish, which allowed me to step back and enjoy my guests and the event. I highly recommend Turn 11 at Sonoma Raceway, and look forward to hosting another event in the future.
