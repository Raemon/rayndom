Hair extensions are a great way to transform your look, whether that's for an extended period of time or just a special event. Before you spring for them, though, it's important to know: How long do hair extensions last? This is especially true if you're getting them for your wedding night—you want them to look great the night of, and if you're heading out for a honeymoon right after, you probably want them to last through that as well. 

There are so many different types of hair extensions to choose from, and the one you pick should ultimately be a good fit with your reason for getting them. Here's a look at everything there is to know about how long hair extensions will last. 

**In this article:**

  * How Long Do Hair Extensions Last, By Type
  * Tips for Long-Lasting Hair Extensions
  * When Should I Get Hair Extensions Before My Wedding?



## How Long Do Hair Extensions Last, By Type

Determining how long your hair extensions will last depends on the type of hair extension you're getting—human or synthetic—and the method of application. All hair extensions will need to be repositioned (or moved up) at some point, which means they need to be moved closer to the scalp in order to maintain a realistic and natural look. Some application methods will allow you to wait months before you have to reposition them, while others need to be moved in a few weeks.

### How long do tape-in hair extensions last?

Tape-in hair extensions are semi-permanent and consist of thin, pre-taped wefts (a fine strip of cloth with hair strands woven in) that are placed between sections of your natural hair. "They lie flat, blend seamlessly and are lightweight, making them a popular choice for adding length and volume without excessive damage," explains Vicki Casciola, [hairtalk](https://hairtalkusa.com/) artistic director. Casciola adds that these can last up to six to eight weeks before they need to be repositioned closer to the scalp. If properly taken care of, they can last up to eight to 10 months (note this will require some maintenance). 

### How long do clip-in hair extensions last?

Unlike semi-permanent and permanent extensions, clip-in hair extensions do not require help from a professional and are removed nightly. These are individual wefts with clips attached to them that you clip into your hair against your scalp to add instant volume and [hair length](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-hair-type-tips). You can wear clip-in extensions for hours or throughout the entire day, but they do have to be removed before you go to sleep, so they aren't worn 24/7. However, Casciola says that with proper care, they can be used for six months to up to a year—and high-quality options may last even longer. 

### How long do sew-in hair extensions last?

Sew-in hair extensions, also known as weave-in hair extensions, are applied to your head by a professional who braids your natural hair into cornrows, then sews the wefts onto the braids using a needle and thread. This is an extremely popular method of permanent hair extensions and can last for six to eight weeks before requiring a repositioning. "With proper maintenance and care they can last up to a year," Casciola says. 

### How long do beaded weft hair extensions last?

Beaded weft hair extensions (sometimes also known as hand-tied hair extensions) are similar to sew-in hair extensions. They are wefts that are attached to your hair with silicone lined beads, without the use of glue, heat or tape, which makes them much less damaging to your scalp and hair. They can last six to eight weeks before they need to be moved up and can last up to a year with the right care. 

### How long do weave-in hair extensions last?

Weave-in extensions are similar to sew-in extensions, says [Tabitha Osman](https://www.havenholisticsalon.com/), hairstylist and holistic trichologist. "They specifically refer to the process of sewing wefts into natural hair for added volume and length," she explains. Weave-in extensions can last six to eight weeks with proper care and maintenance. 

### How long do weft hair extensions last?

A weft is a piece of cloth with strands of hair woven into it and can sometimes be referred to as a weave or tape. Weft hair extensions are used in options like sew-in extensions, tape extensions and clip-in extensions. According to Osman, there are several types of wefts. "Some are machine-sewn and bulkier at the top, while higher quality wefts are thinner and stacked in rows to hide the beads, the foundation to which the hair is attached," she says. Thinner wefts allow for more customization and reduce weight on natural hair. Wefts are reusable and can last between six months and up to a year with proper care. 

### How long do fusion hair extensions last?

Fusion hair extensions can be a lot more permanent than some other options. These are individual strands bonded to natural hair using a keratin-based adhesive and heat. Casciola notes that they typically last three to six months depending on hair growth and maintenance. 

### How long do permanent hair extensions last?

Permanent hair extensions are more of a category of extensions and include options like fusion extensions, tape-in extensions and sew-in extensions. "They can last several months, with ongoing maintenance required throughout," Osman says, noting that some techniques, like sew-ins and fusion, can last weeks to months between maintenance sessions. "For hair prosthetics like full toppers or mesh integration systems used to cover the top of the head, these require reapplication every two to three weeks, with full reinstallation every six to eight weeks," she adds. 

### How long do Bellami hair extensions last?

Bellami is a popular brand that makes a variety of different hair extensions, including keratin tips, I-tips and different weft options. Made of 100% virgin Remy human hair, Bellami hair extensions are considered higher quality. According to the [brand](https://www.bellamiprofessional.com/pages/virgin-remy-hair-faq), their extensions should last six to 12 months with the proper care and maintenance. Remember that how they are applied to the hair will depend on how often they need to be repositioned. 

**Price at time of publication:** From $75

### How long do synthetic hair extensions last?

Synthetic hair extensions are made of artificial materials such as acrylic, nylon or polyester. These strands are heated and manipulated to look and feel like real hair, but they're not. Because synthetic hair extensions are not real hair, they don't have the same movement or shine as human hair extensions and are more obvious when worn. "Do not use these," warns Kate Johnson, professional hair and makeup artist, co-founder of [Glossed Finishing Studio](https://www.glossed.com/) and founder of [The Bridal Beauty Team](https://www.thebridalbeautyteam.com/). "They cannot be curled at all because they will melt." They usually last one to three months but can last for about three to four months, although they require more maintenance. 

### How long do human hair extensions last?

Human hair extensions are made from a variety of different human hair and are preferred since they look and feel just like real hair (because they're made of real hair!). When properly cared for, human hair extensions can last up to a year, although the method of applying them will determine how often they need to be repositioned. 

### How long do Luxy hair extensions last?

Luxy is another popular brand of hair extensions that uses human hair to create extensions such as clip-ins and fill-ins. They should last three to six months with proper care, but how you use them and apply them will affect how long they'll last. 

**Price at time of publication:** From $255

### How long do Ktip extensions last?

Also known as keratin tip extensions, these are a more permanent type of hair extension. "This is a keratin tip attached to hair that is melted onto your own hair in small sections," Johnson explains. "This will last up to a year, but is the most expensive and can take up to five hours to do." 

### How long do I-tip extensions last?

I-tip extensions are applied strand by strand using a small bead or clamp to secure the extension to your natural hair. "The 'I-tip' refers to the shape of the extension at the top where it's attached," Osman notes—this is what makes them different from similar options. They don't require heat or glue, and can last two to three months with proper care. 

### How long do CombLine extensions last?

"The [CombLine technique with hairtalk extensions](https://hairtalkusa.com/pages/the-academy-at-hairtalk?intcmp=HPBanner_CombLine) is a method that uses a fine-tooth comb tool to seamlessly integrate tape-in extensions closer to the scalp for a more natural blend," Casciola explains. "We use it as an enhancement for hair." These can typically last six to eight weeks before they need to be repositioned. 

## Tips for Long-Lasting Hair Extensions 

Depending on the quality and how well you care for them, human hair extensions can last for about a year. The method of application affects how often they'll need to be repositioned, but you can still use them regularly without replacing them for months. In order to do that, though, you need to take care of them correctly, just as you would with your own hair. 

### Opt for the Longest Lasting Hair Extensions

If you want to get your hair extensions a few weeks before your wedding, both Casciola and Johnson say that beaded weft hair extensions are their long-lasting pick. Casciola likes that they are lightweight and flexible, with microbeads that don't add too much tension to the scalp, and Johnson calls them very easy to reposition. 

When in doubt, look for higher quality options. "The quality of the hair purchased is directly related to how long the extension hair will last," Osman says. "When you invest in high-quality extensions, you're getting a much longer lifespan." She likes hand-tied extensions (such as active wefts) that can last up to a year with proper care, as well as tape-in extensions and I-tip extensions.

### Use the Right Products 

For hair extensions that stay in your hair (aka not clip-ins), you need to be mindful of the products you're using. "The proper shampoo and conditioner is key," Johnson says. "Since the oils from our scalp won't be hydrating them like they do your own hair, you must make sure they are conditioned well." Casciola recommends avoiding sulfate or alcohol-based products, which she says "strip moisture and weaken bonds, leading to dryness and slippage." You should also avoid oily products, since oils and heavy conditioners at the roots can loosen tapes or bonds. "Keep products focused on mid-lengths and ends," Casciola advises. 

### Brush Gently 

You should be brushing your hair regularly, but Casciola says to be extra careful. She recommends using a soft-bristle brush or a loop brush to prevent tangling and breakage, and starting from the ends and working up. 

### Keep Clips and Accessories Away From Extensions

When you have extensions, be careful about putting hair clips and other accessories too close to them. Osman recommends avoiding claw clips or even ponytails near the extensions, saying "tying your hair too tightly near the extensions can put unnecessary strain on your natural hair or damage the top of the extensions." She recommends looser hairstyles that don't create tension at the bonds. You should also be aware of pushing sunglasses on top of your head. "The pressure from sunglasses or other accessories over the extensions can cause them to shift or damage the attachment points, leading to discomfort or hair damage," Osman says. 

### Take Extra Care at Night

Develop something of a hair care routine before you go to bed each night. Johnson recommends braids while sleeping so that the extensions don't tangle, while Casciola says a braid or a loose ponytail is a good idea. She recommends using a silk pillowcase to reduce friction as you're tossing and turning. She also says to never sleep on wet extensions, which can cause matting and weaken bonds and tape. 

### Avoid Too Much Heat Styling 

Too much heat styling—think a curling iron or straightener—can be just as damaging to extensions as it can to real hair. If you're going to use hot tools, Casciola says to keep them on the low setting and always apply a heat protectant to help prevent damage. 

### Keep Up With Regular Maintenance 

"If using semi-permanent extensions, like tape-ins or sew-ins, visit a stylist every six to eight weeks for adjustments," Casciola says. If your stylist tells you to come in after a set amount of time for repositioning, listen to them—otherwise, your extensions can not only look less natural, but they may become damaged and need to be replaced. 

### Protect Them in the Water

Planning on swimming with extensions in? That's fine, but you do need to be a little extra careful. "If you're going into a pool, you will want to make sure you put in a leave-in conditioner first to fill the cuticle with hydration before the chlorine fills it," Johnson says. 

### Store Clip-Ins Properly 

Clip-in hair extensions need to be removed from your head each night before you go to sleep, which means that you need to store them correctly. Casciola recommends keeping them tangle-free in a silk bag or hanging on a hanger. 

## When Should I Get Hair Extensions Before My Wedding? 

A lot of brides choose to get [hair extensions for their wedding](https://www.theknot.com/content/types-of-hair-extensions) since they can add volume, make certain styles more attainable and look more appealing in photos. However, timing is everything. Osman recommends that brides get their extensions done two to three weeks before the wedding. "This gives enough time for any adjustments or blending after the initial install and allows the bride to ask their hairstylist any questions or concerns that might arise post-install," she explains. 

When you get them can also depend on the type of extensions you're getting. For example, clip-ins are super temporary, and you would put them in the day of. To find the best option for you, think about all the details. "Consider the extension type, maintenance needs and longevity—especially if wearing them through the honeymoon," Casciola says. 

If your hair trial is booked months before your wedding date, you may want to get extensions before then so you can see what your [wedding hairstyle](https://www.theknot.com/content/choosing-a-wedding-day-hairstyle) will look like with them. However, you can also use clip-ins for the trial, even if you don't plan on using them moving forward. 

For brides who want to wear their extensions through their honeymoon, it's important to think about how they will be maintained in different conditions. "For example, if they're heading to the beach or pool, extra preparation is needed before submerging their hair in saltwater or chlorine to prevent damage," Osman notes. 

Anyone who wants extensions for a specific event, including wedding guests, should also try getting them one to two weeks beforehand. Keep in mind that hair extensions need to be ordered, so take shipping times into consideration. And for those who don't want to make a commitment, clip-ins are a great option.
