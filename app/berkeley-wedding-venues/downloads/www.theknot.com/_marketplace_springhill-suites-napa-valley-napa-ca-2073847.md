We had an excellent stay here while visiting Napa! The staff went above and beyond. When we arrived, we were greeted by Madison who did an excellent job getting us all checked in and squared away. After we had checked out, I called because I t...

hought I had left my ID there. The staff double checked the rooms to see if it was there and gave us a call back a few hours later to inform us they did not find it. We ended up finding the ID later on in one of our pockets. But usually in a situation like this the hotel does not even call you back. I really appreciate that even after we checked out, they still continued to help us. The room was clean and comfortable for our stay. I like the SpringHills still give you the option to have complimentary breakfast here in the mornings. The hotel itself is very nice. Parking is easy, the lobby is very pretty, and the outdoor area was pretty too. They were renovating the pool while we were there, but it would have been too cold to swim anyway so nothing got missed out on. We would definitely stay here again!

I only stayed for one night, but it was such a lovely experience! From the moment I arrived, the staff made me feel welcome and taken care of. The room was cozy, comfortable, and had all the little details that make a short stay feel special. T...

he property itself is beautiful and has that relaxing Napa Valley charm, perfect for winding down after a day of exploring. Even though it was a quick visit, I really enjoyed the atmosphere, and I wish I had stayed longer to experience more of what the hotel has to offer. I’d definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a comfortable and friendly place to stay in Napa!

I stayed here during a weekend family visit to Napa and found the hotel to offer good value. It meets the reliable Marriott standard, with a comfortable stay and helpful amenities. The heated pool was a nice feature, and the onsite EV charger a...

You stay at Marriott’s all over the United States and there’s just been something about quality control lately. Cleanliness is the number one factor for us. And we had mold all in the ceilings of our bathroom and on the floor. No one wants to s...

hower in a dirty looking tub with mold. Also, the condition of the mattress was appalling. You can see the stains in the photo. This Marriott, like several has an appealing lobby, but several things in the rooms are not being attended to carefully besides being dated . The size of our room and beds were small, with an awkward table and TV off to the side at a strange angle. There is a small drink fridge and a couple of bags of tea, but no lotion or any other toiletries- but honestly we can put up with these things. It’s the uncleanliness and the lack of attention to the maintenance that makes this a real concern.

The hotel is in an industrial type area. Nothing within walking distance. The rooms air conditioning units (inside room) is very noisy. Hard to sleep. Sounds like a jet taking off and ran all night. We rented several rooms. One of the rooms sh...

ower was awful - no pressure. When we checked out told lady at front desk and she just stared at us. Did not ask which room or write down info. So it’s obvious it won’t be fixed. Buffet breakfast was ok. Was hoping for sliced fruit. Service not so much. Ran out of coffee both days we were there. Ran out of food both days. Went and told front desk and lady (there were no food employees visible to tell) working and she was extremely rude saying they have food people working on it. It was like i bothered her. It’s not what you say is how you say it and say it with a smile. Both days we waited for coffee and food to be refilled. One day waited 45 minutes for the mini croissant sandwiches to be refilled. The trash can for food area is too small. Both days trash can overflowing and people then leaving plates on tables. Seems like the food people are not organized. We watched the good guy stand around chatting with people when food containers were empty. The pool area is neglected. Both days we sat at pool and had to pick up peoples towels left on chairs. There was no employee observed coming in to pick up towels, garbage etc. will not stay at this property again.
