simply “take pictures” he bottled up the exact feeling of our day and handed it back to us in images so rich we swear they have a heartbeat. From our engagement shoot where he turned a random city street into a movie scene to our wedding day where he floated through the crowd like some kind of friendly photography ninja Alex caught moments we didn’t even realize happened. A quiet look. A laugh from across the room. That perfect wind-in-the-hair shot we didn’t even know we wanted. Every photo feels alive. They’re not stiff or staged they’re honest and cinematic at the same time. Friends and family keep asking who our photographer was because the pictures don’t just look beautiful they feel like us. If you want more than standard wedding photos if you want memories that feel like your favorite film you call Alex. Just be prepared he might spoil you for every other photographer out there.

ame out beautifully, natural, emotional, and full of life. It only made sense to continue with their full wedding photography and videography package, which was one of the best decisions we made for our big day. Alex and his team captured everything with so much care and professionalism, never intrusive and always making us feel comfortable. One of the things we especially appreciated was the option to include a privacy clause in our contract. My husband’s line of work requires a higher level of discretion, and Alex was incredibly understanding. He provided that extra layer of privacy at a very reasonable cost, and it gave us real peace of mind. Every time we look through our photos and videos, we’re brought right back to those unforgettable moments. Highly recommended!

On the wedding day, we really appreciated how well Alex blended into the background while still capturing all the important moments. During formal family photos, he was incredibly sharp and efficient. He managed both of our families with ease. I also spoke with our venue coordinator afterward, and she mentioned how much she enjoys working with Alex. She has known him for years and has nothing but good things to say. Our photos came out beautifully. They feel natural, emotional, and full of the energy of the day. We’re so happy we went with Creative Cinema Photography.

I honestly can’t say enough good things about Creative Cinema Photography and working with Alex and his second photographer, Stacy. They were an incredible team. What really stood ...

out to me was the intention behind every single photo. At my sister’s wedding, her photographer gave her over 3,000 images, but most of them felt generic. Just basic wedding photos with no real soul. It was overwhelming and hard to even find the moments that truly mattered. With Alex and Stacy, we received around 800 photos, and every single one felt meaningful. Nothing was filler. The way they captured emotions, reactions, and the little details that made our day special was exactly what I hoped for. This is how wedding photography should be. Thoughtful, beautiful, and full of heart. I’m beyond happy with the results and would recommend Creative Cinema Photography to anyone who wants their memories told with purpose.

age with Creative Cinema Photography, and it was a smart move. From the very beginning, everything felt easy and natural. Even now, a month later, my mom still brings up how good you were and how comfortable you made everyone feel. She’s told half her friends that it felt like you were part of the family. The photos are beautiful and feel so thoughtfully crafted. Every moment, big and small, was captured with such care. And the video? It made us both cry and has been getting nonstop compliments from our coworkers and friends. If you're looking for someone who really cares and delivers incredible memories, this is the right company. We’re so grateful. Raphaela & Jose

e, I’d probably just call it “pretty good at not being awkward.” From the moment I met Teresa, I knew we had a special bond. She gave me that “don’t mess this up, Alex” look, and I took that as my mission. I’m so glad everyone felt comfortable and that the photos and video brought real emotion. Knowing it meant so much to you is everything. Thanks for letting me be part of it. It truly felt like family 🙏

y. During our engagement shoot, Alex somehow managed to make two very camera-shy people feel totally at ease, and we ended up with photos we absolutely loved. Honestly, the fact that Alex wasn't available for our wedding day just proves how incredible his entire team is. Larry and Nicholas were fantastic. They captured the day so beautifully and naturally. We were so happy to see that the quality and style were just as perfect as our first session. Getting the photos back so quickly was such a treat, and the video just blew us away. It brought back all the emotions of the day and let us see moments we had missed. We couldn’t be happier and would recommend them to anyone looking for a stress-free experience and truly beautiful memories.

ons. Since a foreign wedding is complicated as is, Alex and his crew listened to our requests and arrived to all events prior to starting to capture every moment. Aside from that, he was really easy to work with and incorporated all of of our ideas and more into his photos and videos. I am glad that we had him capture this once in a lifetime event and deliver photos and videos in a timely manner(especially for a 5 day event!). Thanks a lot Alex and crew! We look forward to working with you for future events!

Highly recommend to anyone looking for timeless, magazine worthy images.

idn't even expect it, but he had drone footage and multiple cameras setup so our final video of the ceremony captured every angle and expression! His professionalism is top notch and even with working with our separate Photographer he was so kind to give them a tour of our venue since he had been there before. His energy with working with other vendors and our guests brought out the best of our night. We are so lucky to have use Creative Cinema and wouldn't change anything, we both highly recommend them to anyone and hope others can experience the pleasure of having your special day captured forever by someone as talented as Alex.

Alex is very responsive, easy to communicate with, very flexible- he was willing to meet with us also before the event itself, arrived on time with another videographer from his team, had a drone to capture some images of the place, and was very patient with us. I would be happy to work with him again and of course I highly recommend Alex to any couple who are looking for a wedding videographer. Really don’t think twice.

Alex is absolutely fabulous and hiring him for our wedding was the best decision we've ever made. At first we thought about skipping videography for our wedding since most companie...

s were charging a fortune. A few months before our wedding we reconsidered when we found Alex. He was kind, professional, helpful, and flexible. The day of our wedding he went above and beyond to capture every single special moment throughout the day. Before even seeing the final result we knew it would be amazing after seeing a few clips on his camera. The day he sent us our final videos we were completely fascinated. He even got some amazing aerial shots of our venue! The highlight film looks like something straight out of a music video and the full length film walks us through the best day of our lives without missing a second. After the wedding he was so helpful troubleshooting even the smallest things such as helping me with computer issues to be able to download the films! Alex, we are so blessed to have found you and that you were able to be a part of our big day!

We were recommended by a family friend to inquire on Alex's services as she was happy with her wedding videos. We were already married civilly in 2017, and were planning our church...

ceremony for the first weekend in November 2018. We had high expectations for our wedding video, and wanted the best of the best. The words to describe Alex and Miguel are endless, in a positive way! We had our wedding ceremony less than two weeks ago, and we already received both our highlights and full videos, which we are in love with. Both Alex and Miguel were professional yet properly casual. While trying to keep us on schedule, they allowed for the entire day to happen as is. They captured every moment we had hoped for, and exceeded our expectations. Price was also extremely reasonable, especially for two videographers to follow us around all day. Thank you both for making our videography dreams a reality, you guys are the best!!!! Roni.
