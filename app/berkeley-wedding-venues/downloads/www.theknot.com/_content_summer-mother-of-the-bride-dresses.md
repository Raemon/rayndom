## How to Choose Mother-of-the-Bride Summer Outfits

In addition to being up-to-date on all the latest [mother-of-the-bride dress trends](https://www.theknot.com/content/mother-of-the-bride-dress-trends), there are a few other key things you'll want to keep in mind before choosing your outfit. Follow the tips below and you'll be ready to start browsing summer dresses for the mother of the bride like a pro.

FEATURED VIDEO FROM THE KNOT

### Summer MOB Dress Colors

If you're wondering [what color the mother of the bride should wear](https://www.theknot.com/content/mother-of-the-bride-attire) at a summer wedding, the good news is that there are plenty of options. Summer is synonymous with bright, vibrant colors, like yellow, orange, fuschia and turquoise. Since these shades absorb less sun than darker ones, wearing one of them can actually help keep you cool at an outdoor event. Prints are fair game too, so consider choosing a dress that combines a handful of seasonal shades.

### Summer MOB Dress Fabrics

The fabric of your summer mother-of-the-bride dress may vary depending on whether you're attending a casual [outdoor wedding](https://www.theknot.com/content/what-to-wear-outdoor-wedding) or an indoor black-tie event. Cotton and linen dresses are considered more informal, so they work best for casual and semi-formal weddings in the summer. Chiffon, organza and satin are just as breathable, but a tad more elevated, making them great for cocktail, formal and black-tie events. No matter the dress code, be sure to choose a dress with a flowy silhouette that allows for maximum breathability in the heat.

### Summer MOB Accessories 

Seasonal [mother-of-the-bride accessories](https://www.theknot.com/content/mother-of-the-bride-accessories) can help give your outfit a more summery feel. When it comes to [jewelry for mother of the bride](https://www.theknot.com/content/mother-of-the-bride-jewelry), opt for pieces with ocean-inspired elements, like turquoise and pearls. For your handbag and [MOB shoes](https://www.theknot.com/content/mother-of-the-bride-shoes), we love anything made from natural materials like raffia and bamboo. If you're attending an outdoor wedding, be sure that your [wedding guest shoes](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-guest-shoes) can handle the terrain—whether it be grass, sand or gravel.
