nd his wife, Natasha, were there every step of the way. Phil kept us on track (we tend to wander) and kept the party rolling. We highly recommend Pure Energy and Phil! Thanks for an amazing time.

These two are a great team and wonderful to work with. The songs I did give them were mixed with other songs beautifully and totally my style. I would highly recommend them.

Phil and Natasha were so organized and great to work with! The music and photo booth were both wonderful as well!

Phil Trau was an outstanding DJ at our wedding. We very very picky and prescriptive- had a definite vision for the music and needs at our wedding. It probably also doesn't help tha...

t I work in events, so have a bunch of experience working with great production vendors. Phil met and exceeded pretty much every one of my expectations. Phil's website is on point- so easy to find and enter all of the songs you want him to play at your event, and rank them according to how much you want to hear them. The site is awesome. So well designed and helpful! You can keep coming back and adding to it as new requests or ideas come through, and he keeps everything organized and recorded so you never have to worry on the day of. Phil is easy to work with, not intent on being too much of a presence if you don't want him to be. He kept the dance party going at our wedding, and didn't waste time with announcements or fillers- which was really important to us. He was very professional and- perhaps most importantly to me- he wasn't needy about details. We had two calls leading up to the wedding day and that, along with the schedule we worked out, was all he needed to ensure everyting went absolutely smoothly on the day of. Awesome work Phil! Thanks so much for being the perfect DJ on our wedding day! I'd highly recommend the services of Pure Energy Productions!

Pure Energy did a great job with the music at our wedding. For the most part, we let the DJ choose the songs based on some guidelines that my husband and I gave. Kenny did a great ...

job. He was professional and really picked songs that set a fun atmosphere for the whole wedding. We were even told by the venue staff that they had never seen so many people dancing at a wedding!

des the obvious stuff) this was to read the crowd. I gave hima list of songs for sure i wasnted him to play and other than that hewas on his own, which meant he was paying attention to what the crowd liked and to run with that. He did this perfectly and i have never seen more people dance at a wedding in my life!! Definatly a great choice for a wedding and on top of everything they are very professional!!

My husband and I cannot rave enough about Pure Energy Productions. We just had our wedding two weeks ago and they were amazing. We hired them for the ceremony music, dinner music, ...

dancing, and photo booth. It is a family owned company and they are great. Our DJ-Phil- did everything and more that we asked of and kept the energy level right where it needed to be. At the end of the night he dropped in two cds of our ceremony and dinner music into our card cage. What a great/unique gift that was! Also- AMAZING photo booth. Top of the line, HD, great fun! And at the end of the night you get ALL of the photos on a cd. I would hire them again in a minute!
