We think Poppy Ridge is a fantastic venue if you’re looking for a flexible space or planning a DIY/local wedding :) we especially loved that there were lots of opportunities to customize the options, they had a lot of wedding pieces included (cutlery, linens, etc) already, and we were able to come in the day before to drop off items for set up.

We recently celebrated our wedding at Poppy Ridge and had the pleasure of working with Tiffani. She was incredibly helpful and responsive to our emails, making the entire planning ...

process so much smoother. She was attentive and available to help on the day of the event, making sure we had a chance to eat all the food that we planned for (appetizers, buffet dinner and cake)! Many of our guests raved about both the food and the stunning views. Additionally, the venue has undergone recent renovations, and the updates added a modern touch to the space. One area that could be improved is adding more lighting in the parking lot as it was quite dark outside. Another downside to our experience was that the event staff began breaking down tables earlier than expected — around 9 PM, even though our booking was until 11 PM. This seemed to be in preparation for another event the following day, but it did take away from our guests’ experience at the end of the night. Guests also later informed us that the staff had thrown away their wedding favors on the tables prior to the event ending time.

their response time when I emailed them with questions, and they were very accommodating when scheduling our food tasting & walk through. One thing I liked most about Poppy Ridge is being able to work with any vendor I wanted, they didn’t make me choose from a list. On the day of the wedding, their team was very helpful through the whole day. Their venue coordinator was very attentive and made sure everything on their end was running seamless. She did a much better job than the wedding coordinator I hired, so shoutout to Erin! My guests were very happy with their hospitality, especially the bartenders! If I had the chance to do it over again, I would still choose them 100%! Thank you Poppy Ridge team for making my wedding day so special!

We planned to get married at Poppy Ridge May 2020 but due to Covid, had to reschedule to August 2020, then May 2021, before ultimately cancelling. Poppy Ridge was the second venu...

e we toured and we probably should have stopped looking that day. Every venue we saw after, we kept comparing to Poppy Ridge. Between the beautiful property, the catering price, everything that was included, plus how friendly and accommodating the staff was; no one could beat it. Abby was always quick to respond to all our questions. We did our menu tasting in Jan 2020 so even though we ended up not having our wedding there, I can attest that the food is amazing. I’ve heard horror stories of venues pressuring couples to get married on their original date or charging them hundreds of dollars to reschedule or limiting their options to mid-week weddings. I am happy to say that Abby and Poppy Ridge did none of that. Abby encouraged us to do what was best for us, whether that was rescheduling another year or cancelling. I know that Abby, Leanne and team would have executed an amazing wedding. If we ever decide to have a vow renewal or reception, Poppy Ridge will be at the top of our list.

the difficult decision to cancel our event, Abby and the rest of the Poppy Ridge staff were absolutely amazing. They were so kind and understanding, and quick to respond, throughout the whole process and brought great ease of mind. The ceremony and cocktail hour space outside had a beautiful view of the hills of Livermore, the indoor reception venue spacious and beautiful, and the food at our tasting was delicious. I'm so sad to not be able to celebrate here... but I highly recommend Poppy Ridge for any celebration!

When we decided to postpone our wedding, we were so lucky with how easy they made everything. We absolutely cannot wait to work with the team again to make our dream wedding come true!

I forget how I found Poppy Ridge, but I'm so glad I did. It wasn't even a question after touring and meeting with Abby if we were going to book or not. We booked shortly after and ...

it was the BEST decision ever. I know, I know there is not much information, social media etc about Poppy Ridge for Weddings, but let me say this, I don't think I could've chosen a better venue with the best Coordinators ever! The venue is gorgeous, super relaxed with anything and everything, and very accommodating. Inside and Outside were amazing, the ceremony was a great patio with gorgeous views, and very large. We had our wedding on September 1st, and because of that, they had the patio lights strung across the patio area which we also used for the dance floor, photo booth and ice cream serving. There was plenty of room for the DJ, and of course they had the side patio for cocktail hour which was more than enough room for everyone including cornhole. The inside might seem like it's not big enough, but it fit 13 tables, a head table, cake table and the buffet tables very comfortably. The hardwood floors were gorgeous and if you add some uplighting with your light package, it totally outdoes it. Abby was our main contact throughout the entire process. She was very responsive and thorough with every email I sent and every question I had. I don't think I could've calmed my nerves without her being so attentive with my wedding. She was so sweet and lovely and so great to work with. When we had our menu tasting we were introduced to Leanne. And Leanne would be our contact from there on out, but Abby would still respond if needed. Leanne was amazing throughout and day of! She handled everything with care and knew exactly what she was doing. I don't think I would've gotten through my wedding day without her there. She was on top of everything, and had every answer to every question. The end of the night was great, everything went smoothly and I can say for sure, it went by super quick. But Leanne was there until the end. My wedding planner and Leanne cleaned up, put my stuff in my vehicle and made sure everyone got on the shuttle or in their cars at the end of the night. Thank you Abby and Leanne and Poppy Ridge!! I can't wait to share the photos with you. Sara

Abby was our main point of contact for all most items leading up to our wedding, but Leanne was our go to for the BIG day. Both were amazing to work with, always on top of things and worked very well with our wedding planner who was looped in just a few weeks before we married. Our wedding was a dream come true, and we can't thank Poppy Ridge and all the staff who helped =) HIGHLY RECOMMEND. We're eternally grateful for all the details and help that make our wedding the best day ever!!

ould definitely see why this is her job because of her personality and how easily approachable she is. If you have any questions or concerns, she responds in a timely manner. Leanne was awesome as well. She did a good job doing the rehearsal and answered any questions. Side note & tips to help your coordinators and yourself: -Ask for the floor plan so it helps when making your seating chart. -Start your itinerary early. -Scope out the venue and take photos and videos to help you plan your vision and layout. -Assign people from your wedding party/fam or friends to help with the setting up/decorating if you’re using your own stuff and for people to help take the decorations. -Assign people to put gifts in the car so you don’t have to worry about it. Overall, Poppy Ridge was awesome and we had such a great wedding because of Abby/Leanne and the staff. Also, food was good and our guests commented on it.

mazed by the gorgeous view. Staff took care of set up and tear down of tables and chairs, as well as serving food and cake. Details for timeline, seating chart, ceremony procession, etc. were all discussed ahead of time. The day of coordinator was there to coordinate wedding party members, vendors, and staff. She was also there the day before for the wedding rehearsal, which made things run smoothly. I do recommend hiring someone to take care of the extra details such as setting up the aisle runner, any projectors, screens, guest book, favors, table numbers, etc. as they are not in charge of setting those up. I also recommend hiring a good DJ that will follow the timeline and make announcements when needed, as well as check in with the coordinator throughout the day. Since this venue is also a restaurant, there will be a limit to how early vendors will be able to set up. Any changes in terms of schedule can be discussed and the venue tried their best to adjust to our needs. The food was amazing and guests had more than enough to eat. Overall, we recommend this venue if you want a great wedding experience with an amazing view.

re very responsive, answered all our questions and spent the time to give us plenty of details \- the site is beautiful \- prices were within our budget \- they (already) had excellent reviews on The Knot. Abby and Leanne have been incredibly helpful both for planning and during the wedding day. They were always very fast to respond and have a handy website/portal to follow up with emails, documents, payments etc. The tasting session was great, we went over all the decoration details, many food choices (it was hard to pick), the chef (chef Ray) was very helpful too and brought suggestions and personalized changes. The place was ideal for \- the ceremony: outside, nice background, enough space, and some decoration items were provided (arch, wine barrels, easel for welcome sign...) \- cocktail hour: people could chill outside while enjoying the view \- reception: the room inside was big enough, we really liked the layout of bar / dance floor / building and it could be decorated easily (mostly flowers and light for us) \- pictures along the golf course: we got really cool wedding pics with natural and romantic backgrounds :) We did not have a wedding planner and it was not an issue during the wedding event, Leanne helped us a lot from welcoming the vendors to following the time line for photo tour, food etc... Many of our guests gave us very good feedback on the food and location. My wife and I were very pleased to have our wedding there, staff is amazing and we highly recommend the place. Venue booked on: April 18 2018 Wedding date: April 27 2019 Number of guests: 122

Every question, new request, change of mind and concerns were handled and answered quickly and with such service. They made me feel that good friends were taking care of everything and that I wouldn't have a worry the day of. The day of was amazing! Just as we discussed during our rehearsal and dozen emails, the balcony (aka ceremony and dance floor) was under beautiful lights, the staff were all polite, charismatic, invisible yet accommodating. My guests all commented that the food was delicious, service impeccable, venue was stunning and the night perfect! We are anxiously waiting for our pictures and be welcomed back from our honeymoon. Would recommend everything about this venue and staff! Abby and Leanne, you ladies are truly the best!
