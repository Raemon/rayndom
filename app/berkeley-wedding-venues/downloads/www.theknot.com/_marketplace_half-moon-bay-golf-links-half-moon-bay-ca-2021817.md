**To preface, I did not plan a wedding, but a corporate event at HMB Golf Links. However, I feel like I should share my experience in hopes to save any brides some heartache and he...

adaches. My company was hosting an event at the Ritz Carlton next door to HMB Golf Links. While I know they are not affiliated with the Ritz in any way, considering the close proximity and their regular interaction with their guests, I did expect a similar level of professionalism. I reached out in July to HMB Golf Links to begin planning a dinner that would take place at the end of September. I was ghosted several times by the event manager, and given the run around by staff when I would call trying to speak with her. If it had not been for the close proximity to the Ritz and the sparse other options in HMB, I would have never continued to try and make this dinner work. In the end, our dinner was completely unorganized, our meal selections weren't ordered in time by the chef and our only options were to piece meal items together from a to-go menu the day before, and yet, our bill was still almost $5,000 for 12 people. I would highly recommend anyone planning any kind of event, whether it's a corporate dinner, social outing, or wedding, to look elsewhere for a venue and save yourself a headache.

venue as this was the most important thing for us. The food was delicious and the wait staff was great. Unfortunately for us there were some changes in management and the person we originally did a tasting with and went over all the little details with had left. We had to start over and explain everything to someone else and make sure they were following through with our wedding requests. At times we were frustrated because we were managing this new person. We were fearful things would fall through the cracks. There ended up being an event before ours and my other vendors had to sit around and wait to set up. The venue knew what time my vendors were coming but never did they mention it would be best for them to come later. All in all our wedding was great but dealing with this venue did add stress to the already stressful planning of a wedding. Hopefully they will iron out the kinks and make future couples feel better down the line. The day of coordinator that was provided to us free of charge was AMAZING and really helped us through taking pictures and getting the day to run smoothly.

We selected the HMB Golf Links because of the beautiful location right off the bat. Truly amazing, I could see our perfect wedding day from the start. We met with several differe...

nt people during our initial decision making processes and loved everyone there. After booking our wedding the process was easy. Our tasting was amazing - the sauces the chef creates are fantastic! It was very important to both of us to have delicious food and drink. After the tasting our great interactions with the golf course came to an unfortunate end. During our wedding process one of the coordinators left, which one very upsetting to me as she was definitely my favorite person there! Our interactions with the golf course for the last two months of the planning process were very difficult. Response times for emails and phone calls were extremely lengthy and communication became more and more frustrating. Our interactions were saved during the final two weeks of the planning process after a very serious discussion. The wedding day turned out perfectly! The food was so incredible! The staff were all so helpful and made the day the best way to start our married life. Our pictures are amazing - seriously they have the most amazing views and fabulous photo opportunities before and after the ceremony. I'm also partial to the 10th tee location - it's so beautiful with the big cypress, the pond, the bridge, and the background of the ocean and the Ritz in the distance.
