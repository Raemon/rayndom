When it comes to [choosing the kind of wedding you want](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-style-finder), color plays a huge role in impacting the [wedding vibe](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-vibes-meaning). Thankfully, the Pantone Color of the Year is a great way to stay on top of [wedding color trends](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-color-palettes-we-love). So, what is the Pantone Color of the Year? The Pantone Color Institute, which gets its name from the combination of "Pan" (for all) and "Tone" (for color), established this color trend forecasting initiative at the turn of the millennium. The history of the Pantone Color of the Year dates back to 2000 when The Pantone Color Institute dubbed Cerulean the inaugural color of the year (aka COTY).

That's great and all, but what do these color forecasts have to do with weddings? Pantone brings standardization to the world of color through their established Pantone Matching System (PMS). After all, it isn't just gray that comes in 50 shades. When you're telling a wedding florist you want blue, there's a chance they'll pull out a Pantone Color Guide, made up of PMS color chips, so everyone is on the same page and can align on a specific color. Beyond communicating your [wedding colors](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-color-inspiration-boards) with vendors, you can even use Pantone's colors to better articulate to bridesmaids what shade of blush you want them to wear or to settle on the perfect ivory bath towels for your wedding registry. In short, Pantone colors, and the Pantone Color of the Year, are a great resource to aid in [picking your wedding color palette](https://www.theknot.com/content/weddings-with-color) as part of the [wedding planning journey](https://www.theknot.com/content/12-month-wedding-planning-countdown). Take a look at the complete list of every Pantone Color of the Year since 2000.

_Pantone Color Institute_

It's here! The 2026 color of the year is Cloud Dancer 11-4201, described as "a billowy, balanced white imbued with a feeling of serenity" by the Pantone Color Institute. The hue is appropriately a version of bridal white, evoking the calming ambiance of a cloud-filled sky or the beauty of a silky white wedding dress. Since the color is neutral, it can easily be coupled with a range of well-balanced hues, especially pastel colors. This includes Raindrops on Roses (a muted pink), Ice Melt (a powdery blue), as well as Lemon Icing (a subdued yellow), to name a few options. Pantone describes Cloud Dancer as "a lofty white that serves as a symbol of calming influence in a society rediscovering the value of quiet reflection."

For couples planning their weddings, the color should evoke a sense of calm as they prepare for the best party of their lives.

Couples can opt for monochromatic enhancements of Cloud Dancer throughout their wedding day too. This resilient wedding color pairs nicely with natural backdrops, especially. 

The color is equal parts ethereal and practical, serving as a solid option for wedding whites. It will be a purposeful and creative canvas for the wedding professionals dreaming up couples' wedding aesthetics for 2026.

The 2025 Pantone Color of the Year was Mocha Mousse 17-1230.

When it comes to practical tips on how to include the 2025 Pantone Color of the Year in your wedding, Deliece Knights-Barnett, founder and CEO of [Dhalia Events](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/dhalia-events-mahopac-ny-2025282), suggests using the color to enhance reception tablescapes. She notes that couples can include Mocha Mousse in "their table setting design with lightly tinted glassware or goblets in Mocha Mousse. Adding a runner or napkin in the color of the year is an easy alternative." Knights-Barnett also encourages couples to lean into texture since the mousse inspiration from Pantone lends itself to multidimensional color interpretations. "Couples can get creative and play with the textures of these items. Use suede or velvet on napkins or tablecloths (or even the handles of flatware) to add some visual and tactile dimension to the use of the color of the year."

The Pantone Color of the Year in 2000 was Cerulean, the first-ever Color of the Year from Pantone. A few years later, the color iconically stole the show in _The Devil Wears Prada_. Miranda Priestly's famous monologue about a cerulean sweater in the 2006 film _The Devil Wears Prada_ offers a comical, but valid, peek into the vast power of color trends and why systems like Pantone matter. Meryl Streep's character iconically says to her intern, played by Anne Hathaway, "You… go to your closet, and you select… I don't know, that lumpy blue sweater, for instance, because you're trying to tell the world that you take yourself too seriously to care about what you put on your back, but what you don't know is that **that sweater is not just blue, it's not turquoise, it's not lapis, it's actually cerulean.** You're also blithely unaware of the fact that, in 2002, Oscar de la Renta did a collection of cerulean gowns, and then I think it was Yves Saint Laurent, wasn't it?… who showed cerulean military jackets. I think we need a jacket here. And then cerulean quickly showed up in the collections of eight different designers. Then it filtered down through the department stores and then trickled on down into some tragic casual corner where you, no doubt, fished it out of some clearance bin. However, that blue represents millions of dollars of countless jobs, and it's sort of comical how you think that you've made a choice that exempts you from the fashion industry when, in fact, you're wearing a sweater that was selected for you by the people in this room… from a pile of 'stuff.'" Mic' drop.
