We loved working with House of Pheras and their team! They were always responsive to our questions and incredibly approachable. They helped us save money by guiding us to make the ...

right choices, and thoughtfully curated our events to keep them beautiful without unnecessary spending. They also took great care of all our guests, which was especially important to us for a destination wedding. We’re so happy with their work and overall approach.

We honestly don’t even know where to begin. Planning a wedding is… a lot. And we went into it thinking we could maybe juggle it all on our own, but somewhere along the way—after a ...

million Pinterest boards and venue emails—we realized we needed help. Not just a planner, but someone who gets it. From the first call, Megha felt like someone we could trust with something this personal. She asked the right questions, paid attention to the little things we didn’t even think to mention, and kept the whole process (somehow?) calm and on track. What stood out the most was how she handled our families—two very different cultures, two sets of parents with very strong opinions, and a ton of moving parts. Somehow, she made everyone feel heard, included, and at ease. And for us? She gave us space to enjoy the process without losing our minds. On the day of the wedding, we just showed up—and it felt like stepping into a dream we didn’t even know we could have. People still tell us it was one of the most beautiful weddings they’ve ever been to. And we believe it—because it felt that way to us, too. House of Pheras and entire team, thank you for helping us hold onto the joy and let go of the stress. We’ll never forget it
