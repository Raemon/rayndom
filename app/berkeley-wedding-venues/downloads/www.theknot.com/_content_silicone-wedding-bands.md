FEATURED VIDEO FROM THE KNOT

## What Are Silicone Wedding Bands?

Silicone wedding bands are non-metal rings made synthetically of silicone. They have a rubber-like texture and are flexible. Siegal and Widrick share that silicone wedding bands are durable rings generally made from medical-grade silicone. The experts go on to explain that silicone wedding rings are designed to be a safe and comfortable alternative to traditional metal wedding bands. "They're especially popular among people with active lifestyles—of course athletes but not limited to them," says Siegel. "If you're cooking a lot, gardening, or doing a daily fitness routine (hello, everyday athletes!) at the gym they reduce the risk of injury and won't get damaged or scratched like metal rings can."

## What Is the Purpose of Silicone Wedding Bands?

Silicone wedding bands are "designed to be a safe, comfortable alternative to traditional metal rings—especially for people with active lifestyles, hands-on jobs, or skin sensitivities," Ray Aupiu explains. "Whether you're working out, swimming, traveling, or on the job, silicone rings offer a lightweight, low-maintenance way to symbolize your commitment without sacrificing comfort or safety." 

Silicone wedding bands are the "perfect solution for couples who want durability without sacrificing the significance of wearing their ring every day," adds Ray Aupiu, "From work to play, silicone rings offer a durable, and fashionable way to show your commitment."

### For Travel

Many couples opt for silicone wedding rings when traveling so that they can enjoy their trip without worrying about a lost wedding ring. Rather than [choosing not to wear your wedding ring](https://www.theknot.com/content/choose-not-to-wear-wedding-band) on a trip, silicone wedding rings allow you to show your commitment in a worry-free way. Having an [inexpensive wedding ring](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-to-save-money-on-wedding-ring), like a silicone ring, to wear during your trip ensures you can be fully present and enjoy your [romantic getaway](https://www.theknot.com/content/best-romantic-getaways-us) or [honeymoon travel](https://www.theknot.com/content/a-honeymoon-planning-timeline) without any distractions. 

### For Work

For those who work with their hands often, a silicone wedding ring may be a great option for you. Silicone rings are designed to break away if they get snagged on something, so they reduce the risk of injury, especially in a hands-on workplace. It's also a great option to avoid any [ring damage](https://www.theknot.com/content/engagement-ring-hazards-damage) on your traditional wedding band that could occur in the workplace. 

### For Safety

Silicone wedding bands are a much safer option for everyday wear than a traditional metal ring. Rather than forego a ring altogether, silicone rings allow you to wear a wedding band no matter what you are doing or working on. Siegel and Widrick emphasize that safety is a key reason for wearing silicone wedding bands. Siegel explains that the purpose of wearing "a safe, comfortable way to symbolize your love and commitment—even during activities where a traditional metal ring could be damaged or cause injury."

### For Comfort

While it's tradition to wear your wedding ring everyday, the truth is that traditional rings can be uncomfortable during certain activities. "Whether you're at the gym, outdoors, or working with your hands, a silicone band lets you keep that meaningful reminder of your partner with you at all times, without worrying about scratches, snags, or discomfort," Widrick explains. 

## How to Choose the Best Silicone Wedding Bands for You

Before you start ring shopping just yet, there are a few key factors you'll want to consider when [choosing a wedding ring](https://www.theknot.com/content/rules-for-choosing-your-wedding-bands) made of silicone. From comfort to style, make sure you check all of your boxes before selecting the best silicone ring for you.

### Choose the Correct Size

Selecting a high-quality silicone ring that fits well is essential for ensuring optimal comfort and longevity, and understanding [how a ring should fit](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-should-a-ring-fit) is crucial in selecting the right ring for you. The last thing anyone wants is a too loose ring slipping off and getting lost. When in doubt, try on a few sizes to see which feels the best on you. 

Siegel and Widrick explain that your silicone ring "should fit snugly without feeling tight. If you're between sizes or prefer a looser fit, it's usually best to size up. QALO also offers a handy [sizing guide](https://qalo.com/pages/ring-size-chart?srsltid=AfmBOool2dLrbyrEwjDqIIrxcbhxV2lZWN65XQPtJmwOAird8OK8xVjv) and even a [printable ring sizer](https://qalo.com/products/qalo-ring-sizer?srsltid=AfmBOopvliIWmDjNyLwXaQS-pXca4iKmpz8UulcQIg9qhsXioKObU1LK) to help you find the perfect fit.

"Most silicone rings are designed with a snug, secure fit," Ray Aupiu tells us. "If you're in between sizes, we recommend sizing up." Enso also offers a [size guide](https://ensorings.com/pages/silicone-ring-sizer?srsltid=AfmBOooEwl6p7tWUaIp7TlCXQYGW50jJ0iFdxKpiJepP_JXoBi8j15SS) on their website that can help you determine the best size for you.

### Determine Your Purpose

While many couples opt for silicone wedding rings as an additional ring they can wear as needed, some may prefer a silicone ring as their everyday ring and forgo a traditional wedding band altogether. The choice is an entirely personal one and will vary, so there's no "right" way to wear your silicone ring.

"Many people wear a traditional metal ring for the ceremony and keep a [silicone wedding band] handy for everyday wear (and the honeymoon!)," Ray Aupiu explains. The pro notes that some folks like the modern, minimalist look and use their silicone ring as their primary wedding band. "There's no rulebook—just do what fits your lifestyle and love story best," they emphasize. 

### Opt for Comfort Features If Needed

While silicone rings are innately comfortable, some rings on the market have additional features, like grooves, to add even more comfort and flexibility. "If you're always on the move or work with your hands, opt for a ring with added durability or breathable grooves," Ray Aupiu advises. 

### Have Fun

Because they are much less expensive than traditional metal wedding rings, you can have fun trying out different colors and styles of your silicone ring without necessarily needing to commit to just one. "Silicone bands are usually budget-friendly, so you can collect a few and switch them up depending on your mood, outfit, or occasion," Ray Aupiu suggests.

Rather than having one traditional wedding ring, silicone wedding rings allow you to swap out different colors and styles for different occasions. "Choosing a wedding band or an engagement ring is a huge commitment- and a big decision. Silicone bands offer a lot of fun, flexibility," the QALO team tells us. "They can match your mood, outfit, activity, and they can be traded in and out."

Ray Aupiu echoes this sentiment. "Don't be afraid to let it reflect your personality and unique styles," she tells us.
