Neon Velvet will keep your wedding dancing all night long. The band went above and beyond for us. We loved their sizzle reel with their unique song choices, adding some flare to ...

a traditionally formal event, and their talent. My wife and I are both musicians, so this was a very important vendor for both of us. The Neon Velvet team learned 4 songs for us, including one that they allowed us to play with the band for to surprise all our guests and kick off the dancing. They were extremely easy to work with, made us comfortable on and off stage, and holy smokes did they execute day of. Their setlist was exactly what we were aspiring for, they brought energy throughout the entire evening, and the musicians sounded fantastic. I believe there were some backing tracks, so songs that have a traditional brass section or important instrument that isn't live didn't feel like they were missing anything, and all the guests got a pure live experience. I would highly suggest Neon Velvet for anyone's upcoming wedding, they had a very high bar for our event and they cleared it with ease.

We hired Neon for our wedding in July 2019. They exceeded our expectations. We had asked them to collaborate with our 2nd Line Brass Band on a few songs and they absolutely crushed...

it. They went above the call of duty to learn a first dance song we requested that was not on their set list. As far as catering to our needs for the wedding their service was unparalleled. Apart from wedding logistics their sound was totally amazing from GnR to Prince they did it all masterfully. The dance party was amazing as all the guests Bride & Groom rocked the dance floor through the very last note. Thanks again. For anyone shopping for a cover band for an event, party, or wedding we would go with Neon again in a heart beat.

We had seen the band play an event in the Bay Area and thought they were great. When we were planning our wedding we wanted people to stay and dance and really enjoy the evening wi...

th us. We reached out to Neon Velvet and were excited to find out that not only were they happy to play weddings and travel to Lake Tahoe, but they were really reasonable. They're the ultimate dance band but they didn't take over and turn our wedding into a concert, they really blended into and added to the night. They were super easy to work with, personable, professional, delivered beyond expectations! They dealt with limited "stage space" in a nice mountain lodge venue and really made it work. And with the energy the band brought and great sound people couldn't not dance.

Neon Velvet is by far one of the most professional outfits I’ve experienced in my musical adult life. They always give 100% sonically and are an extremely talented set of good look...

ing entertainers that have never missed on any level during any of the 50 + shows i’ve attended. The crowd is stomping the floor till 1:30-2am every show across all venues from private to business to club locations. I hired NV for my wifes 50th and was completely surprised at not only the huge catalog of song selects but kindness and care that they went through to provide a unique and personalized tailored set for us. If you haven’t been to one of their shows, you ain’t living.

Neon Velvet performed at my wedding reception in 2017. They went as far as to learn a special song that I requested for our first dance. I could not have asked for a better perform...

ance!!! They had everybody in tears with that song and the rest of the night they had EVERYBODY on the dance floor! Several friends of ours that saw Neon Velvet at our reception went on to request them for special events. Make no mistake, Neon Velvet is one of the best in the business and will help to make your wedding reception everything that you dreamed it would be!!!

I could not recommend Neon Velvet more! This band is incredible and definitely gets the crowd going! I used them at a wedding I did last year and loved them so much I booked them...

again for 2 more weddings on the spot! Plus, I had half my audience asking for their contact information so they could book them too!! In addition, not only is Neon Velvet extremely talented, but they also put on an incredible show and have a song list that appeals to all ages! They are definitely my favorite and go to band!

Neon Velvet and their amazing sound, brings back the awesome memories of the 80’s & 90’s music you loved with some new hits sprinkled in the mix. You will be up out of your seat ...

If you are searching for a band for a wedding, you can stop now because Neon Velvet is the best you're ever going to find. When we were searching, we came across Neon Velvet and...

discovered they were playing live near us. After two or three songs, we were going to be disappointed if we had anyone else play at our wedding knowing what we could have had. They were incredibly professional to work with, asked for and followed our input, and most important of all they were fun. I've gone to see them a few times since the wedding, and they are even better now. Highly recommend.
