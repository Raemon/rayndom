Had an absolutely lovely time! We were a group of 6 on 4/6/25 at 10:30am, and we did the brunch tasting. The patio we were seated on had gorgeous views. Our tasting was led by Victor, who was incredibly knowledgeable and a fantastic and very fu...

n host. The food was delicious and all of the service was great; one of our party members is gluten free and the kitchen kindly accommodated that for her portions of the family-style meal. Highly recommend!

A Sparkling Sonata in Sonoma Let me set the scene: It’s a June morning. Not just any morning. A crisp, sun-kissed, California morning, and the kind Texans write country songs about because we can only dream of being outside this time of year w...

ithout melting like a sno-cone in a sauna. We had 11:00 AM reservations for the Taste of Carneros experience at Gloria Ferrer, California’s most awarded sparkling winery and folks, the award shelf must be sagging under the weight of excellence. When we arrived, our table was already staged like a magazine spread: glasses twinkling, menus placed with precision, and views that could silence a room. My adoring sidekick: refined, radiant, and ever-so-prepared for bubbly, was already in her element. As I adjusted my chair to soak in the panoramic perfection of rolling vineyards and olive trees swaying like old souls, she was mid-sip, eyes closed, communing with the first pour. The sparkling wines? Ethereal. Each one whispered something different to the senses: crisp orchard fruit, warm brioche, a flirtatious hint of citrus, and all pulled from the estate like liquid gold. This wasn’t a tasting. It was a symphony, and we had front-row seats. We added Spanish tapas to the mix because, let’s be honest, bubbles demand a supporting cast. The Charcuterie Board: A rustic dream. Manchego, almonds, salami, dried fruit, crackers, and yes, the caper berries, plump as grapes and twice as sassy. The Marinated Olives: These weren’t the olives pressed for their estate olive oil, but a separate batch served up with bold, briny flair. While I maintain my lifelong diplomatic distance from olives, my sidekick declared them “sensational,” and I respect her palate as much as I respect her judgment in husbands. The Empanada: Flaky, golden, and filled with something that made my taste buds do a double-take. A savory masterpiece with a side of greens for moral support. Our wine guide, Ava, was the human equivalent of a great toast—elegant, warm, celebratory, and perfectly timed. Her knowledge flowed freely, her stories were engaging, and her hospitality sealed the deal. She elevated an already magical experience. The interior spaces? Picture a Restoration Hardware catalog crossed with a Sonoma dream—open, modern, and inviting. Even the vine sculpture on the wall seemed to lift its arms and say, “You belong here.” Outside, we explored more seating areas, including some modern Adirondack chairs that looked like they belonged on the cover of Architectural Digest: Vineyard Edition. And the views, dear Lord, the views. We stood together overlooking those vines, taking a photo not just to capture the moment but to testify: we were here, and it was glorious. As we wrapped up, my wife lingered with one last glass of her favorite pour, like a perfectly placed encore before the curtain closed on a flawless performance. We didn’t just enjoy the experience. We absorbed it. TL;DR: Gloria Ferrer is the Beyoncé of bubbles. Sparkling wine that sings, tapas that thrill, and views that steal your breath. Impeccable service, stunning surroundings, and a patio made for Texas escapees. Come for the wine. Stay for the soul-realignment. Already planning our return.

This was a fantastic experience! First off, the view is absolutely beautiful and the lounge area we were seated was comfortable, sunny, and had a great vibe. All of the wines we tasted were wonderful and i would love to have again. Kenny G was ...

the one helping us out and he was very knowledgeable, helpful, and overall a great host. His passion and love for the wines was evident. He gave us generous pours and even offered us more if our hearts desired. We ordered some tapas and it surprised me how high quality they were. I'm usually underwhelmed with the food at wineries but not here. We got the olives, pistachios, garlic mushrooms, patatas bravas, shrimp, duck leg confit, and the dessert platter. The olives were some of my favorite that i've had and the duck leg confit was so flavorful and cooked to perfection! The dessert platter was the perfect way to end the tasting and really went well with the wines. Our whole group agreed at the end of our trip that this was our favorite of the wineries we visited. I would definitely come back and highly recommend this experience!
