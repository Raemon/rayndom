Amy met with us to take engagement photos at the place where we got engaged. A few days prior to the photo shoot, we realized that it would likely rain and were worried about how t...

hings would work and that rescheduling would affect our wedding planning timeline. We were ready to risk the elements as was Amy who let us know that she was ready to do the photo shoot rain or shine. Everything worked out better than expected (the weather was on our side for the most part) and we were blown away with how amazing the photos turned out! Our families and friends have also commented on how much they love the photos. Amy also made the process very fun and educated us on some very useful tips for being photographed that we plan to use on our wedding day!

mmunicative and scouted out the perfect location - creating a detailed map and Facetiming with him so he could get a feel for the location and where all the family would be hiding, photographs taken, etc. Day of she was amazing and took the best pictures, capturing not only the proposal but all of the family together and then a photoshoot of just us two at Chrissy Field. Her photos are truly beautiful and capture our emotion and happiness perfectly. It then only took a few hours for a sneak peek of a few photos and 1.5 weeks to get the finished photos. My entire family and friends were all blown away and said our photos were the best engagement photos they've seen - not just because of the quality but because of the moments she was able to capture. From the first phone call to the debut of the photo album (which she encouraged to plan as a date night - highly recommend!) - we could not have asked for a better experience. thank you Amy!!

Amy was great to work with for our wedding in May. When I hired her I requested for the bare minimum posed photos and maximum candid pictures of our friends and family having fun. ...

I appreciated that she listened to that request! She was on time, friendly, and professional, and hustled to get the posed photos done quickly, which isn't easy considering she had to wrangle our big, easily distracted wedding party and our year old son. We loved all the moments she captured, which included lots of candid dance floor pictures, details of the decor that I hadn't even noticed on the day, and pictures of people from different parts of our lives talking and getting to know each other. She made a point to capture a portrait of all the guests and couples, which was really nice to be able to share with them. She was also super quick to get us an extensive sneak peek album, and the entire album followed soon after. She was quick to respond to any emails before and after the wedding, which not all wedding vendors are! I would recommend working with Amy.

Amy made me feel like she was more of a friend due to her relaxed nature and fun personality. She got silly with us and laughed with us which made it a fun experience. Her eye for detail, perspective, and creativity made for the most beautiful photos. Everyone who has seen our engagement photos is blown away. I am forever thankful for the amazing work she did and the memories captured that we will have for a lifetime . xoxo Juliana and Daniel

From start to finish she was kind, helpful, and was so easy to communicate with. The quality of her photos is unmatched and even if you are not the most comfortable in front of a camera she makes it feel like you are natural! Would highly recommend to anyone in search of a photographer! Thank you again Amy for all of your help and for the incredible experience.

When I was looking at photographer portfolios, what I paid attention to most was how they capture candids. Could the joy, love, and excitement of the days shine through? Literally ...

no one could compete with Amy Little there! She has an incredible talent for capturing the sweet moments that make a wedding special. Then I talked to her, and we instantly vibed. She even made my fiance lighten up and feel comfortable -- a herculean task! On top of that, she made us look and feel stunning. She taught us two awkward penguins how to model and let our true selves show on film. I still don't know how she did it! And on the day of, she not only was solving problems like a boss, she turned her creative eye into some jawdroppingly beautiful creative pictures in the rain. She's a genius, and I couldn't be happier with how the photos turned out.

She was very sweet and great to work with the entire time we took photos all around the vineyard for our proposal. Highly recommend!

ot, working much longer than she had to in the rain and extreme wind and fog to produce the most stunning photos. She hopped on calls with us to go over details and timelines before the wedding and gave us tips to make everything run smoothly. When my dress zipper busted, Amy spent more than two hours calling her mom (a former seamstress) and helping my husband and mom sew me into my dress so I could attend the reception. Since we lost out on valuable photo time, she stayed much longer than her contracted time to get us as many photos as possible. Her presence was seamless - she meshed with the party so well, and took photos like there were three of her. Everyone in the room was her best friend by the end of the night because of her ability to make everyone so comfortable and have a great time. We were blown away by her talent and her ability to direct us to make us look more natural (a difficult task). She sent us a sneak peak less than two days after the wedding that included hundreds of photos, which was an amazing addition to our minimoon. Amy, you made our wedding such a success, and we're so glad we found you!!!

she was there - but she was able to capture the most memorable photos that we will cherish forever. We are totally not photo people, but during our entire session she was so encouraging and made us feel so comfortable. We walked outta there feeling like a million bucks! The photos are unbelievable. She blew us out of the water, she captured everything from the view to our special laughing moments and we couldn't recommend her enough.

This is an embarrassingly long overdue review from our October 2021 wedding at the Berkeley City Club. Where to even begin with how amazing Amy was and how much we loved working w...

ith her and our final photos…. A bit of backstory… like so many, we were supposed to get married on 10/10/2020, but Covid forced us to postpone an entire year, which made things a bit complicated for our vendors and us. Our original photographer ended up pregnant shortly after we postponed with a due date roughly a month before the new wedding date, so we were in a bit of a scramble to find someone to take her place. Miraculously, the stars aligned, and Amy was actually free on our date! She immediately got to work getting to know us and familiarizing herself with our vibe and our vision. To be frank, I was dealing with some mental health issues (who wasn’t at that time!), and she very gently and kindly dealt with my decision fatigue and untimely emails. Leading up to the event, she was professional, on top of everything, and answered my rambling frazzled emails with no snark and all kindness. On the big day, she was on time, brought an excellent second shooter, and captured every single thing I had wanted (and honestly, it’s more impressive when you realize that she basically read my mind because I was not a good communicator.) She dealt with my bonkers family and friends and showed no signs of annoyance when she was trying to herd my family for portraits. I do not fancy myself as very photogenic, but I was beyond happy with all of my bridal pics, and our bride and groom photos looked totally natural and not forced or staged (and we are not folks that take fall photos yearly in almond blossoms, so we had no idea what we were doing!) The candids were fantastic, fun, and captured the mood of the whole event, and we love them. We had been really clear with her that since we had eloped and because we had waited so long for the event, we really did not want to have to “disappear” from cocktail hour for photos and wanted to spend as much time with our guests as possible. She made it happen! All portraits were done before the ceremony (our request) and we only had a couple quick snaps in between the ceremony and cocktail hour but spent almost the entire time with our party. The bottom line is that we found Amy to be worth every penny. I’d be surprised to hear that there was someone in the bay area to be as “totally worth it” as she was in terms of wedding vendors. I would highly recommend her and we are so happy that we went with Amy because we will treasure these photos forever.

Beyond that Amy's personality is amazing, shes a joy to be around, and she is incredibly thoughtful. She took the time to send us prints and a hand written note - we are so impressed by her. There are so many stressful moments that you as a couple will go through planning your wedding, don't let this be one of them, hire Amy Little.

Amy is a superwoman. Not only is she an uber talented photographer, there is this easy comfort with her, she's super responsive and timely, and let me tell you she is DEDICATED to ...

getting the shot and getting your beautiful photos to you soon after your event. I can't say enough good things. Hiring her for our engagement shoot and wedding was the best decision ever. From our first conversation, we felt like we'd known her for years and this easy comfort made our shoots fun and breezy —and we're not naturally comfortable in front of the camera. Her humor definitely put us at ease. Her organization ahead of our big day ensured we had a clear schedule and shot list ready so we got all our desired photo moments while optimizing for us to spend as much time as possible with our guests. Have you been to a wedding where the bridal party misses the entire cocktail hour? Not ours! It makes a huge difference. We are over the moon with our photos. They turned out beyond what I expected, especially all these magical candids she managed to get of us and our guests. So much love captured. Highly recommend Amy. She made our day something truly special to remember.

Amy is an absolute gem! If you're looking for a thoughtful and experienced wedding/engagement photographer in northern CA, then Amy should easily be at the top of your list. Not o...

nly did she take *gorgeous* photos for us (not an understatement, at all), but she was also an MVP in helping me to plan out and coordinate a surprise proposal. I already had a general idea of how I wanted to propose, but Amy was incredibly helpful in laying out the logistics to pull it off. This is partly because she's so knowledgeable about a lot of the proposal hotspots in the area. For us, it was Catstello di Amorosa in Napa. But even without prior experience in a particular area or venue, it's pretty clear that she knows exactly what she's doing and how to frame a beautiful shot. Amy was the first professional photographer either of us has hired, so as expected, we did feel a bit awkward to start off when posing or taking "plandid" photos. But Amy was a great coach in letting us know what to do or how to position ourselves for a truly natural feel. On top of that, Amy is very, very easy to work with--she's highly responsive, reliably punctual, has great creative direction and is genuinely excited for you and your partner (basically, she's your one-woman hypeman). 10/10 would absolutely recommend!!

If you are looking for someone who can take staggeringly beautiful photographs that are stylistically timeless and classic while also incorporating modern sensibilities, you should...

probably hire Amy Little to be your photographer. /// If you want all that and you are additionally interested in having someone who will make you feel supported about your decisions, talk nerdy on logistics, help you make sure that your plans make sense, be a calming influence on you and those around you during your event, snap your weird uncle right back into line should he fall out of it, reassure you if you need it, and generally be a hell of a good time to be around, you should definitely hire Amy Little to be your photographer. /// Quick recap: If you have excellent taste, you should work with Amy. If you have excellent taste and you’re rad, you should absolutely work with Amy. /// Amy is fucking awesome (can I drop f-bombs on the Knot? Is it like a PG-13 rating — I get one for free, right?). She's also a total professional, and she'll make sure that everything is clear from the get-go and properly set up for success. You'll know what to expect and how everything will go down. She'll check in to make sure everything is running smoothly and brainstorm solutions with you if anything isn't. She'll laugh at your extensive overuse of profanity and make irreverent jokes with you. She may ask your vendors to slightly alter the chair layout when she notices (before anyone else) that they’re a little off balance or not where you’d asked them to be. She'll immediately feel like a part of your family (but the good part of your family that you genuinely like and can be yourself around). She’ll even make people who absolutely hate having their photo taken feel comfortable and at ease. /// Amy also helped us navigate the uncertainty of Covid with tremendous grace and unwavering empathy. Our wedding was originally scheduled for the summer of 2020, and when that went sideways, Amy committed to sticking with us, and she was absurdly patient as we jockeyed dates around. When we pivoted to a smaller event at a different venue, Amy was kind enough to join us to scout the location and discuss timing for the day and the ideal schedule from a lighting standpoint. And if you’re thinking ‘whoa! I don’t need that level of involvement from my photographer!’ please be assured that she follows quintessential vampire rules: An explicit invitation is required. Having Amy as a cheerleader and stalwart beacon of support was huge. And that sort of compassion comes included by default — just like the good kind of family. /// Regardless of what you're having photographed, you're going to have to make a lot of decisions, and a lot of them will be stressful. This one doesn't need to be. Hire Amy. You'll have a stupid amount of fun, and you'll have a gorgeous set of images. And — probably at some point in there — you'll also have ice cream and / or cupcakes. You can't go wrong.

ement photos, during when we had to cancel our wedding, and truly there for us when we finally had our wedding to capture every moment and then some along the way. I'm personally very critical and Amy's eye for shots, lighting, perspective is unique. It blows other standard photographers out of the water. When first deciding her as our photographer, all of her photos on her profile/portfolio were straight up fire! Every. Single. One. And this is only about her photography skill....Her personality is the best extra bonus anyone could ask for. Amy is the most thoughtful, go out of her way, easy to be around person and we are truly grateful for all that she has done for us and capturing our special life moments. ~Jessica and Ravi

d that in Amy. She had us fill out a questionnaire about our love languages before the day of the shoot, and she used that information to create the right authentic vibe for us. As a person, she is very sweet, easygoing, and fun, and we had a lot of laughs together. We can't recommend Amy enough!

We will gladly contact her for our wedding!

Experienced, profesional, flexible, attentive Amy captured our engagement. She was incredibly flexible with our ever changing schedule. Surprise engagements plans can change at th...

e drop of a hat, and with the unfortunate fires in Napa valley our engagement location changed several times. Once we finally found our location Amy was welcoming, creative, professional and enthusiastic. We felt at ease with her guidance throughout the entire photo shoot. She sent us a "sneak speak" a couple hours after the shoot. Which we were incredibly excited about. The sneak speak gave us the opportunity to announce to our immediate family our engagement. The finalized photos came earlier than promised and simply "wowed" us! We would definitely recommend Amy to anyone.

e time and taking us to a second location that she found on her own to ensure we got the perfect shots. All of the photos she took are absolutely stunning and really capture the special moments we had on that day. We were also extremely impressed by Amy's attentiveness after the photo shoot - she turned around initial photos really quickly for us to share with friends & family and then scheduled a full reveal where she walked us through the entire gallery, even offering to edit any photos once we'd digested them all. Could not recommend Amy more!

Amy captured the beauty of our special day and exactly how it felt to be there. We are still in awe of how beautiful our photos are! Not only are the pictures absolutely gorgeous, ...

but Amy has the warmest, kindest, personality. We had an intimate elopement with some family members in our presence, and for a bunch of people not used to taking pictures, Amy made us feel super comfortable... like she was an old family friend. She took time to truly get to know my (now) husband and I before the event, which meant the world to us. The whole process with Amy has been an absolute pleasure.

We clearly picked the right photographer when we picked Amy Little. Look through her photos, and you'll find life, energy, vibrance. After looking at other photographers' photos, i...

t was very clear who we liked the most. Her website has a ton of info, galleries of past shoots, upfront pricing information, etc. Throughout the whole process it was very clear she was an experienced professional, knew exactly what she was doing, and could handle it all so easily she never added any stress to anything. She was very willing to work with us on our particular plans. We started with a several-hour family hike in the rain and 20+mpph winds, and she was right at home in all of it. She scrambled up a steep and wet rocky slope at one point to get the right angle for a shot, and got everyone arranged in photogenic locales with good lighting. Our event was much more focused on movement and doing things, and her photos worked really well with that. We looked through her other photos though, and she seemed equally talented wtih still lifes, black and whites, and whatever else suited the different occasions. What really stood out though is how genuine all the photos felt- if you're looking for a bunch of photos where everyone lines up and says cheese and looks the exact same they do in thousands of other photos, she's probably as good at that as anyone. But, if you want photos where each persons' personality comes through, where there's laughter and joy and tears, that's where Amy really shines, in capturing the genuine interactions between people. I can't rave about her enough. She never once added stress to the event day, did a lot of things big and small to make everything go smoothly (from finding a new shoot location when the weather ruined our first choice, to setting up chairs when we had to move from one room to another, to adding some combinations to the portrait list that we'd overlooked, to being at ease in conversation with family members across all ages and cultures and political groups and everything else). The photos turned out really well, with fast turnaround well-within what the contract said. She even gave us a few early ones we could use for a family Christmas card. Check out her website; it has all kinds of photo samples, upfront pricing and availability information, and nearly anything else you could ask for. Her photos speak for themselves. We're very happy clients.

Amy was great to work with! She captured some great moments and made the experience truly unforgettable. I had planned the engagement as a surprise, but needed to reschedule last ...

minute as the Kincade Fire prevented us from doing the shoot at our originally planned winery. Amy was very flexible about changing locations and arrived promptly to capture the special moment. Highly recommended!

re to hang out with, her photos are amazing! I could not have asked for a better photographer. Amy's photos are the perfect blend of perfectly staged moments and hilarious "bloopers". My entire family is trying to think of another event we can have just to invite Amy back! Hire Amy. You will not be sorry!

TLDR: Amy was the first photographer we talked to and instantly fell in love. We felt confident to the point that we never shopped around and hired her immediately. She’s #1 funny,...

caring, trustworthy, and to top it off THE BEST PHOTOGRAPHER in terms of quality of work. Her abilities as a photographer can withstand any last minute changes in weather or unexpected circumstances. She’ll deliver even more than expected and capture moments as if you were there. You'll be able to relive every moment through her pictures. We wanted a photographer who had shot at our venue before, and after looking at all the other photographers, her photos were far superior. We went into our initial conversation not knowing what to expect and ended up with a friend after 2-3 hours of casually chatting. We honestly hired Amy based off of our gut feeling and ended up on top. I know a lot of brides rave about their photographers and say their photographer is the best, but I can confidently say that Amy’s photos has something special. She makes you feel as if you’re there and can almost feel the action. I like to think in categories, so here are a couple of distinguishing points. Detail Oriented: Amy is extremely attentive and lived up to my perfectionist personality. She'll position you so that you're always centered. She always took pictures of my good side and knew how to position everyone to align with the part in my hair. She always knew how to balance the different heights amongst our wedding party. Also, my dress had a long train and she knew how to position it so that my dress always looked great. Friendship: We invited her to our rehearsal + rehearsal dinner, and she instantly fit right in. A groomsman later came up to me and said, "I'm going to remember this experience for my future wedding, cause I definitely want a photographer who I would want to invite to the rehearsal dinner." Amazing Quality: We had a wedding party of 12 high energy friends. She knew exactly how to get all the photographs we asked for and more! Also, I have been a bridesmaid at a few weddings and have seen a couple of my friends' wedding photos. Every photographer posts their best photos on Instagram, which can skew your perception of their work. But once I received my album, I didn't feel like I only liked a select few photos. I loved every one of my photos and can attest that her quality of work is top notch throughout the entire wedding day. I have no idea how she made both my husband and I look so good! (We are not photogenic at all). AMY is FIRE! Is she worth it? Heck yea! I'd say she's priceless and would book her again in a heartbeat!

Amy is an absolutely incredible photographer and person. I cannot begin to express how grateful we are that we chose her for our wedding. Amy is funny, caring, detail oriented and ...

extremely talented. She was able to capture every beautiful moment of our two day wedding (three days if you include the rehearsal dinner!) and at the same time, she got to know our families and made them feel so comfortable in front of the camera. I really cannot recommend Amy enough. If you want your wedding to be photographed impeccably, with love and thought, hire Amy. Seriously, look no further, you have found your photographer.

Amy Little is quite possibly the most wonderful, personable, professional, and engaging photographer that has ever walked this earth! Not to mention a seriously cool person as well...

. I can't begin to express how thankful my husband and I are for her. We first met her down in Florida for engagement pictures. We had so much fun talking and laughing with Amy that I hardly noticed that she was taking pictures. We received the photos exactly when she said we would and they were AMAZING. She kept contact with us throughout our engagement, face-timed with my husband and me multiple times to get a feel of our style and interests and asked us to fill out a survey (separately from each other) that focused on helping Amy get to know and understand our relationship, particular photos we want at the wedding, and any surprises/gifts that she should know about ahead of time to photograph. Amy met us up in North Carolina for the wedding. She arrived early, captured guests, details, special moments, and even came to the "after party" at a bar well past midnight to take more pictures. She is THAT dedicated. Every single picture she took captured our special day perfectly. If that wasn't enough, Amy sent us "sneak peek" photos quickly after our wedding and even face-timed us before sending over all of the pictures to make sure my husband and I had a night off to dedicate to sitting on the couch, drinking a glass of wine, and enjoying the photos together. She truly understands what it's all about. I highly recommend Amy Little to do your wedding photography. She exceeded our expectations in every possible way.

omfortable and candid around her. We have so many amazing shots from our wedding day and are thrilled to have chosen Amy as our photographer!!! She turned around the photos really fast, too :). She was a little above our price range but we splurged and are so glad we did- the colors she uses are so vibrant. A lot of wedding photographers out there edit their beach photographs so washed out- but Amy's colors are true and vivid. We absolutely love them AND her!!!!

Please read the following review very carefully: If you do not book Amy Little, not only will you be missing out on an extraordinary photographer, but a great friend. We booked Amy...

more than a year before our wedding, and over the course of those 365 days, Amy became a friend and confidante, listening to our wedding rants and Skyping us with wine in hand to check on our wedding progress. When she arrived to shoot our wedding, I felt like I had already known her for years and years. Her personality is infectious. When someone really and I mean REALLY loves what they do, they radiate. She radiates. I was so comfortable and at ease having her by my side on the big day. She even put my veil in correctly when I was all flustered right before the ceremony. My family and friends kept asking about her, they adored Amy and continuously commented about her amazing work ethic. She came to shoot our wedding as a friend, but she left as a family member. Like it or not Amy, you have been dubbed an honorary Zagahou. My dear Wedding Wire friends, please, please, please do yourself a favor and book Amy for your wedding day. You will not regret it, I promise you.

Amy took my engagement pictures, and boy do I ever wish I could have snatched her up for the wedding too! She is seriously the most giving, hard-working, wonderful, fun, nothing-is...

-too-much-for-her-to-handle person!! It was 40 degrees and raining when we were getting our pictures taken, and she didn't bat an eye about getting soaked to the bone snapping pictures, laying on the cold ground to get the perfect angle, and splashing through puddles as we went all over Washington, DC. Not only did she give everything she had and then some into our shoot, she delivered the most breathtaking pictures in the world! Amy captured who we are as a couple perfectly, and now the only problem is deciding which pictures we like best! Amy isn't just a photographer, she's an artist, and one of the best people you'll ever meet in your life. And she's also downright hysterical.
