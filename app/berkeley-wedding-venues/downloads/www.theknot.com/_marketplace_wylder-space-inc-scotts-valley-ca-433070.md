Wylder Space nailed our Fall wedding with their menu. From the get go, Molly and Kyle were super helpful in narrowing in on our vision, and gave great recommendations for autumn th...

emed entrees/sides and appetizers. The flexibility was so helpful too, we were able to adjust and add things to our menu as our ideas evolved throughout the planning process. Additionally, Wylder made some excellent alternative plates for our friends/family with dietary restrictions. The serving staff and bartending was very friendly too, smiles all around, all night. Professionals at the peak of their craft!

menu was crisp, clean and simply mouthwatering. They seamlessly accommodated for our group of meat-eaters and vegetarians. I have used Wylder Space several times now and have recommended them to several friends over the years. Looking forward to hosting another event with Molly.

to, accommodating various allergies with finesse. Wylder Space and Chef Molly went above and beyond, making our wedding culinary experience truly unforgettable. In a remote area with challenging logistics (e.g., no commercial kitchen), Wylder Space excelled. The compliments on the food are still pouring in, with standout praise for the vegan dish, a far cry from the typical cauliflower steak. Chef Molly's flexibility was remarkable—accommodating last-minute menu adjustments and handling unexpected changes in guest numbers due to illnesses. Thank you Wylder Space for making the food at our wedding one of the highlights of the day!

Wylder Spaces is incredible! The menu they chose was thoughtful and the food exceeded my (and my guests') expectations. I was also very impressed with their service.

Molly and her team are made of absolute magic! The food was incredible and perfect for our intimate wedding with our closest friends. The communication we had with Molly was great!...

The tasting was also incredible, and they were so accommodating! I highly recommend Wylder Space for any event! Our guests were raving about the food and team. We immensely appreciate everything and are very much thankful for an incredible experience.

g - we were v impressed w/ the presentation and flavors. We were somewhat concerned between then and the wedding because communication ie. getting information or questions answers was not always easy, and there were some details missed by Wylder that luckily my Coordinator thought of… but I have to say my concerns completely disappeared on wedding day and Molly’s entire crew was so professional, gracious and went above and beyond with service. They did all the clean up and our guests are STILL raving about the food.

erything - and I do mean everything - was absolutely delicious. From the lamb lollipops with sweet potato puree to the butternut squash sage ravioli to the affogato and coffee bar with Dutch Stroopwafels, our wedding food FAR exceeded our expectations. My guest raved to me about our menu - not only throughout the night - but weeks after our wedding. My dad even proudly attempted to recreate Molly's blackberry cabernet reduction sauce from the lambs served in the Hors d'Oeuvres - he loved it so much. Truly, if you are planning a wedding or event in the Santa Cruz / Monterey / Big Sur area, I highly, highly, HIGHLY recommending contacting Wylder Space. Absolutely exceptional to work with - from start to finish.

I am a professional event planner and hired Molly and her team to cater and bartend my 50-person outdoor forest wedding in September 2021. I highly recommend Wylder Space to anyone...

looking for an incredible and unique food experience for their next wedding or event. Wylder Space delivered an exceptional and delicious six-course food and wine paired menu. Molly was a joy to work with and the creative process of choosing the menu was so enjoyable and fun. From the plating to the flavors and service, it was beyond our wildest dreams. Molly and her staff were friendly and professional. I didn't have to think twice about setting up, service timing, clean up, and load-out - they are self-sufficient and manage their time well. Our guests loved the food -- we barely had any food waste because everyone ate everything on their plates (which I love!) This is next-level catering and honestly, it's the best food I've ever had at any event I've planned or attended. Thanks for bringing our dream to life.

We had the most incredible experience with Wylder Space and cannot recommend them enough. Molly and the entire Wylder team are absolute pros across the board and it shows at every ...

step of the way — from the thoughtful tasting experience and custom menu planning to the continuous communication and impeccable execution. We used our own venue, so Wylder was especially helpful in mapping out our space, figuring out rental quantities, and lending their expertise on details big and small. They were an invaluable source of guidance throughout our entire planning process and we could not have done it without them. But what really stole the show was the FOOD. We had no less than 20 guests come up to tell us that their dinner was the best wedding food they had ever had. People were in awe. The presentation and meal itself were the stuff of Michelin-starred restaurants — with all ingredients sourced from local and sustainable producers. Wylder so far surpasses the typical "wedding caterer" that they honestly need their own category. Book them now!

Hire Wylder Spaces. Honestly, they are all just the sweetest, kindest, loveliest people. They were absolutely perfect for our small rustic elopement and made a menu that went above...

and far beyond our wildest dreams. All of the food they made for us, from the handcrafted smoothies & craft avocado toast for our (very very) early morning rise to the incredible charcuterie board (with bone marrow!!!!) to the beautiful brunch spread. They even prepped ingredients for us to make handmade pizza that evening! Not to mention that each and every worker were so so so kind and really went the extra mile to make us feel so special. Thank you so much Molly & the crew for creating such amazing memories for us and so sorry that the review is quite literally a year late! :)

d spots and it was not even close. The freshness, flavor, customizability, vibe and staff are/were amazing. Fresh seedless avocado filled with beet hummus drizzled with pomegranate molasses?!?...that was not on any standard caterer menu and was soooo good. Fast forward to our wedding a few weeks ago and we and our guests were blown away. We couldn't have been happier with Wylder Space and Molly for our wedding eve. Beyond the food, she was a pleasure to work with. And we look forward to hanging out with her because she is also really cool! Thank you Molly!
