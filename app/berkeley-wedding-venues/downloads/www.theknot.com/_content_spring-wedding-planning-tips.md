## Wedding Color Ideas for Spring

While [pastel wedding color palettes](https://www.theknot.com/content/pastel-wedding-color-scheme) are definitely a popular choice for the spring season, you're not restricted to Easter egg-inspired hues (unless that's your thing). An [all-white wedding color palette](https://www.theknot.com/content/modern-white-wedding-details) will create a modern, sophisticated look that aligns with the season's sense of renewal and rebirth. Classic colors like navy blue and black will add contrast and drama to lighter hues.

## Spring Wedding Themes

Your spring wedding theme can ultimately be anything that you want, but there are a few themes and aesthetics that especially embrace the season. A [fairytale-themed wedding](https://www.theknot.com/content/fairytale-wedding-theme) is our first pick for a spring wedding, since this theme is all about enchanting floral arrangements, romantic garden venues and dreamy color pairings, like blush and blue. Taking a [classic, formal approach](https://www.theknot.com/content/classic-wedding-ideas) is another wedding theme for spring that we love—think ballroom venue, sparkling candelabra centerpieces, black-tie attire and exquisite calligraphy details. Finally, we love a [cottagecore wedding theme](https://www.theknot.com/content/cottagecore-wedding-inspiration) for an intimate backyard wedding.

## Spring Wedding Attire

Whether you're shopping for [spring wedding guest dresses](https://www.theknot.com/content/what-to-wear-to-a-spring-wedding) or pulling inspiration for your own ensemble, spring weddings generally provide more flexibility when it comes to the attire. Daytime events, such as a brunch wedding or afternoon ceremony, call for more casual styles (and lots of [floral prints](https://www.theknot.com/content/floral-bridesmaid-dresses-to-shop), of course). With the weather getting warmer, dress hemlines can be higher and fabrics can be lighter.

## Spring Wedding Flowers

From peonies and tulips to daffodils, roses, hyacinths and lilacs, nearly all of the most popular wedding flowers are [in bloom during the spring season](https://www.theknot.com/content/spring-wedding-flowers). Mother Nature is also bursting with some of the most beautiful nontraditional wedding flowers during spring, like cherry blossoms, dogwood branches and various greenery.

Sticking to flowers that are in season around the time of your wedding will give you the best chance at finding the freshest, budget-friendly blooms. Tulips and daffodils are affordable yet classic spring wedding flowers, and both flowers come in a range of colors and varieties. Sweet peas, hyacinths and lilacs will create spring arrangements with a whimsical, playful feel. If understated elegance is more your vibe, take a cue from one of the most famous spring brides of all time, the [Princess of Wales](https://www.theknot.com/content/prince-william-kate-middleton-wedding), who carried a bouquet composed of Lily of the Valley, myrtle, sweet William, hyacinths and ivy. We recommend [chatting with your florist](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/florists) to decide on flowers that will work for your wedding vision, but in the meantime, here are some ideas.

### 1\. Freesia Wedding Boutonnieres

![white freesia wedding boutonnieres](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/9b7f301e-4490-47c7-9ef8-5ea48b1e1ee5~rs_768.h-cr_7.0.3607.4800)

_[Photo: Katie Rivera Photography](https://www.katieriveraphoto.com/)_

Fragrant and elegant, this quintessential spring flower looks stylish all on its own as a boutonniere.

### 2\. Flower-Lined Wedding Ceremony Aisle

![aerial view of outdoor wedding ceremony aisle lined with white flower arrangements along the side and flower petals scattered down the aisle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/069cc8d2-7a62-4399-96ba-462a6ae97d91~rs_768.h-cr_504.1884.3488.5862)

_[Photo: Brett Hickman Photographers](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/brett-hickman-photographers-tustin-ca-665908)_

When it comes to spring wedding decor, we say pile on the flowers. Create a dreamy backdrop for your vow exchange by lining the aisle with oversized arrangements and tons of petals.

### 3\. Simple Spring Wedding Centerpieces

![simple spring wedding centerpieces with white tulips and amaryllis in glass vases](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/5e68ae29-e1fa-4cb7-8d27-cd5aa6c966f6~rs_768.h-cr_0.25.1933.2602)

_[Photo: Almond Leaf Studios](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/almond-leaf-studios-asheville-nc-836200),__[Floral design: New Creations Flowers](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/new-creations-flowers-davisburg-mi-1039374)_

We love these chic centerpieces as March wedding ideas, since they feature a combination of winter flowers (amaryllis) and [spring flowers](https://www.theknot.com/content/spring-wedding-flowers) (tulips) to transition between the two seasons. 

### 4\. Flower Dog Collar

![golden doodle puppy wearing a collar of greenery and white flowers for wedding day](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/19ba89ad-da2e-4bc6-917d-00b72c795ca8~rs_768.h-cr_0.221.3555.4961)

_[Photo: Madeleine Collins Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/madeleine-collins-photography-laguna-beach-ca-1091021)_

If your pet is playing a role in your wedding day, don't forget to dress them up in a [special outfit or accessory](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-dog-ideas), like a floral collar or greenery-adorned leash.

### 5\. Garden Rose Wedding Centerpiece

![elegant spring wedding centerpiece with white garden roses and ivory flowers in small stone urn vase](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/08a60b64-3a4d-404c-89dc-bf2ca9e01d55~rs_768.h-cr_0.57.3533.4768)

_[Photo: Corbin Gurkin Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/corbin-gurkin-photography-charleston-sc-767241)_

Display centerpieces using low stone vases (instead of glass or metal) for a sweet cottage-inspired look.

### 6\. Floral Wedding Ceremony Arch

![outdoor wedding ceremony arch made from birch branches decorated with white flowers](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/462c536d-7b4f-4a00-9738-dac2466c5bb1~rs_768.h-cr_0.408.2448.3672)

_[Photo: Mike Larson Photographer](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/mike-larson-photographer-san-luis-obispo-ca-536132)_

White birch branches are the perfect backdrop for springy white flowers, such as the hydrangeas, dogwood blossoms, lilacs and chamomile on this ceremony arch.

### 7\. Classic Spring Wedding Bouquet

![bride holding classic white wedding bouquet with roses, pieris japonica and eucalyptus](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/7909bced-26f8-4a03-86b2-4b66bbe5c21b~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.4232.5643)

_[Photo: Jenny Fu](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/jenny-futography-wedding-photographer-nyc-new-york-ny-768384)_

Add spring elements, like pieris japonica and white scabiosa flowers, to bring a seasonal touch to a classic bouquet of roses.

### Find your kind of venue

From barns to ballrooms, discover reception venues that feel like you.

### 8\. Monogrammed Greenery Wreath

![greenery eucalyptus wreath decorated with white flowers and couple's monogram in the center](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/88e1fa7e-052e-4b52-9417-d1f14fffb430~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1500.2000)

_[Photo: Rachel Havel Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/rachel-havel-photography-colorado-springs-co-767116)_

A fresh wreath is perfect for gates, doors, your [getaway car](https://www.theknot.com/content/the-getaway-car) or any other area at your wedding venue that needs a bit of sprucing up.

### 9\. Hellebore Wedding Boutonnieres

![green hellebore wedding boutonnieres on a wooden tray](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/42affc9e-b8b5-48e9-b5b6-5cd8b88ab023~rs_768.h-cr_0.101.2428.3338)

These underrated flowers naturally bloom during the winter and early spring. The green color reflects the refreshing energy of seasons changing, but you can also find them in ivory, mauve, peach and dark purple hues.

### 10\. Soft Blues, Purples, Blush and Ivory

![Romantic Groom and Bride](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/d4cc7568-6004-4bbe-a1e1-2edaa73bbe77~rs_768.h-cr_33.448.1322.2167)

_[Photo: Rebecca Ou Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/rebecca-ou-photography-new-york-city-ny-962420)_

If you're having a spring wedding, choose a bouquet with classic spring hues—like this soft combination of purple, blue, blush and ivory. 

### 11\. Green and White Wedding Bouquet

![classic spring wedding bouquet with white flowers and greenery](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/9c71bfe9-632f-4b8b-b341-8b2ae4b9deb8~rs_768.h-cr_83.0.972.667)

_[Photo: Onelove Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/onelove-photography-pasadena-ca-2030853)_

Use white flowers to contrast with a bouquet of maidenhair ferns and other whimsical greenery.

### 12\. Blush Wedding Bouquet with Ribbons

![bridesmaid wearing black and pink floral print dress holding small bouquet of blush roses, white ranunculus and greenery](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/bf0f1450-f9ab-4926-96d5-9327d53be5da~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.3006.4008)

_[Photo: Melanie Duerkopp Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/melanie-duerkopp-photography-san-francisco-ca-526334),__[Floral design: Studio Mondine](https://www.studiomondine.com/)_

Small bouquets are perfect for bridesmaids or anyone who doesn't want to be weighed down by carrying a heavy arrangement. This sweet design is dressed up with soft blush ribbons that complement the flowers.

### 13\. Tulip Wedding Centerpiece

![spring wedding centerpiece featuring white tulips in hollowed out wooden log](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/2e479f3e-9cc9-42f3-94b7-aeb8d4b97368~rs_768.h-cr_0.300.1800.2700)

_[Photo: Amber Gress Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/amber-gress-photography-brooklyn-ny-951929),__[Floral design: Lewis Miller Design](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/lewis-miller-design-new-york-city-ny-822357)_

Think outside the vase and use hollowed-out logs or wooden troughs for your [spring wedding centerpieces](https://www.theknot.com/content/spring-wedding-centerpieces) instead. The addition of potting soil in this arrangement creates the illusion that the tulips are planted right on the table.

### 14\. Pink Galore

![Flower Girls in Pink Dresses and Holding Wicker Flower Baskets](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/c64aefac-5d85-4462-9d29-bf9ed0a8e65c~rs_768.h-cr_0.243.1458.2187)

_[Photo: Daniel Colvin Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/daniel-colvin-photography-houston-tx-866027)_

We love a monochrome moment—especially the way the florals match the flower girls. Perfect for a spring wedding. 

### 15\. Elegant Spring Wedding Bouquet

![bride holding elegant spring wedding bouquet with white orchids, roses and pieris japonica](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/d79979e7-9afc-49ce-a103-490ba4e46ac7~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1080.1440)

For an early June wedding, tropical orchids are a subtle nod to the upcoming transition between spring and summer.

### 16\. Cherry Blossom Wedding Centerpiece

![wedding escort table decorated with a centerpiece of pink cherry blossom branches and pink peonies](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/da56d6df-8ee0-4ec4-89d2-4de07d646b93~rs_768.h-cr_56.0.1827.1328)

_[Photo: Ryon : Lockhart Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/ryon-lockhart-photography-ny-+-la-+-destination-ca-746845),__[Floral design: Blade Floral and Event Designs](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/blade-floral-and-event-designs-llc-new-york-ny-211705)_

Flowering cherry blossom branches are a favorite April wedding idea, since they're usually in full bloom by that time. Use them in centerpieces or to accent other spaces throughout the venue, such as the welcome table.

### 17\. Blush, Blue and Cream Bouquets

![Bride and Bridesmaids Hold Blush, Blue and Cream Bouquets With Greenery](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/eab697fc-8917-4804-8098-08c821bb00d9~rs_768.h-cr_82.0.1375.970)

_[Photo: Amative Creative](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/amative-creative-lynchburg-va-660977)_

We love the pops of blue in this otherwise subtle spring bouquet. Plus, matching with your bridesmaids is always a beautiful way to add cohesion to your wedding photos.

### 18\. White Lilac Wedding Bouquet

![small spring wedding bouquet with white lilacs](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/2c9bce06-e198-4ab8-b903-4573b298bb3e~rs_768.h-cr_0.205.2640.3725)

Keep your bouquet simple by carrying a small posy of lilacs, which can be found in white, purple and pink varieties. What the arrangement lacks in size will be made up by the heavenly smell.

## Spring Wedding Decorations

If you're getting married in March, April or May, turn to Mother Nature for your spring wedding inspiration and decor. Whether you incorporate floral motifs into your [wedding invitations](https://www.theknot.com/paper/invitations/wedding?seasons=spring), add hollow eggshells to your centerpieces or deck out your reception venue with a canopy of wisteria, there are so many pretty wedding ideas for spring. For a garden venue, use moss, butterflies and terracotta pots for a vibe inspired by a gardener's potting shed. Take a more classic approach by draping lush flower garlands across chairs and banisters, or decorate with vintage botanical illustrations [inspired by John Derian](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-decor-trends).

### 19\. Pink, Lavender and Green Tablescape

![Pink, Lavender and Green Tablescape](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/edbbc156-20a9-48ed-8257-39d069907c6f~rs_768.h)

[Choosing your spring wedding venue](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace) will set the scene for the whole shebang. Choose a walled garden for a storybook romance vibe, or something more uncommon, like a modern art museum, for a unique backdrop. 

### 21\. Greenery Chandeliers

![three gold antique style chandeliers hanging from clear top reception tent decorated with greenery vines](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/7d32703c-b4b3-4f3f-af9c-a892c2d6f05d~rs_768.h-cr_0.35.1080.1475)

_[Photo: Anagram Photo](https://anagramphoto.com/weddings)_

Whether suspended above your ceremony altar, [wedding sweetheart table](https://www.theknot.com/content/sweetheart-table-ideas) or dance floor, a greenery covered chandelier gives off the prettiest fairytale vibes.

### 22\. Lattice Wedding Stationery Suite

You already know that your [wedding invitations](https://www.theknot.com/paper/invitations/wedding?seasons=spring) should reflect the theme of your special day, and what better way to do that for a spring wedding than with a garden-inspired design? This vintage-style lattice motif is perfectly complemented by the traditional calligraphy script.

### 23\. Wedding Welcome Sign

![floral wedding sign for your spring celebration](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/0242c553-3050-439f-a72f-3ef8518eb08b~rs_768.h-cr_132.0.1909.1333)

We'll always love a pretty wedding sign. While there's no need to go overboard with signage at every turn, one or two can be useful when directing guests through your venue. For a spring wedding, this wooden board with elegant calligraphy and simple greenery feels just right. 

### 24\. Vow Books

![vows book for your spring wedding](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/56245e1b-f0ce-4271-8f18-91a41b43fb7a~rs_768.h-cr_82.0.2918.3781)

_[Photo: Mary Claire Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/mary-claire-photography-phoenix-az-612726)_

You can match even the tiniest of details to your spring wedding decorations. This [keepsake vow book](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-vow-notebooks) is functional and beautiful at the same time. 

### 25\. Fern Wedding Ceremony Aisle Markers

![outdoor wedding ceremony aisle lined with large sword fern plants next to wooden crossback chairs](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/2b212504-b248-42d4-8270-43f200f66444~rs_768.h-cr_8.0.4508.6000)

_[Photo: Brumley and Wells](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/brumley-and-wells-durango-co-376924)_

Looking for spring wedding ideas that don't rely on flowers? Try using fresh greenery instead. Statement greens, like these sword ferns, bring a fresh, natural theme to your wedding space. They can look amazing as part of the decor all on their own—and you can add as many or as few flowers as you'd like.

### 26\. Red Flowers and Pink Draping

![Red Flowers Adorn Pink Draping](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/baae0833-3139-4add-bf2d-781b18cf6ddd~rs_768.h-cr_0.6.1080.1446)

_[Photo: Hannah Forsberg](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/hannah-forsberg-%7C-fine-art-wedding-photographer-atlanta-ga-1023906)_

Who says bold colors should be reserved for summer weddings? If you want a vibrant spring wedding, go for it. Tying punchy red florals with softer pinks and periwinkle blues keep it in season, but a bit further from the usual delicate spring palette. 

### 27\. Butterfly Wedding Seating Chart

![wedding seating chart display decorated with faux butterflies in pastel blue, pink and yellow colors](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/6d43ac8f-5fc0-4af4-bb78-90db590554d6~rs_768.h-cr_293.0.6266.4480)

Butterfly details are some of our favorite wedding ideas for spring. Add butterfly illustrations to your wedding stationery and other paper goods, or incorporate them through 3D accents like this seating chart display.

### 29\. Pink Signage

Nothing beats an outdoor reception at a spring wedding, especially if it's adorned with gorgeous flowers and a waterfront view. 

### 36\. Wedding Chair Decor

![wedding idea for spring wooden cross back chair decorated with white roses and greenery](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/03da8586-c7c7-49f3-872a-a71f0772d772~rs_768.h-cr_0.451.4008.5795)

These tiny bud vases double as [escort cards](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-escort-card-displays) and little mementos that your guests can take home at the end of the night.

### 38\. Vintage Stamps

![close up of vintage assorted green stamps on wedding invitation envelope](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/6c9986c8-7b58-4771-ab0c-0974f8d58f02~rs_768.h-cr_0.98.3360.4578)

_[Photo: Amy Caroline Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/amy-caroline-photography-denver-co-768830)_

Stamps are a necessity when mailing your invitations, so why not get creative with your [wedding postage](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-invitation-postage-pointers)? Vintage stamps will add one-of-a-kind charm to the envelopes and elevate the overall design. We recommend chatting with a [professional stationery designer](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/invitations) for their advice about using vintage stamps, since it can be tricky to estimate the right amount of postage.

### 39\. Cloche Centerpieces

![Floral cloche centerpieces for your spring wedding](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/289d7edc-620c-4370-b358-ca8cef11c8a3~rs_768.h-cr_0.158.2000.2825)

_[Photo: Katie Shuler Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/katie-shuler-photography-thousand-oaks-ca-557831)_

Turn your flowers into museum-worthy designs by showcasing them in glass cloche jars. Pair them with candles to illuminate your centerpieces after dark, or turn the jars into an interactive seating chart by writing names and table assignments on the glass. 

### 40\. Folding Wrought Iron Chairs

![rows of white vintage wrought iron folding chairs on the grass at outdoor wedding ceremony](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/bb36ecdd-c5b8-445d-86a9-8ea93800a3c1~rs_768.h-cr_0.393.2330.3500)

With or without cushions, vintage metal chairs are so cute for an English garden-themed wedding in the spring.

### 41\. Terracotta Pot Escort Card Display

![spring wedding idea with guest names written on wooden popsicle sticks and displayed in terracotta pots with white flowers and moss](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/3aaba81d-2419-4fa4-acdc-0ecf5a1f2cfa~rs_768.h-cr_206.0.3939.2800)

_[Photo: Jainé Kershner Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/jaine-kershner-photography-brooklyn-ny-528553)_

_[Photo: Josh & Dana Fernandez](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/josh-and-dana-fernandez-houston-tx-967962)_

You can't go wrong with a [black and white wedding color palette](https://www.theknot.com/content/black-white-wedding-style-tips). For your invitations, tap into the spring season by adding floral sketches.

### 43\. Hanging Greenery Decor

![Hanging greenery for your spring wedding ideas](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/54edefd3-ef6c-497f-9b35-26af1e49e1d9~rs_768.h-cr_0.4.2475.3304)

_[Photo: Amanda Nippoldt Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/amanda-nippoldt-photography-minneapolis-mn-641375)_

Counteract the simplicity of [low centerpieces](https://www.theknot.com/content/low-wedding-centerpiece-ideas) by adding hanging greenery vines above your tables. Even if you only do this above the head table, it's an instant statement piece that will capture guests' attention. 

### 44\. Hummingbird Drink Toppers

![Hummingbird drink toppers for your boho spring wedding](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/c7a0eb93-f5d9-4931-a381-6bd31fdb7073~rs_768.h-cr_0.320.3840.5440)

### 45\. Patterned Table Linens

![floral patterned table cloths for your spring wedding decor](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/8b490c7b-2b0e-4794-b0f0-7f14130701e6~rs_768.h-cr_0.17.1080.1457)

_[Photo: Lisa Blume Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/lisa-blume-photography-chicago-il-230428)_

Floral-print tablecloths are a no-brainer when it comes to your spring wedding decorations. You can go with a pastel colorway like this for something classic and sweet, or choose a bright floral print for a dash of color. 

### 46\. Colored Glassware

![colored vintage inspired glassware for your spring wedding](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/dd310293-080f-4a04-9003-fcde86623757~rs_768.h-cr_0.250.3000.4250)

### 47\. Outdoor Reception Tables

_[Photo: Katerina Kutas Photography](https://katerinakutas.com/),__[Event planning: Ariel Chiu Events](https://arielchiu.com/),__[Floral design: Copihue Floral Studio](https://www.copihuestudio.com/home/)_

Weather permitting, spring is the perfect time to host an outdoor reception before summer temperatures (and bugs) kick in. Plus, if your venue happens to come with a view, you can scale back on the amount of tabletop decor you'll need.

### 48\. Pink Taper Candles

![spring pink taper candles for your wedding decor](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/32487a77-ae6f-4941-b05d-9ca98a98f86d~rs_768.h-cr_0.175.2100.2975)

Adding colored taper candles is a quick and affordable way to add personality to in-house linens and plates (which tend to be all white and very simple) supplied by your venue or caterer. 

### 49\. Paper Butterfly Garlands

![monarch butterfly garlands for your spring wedding decor ideas](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/f7063473-5a4c-418d-aaca-3cf6c5152cfb~rs_768.h-cr_0.139.1667.2362)

_[Photo: The Brauns](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/the-brauns-dayton-oh-360122)_

Imagine dancing and dining under a canopy of butterflies. Use these garlands to cover an unsightly ceiling at your venue or to simply create an enchanting garden-inspired setting. 

### 50\. Scalloped Dinner Plates

![scalloped wedding reception plates](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/186f343a-a274-419e-9197-772748916b8c~rs_768.h-cr_0.250.3000.4250)

_[Photo: Emily Loeppke](https://emilyloeppke.com/),__[Event planning: Coco Rose Design](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/coco-rose-design-summerland-ca-865798)_

Get on board with the [scalloped wedding trend](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-decor-trends) by adding funky charger plates to your place settings. 

## Spring Wedding Cakes & Food

With temperatures rising, light fare and refreshing drinks are a great way to keep guests fueled for a spring wedding. For the reception meal, consult with your [wedding caterer](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/catering) to design a menu that highlights the season, whether by using in-season veggies like asparagus or serving quail eggs on demitasse spoons for a chic appetizer that references Easter.

White wine sangria garnished with fresh lemons and seasonal fruits is a simple [signature cocktail](https://www.theknot.com/content/your-ultimate-signature-cocktail-finder) for a spring garden wedding. Mint juleps are a nod to the Kentucky Derby if you're having a May wedding around the time of the Triple Crown, while French 75s, mimosas and watermelon or strawberry mojitos are other cocktail hour favorites inspired by the season.

### 51\. Seared Tuna Appetizers

![server holding wooden tray with seared tuna bites on metal spoons](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/c8712970-353f-40fd-b23b-b167c2ee3012~rs_768.h-cr_0.33.2048.2764)

_[Photo: Heather Waraksa](https://heatherwaraksa.com/),__[Catering: The Liberty Warehouse](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/the-liberty-warehouse-brooklyn-ny-371369)_

For March and April weddings, embrace the transition away from heavier winter foods with fresh seafood appetizers, like these tuna and wasabi salad bites.

### 52\. Delicate Floral Wedding Cake

![elegant three tier spring wedding cake decorated with pale pink buttercream, ivory flowers and pink roses](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/9b3713f5-3cca-41f1-a328-8fd18f06f93b~rs_768.h-cr_0.35.1080.1475)

_[Photo: Anagram Photo](https://anagramphoto.com/weddings)_

It's no surprise that most wedding cake ideas for spring revolve around decorating with flowers—either real or sugar. This elegant three-tiered design has roses and orchids to add texture to the smooth buttercream.

### 53\. Fresh Lemonade Dispenser

![self serve wedding drink station with lemonade in glass beverage dispenser next to pastel pink floral centerpiece](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/bd6a142a-e17b-4cd2-b1a8-6dac937fa9c3~rs_768.h-cr_0.316.2000.2983)

_[Photo: Katie Shuler Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/katie-shuler-photography-thousand-oaks-ca-557831)_

A [self-serve wedding drink station](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-drink-station-ideas) comes in handy on sunny spring days when the weather is unexpectedly warm (keep this on deck as a May wedding idea, especially if you're getting married toward the second half of the month). Homemade lemonade, cucumber water and fruit-infused water are all refreshing options.

### 54\. Ivy-Covered Wedding Cake

![three tier fondant wedding cake decorated with green ivy vines](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/127281f8-6606-460b-b549-ff4b27496d12~rs_768.h-cr_0.53.4200.5653)

Understated and elegant, this ivy-covered cake is another way to pull inspiration from nature for your spring-themed wedding.

### 55\. Bite-Size Sandwiches

_[Photo: Charla Storey Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/charla-storey-photography-fort-worth-tx-627781)_

Why sip from ordinary champagne flutes or cocktail glasses when you can use coupes instead? Their vintage-inspired look goes along with the aesthetic of a garden soiree.

### 58\. Hand-Painted Two-Tiered Wedding Cake

![Hand-Painted Two-Tiered Wedding Cake](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/ac9ef09c-ff7f-4e29-a3f7-a44093f6dc6b~rs_768.h-cr_0.100.1458.2044)
