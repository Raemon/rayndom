Luckily, we have the answer to this below so you don't make any [wedding registry etiquette mistakes](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-registry-etiquette).

  * How Many Gifts Should Be on a Wedding Registry? | Based on Guest Count | Price Point
  * Is It Rude to Put Expensive Items on Your Wedding Registry?
  * When to Add More Gifts to Your Registry



## How Many Gifts Should Be on a Wedding Registry?

First, you need to decide [where to register for your wedding](https://www.theknot.com/content/complete-registry-store-guide)—guests prefer to have plenty of options while shopping—and learn [how to make a wedding registry](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-registry-26-top-tips). ([The Knot Registry](https://www.theknot.com/registry) is a great option because it has gift cards, cash funds, physical and experience-based gifts and is easy to use for couples and loved ones.) Once you do that we suggest having at least two gifts per guest available to give them the ability to find a product they want to purchase.

Now that you have a general answer to "How many items should I register for a wedding," let's talk about cash funds. To give you guidance into this latest gifting option, we spoke with Jason Rhee, owner of [Rheefined Company](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/rheefined-company-west-hollywood-ca-752941) with over 15 years of planning experience, about the formalities surrounding it. "I encourage couples to make a well-rounded registry to honor the preferences of all their guests. So even if the couple wants to focus on a honeymoon fund, down payment on a house or other experience-based goals, I recommend keeping 50 to 75 physical items across a range of price points. This gives guests freedom to choose, while also gently guiding them." (Here are [examples of wedding registry wording](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-registry-wording) you can use for cash funds.)

For those wondering if it's possible to register for too many gifts, Lara Mahler, founder of [The Privilege Is Mine](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/the-privilege-is-mine-new-york-city-ny-973570), provides some insight. "It depends on how you approach your registry. Too many registries across different sites might feel overwhelming for your guests and they may struggle to keep track, especially older family members or less tech-savvy folks. Also, it can feel cluttered or chaotic for guests if all the items are the same, if there isn't a range in pricing or if you have too many luxury items on your registry. I recommend registering with one or two sites to keep things easy for guests," Mahler, who has nine years of wedding and event planning know-how, says. Avoiding guest overwhelm is one of the reasons why couples love The Knot Registry because we have 14 registry partners that sync directly with our platform.

And even though The Knot Registry has a "Gift Advisor," which tells you how many gifts to add to your registry based on your guest count and breaks it down by price point and gift amount, we want to provide you with specifics for your situation. Keep reading to see where your gift number falls based on guest count and price. 

### How Many Gifts to Register for Based on Guest Count

Mahler says that even if you're planning a small wedding you should offer variety across price points since "guests appreciate choice, especially if some people are buying in pairs." For those in the 51 to 100 guest range, she suggests registering for more gifts than guests so there's flexibility and multiple price tiers. As the guest count increases, you'll need more variation among your gift choices, consider cash funds, physical gifts and options for individuals and groups. You'll also need to include low-cost [wedding registry ideas](https://www.theknot.com/content/best-wedding-registry-ideas) and have only a few big-ticket items. **Quick tip:** Keep the number of guest parties, like couples, in mind because they will likely give a higher-priced gift as opposed to two inexpensive ones.

**Number of Items to Register for Based on Guest Count:**

Keeping the above tips in mind, it's time to start adding gifts. According to Mahler, this is how many items to put on a wedding registry. 

  * **0–50 Guests:** 75–100 
  * **51–100 Guests:** 100–150 
  * **101–150 Guests:** 150–225 
  * **151–200 Guests:** 200–300 
  * **201–300 Guests:** 250–375 
  * **300+ Guests:** 300–450



### How Many Gifts to Register for Based on Price Point

Mahler believes that $0**–** $49 is the most important range because it gives guests affordable options they can give solo or with another guest. "Think: kitchen tools, books, cute home goods, games and towels," she says. Gifts $50 to $99 are the sweet spot to Mahler and she says most people will shop within these wedding registry prices. For this group, add bakeware, bar gadgets, mid-range appliances and home decor to your [wedding registry checklist](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-registry-checklist-essentials). The next level in price is great for "couples, close family members or group gifting. Consider: cookware sets, nice bedding and specialty items," she says. Finally, for the more expensive items, Mahler says this can consist of "luggage, furniture, honeymoon experiences and high-end appliances. Remember, don't overdo it, but don't skip them either."

**Number of Items to Register for Based on Price Point:**

In the end, how many gifts you add is up to you, but having an outline doesn't hurt. Use the following as a guide during your registry building process. 

  * **$0–$49:** 30–60 (approx. 42%)
  * **$50–$99:** 20–45 (approx. 30%)
  * **$100–$149:** 10–25 (approx. 16%)
  * **$150+:** 5–20 (approx. 12%)



## Is It Rude to Put Expensive Items on Your Wedding Registry?

Okay, how expensive is too expensive? For the registry price range, Rhee suggests $25–$300 or more and Mahler says $25–$150 or more. That's not to say you should shy away from expensive items, though. A few big ticket items are okay, since some guests might splurge on a gift or want to contribute to a group gift. If $50 to $200 feels high, don't fret. According to an internal study, the average wedding gift spend was $150, so this range is right on par. Still, as this is a median, it's important to register for gifts at a variety of price points so everyone feels comfortable buying a gift.

## When to Add More Gifts to Your Registry 

Now that you know how many gifts to put on a wedding registry, you're probably wondering when you should add more since it's recommended to continually add gifts to your registry leading up to your big day. "If you notice more people than you thought are buying gifts, don't be afraid to add more as you go. This allows your guests options so they're not limited and you're getting items you actually need," Mahler says. Rhee agrees and adds, "A good rule of thumb is to check in on your registry after major milestones like your engagement party, bridal shower and a few weeks before the wedding." 

**Hot registry tips:** If you make your registry and wedding website through the Knot, you can share your registry on your site. (If you don't know [when to create your registry](https://www.theknot.com/content/when-do-you-register-for-your-wedding), it's around the same time as you make your wedding website since they can go hand in hand.) Also, you can highlight gifts with the "Our Top Choice" options to let guests know your favorites.
