ade our day unique and special. Johnny delivered that plus used his expertise in capturing what he also knew would be heartfelt memories in our video footage. He is very professional and knows intuitively when to step in to guide and direct you to showcase you in the best light balanced with your unique, natural personality. He also has an awesome wit which makes for a positive experience! Johnny and his team are A+. Glad to see the reviews here and on the wedding sites are in line with what After Dark delivers!

I booked Afterdark Media for my wedding. Danny and Johnny were my videographers. These guys are amazing. They are very helpful and professional. I was a nervous wreck since I didn'...

t have a coordinator and they jumped in and helped calm my nerves and reminded me its a day to enjoy. They had very great ideas and they worked very well with my photographers. My photographers even said that they were the best video guys they ever worked with. My photg has been doing this for 20 years. The final highlight was more than I could want. The quality was amazing the shots were amazing. I am so happy I found Afterdark Media. If your a bride reading this review STOP right now and book these guys you will not regret it!

do it! Videographer was the last thing we booked because we weren't sure we really needed it. I am so happy that we did. They were by far the most affordable and very professional....

We got our video within 6 weeks and were so happy with it. Don't skip this service... better to have it than not. Johnny was efficient and quick!

We booked AfterDark Media to create a highlight video for our wedding in Orange County, CA. Johnny was our main contact and videographer for the day. He was very easy to work with ...

and responded quickly to any questions. He is reliable and responsible. Our video was beautiful! We could only afford a single videographer but you could never tell by the great quality of our video. Our friends and family really enjoyed the video and we received many compliments. I definitely recommend AfterDark Media for weddings!

I am so pleased with the value, service and professionalism AfterDark provided to us for our wedding! I had an immediate connection with Johnny when I talked to him on the phone. I...

knew almost immediately that I wanted them to be our videographer for our wedding. We were trying to fit video into our budget and really appreciate Johnny and Danny working with us so that we could have this amazing video proof of our wedding! We got the highlight video and the raw footage and could not be happier. They were so great at communicating with us and we actually never met with them before the wedding. We talked on the phone, skyped and emailed and that was enough. On the day of, they had so many great ideas and I was so impressed with their professionalism. They were very present but not in the way. They worked great with our photographer. They were just spectacular! They went above and beyond anything I could have asked for. I loved working with them. The finished product is absolutely delightful! They listened to all the things I liked and disliked and got everything right. They knew that I was interested in getting some interviews of guests (even though it is usually an extra cost), wanted our vows and wanted our dog in it. They also used the songs in the highlight video that I wanted. Everyone loves our beautiful highlight video. They captured the spirit of our day and got all the right elements. For our raw footage, they even cut the footage so that we have the ceremony, the speeches, and dances separate. Also the interviews are also separate which we really appreciated. I love that the highlighted video came on beautiful DVDs with our image on them and we got a Vimeo link that we can share with family and friends. I cannot say enough great things about AfterDark. Johnny and Danny are so committed and talented. They are a great vendor to work with and I would recommend them for your videography needs wholeheartedly.

ay that is so wonderful and touching and captures all that we felt and experienced. They met with us before the event to get a feel of what we were about and they definitely captured that essence. Almost everyone that watches it has commented on how the video expresses our love and special relationship (and most thank us for the cry!). Additionally, many of the guests have commented on how great they were. We couldn't have been more pleased both with the video and the experience of working with After Dark Media!

xcellent value for money and you'd be wasting money paying at least double from many of the other companies we received quotes from. They are professional, friendly and very easy to work with and captured our special day perfectly. Friends and family who were unable to attend have had nothing but great things to say about the video. If you are planning a wedding on any budget please contact AfterDark Media, u will be very glad u did and your budget will be too!
