There's much ado made about the wedding dress (and rightfully so), but it's the accessories—and in particular, the veil—that truly complete a bridal ensemble. The veil sets the romantic tone for the wedding ceremony, but do brides wear veils during the reception?

"Traditionally, the veil is worn during the ceremony as a symbol of romance, elegance and modesty," explains Kate Blackwell, a bridal stylist and the founder of [Something White Styling](https://www.somethingwhitestyling.com/). "Most brides remove it after walking back down the aisle; this avoids damage and gives you more freedom for the next event."

This is where [veil tradition](https://www.theknot.com/content/does-the-veil-have-to-cover-my-face) diverges, however, as today's brides are getting creative with their [modern veils](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-veil-trends), swapping them for shorter ones at the reception, bustling them and more. Here, we dive into the best moments to wear your veil and when to remove your veil at the wedding.

## Do Brides Wear Veils During the Reception?

If you [choose to wear a wedding veil](https://www.theknot.com/content/is-veil-on-wedding-day-necessary), it is most traditionally worn during the ceremony and not the reception—but as with anything in weddings, there are exceptions to the rule, and brides are free to make a personal decision about when to wear and remove their veil. 

Though the veil is typically removed for the reception, especially the dancing portion, "you may keep it on for a grand entrance, especially with a shorter veil," Blackwell says. And, "if the bride absolutely loves the look of her veil, I say yes [to keeping it on]! At the end of the day, every bride should wear what makes them happy and feel their absolute best, but I still recommend a shorter veil for anything postceremony. Maybe opt for a veil change to get a fresh look!"

As for _how_ to remove it? "Veils that are attached with a comb and placed into slightly teased hair tend to stay better," Blackwell explains. "For taking it off, I always suggest having your hairstylist nearby to assist, so that if any hairs come loose—which they usually do, and that's okay—they can quickly fix it."

## When to Take Off the Veil at a Wedding

Though there are traditional moments to wear, lift or remove a veil, many depend on the [veil style](https://www.theknot.com/content/beautiful-wedding-veil-styles). "The length of the veil can definitely play a role in when a bride removes it or if she keeps it on," Blackwell says. "Shorter to mid-length veils can typically stay on longer, whereas anything that is sweeping the floor or longer than the train of the gown should be removed after the ceremony to avoid being damaged or stepped on, since veils are quite delicate."

### When to Lift Veil

If your veil has a blusher—that is, a section that hangs over your face—it's typically worn for part of the ceremony and then lifted with the rest of the veil still attached. So, when do you lift the veil in a wedding? "There are multiple options," Blackwell says. "The most traditional is when the bride's father lifts the blusher before giving the bride away; this is done at the start of the ceremony when the bride reaches the altar." Another option is leaving the veil over your face for most of the ceremony, and having your partner lift it before the first kiss. ("I think this is so romantic and symbolic; it reveals the bride right before vows or the kiss," Blackwell says.) And finally, the bride can lift the veil herself before exchanging vows. "This is a more empowered and modern approach, especially for brides walking themselves down the aisle."

### When to Remove Veil

When to take off the veil at a wedding is mostly a personal choice, with tradition guiding a few key moments. Here, Blackwell weighs in on the most common times to remove the veil. 

  * **For photos:** Wedding portraits—taken before the ceremony, after the ceremony or during the first look—should be taken both with and without the veil. "I love the drama and movement a veil adds to portraits," Blackwell says. "Having a veil for some shots and then off for others is the way to go."
  * **After the ceremony:** Traditionally, a bride removes her veil after the ceremony so it doesn't get stepped on or damaged during cocktail hour. That said, if there's a headpiece that goes with the look, she can leave it on. "Any headpiece that is separate from the veil does not have to get removed when the veil comes off, unless it doesn't stand on its own very well," Blackwell says. "Certain headpieces look better paired with the veil and should be removed at the same time, but it really depends on the style."
  * **Before the reception or dancing:** "Especially if you're wearing a long veil, it's practical to remove it before dancing or mingling," Blackwell says. In this case, the bride can make her grand entrance in the veil and then remove it right after. The exception? Short veils—think fingertip length or shorter—can remain on if preferred.
  * **For the after-party:** "I definitely recommend that my brides ditch the veil and change into a new party outfit!" Blackwell says. The [reception dress](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-dress-reception-dresses) is all about letting loose and having fun with fashion; a veil here may seem too buttoned-up.
