It was a true pleasure to work with Tina throughout the year + long process of planning our wedding. Over the many phone calls, site visits, texts and emails - Tina was patient, ki...

nd, creative and just exuded CALM throughout everything. We had an atypical event spread out over multiple days at a private family residence, and Tina was game for everything. It really felt like we gained a friend in this process and I'll miss our regular check ins! Leading up to our event, she kept us organized with regular phone calls and to-do lists, and she would gently follow up or ask if we needed help if we fell behind on our tasks. She is detail oriented and very organized. During the event, Tina and Karen were both truly angels. They did SO much and I'm sure I didn't even see half of it. Whether it was checking in on how we were feeling during the day, to making sure we had food and drinks to carrying my purse and phone around and making sure our families felt loved and included to all the vendor organizing and tip handing out - they were the true MVPs. Tina even snuck away to clean up a wine bottle that we accidentally smashed inside when a bag broke as we were heading off to our first dance. Tina is proactive and because she spends so much time getting to know you during the planning process, she is able to anticipate what you might need or how she can best help, which is really just the best sort of support you can ask for generally, let alone during your wedding. We can't recommend working with Oh Splendid Day enough and we will be forever grateful for their help and guidance in facilitating one of the most special weeks of our lives.

As I sit down to write this, I am certain nothing I say will do justice to the level of service and kindness Tina delivers. Her attention to detail, desire to please, knowledge of ...

our venue and local vendors, she was nothing short of absolute perfection. A few weeks from our wedding date, I emailed Tina that I had a MOH issue and immediately Tina asked if I needed to have a call with her - at 10:30pm! She gave our DJ and his wife her personal babysitter so that they could both attend and enjoy the wedding. She helped with directing me to a local salon since we live out of town and she even hand wrote our dessert signs when I forgot them.... and she does it all with a smile! Tina is the epitome of above and beyond; she is always available, responsive, communicative and so calm!!!! She is direct, but thoughtful and so intentional. She had countless suggestions on how to reuse things (flowers, signs, furniture etc.) and was always looking out for our best interest. Her experience shows in everything she does, right down to her pep talk right before you walk down the aisle! She made our day a fairytale... and the best part was, she made it so easy that we were truly able to enjoy every single second. We had ZERO stress. You will not regret working with Tina, she's an absolute rockstar and you can feel how much she loves what she does.

There are not enough words to describe the love we have for Tina and Oh Splendid Day, but I will try to express it in this review. Tina was recommended to us by our venue, Olympia'...

s Valley Estate in Petaluma, CA. I always knew I was a bride who would really want a wedding planner when it came time to plan my dream day. Shortly after my husband and I got engaged, my mom got sick and that changed the wedding planner topic into not just a want, but a need. I needed someone who could help give this day the attention that I wanted to give it, but might not always have had the time to due to my mom's illness. We met Tina in May of 2021, with the hopes for a wedding in August of 2022. I thought we would have plenty of time to get all the big and small details together while also allowing my mom time to heal so our wedding day would be everything my husband and I dreamed of. Tina was so good about routinely checking in and assigning tasks to keep planning moving along, recommended wonderful vendors who matched our style, budget, and vision, and gave endless helpful tips and tricks for planning and also enjoying our wedding and the whole process that accompanies it. We got to know Tina as a friend through this process, which made planning a wedding anything but stressful. In January of 2022, our lives took a difficult and unexpected turn. My mom's illness progressed and it was becoming clear that August was not an attainable goal for having my mom at our wedding. Being the first of her children to get married, and knowing that she had so looked forward to such a wonderful celebration with all her loved ones, we knew that we had to move our wedding. I called Tina on a Saturday afternoon to explain to her the circumstances and to ask her if there was any possible way we could get married the following Saturday. This superhero of a woman and her sidekick Karen coordinated and carried out a 140 person wedding in 6 days, and the day could not have run more smoothly or been more perfect. From flowers to rentals to catering to entertainment, we had everything we could have asked for and more. If you had ever told me that we would have 1 week to plan and throw our dream wedding, I would have told you that was impossible. And without Tina, it would have been. But Tina did not only make our wedding possible, she made it perfect. With an endless amount of grace, kindness, patience, and smiles, she made the whole process enjoyable and memorable. She ensured that my mom was taken care of and comfortable throughout the day. She ensured that all of the wonderful vendors felt supported. She ensured that I did not feel an ounce of the stress a bride always feels leading up to and on her wedding day. And most importantly of all, Tina made my husband and I feel so special. She ensured we felt like the bride and groom, and that the day felt like our wedding, regardless of the circumstances. We will never forget Tina and the absolute light she was throughout the entire wedding planning process, even though it went very differently than we planned. We gained a friend through it all, and in such a difficult time in our lives, we were able to celebrate a very special love with all of our favorite people in the most perfect way thanks to Tina and Oh Splendid Day!

We hired Tina for our wedding back in May 2020 for our wedding that was supposed to take place May 2021, and though our plans shift tremendously, like many other couples in 2020, T...

ina has been nothing short of amazing. While we ultimately ended up postponing our celebration indefinitely, Tina was such a help in the planning process from very early on and throughout the process of deciding how to move forward through covid. Initially, she helped me talk through what we wanted, potential partners to hire, and made so many great suggestions. Having her on my side made me feel confident in all of my decisions and like I had the best of the best advice. She has truly helped me make some of the biggest and scariest decisions with her experience and knowledge, has really terrific communication skills by checking in frequently and just offering her time to bounce ideas off, and always makes herself available, even on short notice when she can. I will without a doubt utilize Tina's services again in the future and highly recommend her services!

I sincerely think that hiring Tina to coordinate our wedding was like destiny. She was the best decision that we made about our wedding, and hands down, I could not have made it ha...

ppen without her. She handled every decision that I could not, eased my anxiety when things got crazy, and truly made me think that I was her only client. Tina always responded to texts, emails, calls, and kept me on track with all the little details that planning a wedding entails. She literally goes above and beyond for her clients. At the end of it all, she has become more like family and we've already agreed that she will be planning every major life event we have!

r venue, OVE (who we also LOVE)!! She's extremely personable, friendly, sweet, respectful, honest, easy to work with and extremely detail oriented (which I loved!) She was our "day-of" wedding coordinator, but was always so open to any questions, feedback, & help along the way before our official start date! To say she is amazing - is a major understatement! Attention all Brides (& grooms): do yourself a favor and hire Tina! She will make your entire planning process so fun and you'll enjoy every second of it and not be overwhelmed or stressed. She is the absolute BEST. I felt completely at ease on our wedding day just knowing she was there, I knew all my guests were in great hands and everything would be taken care of perfectly. Tina, you're amazing! We feel so grateful to have gotten to work with you! Thank you for being there and bringing your wonderful energy to our wedding! :-)

Tina was absolutely amazing in every way. Going into the whole wedding planning phase was definitely a little nerve-wracking for me, but as soon as I met Tina, I knew we'd be in g...

ood hands. She was our "day-of" wedding coordinator, but she went way above and beyond that. From the beginning, she was there to answer any questions we had, calm any worries we had, and she was so organized and on the ball. On the wedding day, she made sure everything looked absolutely perfect! I'm a little bit of a control freak and the kind of person that likes to do everything herself, but thankfully I was able to really let go and trust Tina and let her do her thing, and everything turned out even better than I'd expected it. I was amazed when I walked down the aisle to see how beautiful everything was set up, and how well thought out everything Tina had done was. The same went for the reception site - it was absolutely gorgeous. I would recommend Oh Splendid Day to absolutely anyone. She was the best! I wish I could do the whole day over again, it was so fantastic! Thank you Tina, you really made our day!

Hey guys! I'm here to share a little bit about my experience with Oh Splendid Day. I got married this past August in a beautiful round barn where I had the absolute pleasure of wor...

king with Tina. Tina is the exemplary model of absolute professionalism. Tina will help you with establishing your budget, suggesting venue locations, decor options and truly much more. Tina coordinates with all vendors through this planning process and creates a timeline for the day of. The bride and groom are only responsible for showing up on their big day while all other responsibilities including unforeseen ones are handled by Tina. She facilitates the set up and breakdown of all seating arrangements, decorations, and table place settings. She did an amazing job of having a firm but kind hand in terms of keeping the wedding party "on schedule" as far as planned activities like first dance and the boquete toss. Overall I would use Tina in the future for any events as she is professional, kind, witty, and quick to think on her feet. Haven't convinced you yet? Last thing that I really would like to emphasize about Oh Splendid Day! and Tina; the level of integrity she gives to her job. I felt safe, secure, and confident everything would go smoothly on my big day. A trust worthy and excellent wedding coordinator that I would implicitly recommend to anyone. \- A Happy Bride

Tina is amazing. She far exceeded all of our expectations and our expectations were pretty high  I phoned Tina while my daughter, her fiancé and I were at a Wedding Expo feeli...

ng very overwhelmed and totally lost, not knowing where to even start. I told her on the phone that my daughter wanted an outdoor wedding in a redwood setting but not a barn. We met a half hour later and she had three perfect options for us. All of which were perfect and exactly what they were looking for. We hired her on the spot. BEST move ever. From there she guided us through every single step of planning the wedding, responding to every single text and email, right away. I am divorced from my daughter’s father so she had to deal with some family dynamics, in which she was extremely professional and patient. And just kept things calm. We had a limited budget and less than six months to plan the entire wedding. Tina made it work. Helped us work with vendors to come in on budget. Tina helped us every step of the way but her services the day of the wedding were invaluable. She kept us on track, made sure that all of Bride and Grooms wants and needs for her special day were covered with ZERO stress. We were all able to enjoy this very special occasion with no concerns or any responsibilities. It went a long way to make the wedding and reception feel very intimate and special as all the families and guest could just focus on the day. I tend to worry about everything, especially on such an important occasion, but as soon as I met Tina, I was able to relax and enjoy the process as I immediately had 100% trust in her ability to make the day perfect. I feel we were so lucky to have found her. I know with 100% certainty that we could not have done it without Tina’s. I can’t even find the words to say how impressed we all were with her. I would HIGHLY recommend that you hire her for your special day. I promise you will be thanking me later and will write an equally glowing review.

Tina did an amazing job on the day of the wedding. She is incredibly responsive with every email and phone request I made seeking advise or updating her on any changes. On the day ...

of the wedding she showed up early to my hair appointment to check in with me. At the venue she managed all our vendors and had the place looking amazing when all the guests arrived. Throughout the whole day she continued to check in and helped us stay on schedule with everything we wanted to do on the wedding day. We were so lucky to have her on our wedding day. I don't think the day would have been nearly as enjoyable or organized without her. I would highly recommend Tina as a wonderful Day of Coordinator.
