I can not say enough wonderful things about my experience at Mira Couture. I was lucky enough to have Addie assist me in finding the most stunning wedding dress that made me feel ...

incredible. Addie, not only was super sweet and fun, but she is hands down a rock star at her job. I was joined by friends and family and they are still raving about how fantastic Addie was. The salon itself is smaller but so warm and intimate. I could not be happier to be a Mira Bride! Thanks Addie!

I had a really great experience at Mira every time I went in. The first time, my consultant Christy was great and helped me find the perfect dress!! The second time was when my dr...

ess came in and again everything was just perfect. We had such a great experience that we actually went back to get my mom's dress and our flower girl's dress. No one was in the store that day, so we had the place all to ourselves. It was so much fun! The only thing that I was a little sad about (and I'm really stretching here lol) is that Mira's is known for posting pictures of brides to be either finding their dress or picking it up on their social media. Unfortunately I didn't make the cut. haha! Overall though, it was a wonderful experience!

My experience with Mira Bridal Couture was amazing! My wedding was November 18, 2017. I wanted to save my reviews for my vendors after my big day, so I could look back at it all a...

fter the event. I was engaged back in June of 2016 and was trying to solidify a wedding date for many many months. We went through so many different changes in venues and dates... My first experience with Mira Bridal was when we were aiming for a February 2017 wedding. I had gone to many bridal shops/boutiques in the area and could not find a dress that amazed me. I visited Bianca's and was treated poorly due to my wedding date and how close it was. The ladies there immediately said how it was nearly impossible to order a dress in time and to just browse the dresses they had in stock in my size. They were nice about it, but I didn't like the fact they reacted so negatively. I tried looking around their store, but didn't find any that I felt was right for me. My friend and I were browsing the downtown area, when we spotted Mira Bridal Couture. We thought, why not go inside and see what it's like. Anything with couture in the name translates to extremely expensive in my mind, so I went in with low expectations of me being able to afford a dress. The lady at the desk was extremely helpful and understanding. I told her about how I didn't expect to get a dress on time, yadda yadda, but she always held a smile and explained how it was not an issue and to schedule an appointment (even after knowing my February deadline). I figured, why not? Get the full bridal experience. Dawn was my specialist on the day of my appointment and she made me feel so relaxed and calm. I was worried about trying on dresses and not committing, but she eased me into the process and everything went smoothly. I didn't feel pressured at all! I showed her some dresses that I liked (pages that I printed out) and she pulled out some dresses that fit my desired style and a few that were close to it, but also different. I'm so glad she went outside of my desired look, because I ended up falling for a dress that wasn't a part of my intended style. She had a great eye and listened to my feedback on every dress - what I liked, what I didn't like - and adapted to each dress I tried on. I'm a very indecisive person, but just by my body language she knew which one I loved. With my parents and my best friend at my side, they all knew which one was the perfect fit just by seeing the smile I had while wearing THE dress. I was surprised I found a dress that wasn't too expensive, fit my budget, was beautiful, and one that looked amazing on me on my very first appointment! Dawn was truly amazing! That appointment was 9/22/2016. Dawn explained how there was a shipment of Essense of Australia coming in during the month of January and my dress would be in on time. I was incredibly happy! Everything worked out and the dress did arrive within that month. I wasn't treated with skepticism over my wedding date, but with understanding and kindness. Even though we changed our date to later in the year, the dress would have arrived on time for our intended late February wedding. All I can say is thank you Dawn for your charm and professionalism. You treated me and my family with respect and true hospitality. Thank you Mira Bridal for my beautiful dress. I received many many compliments regarding my dress from my family, friends, and (now) husband. Thank you! Dress: Essense of Australia D2186 ZPSD Size: 8ZP

DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT GO HERE!!!!!!! At first Cheryl was very nice, she put me in a dress I wasn't thrilled with until she grabbed a belt and I fell in love with the dress. I was ...

so excited to receive it and when they called a month early saying it was here I was jumping with joy to put it back on. My belt took a little longer than expected so I waited till it came in. I made the appointment to try it on again and invited my parents and my mother in law who were excited to see my dress. Cheryl helps me in my dress pulls out the belt and it’s the wrong color. I tell her it's the wrong color and she responds with "o no, it's right we ordered the ivory to match the dress" I said that we ordered the other to match my guys vests. She kept denying it, so I went home and got my receipt which clearly says cashmere, the right color. So we call and the other lady who works with her goes omg I'm so sorry it happens a lot from the company we will fix that in the morning! So I'm happy, I call in the morning to see if it was ordered, no Cheryl doesn't get in till 12, and she calls me at two and asks for pictures of the belt and the tag to send to the company to get another belt. I do it right away and then she calls and offers me the floor belt that has been on countless brides and has a snag in exchange the brand new one I paid $300+ for. My parents go down there to fix it and have it ordered and Cheryl denies that she said that she said she ordered the ivory. She then blames the company again. My dad said I was there and she’s rolling her eyes and being rude along with the bigger black lady who works there. They then say that without the belt that can't order a new one at around closing so my parent have to go back in the morning to return it, at which they say, O well we'll take care it later. This ruined my wedding dress experience.

This review is geared towards the fact my dress arrived 3 weeks before my wedding when they said it would arrive a month prior and the lack of customer service in this business. I...

ordered my dress through Mira Bridal on October 22nd. I received a phone call in late November saying my dress would be shipped middle of March and it takes 7-10 business days to arrive at the store. Upon hearing this I was already nervous as this only allowed a month for alterations to be completed. I called the alterations business that Mira Bridal refers guests to and they said they need at least 10 weeks for bridal alterations and I would only be able to give them 4 (if my dress actually showed up on time). I later received an email providing very little info about my dress stating it will ready for pick up on or after March 16th. March 16th came and went with no word from Mira’s Bridal. I finally called on March 30th since that was 10 business days from the expected shipping date. They kept stringing me along saying it should arrive any day now and that they are expecting it Friday or Monday. Monday came and went again with no word from Mira Bridal. I called every single day the week of April 3rd to follow up as they were not calling me back. I asked multiple times for a tracking number so I wouldn’t have to keep calling them for an update and could easily check the status of where the dress was. They were unable to provide me a tracking number even though they said they would get me one, and then again pushed the arrival date back 2 more times during this week’s conversations with me. This causing more and more stress as my wedding is getting closer and closer, and again I am still trying to allow time for alterations. I was more upset about the fact that they said it would take 2 weeks for my dress to arrive after the ship date and in reality it took a month – with me continually following up with them and not receiving any phone calls from them to update me. I called again on Monday, April 10th at 3:00pm to check the status and Mira Bridal said they received confirmation that my dress would be coming in the next day, yet they did not call me and I again had to contact them. Since the communication with this store is so one sided and they know I am getting anxious and upset I would expect some effort or phone call from the store to help ease the stress, or at least help me. I am so thankful I chose to pick a different retailer for my bridesmaid dresses because if I was having this same issue with ALL the dresses for my wedding, it would not have been a pretty sight. I would not recommend a bride to order their wedding dress through this business solely on the fact that I was continually strung me along and let me down multiple times and provided little to no information on when my wedding dress would actually arrive. This caused so much unwanted stress during the final month of wedding planning and put a huge damper on the whole experience towards the end. I sadly wasn’t even excited on the day I finally got my dress because I honestly wasn’t sure if it would really be coming with how many times I had been lied to. This also lead to stress of getting my dress altered in the short time frame. Even the alternations business said I was lucky to have gotten an appointment as they are pretty booked up. I finally had my dress in hand and completed 3 days before my wedding.

Dress shopping was such a wonderful experience at Mira Bridal Couture. I had the pleasure of working with Dawn. Her joy and excitement put me at ease, and made the entire experien...

ce delightful for myself as well as the group I had brought with me. I only needed to try on one dress before knowing it was the dress of my dreams. I remember trying it on, stepping out with excitement from the fitting room to show my entourage, then looking at myself in the mirror, and I couldn’t help but shed a few tears because I was so happy and felt so beautiful in it. I instantly said YES to the dress, then took photos…admired myself some more in the mirror…and didn’t want to take the dress off! Overtime I finally went back into the fitting room and filled out my contract to order the dress. I was shocked to find out that such a gorgeous dress was so reasonably priced! Initially when I was checked into the appointment, I was asked about a budget and replied without having a price cap. I by no means have a limitless budget but for special occasions I feel that one should not be limited, so it’s OK to splurge. To my luck and advantage, Mira Bridal Couture was priced reasonably, while having top-notch brands, and excellent customer service. I highly recommend this exquisite boutique and more then ever I recommend my lovely consultant Dawn. She really goes above and beyond with her customer service and is truly genuine. Thank you Dawn & Mira Bridal Couture!!

I purchased my dress at Mira Oct. '15 after trying on dresses at another boutique. I called 1-2 months in advance to set up my appointment and provided specifics for what I was loo...

king for in a gown. The day I arrived, the Mira's employee helping me only pulled 1 dress and it was nothing like I'd described. My family and friends proceeded to help by pulling things off the rack they thought I might like while she stood aside. When asking questions about the dresses, it was very clear the girl assisting was new and had NO idea what she was talking about. The royalty-like service I'd received at the previous boutique left much to be desired at Miras. That being said, the quality of the dresses were great, their preferred alterations lady is fantastic, dealing with the manager during checkout was convenient, and I found my dream dress! Just wish the process had gone a little smoother and more professional.

I met Mira, the owner of Mira Bridal Couture in 2009 when I began modeling for her shop. I always dreamed of the day when I would become a real bride (as opposed to a model bride) ...

and I always knew I would purchase my dream wedding dress from this amazing bridal shop! I didn't look anywhere else, because I knew Mira's would have exactly what I've dreamt of since I was a young girl. The staff was very patient with me & with my entourage (bridesmaids, MOH, MOB, MOG) I tried on 9 different dresses and it was so hard to decide which one I wanted, but what the determining factor in my final decision was the dress that made me cry (happy tears) when I tried it on. Mira Bridal Couture is a very elegant bridal shop and has a calming and relaxing feel and beautiful decor. I am so pleased with my decision and I recommend this place to everybody I know who gets engaged! Thank you Mira & Staff!

Mira Bridal was my third bridal salon appointment. I had been to two other salons within the previous 24 hours and it had been a whirlwind of dresses. I walked into Mira's and was ...

immediately treated like royalty. My consultant, Dawn, was incredibly sweet and so helpful. We pulled about 20 gowns (one of them was a gown I had liked at another salon, for comparison) and then I got to dress down into a comfy robe and sip on a glass of champagne while I waited to try on the first wedding dress. I think I only got to dress #15 before I found the one. I walked out in the dress and my dad said, "That's it, we're done," and I knew it was perfect. The whole day was like a dream come true.

Mira Bridal Couture was always where I wanted to buy my dress, there was no need to go anywhere else because the help I received that day from Mira and Staff was truly phenomenal. Not only did I buy my gown there, but I also bought my bridesmaids dresses and got all men's and little boys suits there as well! I was able to go to one place and style my entire wedding party! When your a new bride, it felt so good to feel so organized. They stayed on top of my wedding party insuring everything was taken care of and in on time. I would recommend Mira Bridal Couture to anyone!

As excited as I was to be engaged and marrying the man of my dreams... I was not extremely excited to begin trying on wedding dresses. I can be SO picky and when I get an idea in ...

my head I (most of the time) just can't budge from that idea. And since I am a girl... I had a VERY good idea of what I wanted and knew would not settle for unless it was found. However, I'm not real big on taking the time to find it. Long story short my experience at Mira's was absolutely fantastic! Feeling overwhelmed with decision making before I even walked through the door, the tone that was set was once in the store was exactly what I needed. I was approached in a way that was cool, calm and collected and I just got to talk about my vision. Once I was finish describing, they said that they were pretty sure they had the perfect dress in mind for me. Suggesting I still browse through some dresses on my own, I picked what I thought I would like while they collected the dress that I would be choosing to wear on my wedding day. The first dress Mira's suggested was THE dress. I don't know how they did it but they made the process as easy as possible for me and feel greatly appreciative for that. My dress was perfect on the wedding day and my dress was everything I could dream it to be. Thank you Mira's for such a positive experience!

I stopped by this place on the day after Thanksgiving last year. I had another appointment scheduled for Bianca's bridal shop afterward because I was planning to purchase a dress I...

had tried on in September. When I got to Mira's I ended up finding a dress so similar to the one I planned to buy and it looked so amazing on and had all the things I was going without (like sparkle) on the other dress, I just couldn't believe it and bought the dress. It was kinda funny though, one of the sales ladies walked by me as I was trying on the dress in front of the mirror and told me how beautiful I was, then she asked if I was going to cry and was I going to say yes to the dress. lol I didn't even cry at my wedding, I think she would have been even more disappointed. Anyway, definitely recommend checking this place out, especially when they are having sales! Their bridesmaid dresses were gorgeous but out of our budget so had to pass those up.

I had initially purchased a dress at the local David's Bridal and had been quite disappointed in my experience there. On a whim, I made an appointment at Mira's Bridal Couture and...

absolutely fell in love. Not only was the shop just beautiful and elegant, the level of customer service I experienced was exemplary. Dawn was a wonder. Not only did I end up purchasing a new (and way better!) dress there and returning the DB dress, I was able to get my future husband and his entire groomsmen party their tuxedos at the best price in town. I can't speak highly enough of Mira's. It is exactly what any bride hopes to have as part of their wedding journey.

9/07/2011 • Ashley C

I wanted something very different and I wasn't finding different anywhere, until I went to Mira's. Dawn was my consultant and after telling her what I was looking for she found the...

dress I was looking for. To set the stage, I wanted different, I am budget oriented, matter-of-fact, and was not going to cry when finding a dress. My mother and I saw the dress before I tried it on and confirmed the price. I was not going to try on a dress that I couldn't afford. We were thrilled when it was in the price range. I knew that I wanted a sweetheart neckline so I even got a price quote to make sure that I could afford it since it was a straight across neckline. I didn't buy the dress right away because I wasn't 100% sold on it, and I wanted my dad's approval. A week later I come in with my Dad, he likes it so we are going to put the order in. I confirmed that the designer didn't have the option of making it a sweetheart neckline during manufacturing and no such luck, but I was going to get it anyway. You pay 1/2 then, and the remaining balance when you pick up the dress. When we were told the price I was very upset, because after all the talk about our budget and how important it was, when we were being rung up it was $1,000 over our budget, and over the quoted price. Well, I said I didn't need the dress and I was on my way out the door when my parents said not so fast. We had a verbal contract as to what the price was, it was on a piece of paper, and my parents really wanted me to have the dress. Dawn really wanted me to have the dress. So after some discussion I got the dress for the original quoted price. I thought that would be the end of it. The next day my mom got a phone call from Dawn telling her that she made a mistake and that we needed to pay the higher price. I was done at this point and I just wanted to find another dress, because it is just a dress, and i was not going to pay $1,000 more. We had a receipt, which is a contract. I understand mistakes happen, and I'm a very forgiving person, but money doesn't grow on trees. My mom is a rockstar because after tactfully speaking with Mira as a business woman, Mira finally admitted that it was Dawn's mistake, and Mira needed to handle it on her side of the transaction. It was not our duty to fork over the money. After a few months I call Mira's because I'm thinking my dress should be in, but i haven't heard anything. Well it is! So I make an apt with the receptionist. The next day I get a rather harassing voicemail from Mira's telling me in needed to come in the next day (not the day of my apt) because my dress has been at the store for almost a month and it's taking up space! Well thank you for calling me to let me know! I had to call them. So basically I had to call my family, tell them they couldn't come to my apt to see my dress anymore, but that I needed to pick it up the next day. I live an hour and 15 min from Modesto. Luckily for me I am self employed, but if I weren't what were they going to do with my dress? Throw it out or send it back? I think not, so they didn't need to be so rude. I picked up my dress and ran out of the store. I go to a bridal salon in my home town to do the alterations and here is the kicker, the designer does do custom orders during manufacturing. They actually specialize in it! So I could have had a sweetheart neckline in the first place for MUCH cheaper! In the end it looked great but what a HEADACHE!

Thanks to Mira Bridal Couture, I felt the most beautiful possible on my wedding day, August 28, 2010. I purchased a fit-and-flare wedding gown by La Sposa by Pronovias about 9 mont...

hs before my wedding. Mira, the owner, had been my consultant, and she listened to my vision of the perfect wedding gown, and in no time at all, she brought the dress of my dreams to me! I picked the first of seven or so dresses I had tried on there. She also helped me pick the perfect veil! A couple weeks later, with the help of Jenna and Dawn, two other consultants there, I also found the perfect headpiece, earrings, necklace, and shoes to go with the perfect gown! They all made the experience so easy and memorable. I have never felt like a princess before, but thanks to Mira Bridal Couture, I felt like I was floating along in a fairytale on my wedding day!
