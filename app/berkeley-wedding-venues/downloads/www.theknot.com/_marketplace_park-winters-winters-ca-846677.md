Additionally, the dinner and appetizers served were phenomenal — everything was beautifully presented, tasted amazing, and our guests couldn’t stop talking about how delicious everything was. They continued to share it was the best meal they’ve ever eaten at a wedding! Park Winters truly offers the best of everything — a stunning location, exceptional service and staff, as well as an unforgettable dining experience.

rtin, we knew we were in good hands. The communication, professionalism, and genuine care he showed throughout the planning process made a huge difference. We were also lucky enough to work with Pieper Nakanishi, the event coordinator Park Winters provided us, and she was also incredible. She kept everything organized, calm, and on track , we didn’t have to stress about a thing on the big day. The event flowed beautifully, and it’s clear the staff here really knows how to pull off a seamless wedding. The food was amazing (our guests are still raving about it), the staff were friendly and attentive, and the venue itself is simply stunning. Every single guest we’ve talked to since has told us how beautiful the day was and how it was one of the best weddings they’ve ever been to. Park Winters made our wedding unforgettable. We couldn’t be more grateful. Highly recommend!

We fell in love with Park Winters from the first time we stepped foot on the property. It's clear that John and Rafael have poured the entire soul into creating a world-class venue...

with gardens that create a fairy-tale like atmosphere. Beyond the beauty, the fact that they prepare all of the food on site and take care of the things that many venues don't (i.e., tables, place settings, etc), was a huge selling point for us. Pieper was an incredible help in guiding us through the process of planning our big day. Everything was executed to plan and our guests raved about the food, venue, and overall atmosphere of the wedding. We also really appreciated that Park Winters is truly ADA and even our our mobility-impaired guests got to enjoy every moment of our big day. They were also amazing about handling dietary restrictions! I'd recommend Park Winters to anyone looking to get married!

our wedding guests gave huge compliments to the venue. The venue was spacious and was perfect for our guests, some who preferred chatting and exploring, as well as those who preferred dancing. Pieper and Angelena, the venue reps, were complete professionals in giving us advice during our site walk and throughout the planning process. The venue's kitchen and waitstaff were also wonderful. Our food was delicious, and there were plenty of options for our guests with dietary restrictions. Even my family, who can be hard to please, gave compliments to the food. My husband and I also give rave reviews on our overnight stay and next-day breakfast at the Inn. Eva, who hosted us at the Inn, was professional, caring, and gave us plenty of privacy. The breakfast was delicious and thoughtfully prepared. This was an amazing blessing after our big day (of drinking haha) and was the perfect start to our new married life. We love Park Winters and definitely hope to return for our milestone anniversaries in the future.

Park Winters was a DREAM wedding venue and I'm so glad to be able to say we had our wedding there. The team was so helpful, responsive, and accommodating with all of our questions ...

and needs. The atmosphere is what really sold us on Park Winters as a wedding venue. The home, garden, and barn spaces were perfect for what we needed and because of the spaces natural beauty, we didn't need to do much in terms of wedding decor, aside from florals. We catered dinner with the in house caterers and our guests RAVED about the food. Park Winters made our wedding day so special and I couldn't have picked a more perfect wedding venue!

messaged to figured out where this stunning venue was! My now husband and I visited Park Winters for an anniversary weekend before we were even engaged, and we knew in our hearts this was our wedding venue. It was even the biggest atmospheric river storm in a century when we visited, and we still knew it was the place for us! Park Winters and their entire team is the best of the best, from John who was our initial liaison for booking our date at Park Winters, to Pieper who oversaw every detail of our wedding day with our planner, Hannah, to the catering staff, and friendly folks in the Inn, this team is dedicated to exceptionalism. The food in particular had our guests talking for weeks after our wedding! Everyone raved, seriously raved, about the fantastic appetizers, meals, and drinks served at our wedding. I know there was so much work in the background for our wedding, but we would have never known it! Everything was so seamless, and a well oiled machine. Park Winters took the stress out of wedding, making sure everything was executed exactly as we visioned. We would get married at Park Winters again and again and can’t wait to visit soon for another one of their exceptional farm experiences. Thank you John, Pieper, and the entire Park Winters team for executing the wedding of our dreams!

After booking the venue, Pieper was assigned to us as our event coordinator and she was such a pleasure to work with from day 1. She was extremely easy to get a hold of at any point in the wedding planning process. She always answered our questions quickly and enthusiastically. With the many questions that come with wedding planning, she never made us feel like we were a bother. The day of the wedding went so smoothly. All of the staff at Park Winters were so professional, kind, welcoming and a pleasure to work with. The buffet dinner was outstanding, the food is incredible here! It is farm to table and is so delicious. The drinks were top notch. We got many comments from our guests on how friendly the staff was, how delicious the food and drink was and what a beautiful properly Park Winters is. Park Winters is a STUNNING venue. The grounds are beautifully kept and there are so many great spots to have your ceremony and to take photographs. We were blown away how gorgeous our wedding was. Our wedding felt like an absolute dream. We stayed at Park Winters the night of our wedding and the following morning we were treated to a delicious, homemade breakfast spread which was the perfect way to end our wedding weekend. We could not recommend Park Winters more for your perfect start to forever!

I visited a LOT of venues all around Sonoma, Napa, Yolo, and Marin counties. Park Winters was the clear winner for me, and I am so glad I trusted my gut! Because they include food ...

in their pricing, it’s a little tricky to exactly comparing pricing with other venues, but by my calculations, Park Winters is such an amazing deal! The professionalism, the beauty, the ease throughout the entire wedding process…everything was a dream! Whenever I was booking other vendors and I said I was getting married at Park Winters, they all said “oh, they’re the best.” And I wholeheartedly agree! All my guests keep talking about what a beautiful venue it was. I am so happy my husband and I can go back and stay overnight whenever we want to relive the wedding magic. Lastly, I want to thank Pieper, John, and the catering staff in particular. We wanted a totally vegetarian wedding, and we also wanted lots of vegan/GF options. Though it was outside their normal menu, Park Winters worked with us to create the best food for us and our guests. I know wedding food often leaves something to be desired, but not at Park Winters! I cannot recommend them highly enough.

The site coordinators Amber and Pieper were incredibly helpful, responsive, and flexible from the moment the contract was signed, and the waiters, waitresses, and bartenders day-of were both warm and professional. Our guests gushed about the scenery and the service all night and into the week following the wedding. As an added bonus, the food is amazing! It was even better than our tasting, and when we asked for specific changes (less salt) to one of the dishes, it was exactly right for us on the day. I can't recommend this place highly enough. As many here have said, it is a magical experience.

We got married at Park Winters in July of 2021 and it feels like our new home away from home. We first visited the venue in October of 2019 and fell in love. Although we consider...

ed other venues in Winters and in the Napa Valley, we kept coming back to Park Winters. We knew it was the place where we wanted to get married. We loved the natural beauty and that our guests could continually discover new areas of the property during the flow of our wedding. The town of Winters and Park Winters are undiscovered gems that were bound to surprise our guests in every way possible. We visited the venue a number of times during our planning process and each time the staff was always so wonderful and accommodating. Our tasting, in particular, took place right before one of the COVID shutdowns in December of 2020 and they still made it happen. It ended up being a private tasting and the team was so devoted to making us feel safe. It was a wonderful experience and the food was out of this world. Every meal was a gourmet masterpiece - all locally and sustainably sourced. The wedding day itself was perfect. Although it was a hot 102 degrees, the magic of Park Winters took us over and we hardly noticed. We received so many comments from our guests about how much they loved the property and how they had just had the best wedding food of their lives (seriously the stone fruit salad is to die for). Special shoutout to John, Amber and Dart for helping us along the way. You have built an extraordinary team that values guest experience. We still can’t believe that Park Winters is where we got married. We know we will be back for a farm-to-table dinner/stay at the venue in the years to come! Park Winters will always hold a special place in our hearts.

Park Winters is absolutely phenomenal - there are so many good things to say about the staff, the property, and the customer service! I had visited the site a few years prior to us...

e their pool for the day; when I got engaged, I knew that my husband and I would need to check it out as a venue for our wedding. Surprisingly, Park Winters was one of our most affordable options, but it absolutely does not look it! Amber was such a dream to work with - she is extremely responsive, kind, friendly, and professional. As an Executive Assistant, I'm used to planning events and knowing every tiny minute detail - both John and Amber were so patient with my thousands of questions during the planning process. Since we did not have a coordinator, I was worried that things wouldn't run smoothly the day of, but Park Winters really took ownership and made it easy for my husband and I not to worry about anything! They even had someone bring us appetizers while we were having our couple portraits taken, so that we wouldn't miss any of the food. Let me tell you, the food is not something to miss either - we had multiple guests let us know how delicious it was. Park Winters definitely does not provide traditional wedding style food, instead it is fresh and farm-to-table. We also upgraded some of our wines and they were able to include a local wine that they don't normally have on hand, which was such a treat. Eva, another staff member, was so sweet - she made sure that we had everything we needed while getting ready and the next morning for breakfast. The customer service at Park Winters is unparalleled - they know how to do weddings and they know how to do them extremely well. I would one million percent recommend Park Winters!

We stayed 2 nights with our whole wedding party and it felt like a mini getaway with no stress. The best part however is the people. Everyone that works at and with Park Winters is so lovely, caring and helpful. If I could I would do it all over again. I would highly highly recommend Park Winters for any event.

und it is new in the best ways but maintains the same charm. From the initial tour to the tasting, the final walk through, rehearsal and the big day, you are always treated like their VIP guest. Often times at weddings, food is an afterthought but Park Winters is a foodie’s dream! Overall, I couldn’t recommend it enough. Pro tip! We rented a shuttle for guests at the end of the night ONLY as Ubers and Lyfts are limited in that area. Worked out great!

property is beautiful and has many usable spaces for your wedding - an Inn to stay in, event barn, outdoor patio, and multiple beautiful outdoor ceremony locations. They can provide tables, seating, linens, silverware, and they do catering, so it is easy to knock out several wedding elements at once. The food there is also delicious! The property is a little out of the way and there is not a ton around it, nor are there a lot of super close hotels for guests (~20 min away), but if that's not a big deal to you, I would highly recommend Park Winters as a wedding venue. So many of our guests complimented us on the venue and asked how we had even found it given it's location! I can't wait to go back for a farm dinner and another stay at the inn

Park Winters was an absolute dream <3 My husband and I spent several months trying to find a wedding venue-we wanted to get married outdoors, in a garden, and have a beautiful, ele...

gant place to for a reception and dancing. And, just as important, the food needed to be exquisite. Since we were planning our wedding from afar (we live in Philly), we wanted a place that offered a package deal. We had a lot of trouble finding a place in California that met our budget and preferences, and all of the places in Colorado we looked at (our respective hometowns) that we loved were at altitude (which would have been dangerous for some of our older guests). We absolutely fell in love with Park Winters when we saw it. The gardens are even more beautiful than the pictures show and the dance hall is stunning. What was really amazing was that the whole place is an oasis in the middle of the central valley, so it attracts a ton of birds--the whole garden is full of birdsong. Best of all, Park Winters has a beautiful wild section--I really love natural gardens--and we were able to get some beautiful wedding shots in their fields and sitting in a tree. Working with Amber and John was a joy-they were incredibly patient and responsive. Both myself and my partner are very detailed oriented and had some strong preferences and traditions we wanted to follow, and they were more than happy to help in any way they could. This included giving 4+ tours of the property since my husband and I couldn't visit before setting the date (my maid of honor went in our stead), we had to go twice because our schedules didn't line up to go together the first time, and my mother had to see the venue because she was marrying us and needed to prepare the ceremony. We are so grateful and lucky we got to have our wedding at Park Winters!

ont door. During the hot summer, the front as well shaded from the sun. The ENTIRE staff is just so well-polished and friendly, and can predict your needs before you need them, starting at the top with John. They were able to customize the menu for our particular tastes and whims, and were very accommodating with special requests. We got the whole 24 hours to ourselves, which is so very nice, but beware that makes it harder to plan the rehearsal the day before, since another party may have exclusive access to the venue for that day. We did ours at the park in downtown Winters, which was fine. Another thing to consider (which is in no way PW's fault) is that the nearby hotels aren't very fancy, if that's what you're looking for for your guests, and they're all at least 20 minute drive away. These are minor considerations - overall highly recommended!

I don't think I have enough words to describe how much we LOVED Park Winters! We decided to have our wedding at this beautiful venue and we couldn't have made a better decision. ...

From the moment we walked on the property (before we even spoke to anyone) my husband and I fell in love with the property and we both just had a great feelings about it. Right from the beginning they treated us with nothing but warm hospitality and Grade A customer service. You really could not find a better place or people to work with. I could go on and on about all of the amazing aspects Park Winters offered for our wedding but here are just some highlights. First off, this venue will give you the most amazing photos. When my photographer went there for the first time, she was overwhelmed with all the amazing opportunities and areas she could take photos. I did not have one person at my wedding that did not mention how beautiful the venue was! Secondly, their food is absolutely amazing! Food is an important part of a wedding for both you and your guests and Park Winters offers the absolute best wedding and event food I have ever experienced. All the food they prepare will not feel like it is something catered for a large group such as a wedding but will feel like it was a meal just made for two with every little piece thought through with a purpose. Lastly, you will receive the best service possible with every step of the way. It is absolutely imperative to have a venue that will accommodate what you need and will make your life much less stressful. Every person you work with is extremely professional and gives great service. I don't believe you will work with another staff that is as great to work with as Park Winters. As I said, these are just a few of my highlights that really stand out and details I feel would be important to anyone looking for a wedding venue. I could honestly go on and on with rave reviews but in the end, go visit this property and see the beauty in person. If you decide to have your event at Park Winters, you will absolutely not regret it. This venue will lend to a beautiful and magical event and will gift you with a special day you will never forget.

tour I could tell this venue had great staff that provided top tier service. I didn't know the area well and it seemed further than the Sonoma properties we had toured which was not the case coming from SF. Venue is gorgeous no matter where your ceremony is on property (ours was in front of the sunken garden). We knew right when we walked from the parking lot in, this was going to be our place (we visited 8 sites). From the view of the fields to the fig forest, artichoke plants, swamp shack, pizza oven, gorgeous Victorian mixed with modern accommodations and the event barn with chandeliers - everything resonated with us. I wanted a California rustic feel without all the dust and dirt :) It truly is country luxury. The bathrooms are also very warm, nicely decorated and modern/clean which you won't find at other venues. Food is fresh, CA farm to table and we received rave reviews at dinner. We had the good fortune as no other events were booked before our wedding to stay several nights on property and our entire family had enough time to enjoy the pool, get ready for hair and makeup and have the ease of just walking upstairs after the last song was played to go to bed. The morning breakfast they serve with your stay - amazing is an understatement. Price point was fair for what we received and well worth the cost. Note the extreme temperatures during "off season" as it will get very hot but we prepared for it with parasols, fans, cold towels and well timed shade during our ceremony but if you want family (with kids) at your wedding - summer it is! I'll remember our time at Park Winters for the rest of my life and it truly is SO BEAUTIFUL. So many of my friends, family and coworkers asked me "where did you find this place?" They were so impressed once they set foot on property. They made us look GREAT and deserve every bit of business that comes their way because they are fantastic and it will be the best decision you ever made.

The property is absolutely breathtaking, the photos do not do it justice! There are so many areas to have the ceremony and reception. With beautiful outdoor landscapes as well as the air-conditioned event barn. The old fashioned Victorian house makes for the perfect backdrop for getting ready/ pre-wedding photos. Its truly the perfect combination of classic and modern. I have to say the entire staff was phenomenal at the event, and Park Winters definitely deserves an A+ in customer satisfaction.

Choosing Park Winters as our wedding venue (July 2017) was the ultimate "it" factor that absolutely MADE our wedding. It was the very first venue we toured, and then after visiting...

6-7 other venues and meeting with their owners, we just kept coming back to Park Winters in our minds. After seeing the stunning property, there really was no comparison. The lush greenery on the grounds that are maintained to perfection, the absolutely gorgeous Victorian inn, and the immaculate white wood reception "barn" made us fall in love from day 1. It was the venue of our dreams, and that was before we even knew exactly how DREAMY it was going to become! Throughout the planning process, Amber (the event coordinator) and John & Rafael (the owners) couldn't have possibly been more wonderful to work with. They were extremely responsive and helpful for the year-long planning process, and answered EVERY inquiry I had thoroughly and promptly -- and I had a LOT! When it came time to the final months leading up to our wedding, we began to see the true "Park Winters magic" really kick into gear. At our detailing meeting a couple months before the big day, we learned that when everyone talks about how mindblowingly good the food at Park Winters is, they're not exaggerating in the least. We were greeted with a full-fledged menu tasting complete with appetizers, and more cocktails than we knew what to do with -- all of which were riiiiii-diculously tasty, and I am NOT a "cocktail person". If Park Winters is your wedding venue, know right now that your guests will not have the average wedding dinner. Their food is truly some of the best we have ever had. The housekeeping and groundskeeping staff were absolute angels: sooooo helpful, a moment never passed where there wasn't someone checking in to make sure all of our needs were taken care of. When my husband and I woke up the morning after our wedding, I was greeted with fresh coffee and tea, and later, the most BEAUTIFUL morning-after brunch. Holy cow!!! No standard "continental breakfasts" here (well, NOTHING is "standard" here for that matter) -- all of our overnight guests were treated to a delicious full-service buffet on the patio. It was unreal, and the perfect way to spend the morning after our wedding. The #1 thing that comes to my mind when I reflect on our wedding at Park Winters is their incredible attention to detail. NO detail is too small, and EVERY detail is paid attention to. The drinks, decor, layout and timeline were all customized exactly to our preference, and when it came time for the big day, the Park Winters team executed flawlessly. It is sooooo apparent that everyone there truly cares about your day being perfect, and that they are no rookies to the wedding business -- we took such a sigh of relief knowing every detail was in the hands of true professionals. Wedding day came, and my husband and I truly felt like first class guests at our own wedding. All we had to do was show up to the most perfectly executed event I have ever seen, and have a blast. End of story. I could literally go on and on shouting from the rooftops how amazing Park Winters was (is!!!!). I couldn't have dreamed up a more magical spot to get married, and my husband and I look forward to coming back often. THANK YOU, PARK WINTERS TEAM, from the bottom of our hearts, for all you dedicate yourselves to, and for our picture-perfect wedding from start to finish!! \- Allison & Victor

A major plus is that the venue and grounds are so gorgeous that you don't need to spend much on decorations. Plus the chef is amazing and the food was delicious, as well as the presentation. We enjoyed a complementary tasting and tour before our wedding day and though we arrived each time when it was rainy the grounds were still magical. Luckily it did not rain on our wedding, but even with bad weather the place is just radiant. Can't say enough good things about the location and service!

Park Winters is the perfect place to make your fairytale come true! And the staff is wonderful- always professional, friendly, and responsive. John and Amber were very communicativ...

e and made our experience easy from the very beginning. We were immediately smitten when we first visited for our venue tour. We had some reservations about making our guests (a lot of whom were coming from out of state) come to the country. But once we set foot on the idyllic grounds of PW, it grabbed a hold of us and wouldn't let go! We knew we couldn't get married anywhere else. The property is absolutely stunning- I believe it would be impossible for anyone to come to any other conclusion. We got married in front of the rose and lavender garden on 5/6/17. The week before temperatures reached the upper nineties and I was worried about the roses frying, but they held on for us. Amber even sent me a video to assure me. We rented an arch and added flowers, but it was really superfluous. Park Winters' natural beauty is just so perfect, nothing more is really necessary. We had our reception in the barn and everything looked even better than I had envisioned. Again, the simple beauty of the space may be sufficient, but we did low profile fish bowl centerpieces and lots of candles to add to the ambiance. We sat at a sweetheart table and used a mix of rounds and rectangles for our ~120 guests. We also had a 7 piece band. I was worried about having enough space, but from my perspective, everything was perfect. We had to push back one of the tables once the dancing got going, but I didn't think it was too much of an issue. We stayed at the Inn the night of the wedding, as did some of my bridesmaids and a couple of other guests. The house is immaculate. Every detail was perfectly planned and executed. I highly recommend treating yourself to a night at the Inn after your wedding. It's nice not to worry about going anywhere after the reception, and Chef will treat you to a delicious breakfast in the morning (yes, the food is flawless too!). I wish we would have stayed there the night before so we could have enjoyed the grounds (and the pool!) even longer but it didn't work out logistically. We are already daydreaming about going back for a future anniversary (or babymoon!). In short, we absolutely LOVED everything about Park Winters, and I am confident that you will too.

The venue itself is spectacular, meticulously groomed and awe inspiring! From the moment we stepped out of our car, for the first time, we knew it was going to be an amazing experience. The property is a jewel and a perfect venue for a wedding. . Every w here you turn around, you see so many breathtaking views. Our wedding planner worked on all the fine details with Amber. She was great in helping to accommodate our needs. There are so many details and some stress in planning a wedding. But, John and Amber helped ease our stress and assured us that it would be amazing. . I had the upmost confidence in knowing it would be a beautiful wedding day for me. Weather in March is unpredictable, so we worked with John and Amber on a Plan B just in case it rained. But, we were lucky enough to have had the perfect day with sunny skies and temps in the 70's for our wedding. We had our wedding ceremony in front of the lavender rose garden which was the perfect back drop. The dining experience in "The Barn" was elegant, warm, and inviting. The staff was great in setting up the room and tables for our "Reception to remember for years to come". The service was outstanding. The food was delicious and cooked perfectly which melted in my mouth We stayed at the Inn along with some of our bridal party. The rooms were cozy, warm and beautiful. Every room had a spectacular view and the morning breakfast table was set beautifully and the food was scrumptious. We felt so much at home it was hard to leave the peace, beauty and tranquility. Thank you again John Rafael and Amber for making my dream wedding come true and with providing us with such an overall unforgettable experience. I highly recommend this venue and give it an exemplary review
