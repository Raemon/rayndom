About this vendor

Here at Kiss and Makeup Creations, we aim to make each bride look like a flawless version of their everyday self. It's my goal (and super power) to set each client's mind at ease. I have a knack for understanding my clients needs and wants without "over doing it." When you book my services, you not only receive perfect hair and makeup, but you are also receiving 20 years of trained experienced, when it comes to weddings I have seen it all and I know how things should be done, and when. Don't be surprised if I stick around to make sure your dress has been properly steamed, or if I have to perform and "emergency haircut" on the father of the bride (it happens). Please call or email today to inquire about your date. The sooner you book my services, the better, as I tend to book up quickly! (925)550-2569 text or call, kissandmakeupteresa@gmail.com I can't wait to feed you champagne and make you look like your best self!

time chatting as she got me ready. (Since it was an elopement it was just me - but we were chatting like old friends right away.) Teresa's products were high quality and I was pleased with my look. It was the natural glam I was looking for. I have a lot of hair and the style held up all day and night. Same with my makeup - no touch-ups needed. Thanks Teresa!

020\. Here's the thing I appreciated the most about Teresa - my bridal party covered the whole spectrum from people who love having their hair and makeup done (my MOH) to people who hate it (my mom) and everything in between, and absolutely everyone had a great time with Teresa! I think that's a testament to her as a professional, but also as a person. She went out of her way to make everyone happy and comfortable!

ient airstream trailer! My advice: just let her do her thing. She’s a pro and knows what she’s doing and what’ll look best. I’m no hair or makeup person (I don’t even own a brush), and didn’t really know what I wanted even the day of. I put it all in her hands and it turned out beautifully! Plus, she was kind enough to answer all my mom’s questions about what face creams SHE should be using. Lol. Plan on hiring her again for our rescheduled reception next year.

did my mom's hair and makeup and my sister's hair. They were so happy with what she did. They couldn't stop smiling. Teresa did my hair and makeup and it turned out flawless. She listened to what I wanted and went above and beyond. I'm so grateful that I found Teresa because she treated me like a friend and made the day so comfortable and easy. If you're looking for a cool, professional and extremely talented makeup and hair stylist, look no further. Teresa is the one for you!

d bridal party size certainly changed, but Teresa was available, flexible, and great throughout. I last minute asked Teresa to do my hair in addition to my makeup and it was AMAZING. Lots of compliments. She was able to easily adapt to requests of the (very small) bridal party ladies. Would absolutely recommend. 💯 would re-book for my non-COVID in-person non-livestream huuuuge wedding in the future! Husband is not a man of many words, but told me I looked “absolutely gorgeous.” Thanks, Teresa! 🥰

Teresa was not just a hair and makeup artist, but an emotional support as well, calming my nerves and replying quickly to questions I had leading up to the day. If you are thinking about hiring Teresa, do it!!!

ich I found to be very rare in her industry. I found Teresa after another makeup artist cancelled on me three weeks prior to my wedding. It just so happened that Teresa was free on my day, which was rare and so lucky! I'm so thankful it all happened this way, I know that I've made a lifelong friend with Teresa and I wouldn't have wanted anyone else there with me that day. Love her!

Teresa did hair and makeup for our destination wedding in Sonoma for myself, 2 bridesmaids, and 2 moms. As it was a destination wedding, we'd never met Teresa prior to the wedding/...

had no trial with her. I wear makeup/do my hair maybe 6 times a year and Teresa was incredibly kind, patient, and non-judgmental as I attempted to describe what I wanted done. Her work was PHENOMENAL. Exactly what I wanted -- natural but beautiful! The mom and bridesmaid who do their hair and makeup daily were also thrilled with her services. She has an innate ability to adapt to the client at hand that was very evident in our varied group. Teresa was fun to have in the room while getting ready and super low stress. Everything was finished on time with plenty of time for touch ups. She was highly professional and came prepared with every supply under the sun. Overall, she was a key part of our very relaxed, laid back, awesome wedding day. If you have a destination wedding and cannot meet her beforehand, rest assured you'll be pleased! I would strongly encourage you to book her!

mood, had us all laughing, and made everyone look flawless. I did a lot of research and their pricing is very affordable and worth every penny, book them and you won't regret it! they showed up right on time and did not get behind schedule, they even made sure we knew when to steam the dresses, eat, and cut off water unless we wanted to have to go during the ceremony. You can tell they have been doing this for YEARS. I cannot say enough great things!

doing my hair and makeup). Loved how she was able to sense my anxiousness and help me remember what a happy day it is, a calming force for sure. She did hair and makeup on myself, 3 bridesmaid as well as my mother and MIL. Everyone was so pleased with how everything turned out. I did do a trial with here several months in advance, and of course loved how my hair and makeup turned out! She was so flexible the day of with having to tweak our original plan as I had cut several inches off of my hair but I absolutely loved what she did! My hair and make up lasted all night with hours of dancing. Wishing we were closer to use her for future events. Will refer her any chance I get!

She not only took the time, but was genuinely eager to listen to my hair and makeup vision and was always honest in her professional opinions, which I so greatly appreciated (because let's be honest, I didn't know what the heck I was thinking). Teresa made me feel so beautiful on my wedding day and her warm, calm and kind demeanor put me at ease the entire day.
