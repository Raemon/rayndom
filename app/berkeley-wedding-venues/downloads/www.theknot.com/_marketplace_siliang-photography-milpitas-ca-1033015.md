The pair were so attentive, running around to get the perfect shot from the perfect angle without being intrusive or getting in the middle of the moment. Just so professional, thoughtful, and kind! Would highly recommend. Thank you Siliang Photography for capturing the beautiful memories!

adaptable) but he (and his lovely partner) offered us something no other photographer could, which was his talent and style. Watching our wedding video, the way he uses his cinematic skills, it’s just - I don’t even have the words. I love all of our photos, I love our video, and I absolutely love his photography style. Siliang preserved the memories from our wedding and made them presentable to us in the form of a dreamy movie, and I’m so happy he was available on our wedding date. Thank you, Siliang!

ded to hire someone who was really talented with candid-type photos. As soon as I saw Siliang’s portfolio, I knew I had to hire him. Not only are Siliang’s photos very eye catching, but they also help tell a story and convey emotion which I think makes them so much more compelling to look at than any other wedding photographer’s photos that I’ve seen. His photos are more like pieces of art. Siliang managed to capture the most beautiful moments of our elopement. My husband and I are camera shy, but Siliang understood that and made us feel very comfortable. I was blown away by the end result. He has a true talent and a great, artistic eye. During our interactions, Siliang was also very professional and responsive. He arrived at the location on time. You must hire him as your photographer!!

My husband and I hired Siliang to photograph our wedding ceremony and reception in San Francisco on June 2, 2023, and we are so happy we did! From the very beginning, Siliang was s...

uper easy to communicate with. We had an intro call and then he toured the venue with us. We ended up postponing our wedding by a year, and also changed the reception venue and Siliang was very accommodating and empathetic throughout. On the day of, he worked with a co-photographer. In just over 3 weeks after the wedding, he shared more than a thousand photos with so many amazing ones! He captured the day perfectly and struck a great balance of posed, candid, fun, emotional and several delightfully unexpected photographs! He is not your run of the mill wedding photographer who is heavy on post-edits or added effects. His aesthetic and style of photography is very matter of fact - he will find moments that truly capture the day and make photos that are pleasing, insightful and evocative. I am a fan of his approach and I love that it imparted truthfulness and timelessness to our wedding photos without being overdone. If that speaks to you, hire Siliang now!

He went over and beyond our expectations - thank you!!

obtrusively capturing the best candid shots you could imagine -- people at their best, having a great time, perfectly framed. He got fantastic shots of a bunch of our guests that we're excited to share with them. He has a great eye for composition too: our wedding and engagement were both outdoors and Siliang used the nature, trees, reflections on water, sunset, etc. in really gorgeous ways. He was easy to work with and went above and beyond. We wholeheartedly recommend him!

reparations for pictures. He has an incredible eye for angles, catching the right moments and effects that bring that high quality dream wedding pictures to your front screen. He is self managed at an event, the type of person you don't even have to go ask him to take photos of a certain group or capturing a time in a picture because he already beat you to it. He also had the pictures ready way ahead of the projected time. I highly recommend him for any kind of event specifically and specially if it is your wedding.

He immediately became like family to us, so much so that people at our wedding just thought he was one of our friends (which by that point he was!) He is great at capturing those "in between" moments, and making you feel completely comfortable in front of the camera. He is up for any adventure and really fun to be around and work with. He was so flexible and accommodating, and was a huge help even during our planning process, offering us insight and advice to make our day go as smoothly as possible.
