To help you plan your winter wedding florals just right, we spoke with Keterah Whetzel, the floral designer and owner of [One Last Avocado](https://onelastavocado.com/), based in Timberville, Virginia, for an insider's scoop on how to style winter wedding florals. When you're ready, head to [The Knot Vendor Marketplace](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/florists) and filter by price and bouquet type to find the floral expert able to make your winter floral dreams a reality.

**In this article:**What Are the Best Flowers for Winter Wedding Bouquets? | Winter Wedding Bouquet Ideas | Where to Find Winter Wedding Bouquets

## What Are the Best Flowers for Winter Wedding Bouquets?

Whetzel shares that "while there isn't a best flower for winter weddings, I always appreciate leaning into seasonality. For winter, that means hardy evergreens, ornamental kale, dried elements preserved from the growing season and early forced flowering branches in late winter." These are some of the more common [in-season winter wedding flowers](https://www.theknot.com/content/winter-weddings-fresh-flower-ideas).

FEATURED VIDEO FROM THE KNOT

"Then, I pair these with imported flowers like roses and ranunculus," Whetzel says. "These romantic mass flowers offer a beautiful focal point. I also like to keep it simple and cozy in winter, lots of greenery, with a few carefully chosen flowers instead of the beautiful cacophony of summer flowers. Even if nothing is growing outside, the season still can influence your wedding bouquet in an impactful way." 

Whetzel also encourages couples to**"** opt for warmth in your design when it's cold outside. Blue is a common color for winter weddings, but I prefer it only as an accent. One of my favorite winter palettes is a monochromatic red floral arrangement—it's magic. Pair deep red with accents of lighter red! I also love berry tones, with burgundy (blackberry), raspberry, lavender, and just a hint of strawberry red and magenta." Lastly, she shares that you can't go wrong with "deep green with cream and shades of purple for an ethereal and wintry mix."

### 1\. Simple Winter Wedding Bouquet With Eucalyptus 

![bride holding winter wedding bouquet with eucalyptus and evergreens](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/9da7e3fe-fa70-45f4-83e1-ca5fa4222d35~rs_768.h-cr_0.1274.4024.5298)

_Photo: Brie Thompson Photography,__Floral Design: Boise At Its Best Flowers_

While evergreens are popular in many winter wedding bridal bouquet ideas, they're not your only option when it comes to greenery filler. In this design, the florist artfully blended eucalyptus with evergreens for a texturally engaging look. 

### 2\. Elegant White Winter Wedding Bouquet Finished With Evergreens

![simple winter wedding bouquet with evergreen branches](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/8a3d8e53-56af-47f0-9418-7130e3259c51~rs_768.h-cr_0.137.706.843)

We love the juxtaposition between bold evergreens and soft, lush white blooms in this winter wedding bouquet idea. The design included a blend of white garden roses in addition to white butterfly ranunculus blooms.

### 3\. Simple, Small Winter Wedding Bouquet With Dusty Miller

![elegant winter wedding bouquet with dusty miller](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/d2b80e8c-94de-4a66-9e80-fada85ecaa9b~rs_768.h-cr_0.603.1458.2061)

_[Photo: Vanessa Joy Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/vanessa-joy-photography-leander-tx-436991),__[Floral Design: Fleur-de-lis Florist](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/fleurdelis-florist-skaneateles-ny-381018)_

Dusty miller is a great filler to use in small winter wedding bouquets because the silver-green leaves resemble velvet and add a cozy vibe to any design where they're utilized. Another great option that's similar to dusty miller is lamb's ear. 

### 4\. Regal Jewel-Tone Winter Wedding Bouquet With Blue and Purple

![jewel-tone winter wedding bouquet](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/8ed00d72-ba04-4499-aa73-1a238e096333~rs_768.h-cr_0.871.3000.3871)

Jewel tones look great at any point during the year, but we're especially partial to winter wedding bouquets that include rich winter wedding colors like blues, reds and purples. 

### 5\. Small Winter Wedding Bouquets for Bridesmaids

![Simple winter wedding bouquet with burgundy flowers](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/baf62492-04e3-42d9-8c5b-7fc63cd71540~rs_768.h-cr_0.350.1600.1950)

_Photo: Pat Furey x LongBrook Photography,__Floral Design: Beautiful Blooms Events_

If you don't want to go all-in on jewel tones, consider combining the vibrant colors with some neutrals, like the floral designer for this wedding did. Pops of burgundy paired nicely with lighter shades of cream and white, which is a great color palette for other [bridesmaid bouquet ideas](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridesmaid-bouquets). 

### 6\. Dramatic Winter Wedding Bouquet With Anthurium

![bride holding winter wedding bouquet outside in the snow](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/6f997a86-517e-458b-9649-4b516ba0c27b~rs_768.h-cr_0.251.1080.1331)

Did you know that anthurium isn't just for summer weddings? The unique bloom certainly looks nice at tropical events, but this winter bouquet is proof that the flower is just as striking during the colder months. 

### Find your kind of venue

From barns to ballrooms, discover reception venues that feel like you.

### 7\. Romantic Burgundy Winter Wedding Bouquet 

![bride holding burgundy winter wedding bouquet](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/0d32ccdc-3c6e-4e12-b6cb-68f79f5196f8~rs_768.h-cr_404.0.2324.1920)

_[Photo: Photography Anthology](https://photographyanthology.com/),__Floral Design: Shean Strong Design_

Burgundy winter wedding bouquets simply never get old. Any shade of red evokes romance, but burgundy is an especially great avenue to go when it comes to wedding bouquet ideas for winter.

### 8\. Round All-White Wedding Bouquet 

![bride holds oversized round wedding bouquet with white roses and winter evergreens around the bottom](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/b3976c52-f572-4c31-be09-547d1791a1bb~rs_768.h-cr_0.882.3000.3882)

_[Photo: Elizabeth Austin Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/elizabeth-austin-photography-atlanta-ga-768093),__Floral Design: The Rosy Posy_

If your bouquet is relatively simple in terms of flower varieties, consider amping up the size to make it stand out just a little more. This classic design features spray roses, garden roses and hydrangeas, but its larger shape makes it impossible to miss. Such a beautiful choice as far as white winter bouquets for weddings go. 

### 9\. Winter Wedding Bouquet With Peonies 

![bride wearing brown fur jacket holds winter wedding bouquet with white peonies, blush roses, cotton puffs and gold spray painted greenery](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/02f59519-297c-4f17-9b3f-35e92665ed00~rs_768.h-cr_0.683.3840.4523)

_[Photo: Lauren Fair Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/lauren-fair-photography-pennsburg-pa-396575)_

Peonies are traditionally a [springtime wedding flower](https://www.theknot.com/content/spring-wedding-flowers), but they look right at home in this white bouquet of roses, ranunculus and greenery. Fluffy cotton bolls and gilded evergreens add a distinctive wintry finish.

### 10\. Pink and Red Winter Wedding Bouquet 

![bride stands with bridesmaids wearing red velvet dresses and holding pink and dark burgundy bouquets with long ribbons](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/980556c3-eb23-4432-bd3b-47b2ff51072b~rs_768.h-cr_433.0.2433.2000)

_[Photo: Alicia White Photography](https://www.aliciawhitephoto.com/),__[Floral Design: Floressence Flowers](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/floressence-flowers-brevard-nc-613115)_

Winter bridesmaid bouquets don't need to be an exact replica of the main bouquet, but it's common for them to feature the same types of flowers on a smaller scale. Silk ribbons finished off these arrangements of roses, astilbe and bay leaves.

### 11\. Pastel Garden-Style Wedding Bouquet 

![romantic winter wedding bouquet with blush and mauve roses, smilax and white astrantia](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/0f3b4d75-4273-4b45-856a-e305902812fc~rs_768.h-cr_0.154.2500.2654)

_[Photo: Brianna Wilbur Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/brianna-wilbur-photography-mechanicsburg-pa-766121),__Floral Design: Laura of Lauxmont_

If you're choosing pastels as your [winter wedding colors](https://www.theknot.com/content/winter-wedding-colors), consider adding a darker accent tone for contrast. Mauve and burgundy tulips were an unexpected (but gorgeous) addition to this bouquet.

### 12\. Burgundy Winter Wedding Bouquet With Greenery 

![dark burgundy winter wedding bouquet with eucalyptus and ferns](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/54bc303b-2a60-4e30-a29a-a070810284c5~rs_768.h-cr_0.108.1080.1188)

Merlot and crimson flowers bring a sultry vibe to your wedding day. Offset the deeper colors of an arrangement with touches of greenery, such as spiral eucalyptus or ferns.

### 13\. Blue Winter Wedding Bouquet 

![bridesmaid wearing light blue shawl holds small winter bouquet with blue delphinium, white ranunculus and greenery](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/b552f741-9e67-4035-b5a9-58d2bcce9e58~rs_768.h-cr_0.597.3000.3597)

Perfect for a late winter or early spring wedding, this small posy includes blue delphinium, hydrangeas and ranunculus with soft dusty miller and lemon leaves.

### 14\. Simple Greenery Winter Wedding Bouquet 

![minimalist winter wedding bouquet with white flowers and greenery](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/ddc223d9-8e11-4b7f-a572-196a85460288~rs_768.h-cr_489.0.2889.2400)

Greenery is always in season and goes with nearly any wedding style—plus, you can use it as the primary focus of any simple winter wedding bouquets. This minimalistic design features eucalyptus, white lisianthus and wax flowers.

### 15\. Formal Winter Wedding Bouquet 

![bride and bridesmaids hold bouquets with ivory roses, dusty miller, silver brunia, eucalyptus and long gold and silver metallic ribbons](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/0b0bc6dd-d35b-430b-b25a-a8774908be67~rs_768.h-cr_0.199.3600.3799)

_[Photo: Brittany + Devin Photo Co.](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/brittany-+-devin-photo-co-petoskey-mi-619664)_

Along with the addition of shimmering ribbons, tightly arranged flowers will give a more formal look to your bouquet. These bouquets were picture-perfect with a wintry assortment of cream roses, ivory ranunculus, silver brunia, succulents and baby's breath.

### 16\. Alternative Hoop Bouquets for Bridesmaids 

![bridesmaids wearing mix and match navy blue gowns hold hoop bouquets with burgundy, blush and blue faux flowers](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/80bc6356-bc94-4ceb-a218-96a530fc8b89~rs_768.h-cr_350.0.2350.2000)

Don't feel restricted to traditional bouquets if they don't suit your [wedding style](https://www.theknot.com/wedding-vision). Get creative with [alternative wedding bouquets](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-bouquet-alternatives), such as carrying floral hoops, pomanders or baskets of flowers.

### 17\. Small Winter Wedding Bouquet With Brooch 

![classic winter wedding bouquet with white roses decorated with black ribbon and silver rhinestone brooch on the stems](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/d4710f23-9d6d-4504-a3c3-6565e55e7ab5~rs_768.h-cr_0.706.3000.3706)

Expecting snow on your wedding day? Match the icy weather forecast with a simple bouquet of white roses (you'll love how the stems of greenery pop in the photos). A black ribbon bouquet wrap and sparkling brooch will also stand out.

### 18\. Prismatic Jewel-Tone Winter Wedding Bouquet 

![Jewel tone winter wedding bouquet](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/cb5dbb3a-810f-47e8-94a5-facdb36627fd~rs_768.h-cr_0.104.900.1004)

_[Photo: Jen Dillender Photography](https://jendillenderphotography.com/wp1/)_

A selection of gemstone-inspired jewel tones, like ruby red, amethyst, emerald and sapphire, taps into the festive vibes of the season without coming across as overtly wintry.

### 19\. Romantic Blush Winter Wedding Bouquet 

![oversized garden style wedding bouquet with blush and ivory roses, jasmine vines, lisianthus, sweet peas and ranunculus](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/f56b8680-f301-4d2f-b5be-008a77600250~rs_768.h-cr_0.215.1080.1295)

Soft pink is a [popular wedding color](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-color-palettes-we-love), no matter the time of year. For winter, we'd recommend pairing it with white and avoiding too many other pastels (think lilac or butter yellow) to prevent the color palette from looking out of place.

Not only are amaryllis among the most popular winter wedding flowers, but they're a gorgeous option if you're looking for a standout bloom. While the bright red variety is perfect for a Christmas wedding bouquet, amaryllis are also available in white, pink and peach.

### 31\. Classic White Winter Wedding Bouquet

This rounded winter wedding bouquet is an elegant example of how you can tap into a wintry look with a neutral color scheme. Add a few sprigs of fragrant greenery, like cedar or pine branches, for a touch of holiday merriment (tartan wedding dress sash optional!). 

### 32\. Cascading Poinsettia Wedding Bouquet

A [cascading wedding bouquet](https://www.theknot.com/content/13-modern-cascading-pageant-wedding-bouquets) adds a dramatic finishing touch to your look, especially when it's filled with deep red blooms similar to poinsettias. Use ribbons to emphasize one of the arrangement's accent colors, like the dark burgundy flowers here. A variety of textures work so well in winter wedding flower bouquets.

### 33\. Modern Christmas Wedding Bouquet

Pale green eucalyptus, blush roses and silver brunia come together in this frosty, cool-toned arrangement. With pops of deep red and a grand protea at the center, we love it as a trendy take on Christmas-inspired style. When it comes to burgundy winter wedding bouquets, this is the way to go.

### 34\. Dark Red Wedding Bouquet With Amaranthus

_[Photo: Lauren Fair Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/lauren-fair-photography-pennsburg-pa-396575)_

One of the more rustic winter wedding bouquets, this luxe arrangement uses bold and beautiful roses to make its statement. Hints of icy blue, pops of blush pink and plenty of textures all complement each other, while a royal blue velvet ribbon ties it all together.

### 37\. Icy Blue Wedding Bouquet With White Roses

![Icy Blue Wedding Bouquet With White Roses](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/8db2cf58-1d78-4954-99a2-512315f08690~rs_768.h-cr_0.120.1458.2064)

When it comes to [white wedding bouquets](https://www.theknot.com/content/white-wedding-flowers), this one is classically beautiful with just a hint of spunk from the frosted pine cones. The varied size of the flowers and greenery is the perfect contrast to the bride's lace dress, infusing the ensemble with wintry romance.

### 38\. Vintage Winter Bridal Bouquet With Succulents

No one said a winter wedding bouquet had to only involve flowers. Many winter wedding bouquets can come together using succulents as well, as showcased here.

### 39\. Deep Red Peony Bouquet With Green Velvet Ribbon

![Deep Red Peony Bouquet With Green Velvet Ribbon](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/edc100bf-4cc3-45ee-ae5e-b2367b11e3ae~rs_768.h-cr_0.122.1458.2066)

_[Photo: MNC Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/mnc-photography-st-louis-mo-567165)_

Bring a bit of brightness to your winter wedding with pops of yellow and green like this bouquet. The large, deep green leaves still give cold-weather vibes, so it doesn't feel out of place.

### 41\. Dried, Whimsical Winter Wedding Bouquet

_[Photo: onelove photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/onelove-photography-san-francisco-ca-2030853),__Floral design: Maison De LaCroix_

During the season when so much seems to be tucked away and hibernating for the winter, a dried floral bouquet just makes sense. This florist used tallow berries, raw cotton bolls, sola flowers, phalaris, gold button flowers, gold misty caspia and silver brunia to create this beauty. 

### 42\. Cascading Winter Wedding Bouquet

![Cascading Winter Wedding Bouquet](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/6207247d-0c80-4cb8-9ec5-d901db68ebe6~rs_768.h-cr_0.110.1335.1890)

Going for a woodsy, natural feel, this stunning bouquet used small pinecones, evergreen fronds, petite roses and wax flowers to build a lush arrangement. The floral choices gave it an organic look, which fit well into the upstate New York surroundings. 

### 43\. Glamorous Winter Wedding Bouquet With Berries

White is such a classic color for celebrations near the holidays, but adding pops of color to it is one of the best [winter wedding ideas](https://www.theknot.com/content/winter-wedding-dos-and-donts). This arrangement used red hypericum berries to do just that, while two types of roses act as the centerpiece.

### 44\. New Year's Eve Wedding Bouquet

![New Year's Eve Wedding Bouquet](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/e5db5bd1-d389-40a1-bcfb-13056dbdf9ad~rs_768.h-cr_0.120.1458.2064)
