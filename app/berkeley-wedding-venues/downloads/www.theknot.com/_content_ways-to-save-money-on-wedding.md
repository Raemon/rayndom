No matter how generous your budget is, we'll bet you've spent at least one sleepless night researching how to save money on a wedding. That's totally normal—the [average cost of a wedding](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-budget-ways-to-save-money) is $35,000, according to [The Knot 2023 Real Weddings Study](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-data-insights/real-weddings-study). And that's not accounting for the extra budget bandwidth required to wed in a more-expensive location, like a coastal city, or to accommodate a high guest count. "Couples are always looking for ways to be savvy with their wedding budget, regardless of the overall amount they plan to spend," says Emily Coyne, wedding planner at and owner of the California-based [Emily Coyne Events](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/emily-coyne-events-napa-ca-1090044). "I've found that it's less about cutting corners and more about making intentional choices."

## 1\. Hire a Pro Wedding Planner

"It might sound counterintuitive, but hiring a wedding planner is a smart way to save money," says Cameron Forbes, wedding planner and founder of [Forbes Functions](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/forbes-functions-east-hampton-ny-2079263#:~:text=About%20this%20vendor&text=Forbes%20Functions%20offers%20specialized%20event,gatherings%20aligned%20with%20their%20vision.) in New York, New York. "A good wedding planner knows where to find savings and which elements offer the most flexibility. We've built relationships with vendors for exclusive discounts, know when to negotiate and can suggest alternatives that still align with your style but come at a lower cost." Coyne agrees that this is one of the best ways to save money on a wedding: "Whether it's negotiating with vendors, finding creative alternatives or advising on where to splurge versus where to scale back, a wedding planner is there to ensure you get the best value for your investment. It's all about being strategic and resourceful, so you can have the wedding of your dreams without unnecessary stress over the budget."

## 2\. Use a Wedding Budget Tool

If you're not hyper organized during the wedding planning process, you can very easily slip into overspending mode. That's why using [The Knot Budget Tool ](https://www.theknot.com/wedding-budget)(it's free!) is essential—it'll help you understand what a practical budget is for your area and nail down your spending priorities, line item by line item. 

## 3\. Trim Your Guest List

We know it's hard to consider celebrating without certain friends and family members, but cutting your guest list is the easiest way to reduce your budget. It'll lower everything, including the cost of catering, invitations, venue and rentals. "[Streamlining your guest list](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-to-cut-wedding-guest-list) to a more intimate gathering not only enhances the personal experience, but also helps manage costs across various services," says Coyne.

## 4\. Keep Your Wedding Party Small

While your wedding party pays for a lot of expenses themselves (attire, travel, etc.), there are certain items the couple traditionally pays for (bridesmaid bouquets, boutonnieres, wedding party gifts and the like.). If you can swing it, the fewer attendants you enlist, the less you'll spend.

## 5\. DIY Selectively

You've probably been told by well-meaning loved ones: "DIYing saves you money!" And in some cases, it does. But DIYing certainly isn't free—you'll need to purchase supplies, which can add up. And don't forget about the time and potential stress of, say, frantically painting 100+ votives as your hand cramps and your eyes droop. When it comes to [DIY dos and don'ts](https://www.theknot.com/content/diy-wedding-dos-and-donts), Forbes says: "Focus on smaller projects like seating cards or signage, and avoid large-scale DIY decor that could end up costing more in the long run," says Forbes. 

## 6\. Keep a Holistic View

"Many couples overspend on venues by allocating too much of their budget before considering other essential costs like flowers, invitations and photography," says Coyne. "Utilize online resources and seek advice from recently married friends to get a clear picture of all expenses. Understanding the full scope of costs beforehand will help you allocate your budget wisely and avoid financial strain."

## 7\. Keep the Same Venue for the Ceremony and Reception

Having your ceremony and reception at one location will cut travel time for vendors you'd have to pay by the hour. You can potentially secure a better rate or more comprehensive package this way. Plus, it saves you the time and cost of finding a second space as well as dealing with guest transportation. 

[Check Out Some Venues](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace)

### Find your kind of venue

From barns to ballrooms, discover reception venues that feel like you.

## 8\. Wed in the Off Season or on a Less-Popular Day

Depending on where you plan to tie the knot, you could save hundreds, even thousands, of dollars by doing so in your destination's off-season or during one of the general wedding [shoulder seasons](https://www.theknot.com/content/is-there-an-off-season-for-weddings) (typically late fall and early spring). We know the weather might not be as optimal, but it could totally be worth a February event to afford your dream venue. Additionally, booking your celebration on [less expensive days of the week to wed](https://www.theknot.com/content/less-expensive-days-for-weddings), like Friday or Sunday (or pretty much any non-Saturday), could be the answer to your budget prayers. And [weekday weddings](https://www.theknot.com/content/thinking-about-having-a-weekday-wedding-read-this-first) are totally trending right now, so don't discount a Monday or Thursday. "Choosing an off-peak date or a weekday for your wedding can lead to substantial savings, as venues and vendors often offer lower rates during these times," says Coyne.

## 9\. Keep Your Catering Simple and Seasonal

"One of the best ways to save money on catering is by opting for a more creative, yet simplified menu," says Coyne. "Consider serving a few well-chosen, high-quality dishes rather than an extensive multi-course meal. Additionally, working with seasonal ingredients and local vendors can significantly cut costs while still offering delicious and fresh options."

[Score a Caterer](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/catering)

## 10\. Skip the Sit-Down Dinner

[Family-style](https://www.theknot.com/content/family-style-wedding-dinner) or [buffet setups](https://www.theknot.com/content/costs-for-different-meal-options) can be more cost effective than plated dinners. A cocktail-style reception will let your guests fill up on tasty passed apps to the point where they won't miss a heavy entrée. A [brunch reception](https://www.theknot.com/content/throwing-a-wedding-reception-brunch) will also save you a few bucks, if you're willing to forego dancing into the wee hours for fluffy stacks of waffles. 

## 11\. Streamline Your Sips

Limiting your drink options to one or two [signature cocktails](https://www.theknot.com/content/your-ultimate-signature-cocktail-finder) and perhaps some beer and wine will cut down your alcohol spend significantly. You can get creative with your wedding cocktail names and your guests won't miss the full bar. You could even swap in a [signature mocktail](https://www.theknot.com/content/mocktail-ideas) to reduce expenses further (and to offer a fun booze-free bev option). 

[Score a Savvy Bartender](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/bar-services)

## 12\. Cool It With the Passed Apps

Passed hors d'oeuvres tend to be more expensive than stationary appetizers. While you can have a couple of snacks circulating, focus your budget on serve-yourself bites, like a gorgeous charcuterie board or crudités.

## 13\. Skip the Champagne Toast

If you're set on a toast moment, all that matters is guests having a glass in their hand. Let people say "cheers" with whatever cocktail they're holding or opt for one of champagne's more affordable cousins: prosecco, cava or other sparkling wine.

## 14\. Buy Your Own Booze

Some venues will allow you to [purchase your own alcohol](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-to-stock-the-bar-at-your-wedding) for the big day, which can mean big savings. Just make sure that a licensed bartender will be doing the serving.

## 15\. Go Cutting Cake in the Front, Sheet Cakes in the Back

"Consider ordering a small, decorative cutting cake and serving guests from more affordable sheet cakes," says Coyne. "Be transparent with your bakery about your budget and preferences, and ensure you understand any potential additional costs."

[Find a Sweet Baker](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/wedding-cake-bakeries)

## 16\. Keep Cake Embellishments to a Minimum

Regarding how to cut costs on a wedding cake, Coyne says: "Focus on simplicity. Opt for a buttercream finish instead of fondant and use real flowers for decoration rather than intricate sugar flowers."

## 17\. Embrace a Wedding Cake Alternative

"If cake isn't a priority, consider [wedding cake alternatives](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-cake-alternatives-desserts) like cupcakes, a dessert bar or a fun treat like donuts or ice cream," says Coyne. "These options add a personal touch and can help you stay within your budget.

## 18\. Choose Just a Few Seasonal Flowers Arranged With Greenery

Forbes underscores the importance of using [seasonal flowers](https://www.theknot.com/content/flowers-by-season) in your arrangements, since importing flowers that are out of season in your wedding spot can get costly. Your second best option is to choose from widely available, year-round blossoms, like roses, calla lilies and orchids. It's also smart to select a smaller number of stems (you might be able to get some serious bulk savings if you focus on just a couple of flower types) and fill in space with lush greenery. 

[Find a Florist](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/florists)

## 19\. Spend on Guest-Facing Arrangements That Can Do Double Duty

"When planning your floral budget, focus on the arrangements that'll be most visible and enjoyed by your guests, such as those on the dinner tables," says Coyne. "Consider skipping floral arrangements for the wedding party, like bouquets and boutonnieres, and opt for a single elegant stem with a silk ribbon instead—this often looks more intentional and sophisticated. For the ceremony, think about placing flowers along the aisle instead of at the front. These can often be repurposed for the reception, saving both money and effort."

## 20\. Let Your Venue's Details Shine

This might sound counterintuitive when it comes to how to cut wedding expenses, but selecting a venue with details you adore—and would be happy with as your wedding day decor—will save you cash on decorations in the long run. Think: a museum, botanical garden or ornate house of worship.

## 21\. Bring in Non-Floral Decor

No need to splurge on buds if you don't care about them. Try adding books, votives, seashells, extra candles, heirloom photos or other [non-floral elements](https://www.theknot.com/content/non-floral-centerpieces) to your day. Bonus points if you can rent any of these items instead of buying them or bring them in from your personal collection of home decor (which adds an extra-special touch, we think). Plus, you can possibly repurpose some decor elements from the ceremony to the reception.

[Score Some Decor](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/wedding-decor-shops)

## 22\. Be Choosey With Linens

There are so many gorgeous table linens out there, and it can be tempting to upgrade to the fanciest tablecloths available. Instead, just use the expensive tablecloths on your cake or escort card table and feature budget-friendly linens on the guest tables. Alternatively, upgrade the napkins and skip the pricey tablecloths.

[Check Out Rental Vendors](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/wedding-rentals)

## 23\. Go Digital in Any Way You Can for Your Stationery

Certain printing techniques, like letterpress, engraving and foil stamping, are beautiful, but pricey. Choose a semi-custom, digital-printed option (like the suites on [The Knot Invitations](https://www.theknot.com/paper)) instead for a more-affordable option. Alternatively, you can go paperless with [fully digital wedding invitations](https://www.theknot.com/content/digital-invitation-options), or opt for print invites and [digital save-the-dates](https://www.theknot.com/content/online-save-the-dates) to get the best of both worlds while saving a little money.

[Your Invites, Right Here](https://www.theknot.com/paper)

## 24\. Keep your Stationery Suite Minimal

The heavier your wedding invitation envelope is, the more it'll cost to mail. Skip the slew of enclosure cards and opt for a single additional piece of stationery tucked in with your invitations directing guests to your wedding website, where—if you [made one with The Knot](https://www.theknot.com/gs/wedding-websites)—guests can RSVP digitally for free (no extra envelopes and stamps required for RSVP cards). "Consider limiting the number of printed items by incorporating details, like RSVPs and wedding information, on a wedding website, which can elegantly complement your stationery while reducing expenses," says Coyne. 

## 25\. Book an Emerging or Associate Wedding Photographer or Videographer

Some emerging photographers can produce exquisite results, so don't be deterred by a lower price if you're wowed by a shooter's portfolio. Or, [ask a more experienced photographer](https://www.theknot.com/content/questions-to-ask-wedding-photographer) or videographer about booking an associate. Oftentimes, great vendors can recommend another person who works for them at a lower price, meaning you get a similar vibe and quality, just not the one most in demand. 

[Find a Photo Pro](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/wedding-photographers)

## 26\. Take Advantage of Photo Packages and Bundles

"Book a photographer who offers both engagement and wedding day photography as part of a bundled package, which can often be more cost effective," says Coyne. "Bundling photography and videography services with a single vendor is another way to achieve savings, as many offer attractive packages. You can also opt for a package that includes digital images only, allowing you to print your favorites later." Many photographers and videographers will also allow you to customize your packages, removing things you don't need (extra filming time, parents' albums, etc.) to keep things within budget. 

## 27\. Book a Photographer of Videographer for a Shorter Duration

"Prioritize quality over quantity," says Coyne. "Consider hiring a photographer for a shorter duration to capture the most essential moments, like the ceremony and key reception highlights. 

## 28\. Hire a Local Photographer and Videographer

Many photographers and videographers charge additional fees if they have to travel more than a certain distance to your event. Narrow your search to photo and video pros who are based near your wedding's location.

## 29\. Choose a Highlight Reel Over a Full Film

"A well-edited highlight reel can offer a beautifully concise narrative, allowing you to relive the essence of your day without the expense of a full-length film," says Coyne.

[Check Out Videographers](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/wedding-videographers)

## 30\. Shop for Your Wedding Attire Early

If you're shopping for a wedding dress, we recommend starting to shop at least eight months before your big day. By cutting it too close, you may incur rush fees or other charges.

[Plan Your Shopping Trip](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/bridal-salons)

## 31\. Check Out Sample Sales and Trunk Shows

Doing some research ahead of time can help you save. Call local dress salons and find out if there are any sample sales or trunk shows coming up. These events can mean big savings.

## 32\. Select an Understated Wedding Gown

The more beading, embroidery or detail a gown has, the more expensive it'll be. Choose a more minimalist style to save and, if you're missing the sparkle, add accessories like a sash, headpiece, brooch or piece of jewelry.

## 33\. Rent or Rewear Attire for Other Wedding Events

Buying an all-new wardrobe for your many wedding-related events can definitely add up. Instead, opt to rent attire for your rehearsal dinner, shower, engagement party and other celebrations to save. If you order lots of outfits from the same retailer, there could be even more chances to save. For example, if you encourage all the groomsmen to rent their suits or tuxes from the same place, the groom's tux might be free. Or just wear something you love from your closet for a prewedding event or two (underconsumption is in). 

## 34\. Choose a DJ or Fewer Musicians Over a Full Band

"Consider hiring a talented DJ instead of a live band or, if live music is on your [wedding planning checklist](https://www.theknot.com/content/12-month-wedding-planning-countdown), choose a smaller ensemble or solo musician," says Coyne. DJs are almost always less expensive than live musicians. Although, the smaller the band, the fewer people and equipment you'll need to pay for. It's not always an option, but cutting down your band from 12 pieces to eight or even six instruments and vocalists is an easy way to save on live music.

[Cool DJs, Right Here](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/wedding-djs)

## 35\. Make Music Pros Do Double Duty

Hire a band or DJ who can do both the ceremony and the reception. Also, one of the lesser-known wedding hacks to save money: If you're having a band at your reception, ask about hiring one or two members for the ceremony.

[See Soloist Musicians](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/wedding-soloists-ensembles)

## 36\. Skip Wedding Favors or Select Inexpensive Ones

Forbes notes that many guests won't miss wedding favors, so you should feel free to skip them. And both wedding planner pros note that [edible wedding favors](https://www.theknot.com/content/edible-wedding-favors) are among some of the least expensive. Plus, you don't need to spend the extra cash to order custom, personalized favors. "Personalizing favors with tasteful details, like custom labels or handwritten notes, adds a special touch without significant expense," says Coyne.

[Find Favors You Favor](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/favors)

## 37\. Use Your Favors as Escort Cards

"Selecting favors that can double as place cards or be seamlessly incorporated into the table setting can enhance both your design and budget management," says Coyne. 

## 38\. Keep Transportation Utilitarian

Instead of renting a tricked-out stretch limo for your big day, opt for a six-person town car. Sure, all the bells and whistles make for a fun ride, but your main goal should be getting to and from your ceremony safely and on time.

[Find Your Ride](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/transportation)

## 39\. Prioritize What's Meaningful and Wow-Worthy

"Prioritize your budget by focusing on the most significant elements, such as the venue and high-quality photography, while being mindful of other areas where you can cut costs," says Coyne. 

## 40\. Stay Flexible and Creative

"The key to saving money on your wedding is being flexible and creative," says Forbes. "Don't be afraid to think outside the box when it comes to décor, venues and services. You can still have a beautiful, meaningful wedding without going overboard on spending."
