About this vendor

Your wedding day is all about you! Your collaborating vendors should arrive free of ego and ready to give you their very best. Over the last 15 years, I've shot and edited over 500 wedding films. What keeps this interesting for me is the incredibly rewarding challenge of keeping each film different (different in a good way) than all the ones before it. I'd love to develop a custom quote for your dream film. If you prefer to take a glance at our pre-made packages, check the website as they tend to fluctuate with the seasons. I'm trying my very best to give you the best at a price that doesn't kill your budget. Congratulations on your upcoming wedding!

Our wedding was exactly what my wife and I wanted it to be and we have a great video to remember it. We thought choosing a videographer was going to be hard. Wedlock Cinema was one...

of the first companies we contacted which was a lucky thing. Sean who seems to do most of the admin and shooting was really easy to deal with from the start. During the wedding day there was so much going on it was sometimes easy to forget we had a videographer which was ideal seeing how there's nothing less romantic than a camera in your face when you're trying to get married. The video itself is the best part. It's not boring like other wedding videos we had seen. There was lots of sections that we were too busy to notice during the day. The framing and camera work is really artistic but not in a way that takes away from what's going on. My brother is getting married next year and we already told them we'd be getting them a video as their gift. Looking forward to seeing you again, Sean.

ing worked with them, I can see why! They made the process fun, never clunky or awkward. We really weren't sure what we wanted in terms of style, but we knew we didn't want a long, traditional, boring video. What they gave us was something that cannot be described in words as it would do its uniqueness an injustice. We agree with our photographer that these guys are the best in the biz and we'll be recommending them to all of our friends!

My husband and I are both winos so we knew we wanted to get married in Napa but we didn't know whether we wanted to get a photographer, a videographer or both. We ended up getting ...

both and we're so glad we did! We had two shooters recording video which gave us a great deal of coverage. They used drones and stabilizers making sure that the footage was really clean and beautiful. They don't advertise multiple videographers on their packages but if you ask for it they will give it to you.

round on myself: I'm quiet. I like to do my own thing and associate with a few close friends. I was really so surprised by how comfortable I was being around our videographer. He was incredibly respectful of giving me space when I needed it but he never stopped working. The film ended up having so many hilarious and sweet bits we never would have seen without video. Plus, seeing things move with such beautiful color and crisp audio, it's like we get to do it all again. That's what we love about the video. We want to get married and have another wedding every day because of how perfect everything was. The video is the closest we can get to actually doing that.

My now husband is in the wedding industry so naturally we put a great deal of thought into picking out vendors. Working with Wedlock was among the very best of the decisions we mad...

e, exceeding every expectation at every opportunity. I can't express enough honest, genuine gratitude for Sean and his dedication. Within less than an hour into the day, we were at the point where we would have invited him to be a guest at our wedding, if he wasn't working for us! That's how much we enjoyed his personality and his presence! After about a month we received a beautiful, hand crafted, wooden box containing a decorative memory stick. I cannot tell you how creative and PERFECT our film is for us as a couple. The videos Sean has as samples on his website are great but I must say ours turned out better! I might be biased because my husband is in it, but it's truthfully very special and captivating. He is an artist of rare quality with a genuine wish to make people happy and that's exactly what he's done for us. - Wife I agree with her! Thanks a million to Wedlock Cinema! Hope to have the chance to work with you and catch up soon, Sean! Love your work! - Husband

Sean came highly recommended by the wedding coordinator at the venue my husband and I got married at. Video was really important to us so we shopped around. We ended up booking Sea...

n because we liked his style, specifically the way his previous films were edited. After having looked at many different videographers, it seemed like Sean was doing really unique things with color and sound design. When we first made contact through wedlockcinema.com, we got a prompt response. Unfortunately another couple was already in the process of working with Sean on our date. Discouraged, we continued shopping around. Lucky for us, about a week later we heard from Sean, saying the other couple decided to have their friend film for them. We all got coffee and talked about the timeline. At no point did anything feel salesy or awkward. The whole time, Sean seemed really relaxed and confident, like he had a plan. When the wedding day came, everything was beautiful. The day went by super fast but I kept noticing him getting all the little details, which I was glad to see in case I missed anything given the fast pace. When the sun started to set, the photographer and Sean worked well together, sharing every second. Sean asked my husband and I to do a few things that seemed a little odd at the time but made perfect sense when we got the video. We trusted him because it seemed like he knew what he was doing and it paid off! The shortest of the films we got is my favorite, as it is really, really detailed. It seems like a LOT went into putting it together both with the filming and the editing. Colors popped. Sounds were seemingly enhanced somehow and everything had this dreamy, romantic glow. My handsome husband looked more handsome than he normally does (and he's super handsome). I even looked pretty good! Basically, we had the best wedding day and we cannot recommend Wedlock Cinema enough to anyone looking for really unique, special, beautiful footage of themselves and their guests.

My wife and I hired Wedlock Cinema a year ago to film our wedding, although they were operating under a different name at the time. I wanted to take the time to come back and leave...

a review because they went out of the way to make our day as perfect as possible. My wife was stressed going into the day, but their professional and calm demeanor was a huge factor in lightening the mood. I've heard a lot of horror stories about videographers and photographers clashing in a battle for shots but these guys had no trouble sharing the space with our photographer. They shot our ceremony in 4k and some more fancy shots of my wife and I in super 8 (film!) per my request. This was important to me and the guy (can't remember his name) from Wedlock was a huge film nerd like me. We got the digital portion really quickly, like within a month and the film section took a few months. That's to be expected, as the chemicals to process this stuff are often hard to come by and then they have to scan each frame into a digital workflow. We got a 4k overscan of the super 8 image and it was beautiful. We now have a real timeless piece of art to remember our wedding and neither of us could be happier with the results. HIGHLY recommend them.

The work that these guys did was beyond anything any of us expected. We really liked the video samples on the website, so we decided to order the biggest package. This gave us two ...

days of filming. It was up to us what we wanted filmed on the first day. We decided to go to Bodie, the old ghost town and walk around. Sean and Russ (?) filmed us all dressed up walking through abandoned, western style buildings. Our wedding was western style, so we looked the part. I didn't know how it was going to turn out, but we're both really glad we set up this first day. The final edit was so cool. There's lots of dust coming off the ground as we walked toward each other. Think of a romantic spaghetti western. It was crazy! The wedding itself was at Longbranch Saloon. The footage from both days ended up going so well together. They brought a drone and a crazy camera stabilization machine to get beautiful flowing movement. My favorite part is this little scene they staged where I pretended to break my wife out of the old western jail. Hahah, it was the best! I highly recommend working with these guys! We shopped around a lot before choosing them, so we know what other people are charging. You definitely get what you pay for. I actually think it was a really good deal. I also highly recommend the "adventure" package. Do what we did and make a film somewhere special to you. Lots of the state parks and landmarks are closing or being vandalized. Having this footage to remember how things were is really special. To the camera people and editors: THANK YOU!

I originally wasn't planning on hiring a videographer but my wife really wanted one. We found Sean based on a recommendation of a cousin. Almost immediately, we had a Skype meeting...

and he seemed really in touch with how weddings play out. When the day arrived, Sean was really friendly and professional. He got along with all of the wedding party and he made me feel relaxed, cracking little jokes here and there to get us to smile for the video. When he filmed my dress, he brought a fancy hanger to replace the average one I had. It was little things like that, which really impressed me. We got our finished film two weeks after our wedding, way faster than the time-frame indicated in the contract! Nothing seemed rushed. There were so many carefully thought out moments where the camera was smoothly moving around, showing all the details we'd otherwise forget. The colors were stunning! We looked like we were in a professional movie, which is exactly what it was in a way. In the end, I was really glad we had video. Having the toasts recorded is really great and we'll look back on the film frequently. If you're unsure whether or not to have video at your wedding, I'd say do it. I've looked at other work done by local (I'm in Sebastopol, CA) wedding video companies and it seems rushed and boring. This is art and it is priceless! Sean, if you read this, thank you so much for giving us this great gift. We will cherish it always and wish you the very best with your film business.
