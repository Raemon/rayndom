I cannot recommend Tee & Rebecca Lambert Photography ENOUGH for capturing the most incredible moments of our wedding day. From the moment my husband discovered their website, he kn...

ew instantly they were the perfect choice for us. As someone who usually shies away from being in front of the camera, I was nervous about how our photos would turn out, and the overall process of being photographed. But Tee and Rebecca's warm personalities, and humor instantly put me at ease during our initial meeting. They took the time to understand exactly what we wanted and made us feel comfortable throughout the entire process. Despite some hiccups, on my end! (Family names on the paperwork being incorrect after no show’s, and lack of update from me.) Tee and Rebecca remained unfazed and incredibly accommodating. Their flexibility and professionalism during what could have been a stressful situation were truly commendable. The results speak for themselves—our wedding photos are absolutely breathtaking. I, personally, have never felt so confident and beautiful in pictures before. I've been so thrilled with their work that I keep purchasing more prints to put up in our home. If you're in search of photographers who not only deliver stunning photos but also provide a stress-free and enjoyable experience, look no further than Tee and Rebecca Lambert. I can only hope to work with them again for future milestones like maternity and family photos!

Talented, personable, friendly, funny, prompt, thoughtful, etc etc -- all words to describe just how amazing Tee and Rebecca are. I could go on and on about how they made our weddi...

ng smooth for us, a couple who didn't even know what they wanted! But trust, I can't imagine another duo working with us. My husband and I first met Tee and Rebecca during a tour of a venue. I remember being pleasantly surprised that they were from my hometown and were there on behalf of a couple planning to marry at the venue. Ever since that day and having our first Zoom call meeting, we knew we were in good hands. Tee and Rebecca care about you. They ask the right questions - questions about things I hadn't even considered important! They want to know any insecurities you have, what your desired look/vibe is, and they know how to respect that and deliver amazing results. While my husband is a freakin model, I am very insecure and very awkward in front of a camera. Tee and Rebecca directed me, in both a professional and friendly, easy-going way, so that I was (still feeling awkward haha) comfortable. They truly know how to make you feel at ease. There is so much to say about all the little things they surprise you with (special, unexpected deliveries in the mail :)!) And overall, they just make you feel like you're their only couple they're working with, they show up where you didn't think you needed them to, and their work is genuine, thoughtful, and beautiful. I could go on, but you'll have to book them yourself to see :) Ultimately, we couldn't imagine the days and months leading up to our wedding, especially the day of the wedding, without Tee and Rebecca. I swear our wedding wouldn't have gone as planned if it weren't for their professionalism and expertise. Sounds dramatic, but we stand by it! The moment they showed up while I was getting ready was the moment I felt like someone finally knew what they were doing and how to execute the scheduled plan :) They handled our stress and nerves so well...I was so impressed and thankful!! ALSO, my husband still talks about how calm, reassuring, and collected Tee and Jen (who came to assist on our big day as well and who was also a complete gem!) acted when my husband accidentally left his wedding shoes in a Lyft...he still talks about how thankful and impressed he was by their reassurance (and things did work out :)!) For anyone looking to book photographers who care about you, your big life event, and how to even help give assistance on planning your big day, book Tee and Rebecca. They are both absolute gems who just know what to do and when. We feel so lucky and blessed to have met them!! So grateful for you two!!!! Thank you!!

nd amazing to work with, and being a plus size bride I was very afraid of not liking any picture of myself. Man was I wrong! They capture their couples in just the perfect moments, showcasing how special and loving the day really is. Looking through just the sneak peek images my heart melts. With all that said, the support and gifts they give you throughout your relationship with them from booking to the big day and after is just unbelievable. This is the photographer couple of your dreams! Do not hesitate to book with them, it will be the best wedding decision you make beside the partner you want to marry!

Wedding planning was a big stressor for me and my husband. We didn't know what we wanted and we had no idea what went into planning a wedding. Tee and Rebecca made the entire weddi...

ng experience so much better. First, we were on a tight budget because we were getting married within a year. When we shared that with Tee and Rebecca they went over all of their packages and were very honest and transparent about their pricing. Right off the bat, we could tell they were an honest and professional team. Throughout our year of engagement, Tee and Rebecca sent us thoughtful gifts coupled with kind words and reminders. You could tell they really care about the couples they work with and love what they do. They helped us develop a timeline of our wedding day which helped us envision the day and also helped us communicate with other vendors since we didn't have a coordinator. From the beginning, they assured us and made it clear that they were there to work with what we wanted and envisioned. We expressed we didn't care too much about getting shots of the details of the wedding but instead wanted a lot of photos with our family and as a couple and they delivered. We loved their creativity and excitement! On the day of our wedding, it was so nice to have both of them by our side, encouraging us, reminding us of the importance of the day when things got a little too hectic, and keeping an eye out for us. For anyone having a Catholic wedding, Tee and Rebecca did great with staying "unseen" during the mass as requested by the Church but still getting beautiful photos. We would recommend Tee & Rebecca to anyone! They are professional, kind, caring, creative, and talented. We love our entire gallery!

Tee and Rebecca were the absolute best choice for photographing our wedding day. Since the first day we talked with them over the phone, we could tell how passionate they are about...

their work and their joy is infectious. The location for both our engagement photos and wedding itself was somewhere they had not yet photographed at, and they went above and beyond preparing to make sure things went off without a hitch. They are genuinely sweet, caring people and we cannot imagine anyone else making us feel as comfortable with such an important part of our special day. At the end of the night when we realized we hadn’t taken some photos we wanted, they went out of their way to try to make it happen before they left. And when we had some hiccups, they made the sweetest gesture to allow us to come down to their studio later that month to capture those details we missed. The memories they captured for us hold such a special place in our hearts, and we cannot wait to find excuses to use them again for future memories.

eting. We were instantly drawn to their light and airy style of photos, but their kindness and warmth sealed the deal. Throughout the wedding planning process, they were amazing at checking in and even sending thoughtful gifts. I felt completely comfortable telling them the things I wanted, they always made sure to deliver. We hired their services for an hour of the rehearsal dinner which they accommodated and allowed me to have even more memories. I think the most amazing thing was getting some edited photos from the ceremony DURING DINNER! I was able to leave the night with several gorgeous photos ready to go and post. As photographers, they are amazing. As people, equally amazing. Wedding days are wild and go by in the blink of an eye, by far my best choice was hiring Tee and Rebecca to help move the day along and take gorgeous photos I get to keep forever.

sed Tee Lambert Photography for our engagement and wedding photos, and the entire experience was like a dream. Starting with the engagement shoot Tee and Rebecca did a great job making sure we were comfortable as it was our first time taking professional photos. They listened to our desire to take photos near a beach, and recommended a great location. From there they made the experience feel fun and intimate. Tee and Rebecca made sure to check in with us a few times before the wedding to see if we needed help with anything, and also make sure that the day went as smoothly as possible by checking in about what our expectations were of them on the wedding day. On the wedding day Tee and Rebecca showed up on time, and started taking photos right away! They did a great job of capturing everything, but also never got in the way of any special moments. Tee and Rebecca also gave my husband and I some really thoughtful gifts during our engagement process, and I can’t even begin to explain how much this small touch meant to the both of us! I would absolutely recommend Tee and Rebecca to everyone! If we ever need a photographer again In the future we would absolutely use them again ❤️

I highly recommend Tee Lambert Photography, a 10/5 rating from all 3 of my experiences with them. For reference, I was the model for a wedding style shoot, then the other two sessions were mini sessions for my husbands bread business and my Beautycounter business. The pictures from those mini sessions were stunning! Perfect content photos for website, promos, and more! I can't rave enough about this duo!

Tee and Rebecca are also some of the kindest most accommodating and understanding people we have ever met. They sent us sweet gifts beforehand and got to know who we were. They were so understanding about all the little requests we had, and made sure to get a ton of shots we wanted in a short amount of time. To top it off they worked effortlessly in the 95 plus degree weather of our wedding day, their composure absolutely blew me away. I want to show everyone I know these pictures because I am just so impressed with their work. We cannot recommend them enough!

e a sense of community, not just competition. Tee and Rebecca are not only great to work with, they also create beautiful images that perfectly capture their clients. This couple is a power team and can tackle the grandest of weddings down to the most intimate of moments between two lovers. But they're not limited to just couples, they also do fantastic headshots and know how to capture families as they are. So if you want photographers who not only do great work but are also wonderful humans to hangout with, Tee and Rebecca are the photographers for you!

My husband and I have never felt like we were particularly photogenic or captured well on film — these two finally changed that! Receiving our gallery made me fully realize what a magical day our wedding was and I’m so grateful to Tee and Rebecca for going above and beyond and would work with them again in a heartbeat.

nd fun. From our first virtual meeting, Tee and Rebecca made it clear that our goal became their goal. From the consumer side, they have a well-run and organized business, with quick response times and a charming website. More than that, however, they are kind and friendly people, eager to learn your story and use it to shape the experience to one you will enjoy. Word of advice: if they say “This is going to feel weird, but it works - just trust us,” trust them. Those photos turned out to be some of our favorites! We wholeheartedly recommend Tee and Rebecca.

We’re not always the most comfortable in front of a camera, but they made taking pictures easier for us. Not to mention, the results were beautiful and I get so many compliments on them! Highly recommend these two for an awesome experience and quality photos!

professional photo shoot scheduled with Tee Lambert photography. Tee and Rebecca where wonderful to work with from the moment I reached out to schedule- to receiving the collection of beautiful photos. My husband and I have never had professional photos taken before. We had lots of questions and Rebecca kindly answered all of them and even provided us with a cheat sheet of photography tips like what to wear, props to bring, and time of day to capture the best lighting. As we have a newborn, I also shared my concerns regarding potential exposure to Covid. Tee and Rebecca wore face masks the entire time and Tee relied upon a long lens to provide extra distancing. I felt very safe the entire time. During the photo shoot we got to know Tee and Rebecca and them us. They made it extremely comfortable and fun for us. They where patient with a fussy baby and understanding when we needed a break to care for the baby! Yesterday we received the photos from our shoot. They are absolutely beautiful!! There are so many great shots, I can’t pick a favorite. I could tell they took time in touching up the images and even converted some to black and white. We love our collection and are so grateful Tee Photography was able to capture our first family photo!

ea. “If we can’t do weddings during this shelter-in-place, lets do families!” They were timely and professional, but more importantly, it felt like they had been our friends for a while. And we had just met them! They stayed more than ten feet away from us and still managed to make friends with our dog. I’m a dog trainer and I know that this is hard to do if a dog can’t do an official up close meeting with their photographer before they take the shoot. Did I mention that we love our family photo! I would highly recommend Tee and Rebecca for your wedding or family photo. Zippy Agrees too! Holly Uchida 4/16/20 MyK9sMind.com
