Stop searching for photographers - Hellena is your girl. My husband and I decided to get married and plan our wedding in 6 months. We were in a time crunch but wanted to get it ri...

ght! Looking for photographers on wedding wire, IG, the knot was easy but a lot of them felt too “cookie cutter” and basic. I found Hellena on IG under the tag “Latinaphotographer”. Although she was all the way in California, I knew I had to contact her and see what she was like. INSTANTLY, we clicked. Our FaceTime call was like talking to an old friend - dishing about wedding planning and our culture. She reassured me during the call that she would be our advocate: making sure we stayed on schedule, that we were focused on looking/feeling our best, that we got pictures of everything and with everyone we hoped to. Our follow up planning call was seamless: reviewing and revising our timeline (she gave great suggestions based on her experience), and must haves photo list. Hellena was so down to come to Chicago (granted our wedding was far from the city lol), and she braved the Midwest January winter weather like a champ! The moment we met on wedding day, she put my husband and I at ease. Hellena has this presence about her that makes you feel so comfortable. She is down to earth, smiley, charismatic, and effortlessly cool. She went above and beyond to ensure my husband and I had were enjoying the experience by checking in on us, bringing us drinks so we stayed hydrated, laughing with us. She even helped with bustling my dress! Hellena also has an eye for talent because the second shooter she brought along had amazing shots of my husband and his groomsmen. We recently received our gallery and we couldn’t be happier. Her photographs make us want to relive the day all over again. We loved all our portraits, candids, first dance and decor photos. She has made it difficult to decide which photos we need to frame for our living room because they are ALL SO AMAZING. We can’t wait to share our gallery with our close friends and family. Overall, Hellena was a highlight of our wedding day. It doesn’t matter where in the world you are located, take a chance on her. I’m so glad we took a chance on this beautiful human being and phenomenal photographer. She is making all Latinos proud with her work and character. Gracias Hellena for capturing the happiest and most magical day of our lives.

Hellena went above and beyond and made the experience of my wedding so much easier and as stress-free as a wedding can be for a DIY bride. There was a million things going on and her constant support and guidance made me feel like I was with a friend. With her directing me, not only did I feel comfortable in front of the camera, but was so happy with the results. I love our photos and am so thankful we made the investment in hiring Hellena. We are so happy with our choice and can't wait to book with her again for all of our life events in the future. I literally could not recommend her enough!

tell that she was the right person for us - down to earth, enthusiastic, easy to talk to, and kind enough to work with our budget and schedule. Hellena was on top of everything, making sure beforehand what kind of shots/vibe we’d like, and on our wedding day she had everything under control, going above and beyond for a stress-free and fun experience. As someone who is shy in front of the camera, she made my husband and I so comfortable, capturing exactly what I was hoping for and beyond! When i received the gallery, I was absolutely blown away. If you’re looking for a talented wedding photographer who will pay attention to the little things, please please book with Hellena! Thank you so much again!

m our initial introductory call over Zoom, we felt an immediate connection with Hellena - and were confident she'd be able to capture the moments most meaningful to us. In the months and weeks leading up to the wedding, Hellena provided recommendations and suggestions for how we could best structure our day, and was a critical voice in helping us finalize our day-of wedding schedule. The day of the event, she seamlessly became an organic part of our broader wedding party. She helped to ensure we stuck to our schedule, gave firm yet kind direction when coordinating all of the necessary photos, and immediately put us at ease. She created a sweet video reel for us and all of the photos she took were amazing. Her eye for timing, for serendipitous moments, and for special must-have shots was impeccable. We were very emotional when we looked through our wedding photos for the first time. I genuinely cannot share enough praise for Hellena.

From our group bridal party shots, to portraits, to candid dance floor moments, she caught everything. She’s a wonderful human, and we can’t recommend her enough.

oking for a photographer for our wedding, we wanted to find someone who could capture the looks we wanted but also keep the fun, party vibes our wedding was planned to be. From the first time she responded to our emails to the first time we spoke with her, we knew that she was the perfect photographer for us. Clear communication the whole time, willing to work with our schedule, super supportive of our personal lives. She even helped us find our videographer (@crossmyheartfilms). One of the biggest things that will stick with me was on our wedding day, she was there to fix my wife’s wedding dress more often than the MOH. Now that’s not a knock on our MOH —she was a fantastic MOH and an even better person — but an example of how much Hellena cares for you on your day, and how much of a perfectionist she is to capture the perfect shot as well. Lastly, her work! It’s simply amazing! It completely exemplifies the modern style of photography we wanted; focusing on natural light while catching those super important organic and candid shots. We knew we wanted Hellena based on her IG posts alone. We are so happy that we went with Hellena — a person who genuinely cares. In the videos I have of the dance floor, Hellena was right in the middle of it, smiling ear to ear while taking pictures of everyone. You can literally feel the love from her IG posts of her couples. We are so lucky and blessed that she was able to make it work with us. —— PS - we typed up the majority of this review on our honeymoon before we received our wedding gallery, so all of this is how we feel about Hellena strictly based on our interactions with her and a few sneaks. How fitting that on our final day, we received our full gallery and good lord, she did not have to go as hard as she did! What a perfect way to relive the day and cherish those moments for the rest of our lives. We are eternally grateful and so blessed to have the honor of working with Hellena. She will 1000% be our photographer for every occasion that comes up in the future.

8-hour rental with a million family permutations -- and she worked to strategize with us to make the most of it. On the day of, she took charge and made actionable suggestions which as a Type A bride who wanted to not GAF that day i LOVED. Numerous guests, unprompted, told me how much they loved her attitude -- that she'd step in and help take group selfies. And the photos! Warm, sweet, real: out in the garden mid-afternoon, at golden hour, on the dance floor, and in the dark church where the ceremony was held. She went above and beyond: when a guest had a medical incident, she was the one who called 911. Anyway, I could go on and on. Photos were so important to me and I'm so happy we worked with Hellena!

Leading up to the wedding, we checked in 1-2 times to review the timeline and photo list (and she gave us some excellent suggestions on both). On the wedding day, Hellena was punctual and an extremely calming and comforting presence. She made sure our needs as a couple were met (including making sure we were hydrated and well-fed) throughout the day. We received sneak peeks about a week after the wedding, and expect to get the rest in the next couple of weeks. Hellena is courteous, warm and very talented. She made our wedding extra special!

any type of photography you may need and would book her again in a heartbeat. You should book her too...ASAP. When it came to sourcing vendors for our wedding, we didn't really know much other than that we wanted to support LGBTQ / POC / woman-owned businesses/vendors wherever possible. After a fairly extensive and exhaustive search, we finally stumbled upon the website of the brilliant & talented #BOSSLatina, Ms. Hellena Cedeno. We immediately knew. She was the one. Between her photojournalistic style, uncanny ability to capture raw emotion, fine attention to detail, and unique point of view as an artist...she was everything we had hoped for (and more). Not only that, she made us feel incredible comfortable, confident, and supported throughout the entire process - from our initial zoom call to last call on the dance floor. Hellena - we can not thank you enough for being such an incredible partner (and friend) throughout the entire experience. And girl.

I cannot more highly recommend Hellena as a wedding photographer. From the first meeting I knew she was the right choice. She has been the perfect mix of professional and persona...

ble. I knew she would fit right in with our families. As an added bonus, on the day of, she jumped right into the role of coordinator, without even being asked. She kept us on schedule, helped us anticipate what would be needed in each moment, and liaised with our families and vendors. I was very impressed with her ability to learn our family and friends’ names throughout the event and she put us all at ease as we took both posed and candid photos. Her communication has been excellent, prompt and thorough. We recently got our photos back (two weeks after the wedding!) and I could not be happier with the results. She is very skilled and captured our beautiful little moments perfectly!

Working with Hellena was an absolute dream! What could have been a complicated stressful part of wedding was made so incredibly simple and wonderful. Before our event we setup a ...

meet and greet via zoom with Hellena where we covered some basics of what the day would entail and got to know each a bit. From the get go we knew she would be a great fit us. She is bubbly, fun with a great attitude, armed with a wide array of experience and professionalism! Hellena was also easily reach via email, text, or Instagram. Fast forward to the day of our wedding…she showed up early and was ready to begin photographing as we both got ready. We fit quite a bit in a four span; first looks, ceremony, both bridal parties, and reception photos and more! The best part of working with Hellena was her flexibility! She was willing to capture photos of anyone and anything we wanted on the fly while also adding in your professional opinion without being overbearing or taking full control of our photo sessions. By the end of our wedding we were all laughing so much! We didn’t just get a wedding photographer, but someone we can now call friend!

oved working with Hellena and I am so incredibly happy I found her! She was very responsive to my texts and understanding of my situation - my father is terminally ill and we had to make special accommodations, in order to have him share the day with us, which Hellena was more than willing to help me with and I was still able to get some photos with my father (that was very important to me). Hopefully one day soon we’ll be able to hire her for a maturity shoot - fingers crossed! 🥰

ion laughing. Walking back to the car and without even seeing the finished product we knew we wanted her do our wedding, thats how good she is. Since then she's quickly become our family photographer, doing our wedding, pregnancy announcements, maternity, and soon our first family photos. Couldn't recommend her more highly.

My now-husband and I decided to work with Hellena to photograph our wedding, and we are so thrilled that we did. She was remarkable to work with, and her photographs are amazing! W...

e HIGHLY recommend her. From the very beginning, Hellena was responsive, professional, and incredibly sweet. Even though she and I live on opposite sides of the state, Hellena was communicative and responsive, making sure that she understood our desires and concerns for our wedding day and that we were on the same page. She more-than delivered on all of her promises and took all of the photos we wanted, and they turned out beautifully. This is despite the fact that she had to work with our two large families, toddlers running around, older members with mobility difficulties, and family members running very late. All the while, she was friendly, thoughtful, and helpful. She thought of things we wouldn't have and made suggestions that turned out fantastically. She even helped me move some boxes that the caterer had left lying around! Ultimately, she was wonderful, and I would absolutely work with her again.

new that it would be such a breeze to work with her! She has a very warm, gracious and fun personality which is just what you need for a photographer. She made everyone feel comfortable taking pics especially when we requested to have a huge photo with everyone in our guest list. She absolutely captured the best moments of the most special and happiest day of our lives! The pictures came out perfect and every time we look at them, it’s like we were back in that very same moment. We will definitely be having Hellena as our photographer for all our future events! Thanks for such an awesome experience, Hellena! :)
