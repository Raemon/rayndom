y situation and for picking up the work right where I had left off. She is hilarious, down to earth, and was fun to work with. Not only did she keep me laughing and keep my stress levels down throughout the planning process, she brought that energy into the day before and day of the wedding to help me have as close to a perfect day as I could imagine. I can't picture my wedding day without her! She goes above and beyond on the small details and personal touches to make your day unique. She takes the time to get to know you, makes sure you feel seen and heard, and makes sure your wedding vision comes to life. Hiring Jenell is one of the best decisions I made for my wedding and I would recommend her to anyone lucky enough to be getting married in an area she travels to! Thank you Jenell! We love you!

From day one, Jenell was caring, thoughtful, and invested in making our wedding perfect. She was by our side every step of the way. Jenell helped us with landing on the right desig...

n choices and she gave amazing vendor recommendations. She even found us an outstanding last-minute caterer who was still within budget and even better than what we had hoped for! Jenell helped us bring our design vision to life and made sure nothing was missed. She had the perfect decor pieces in her collection to fit with our theme and style. We can’t recommend Jenell enough. She wasn’t just a planner, she was a true partner who helped us bring everything together seamlessly, from the DJ to the food, to the decor, to even the bartenders. Thank you so much, Jenell! Our day was everything we hoped for! All the best, K&S

Wildflower Event Company was hired last minute for an elopement on 11.11.23. The owner took it upon herself to take care of this challenge that fell through someone else’s hands...

with no warning. Her personality alone clicked with us so well. She is perfect! She amazed both myself and my husband. We felt so relaxed and was able to enjoy the whole process leading to our wedding and the day of! She was able to put my wedding together in 3 weeks time AND put together my wedding ceremony site and my 2 reception sites which was 20 minutes down a mountain! She stayed with us even afterwards and joined us for the whole thing to ensure EVERYTHING went smooth! And the Jacobs’ wedding day was MAGICAL! From initially just needing help with an elopement, she was walked me through all the little things to let me see all the possibilities we can do in our time frame of a day and the planning time we had. We made the MOST of it. And both my husband and I couldn’t have been any happier!!!!! Our guests were in awe. The best thing about the wedding, was that it was a beautiful reflection of myself and my groom! EVERY DETAIL of our wedding showcased both of us. It’s all thanks to Wildflower Event Company!

We could not have been more thrilled with Jenell and her incredible team! Jenell listened to our ideas and did everything in her power to bring them to life. She got to know us as ...

friends, which went a long way towards staying true to our summer camp wedding vision. We felt comfortable being honest with her and look forward to hanging out, even after the event is done! The Wildflower Events Co. team was so committed to perfection, that they were up and prepping our wedding at 6am on the day of the event. They painstakingly set up a gorgeous outdoor reception, and jumped into action when the rain threatened to ruin our day. They moved everything indoors seamlessly and got soaked in the process. Even through all of this, they kept our happiness at the front of their minds and bent over backwards to ensure that we had a perfect day. Jenell also had a number of rental items that she graciously allowed us to use, and even went as far as to iron linens in her room the night before the ceremony. She truly went the extra mile(s) to make sure that everything was perfect. I wish I were having another wedding or event, just so I could hire this amazing team again!

ny large event. She was always weeks ahead on planning and gave me all information so I felt that it was not being forgotten. She is so thought out in her planning process, every detail was shared with me through checklists and inspo pictures. She had communication with all my other vendors so i did not have to worry about catching 7-10 people up. She was great at communicating and I always received a text or email back within hours. I could not recommend mywildflowerevents more, thank you so much for taking care of everything and helping me have the most stress free wedding!

of the stress off of our shoulders with set-up, decorations, dealing with vendors, guests, etc. so that we could enjoy our day. Jenell has a wonderful eye for decor and attention to detail and the tables and venue looked absolutely stunning! I know that couldn't have been possible without her! There were several important items and details that I had forgotten to do and even though it was last minute she took control and handled it for me. From the dessert table labels and signs that she printed up and framed herself, to the napkins that she folded to perfection. I felt like she cared about my wedding day as though it was her wedding day! Her support and help throughout the whole process was invaluable and she really made our day more special than we could have ever imagined.
