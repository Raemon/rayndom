I really wanted to love the Kissel Hotel as our wedding hotel block — it’s a beautiful, new, centrally located property — but my experience trying to book with them was frustrating...

and disappointing. From the beginning, they refused to speak over the phone and required all communication to happen by email. That might have been fine if responses were timely and thorough, but many of my questions went unanswered, and when replies did come, they often took days. I was passed around to three different representatives over the span of a week, which made the process even more confusing. I was prepared to spend over $5,000 on a room block plus the presidential suite, yet I often felt like they didn’t even want my business. To make matters worse, one representative made an inappropriate and unprofessional comment implying I was probably pregnant because we were booking our wedding “so soon” — not only incorrect, but an offensive assumption. Despite these issues, I was still willing to book because the hotel itself is gorgeous. Unfortunately, at the very last minute I was told they couldn’t fulfill our request for rooms with two beds (tip: there's 10 total in the hotel, and they book fast!), which was the final dealbreaker. The hotel may be beautiful, but couples should be prepared for slow, inconsistent, and at times unprofessional communication.
