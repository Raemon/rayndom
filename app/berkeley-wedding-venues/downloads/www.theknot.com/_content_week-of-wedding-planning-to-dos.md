## What To Do the Week of Your Wedding

If you're counting down the days before your wedding, there are a few things you'll need to add to your agenda. In addition to marking off all those items, don't forget to relax and have fun. Yes, you might feel stressed, but finding moments of joy amid the mayhem will make the planning experience all the more worthwhile. 

FEATURED VIDEO FROM THE KNOT

### 1\. Create a Wedding-Day Timeline

Work with your planner and/or venue coordinator to create a minute-by-minute timeline of your entire wedding weekend, from first thing in the morning until the last vendor leaves. A well-thought-out [wedding timeline](https://www.theknot.com/content/sample-wedding-weekend-timelines) will clear up any confusion, and ensure that all of your VIPs are where they need to be at the right times. Once your timeline is ready to go, share it with all of your vendors, wedding party members and close family so that everyone is on the same page. 

### 2\. Overcommunicate With Your Vendors

To make sure everyone is on the same page (so they don't need to call you or your point people on the day-of) call every single [wedding vendor](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace) and [confirm, then re-confirm each arrangement](https://www.theknot.com/content/last-minute-questions-to-ask-wedding-vendors) you have with them, including, but not limited to:

### Find all the vendors you need

Discover top-rated pros for any budget, background and style.

  * Giving the reception site/caterer a [final headcount](https://www.theknot.com/content/when-should-we-give-the-wedding-caterer-our-head-count). Include vendors, such as the photographer or band members, who will expect a meal. Ask how many extra plates the caterer will prepare.
  * Supplying the location manager with a list of vendor requests such as a table for the DJ or setup space needed by the florist.
  * Giving the [ceremony](https://www.theknot.com/content/ceremony-contract-points) and [reception](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-reception-venue-contract) site managers a schedule of vendor delivery and setup times, plus contact numbers.
  * Calling the limousine or car rental company for pickup times and locations.



### 3\. Designate Your Various Point People

You don't want your caterer calling you while you're getting your makeup done on the day of. To avoid that, designate point people for every situation, including:

  * Ceremony items: If you're having a unity candle, combining sand, jumping the broom or breaking a glass during your "I dos," have one of your attendants make sure all items are at the altar ahead of time.
  * Money: Write checks and/or talk to the wedding hosts (usually your parents) about any final balances to be paid at the end of the reception. Also, arrange [tips and gratuities](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-vendor-tipping-cheat-sheet) for your vendors and decide who will give them out. 
  * Reception questions: Introduce your reception site manager to your consultant or maid of honor for questions or problems during the reception.
  * Miscellaneous questions: Provide all wedding professionals with an emergency phone number to call on the day of the wedding—usually your planner, maid of honor or bridesmaid.



### 4\. Take the Time to Pack Properly

This is going to be the one occasion where you probably should care deeply about what's in your suitcase. Whether you're getting married five minutes down the street or you're leaving for your [honeymoon](https://www.theknot.com/content/2017-hottest-honeymoon-destinations) a day after the reception, taking the time to pack thoughtfully for each event that week is crucial. (We know all too well what happens when you wake up at 5 a.m. to pack with bleary eyes! Mismatched bathing suits and missing deodorant, anyone?) Do you have your [wedding-day emergency kit](https://www.theknot.com/content/your-wedding-day-bridal-beauty-kit)? Your wedding-night attire that was gifted to you at your shower? Your day-of present and note to your partner? Knowing you have everything you need will definitely minimize any stress.

### 5\. Schedule Any Beauty Appointments

Your fingers will likely be texting all week, which makes it even more crucial to keep your nails fresh. Make any minor beauty or grooming appointments you want done that week. Think: a mani-pedi, waxing, massage, blowout, facial, etc. Any experimental beauty treatments (like facial peels, lasering, hair coloring and drastic cuts) should be done a few months in advance, just in case they don't turn out as expected.

### 6\. Arrange Help for Any Guests Who Need It

If you have any ill or elderly guests coming to your wedding, it will be meaningful for them to know you're so glad they can attend. Show your love by making sure they have proper [transportation](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-transportation-planning-basics) to and from the airport and your wedding events and that they have a comfortable place to stay. You can ask family members, friends or attendants to help with any pick-ups and drop-offs.

### 7\. Hand Off Important Items 

Getting married also means having a lot of important things to distribute among your family and attendants.

  * Give your [marriage license](https://www.theknot.com/content/marriage-license-basics) to your officiant.
  * Present attendants with gifts at the rehearsal dinner.
  * Present parents and each other with gifts.
  * Give wedding bands to the best man and the maid of honor to hold during the ceremony.
  * Give the best man the officiant's fee envelope to be handed off after the ceremony.
  * Hand off place cards, table cards, menus, favors and any other items for setting the tables to the caterer and/or reception site manager.



### 8\. Have Your Wedding Attire Ready to Go

Make arrangements at your bridal salon or local cleaners to have your wedding attire steamed—and don't try it on after it's been steamed or else it'll wrinkle again. Store it in a garment bag and hang it in a closet in a smoke-free and pet-free room. (If you're wearing a wedding dress, you can lift the skirt out of the bag—just make sure to put a clean sheet on the ground below it first.) If you've rented or purchased tuxes or suits from a retailer, have a family member or attendant pick them up. 

### 9\. Deliver Welcome Baskets

Whether it's you or an attendant, deliver your [welcome baskets](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-welcome-bag) for guests to the hotel concierge. Make a list of names, delivery instructions and any additional information you have to prevent any mix-ups.

## Frequently Asked Questions About Wedding Week

If you've got last-minute questions, we've got answers. 

### What should I eat the week of my wedding?

Eating healthy is a must during your wedding week. Avoid skipping meals or stress eating, as it won't do you any favors. Eat regular, balanced meals with fruits, veggies and lean protein, such as fish, along with healthy fats like avocados.

### How many days before your wedding should you take off of work?

Many couples agree that at least three to four days is a good amount of time to take off before your wedding day. It gives you plenty of time to mark off the items on your week of wedding checklist, in addition to providing you with space to relax, welcome guests from out of town and attend any last-minute appointments.

### Do I need to do a final venue walkthrough?

Many couples do a final walkthrough of their venue about a month before their wedding day. At the final walkthrough, you'll ask any last-minute questions and make sure everyone is on the same page as you plan your wedding-day timeline. Usually, your wedding planner will attend with you, and other vendors may join as well.
