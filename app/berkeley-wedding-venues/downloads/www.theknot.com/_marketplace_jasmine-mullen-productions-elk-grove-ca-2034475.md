Jasmine Mullen

Owner

I got started in the wedding business by doing it for a few friends. I realized watching other wedding videographers that it's just as important to capture special moments as it is to GIVE people their special moments. My biggest goal as a videographer is to simply have you remember those special moments and the feelings that came with them—not to remember the special moment with a giant camera next to your face. I love filling my weekends with weddings and will gladly devote the time and attention your wedding deserves.

energy radiates and you can see it in our video. She even took the time to ask if we wanted any edits to the final product after we received it, she truly made sure it was everything we could dream of for our video. We are forever grateful for the magnificent piece of art she created that is our wedding video and can’t thank her enough. Still looking for a videographer? Look no further because Jasmine is the only choice you need to consider!

able to capture the best day of my life, and she did it so perfectly. Jasmine made me feel so beautiful on my wedding day. Jasmine is a dream to work with. She is absolutely brilliant in so many different ways. Her attention to detail in everything was phenomenal. Throughout our wedding video she was able to capture the essence of our wedding from the atmosphere to the emotions, she was able to shoot every detail that I felt was important. She was awesome to communicate with. If I had any questions for her she would always get back to me very quickly. Jasmine’s communication with our other vendors for our wedding was spectacular. Jasmine worked harmoniously with our DJ and our photographer. Jasmine brought all the good vibes. I am immensely grateful for her and her hard work and would recommend her to anyone in a heartbeat. Jasmine is remarkable. I hope everyone gets the pleasure to work with her at least once in their lives.

She honestly delivered what I think is the best wedding video ever of all time and paid attention to all of the details that were extremely important to us.

I cannot say enough wonderful things about Jasmine!!!! I went back and forth so many times about whether I wanted a videographer or not and I AM SO GLAD WE DECIDED TO HAVE ONE!!!!!...

Truly worth every penny. Jasmine showed up right as the nerves were setting in and immediately felt like a friend I’ve known for a long time. She blended so seamlessly into all of our big moments throughout the day that we didn’t even notice she was there, capturing our memories. When we saw the final product my husband and I both bawled our eyes out. It was perfect and captured our day in such a beautiful, raw, candid way. If I have any advice for you on your big day, it’s to not only hire a videographer but to specifically hire Jasmine. She made our day that much more special and I’m so grateful we had her!!!
