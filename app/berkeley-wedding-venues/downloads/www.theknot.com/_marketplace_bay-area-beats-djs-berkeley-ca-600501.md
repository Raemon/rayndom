reaching out to us to get to know our taste in music to ensure the best playlist for our event. We had a smaller, untraditional lunch after our ceremony, and he did a great job playing our favorites during cocktail and lunch portion of the day.

We worked with Adrian from Bay Area Beats. Adrian was amazing in responsiveness throughout the process - making sure he got back to us within a few hours each time we reached out ...

via email. We had a wedding with people from many different countries attending and wanted a good mix of Indie pop for the cocktail and dinner at our wedding and a mix of American pop/hip hop + Bollywood + reggaeton for the party after dinner. Adrian did a phenomenal job covering and smoothly transitioning between all 3 - using the music to both get people onto the dance floor and keep them there. Adrian also did a really good job balancing requests from our guests while making sure to keep everyone entertained and playing our favorite songs.

We were planning on working with Adrian, and we had exchanged several emails and a call working out the details. We had come to an understanding, and he sent me the contract on Mon...

day while I was at work. When I got home and was preparing to send the deposit that same Monday evening, I received an email saying that he had booked another job for our date. The reason given was that the other event is located in a more convenient location. I was surprised, and disappointed in this business.

This is my first ever negative review ever since launching my business in 2012. After 100...

\+ five star reviews & a few 4.5 stars, this hurts as its up on the top & what new clients see. Please let me explain. The other couple had reached out about the same time & were on the fence. They called begging me to book them as they loved all my reviews. I realized it was only 1 mile from my house in Oakland, 4hrs less drive time to your remote venue in Felton, 2 hrs less DJ time, and even a bit more pay. What would you have done? I had no signed contract or deposit with you yet so nothing was set in stone. Us busy DJs get 2-4 inquiries a day & book out 6-12mths in advance. Yours was 3 months in advance so I realized before taking the other wedding I would find you a great other DJ that is free that date, which I quickly did. Please try to understand why it made sense for me to accept the other couples offer. Maybe you could forgive me & erase this negative review that puts a dent in my business, even know what I did was completely legitimate in the business given we had no binding contract....

Look no further - you just found your DJ. Picking Adrian to be our wedding DJ was an absolute no-brainer. He was immediately responsive to our inquiry, took time to call my (now) ...

wife to answer questions we had, and was extremely accommodating from start to finish. We got married at my parents' house, so it made for not a typical venue setup. Adrian took what we had and make it work perfectly. I don't think a lot of DJs would do that, let alone even consider DJ'ing with that kind of environment! He put us at ease from the first time we talked, he communicated with us between that call and the day of, he even kept me calm leading up to the Big Moment! He greeted us with a smile and worked seamlessly with our planner. My wife and I had come up with a list of songs that we wanted to hear. Adrian was gracious in playing our ENTIRE list. He was great at transitioning between songs at the ceremony and reception. He has an eye for seeing that people are not too into a song and gradually faded to a new song before the "lame" one finished.

a DJ. Despite that, we immediately knew that Adrian is a top pick: he is accommodating, experienced, a professional, and offers great value. The entire wedding party and guests were very happy with Adrian's skills. He was able to ask the correct questions ahead of time and was always in communication. Even better, during the wedding he was able to provide insight and knew how to stay away but take direction when things changed.

t he also complimented it with his music list. He was able to set outside for the ceremony and moved the equipment inside for the reception. More than anything else, he was personable to work with and the lighting was very classy and soft as well. We asked him for some special affects and he was able to provide that for a little extra charge. It was well worth it. The corporate DJs are a bunch of marketing with no personal touch; however Adrian provided the personal touch with all the amenities. I would highly recommend him.
