deo of our dreams! We watched it four times in a row the day we received it. It’s that incredible. We reached out to Elpis Weddings with less than a week before our wedding, and they pulled everything together seamlessly. Their hard work and professionalism are unmatched, and they were such a joy to have with us on our big day! Our wedding day involved three locations, 12 hours of filming, and 130 guests, yet Oz and Berk captured it all with such skill and artistry. The highlight reel they created is stunning, with a perfect mix of emotion, beauty, and storytelling. I can’t recommend Elpis Weddings enough to anyone looking for a team that not only makes you feel completely comfortable but also brings an artistic flair to their work. Thank you, Elpis Weddings, for giving us a video we’ll cherish forever!

Rachel and I couldn’t be happier with the wedding film that Oz and Elpis Weddings created for us. We’ve been together since high school, and our wedding day in 2023 felt like the c...

ulmination of so many years of love and growth. Having our ceremony in a beautiful Foreign Cinema made it even more special—it was like a perfect tribute to our story. We realized we hadn’t written a review when Oz kindly reached out to us, and we’re so glad to finally share how much this video means to us. From the very beginning, Oz and the team were incredible. They captured everything in such a genuine and thoughtful way, from the small moments like Rachel laughing with her bridesmaids to the overwhelming joy we felt walking out together as husband and wife. The film truly feels like us. It’s cinematic yet so personal—it brings tears to our eyes every time we watch it (and trust me, we’ve watched it a lot, especially on our anniversaries). The way Oz combined the stunning shots of Mission st. with our emotional moments was beyond what we could’ve imagined. To anyone considering Elpis Weddings, we can’t recommend them enough. They don’t just create wedding videos—they craft memories you’ll treasure for a lifetime. Thank you, Oz, for preserving the most important day of our lives in such a beautiful way. It’s a gift we’ll cherish forever.

Elpis Weddings team brought such a clear vision to life, and their attention to detail was nothing short of amazing. Posing as the bride in this shoot was effortless because the entire team created such a relaxed and inspiring atmosphere. Oz was incredible behind the camera—guiding us with so much care and making sure every shot felt natural and full of emotion. The way they captured the story of Meley and Valentino on the beach is truly breathtaking. The final video is stunning! Watching it felt like stepping into a romance novel, with every moment beautifully framed and brought to life against the gorgeous backdrop of Miami Beach. It’s a testament to the incredible talent of everyone involved, from Valentina’s flawless makeup and hair to Massielle’s dreamy floral arrangements. Thank you, Oz and the entire team, for creating something so magical and for letting me be part of it. This project was more than just a shoot—it was a celebration of artistry, love, and storytelling at its finest. If you’re thinking about working with Elpis Weddings, you’re in the best hands!

've hoped for. From the start, Oz and the team were so warm and easy to talk to. It felt like they weren't just there to do a job, they really cared about making sure our day was captured perfectly. On the wedding day, they blended right in, making us laugh and feel totally comfortable in front of the camera. And the film? Wow. We were blown away. They didn't just record the day; they told our story. Watching it, we could feel every emotion all over again-the love, the laughter, even the little nervous moments we had before the ceremony. They even captured details we didn't notice in the moment, like the way the sunlight hit the flowers in the garden or how Ashley's dress moved as she walked. Elpis Weddings truly has a gift for making everything look as beautiful as it feels. We can't thank them enough for giving us something so special to look back on. If you're thinking about hiring them, don't even hesitate. They'll take care of you like friends and create something you'll treasure forever. Thank you, Oz and the team-you guys are the best.

scovering a hidden gem. Right from our initial consultation, it was clear that they weren’t just here to document our day; they wanted to be a part of it. Working with Elpis Weddings felt less like hiring a vendor and more like gaining a friend and storyteller. Oz took the time to understand our personalities, our quirks, and the nuances of our relationship. This personal touch translated into a wedding video that wasn’t just a visual record but a genuine representation of who we are as a couple. Their passion for storytelling made the entire experience feel intimate and special. On the wedding day, Oz seamlessly navigated the chaos, capturing moments that were pure and unfiltered. Their ability to be everywhere without being intrusive was a testament to their professionalism.

If you’re seeking a videographer who becomes a friend and a storyteller, look no further. Elpis Weddings is the one who will turn your wedding memories into a beautifully crafted tale.

and now i have a beautiful wedding video that I can cherish and keep forever. Their professionalism and eye for detail was a nice relief as the day of the wedding can be so hectic anyway.

They captured a very sweet moment with me and my parents. I am forever grateful for their hard work. 100% all the way!

They are passionate about what they do and go out of their way to create a work of art. I was in tears watching our special day back and I guarantee you will be too.

Where to start? This was purely a last minute decision that we were thankful we made! We originally didn’t have videography in mind but we couldn’t resist once we saw their videos ...

and reviews not to mention the price! This was easily the best decision we made. The team was wonderful! They were professional but at the same time relaxed and made everyone feel comfortable, it’s like their goal was to blend in the crowed, which they did very well. Our hope was to have a genuine, fun wedding (non of the rehearsed, posing or planned feel) and Elpiswedsings gave us exactly that. We had an initial meeting with ozgen and Serkan where we were asked all the right questions to get a feel of what we’d like to see, after that meeting we felt very confident hiring them to shoot our wedding. On the wedding day they showed up ahead of schedule and pretty much stayed with us the entire night; the best part is we didn’t feel “watched” because they made us feel very comfortable during the photo shoot and were stealth during the wedding, which made us feel very relaxed and allowed us to be ourselves! Once we received the video, we couldn’t believe it, they captured exactly what our wedding was all about and we couldn’t help but smile every time we watched the highlights video. Their style of story telling was implacable, truly! It reflected exactly how we felt that day and every time we watched that video with a big smile on our faces it was like reliving the best day of our lives! I am very thankful to have stumbled up elpisweddings and I can’t stress enough on how highly I would recommend them.

but I felt that Elpis really fit the bill. They were such a pleasure to work with, they were genuinely kind and got to know us as a couple and were also professional.

We love our videos and all the details they captured, it really feels like we're reliving our wedding day.

o hire them. In hindsight, I'm so happy we did. Everyone tells you that you're wedding day is going to be a blur. I had no idea how true that was until it happened! By the end of our wedding night, my husband and I had no recollection of anything that had happened. Luckily, we had Elpis Weddings record the whole thing! :) A couple months before our wedding, Oz and Serkan drove out to meet us in person in San Jose. They met us at our favorite sports bar, and my husband and I explained what our vision was for our wedding. They were the only wedding vendor to take the time to meet with us and actually hear what we wanted! I also appreciated that they drove all the way from San Francisco, just to get to know us! On the day of our wedding, Serkan and Oz arrived early to scout the property and take some shots of the location. I was so happy that there was two of them! Serkan was able to get some shots of my husband getting ready, while Oz stayed with me and my girls. They also stayed until the very end of the night. Our wedding video is absolutely gorgeous. In fact, many of our friends who are getting married in 2022 are now hiring a videographer, simply after seeing the beautiful video that Elpis Weddings put together for us. Overall, I HIGHLY recommend Elpis Weddings. They were so kind, easy to work with, and made our day completely stress-free. They were also extremely reasonably priced for the quality of their work. Thank you so much for everything, Oz and Serkan!!!

ing activities, no in-person reception, or first dance, or people partying on the dance floor. So we decided to live stream our wedding to our friends and family via Zoom. 35Video re-worked our package deal and instead provided live stream services for our wedding. We didnt have to do a thing. They coordinated the whole production, and used their equipment to clearly stream us visually and audibly to our online guests with very minimal glitches or hiccups. They were so flexible in working with us and making a change from videographing our wedding, to live streaming it instead. They also threw in a bonus 1 minute video, that captured our day so perfectly with all its sweet moments, beautiful lighting and visuals from the gorgeous view from the mountain top venue, to the heartwarming gazes, kisses, and hugs from the Bride and Groom with their little 2.5 year old as well. The video may be short, but it was PERFECT and memorable. If I had the opportunity to hold a longer and more vibrant wedding with all my loved ones outside of COVID, I would definitely use 35Video to capture the night and recommend them to anyone looking to have the heart of their wedding captured on video. Thank you Tugrul and his team!

During the phone call I was surprised when Tugrul said that he had gone to check out the venue beforehand, showing a strong commitment to excellence. The day of, Tugrul & his team showed up on time, & were great to work with, getting in all the shots they needed without being overly intrusive. I love the final results of the videos, the styling is beautiful, & everyone who's seen it is impressed. My brother who's a photography geek was very impressed with Tugrul & his team's equipment, & said that even the drone that he used was very new. Overall I feel like I lucked out by taking a chance & booking 35Video when they don't have as many reviews as other established videographers, but ended up with amazing videos to capture my wedding day.

iveness. As this was a surprise we had to coordinate to ensure we were aligned on timing and location. Tugrul made himself available one week prior and went to the site with me to help me pick a spot that would capture the best pictures and videos. As we approached the date we saw the weather would not be cooperating on the decided day so Tugrul was able to move things around and accommodate me one day earlier. The day of the proposal the weather started to change; Tugrul texted me and let me know that they may not be able to use the drone but would do their best. Despite the high winds and slight rain that could damage the equipment Tugrul still managed to have the drone up to capture this important milestone in my life. I was very pleased with the service, 35video went above and beyond and I will be using them for another shoot prior to the wedding.

er. It simply wouldn’t have been the same. Everyone that has watched the video is highly impressed. They made everything so easy, and I felt very reassured that my special day was in very good hands.

They way the told the story is better than I could’ve ever dream of. Thank you so much.
