Bride’s Perspective Our wedding at the Los Altos History Museum was a candlelit garden pizza party—relaxed, romantic, and full of laughter. About 80 of our favorite people joined u...

s for a night that felt casual and fun yet still elegant and special. We held our ceremony under the big tree near the entrance, with short rows of chairs so we could actually see everyone’s faces as we walked in and out. During cocktail hour, guests (especially families with kids) loved the docent-led tours of the historic house. For dinner, everyone sat together at two long banquet tables on the brick patio, and when the sun set, candles and string lights created the most beautiful golden glow. As the night went on, we moved inside for dancing. Guests who stayed outside gathered around the heaters and cozied up with the blankets we’d provided. Because the garden is already so gorgeous, we kept the décor simple with some DIY TJ's flowers & candles. One of my favorite memories was cutting the cake at the end of the tables and seeing all our guests chatting and laughing in the candlelight. The weather ended up chillier than expected for mid-October, but propane heaters worked well & made the night feel extra cozy. We live nearby and got ready at home, which turned out to be comfortable and stress-free. Before planning, I thought I wanted a rustic barn and my husband wanted something more elegant. The museum was the perfect blend — and better than either of us imagined. Lisa, the venue coordinator, was a joy to work with. She’s organized, calm, and incredibly professional. From our first walkthrough through the final cleanup, she made everything seamless. I trusted her completely and felt supported. We still joke that if we ever got married again, we’d do it all exactly the same way — same space, same vendors. Groom’s Perspective We knew right away that the Los Altos History Museum was the place for us. Lisa not only runs a beautiful venue but also keeps everything straightforward and stress-free with fair policies and transparent pricing. That gave us the freedom to make the day completely our own. The space flowed naturally — ceremony under the trees, cocktails by the house, dinner on the bricks, dancing inside. It felt hidden & private but still easy for guests to reach. The gardens were perfect for photos. Watching the sun set over dinner while candles and string lights began to glow was pure magic. Lisa was outstanding — responsive, flexible, and helpful. She met with vendors beforehand, made space for us to store supplies, and was the first to arrive and last to leave. She even helped pack our car at the end of the night! A few practical notes for other couples: there’s limited getting-ready space (we used our house, which worked well), tenting for rain can be pricey, and there’s no commercial kitchen onsite. None of this was an issue for us because Lisa communicated everything early, and her guidance made planning easy.

Ian and all of your guests soak in all of the things you planned. The dream team came together from a vendor perspective and we all had so much fun supporting a day celebrating the two of you. Your wedding was my last event of the year and I am so happy to have ended the year with your day as the finale! From end to end, everyone was smiling, laughing, and sharing in the celebration of two amazing people coming together. I am forever thankful that you popped into my inbox over a year ago, knowing from that moment that we were on to something. Thank you for allowing me to be even a small part of your wonderful memory filler day.

seamlessly with our vendors to ensure the day ran smoothly, and her knowledge of wedding best practices and attention to detail were incredible. The museum itself is both beautiful and functional— the ability to flip the ceremony space into the reception while our guests enjoyed cocktail hour in the back of the same property made for an easy, enjoyable guest experience (and renting the tables and chairs from the museum made the planning also easy for us!). The twinkly lights over the lush greenery created a lovely backdrop, and our guests also loved the opportunity to check out the museum a bit too! With Lisa's guidance and enthusiasm, we were able to create an event that was stunning, unique and effortless for our guests, and an incredible value! We couldn't have asked for a better venue or better partner (again, s/o Lisa!) in planning our special day

The museum wedding coordinator Lisa was responsive, accommodating, knowledgeable, and had lots of great suggestions to make the day flow smoothly. They also let us store supplies at the venue the week leading up to the wedding which was very helpful. The bathrooms are the weakest part of this venue. They're clean but not the nicest and a little hard to find for guests. On the whole a great venue and made for a really special day. Would recommend!

We had a blast hosting our wedding reception here. Lisa was very helpful from the very first day where she toured the grounds with us, answered all of our questions, and helped us ...

make the right decision. Throughought the process Lisa communicated with us and updated us as the day got closer. The week of, she was very attentive, very helpful, and accommodating, all of which are very helpful as the day approaches. On the day of, she was there, all the way to the end of the wedding, which was very nice. So many things are happening that day, and knowing she was working hard in the background, did not go unnoticed!! She helped keep our evening running smoothly and allowed us to enjoy the night. I would HIGHLY recommend this venue for anyone looking for a venue. It is a beautiful place, that honestly doesn't need much decor as the foliage and setting speak for themselves. Thank you Lisa and LAHM for making our night one that we will never forget!

We were married at the Los Altos History Museum on a Sunday evening in June, 2025. The venue was perfect, with gardens in bloom, a beautiful courtyard, plenty of space for cocktai...

l hour, dinner, dancing, and so many great sites for photographs around the Museum grounds and exhibits. We had the museum at the top of a short list before we went to visit, hoping for an outdoor venue for a wedding with a family reunion feel. We were blending a large multi-generational family with roots on the East and West Coasts, and the museum grounds feel like a perfect blend of New England and California summertime, with a brick courtyard, large heritage oaks, and historic buildings. The secret gift in booking the venue, though, was Lisa Porter, the Museum’s Event Coordinator. Lisa was responsive, professional, knowledgeable about every detail we could think of, and had so much helpful advice at every step of the planning process. She worked exceptionally well with our vendors and made it easy for them to get information and support whenever they needed it. She was present through rehearsal and event; she told us when we first met that she would be the first person to arrive and the last person to leave, available for whatever might come up. It was just beautiful at night; perfect for a summer evening wedding, and the “golden hour” glow is gorgeous in the photos. We held cocktail hour, dinner, toasts, and first dances outside, then moved the dance party indoors. We had 150 guests; there was plenty of space for everyone who wanted to dance, and the weather at night was still comfortable outside between dances for talking and mingling. We are so glad we had our wedding at LAHM; the setting was perfect, and Lisa made sure our plans came together just right.

When we'd finally decided on the placement to be facing you, as you walked down the aisle, it seemed like it had been the plan all along. I find that your event in totality followed a similar energy. Everyone there was being held by each other, by your love with Alex, and all of those not able to be physically there. I will remember your humor and grace, even when you lost your voice, and how lucky you two were to have found each other. Please, don't be a stranger!

Our event had a few moving parts, including a scavenger hunt, full catering for breakfast and lunch, and even a magician/mentalist — and the space handled it all seamlessly. The amenities were super convenient too. We had a shuttle drop off team members, and those who drove had no issues finding parking. Lisa was amazing to work with. She was responsive, helpful, and incredibly accommodating — from the early setup to coordinating all the logistics. Our team had a great time, and the smooth transition between indoor and outdoor spaces made the whole experience feel effortless. We also selected Heirloom from their approved vendor list, and the combination was smoother than I could have even dreamed! Would definitely recommend for events — both personal and corporate!

front of their large oak tree, reception in the open courtyard, and cocktail area in between those two. The venue was large enough to have events in different sections of the property (ceremony, cocktail hours, reception, dance floor, photobooth, dessert/coffee area, etc.) throughout the night while accommodating our 140 guests without feeling cramped, but still had the cozy feel. There is so much greenery around the property that photos from all angles turned out beautifully. Additionally, though the space is open, the sun was never an issue for us or our guests. Lisa from LAHM was so easy to work with, clear with instructions, and responsive/patient with any questions I had throughout the planning process all the way to the day of the wedding.

We recently held our wedding reception at the Los Altos History Museum, and it was truly PERFECT! The venue itself is simply gorgeous. We started out with cocktail hour in a beaut...

iful shady area of the property where guests could mingle and enjoy the beautiful landscape & architecture. Our reception was held on the main patio, which was spacious & allowed us to very comfortably host almost 200 guests. The bistro lighting, surrounding trees, barn-like buildings, & pergolas made the space so romantic - with the natural beauty of the venue, no additional florals were needed. There is also a perfectly sized indoor area for dancing. On top of that, the venue offers a ton of flexibility - we were able to bring food trucks & food stands to the venue, and there are few venues in the Bay Area that would allow that! The location itself is ideal. Parking is plentiful; and while the museum is very close to downtown Los Altos and I280, it feels so isolated & private - perfect for a wedding reception! The secret to hosting the perfect event at Los Altos History Museum is LisaP, the event planner at the museum. Lisa is AMAZING - she is incredibly responsive, so organized, and has a true "can do" mindset. From the start, it was clear that she was committed to helping us make our vision for our wedding reception come true! We were taking an unconventional approach by bringing food trucks & food stalls to LAHM - and Lisa helped us brainstorm ideas & ways to make everything work. She answered all of our questions promptly, and with such a positive attitude - we couldn't have pulled off our reception without the help of Lisa! The Los Altos History Museum is a true gem & the ideal venue for wedding reception or any special event. We highly recommend it for any event where you want to wow guests in a beautiful & romantic setting - your guests will be impressed, and you'll get the benefit of working with a true event planning wiz in Lisa!

I don't say this lightly, but this was certainly an event to remember. Everything fell into place perfectly, the staff was having fun, the guests were thrilled...it was everything we'd talked about. I hope that the photos of this event bring you back over the years and that you won't be a stranger to LAHM. We welcome you back any time.

etting. Lisa was super helpful and accommodating. Really beautiful courtyard and garden space, it gave us the cozy backyard feeling without the hassle of actually planning something at home. The museum exhibits were also very charming. They offered more flexibility than other big wedding venues, though there is still a list of preferred vendors. The terms were pretty transparent - no big hoops to jump through or navigate. Spacious parking, just keep in mind time constraints for your event. Overall, we loved having our wedding here and would recommend!

I recently had the pleasure of working at LAHM as a wedding planner since my couple had chosen to get married here. The venue itself is absolutely beautiful, filled with flowers & ...

greenery, string lighting already installed (which can be expensive if brought in!), and a rich history that adds a special touch to any event. The multiple spaces available allowed guests to explore and enjoy different areas throughout the day, making the whole experience feel dynamic and unique! On the day of the wedding, we needed to do a flip of the ceremony space into a dining area, and the venue's setup allowed us to have the tables ready & set up inside during the ceremony, which was incredibly helpful and made the transition smooth. The venue manager, Lisa, was great as well—she was easy to communicate with and extremely helpful throughout the planning process as well as on the day of the wedding. She knows the venue inside out and was able to answer all questions & provide helpful suggestions. I enjoyed working with her and would highly recommend LAHM as an event/wedding venue!

you and the couple. They were so lucky to have you, you made the day run super smoothly and everyone knew their part. Couldn't ask for more from a wedding planner! Looking forward to working together in the future.

In every way, LAHM was the absolute perfect wedding venue for us. Magically good. First — the people. Lisa, the events director, was so great to work with and put us at ease righ...

t away, from getting us scheduled instantly for the first tour (six months from our date!) to communicating clearly & excellently throughout. The second time we were there she was finishing up an appointment and (no surprise!) the other folks couldn’t say enough nice things about her. She was so key as the point person to get everything running smoothly. Second — the venue is really ideal for a wedding ceremony and reception. Cute, cozy, and private, with lots of flowers and very light touch needed on any additional decor. The area in the back with a few tall trees made for stunning golden hour photos. It was one of those places where you can walk in and just instantly feel, “this is it” — and that’s how it was for us. Our guests loved it, too! We had a ton of glowing comments about our choice of venue. That made us so happy. Third — it was practical. From their extensive experience with hosting events like this (& recommended vendor lists) to their convenient location (nestled right in near downtown Los Altos and easy to get to; also, copious parking)…it made it very easy to focus on everything else that goes into planning. Everything went *so* smoothly, not a single hitch, and that is not something to be taken for granted. Finally! Though this is a wedding venue review, the museum is also a wonderful community space with exhibits and kid-friendly activities. We went several times during the planning and it always felt like a friendly place to visit. Thank you so much to Lisa, and everyone at LAHM, for forever being a part of our unforgettably special day. <3

The LAHM is such a sweet, beautiful and lush venue, tucked away in Los Altos! They have a gorgeous red brick patio with lights already strung across to make any event feel like mod...

erate sized garden party. For our wedding, we loved having a beautiful natural backdrop for our ceremony, but also a space with room for mingling during cocktail hour and for kids to run around (though if you have a kids free wedding, the event space is still perfect!). They were so generous in allowing us to use the Smith House for the bride to hide away while guests arrived, while also giving us space in their main museum to store the belongings of our wedding party. All around, I couldn't imagine a better wedding venue for us! Lisa P. started after we had reserved our date and once she was our point of contact, things couldn't have been easier! She was so helpful and communicative. We even lost one small item on the day of the wedding and she was so diligent in ensuring it was returned to us quickly and easily. We highly recommend the Los Altos History Museum for your event!

lexible catering (Asian cuisine), and beautiful scenery. Los Altos History Museum fit the bill and so much more! The venue coordinator, Mark, is such a pleasure to work with. He is very easy-going, super responsive, and helpful! Helpful tip: You can put a hold on a date without putting down a deposit. This way, you can go home and think about it or do a few more searches at other venues. Not many venues do this!! There are different set-ups you can do with the space and you do not need many decorations, as the venue is already beautiful with the string lights and greens. Mark offers many insights on this as well. We're so glad we chose to have our wedding at Los Altos History Museum. Such an amazing venue - highly recommend!

Loved having our wedding at The Los Altos History Museum. Very intimate, romantic, and comfortable setting. The string lights and abundance of natural greenery and florals sold us....

Mark was an absolute pleasure to work with. He’d seriously be the best PM to work with anywhere he was. Couldn’t ask for anything more. The LAHM books up fast so book quickly! We booked their last availability for the year a few weeks into the beginning of the year itself!

ave the ceremony and reception all in one spot. Mark, the event coordinator, was amazing to work with and answered all of my questions quickly and gave us plenty or suggestions when we weren't sure about things, like timing and layout etc. The LAHM needs very little decor since it's a garden and has so much charm already, which made my life so easy! Really all we did was add floral arrangements to the tables and created a backdrop for the ceremony and that was the perfect amount. We used a caterer off the preferred vendor list (Catering by Dana/Absolute BBQ) and I highly recommend going that route. The food was AMAZING and their coordinator and staff know the venue inside and out, so everything ran very smoothly. I highly recommend the LAHM for a wedding! We got nothing but compliments from guests about how perfect the space was, and I would have another event there in a heartbeat!
