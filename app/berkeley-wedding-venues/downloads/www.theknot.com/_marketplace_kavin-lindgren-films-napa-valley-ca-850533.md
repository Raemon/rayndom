We could not recommend Kavin Lindgren Films any more highly! From start to finish Kavin has been so easy to communicate with, responds quickly and is so enthusiastic, kind, genuine...

and positive. From our first conversation I had so much confidence in Kavin and his team which was so reassuring and put me at ease on our wedding day. Exactly the way I was hoping to feel! Our videographer did an incredible job. He was so kind, so excited for us and had a calm confidence about him. He and our photographer worked so well together and honestly I never felt like I was being videotaped or uncomfortable in anyway. Our video turned out better than we could have dreamed! It is the perfect representation of the best day of our lives! There is something so special and real about having video footage and seeing the laughter, hugging, facial expressions and all the love that was in the air. Kavin did an amazing job of coordinating the video with the music and he lets you choose what songs you would like which is really special and not something that most companies do. He also added moments from our vows and the speeches from our wedding which made it so much more meaningful. We are so grateful to have this wonderful video to watch, reminisce on and cherish forever. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts!

I'm the girl that has been watching wedding videos since the first time people started publishing them on the internet. I would day dream about how one day mine would be and what m...

usic would play in the background. So when it was finally time to start planning my wedding one of the first things I did was go on my hunt for the perfect wedding videographer. Kavin's style was exactly what I was looking for and so I decided to trust him with this important task of capturing mine and my husbands big day. HE. DID. NOT. DISAPPOINT. When I tell you there about 900 views on our wedding video and half of them were probably me. Every time I watch it, it's like living it all over again. I'm the bride I once envied and awed over. Each moment Kavin captured was beautiful and true and the way he was able to edit it all together is magic. We are both SO SO SO happy we booked Kavin Lindgren Films!

We continue to watch our beautiful wedding video every year because it's so magical, thanks to Kavin. He had such a personal approach, and really captured the most amazing moments ...

If you’re thinking about hiring Kavin, you definitely should. The video he made of my wedding day I will forever cherish, he captured the most beautiful moments of my life and made...

an amazing compilation of the day. Aside from the beautiful work he does, he was very professional but also really friendly and made us feel comfortable being ourselves in front of the camera. I will always be thankful we decided to do a wedding video, something I will be showing my kids and my grandkids one day.

We could not recommend Kavin more! Kavin and his wife made the most amazing team to capture our big day :) They caught every single special moment in such a natural and effortless ...

way! It was hard to even tell them apart from our wedding guests... they blended in seamlessly, made the day so fun, and you can really see that in the footage. Kavin asked lots of questions about how we wanted our wedding video to be structured, what kind of music, what kind of voice overs, etc, so the final product was really bespoke and perfect for us. We absolutely love our wedding video... it is timeless and so professional! We also so appreciated all of the raw footage he shared, and had so much fun watching it all back. Look no further for an amazing videographer!

Where do I begin. I was lucky enough to have Kavin and his amazing wife Ali fly out to my wedding in Virginia as a videographer/photographer team. I was afraid to even ask them to ...

travel, but they had already become like family and are so passionate about their clients and work that they made it feel like a small request. I have a group of 7 best friends, the first of us to get married hired Kavin and when the rest of us met him at the wedding we knew he'd be a lifetime addition to our group. Each of us who has been married since have hired Kavin and have had an equally incredible experiences. Kavin and his wife have such a calm, and genuine demeanor, which helped really set the tone for the big day. My husband and I are not naturally great in front of the camera, but they easily got us laughing and feeling comfortable and we actually had fun taking photos/videos for literally the first time in our lives. They helped us capture every special moment of the day, and somehow made it feel easy, quick, and natural. They were super communicative throughout the planning process, produced the final product very quickly-in fact delivered it on my birthday, and we were blown away. Look no further, Kavin is your man if you want a smooth perfect day thats captured on video. I watch the video short he put together over and over. I have absolutely nothing negative to say about Kavin, Ali, or their work, everything was perfect!
