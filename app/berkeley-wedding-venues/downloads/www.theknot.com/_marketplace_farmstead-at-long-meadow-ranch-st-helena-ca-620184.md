Our guests kept raving about the food, and the beautiful, scenic outdoor area.

Our day was beautiful and better than we could have ever imagined, however only thanks to the landscape and beautiful site, not the venue/business itself. Their communication was v...

ery poor, they do not provide enough staff for a large wedding, and the final month added a large amount of stress on me and my planners because of their lack of communication and slow finalization of details. I would not recommend the venue for a wedding larger than 75 people. The apple orchard was the site we used for our ceremony with 125 guests. That space is not sufficient for that amount of guests, however they did not share any capacity restriction so we assumed it would fit. The ceremony set up was cramped, several guests chairs were positioned completely behind trees with ZERO view of the front of the ceremony space. I wish someone had just been honest with us about the number of people that space would realistically accommodate. Additionally, I would not recommend the "family style" meals. Our guests were not served proper portions, everyone had to ask staff several times for the main dish to be delivered, including the bride and groom and our families head table, since it only was handed to a few tables and not consistent. The bartender also had no barback and the entire bar was left unattended at several occasions, making my guests wonder if they were to serve themselves cocktails. The venue points of contact were very slow when trying to contact them through both email and phone during the planning process and did not make planning on my end easy. The underwhelming service and disappointment of these details did not reach our expectations and was no where near equivalent to what we paid for.

dating to our requests. The outdoor lawn was the perfect size for both cocktail hour and seated dinner for 160 guests. Food was spectacular as always. S'mores bonfire at the end of the night was also a huge hit. I will say, in the final month the communication between the event team and us and our planner was frustratingly slow. The Farmstead team was very understaffed for the volume of work and inquiries they were dealing with. Despite the lag in response, we felt like they made up for it in accommodating our requests.

e extremely slow to respond and often bounced questions back and forth between them or even left questions unanswered. One of the coordinators stopped working on weddings about a month before our wedding and didn’t think to tell us. They also did not show up for our rehearsal walk through and “forgot” to mention the cost for post-wedding clean up. We were charged an additional $1,300 for flower petals that we left at the ceremony site, even though the wedding party attempted to clean them. The lack of communication was appalling and they didn’t send the final contract until one week before the wedding. They also didn’t follow our timeline for the day leaving vendors unfed for longer than agreed upon and bringing out food to guests later than we had decided resulting in a significant change to our timeline. While our wedding was wonderful I would suggest that any couple moving forward with this venue be aware of the terrible communication and get a capable planner to act as your communication liaison between the coordinators on site—just to save yourself from any additional stress.

When we first began wedding planning, we identified that the top two most important components to our wedding were: 1. The food had to knock our socks off, and 2. If you blindfolde...

d us and dropped us at our venue, we wanted it to feel very obviously Northern Californian. Farmstead at Long Meadow Ranch checked off both of these boxes for us! Because they have a highly regarded restaurant on site whose menu overlaps almost entirely with the menu you choose from for the cocktail hour and reception, we knew the quality of their farm-to-table style dishes would be amazing (and they were!). Farmstead and its surroundings have a real natural beauty, so we kept our decor to a minimum and let the cozy space speak for itself. We loved that the reception was able to run until a later time than other venues in the area allow. Our guests could not stop raving about the level of attentiveness of the staff/servers and bragging that their glasses were never empty though they rarely visited the bar. One of our concerns when we first signed on with Farmstead was the street noise during the ceremony but it turned out to be negligible during our ceremony. The only hiccup we had that we weren't too happy about (but were able to recover from) was that - some of the plants on the pergola we had our ceremony under had succumbed to disease and died off. The puffy, greenery with little flowers we had seen time and time again was looking very sad on one side, which made us sad because it was one of our favorite parts to having our wedding at Farmstead. We understand nature runs it course and can't always be controlled, but we would have appreciated notification. We found this out on our own two months before the wedding when we happened to be in the area and swung by for a visit, and unfortunately, we ended up having to pay our florist unplanned expenses to cover up the metal wiring that was showing through pretty prominently. Farmstead hosts many events and has a very experienced team and set offerings, so they know how to put on weddings like clockwork! This was largely positive for us especially because we did not have to source as many vendors as a typical wedding would need, but at times, we also found that there was less flexibility with options and policies. It was also occasionally evident that we were competing with other events for the team's attention. All in all, I would still have my wedding at Farmstead at LMR if I did it all over again in St. Helena!

Even when we were thought we had to come up with contingency plans for both rain and significantly cooler weather, they worked with us. They were super accommodating as we brought in some of our wine, outdoor games etc. I already loved Farmstead from my many visits over the past few years, but having our wedding there with the beautiful scenery and delicious food made me fall in love more.

As we all know, wedding planning is no small feat! We worked with Rebecca and her team and they are some of the nicest and most helpful people you can find in the wedding planning ...

industry. My husband and I got so lucky with booking Farmstead for our wedding venue because everyone at Farmstead was so responsive, professional, they answered all of our questions and concerns, and they seriously made the planning process a lot more manageable than we anticipated, especially with a wedding as large as ours (220 guests)! The events team is so organized; they were on top of all the wedding details such as chairs, tables, linens, menus, dinner and cocktail hour layouts, and they also worked with our vendors to make sure their equipment can be accomodated! Farmstead has such a beautiful venue as well, so we did not have to worry much about decorating the place. The lawn has beautiful string lights above the dinner tables and a beautiful surrounding garden, it didn't feel like we were next to the busy Main Street! Not to mention the food!!! We had such a great menu tasting it was difficult to choose between the dishes, we ended up upgrading our dinner package to include the Pork Loin and an additional side! Our guests did pretty good damage to the food as we did not have too much left over. Everything flew by so quickly on the day of. The execution team was so quick and efficient when flipping the lawn from ceremony to reception, the place looked perfect! It wasn't until we sat down for dinner that we realized that everything had gone so smoothly, we didn't even think of worrying about any details that may have slipped through the cracks. I'm a little sad that our wedding is over now, but could not be happier with the results from working and planning with Farmstead. It truly has been a delight working with Rebecca and her team, they really made the process a smooth one, as well as pleasureable! We had the wedding of our dreams, and more! Thank you, Farmstead, for all your hardwork and giving us the most amazing and unforgettable wedding day!

The ambiance is wonderful! Elizabeth and her events staff are pros and make everything flow smoothly. Yes, as other reviewers have noted, the 20% service charge is applied to every...

thing, and after taxes have been applied, but I think that's actually a pretty common industry thing to do. Elizabeth sent us a revised proposal with every update/change, and when we got the final bill after the wedding we found a mistake that she remedied right away and was super apologetic for. The food is seriously delicious, and since it's served family style no one complained about still being hungry at the end! We used their included desserts, which people raved about and thought was better than boring wedding cake, and we had a cutting cake that they didn't charge us anything to use their utensils to cut (it didn't get served, just packed back up to take home). Overall, it was the wedding reception of my dreams. I couldn't have found a more perfect "rustic, but clean and functional" location. The staff was amazing!!!!

. Their professionalism and attention to detail is second to none. We were even pleasantly surprised with details throughout the evening that we didn't even realize were included in our proposal. The food was AMAZING! Not "wedding food" amazing but one of the best meals my wife and I have ever had. The outdoor Venue was immaculate, even after receiving a ton of rain days prior. Flexible, fair, responsive, fun, I can not jam enough adjectives in to this review to tell you how great the experience at LMR was. Above anything else it's really was the staff and service that made everything so insanely perfect. These are some of the greatest folks I ever had the chance to work with and have serve us on our wedding day. We were introduced to everyone, even the amazing chef that prepared our meal. LMR and Farmstead really made us feel like family. We plan on spending many anniversaries with the great people at LMR and can not wait to go back. Have your wedding here!

Farmstead at Long Meadow Ranch is an amazing outdoor venue for a wedding. The one negative is their proximity to Highway 29. This is the main road connecting the towns in the Na...

pa Valley, so there is a considerable amount of traffic (particularly on weekends when most weddings take place). You can hear the noise of the traffic during the ceremony and reception. And if you're lucky, like us, you can hear someone shout "Don't do it!" from the window of a passing car during the ceremony. We chose Farmstead because they have both an outdoor space and indoor space, which we thought would be great to have in the case of inclement weather. Word of warning - if rain is forecast on your wedding day, Farmstead will require you to get a tent for the lawn. This should be in their new contract, so make sure to review it carefully. It was not in our contract, and we were told three days before our wedding that we would have to pay for a rented tent that would cost us almost $5,000 (after rental cost, 20% service charge, taxes). They do not allow smaller tents that use stakes, so your only option is a large, structural tent. We were very fortunate that it didn't rain and we were able to have the wedding and reception outside without a tent. Guests got to play bocce ball during the cocktail hour and the "Live Fire" dinner option was a huge hit. The food is fabulous at Farmstead. I was thrilled with the make-your-own s'mores option for dessert and guests loved roasting their own marshmallows over the bonfires. Farmstead has two indoor spaces - a small 'Potting Shed' and a larger room they call the Barn. The Potting Shed was the perfect space for the girls to touch up hair and makeup before the ceremony. We also used it for childcare during the event. It was great for parents to be able to bring their kids, drop them off with the babysitting service, and enjoy the event knowing they could look in on their children at any time. Farmstead even gave us options for children's meals at $10 each for kids under 8. We thought the barn would be the perfect place for the DJ and dancing. If you have a rustic theme, you can use it as it is but it can also be decorated easily. One caveat if you are looking at booking Farmstead at Long Meadow Ranch for your wedding - read the contract thoroughly and ask for an itemized breakdown of the expenses. Elizabeth was great about explaining everything to me and breaking down the costs after we received the final bill, but it would have been better to receive that with every new proposal so I could see what each item cost. The proposals don't have the rental cost on them, so on the final bill I saw charges I had never seen (for example, renting the Potting Shed for childcare cost $500). The final bill won't have things itemized, so you'll see a charge for $6,000 for facility fees but won't know what charges that covers. This is the only venue I came across that will add a 20% service charge to everything. It adds up, so be aware of that cost. In the end, I felt a bit nickel-and-dimed. I was told that if I used their bakery, Perfect Endings, the cake cutting fee would be waived. But because I ordered directly from Perfect Endings (instead of Farmstead, which meant they couldn’t make their extra 20%) Farmstead charged me $5/slice for cake cutting. Service at the event was wonderful.
