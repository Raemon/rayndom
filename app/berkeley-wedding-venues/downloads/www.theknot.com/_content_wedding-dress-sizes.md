There's no denying that the world of wedding dress sizes can be a confusing one. It's unlike any other shopping experience you've had before. Not only does bridal sizing differ from the fit of your everyday clothes, but sizing can also vary from designer to designer. We know—it's a lot.

Ultimately, you should feel confident and beautiful in your skin, and you shouldn't let a number or tag define your worth or how much you deserve to be celebrated on your wedding day. To help you better understand how wedding dress sizing works, especially to those who may be shopping for [wedding dresses online](https://www.theknot.com/content/virtual-shopping-guidelines-wedding-attire), we spoke with Brittany Bergeron, Operations Coordinator at [The Bridal Finery](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/the-bridal-finery-winter-park-fl-1071149) in Orlando, Florida. Ahead, she's helping us break down everything you need to know about bridal sizing before you book your dress appointment.

### At a Glance

  * Bridal sizing runs about two to three sizes larger than regular street clothing.
  * Bridal dress sizes differ from designer to designer. You should reference a designer's unique bridal gown sizing chart before purchasing a wedding dress from them.
  * The most accurate way to determine your wedding dress size is by taking your measurements at home or at a bridal salon, then comparing them to the designer's wedding dress sizes chart.
  * Bridal salons generally only carry a few sample sizes for try-on appointments. Sample sizes usually range from a bridal size 6 to 10, but you can call each salon in advance to see what sizes they carry.
  * While referencing a designer's bridal dress size chart is an important step to getting the best fit, you'll likely still need alterations to ensure your gown is just right for your wedding day.

## Are Wedding Dress Sizes Different From Regular Dress Sizes?

Yes, wedding dress sizing is different from regular street sizing. "Wedding dress sizes differ by running about three sizes larger than regular dress sizes," says Bergeron. "This means that a bride who wears a size 12 in the mall would be around a bridal size 18."

According to Bergeron, the method is quite outdated. In fact, bridal sizing is actually based on traditional European sizing from the 1940s. That's why sometimes your dress size will match your pant size and other times it will differ. "Bridal designers and dressmakers are generally accustomed to pattern making from the past, making it relatively difficult and time-consuming to transfer over to modern day sizing," Bergeron says.

## What to Know About Wedding Dress Sizing Before You Shop

Now that we've covered the difference between wedding gown sizes and streetwear sizes, there are a few more things to cover before you start [trying on wedding dresses](https://www.theknot.com/content/top-dress-shopping-secrets). From sample sizes to alterations, here's the lowdown on all the other wedding dress sizing must-knows.

[Find Bridal Salons Near You](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/bridal-salons)

### Check Your Bridal Salon's Sample Size Availability in Advance

"Before attending your [wedding dress appointment](https://www.theknot.com/content/questions-to-ask-bridal-consultant), call your bridal salon and ask what sample sizes they have available for you to try on at their shop," Bergeron says. "Bridal sample sizes generally range from a bridal size 6 to 10, which typically translates to a street size 2 to 6."

### Ask Your Wedding Dress Boutique About Size Charts

"[Wedding dress designers](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-to-find-wedding-dress-designer-you-love), especially those who specialize in custom made-to-order gowns, frequently have their own sizing charts," Bergeron tells us. "This means that bridal sizing often differs even further than typical bridal sizes." So, don't be alarmed if you are a size 12 in one wedding dress designer and a size 14 in another—this is completely normal.

### Expect That Your Dress Will Still Likely Require Alterations

Based on your measurements and the dress designer you choose, Bergeron tells us that your stylist will help you determine which size to order. Once your dress arrives, you'll need to start thinking about [wedding dress alterations](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-gown-alterations-101). "Every wedding dress requires alterations, even if it is a custom made-to-order gown," Bergeron says. "This is to ensure that your wedding dress will be altered to fit perfectly on your wedding day." (Psst: Don't forget to factor your predicted [wedding dress alterations cost](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-dress-alterations-cost) into your dress budget.)

## What Size Wedding Dress Am I?

If you're visiting a bridal salon, your stylist will take your measurements so they can order your dress according to the designer's wedding dress size guide. If you're shopping for your [wedding dress online](https://www.theknot.com/content/virtual-shopping-guidelines-wedding-attire), check out our guide on [how to take your own dress measurements](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-to-take-dress-measurements-at-home). Once measured, be sure to write down your numbers so you can align them with the wedding dress size charts below to help find the best fit for you.

## Wedding Dress Size Chart Guides

Wedding dress sizing is difficult enough. To make it a bit easier, we've rounded up a list of wedding dress size charts from a range of popular wedding dress designers. Don't see your favorite designer listed? Don't fret—this is where "sample sizes" come into play. Some designers are completely custom and don't have a size chart at all, so your dress will be made based on your measurements after you try on a sample size in-store or at a bridal salon.

### How to Read a Bridal Size Chart

There's a good chance you aren't tracking your body measurements and height on a daily basis. Wondering where your natural waist is? Is the "length" measurement the same as your height? (Spoiler alert: It's not.) Use this handy wedding dress size chart guide to ensure you have each measurement area covered.

## Bridal Sizes FAQ

Still have questions about wedding dress size charts? Read on for more info, from alterations pointers to tips for plus-size shoppers.

### How many sizes can a wedding dress be taken in?

Typically, a wedding dress can be altered two sizes down while still keeping the integrity of the gown's construction.

### How many sizes can a wedding dress be let out?

A wedding dress can only be let out by one size. However, if you need to go up several dress sizes, your seamstress may be able to add a lace-up corset back or gusset for a comfortable fit.

### When should I get my wedding dress altered?

You should head to your [wedding dress fitting](https://www.theknot.com/content/final-details-wedding-fittings) no later than three months prior to the wedding. This allows plenty of time for two to three fittings to ensure your dress fits like a glove.

### What do bridal sizes mean for midsize and plus-size shoppers?

We won't sugarcoat it: Shopping as a plus-size or midsize bride can be stressful. Midsize brides may find that they just _slightly_ size out of a designer, and other times, sample sizes don't accommodate curvy or plus-size brides. However, we've been thrilled to see designers and salons offering more size-inclusive options for brides of all shapes and sizes. "There are now more bridal boutiques than ever before that have options for every bride's individual needs," Bergeron tells us. To avoid any surprises, contact potential bridal shops in advance to see how and if they can accommodate brides who aren't within the sample size range.

"Depending on the gown and the bride, some bridal stylists are able to provide special undergarments or clip the wedding dress on the bride's body without fully zipping the dress to help provide a visual of what the dress will look like in the correct size," she tells us. "If you are not a visualizer and it's important for you to see the dress on your body with no clips, pins or modifications, there are bridal boutiques that specialize in a wide range of bridal sizes."

If you fall in love with a specific wedding dress or wedding designer, don't let a lack of sample sizes deter you from booking your appointment. "Staying open minded to adjustments, pinning and modifications throughout your bridal appointment will help you envision your wedding day look as well as ensure you find your perfect dress," says Bergeron.

Before you start booking appointments, do some research on the [plus-size wedding dress designers](https://www.theknot.com/content/finding-a-plus-sized-wedding-gown) brides have been loving. We also recommend taking a peek at our list of recommended [plus-size bridal shops](https://www.theknot.com/content/plus-size-bridal-shops) in your area and stopping by a few that pique your interest.
