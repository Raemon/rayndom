Where do I begin? Chef AK is uniquely talented. Talk about tender loving care? Well, she is the very epitome of it! My daughter recently got married in Saratoga, CA. I planned ...

the wedding from Louisville, KY. From the very beginning, vendors were shooting us down. Either the date was unavailable, or our small wedding was not enough $$$$ or people for them. When we found Check AK, she not only worked with us on the menu, she helped with linen vendors and flowers. This was not her responsibility! She saw me getting pushback from the venue and stepped up to help—what a fantastic person. Not to mention the FOOD!!!! OHHHH, THE FOOD. When she laid out the first plate...It disappeared! Well prepared and full of flavor! She did this without having a kitchen to prepare it! As a seasoned hospitality professional, I can honestly say Eat and Play events, they know how to cater. She knows people and how to take care of them. As the bride's mother, I had so much to worry about on my plate; Chef AK grounded me and told me: " Don't you worry, We got this!" What a comfort. If you are looking for a professional chef that can cook and interact with people, Eat and Play events is your caterer! I will be forever indebted to Chef AK for making my daughter's wedding a beautiful, stress-free, and unforgettable event! From the bottom of my heart, Thank you.

How lucky we were! A friend of mine recommended Chef AK and Eat Play Events to cater our wedding reception and they knocked it out of the park! We ordered appetizers for around 50 ...

people, these included meat, seafood, vegetarian and vegan options. All were delicious, and the grilled shrimp and empanadas were exceptional. They worked with us to make sure we received exactly what we wanted. Everything was delivered on time, well organized and presented. They even included utensils, plates and napkins as a courtesy. Their prices are more than fair for the quality of the ingredients, the preparation and cheerful courtesy that we were shown. I would not hesitate to use them again for stand up or sit down affairs. You will get friendly, down to earth, professional and delicious fare! Thank you Eat Play!
