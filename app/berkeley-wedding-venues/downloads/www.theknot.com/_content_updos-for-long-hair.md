When it comes to your wedding hairstyle, you want something that makes you feel beautiful and confident but is also comfortable. It's not surprising that updos for long hair are such a popular option. Not only do these styles give off an elegant and timeless look, but they are also the most convenient. Wearing your hair off your neck and shoulders keeps you cooler, and that means you don't have to worry as much about your hair getting frizzy or falling flat.

To [choose a wedding hairstyle](https://www.theknot.com/content/choosing-a-wedding-day-hairstyle), Sarai Martinez, celebrity hairstylist at [Sarai By Day](https://www.saraibyday.com/), recommends starting with your dress—the style and cut of your gown will determine whether you should go for a more elegant and refined style or something more casual. She also notes that you should keep hair texture in mind, too, as some styles will work better with certain hair textures. And while classic updos, like French twists or chignons, are always a pretty option, pay attention to trends as well.

## Elegant Updos for Long Hair 

The most elegant and [formal hairstyles](https://www.theknot.com/content/formal-hairstyles) are usually those that are on the simple and classic side. Their easy minimalism makes them a standout style. If you're going for elegance, Martinez loves a slicked-back wedding updo ending with a low, voluminous chignon. "It's a more regal look," she says. 

### 1\. Low Bun With Tendrils 

![Gorgeous low bun for your wedding day hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/d12e95e6-f092-4147-b1d3-490d595c538e~rs_768.h-cr_0.60.720.1020)

A low bun is an easy and sophisticated bridal updo that can work with so many different dresses and wedding themes. Adding a little volume to the crown of your head and pulling out a few front pieces elevates the look and makes it a lot less simple.

### 2\. Embellished Braided Bun

![embellished braided low bun for your wedding day inspo](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/76263605-d6ed-491a-92b8-2e78d3270564~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.2000.2667)

[Braid hairstyles](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-hairstyles-for-long-hair-with-braids) can normally feel a little more casual, but when coiled into a low bun, they look a lot more refined. This low bun is made even more special with the addition of a [bridal hair accessory](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-hair-accessories); in this case, a long string of pearls wraps around the hair and then falls down the back. Feel free to swap the accessory for one that matches your dress. 

### 3\. Textured High Bun 

![A high bun for the best wedding day hair inspiration](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/7ad73dd2-96aa-4b07-8c72-b78c55b24fbd~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.2000.2667)

_[Photography: Felicia V. Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/felicia-v-photography-jacksonville-fl-2011281),__Hair: Samaria Paul_

A beautiful way to show off braids, dreads or the natural texture of your hair is to pull it all into a high bun that sits right on top of your head. When the bun isn't too slick, this really allows your hair type to shine through, and it looks beautiful. As a bonus, it keeps your hair completely off your neck and shoulders. 

### 4\. Low, Loose Chignon

![Low elegant chignon for your wedding day hair inspo](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/7c6e039a-ed2b-4f67-ace9-ec188eb2ee21~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1999.2666)

_[Photography: Ether & Smith](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/ether-and-smith-rancho-cucamonga-ca-559231),__Hair: Chiali Meng_

It's hard to go wrong with a low chignon, which Martinez calls a "classic, romantic look for any bride." Adding volume to the crown of your head and pulling some face-framing pieces out keeps this look elegant without feeling too fussy. 

### 5\. Slicked-Back Bun

![Slicked-back bun for the best long-hair wedding updo](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/fc7584fa-0b0e-4fab-8bf0-23fad10b2fd5~rs_768.h-cr_0.167.2000.2834)

_[Photography: Katherine Elyse Media](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/katherine-elyse-media-lawrenceburg-in-965818)_

A slicked-back bun is low-maintenance and still stylish, not to mention a chic [wedding hair trend](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-hair-trends). It keeps all of your hair away from your face, neck and shoulders, and can put all of the focus on your gown and accessories. It also offers a great opportunity to wear statement jewelry, like large earrings or a necklace. 

### 6\. Sleek Ponytail With Texture

![sleek wedding ponytail with texture](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/4a38421b-8fa6-42ae-b2c8-0744934d0853~rs_768.h-cr_0.148.1778.2519)

_Photography: Mecca Gamble Photography_

When done right, a [ponytail hairstyle](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-ponytail-hairstyles) can look incredibly elegant, even for a black-tie affair. This is a great example of how you can make it work with your [hair type](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-hair-type-tips). Go for a slicked back look by pulling hair into a very tight ponytail, but then let your curls or natural texture free. 

### 7\. Soft Chignon

![Soft Chignon for the best wedding hair updo inspo](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/4c4955ca-81ce-4810-9a7e-caa05f1e211a~rs_768.h-cr_0.249.2986.4230)

_[Photography: Jenelle Kappe Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/jenelle-kappe-photography-tinton-falls-nj-370684),__Hair: High Maintenance Salon_

A classic chignon has a bit of a vintage look, but still manages to feel fresh and stylish. It's polished and beautiful, doesn't try too hard, and allows a lot of attention to go to your gown. Add some volume at the crown, but for a more dressed-up look, keep hair neat and smooth. 

### 8\. Twisted Chignon With Clip

![Twisted Chignon With Clip for the best wedding updo inspo](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/4b9cee2d-954a-4a26-9fdb-7b22044864c5~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1448.1931)

_[Photography: Angela Newton Roy Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/angela-newton-roy-photography-new-york-ny-543702)_

Put a more modern spin on your chignon by twisting your hair back into it. This offers a bit more texture and can also leave your style a bit looser and more relaxed, while still appearing elegant. This is also a great updo hairstyle for weddings if you want to show off a sparkling hair clip. 

### 9\. Sleek, Straight Ponytail

![sleek ponytail for your wedding day inspiration](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/4adbeb83-3db7-4744-b9aa-3a50fa47fd44~rs_768.h-cr_0.221.1659.2433)

_[Photography: Artistrie Co.](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/artistrie-co-chicago-il-396240)_

A voluminous, textured ponytail is nice, but something sleek and straight is just as pretty. "Ponytails have so many variations, it's easy to find inspiration to fit the wedding vibe," Carter says. This sleek style looks beautiful with a classic ball gown and earrings you want to show off. 

### 10\. Retro Curl Updo

![Retro-inspired updo for your wedding day](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/98f5434f-5ee3-4dc8-ace1-fcda915c8dd0~rs_768.h-cr_0.61.2560.3474)

_[Photography: Sherry Hammonds Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/sherry-hammonds-photography-austin-tx-241007)_

If your gown or venue has some vintage flair, you may want to play into that with your hairstyle. This bridal updo for long hair features a low bun with retro pin curls and an S-wave, both of which look so pretty and unique. This is soft and romantic, so it would work well with feminine details. 

### Find your kind of venue

From barns to ballrooms, discover reception venues that feel like you.

### 11\. Slicked Back Low Bun

![slicked back low bun for your wedding day updo inspo](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/be287a6e-8183-4824-a5e7-7f88645698fc~rs_768.h-cr_0.55.2000.2722)

_[Photography: Tamara Gruner Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/tamara-gruner-photography-highlands-ranch-co-848912),__Hair: RC Beauty_

Perfect for brides who don't want to give their hair a second thought during their wedding day, the slicked-back low bun is low-key but gorgeous. This one features tons of shine, a perfect middle part and an overall slick look, with a textured low bun at the nape of the neck. It feels glamorous and modern all at once. 

### 12\. High Bun With Tendrils

![High Bun With Tendrils for your wedding hair inspo](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/3e807650-b2fb-4e11-a765-27e6479d1b06~rs_768.h-cr_0.61.1997.2724)

_[Photography: Petronella Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/petronella-photography-harrison-nj-790420),__[Hair: MeMa Creations](https://memacreations.com/)_

"One of the most trending updos right now is a high-textured bun with some pieces and tresses coming forward," Martinez says. This style is a great example of that, and we love that it allows you to show off your natural hair texture, curls or dreads. To really make an impact, add a showstopping hair accessory, like a crown or tiara. 

### 13\. Pearl Embellished Chignon

![Pearl Embellished Chignon](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/cc477c8e-1845-4421-8e21-f831f4d1e95a~rs_768.h)

_[Photography: Milanes Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/milanes-photography-atlanta-ga-257484),__Hair: Kim Laurent_

A classic chignon is an incredibly popular style, and if you want yours to stand out, you can add some hair accessories. This sleek chignon looks even better with the addition of two small pearl hair clips, which tie right in with embellishments on the gown. You can adjust this to make it work with your gown (like a sparkling hair clip if your dress has crystals). 

### 14\. Soft Bouffant 

![Soft Bouffant for your wedding hair inspiration](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/0eb2b001-0a80-403f-926b-b22c00076656~rs_768.h-cr_0.75.888.1259)

_[Photography: Arising Images](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/arising-images-lake-orion-mi-584817)_

A bouffant style can have a bit of a retro flair, but this can work great with a dress that matches that vibe. This look includes plenty of volume and a side-swept bang that adds some more texture. This is a great updo for a bride with very long hair. 

### 15\. Side-Swept Updo

![Side-Swept Updo for your wedding day](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/34d52e6d-a026-4e63-81d3-64567a6b7acf~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1866.2488)

_[Photography: Elvira Kalviste Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/elvira-kalviste-photography-sleepy-hollow-ny-665903)_

Side-swept updos can be elegant and glamorous, and they feel a bit more low-key than something very slicked back. This option features a side part with a low bun to the side and a floral hair accessory for some added embellishment. 

## Casual Updos for Long Hair

Casual updos are ideal for a more laid-back venue, a gown that doesn't feel super formal or an overall more relaxed vibe. "Something on the casual side would be more bohemian chic, so it might be textured, like curls with a chignon," Martinez says. Carter also likes a low, loose bun or ponytail for a more casual feel, and braids are another great option, especially if you want something more intricate. 

### 16\. Loose High Bun

![loose high bun for your wedding day hair inspo](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/831b629e-3127-407b-a9bb-dba79ea104c4~rs_768.h-cr_0.10.2000.2677)

_[Photography: Sarah Lord Photography](https://sarahlordphoto.com/),__[Hair: Ashley McNabb Artistry](https://ashleymcnabbartistry.com/)_

A loose high bun can feel a bit more relaxed compared to something slicked back, and it's still just as glamorous. This example features plenty of texture and face-framing tendrils, and you can achieve it by curling your hair before piling it into a soft bun. 

### 17\. High Ponytail

![high ponytail hairstyle on your wedding day](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/1fe5d2dd-4430-4643-ad38-7ccf3b2c997e~rs_768.h-cr_0.333.2000.3000)

_Photography: Janey Pakpahan Photography,__[Hair: Nine Zero One Salon](https://ninezeroonesalon.com/)_

A bouncy high ponytail is fun and, when styled the right way, can feel just casual enough. "I often recommend this style because ponytails are perfect for keeping your hair off your face while dancing and will hold up beautifully through the after-party," Carter says. 

### 18\. Embellished Low Ponytail

![embellished low ponytail for your best wedding day hair](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/e997b458-bf68-48cc-a355-c9b19a668d62~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1777.1333)

_[Photography: Logan Cole Photography](https://www.logancoleweddings.com/),__Hair: Kim Katunis_

Carter also loves and recommends a low ponytail that sits at the nape of the neck. Tease your hair or curl it first so that there's some volume and texture. This updo for a wedding is easy and laid-back, and you can make it feel a bit more special by adding an embellished hair accessory. 

### 19\. Braided High Bun 

![elegant braided high bun for your wedding day](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/d929c87a-90e2-494b-bf0c-15f42d5bebeb~rs_768.h-cr_0.11.2000.1511)

_[Photography: Adrian Steinbach Photography](https://adriansteinbach.com/)_

If your wedding look or ceremony is a bit more unconventional (like this bride, who is wearing a black gown instead of a white one), your hair should be too. This unique take on a high bun features a wrap-around braid that is so different and fun. It also ensures that not a hair will be out of place all night. 

### 20\. Low Textured Ponytail

![low textured ponytail for the best wedding day hair](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/ed275611-f9ac-4374-ae9a-817fc368f026~rs_768.h-cr_0.14.720.974)

_[Photography: Shannon Moffit Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/shannon-moffit-photography-chesapeake-va-955748),__Hair: BridesMade_

"Low ponytails feel effortlessly chic and have that perfectly undone, relaxed vibe," Carter says. This long hair wedding updo is simple but so pretty, and the key is adding plenty of texture to your hair. You can accomplish that by curling hair beforehand and then opting for a looser ponytail. Wrap some hair around the band for a more formal look.

### 21\. Braid Crown

![braid crown for your boho wedding day hair](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/8f83073c-6602-44a7-be5e-2d0453908e8a~rs_768.h-cr_0.239.1600.2372)

If you're going for a bohemian look, you can't get much better than a braid crown. This wedding hair updo is cool, modern and romantic, and it's especially ideal for longer hair. You can leave it plain and simpler, keeping it just a bit loose so it's not too slicked back. 

### 22\. Twisted Low Crown

![twisted low crown for romantic wedding day hair](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/761a8328-c4d0-4513-aada-b09bedba3848~rs_768.h-cr_3.0.1520.2023)

_Photography: Nicole Delaine Photography_

Those who love the idea of a braid crown but don't want an actual braid will appreciate this twisted crown into a low bun. It's romantic and feminine, with a soft look that makes it work in a slightly more casual way. A bun at the nape of the neck works perfectly with the twisted crown. 

### 23\. Braided High Bun

![braided high bun for the best romantic wedding day hair](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/43f58acd-08f9-44b6-b72e-a970202949ea~rs_768.h-cr_0.94.1138.1611)

_[Photography: Brianna Wilbur Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/brianna-wilbur-photography-mechanicsburg-pa-766121),__Hair: Bella Christine Salon and Spa_

A braided high bun is another great [hairstyle for long hair](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-hairstyles-long-hair), because it requires a lot of hair to make it look more voluminous. Start with a high ponytail and a braid, then twist it up into a bun. You can secure it with clips or a sparkling band like this for something extra. 

### 24\. Fishtail Braid 

![fishtail braid for the best romantic wedding day hair](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/8e400ea5-f16c-4015-bb9a-f9693296c738~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1962.2616)

_[Photography: J Wiley Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/j-wiley-photography-los-angeles-ca-591343),__Hair: Deyo Studio_

A fishtail braid generally has a very undone, tousled look to it, which makes it a much more casual style. That said, it can still look gorgeous for a wedding and will look especially interesting in photos. Keep it low and a bit messy to really achieve a boho chic look. 

### 25\. Side-Swept Bangs

![side-swept bangs for your wedding day hair](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/85cc1a3b-2d9c-4be6-8d41-0d993858e673~rs_768.h-cr_0.140.2000.2807)

_[Photography: Theel Productions](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/theel-productions-kapolei-hi-2010838),__[Hair: Aloha Bridal Style](https://www.alohabridalstyle.com/)_

Don't feel like you have to hide your bangs or find an updo that keeps them out of your face all night. This look is an example of how side-swept bangs can look really beautiful, especially with a high bun that is a bit on the purposefully messy side. This is glam, trendy and chic all at once without being too fussy. 

### 26\. Twisted Updo With Flowers

![Twisted Updo With Flowers for your best wedding day hair](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/91b3b10a-9666-4490-abec-b3c52f175018~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.2000.2667)

Instead of a low bun, opt for a low twisted updo like this one. You can twist back pieces of hair into a bun-like shape, which is romantic and soft, and perfect for a daytime garden ceremony. Even more perfect? Adding tiny flowers that tie into your bouquet for a beautiful embellishment. 

### 27\. Fishtail Braid and Flower Crown

![Fishtail Braid and Flower Crown for the best boho wedding day hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/d551a5f7-9024-4deb-babd-0107821d3d44~rs_768.h-cr_0.3.720.963)

_[Photography: Photography Anthology](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/photography-anthology-cincinnati-oh-2011633)_

Whether you're opting for boho-chic or a floral theme, a flower crown is always a great idea—a wedding is a perfect opportunity to wear one, especially if yours incorporates nature in some way. You can pair the crown with a mussed-up fishtail braid so that your hair still looks fantastic if you remove it later in the night. 

### 28\. Loose Curly Updo

![loose curly wedding updo](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/e0c7dbbc-774f-4bf8-b051-b97eef03d7d5~rs_768.h-cr_119.0.1079.720)

_[Photography: Julina Marie Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/julina-marie-photography-avon-oh-580280)_

If you have tons of curls, you can show off the natural texture of your hair and keep it off your shoulders with a loose and low curly updo. Just pin pieces of hair back in a very loose bun, add some volume, and make it feel slightly more formal with a sparkling headband or tiara. 

### 29\. Loose Top Knot

![loose top knot for the best wedding style](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/5e5731ad-a872-48e4-a068-e418897e4ef9~rs_768.h-cr_0.162.2677.3731)

A top knot is a beautiful way to show off the back of your gown or some stand-out accessories. This one, which is more loose and definitely not slicked back, is gorgeous and a bit more low-key. It's a classic [bun hairstyle](https://www.theknot.com/content/bun-hairstyles-for-wedding) that you really can't go wrong with, no matter what dress you're wearing. 

### 30\. Low Braid Crown and Bun 

![Low Braid Crown and Bun for the best wedding hairstyles](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/a12d235a-7286-47a0-92b3-f6b8949a8ff9~rs_768.h-cr_162.0.2750.1941)

Romantic and bohemian, this low braid crown has plenty of volume and tousled pieces that make it feel and look so soft. It also incorporates a low bun to make it feel more classic and less trendy. Add tiny flowers or hairpins if you want something extra. 

### 31\. Low Ponytail With Headband

To make a low ponytail a little more exciting, start by twisting your hair back for some texture and volume. Finish the ponytail with an embellished headpiece or headband, and curl the hair in the ponytail for a romantic feel. 

## Wedding Updos With Veil

Even though you only wear your veil for a short portion of the day or night, you still want your [wedding hairstyle](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-hairstyles-you-will-love) to look great underneath. So, keep your veil in mind when choosing an updo. The best [wedding hair with a veil](https://www.theknot.com/content/long-hairstyles-with-veils) is an updo that doesn't get in the way of the material and still looks flawless when the veil is removed—think buns that sit just above or below the veil clip. 

### 32\. Low Bun With Pieces Out 

![low bun with curly romantic pieces out](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/f9598dd0-a73b-44dd-9057-f893e3015129~rs_768.h-cr_0.89.1066.1510)

A low bun is a perfect hairstyle if you're wearing a veil. You can easily clip your veil in directly above the bun so that it hangs nicely down your back or over your face. Keep the front section of your hair out and curled so it frames your face nicely. 

### 33\. Textured Bun

![textured bun for the most romantic wedding day hair](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/c32ef207-4a8e-4985-b0ec-3d3c8e6a4983~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.2000.2667)

Don't hide your natural hair texture on your wedding day. This low bun is a gorgeous example of embracing your curls: They make the bun look so much more interesting. Leave some face-framing curls and clip the veil right above the bun. 

### 34\. Slicked Back Ponytail with Headband 

![Slicked Back Ponytail with Headband for the best modern wedding day style](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/f0307fff-0863-4644-a05a-ff53c1a2cfac~rs_768.h-cr_0.10.2000.2677)

_[Photography: Nikki Daskalakis](https://nikkidaskalakis.com/),__Hair: Glamour by Tori_

A slicked-back ponytail with a veil can look very chic and sophisticated, both when the veil is on and when it's off after the ceremony. You can clip the veil directly above the ponytail so it cascades down nicely. Add an embellished headband for some sparkle. 

### 35\. Veil Underneath the Bun

![Veil Underneath the Bun](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/82ee1cdc-8fad-45a9-a987-f2bee074db6c~rs_768.h-cr_0.112.1066.1533)

_[Photography: MC Weddings](https://www.mc-weddings.com/)_

Many brides choose to clip their veil directly above their updo, so that the veil hangs over the bun or ponytail. But another option is to clip the veil directly below it, like in this image, where the veil sits underneath the bun. This wedding hair updo with a veil works best if the bun sits at the crown of your head. 

### 36\. Braided Bun

![Braided bun for the best wedding day hair](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/250200b3-5717-4012-b080-65c7cca446bd~rs_768.h-cr_0.66.765.640)

Keep a classic bun a little more interesting and modern by first putting your hair in a thick braid. This gives some texture and looks subtly boho chic. If you're going to do that, try clipping your veil beneath the bun so that you can show it off instead of covering it up. 

### 37\. Voluminous Bun

![Voluminous Bun for the best romantic wedding day hair](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/d2ca6187-da00-47d3-860c-7267eb9876de~rs_768.h-cr_0.333.2000.3000)

_[Photography: Iris Mannings Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/iris-mannings-photography-washington-dc-1010532),__[Hair: Hair by MicDiva](https://www.hairbymicdiva.com/)_

Ensure that no guest misses your hairstyle under your veil by making it as dramatic as possible. That means doing a large, voluminous bun, which is perfect for a bride with long hair. You can add a sparkling clip to your part as well to keep things even more glam. 

### 38\. Low Braided Updo

![Low Braided Updo for the best wedding day style for long hair](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/7adab369-4f7e-4976-8543-2238035a3f6b~rs_768.h-cr_223.0.2000.1333)

_[Photography: Kiyah C Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/kiyah-c-photography-atlanta-ga-1090940)_

A soft, braided updo is always a romantic and feminine option, and can work for a variety of dress and veil styles. This loose, braided half crown goes into a low bun. Gently clipping your veil into the center of the hairstyle ensures that everyone can still see it. 

### 39\. Knotted Bun

![romantic knotted bun for your wedding day hair](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/ebe72c04-3bb1-4ebb-b7d5-ac6e69de5786~rs_768.h-cr_0.5.2560.3418)

_[Photography: Roey Yohai Studios](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/roey-yohai-studios-new-york-ny-302474),__Hair: Liam Carey NYC_

Another way to add texture to a classic bun is to opt for a knotted look. Unlike a braided bun, a knotted bun has a traditional and almost nautical feel to it that makes it especially ideal for a wedding that takes place by the water. It also happens to look gorgeous underneath a flowing veil. 

### 40\. Voluminous Low Bun

![low bun hairstyle for the best wedding hair](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/70c61762-085e-466b-ace2-d2377deac967~rs_768.h-cr_0.85.1024.1450)

_[Photography: Studio Brown](https://www.studiobrown.ie/),__[Hair: FMN Studio](https://fmnstudios.com/)_

A low bun is perfect for a long veil, but you may be worried about your hair looking too flat when you're wearing the veil. If that's the case, simply tease the hair at the crown of your head to add plenty of volume. You can clip the veil right above the bun, and it looks gorgeous with or without the veil. 

### 41\. Low Twisted Chignon

![Low Twisted Chignon for the best wedding day hair](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/232c36b8-efc4-4dee-8165-7a44cbb36310~rs_768.h-cr_0.67.800.1134)

_[Photography: Emily Delamater Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/emily-delamater-photography-portland-me-353927)_

This low twisted chignon is a beautiful hairstyle that you'll want to show off all night long. And you can definitely do that, even when wearing your veil—note how this bride has her veil clipped in beneath the updo at the nape of her neck. This keeps it more subtle and leaves the veil trailing behind nicely. 

### 42\. Loose Curly Updo

![loose curly updo for the best wedding day styles for long hair](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/723132d6-1dd4-4048-9846-aa43fb0263e7~rs_768.h-cr_0.16.922.1245)

_Photography: Robin Proctor Photography_

One option for a traditional bridal updo is curling all of your hair, then carefully pinning it back into a sort of mussed-up bun-like look. This simple updo for long hair is romantic, pretty and intricate, and looks especially great with a sparkling hair clip. Add your veil over the top so it doesn't get tangled. 

### 43\. Side-Swept Low Bun

![Side-Swept Low Bun for the best wedding day hair](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/cfbc4e54-19f8-4f96-b1d8-966f5918c680~rs_768.h-cr_0.213.2560.3626)

_[Photography: Mintwood Photo Co.](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/mintwood-photo-co-athens-ga-874194)_

A middle part might be more modern and trendy, but a side part can feel very glamorous, especially on your wedding night. This side-swept low bun is loose, romantic, and features a side part, as well as a voluminous bun at the nape of your neck. 

### 44\. Sleek Side Part with Bun

![Sleek Side Part with Bun](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/5daed6a7-df80-4559-866a-4af9b1586fff~rs_768.h-cr_0.11.1854.2483)

_Photography: JDHowell Photography,__Hair: K Bella Salon_

If loose and romantic isn't your thing, keep things more slicked back and polished with this elegant wedding hair updo with a veil. It still incorporates a side part, but the hair is much sleeker and in place, with clean lines and a structured look. This looks really pretty with a long, voluminous veil. 

### 45\. Side Bun with a Short Veil

![Side Bun with a Short Veil for the best long-hair wedding day styles](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/e6726b60-757b-47e8-8043-e5f0203499cd~rs_768.h-cr_0.5.1333.1782)

_[Photography: James Rubio Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/james-rubio-photography-hilo-hi-345229),__Hair: Terrye Veal_

A birdcage veil is a vintage-inspired look that is so glamorous and pretty. It looks great with a side bun with curly texture and plenty of volume. This wedding updo for long hair looks beautiful with or without the veil.
