We cannot put into words how magical our wedding day at V. Sattui Winery was—it truly exceeded every expectation. From the moment we stepped onto the property, we knew this was the...

place. The combination of the romantic stone architecture, the lush vineyards, and the warm, golden Napa light created the most breathtaking backdrop we could have imagined. The V. Sattui events team was nothing short of incredible. They were organized, attentive, and genuinely invested in making our day seamless and unforgettable. Every detail was handled with care, from the timeline coordination to the impeccable wine pairings. Our guests are still raving about the food and, of course, the wine. The culinary team delivered a meal that was elegant yet comforting—exactly what we wanted. And having award-winning wines served throughout the evening made the experience feel authentically Napa. The courtyard ceremony, the vineyard photos at sunset, and the candlelit barrel room reception gave the entire day a sense of romance and intimacy that we’ll treasure forever. It felt like we were transported to Tuscany, but with the convenience and charm of Napa Valley. If you’re considering V. Sattui for your wedding—do it. It’s not just a venue; it’s an experience that will stay with you and your guests for a lifetime. We feel so lucky to have started our forever in a place this beautiful.

Much like our relationship, it was love at first site with V. Sattui. It was the first venue we visited, and when we left, we decided it was the one. We were greeted by Alison, V. ...

Sattui's incredible events coordinator, and after our around hour long visit, we were hooked. Let me explain... V. Sattui is one of the only (if not the only) vineyard in Napa that allows guests until 11 pm. Your guests arrive in the early evening, so you have the ENTIRE winery to yourself (including back terrace, courtyard, lawn, barrel room, cellar club etc). It is absolutely beautiful, and gives your guests a chance to explore a great winery that I am sure they will visit after the wedding. The venue has gorgeous florals and greenery all over, so the need for florals is minimal (at least it was for our end of March wedding, and will be through fall I would imagine). The barrel room where dinner is held is magical - lit up with candles, it is straight out of a fairy tale. There is a huge selection of wine for any palette, and the wine is absolutely delicious (and we had a very fun 2.5 hour long tasting before the wedding). Also, we were in the off-season, but in the on-season, I have heard their on-site Michelin-starred chef is amazing. Now, about the service. Alison is amazing. She knows so much about weddings (not just weddings at Sattui), and is responsive, friendly and warm. She is honest in her opinions, never trying to sell you anything or convince you one way or another. We really enjoyed getting to know her over the last year and a half, and we look forward to seeing her when we visit Sattui (wedding perk - a 1 year membership after your wedding!!). The day of staff at Sattui were also impeccable. They were attentive, friendly, and my guests loved them. One guest told me she couldn't find the coordinator to put down a card, so she asked a server. He couldn't find the coordinator either, but 30 minutes later, when he finally tracked her down, he went to find my guest and introduced her to the coordinator. That level of attention and detail meant that our wedding was flawless, and went off without a hitch. I cannot recommend Sattui as a venue enough. It made our wedding such a special day, and is a great place to revisit again and again.

We recently had our wedding at V. Sattui, and I have to say our feelings are so mixed about our chosen location. Of course, the winery is absolutely beautiful, it is the setting of...

a dream wedding, complete with castle, flowers, lights- everything to make you feel like you are getting married in a fairytale. They are also one of the only wineries in Napa that are able to host wedding ceremonies and receptions in one location. Unfortunately, this means they have a bit of a monopoly on the situation, and I have to say it shows in the way they conduct the whole affair. From the beginning, we had so many different contact people at the venue for each thing that we had no idea who to contact about what. What made it worse was that they kept changing! We did not hire a wedding planner (but were going to hire a day of planner) when they offered to provide this service for us for free, which sounded fantastic and really kind, until we worked with one person only to find out two weeks later that they were changing us to a different planner and had to start the process from scratch (they did not even pass the information that was already discussed). The new one I have to say was disorganized, frustrating to work with, and downright rude to members of the wedding party and my mother on the day of the wedding! I could not recommend working with someone like this as it made the situation more stressful rather than easier. Our second frustration was that during wedding season V. Sattui requires you to use their in-house caterers. At first, we had no real issue with this, our menu tasting was great, and both the manager and the chef are lovely people. Unfortunately, the day of the wedding the food was not what we thought it would be- the appetizers looked burnt, the quantity of appetizers was not nearly enough (even though we ordered more than their recommended amount), and the entrees, while good, were TINY (the salmon entrée was literally a 2 inch piece of salmon with nothing else on the plate). All in all, we spent almost $150 for catering per person, and our guests left HUNGRY! This was incredibly disappointing, and added to our whole frustration with the venue who did not seem to care much about us or our wedding. For the price we paid we would have expected them to go above and beyond, but they did the bare minimum. The bridal party was not greeted, winery visitors were sitting in our ceremony chairs and interfering with pre-wedding photos (this area could have been roped off), the bridal party was not given champagne or even water until we asked several times, bathrooms were not cleaned before the wedding.. All in all, yes it is beautiful, in spite of everything we had a wonderful wedding, but those thinking to get married here should know the tradeoff.

We had our wedding at V. Sattui and it was gorgeous. Everyone talked about how beautiful it was. The venue is spectacular. That said, it was quite pricey, given that the venue ...

itself is pricey and then there are lots of add-ons (costs of cleaning aisle if you use roses, lighting votive candles that appear to be permanently there, ordering wine ahead of time rather than just paying for what you use). They lay most of these costs out in the contract, but read it carefully... bc I did and still missed a couple things. The timing is also tight and made me really nervous in the run up to the wedding, since I went to the venue after 5 (which is when the bride arrives) and found out that despite what we were initially told, the tasting room closes at 6pm (when our guests arrived). It's a narrow window that you get the venue (6-11). The only thing guests complained about were the locations of bathrooms (all upstairs from the barrel room). I would strongly recommend V. Sattui consider expanding the list of "preferred" planners and vendors. While we liked many of our vendors, some which came recommended by the venue, we found difficult to work with. Overall it was beautiful and I read the contracts closely so I was aware of the extras.. but I still felt like they were taking me for a bit of a ride on price.

They are the best EVER!! I got so many compliments from my guests saying that it was the most beautiful and intimate wedding that they've ever been to and it wouldn't have been the same in any other place. Also, I received my deposit within a week of the wedding being over so they were incredibly quick!

Very beautiful. Kinda pricey. They nickel and dime alot of services. Most of the little things should be added in the total rental fee. Ex: Rose Petal Aisle clean up fee $150, e...

ach heat lamp $50, etc....Most of this is pretty standard and should be included in the $7500 rental fee. The venue doesn't even provide tables or chairs, you'll need to rent them from your caterer. And you are also required to use a Wedding Coordinator from their Preferred List, they don't provide you with one. I have planned about 6 weddings for friends, family, colleagues, and most of this stuff should have been included. The site fee of $7500 (weekday) $9500 (weekend) only included literally the use of the facility. And because the winery is open to the public until 5pm, they bridal party cannot be there to take pictures until 4:30, which doesn't give alot of time when ceremonies usually start around 6. Plus, you have alot of winery guests watching you and taking pictures of you, which is kinda distracting. Overall, it's a beautiful location and worth the great photo opportunities, so make sure to get an amazing photographer to capture all of it.

t pay attention to the details. It is $10,000 just have the wedding there which you only have for 5 hours. They do not allow you to start your ceremony before 6pm and you the music has to stop by 11pm. By the time we got to dancing, we had less than 2 hours. We had 150 guests and it was a tight squeeze in the barrel room. I would suggest this place for small, low key weddings.

ps, you and your guests will then be whisked away to the barrel room for your banquet where the sky and your imagination are the limits. This winery fits a larger capacity than most (over 200) and whethery you are having 50 or 200, it somehow is a perfect size. The V.Sattui service and family are amazing hosts and by the wedding rolls around, you feel half Italian and definitely more than 1/2 a part of their friendly family. The rental rate is steep but their flexibility in catering and wine commitment helps make up for it.

Our wine tasting for the wedding was a fabulous experience in a private room where we tried over 15 wines! It was great. And the wines we selected for the event were delicious.
