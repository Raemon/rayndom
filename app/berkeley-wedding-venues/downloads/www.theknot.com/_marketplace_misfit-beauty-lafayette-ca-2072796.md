Angelique La fountain - Rivera

Owner & Lead Artist

My passionate expression with makeup and hair traces back to early childhood. And with 15 years of experience in the beauty industry and business, and as Bobbi Brown-trained Artist. Misfit Beauty was created to focus on not essentially fitting in with the crowd but more on defining your one-in-a-million beauty. I take a personal approach to Makeup & Hair Artistry and created a customized cosmetic process that will enhance your natural beauty with a personal beauty quiz. You are not just booking hair and makeup, but a positive, relaxing, and stress-free experience start to your special day!

It's hard to express how good I feel about this experience. I was hesitant to book hair and makeup services because I was honestly scared of judgement. My mom and friends all encou...

raged me to hire a professional and I am so happy I did. Angelique listened to my pretty vague ideas and delivered results that made me feel so much more confident and happy. Definitely recommend the pre-wedding trial session. It really locked in the plan, gave me one less thing to worry about during the run up to the big day, and gave us an excuse for a "just because" night out before things got crazy. Angelique is super talented, professional, kind, and helped make the day so special.

Angelique did my hair for Brittney’s wedding, and I couldn’t have been happier with the experience. From start to finish, she was professional, kind, and incredibly talented. She r...

eally listened to what I wanted and executed it beautifully—my hair held up perfectly throughout the entire day and photographed so well. She brought such a calm, positive energy on a busy wedding morning, which made the whole process even better. I felt confident, comfortable, and genuinely loved how my hair turned out. I would absolutely recommend Angelique to anyone looking for a skilled and reliable bridal hair artist. It was a pleasure working with her!

Angelique is kind and very understanding about my needs as a client. As someone who does not know make-up very much, she was accommodating about everything. During the trial run, s...

he was making sure to take her time to match the foundation with my skin tone. During the wedding day, I never felt more beautiful and everybody complimented me how I was glowing. She also did my mother’s and mother-in-law’s make-up and they were both stunning. Her price point is not as crazy as the others, y’all know what I mean. I highly recommend Misfit Beauty!

Angelique was simply the best. After a bad trial with a different makeup artist I was down to the wire and needed to find an alternative. I wrote Angelique with all my concerns fro...

m the first trial and she wrote back a detailed email back assuring me how we’d approach it on my wedding day to make sure it would be perfect. She arrived on time and we had so much fun getting ready. She made me feel beautiful and like myself - not caked in makeup and unnatural. All my bridesmaids loved her work as well. She was a chill, fun presence in a highly stressful time. She sent tips before hand to make sure we were ready to roll come wedding day and was super thorough in saving all our inspo photos so she had them handy. I got so many compliments on my hair and makeup. I highly recommend Angelique!!
