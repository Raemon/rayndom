## FAQ: How to Buy Gifts for Your Pregnant Wife

Even if you're a pro at picking gifts, finding a present for your pregnant wife can be challenging. We've asked an expert for some practical advice to help you navigate your shopping.

### What should you get for your pregnant wife?

When it comes to choosing pregnant wife gifts, there are a few important things to consider. [Martina Garvey](https://www.thebump.com/author/martina-garvey), Senior E-Commerce Editor at The Bump, has some pointers to share. "My advice is to avoid traditional gifts like perfume as she may be more sensitive to fragrance, especially in the first trimester when nausea can be triggered by strong scents. Instead, you could opt for natural bath products or fragrance-free skincare. Just make sure the brand specifies that it is pregnancy-safe." 

If you're thinking of planning a relaxing getaway before the baby arrives, timing is crucial. "The second trimester is typically the best time to go on a babymoon," Garvey says, "as symptoms like morning sickness will have eased off and she'll have more energy for sight-seeing." 

### What is a good gift for your pregnant wife?

Now that you're armed with expert advice, you'll have a better idea of what makes a good gift for your pregnant wife. If you're still stuck, here's one last tip."My top gift recommendation for an expectant mom is a gift card for a pregnancy massage. It's a little luxury she can look forward to and it'll earn you brownie points," Garvey says. Other picks she suggests are a comfy maternity robe, cooling bed sheets, fresh flowers and a snack box filled with your wife's favorite treats.
