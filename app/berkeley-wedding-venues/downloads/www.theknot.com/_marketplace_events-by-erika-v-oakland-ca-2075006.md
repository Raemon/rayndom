Hello! I offer Day-of Coordination so your event can be fun, memorable, and stress-free! As a Day-of Coordinator, my goal is to make your special day as stress-free and smooth as possible so you can enjoy your friends and family. As a South Asian woman, I am familiar with the nuance and traditions that South Asian weddings of all faiths often require. I pride myself on being able to facilitate inter-faith weddings and co-creating inter-faith ceremonies with couples so that both partners feel well represented and seen on the day-of (especially when one partner is South Asian). I am also very comfortable facilitating Jewish ceremonies, areligious weddings, and non-traditional events — unique ceremonies are often the most fun to help with! Most importantly, as a third party and a vendor, I can navigate family politics with empathy and skillfulness. You can trust me: I get it and I’ve got you. Though I am located in Oakland, CA, I am happy to travel across the state to help make your dreams a reality. At Events by Erika V, I aim to make your life easier and your wedding more joyful. Give the grunt work to me so you can dance the night away! PRICING ESTIMATES 8 hours: $1600-$2000 10 hours: $1800-$2200 12+ hours (full day): from $2200 Please note, all pre-work required before the wedding is included in this fee! I will work with you during the weeks prior to create a Run of Show, which will detail our plans for the course of the day. We will also create a vendor contact list so that I’m able to oversee vendor setup and/or teardown, as needed. Once contracted, I am available to answer questions or concerns you may have during the planning process to the best of my ability and within reason, and am happy to provide insight or input when possible.

We highly recommend Erika as a day-of coordinator!

It was great to be able to let go of the reins once the wedding started and know that she was organized, attuned to what we wanted, and adaptable. If we had to do it over again (which hopefully we won't!!), we'd pick Erika every time <3

s demonstrated an unparalleled level of dedication, professionalism, and passion for her work. Erika's communication skills are top-notch. She kept us informed every step of the way, ensuring that we were always in the loop and that our opinions were valued. She was always available to answer our questions and address any concerns we had, often anticipating our needs before we even voiced them.

our day we came way feeling less-stressed, more-prepared, and more ready-to-celebrate than we did before. She even helped us find other vendors and workers for the day. Really couldn't ask for more. On the actual day she allowed us to just enjoy the moment so we didn't have to worry at all about any of the details. 10/10!

Bringing Erika on as our wedding coordinator was the best decision I made. Her personable nature made communication effortless, and her relentless can-do spirit alleviated my nerve...

s. As a DIY bride, my wedding had a lot of moving parts and details. We were planning our CA wedding from the east coast which made it really difficult to get a grasp on how everything would come together. Additionally, we had some vendors who were difficult to communicate with. Erika handled the final details with these vendors and seamlessly tied all the pieces together so that it all flowed flawlessly, allowing me to relax and truly be present on the big day. What sets Erika apart is her ability to tackle problems and solve them creatively and thoughtfully on the fly. Given that we only had our venue for ten hours AND we finalized a lot of details at the last minute, the pressure was on to set everything up, transition for the reception, and then remove everything by the end of the night. This tight timeline, coupled with unexpected issues from our rental vendor, created quite a challenge. Erika understood what would have the biggest impact and found creative solutions that kept everything running smoothly. Her keen eye and creativity transformed the venue into an awe-inspiring setting that far exceeded my expectations. I was so blown away when I came down the aisle at how everything came together, it was beautiful. For anyone in need of a wedding coordinator, Erika will handle all the details so that you get to experience a smooth and joyful wedding day. For us, she swooped in and tackled a truly complex set of vendors, venue spaces and timelines to bring together an incredible wedding that we’ll remember for the rest of our lives. I can’t imagine having done this without her. THANK YOU ERIKA!! <3

I don't think my wife and I can rave enough about how phenomenal of a day-of wedding coordinator Erika was. What I immediately noticed about Erika was her efficiency and "get stuff...

done" mentality that I was really looking for in a coordinator. Initial impressions did not disappoint as she met frequently with us to iron out any issues that came up. She not only addressed our existing concerns but predicted possible future issues and offered her solution options that we often opted to do. Our wedding day was a relatively difficult wedding to coordinate, yet she consistently handled all the challenges that arose with grace and a level head. She informed us when certain alcohol was running out and helped coordinate the delivery of more before it ran out at the bar. When the venue was lagging on setup at the appropriate time, she was assertive with the restaurant and able to "be the bad guy" to get things done so that we didn't have to be. We are shocked she only has 4 reviews at the time of writing this, but I have no doubt she will earn many more in the future through her fantastic work. Thank you for everything! Love, Mike and Jasmine

her. Erika is organized, detail oriented, an excellent communicator, thorough, exceptionally hard-working, and has an incredible eye for design. We worked with Erika to plan and execute our Hindu wedding in Palm Springs while planning from the Bay Area. Erika goes above and beyond as a planner, she did everything from designing and fabricating our outfits with a seamstress in India to hosting multiple meetings with our families to ensure everyone was on the same page. Erika has an amazing eye for design, she designed our centerpieces and programs, and did so much to make our Hindu ceremony beautiful. If you are having a cross-cultural wedding, I can't recommend Erika enough.
