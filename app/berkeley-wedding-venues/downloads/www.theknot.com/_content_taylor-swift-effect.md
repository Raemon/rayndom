Updated Sep 15, 2025

The Taylor Swift Effect as a phenomenon isn't new, nor is it unique to the wedding industry. Swift's influence reaches far and wide around the world, including the 1 out of every 2 Americans who consider themselves a fan of her music. Every action and decision made by the artist has ripple effects globally, leading to cultural shifts in spending and trends. (In fact, the "Taylor Swift Effect" was introduced by mainstream media outlets in 2022, during the singer's record-setting _Eras_ Tour. Soon after, "[Swiftonomics](https://theknot.com/content/swiftonomics)"–a term coined by _Bloomberg_ journalist Augusta Saraiva, and inspired by the concept of "rockonomics" by late economist Alan Krueger–traced the very real economic shifts and financial growth generated by the multi-hyphenate.)

In August 2025, Swift's engagement to NFL player Travis Kelce capped off a relationship history that fans followed through decades of her music and press coverage. Rousing Swifties across the US, **37% of couples said the couple's engagement announcement made them even more excited about their own soonlywed status**. The Knot team predicts that the wedding industry is next to feel the Taylor Swift Effect–and we're naming it the "Swiftification of Weddings."

**In This Report:**

  * I. The Swiftification of Weddings: The Taylor Swift Effect on the Industry
  * II. What This Means for Wedding Pros
  * III. The Swiftification of Weddings: By the Numbers
  * IV. Our Methodology



## I. The Swiftification of Weddings: The Taylor Swift Effect on the Industry




The wedding choices that Taylor and Travis make could result in what we estimate to be a significant impact on the industry. We speculate that the Taylor Swift Effect could result in **$2.2 billion in net new spend from couples across the globe** over the next two years. How did we get there? The Knot built financial models to predict what this might look like for consumers, wedding pros, and the industry, based on potential wedding planning steps that Swift and Kelce may take. 

FEATURED VIDEO FROM THE KNOT

While it's still early days, we've seen increases in both search and demand for vintage and custom engagement rings, as well as positive stock market shifts for jewelers like Signet Jewelers. We noted immediate sell-outs of products and brands, as well as an increased interest in gardens (**+70% increase in search demand on The Knot Vendor Marketplace**) and the floral industry. Among other things, our team estimated an increase in spend on weddings, relative to Swift's general effect on the economy, resulting in a $1.8B incremental spend on US weddings over the next two years. We also forecast the Swiftification of Weddings will result in a $400M lift on global weddings where this effect may hold its influence across a period of two years. 

**Our Assumptions**

  * **The Swift Effect and Swiftonomics are proven theories,** especially in recent years with the financial impact driven by the _Eras_ tour in the US and abroad.

  * **The Royal Weddings** of both Harry and Meghan (2018), as well as Kate and William (2011) gave us wedding-specific proof points that a single, high-profile event can drive both significant economic impact and lasting trends for future events.

  * **Swift and Kelce's engagement announcement** lit the news cycle on fire the last two weeks. From interest in certain floral arrangements and scenery to her fashion choices, the immediate impact has been both massive and positive across the industry in driving social engagement and commerce. It remains the most-liked proposal post in Instagram history with over 36 million likes.

  * **If Taylor and Travis satisfy our "wildest dreams" with a swoon-worthy US wedding** , then there's likely much more wedding industry impact on the way. For the purposes of this report, we assumed that Taylor and Travis will throw about 4 to 5 wedding (and related) events, which is typical to most US couples.




### **What We Predict**

  * **Their engagement and upcoming union will generate wedding enthusiasm:** The rite of passage of weddings from a high-profile celebrity can create more interest in the cultural conversation, as reflected by the amount of coverage. 
    * We forecast even more dialogue around weddings that Swift's Millennial and Gen Z fans will be eager to discuss as she plans.

  * We predict an **increase in spend on weddings, fueled by couples' decision-making.**
    * Swift and Kelce's attire choices will **significantly influence fashion purchases made by other couples** as they plan their own weddings. (Think Kate Middleton's effect on lace and long-sleeve gowns with her Alexander McQueen wedding dress.) 

    * Swift and Kelce's decor choices will affect couples' aesthetic decisions.

    * Swift is well-known for artfully hiding Easter eggs (clues) throughout her music to connect with her fans. We imagine she will pour great thought into her wedding, encouraging couples to do the same with Easter eggs of their own for their nuptials. 

    * An increased demand for **professional florals, photo and video, stationery, and day-of styling.**

  * **They will drive local economies and tourism, based on other wedding event locations.**
    * **Significant interest in potential wedding location:** It's been rumored that Taylor and Travis will host their wedding at her "Holiday House" in Rhode Island, allowing for privacy in a locale that is sentimental to the couple. Whatever destination the couple selects could result in a boost for local tourism.




### The Celebrations Era: Other Wedding Event Impact

![the knot taylor swift wedding report](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/0f873d03-7f33-419c-b8e5-f4ac1d0867eb~rs_768.h)

_The Knot_

Weddings involve family, friends, and plenty of celebratory moments along the way. Swift, who's well-known for guarding her inner circle, is favored to honor various milestones throughout her engagement with her squad of A-lister and lifelong friends. We predict she will celebrate meaningful wedding-adjacent events, including a bachelorette party, bridal shower, and rehearsal dinner, which could inspire couples to also prioritize celebrating these same milestones. Additionally, we estimate the locations of Swift's various pre- and post- wedding events could generate significant amounts of revenue across local economies as more couples may be inspired to not only throw more parties, but to take Taylor's choices into account too. 

  * **$400M estimated bump in US wedding-adjacent event spend** over the next two years, dependent on what Taylor and Travis decide to do and reveal publicly, including:
    * Estimated $220M net new spend on bridal showers, bachelor/ette parties, and rehearsal dinners.

    * Estimated $180M net new spend on honeymoons.




### The _Pro_ -Posal Era: The Engagement Impact

![the knot proposal surge](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/0bb13037-eb5e-445a-b71a-14d3d577b171~rs_768.h)

It's also safe to bet that proposals are getting a thoughtful makeover. While this milestone has long been a gesture of great detail and timing, Kelce took it to _Great Heights_ with a personalized and private proposal (that could only have been executed with the help of event professionals). The chosen setting for the moment was reportedly the backyard of Kelce's Leawood, Kansas estate. The athlete chose to bring in a floral designer to transform his gazebo into a whimsical garden, as a likely nod to the landscape featured in Swift's _Lover_ music video. For two weeks, the couple relished in this milestone moment before dropping the big news on Instagram with a collab post between Swift and Kelce. Given the sheer impressions on the social media "drop" alone, we anticipate couples could recreate aspects of this moment for years to come, spiking increased demand for pros, like photographers and florists.

  * **25% of couples** already hire pros for engagements and we anticipate this number to increase meaningfully to drive **an estimated $120M bump in spend on pros like proposal/engagement photographers and florists** over the next two years.

  * We saw**a 71% increase in searches for engagement photographers** on The Knot Vendor Marketplace the week of Taylor Swift's engagement announcement (compared to the prior week).




### The Bedazzled Era: Diamond Industry Impact

![taylor swift rings reimagined the knot wedding report swiftification numbers reveal 350 million bump in wedding jewelry](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/060d699b-544e-4a15-8737-014bda8b7a9b~rs_768.h)

_Photo: Getty Images_

Swift has long been described as an old soul, which is why her old mine brilliant cut diamond (which has 58 internal facets as _5 + 8 = 13_) was no surprise. In fact, The Knot team sees it as a refreshing choice, likely turning the tide for jewelry trends to come. Swift's ring was designed by local NYC jeweler Kindred Lubeck of Artifex Fine Jewelry, whose entire inventory is now sold out. Sources affirm that they have seen [an increased interest in old mine cuts](https://www.theknot.com/content/old-mine-cut-engagement-rings) and vintage jewelry since Swift's engagement. We predict jewelers offering old mine diamonds, as well as other vintage cuts will see an increase in interest. _What's a girl gonna do? A diamond's gotta shine._

  * **$350M estimated bump in spend on wedding jewelry in the US alone** over the next two years, with more couples potentially buying engagement rings in the next two years and a slight increase in the average price purchased to align more closely with the style of Taylor's ring. We also assume a similar effect will take place for wedding bands once Taylor and Travis release those details to the world.

  * **85%** of couples are currently opting for diamond engagement rings, according to The Knot 2025 Real Weddings Study, which could increase even further with the Taylor Swift Effect.




### The Wedding Wardrobe Era: Fashion Impact

![200 million estimated increase in US wedding attire purchases the knot swiftification of weddings report taylor swift](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/38c082b7-dc31-4617-aa76-7f4968ace40c~rs_768.h)

_Photo: Getty Images_

Fact: Swift's striped dress from Polo Ralph Lauren that she was wearing during her engagement sold out the same day the announcement went up on Instagram. What's more is that certain rental marketplaces, like Pickle, have seen an increased interest in Ralph Lauren pieces from shoppers. We forecast that the same will hold true for bridal designers and retailers who contribute to Swift's entire [bridal capsule wardrobe](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-wardrobe) (a concept giving brides permission to curate dozens of looks that was first introduced on TikTok in 2021). This could range from her bachelorette party outfits to every look she selects for her wedding day. Additionally, fashion pros could also benefit from offering similar styles. We've seen it with Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton–who's not to say we'll see the same from Swift. It's safe to say Taylor's bridal capsule era has arrived.

  * **6 in 10 wedding professionals anticipate that fashion could see the biggest impact** for those who are planning current or future weddings.

  * **$200M estimated bump on US wedding attire purchases** over the next two years like wedding dresses, wedding party attire, groom/groomsmen attire, as well as bridal stylists to help mimic outfits. Based on the assumption that Taylor and her wedding party will buy and publicly reveal their dresses, we believe more couples will purchase dresses, and at slightly higher prices to closely mirror Taylor's likely higher cost choices. 




### The 'Enchanted Garden' Era: Design Impact

![the knot enchanted garden era taylor swift proposal wedding 70% spike on the knot in searches for "garden"](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/ec4ac9bd-83a8-4436-9e26-f6eec30c9f46~rs_768.h)

_Photo: So Tender is Humanity; Florals: The Floral Way_

Hear us now: gardens may be the "it" theme for 2026. While Swifties around the world were celebrating the engagement, The Knot team was busy [zooming in on every detail](https://www.theknot.com/content/taylor-swift-proposal) of the proposal photos. That included the garden roses, ranunculus, anemone, hydrangea and other florals, a display so beautiful and wow-worthy that couples and wedding pros could see more of these dreamy floral aesthetics infiltrating events in 2026 and beyond. 

  * **$160M estimated bump on US wedding floral purchases** over the next two years, as couples try to match and align with [the garden aesthetic](https://www.theknot.com/content/enchanted-garden) from Taylor's engagement and eventual wedding. 

  * **More than 70% of wedding pros and one-third of couples** **agree that Taylor and Travis' vibe could influence wedding aesthetics** in the upcoming year. 

  * In fact,**over 60% of couples said her garden engagement most caught their eye** from the couple's proposal.

  * We saw **a 70% increase in searches for "garden" on The Knot Vendor Marketplace** the week of Taylor Swift's engagement announcement (compared to the prior week).




### The Guest List Impact: Guest Travel Impact

![440 million estimated bump in us guest travel related spend](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/5fe034d9-ac4b-456c-a921-0d77016d3400~rs_768.h)

_The Knot_

If we know one thing about Taylor Swift: _She had a marvelous time_ –and that includes hosting guests for her star-studded parties. As she and Kelce enjoy celebrating their circle of friends and family members, we imagine that the wedding and pre-wedding festivities–wherever they're held–will also be quite the spectacle. We forecast that the world will be watching where guests land their accommodations (we estimate full buyouts of venues and properties). Additionally, with any semblance of a wedding, transportation, including flights, will also be required, driving up total guest spend too.

  * **$440M** **estimated bump in US guest travel-related spend** over the next two years as the number of weddings potentially grows (e.g. flights, hotels, car rentals, car-shares, etc.)

  * **$160M estimated bump in wedding gifting** from guests

  * **$300M estimated bump for local non-wedding tourism:** Retail, restaurants, etc.




## II. What This Means for Wedding Pros

### Certain Vendors Will Feel the Taylor Swift Effect

As her engagement and wedding unfold publicly, roughly**50% of wedding pros believe it could impact their business**. Our initial models help explain why: more focus on demand for the trends that she sets could lead to an incremental but meaningful growth in wedding budgets overall, and outsized gains for categories that map most directly to what couples can see and recreate.

### A Rising Tide for the Industry

Taylor consistently sparks discovery and purchase behavior among consumers. In weddings, that shows up as spikes in demand for visual and aesthetic categories—florals, fashion, photo and video, stationery, and day-of styling. 

During the week the engagement was announced, searches on The Knot Vendor Marketplace increased **71% for "engagement photographers"** and **70% for "garden."** Expect more demand for these wedding pros as well as planners who can scout and stage, floral designers who can build sculptural installations, and venues with tucked-away courtyards. 

### Multi-Event Momentum

Weddings are already multi-event celebrations, and Swift's public image aligns, delivering in chapters—[eras, looks and gatherings](https://www.theknot.com/content/taylor-swift-themed-wedding) each with distinct vibes. Couples will mirror that cadence with private engagements followed by engagement revelations and celebrations, showers, bach trips, welcome parties, rehearsal dinners, day-after brunches, even mini-moons. Her likely "bridal capsule" wardrobe—multiple looks across multiple moments—pulls even more wedding pros into the fold.

This creates more touchpoints per couple and more opportunities for wedding pros. Beauty teams and stylists can book fittings and on-site touchups across events; photographers and videographers will earn praise for a cohesive visual line from proposal through day-after brunch; and venues, caterers, rentals, and entertainers can merchandise small-format experiences that feel produced but personal.

### Who Gains the Most? The Share of Wallet

![top vendor categories taylor swift wedding report the knot](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/afd5820a-f190-42c4-b850-617927c82e09~rs_768.h)

_The Knot_

  1. Jewelry is first in line as couples have already begun researching vintage-inspired cuts and heirloom settings that echo Swift's engagement ring. Jewelers who educate on old-mine aesthetics and offer band or stack upgrade paths can capture that curiosity to convert it into higher average order value.

  2. As we've seen with Taylor's sell-out engagement dress, fashion is a fast follow. Bridal fashion, salons, and menswear benefit as the "capsule era" mindset takes greater hold: second looks, rehearsal ensembles, accessories mapped to each event. 

  3. Floral and décor teams can ride the garden-romance wave—roses, ranunculus, anemone, hydrangea—styled into immersive installations with smart, multi-day repurposing plans. 

  4. Photographers and videographers may see gains as briefs shift toward editorial-meets-documentary coverage of fashion moments, produced environments, and guest experience. 

  5. Stationery and signage tie it all together with materials, suites and settings that create a throughline across events, add Easter eggs that enhance the couple's story, and further echo their aesthetic.

  6. Wherever the wedding is held, local venues—and the businesses around them—could see outsized gains as couples book multi-event weekends and echo Taylor's selections.




### How Pros Ride the Wave

Even outside of those key categories, wedding pros who monitor trends and connect the dots—looks, multi-event services, and high production values—will reap the benefits. Make your capabilities unmistakable: show recent garden-forward work, demonstrate multi-event storytelling, and name packages that map to the couple's passions.

## III. The Swiftification of Weddings: By the Numbers




![swiftonomic effect on weddings](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/5e37ef4d-1d09-4348-86da-fc7f3918050e~rs_768.h)

_Photo: Getty Images_

  * **An Increase in Spend:**
    * **$2.2B:** The estimated increase in global wedding spend in the next two years as a result of Taylor and Travis getting married.
      * We estimate that in the US, people will spend over $350M more on jewelry, $200M more in wedding fashion, and $400M more on other wedding events like bachelor/ette parties, bridal showers and honeymoons. 

  * **A Shift in Aesthetics:** More than 70% of wedding pros and one-third of couples agree that Taylor and Travis' vibe could influence wedding aesthetics in the upcoming year. 

  * **New Fashion and Jewelry Trends:** Already, her old mine brilliant cut ring is driving interest. Whatever Swift wears, we imagine consumers will follow. 

  * **An Embrace of Gardens:**
    * Over 60% of couples said her garden engagement most caught their eye from the couple's proposal.

    * Searches for "Garden" are **up 70%** on The Knot Vendor Marketplace since Taylor and Travis announced their engagement news (compared to the prior week).

  * **The Rise of the Proposal Photographer**
    * While 1 of 5 couples already hire engagement photographers, we can see the imminent rise of this vendor. 

    * We saw**a 71% increase in searches for "engagement photographers" on The Knot Vendor Marketplace** the week of Taylor & Travis' engagement announcement (compared to the prior week).




## IV. Our Methodology

Sadly, we don't have Tree Paine, AKA Taylor Swift's publicist, on speed dial (yet). Which is why we want to caveat that this report is a prediction only, based on a set of assumptions. After all, Taylor and Travis could elope, throw a destination wedding abroad, or even host a deconstructed wedding. We assume that Swift and Kelce will have a _relatively_ typical wedding planning experience while tailoring aspects of their chosen events to their liking–with the help of professionals. If this is not the case: Well, the effect could not be as big, or will be distributed differently throughout the industry. **But also, what if we're right?**

### Report Methodology

To project potential financial outcomes, we developed a series of financial models designed to test a range of scenarios. The models incorporated historical performance data, third-party and internal search data, industry benchmarks and historical, proven effects such as [the effect of Swiftonomics](https://www.ustravel.org/news/taylor-swift-impact-5-months-and-5-billion) or the impact of the most recent [Royal Wedding](https://brandfinance.com/press-releases/royal-wedding-to-boost-british-economy-by-1-billion), as well as internal assumptions about key drivers such as revenue growth, market adoption, and cost structures. All projections are directional in nature, based upon specified assumptions, and intended to highlight potential ranges of financial impact rather than predict exact results.   
  
In addition, to provide the most comprehensive insights, The Knot Worldwide analyzed our own on site behavioral data between August 19, 2025 - September 8,2025 in addition to surveying our US audience of pre-engaged and engaged couples, along with wedding professionals, to get a pulse on anticipated changes and their potential impact. The Swiftification of Weddings: A Report by The Knot combines primary research from multiple studies, including a recent onsite survey of engaged and pre-engaged couples on The Knot, fielded during the first week of September 2025 (n=1,200+), an onsite survey of The Knot wedding professionals, fielded during the first week of September 2025 (n=220), and a survey of engaged and pre-engaged members of The Knot Insiders community, fielded August 28–September 1, 2025 (n=142). Respondents represent individuals from all over the country with various ethnicities, income levels, race, age, sexual orientation and gender identity.
