Details

The Bridgerton x The Knot collection speaks to couples planning a wedding inspired by the Regency era, down to every last elegant flourish. Find a design that reflects your epic romance only on The Knot.   
Let your guests know that they're in for a lavish celebration! Each guest's name and table assignment sweeps across these place cards in formal serif typography. Cresting the top are painted wisteria garden flowers, giving off romantic, Bridgerton-inspired vibes. Select how many cards you would like printed and after you’ve placed your order, a designer will send you a spreadsheet to fill out your guests' names. After you’ve placed your order, send your completed spreadsheet to help@theknot.com with your order number included in your email, and a designer will send you a digital proof of all of your cards before printing.   
A variety of meal icons are now available! If you would like to include meal info on your place cards, simply enter your guests’ meal choices to your spreadsheet, ordered by meal preference - and our designers will include them in your digital proofs.
