I went to a majestic wedding at this lovely property two years ago. The wedding party bought out the venue which created an amazing intimate feel amongst guests. The reception by...

the pool was literally out of a movie. The innkeeper Trey was delightful, paying attention to all of the guests needs. The location is bang in the middle of the action of Napa, despite the quaint, quiet ambiance of the resort.
