## How to Choose a Wedding Cake Cutting Song

Now that we've served up our favorite wedding cake cutting songs of all time, brush up on these common FAQs.

### What is the significance of cake cutting at a wedding?

Believe it or not, there's symbolism associated with [cutting the first slice of cake at your wedding](https://www.theknot.com/content/cutting-the-cake). Some believe the couple holding the knife together is a sign of their union and dual responsibility for marriage, while others believe that passing out slices of cake represents fertility and good health.

### Do you play music during the cake cutting?

Many couples choose to play a cake cutting song while they slice the cake together, since it can help draw guests' attention to the dance floor (and keep the party going with some lively energy). Your [DJ or emcee](https://www.theknot.com/content/questions-to-ask-dj) can also make an announcement before the cake cutting begins.

### What kind of music should you play during your cake cutting?

Your cake cutting song should be lighthearted, a little bit romantic and upbeat to reflect the happy moment that everyone's been waiting for: dessert. If you can find a song that somehow ties in a reference to "sweet" or "sugar," that's even better, but it's not necessary.
