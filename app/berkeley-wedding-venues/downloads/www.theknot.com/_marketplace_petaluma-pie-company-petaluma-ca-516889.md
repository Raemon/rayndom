ntastic. They were quick to respond to emails, worked with our Coordinator to deliver the pies on our wedding day, and were so accommodating with the flavors we wanted on our special day. Our guests loved the pies and we will definitely be stopping by next time we are in Petaluma.

We ordered Petaluma Pie Company for our wedding, in lieu of a wedding cake, and the pies were so delicious!!! We ordered 5 different flavors and they were each incredible. Petaluma...

Pie Co sliced the pies for us and delivered them exactly at the time we asked for, and they were all so pleasant to work with and so responsive. We did a pie tasting before we placed the order and that was also a fun experience leading up to the wedding. Highly recommend these pies for a more affordable and unique dessert experience!

I love cake more than anyone and had always pictured my wedding cake, but wow am I happy we served pies for our wedding! They were so delicious and all of our guests were raving ab...

out them! I feel like I always see leftover wedding cake at weddings, but everyone devoured the pies and many people went back for seconds. It was a really cool surprise for our guests. We displayed 20 pies (classic apple + strawberry rhubarb + triple berry) with little chalkboard signs with the flavors, next to a big tub of vanilla bean ice cream, and it couldn't have been more perfect and rustic feeling. Petaluma Pie Company was amazing and baked our initials in dough on top of the pie we cut into and added hearts to the top of all the other pies. They even delivered them to the winery to make my life easier. I couldn't have been happier and can't wait to swing by this charming place for a huge slice of the most delish pie!

We hardly had any left overs. We bought 165 mini pies and 3 large pies for display and to cut. Flavor was outstanding and they will do anything you want as long as it is in season....

Also delivered for us too!!!

We did pie in lieu of cake for our wedding and Petaluma Pie did a stellar job! We had nano, mini, and regular sized pies, everyone was commenting on how delicious they were!

We had a casual garden wedding on an August evening in Sonoma Wine Country. We wanted desserts that featured fresh, local ingredients. In addition to our cake (with local strawberr...

ies), we ordered individual pies from Petaluma Pie Company. There were many flavors to choose from, but we chose Raspberry, Gravenstein Apple, Banana Cream, and Lemon Merangue. We can also recommend Nectarine with Blackberry. We ordered the pies for pick-up the afternoon of the wedding. The pies were fresh and delicious. The only thing I would improve would be the presentation, which was fine but not quite as "picture perfect" as I've seen in some photos in "The Knot" magazine.
