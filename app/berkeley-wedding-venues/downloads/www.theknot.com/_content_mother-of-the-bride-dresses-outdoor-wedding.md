Before you can think about mother-of-the-bride dresses for an outdoor wedding, you need to think about the _role_ of the ​​mother of the bride. "We like to think of the mother of the bride's role as the 'queen of the family,'" says Slisha Kankariya, SVP of e-commerce and digital marketing at [Adrianna Papell](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=9ibcrDa*U1o&mid=47838&u1=TK-mother-of-the-bride-dresses-outdoor-wedding&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adriannapapell.com%2F), a go-to label for mothers of the bride. "She's the stately, elegant matriarch, and her look should reflect that maturity and refinement."

The rule applies to all types of weddings, but for outdoor weddings in particular, Kankariya notes a few elements to look for in [mother-of-the-bride dresses](https://www.theknot.com/content/mother-of-bride-dresses-available-now). "Hemlines shouldn't be full length because you don't want the dress to drag in the dirt or trip you on uneven terrain," she says. Plus, "a higher hem is a great way to adapt the mother-of-the-bride look for an outdoor venue. Look for a midi or a tea-length dress instead of a full-length gown." (She suggests suiting, too; a polished and unique alternative to a dress.)

FEATURED VIDEO FROM THE KNOT

As for color, don't be afraid to go bold in [outdoor wedding attire](https://www.theknot.com/content/what-to-wear-outdoor-wedding). "Deep greens are a major color story right now and will also look fantastic in an outdoor setting," Kankariya says. "Another great option is to match the scenery in florals and botanical-inspired patterns." Beyond that, though, think simple. "Lots of embellishments like a fully beaded or sequined dress would look out of place in an outdoor setting," Kankariya says. (Pro tip: Remember that the mother of the bride will be in group photos, so her look should also coordinate—or at least not clash—with the rest of the wedding party. If there's any doubt, opt for something more understated, and punch it up with [mother-of-the-bride accessories](https://www.theknot.com/content/mother-of-the-bride-accessories).) 

Finally, consider fabrication—especially when dealing with seasonal shifts or looking for the best options for winter or [summer mother-of-the-bride dresses](https://www.theknot.com/content/summer-mother-of-the-bride-dresses). "Chiffon and lace are light and airy, which makes them classic choices for warm weather weddings; for autumn and [winter mother-of-the-bride dresses](https://www.theknot.com/content/winter-mother-of-the-bride-dresses), we like heavier-weight fabrics like velvet and jacquard," Kankariya suggests.

Once you have your perfect look squared away, focus on the finishing touches. Make sure you have your dress in hand at least one month before the wedding so there's time for alterations—and in the meantime, focus on accessories. "Buy a matching shawl, wrap or jacket," Kankariya says, "and a matching umbrella to keep at the ready in case of unpredictable weather."

Below, we've considered all this and more for you, curating a list of 25 shoppable styles that check all the outdoor boxes.

## The Best Garden & Outdoor Wedding Dresses for Mother-of-the-Bride

Considering the expert advice offered by Kankariya, we rounded up 25 pretty mother-of-the-bride dresses for outdoor weddings that are sure to shine (including a handful of Kankariya's picks from Adrianna Papell). You should enjoy the shopping process (check out our guide on where to [buy a mother-of-the-bride dress](https://www.theknot.com/content/where-to-buy-mother-of-the-bride-dresses)) and find something you love—but be sure to check in with the to-be-weds. "It's always a good idea to get approval for your [mother-of-the-bride attire](https://www.theknot.com/content/mother-of-the-bride-attire) from the happy couple before purchasing," Kankariya recommends. "Avoid any issues by going straight to the source."

### 1\. Adrianna Papell Sleeveless Soutache Embroidered Midi Dress in Light Wine

[Mother-of-the-bride dress trends](https://www.theknot.com/content/mother-of-the-bride-dress-trends) come and go, but the basic principle remains the same: The look should be understated overall, but with one element that makes it stand out from the crowd—maybe a subtle embellishment or a standout color. Here, it's a chic soutache fabrication. "The soutache finishing adds intricate detail to your look while still feeling light and airy," Kankariya says. "The ribbon embroidery treatment gives soft texture to this clean A-line silhouette." **Use code THEKNOT25 for $25 off any purchase of $100 or more.**

[Springtime weddings](https://www.theknot.com/content/spring-mother-of-the-bride-dresses) call for floral infusions—and we're not just talking about the decor. Botanicals are a great print option for mother-of-the-bride garden wedding dresses (though note this chic style comes in dozens of satin charmeuse solids for other seasons, as well!). Pro tip: Make sure you know what surface the aisle will be before choosing a dress, as you'll want to avoid dragging a long hemline through dirt if possible.

Who doesn't love a shirtdress? The style gets an elevated twist in this daytime mother-of-the-bride dress for an outdoor wedding and yet still screams summer. Pair this with statement diamond pieces—a tennis necklace or sizable studs—to dress it up, or colorful and whimsical accessories to dress it down. Either way, you'll be a stunning "something blue."

Size range: 00–8 | Colors: 1

The epitome of elegance, this stunning Azazie gown is as pretty as it is practical for a mother-of-the-bride at an outdoor wedding. The hemline hovers above the floor when worn with heels, so it won't drag across the elements, the sleeves make a statement while providing warmth, and the high-neck cape-like front is a fashion moment all its own.

Size Range: 0–30, custom sizing available | Colors: 44

The idea that outdoor weddings call for a casual [dress code](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-guest-attire-cheat-sheet) has gone out the window; now, even black-tie affairs are sometimes held outdoors. If that's the case, opt for something full-length and in a darker color or rich jewel tone—but with a nod to nature. This statement style features metallic florals and is ideal for an evening event.

Size Range: 0–22 | Colors: 1

_Photo: Adrianna Papell_

"An elevated cocktail look, this sheath dress features pearlescent beading along the sleeves and collar for a glamorous jewelry-like effect," Kankariya says. It's like having built-in accessories, which is a plus for outdoor wedding dresses for the mother-of-the-bride, when less is often more. "Full princess seams ensure a sleek and defined silhouette."

Size Range: 0–20 | Colors: 2

_Photo: Tuckernuck_

Above-the-knee hems are totally acceptable—sometimes even encouraged!—at outdoor weddings, and styles like this prove that a shorter hemline can still read sophisticated and mature. The heavy jacquard fabric provides a nice contrast to bare legs, and the puff sleeves are a modern and elevated detail.

Size Range: XXS–XXXL | Colors: 6

### 8\. Saylor NYC Brea Short-Sleeve V-Neck Midi Dress

_Photo: Anthropologie_

If figure-flattering is high on the checklist, start with wrap-dress styles or styles inspired by the silhouette. This one in a rich reddish-purple hue (we love a jewel tone for outdoor weddings) comes in petite and plus sizes and has a subtle pattern that adds interest. Plus, the midi hemline is ideal for a mother-of-the-bride outdoor wedding dress.

Size Range: Petite XS–L; Plus 1X–3X | Colors: 1

_Photo: Sachin & Babi_

Evening and cool-weather weddings call for darker tones—and shrugs! Look for a matching set to truly elevate your look, like this combination from Sachin & Babi. The shawl can be worn for the outdoor elements, such as the ceremony, and then removed once you hit the dance floor.

Size Range: 0–22 (dress); S/M–L/XL (coat) | Colors: 1 (dress); 18 (shawl)

[Dress: $795 | Sachin & Babi](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=9ibcrDa*U1o&mid=52872&u1=TK-mother-of-the-bride-dresses-outdoor-wedding&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sachinandbabi.com%2Fproducts%2Fmarsden-gown-noir-bouquet)

### 10\. Amsale Floral Hand-Beaded Appliqué Dress in Lime

_Photo: Amsale_

A summer stunner and, yes, a major splurge, this handmade dress is worth the hype, with intricate beaded appliqués and a perfectly tailored fit made-to-order. Long known for its stunning bridal gowns, Amsale has put a fresh focus on evening wear and has become one of our go-to choices for mother-of-the-bride attire. Plus, notes Kankariya, "A light touch of embellishment, like ruffles or a beaded accent, can set apart an evening look from a day look."

Size Range: 00–28 | Colors: 1

[$4,200 | Amsale](https://amsale.com/products/p725-lime)

_Photo: Sachin & Babi_

Rendered in a lightweight crinkle georgette, this floaty floral maxi has destination mother-of-the-bride vibes (we're envisioning it at an outdoor wedding along a lake or on the East Coast). As noted by Kankariya, though, MOBs should look cohesive with the rest of the wedding party as they may appear in photographs together; make sure to get sign-off from the to-be-weds for boldly patterned looks like this one.

Size Range: 0–22W | Colors: 23

_Photo: Azazie_

This half-sleeve mother-of-the-bride dress is available in an astonishing 38 different colorways; for outdoor weddings, we recommend something earthy, like this reddish terracotta hue or a trending forest green. Regardless of color, you'll be comfortable in the floaty chiffon fabric.

For a literal interpretation of a garden theme, this mother-of-the-bride garden wedding dress is covered with joy-inducing tulips. "Jacquard fabric gives a mother-of-the-bride dress both rich texture and subtle structure," Kankariya says. "This pretty tulip pattern freshens a timeless fit-and-flare silhouette."

Suits and sets are having a major moment across the fashion board, and outdoor wedding attire for the mother of the bride is no exception. This floral colorway is fun and fresh for an outdoor occasion, and the ostrich feather hem on the trapeze top says you're ready to party in celebration.

This stellar dress combines the look of eveningwear with an outdoor-appropriate tea-length hemline, making it a mother-of-the-bride option that checks all the boxes (and with deep midnight or blushy rose colorway options, it fits into any season). The oversized rosette detail at the shoulder makes a statement that you're an important figure in the wedding.

This is one of our favorite mother-of-the-bride dresses for an outdoor wedding in the spring or summer—it transitions seamlessly from a daytime garden ceremony to an alfresco evening reception. The piece is lined in pretty sky blue except for at the high neck, where cutout lace adds visual interest. Little to no accessorizing is needed; just add a cool clutch to carry the essentials.

When shopping for mother-of-the-bride casual outdoor wedding dresses, look for mixed fabrics; you can mix in materials that otherwise might be deemed not dressy enough in a way that is interesting and chic. This one is a particular favorite for outdoor evening weddings, when the temperature is about to drop, with a knit top and taffeta skirt (it hits a few top trends, too, with its drop waist and bubble hem). Add a sparkling diamond choker. 

Size Range: XS–XL | Colors: 2

Here, "a classic beaded mother-of-the-bride look gets a modern midi makeover," Kankariya says. "The sheer and beaded details around the V-neckline create a lovely face-framing moment." The look has just the right amount of embellishment, and a dark color palette that's ideal for fall outdoor weddings.

Though the brand is best known for prints and patterns more fitting for the golf course or pool than the wedding day, Lilly Pulitzer has a few mother-of-the-bride tricks up its sleeve. This on-trend column gown with chic shoulder details is a stunning summer MOB dress for an outdoor wedding. Pair it with platform wedges and a raffia clutch. 

Size Range: 00–16 | Colors: 2

Some of the best mother-of-the-bride dresses for an outdoor wedding nod to nature or fit seamlessly into the setting, and that can certainly be said for this organic-feeling Mac Duggal dress. Its mesh overlay has a floral print, and the all-over fringe detailing gives it a textural touch.

Something that's often forgotten: Mothers of the bride have lots of jobs to do throughout the day, so there's an element of functionality that is important in styling, too. Here, "the full skirt and adjustable sash-tie belt are not only flattering, but extremely comfortable for busy wedding day preparations," Kankariya says. "The iridescent taffeta fabric offers lightweight structure for this elevated shirtdress style." 

Size Range: 0–20 | Colors: 1

A high-low hem offers all the formal sophistication of a full-length gown with added ease for walking, especially on uneven outdoor surfaces; this one by Theia is especially subtle, but still shows off a stellar shoe. Here, a weighty jacquard and rich color palette is perfect for autumn or even winter outdoor weddings. 

Size Range: 0–16 | Colors: 1

For destination mother-of-the-bride dresses, look for hues that play off the sand or surf or sun, like this peachy shade. Its delicate laser-cut lace adds a formal touch to the otherwise casual shirt-dress style, and a sash at the middle defines the waist for a flattering finish. 

Size Range: 0–16 | Colors: 1
