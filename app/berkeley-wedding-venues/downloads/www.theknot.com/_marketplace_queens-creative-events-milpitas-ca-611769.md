Queen Quiocho

Owner

I started planning events back in 2001, and back then I spent most of my time hunting for the best deals. Funny thing is—I still do! Why? Because I truly get what it means to work within a budget and make every dollar count. One of my favorite parts of this work is sitting down with couples and hearing what they dream their day will look like. We love keeping the process fun, relaxed, and as stress-free as possible. I’d love to connect with you soon. Click here to schedule a video call with us - https://koalendar.com/events/meet-with-queen-quiocho.

Working with Queen was such an excellent experience. She was so organized and helped keep me calm during the last 3 months of the wedding planning process. Where her skills and pre...

sence really shined was during the actual wedding weekend. She ran a very smooth and efficient rehearsal for us, which is where I realized how stress-free I felt. That was very unexpected for me as I was worried I’d feel anxious the whole time. But Queen was so capable that she made both of us feel like we were in good hands, and I was shockingly relaxed! The day of the wedding went so smoothly and was as close to perfect as it could get. Queen’s calm energy helped keep our nerves at bay, and her attention to detail made us confident that we could hand the reigns to her and enjoy the day. My parents and wedding party were also extremely impressed with her efficiency and competence. Thank you so much, Queen!

ed. Queen met with us several time to make sure we were staying on top deadlines and helped us build out our day-of timeline, which is something I was personally dreading but she made easy and straight forward. She offered us lots of tips and suggestions, helped communicate with vendors & assist with some decor setup, and made sure our license was signed, sealed, and delivered. We can’t thank Queen enough for all her help to make the day run smoothly! We’d recommend her to anyone looking for a wedding coordinator!!

rything together seamlessly. She offered creative solutions when we felt stuck between different options, while maintaining an incredibly positive and collaborative approach throughout the entire process. Our wedding was more DIY, and Queen was completely supportive of helping us execute our vision without any judgment on our choices. What impressed us most was her grounding presence - she had this amazing ability to keep us calm and confident, no matter what challenges arose. Her communication was super quick and we felt supported every step of the way. Queen is the reason we could actually relax in the month leading up to the wedding! Queen and her team truly executed our wedding day perfectly. She had brilliant ideas for staging that allowed for a quick and smooth turnover from ceremony to reception at our venue. She followed all of our intricate instructions about setup and breakdown, ensuring everything was exactly where it needed to be and properly packed up at the end of the night. Most importantly, Queen removed stress rather than adding to our plate. She made us feel completely at peace, knowing that every detail was in capable hands. We felt like we had a true partner on our team who genuinely cared about making our day perfect. We couldn't have asked for anyone better and are so grateful we had her by our side!

Queen was amazing and we never would’ve been able to pull off our wedding without her help. Her guidance was essential. She helped us find a caterer, bartender, DJ, photographer,...

etc.; basically everything we needed. She had back up plans for every problem we encountered. When we realized we forgot coolers for the drinks, she was ready with a cooler. When we had problems with our invitations, she was ready with a backup. She had solutions to problems we couldn’t even imagine. She was an absolute lifesaver and we can’t recommend her enough.

Queen is a fantastic, supportive, and flexible planner. The month-to-day-of coordination package was perfect for us as our venue provided some coordination/planning as well. Queen ...

took a lot of the day-of pressure away, allowing us the freedom to enjoy the day stress free. Any surprises or unanswered questions that popped up were quickly dealt with, and she made sure everything was in place beforehand so we didn't need to worry about anything else on the big day. She also made planning and coordinating things outside of what our venue provided easy and painless. Both on the day of the wedding and in the time leading up to it, she was responsive and flexible. Along with our regular planned calls, she was also quick to reply to our texts for wedding recommendations and advice. We would highly recommend Queen to anyone who wants the peace of mind to know that the day of their wedding will go smoothly and worry-free.

Queen was our Month-of Planner and Coordinator for our July 2023 wedding of 100+ guests in Mill Valley and it was one of the best decisions we made. We are so grateful for her and ...

everything she did for us–we would have been lost, stressed, confused, overwhelmed had it not been for her presence and expertise. Queen is incredible: a consummate professional and expert, highly skilled, warm and caring, funny, and calming and reassuring. Queen’s Creative Events team delivered above and beyond the months leading up to our wedding through the day of our wedding. If you’re in the Bay Area and are looking for a Planner / Coordinator, Queen’s Creative Events is your answer. We cannot thank Queen enough, and highly recommend Queen’s Creative Events! From our very first meeting, Queen was warm, friendly, and knowledgeable, and also very understanding. When our three-month mark started, Queen was right on schedule in communicating with us and sharing all of the resources available to us through her services. Aisleplanner, an online tool provided by Queen, was super helpful for us to be able to use for our own planning purposes and also in being able to share the seating chart and contact with Queen and her team. She kept us on schedule with major milestones, check-in calls, answered many of our questions and also brought up many considerations that never crossed our minds (neither of us having wedding planning experience lol). Apart from being organized and helping us to project manage, Queen’s warmth and calming presence was deeply appreciated by the both of us. We had a few ideals and vision guiding our wedding that meant more freedom but also a lot more DIYing and project management. To have an expert who is kind and reassuring like Queen on our team meant a great deal to us and had a huge positive impact on our planning and our day. Even if we felt overwhelmed coming to a call, things always felt more manageable and reasonable after our conversations with Queen. For our offsite rehearsal, Queen even rearranged the furniture of the space we were in to replicate the ceremony setup! She guided us through many little details that would have been easily overlooked, while keeping it light and fun for everyone. Our sisters, who officiated the wedding, and our parents all commented during and after what a difference it makes to have Queen guide us, to have someone with that caliber of experience on our day. Finally, on our day itself, we had the best time of our lives surrounded by loved ones and a big reason why we were able to enjoy our day as carefree as we did was due to the magic of Queen and her team. Queen ensured everything went as smoothly as possible, checked in with us on decisions that were dependent on our feelings and mood at that moment, and she took such good care of us to make sure we were eating and drinking enough. She and her team were flexible to adapt to unexpected circumstances or situations (which inevitably arise), and had the preparation and experience to avoid and mitigate any issues in advance. With our budget, Queen and her team stepped up in ways that are beyond words–we are so incredibly grateful. Thank you so much Queen for making our day as special as it was with your superpowers!!! We appreciate you so much and our families are also very grateful for you making our day.

I need to do to plan the wedding, but she guided me with every detail and even gave amazing ideas and recommendations. Her professional, long years of experience in her field definitely shows when you work with her. She’s so friendly, caring, and genuine that I am a bit sad it was over. The day-of, I was so stressed out if everything is in order. Having Queen there drove all my worries away. I was able to just focus on enjoying the day. Thanks Queen for making our day so special. Highly recommended. You won’t regret it working with Queen!

My husband and I were very happy with Queen's wedding planning and execution services and most definitely recommend her for your SF bay area wedding! Queen is an absolute pleasure...

to work with - she's very amiable and professional. She helped us pull our wedding together in less than 5 months (we reached out to her at the end of May and by mid October of the same year, we got married). She helps you stay on track with all of the intricacies of planning. And more importantly, saves you whenever a crisis occurs (ours included finding out 3 days before the event that the oven at the venue was broken). Most importantly, she makes sure your day runs smoothly and on time. She shouldered all burdens of coordinating vendors with so they would know what they needed to do when and where. It meant that my husband, myself, and our families were able to enjoy the day worry free. Thank you so much Queen!

If the Knot had six, seven...two hundred star options, it wouldn't be enough. Queen (owner) is phenomenal. She is not just incredibly organized, patient, and supportive but she r...

eally emphasizes that she wants you to not have to worry about anything* on your wedding day. And you don't, when you have Queen. My family didn't have to worry about anything...my husband was supported...and so was I. Everything went on behind the scenes and was absolutely perfect. And I just hired her for the "day of coordinator." To be honest, I could have used her for more so I would go with a more comprehensive package but if that's all money will allow, do the day of package! This is something you will never, ever regret. My sister also used Queen's services and support 7 years ago and I will be referring everyone I know to her for the rest of my LIFE. She's absolutely amazing and your wedding will be a day of more not less, love not stress!

went above and beyond what I could have ever asked for she took my ideas and expanded them in ways I could not. She was organized and kept me in the loop about everything. Anytime I needed help finding a vendor or even when & where I should get my marriage license she helped me with it all she made it easy so that I didn’t have to spend hours searching. I trust her & the vendors that she provided me with were amazing from the florist to the DJ! She held my hand through it all. Queen took care of me & my family making things easy for them as well. She killed it the day of the wedding I didn’t worry about a single thing & I was able to relax & enjoy the moment. As I said Queen did both my wedding & bridal shower I would recommend her to anyone who is having a special event happening in there life you will never forget a Queens Create Events, event!

ON @ PV Queen was an amazing part of our special day. We initially tried doing without a planner but our venue required it. So we were so lucky to find her at the last minute. ...

From our first encounter her professionalism and punctuality to planning or first meeting was great. She was patient, accommodating and affordable to our budget plan. She made our wedding event incredibly stress free, from the day we signed our contract with her to the end, she went over and beyond with services needed and reaching all vendors to make sure everyone was on the same page and on the top of things for our wishes to be met. During the wedding while we were both nervous and anxious she was so calm and composed she kept us informed with the process and steps along the way, she brought us water and snacks. She was simply amazing, we would use her again and again. Matter fact at the end of the event, we all said, let’s do this again. Lol … My wife and I strongly recommend her for your wedding…. She is amazing…. ❤️❤️❤️❤️ Thank you once again Queen 👑 for making our day so special…

Queen and her team were so amazing -- they even took over some roles from the catering staff when they were a complete failure at my wedding -- AND for the most part, I had not even realized there was a problem because Queen's team was so competent, thoughtful, and efficient.

My husband and I immediately started planning for our wedding once we were engaged and were so eager to share our happiness with friends and family. Our plans for our special day ...

came to a halt when a few major life events had taken place for us and we were no longer able to host the dream wedding we had planned so long for. We decided to get married in 2012 and left the idea of having a wedding behind. Luckily, I found QCE through a great friend of mine and it was a true blessing. In talking with Queen at QCE, she helped my husband and I realize that you can still celebrate your big day, even years later, and it still be just as meaningful and special as the day we got married. After checking out their website and looking through photos from previous events, their was not doubt in our minds we would use QCE for our Wedding/Vow Renewal. Everything looked so elegant and carefully executed. In our consultation with Queen, she managed to take the initial ideas we envisioned for our event and enhance them. Some of her ideas were even better than what we originally had planned! We just know that our wedding will be nothing short of spectacular and are eager to begin planning. A big thank you goes out to QCE for restoring our hope and excitement again. We just can't wait!

heir hearts and creative minds into every detail with story boards, show room models, and many many test trials. I've seen QCE turn their homes, garages, and extra space into showroom models full of creative ideas and candid conversations about their clients vision and dreams. I think the best quality and characteristic of the QCE Team is that they work smart and hard for their clients while still managing the care of their families. Yes I've witnessed QCE take care of their children, cook for their families, and late in the night pull out the ribbons, glitter, flowers, charms etc.making sure every detail is right, every venue secured, and every vendor confirmed. I have the pleasure of witnessing QCE in action behind the scenes because Queen is my beautiful loving wife and the best mother around. Now that makes a great event planner, multitasker, and dream engineer!
