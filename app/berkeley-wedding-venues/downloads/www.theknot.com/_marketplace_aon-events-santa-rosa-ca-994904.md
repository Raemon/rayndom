Danny Aon

Owner

Hello and thanks for visiting - here's a quick bio! My original career plan was to be a professional musician, but when I discovered DJing (around 2005 living in Los Angeles), I had found my true calling. Once I was skilled enough to become a full time working DJ (around 2009), I DJ'd the club scene in LA and after moving to San Diego in 2013, continued DJing clubs (while also expanding into weddings, corporate events and poolsides/casinos). Fast forward to 2023 (and over 400 weddings later!), my wife and I relocated to Sonoma County and we love working with all the venues and couples up here!

DJ Danny Aon did such an incredible job DJing and MCing our wedding! My husband and I have sent each other love songs ever since we started dating, and I have always added them all...

into a very special YouTube playlist over the years. When it came time for our wedding, seven years later, we knew these 140 songs just had to be our wedding soundtrack, for the entire day. We spoke to a whole bunch of wedding DJs, and so many were not able, willing, or knowledgeable enough in our music styles to be able to work with the request, but DJ Danny was so incredibly amazing at sorting and organizing all of our music in such a beautiful way that made absolute sense for each portion of our magical day. He filled the gaps with songs that fit the style, and was willing to let us forego the top hits and wedding standards to make our punk, soul, r&b, indie wedding dream come to life so beautifully. He worked with our day of coordinator so perfectly, hit every mark, highlighted every moment, and pulled off every single portion of the day with such leadership, confidence, and energy. The sound quality was perfect in every space, and through every portion of the day. The photobooth and even the photo strips were customizable, high quality, and the attendant was so great and friendly! Danny even took some awesome photos and videos from his own phone that he shared with us after the big day, which were SO PRICELESS because we did not have a videographer. SO SO SO amazing all around!!! Us, our family, and our guests all had such an amazing time, and this is in huge part thanks to Danny's amazing skills. It's amazing just how much the perfect DJ/MC can add to your wedding day or special event. We one million percent recommend hiring Aon Events!

Overall, we were very happy with our DJ and photobooth! The music throughout the night kept the energy high, and our guests had such a great time on the dance floor. The photobooth...

digital images were excellent quality and such a fun addition to the reception. That said, there were a few small hiccups worth mentioning for future couples: \- Typically guests are asked to stand before the bride walks down the aisle, but that wasn’t prompted, and a few guests mentioned being unsure whether to sit or stand. \- During our first dance, the DJ started the song while he was still speaking, which threw off our choreography slightly since we’d planned to begin from the very start. \- The photobooth printouts weren’t as sharp as the digital photos — I’d probably ask for a sample print next time. These were all minor things that could’ve been avoided with clearer communication on both sides. Overall though, we’re still really happy with how everything turned out and would recommend them!

Hi Jenn! Thank you for your review and feedback! It was great being a part of your wedding...

and I remember the dance floor as one of the best of the summer! I definately do aim to make sure each wedding is 100% perfect, and I have made some updates since your email (and post) to improve on those three points you mentioned. So to address those: For the 'please stand' announcement during the ceremony, most often it's the officiant who will say that, and then to further add to the variability, sometimes couples will request to skip the 'please stand' announcement altogether (as sometimes guests have mobility issues or for other reasons). So as you mentioned, communication really is the key the getting that part right, and I should have double checked with the officiant during the sound check. Since your wedding though, I have made sure to confirm with each officiant during the soundcheck, and have also added a prompt into the planning form as well as an extra step. Since I DJ so many weddings each year, I think what happens is we can fall into patterns and default settings (based on most common experiences), and assuming the officiant would cover that announcement was definately one of those. Regarding the first dance emcee and song start times, I do have detailed notes with me during the wedding - but I somewhow missed that note and went into my default mode (which is to start the song during my emcee introduction). So yes, totally my error. To minimize the chance of that in the future, I've updated the day-of notes template (that I bring with me) to add extra highlighting to details such as those, so hopefully that should avoid that for future moments like that. And finally regarding the photo strip print outs, I hadn't heard that before from any previous clients, but as we've been improving the quality of our photo images (recently we upgraded to a high-end camera lens as well as an improved flash and diffuser), I can see how the photo strips might not look as sharp as the improved digital images. We use the industry standard printer, and I would say the top priority for a photo booth printer is it's speed (as the longer a print takes, the slower the line moves). I did however look into options for improving resolution (while still keeping the print out speed within acceptable range), and I found that through the driver settings there is an option setting for 'maximum resolution'. I tested that setting out and it and was happy to find that it only added about 1.5 seconds of time to the prints (while markedly increasing the resolution!). Thank you again for mentioning that, as I feel that definately will improve all future events and have the strips looking just as good as the digital images! If you would like me to reprint the photo strips at the new settings I can definately mail them to you :) Thanks again for the feedback and thank you for having us be a part of your wedding day!

Not that we will ever again need a wedding DJ, but Danny (Aon Events) did an EXCELLENT job for our special day. The venue was being a bit difficult with setup, and he adjusted so ...

quickly we didn’t even notice! He was detailed, responsive, and professional throughout the whole planning process which allowed our wedding and reception to happen seamlessly. His planning portal and schedule was better than what was offered by our coordinator! We asked him to supplement the various playlists (cocktail hour, dinner, and dancing) based on his experience/professional judgement, which allowed for the perfect atmosphere all night. We cannot recommend him enough for any wedding or event that needs a DJ and/or photo booth!

Danny did a great job at our wedding! Beforehand, my husband and I knew nothing about wedding details or protocol and Danny was extremely helpful walking us through the process and...

giving us advice along the way. We had a lot of song requests and Danny did such a great job weaving them in throughout the night. I realized that we would not hear every single song on our list but I was amazed at the high number he was able to include. I was also so impressed with his ability to read the room and adapt the type of music he was playing to who was there and on the dance floor. He was so friendly, professional, and accommodating with our guests. If we were to do this all over again, I would definitely work with Danny again and cannot recommend him enough.

My husband and I are so happy we chose Danny to be our DJ for our wedding. From the very first intro call, I could tell Danny was a professional in his craft and had a ton of exper...

ience to bring to our big day. He took the time to understand the priorities and vibes we wanted for our wedding, and provided honest and transparent guidance with any questions we had! Danny was extremely organized throughout the entire planning process through to the end of the wedding night. All of the planning was done through a bespoke portal that really helped my husband and I feel great about how the events and major moments throughout the day and night would be executed. And they were executed flawlessly! While we had some must-play songs, we really left it to Danny and trusted him on the song selections and I am so glad we did! I remember telling Danny a main concern I had was an empty dancefloor given how intimate the wedding would be (70 guests total), but it was quite the opposite! Everyone was on the dancefloor a majority of the night - from a toddler cousin to grandparents - everyone was dancing. I truly believe it was because Danny has such a talent for reading the room & vibes and choosing music that slows down or pump ups the energy according to the timeline and key moments. What I really appreciated was Danny's flexibility in coordinating a karaoke-style Italian song that my dad wanted to sing in lieu of a speech. Danny was super accommodating in the logistics for this and helping my dad feel comfortable. Danny exceeded our expectations and it was evident he was invested in our big day; I could tell he wanted to make sure everything flowed smoothly from ceremony, to cocktail hour, to the reception. Another perk of having Danny as our DJ was the add-on photobooth service he provides! This was a last minute decision for us but I am so happy we ended up booking the photobooth with Danny - it was such a great activity for our guests. And in addition to the photo strips, Danny also gave us access to the full photobooth gallery! We cannot recommend Danny/Aon Events enough as your wedding DJ and MC. Thank you Danny for helping make our wedding as amazing as it was!

Danny made our wedding night truly unforgettable. From the moment we first connected with him, he was an absolute pleasure to work with. His professionalism and attention to detai...

l were evident throughout the entire process. Danny did the sound for our ceremony, cocktail hour and reception and the transition between the events was seamless. We were also able to get cold sparks for our first dance and grand entrance which was a huge plus. Another advantage was that Danny also offered a photobooth service. Although the photobooth was not placed where we had discussed (Moved by the venue not Danny), it was still a blast and we had many laughs going through all the photos our guests took. The whole process was very easy. The online song selection portal he offered was a game-changer. It allowed us to easily curate our playlist, ensuring that every song played was a meaningful addition to our big day. Danny's flexibility and willingness to accommodate our musical preferences made the experience even more enjoyable. What truly sets Danny apart is his ability to read the crowd and keep the dance floor alive. His music selection was spot on, and he had everyone from the youngest to the oldest guests on their feet and dancing the night away. We couldn't be happier with our choice of DJ and wholeheartedly recommend him to anyone looking for a DJ who goes above and beyond to make your wedding day unforgettable. Thank you, DJ Danny!

Photo Booth. They were an amazing team to work with throughout the entire process. From the planning ahead, to customizing the Photo Booth, to curating the music to our likes and requirements, and providing a website for our guests to access the photos from the photo booth - AON events absolutely hit it out of the park. Our guests loved AON Events so much, it was the talk of the wedding! We had so many compliments that this was the best music played at a wedding, ever! We even had guests asking for Danny's contact information and if he would travel for their wedding! They handled the complexities of our venue like a pro with our multiple venue spaces, both indoor and outdoor. Brought the mood to every part of the wedding with the perfect music for the setting and highlighted our venue space with great lighting. The photo booth was so much fun and had tons of accessories for our guests. We couldn't recommend AON events for your wedding any more! Overall, they have tons of service options, they're great to work with, and are highly experienced.

ch included audio coverage during the ceremony, cocktail hour, DJ services during the reception, and a photobooth. Throughout the entire planning process, Danny's communication was top-notch, and we felt at ease working with him. A few weeks before our wedding day, he proactively scheduled a call to discuss our playlists, and we were so happy with all his recommendations that helped our day flow seamlessly. Our reception was an absolute blast - Danny’s music selection was perfectly tailored to our preferences, and he effortlessly kept the dance floor alive throughout the evening. Also, the photobooth experience was such a hit among our guests! Danny also went above and beyond by sharing the full gallery of the photobooth pictures a day or so after the event, along with 15 professional-looking photos he took himself, which we (and our friends & family) appreciated immensely. Working with Danny was 100% the right decision for our wedding day, and we would recommend his services to everyone looking for a talented DJ. Thank you for making our day so perfect Danny!

ddings, and had up to date content on his social media. He had playlists and lots of information and details that we respected and took into account when choosing our DJ. He was also reasonably priced and was a great communicator through emails and on our phone calls. The day of our wedding, Danny helped set up sound and mic the Officiant and our Harpist for our ceremony. The music was bumping all night, and the night ran through pretty seamlessly. He was also super open to customizing the night by helping us include some Star Wars music and Nintendo music as well as coin SFX throughout the reception! He did a super job of making announcements and reminding the guests of important details. We also upgraded our package a few months before and added in a photobooth and had awesome uplighting that really added to the ambiance of our reception. So many of our friends and family complimented his professionalism and the sound quality. We wished the night could have kept going and we had even more time to dance! Our event was a blast and we highly recommend Danny if you are looking for a DJ in San Diego or Northern CA! 🙂 Our photographer took a photo with us and Danny and we will be sure to add it into our review once we get more images back! Thanks so much Danny!

But nothing beat the feeling walking into our reception and seeing his fabulous uplighting surrounding our reception tent, and hearing all our most personal and favorite songs played exactly as we’d hoped all night long perfectly mixed with his announcing! He had a great voice for it and just kept us guided through the night perfectly as we’d imagined.

when putting in our song selections and had a wide variety of selections. We didn't serve any alcohol at our wedding and had a fear that nobody would be on the dance floor -- Danny made sure that didn't happen! He was able to keep the dance floor hopping all night and the majority of our guests stayed until the end of the night dancing the night away. He was able to read the crowd and select the music based on what he felt would be best (but also took any suggestions from my husband and me). His MC'ing skills were also wonderful and he was interactive with the crowd. Would 100% recommend Danny for any wedding or event! Thank you, Danny!
