## What Is the Best Wedding Dress Shopping Outfit?

When it comes to what to wear bridal dress shopping, there's no "one size fits all" solution. What matters most is that you feel comfortable and confident during your [bridal appointment](https://www.theknot.com/content/questions-to-ask-bridal-consultant). Of course, you'll want your shopping experience to be as seamless as possible, so you should avoid wearing anything that's difficult to change in and out of. Excessive layers and outfits with intricate buttons are a no-go when deciding what to wear to try on wedding dresses. Instead, opt for something you can easily slip off when you get into the dressing room. A flowy dress or a midi skirt with a blouse are both great options. Refer to the handy-dandy infographic below for more expert advice on what to wear to try on wedding gowns. **Psst:** You can tap the heart on the top right corner to save it to your favorites folder on [The Knot App](https://theknot.app.link/AfU7ISLGuUb) so you can refer back to it later.

## What to Wear Wedding Dress Shopping

When thinking about what to wear to wedding dress shopping, try not to stress too much about your outfit. What matters most is what you wear underneath. Since you'll be trying on a variety of [wedding dress styles](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-dress-silhouettes), you'll want to keep your base simple. Below, I've broken down exactly what to wear to a bridal appointment and why.

### Neutral Underwear or Shapewear

When you're trying on dress after dress, you want to feel comfortable and confident in your underwear of choice. "When trying on wedding gowns, it's best to wear what you think you'd wear under your wedding dress on the big day. For example, if you usually prefer Spanx when wearing dresses, be sure to bring your favorite pair," recommends Beth Chapman, founder and stylist of [Beth Chapman Styling and Consulting](https://www.bethchapmanstyling.com/) and owner of [The White Dress by The Shore](https://www.thewhitedressbytheshore.com/) in Clinton, Connecticut. Whether or not you prefer [wedding dress shapewear](https://www.theknot.com/content/under-thewedding-dress-lingerie-essentials), the undergarments you bring should be a neutral color and free of any bulky embellishments that could show through the dresses you try on. "We recommend, if any, very thin shapewear. Or, if you do not want to wear shapewear, [nude underwear](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-dress-underwear)," advises Amy Hidalgo, manager and stylist at [Bridal Boutique](https://www.bridalboutiquelewisville.com/) in Lewisville, Texas. BTW: Dress shopping is not the time to don your sexy [bridal lingerie](https://www.theknot.com/content/lingerie-types), so save the corset and garters for your honeymoon (wink).

### A Comfortable Nude Bra

Don't stress over finding the perfect bra before your shopping appointment. The best thing you can do is simply bring a comfortable nude bra that you already own and can try on with different dresses as needed. If you're planning on trying on dresses with strapless or plunging necklines, you could even skip the bra altogether and opt for a pair of [nipple covers](https://www.theknot.com/content/best-nipple-covers) instead (so long, straps!).

Based on the dress you pick, your bridal consultant will advise you on the best kind of bra for each dress you try on. Many wedding dresses contain structural elements like boning, padding, corsetry, linings and interlinings, which make wearing a bra unnecessary. 

### Your Wedding Shoes

Unless you already _know_ that you'll be wearing [bridal flats](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-day-flats) for your wedding, I definitely recommend bringing a pair of heeled shoes to your dress shopping appointment. "If you are going to wear heels at your wedding, they will help you see how the gown will fit on your day," says Hidalgo. While you don't necessarily have to bring the exact pair of [wedding shoes](https://www.theknot.com/content/best-wedding-shoes) you'll wear on the big day, you should try to bring a pair that has a similar heel height.

### Your Hair and Makeup Done

As a bridal beauty editor, I am a huge advocate for wearing as little or as much makeup as will make you feel good. There's no right or wrong answer to how much makeup you should wear when trying on wedding dresses. When I went shopping for my own dress, I chose to wear makeup that enhanced my complexion that I knew would make me feel good when I looked in the mirror. Plus, I knew my mom would want to take some pictures! Another advantage of wearing makeup to your shopping appointment? It will help you avoid looking washed out under the harsh store lighting. If I were to do the process all over again, I would consider having both my makeup _and_ hair done to get the full bridal effect. (Dress shopping is a great opportunity to test out different [makeup products](https://www.theknot.com/content/beauty-faves-from-real-brides) and [wedding hairstyles](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-hairstyles-you-will-love).)

### Minimal Jewelry

While chunky jewelry is the moment right now, it's best to leave it at home when bridal dress shopping. When it comes to what to wear when trying on wedding dresses, a simple pair of studs or small hoops and your engagement ring are all you need to complete your OOTD. Excessive jewelry can be distracting and take away from the neckline and details of the dress while you're trying to make the big decision. Keeping your jewelry light allows you to more easily try on different accessories they have in-store and get insights from your stylist about [what jewelry to wear with your wedding dress](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-to-pick-jewelry-to-match-your-wedding-dress).

### A Hair Clip or Scrunchie

When thinking about what to take wedding dress shopping, a hair clip or scrunchie is an absolute must. Since you'll be trying on many different dresses, you'll want to have a hair tie or clip handy so you can put your hair up while you're changing in and out of gowns. It can also be a helpful way to visualize how a dress will look with an updo as opposed to with your hair down. Remember, hair has the power to completely transform a look, so it's important to preview various style combinations.
