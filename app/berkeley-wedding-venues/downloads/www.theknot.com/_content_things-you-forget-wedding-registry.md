Don't be afraid to have a little fun while you're building your registry shopping list. No rule says you can't ask for unique decor pieces as wedding gifts. Adding a vintage-style area rug to the living room can change the look and feel of the space, as can a colorful new accent chair or even a statement mirror. Adding wedding registry gifts that focus on style is always a good idea. For example, we love this striped accent rug that comes in a variety of sizes to fit any home.

When people think of a wedding registry, they think about fine china and baking pans. But a home needs more than pretty flatware and kitchen tools to function effectively. Consider other rooms of the house that could use some TLC too, like your bathroom. Chances are you've got a ton of old and mismatched bath towels hanging on by a (literal) thread, so don't let them be wedding registry items you forget. Grab a new set of super-soft, 100% organic cotton towels that'll give you a spa-like feel when you step out of the shower.

Bedding sets are definitely wedding registry items no one thinks of but take a moment to consider what you're working with. Chances are, you've got pieces in your linen closet that get the job done. But if you've slept on silky-soft sheets with a high thread count before, you know there's a difference between good enough sheets and amazing sheets. Your wedding is the perfect time to level up your bedding game, so why not grab this 400-thread count cotton sheet set?

[From $64 | The Knot](https://www.theknot.com/registry/store/products/regatta-400-thread-count-sheet-set-1?id=147029)

The best [kitchen wedding registry items](https://www.theknot.com/content/kitchen-wedding-registry-picks) are the ones that pull double duty, especially if you're tight on space. This countertop product can blend shakes, sauces, soups and more and has a handy travel cup you can make things in and take to-go. In addition to a blender, every couple should get a [food processor](https://www.theknot.com/registry/store/products/3-5-cup-mini-food-processor?id=82805) so you can make tasty salad dressings, hummus and guacamole with the push of a button.

Arguably, the most forgotten wedding registry items are car care supplies. Whether it's a battery charger to jump-start your car or a portable tire pump, include a few items from this category on your list. To help keep your vehicle clean and looking as good as new, we suggest getting this detailing kit that comes with 22 pieces, like a window scraper, duster gloves and a collapsible bucket.

## 6\. Cash Funds




Speaking of non-material gift ideas, consider the benefits of starting a [cash fund](https://www.theknot.com/content/cash-registry-the-newlywed-fund) for something you need or want. Luckily, [The Knot Wedding Registry](https://www.theknot.com/registry) makes it super simple to start a cash fund for virtually anything.

Aside from being nice to look at, cast iron cookware has a lot of benefits. Cast iron pieces can maintain high temperatures while baking and are typically toxin-free. If you only add one cast iron item to your wedding registry, make it a Dutch oven. This versatile pot can be used for baking, roasting, searing and even deep-frying practically anything. It's also great for making soups, stews and sauces that need a long time to simmer.

[From $350 | The Knot](https://www.theknot.com/registry/store/products/cast-iron-round-dutch-oven-with-lid-257?id=101549)

## 9\. Food Storage Containers

It's time to toss your old, slightly warped and definitely not BPA-safe plastic food containers. (Yes, the ones you got for free every time you ordered takeout and never got rid of.) The truth is, they take up way more space in your kitchen than they should, are constantly tumbling out at you whenever you open the cabinets and it's nearly impossible to find a lid that fits. Start over with this complete set that's easy to stack, made with freezer and microwave-safe glass and has airtight lids to prevent leaks and lock in freshness.

[$110 | The Knot](https://www.theknot.com/registry/store/products/tempered-glasslock-18-container-food-storage-set-glasslock?id=181925)

## 10\. Garbage Can

You know you're finally a "real" adult when the sight of a sleek new garbage can makes you weak in the knees. Stainless steel garbage cans are surprisingly pricey and can get filled up pretty quickly. That's why this roomy model with dual compartments is probably your best option. It will allow you to separate your regular garbage from your recyclables and look stylish while doing it.

If you're still scratching your head over what else to register for and don't want to clutter up your home, reflect on what you and your partner enjoy doing in your spare time. Think about experiences like date nights at your favorite restaurants and weekend trips to a cool rental house or something simple like streaming music from your favorite platform. Gift cards allow you to include these options without choosing specific products. And yes, people often think [adding gift cards to your registry](https://www.theknot.com/content/gift-cards-wedding-registry) is one of the top three [registry mistakes](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-registry-etiquette), but they're wrong. According to The Knot 2025 Annual Registry Study, which surveyed over 5,500 people with wedding dates between March 2024 and December 2026, 34% of nearlyweds include gift cards on their wedding registry. Let gift cards to your preferred places and items be an easy addition for you and a quick pick for your loved ones.

Making a list of what you need inside the home is important, but outdoor items are often forgotten when making a wedding registry. If you've got some green space to utilize, register for this comfy four-piece patio set for you and your partner can sip your coffee, tea or cocktails on. Add an outdoor rug and a pretty string of bistro lights and voila! You've got the backyard oasis you've always dreamed of.

Registering for a cookware set doesn't have to feel like overkill. These high-quality, non-stick items will also be your go-to in the kitchen.

The collection, available in six colors, comes with three pans, a Dutch oven, pan racks and a lid holder.

When you've just moved into a new place, it's natural to focus on furniture and kitchen items first. But once the essentials are added, many people have forgotten registry items like wall decor. Adding paintings, digital prints or framed family photos to a blank wall can give a space personality and make a home truly feel like yours. Our advice? Try out this mounted picture frame so you can have a place to put all your beautiful wedding photos.

Most couples have a standard handheld mixer in their cupboards, but every home chef deserves a quality stand mixer.

Going for a do-it-all The Knot Registry Award winner like this KitchenAid, perfect for those [overwhelmed by other wedding registry](https://www.theknot.com/content/registry-awards) options, will always be the right choice since it can spiralize veggies, make sheets of pasta and churn ice cream.

Bought a new home or plan on trying some DIY projects? Then, a proper tool set and a toolbox to keep it all contained is a must. Most people tend to acquire bits and pieces over the years (a screwdriver here, a wrench there), but keeping it organized will make all the difference. Consider registering for this cordless tool set that includes a drill, sander, jigsaw and more.
