The holidays are getting closer which means one thing: It's advent calendar season. Finding the perfect advent calendar for your girlfriend is a great way to help her count down to Christmas. Plus, she'll think of you every time she opens her daily surprise. While classic chocolates are always popular, there are so many other advent calendar gift ideas for her. We've scrolled through countless sites to find the best ones, from makeup and jewelry to candles and coffee.

The golden rule for choosing advent calendars for her? Don't wait! Unlike [stocking stuffers for your girlfriend](https://www.theknot.com/content/girlfriend-stocking-stuffers), you can't leave advent calendar shopping until the last minute. The most coveted calendars always sell out early, so if you see one you know she'll love, grab it quickly. (The same goes for [advent calendars for couples](https://www.theknot.com/content/couples-advent-calendars) if you're looking for something to share.)
