thing like this! Their singer was all running through the crowd, shaking it with us on the dance floor. Dude was dope! I knew every song too. They played a great mix of all the decades: Rap, Rock, Dance, Funk, Country (WTF?). They even did LIVE KARAOKE to close the night out! Fun, but let's leave the singing to the band (haha) DEFINITELY call these dudes if you want to take your party to the next level. That's exactly what the Wonderbread is: next level!

What we hear most from our clients due to Wonder Bread 5 is, "everyone keeps telling us, our wedding was the best wedding they have ever been to." If you're looking for low maintenance with all the expectations of a high maintenance band, Wonder Bread 5 will make your party beyond your highest expectations, and your guests too!

Wonderbread 5 was such an incredible homerun for my wedding, I really don't know where to start. We were torturing ourselves over the right band choice. Lots of the bands websites ...

looked the same and our eyes were glazing over at videos of groups playing Uptown Funk, but then I learned a few key things to watch out for 1) Fake bands who send out multiple versions of the band on the same night 2) Bands who don't have consistent line ups 3) bands who just look like they want to get a pay check and go home. We looked high and low before we finally got a (last minute) recommendation for Wonderbread 5, and it was like a complete blessing for us. This band is *so so* fun and over the top exciting. The guys were absolute dolls to work with, they 1000% won over everyone at our wedding (including my great grandmother) and they just tore the house down with a fun spirit and warm, high energy. I am so thankful to the band, their management and their sound team for making so much magic happen at our wedding. Please message me if you need more detail on why this was the perfect choice. Wonder Bread 5 is GOLD. Thank you, Irene and Pat

and I started planning our wedding - they were our first phone call! Our wedding day was ideal. The energy Wonder Bread brought kept everyone out on the dance floor and their song list had something every generation could sing along with. They were interactive with all of our guests and were fantastic with the younger children. I absolutely recommend hiring them! I can't wait for the next reason to hire them again myself!

oor within seconds. While they were performing I looked at my fiancé and said “I think we found our band”. That was the best decision we made for our wedding. We were both so adamant about having them as our band that we planned everything else around their schedule. We requested an Ed Sheeran song for our first dance that wasn’t in their usual repertoire and they nailed it! Their performance that night constantly reaffirmed our decision. We even invited the band to our after party. These guys are so sweet! They posed for pictures with our guests and took time to talk to everyone. They were so much fun on and off stage, I just can’t give them enough praise! Thanks Wonder Bread 5 :-)

Wonderbread 5 was out of this world and their performance surpassed any of my expectations. My recommendation to any couples looking to hire them for a wedding is to not think twi...

ce and just pull the trigger! The guys made our wedding so special. Their song list rocked, their heart outfits were perfect, they kept it clean for the kids, and their engagement with the audience was spot on. The band and their team were absolutely wonderful throughout their entire time on site per feedback from the venue and coordinator. Their set up was unobtrusive, they hung out before the wedding in street clothes to maintain the surprise, they started and ended their performance on time, they were low maintenance, and their break down was one of the fastest on record at this venue. Also, they completely surprised the groom and he cannot stop talking about their performance. My favorite was when we were walking in from the second round of photos when the band started their performance. The groom realized that a band was playing and the lead singer met us up at the bocce ball court at the edge of the field with all of the kids from the wedding in tow. The groom was so surprised. It's one of my favorite wedding memories. Just this past weekend we were talking about the wedding and he said "That band was dynamite. It's one for the books, babe. It's one for the books." Many of our friends and family have said that it was the best wedding they have ever been to. I think the majority of it has to do with Wonderbread 5's amazing, tailored performance. If you are looking for a memorable, fun, and crazy dance party for your wedding you should hire them now!

any cheesy wedding bands.) We also wanted a band that wouldn't guffaw at playing a wedding but would actually enjoy it. I did some research and found few options including Wonder Bread 5. I asked around and everyone said that WB5 was the way to go. We were not disappointed. The band was awesome and fun for the young and old at our wedding. They got everybody dancing (which admittedly wasn't hard with our crowd) and even pulled a few of our guests onto stage with them. We are so thrilled that we hired this band and would recommend them to anyone and everyone. They helped to make our wedding day, according to our guests, one of the best weddings they'd ever attended.
