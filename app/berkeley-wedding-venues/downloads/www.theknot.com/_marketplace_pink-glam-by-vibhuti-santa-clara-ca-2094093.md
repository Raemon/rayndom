My wife and I both had our hair and make up trials and day of wedding looks done by Vibhuti. Three months after our trial, she remembered and implemented the changes and feedback f...

or my make up perfectly, AND was able to do dramatically different hair and make up styles for my wife. She nailed our “vibes”. I’m Indian and my wife is Korean/Chinese, and she was able to do both skin colors very well. We both looked exactly how we wanted and moreover, our styles looked perfect throughout the entire day/night, despite unexpected sweaty hot weather. Nothing needed touch ups much to my surprise! We got many compliments thanks to Vibhuti’s skill. Aside from that, Vibhuti was easy to give feedback to and work with, and her stamina to not sit or stop for 6 hours straight was impressive! We also appreciated her calm positive energy the day of. We were happy to go with Vibhuti and would do it again! Sorry the photos won’t attach!
