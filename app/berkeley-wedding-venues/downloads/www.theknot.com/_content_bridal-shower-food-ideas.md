### 2\. Charcuterie Skewers

You can never go wrong with handheld light bites when it comes to [bridal shower appetizers](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-shower-appetizers). Put the skewers of fresh fruit and cheese in paper cartons or cups so guests can grab and go.

### 3\. Raw Seafood Bar

![Seafood bar at bridal shower](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/1b1b3241-26b1-4e04-910a-9498ee849373~rs_768.h-cr_0.60.896.1255)

When hosting an outdoor event—especially near the coast—you can't go wrong with fresh seafood. "Consider an interactive seafood station paired with lots of local, seasonal offerings such as a grilled corn and cotija salad, or a tomato, peppers and chiles salad," says Shaun Roberts, chief revenue officer at NYC-based catering company [Great Performances](https://www.greatperformances.com/).

### 4\. Grazing Table

One of our favorite bridal shower menu ideas are [grazing tables](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-grazing-table). These are basically charcuterie boards, but at least two times bigger. Have fun arranging it to look like a work of art that'll impress all your guests. 

### 5\. Fruit Tarts




![Fruit tarts at bridal shower](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/4e04655b-a898-4a00-8c8d-413d71330178~rs_768.h-cr_0.60.896.1255)

Bring vibrant color to your wedding shower food table with these tasty summer desserts. Ask your baker to make the tarts full sized or into miniature bites. 

### 6\. Miniature Quiches

![Mini quiche food idea for a bridal shower. ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/1b92330d-2969-4750-99e4-77abcc36330b~rs_768.h-cr_0.116.1326.1884)

_[Photo: Q Weddings](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/q-weddings-austin-tx-302968)_




Bulk up a [bridal shower brunch](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-shower-brunch) with mini quiches. Be sure to offer a variety of flavors, including meat and veggie options, so there's something for everyone.

### 7\. Lobster Rolls

![Mini lobster roll food idea for a bridal shower. ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/98220011-9d2e-4a63-9ba7-1e77da4594f9~rs_768.h-cr_225.0.2000.1331)

If you're going for a coastal theme or the party's taking place at a waterfront venue, lobster rolls are a no-brainer. They're always a winner with guests.

### 8\. Scones 




![Scones at bridal shower](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/5221402c-1266-49aa-b0ef-edec7e870189~rs_768.h-cr_0.60.896.1255)

A classic staple at any breakfast or brunch, scones are a great addition to your wedding shower menu. To complement this baked good, set up a fresh fruit station and [mimosa bar at your shower](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-shower-mimosa-bar) for the ultimate morning-to-midday feast. 

### 9\. Dessert and Wine Pairings

![Dessert and wine pairing idea for bridal shower. ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/69b9b0e4-28d5-4b4e-a4a1-ed7cbd4052a2~rs_768.h-cr_0.223.1333.2000)

_Photo: Sarah Ingram Photography_




If the bride-to-be is an oenophile, stimulate their senses by arranging dessert and wine pairings based on their favorite blends. "Create a tasting station where each dessert is paired with a sample of one of their favorite wines," suggests Erin Emmett, founder and pastry chef of [Pistachio Culinary Studio](https://www.pistachiostudionyc.com/). "You might pair something sparkling with a strawberry basil macaron, riesling with a peach and almond tartlet pinot with a dark chocolate truffle." The expert also recommends pairing Bourbon with a bite-sized bread pudding. To give this bridal shower food idea a localized spin, source the wines and spirits from a regional vineyard or distillery and tap a nearby dessert shop for the bite-sized treats.

### 10\. Crab Cakes 




![Mini crab cakes at bridal shower](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/9e9acfb8-6b8c-4259-b582-2e6e5e029345~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1183.887)

For a bride or couple who loves seafood, offer crab cakes with multiple tasty dipping sauces at the shower. Roasted in-season vegetables and zesty salads are a must as sides. 

## Bridal Shower Food Ideas on a Budget

Hosts with modest bridal shower food budgets need ideas too. Below are dishes that won't break the bank, but will pack a flavorful punch. (Need more affordable suggestions for the event? Check out these [bridal shower ideas on a budget](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-shower-ideas-on-a-budget).)

### 11\. Caprese Skewers




![Caprese skewers at bridal shower](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/fa17908b-24bb-40e8-a98c-afaf8ff853c1~rs_768.h-cr_0.30.896.1225)

_[Photo: Vanessa Joy Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/vanessa-joy-photography-leander-tx-436991)_

Give guests a familiar taste of Italy with caprese. Put small amounts of mozzarella, tomatoes and basil on skewers or provide loved ones with plated portions. 

### 12\. Fruit Station




![Fruit station at bridal shower](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/c3c90af2-cc4d-48ef-8c65-c7b6bc6c483c~rs_768.h-cr_0.111.1333.1888)

_Photo: Fleckography Co._

No matter the time of day, a fruit station is always a much-needed addition to any bridal shower food table display. Fruit adds color to the table and is a simple way to provide a break from an abundance of savory and salty dishes. 

### 13\. Grilled Cheese With Tomato Soup




![Grilled cheese and tomato soup at bridal shower](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/1d955494-d03f-459a-ba6f-eb6ead82de4c~rs_768.h-cr_0.30.896.1225)

Want cozy food ideas for a bridal shower? Serve grilled cheese and tomato soup for your fall or winter celebration. Consider putting this classic pairing into bite-sized and shooter helpings or prepare it as the main entree. 

### Find your kind of venue

From barns to ballrooms, discover reception venues that feel like you.

### 14\. Personal Pizzas




![Pizza at bridal shower](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/b336479d-8d93-4961-8656-5b85debf5ff0~rs_768.h-cr_0.30.896.1225)

_[Photo: Casey Hendrickson Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/casey-hendrickson-photography-concord-nc-584601)_

Skip the traditional pizza party in favor of personalized flatbreads for guests to enjoy. While you can stick with the basics, like margherita or pepperoni flatbreads, consider experimenting with unique toppings too, like goat cheese and peaches or aged cheddar, pancetta and apple slices.

### 15\. Fruit Parfaits

![Fruit and yogurt parfaits at a bridal shower. ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/a5f7c682-0b83-4d97-aac4-80d1c63aebd8~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1777.1333)

_Photo: Jennifer Weems Photography_




Your party will no doubt include a [bridal shower cake](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-shower-cakes), cupcakes or cookies, but fruit and yogurt parfaits are another option for your dessert spread. You can prep them ahead of time or provide the ingredients for guests to make their own at a brunch time party.

### 16\. French Fry Bar




![Passed French fry appetizers](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/3ad6aaff-afd2-4022-99e6-e6af80f4a7a7~rs_768.h-cr_0.30.896.1225)

French fries will always be a favorite at any party, so you need to let this side dish make an appearance on your menu. To jazz up this simple starch, we suggest having a french fry bar with a variety of dipping sauces and toppings, such as honey mustard and parmesan cheese. 

### 17\. Fast Food




![McDonald's burger and fries at bridal shower](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/67cc675e-21c5-49aa-9418-cb8e8ec95432~rs_768.h-cr_0.30.896.1225)

_[Photo: Nikki Daskalakis](https://nikkidaskalakis.com/),__[Catering: McDonald's](https://www.mcdonalds.com/)_

Your bridal shower food doesn't have to be traditional. If the couple has a favorite fast food restaurant, hire them to cater a spread for the prewedding celebration. Not only is this easier for you, utilizing their favorite restaurant will make the event feel much more personalized.

### 18\. Fresh Guacamole Station




![Fresh guacamole station at catering](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/7f2821af-a511-46f0-86f2-26da849470f4~rs_768.h-cr_0.45.1080.1485)

Planning a Mexican feast for the bride or to-be-weds? Then, don't go the conventional route with your guacamole. Instead, have your caterer prepare fresh guacamole in front of guests for a bit of flair. 

## Creative Bridal Shower Food Ideas

When you want to impress the honored guest(s) and the partygoers, creative food for a bridal shower will catch their attention in the best way. Feel free to steal one or more of the ideas below or combine them for a fusion menu. 

### 19\. Sushi Bar

_[Photo: Casey Fatchett Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/casey-fatchett-photography-new-york-city-ny-610430)_

If you know the bride or couple loves sushi, you have to include it on your menu. Have multiple prepared options for everyone to choose from or hire a sushi chef to create these popular bites in person for an interactive touch. 

### 20\. Bacon Breadsticks

![Cups of soup with bacon-wrapped breadsticks. ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/1f46d986-16d6-4c50-b037-7a58dc57da64~rs_768.h-cr_169.0.1946.1333)

_[Photo: Studio Finch Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/studio-finch-photography-chicago-il-496480)_




This three-in-one appetizer combines a variety of flavors. Top single servings of tomato soup with bacon-wrapped breadsticks that guests can dip and munch on. Also, don't forget those who don't eat meat. Wrap cheese around the breadsticks for your vegetarian guests. 

### 21\. Bao 




![Bao buns at bridal shower](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/6b06547e-5d8e-4f56-be4d-603aaaa16daa~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1820.1365)

Steamed dough filled with a tasty filling, bao is a light and fluffy Chinese dish. The filling options are endless and we've seen people add crispy pork, tofu, chicken, duck and much more into this small, but delectable bun.

### 22\. Salmon Bites 

![Smoked salmon bite at a bridal shower. ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/93a9b21f-f722-45e5-9a4e-29f407927042~rs_768.h-cr_0.167.1080.1607)

Salmon bites are one of our favorite wedding shower menu ideas for those looking for light summertime food. Pair smoked salmon slices (or prosciutto, if you're avoiding seafood) with mozzarella cheese and multigrain crackers. Garnish with fresh chives or arugula.

### 23\. Dim Sum




![Dim sum at bridal shower](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/3040e849-1b41-4730-9a07-b56fa82698e3~rs_768.h-cr_0.28.1080.1468)

_Photo: May Iosotaluno Photography_

Give your guests multiple delicious things to try by having dim sum carts at the affair. This popular assortment of seafood, meat and vegetables is perfect for those honoring their Chinese background or those who love Chinese cuisine. Since dim sum is traditionally served with a range of teas, don't forget to add that to your [bridal shower drink](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-shower-drinks) shopping list. 

### 24\. Caviar and Potato Chips




![Caviar and potato chips at bridal shower](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/417dc2ea-55c2-4293-b0aa-dbfb5bc3cfb8~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1600.2133)

If you have room to splurge for the bridal shower, we recommend serving caviar and chips. Even though potato chips are a common household snack, people say this pairing still screams luxury and tastes perfect together.

### 25\. Lamb Meatballs

Lamb meatballs with black garlic rosemary yogurt sounds like a delight, but you don't have to choose this option. You can also have Italian beef meatballs with rustic tomato sauce and parmesan cheese or chicken meatballs with ricotta cheese and broccolini. 

### 26\. Seafood Boil

![Seafood boil at bridal shower](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/26097705-1546-4efb-97f1-8acef9eda0ce~rs_768.h-cr_120.0.1560.1080)

_[Photo: NylonSaddle Photgraphy](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/nylonsaddle-photgraphy-minneapolis-mn-560738),__Food: Tara Thai_




Whether you're from the South, Maryland or New England, a seafood boil is a welcome sight at any event. This option is perfect for a casual affair since this meal can get messy (in a good way)—that means you'll need plenty of napkins and wet wipes. Speaking of napkins, you should head over to The Knot Invitations for this purchase. There, you can not only create [wedding shower invitations](https://www.theknot.com/paper/invitations/bridal-shower), but also [custom napkins](https://www.theknot.com/paper/ceremony-reception/napkins) for your event.

## Simple Bridal Shower Food Ideas

If you prefer to stick to the basics, there's nothing wrong with that. Refer to these easy bridal shower food ideas, including tried-and-true favorites like finger sandwiches and soft pretzels.

### 27\. Tuna Ceviche




![Tuna ceviche at bridal shower](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/568d3638-c4fc-4fbe-9eb3-0a9cb38735ef~rs_768.h-cr_0.30.896.1225)

_[Photo: Alicia Ann Photographers](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/alicia-ann-photographers-middletown-ct-429945)_

An outdoor celebration (especially in the midst of summer) should include fresh food inspired by the best ingredients of the season. "Now that many people are entertaining outdoors, the focus is on daytime gathering, which makes the fare lighter and brighter," says Roberts. "Opt for simple and recognizable foods, but extremely well-sourced and curated ingredients—tuna ceviche comes to mind," he says.

### 28\. Preportioned Salads




![Preportioned salads at bridal shower](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/ae4c721f-3c0f-4f14-8e26-cf5e6b6681a2~rs_768.h-cr_0.113.1331.1888)

Keep the line for food moving by setting out preportioned salads on your party buffet table. Putting the salad in bowls or nice cocktail glasses will add a decorative touch, and you can create a separate station for dressings and toppings nearby.

### 29\. Finger Sandwiches

Finger sandwiches are one of the top no-fail snacks for a bridal shower. Layers of cream cheese and cucumbers make for a nice, delicate sandwich, though you could opt for heartier pinwheels with ham or turkey and cheese to give your crew plenty of options.

### 30\. Gazpacho

You can't go wrong with a tasty gazpacho, depending on the party season. Serve the preportioned bowls along with salad, bread and sandwiches.

### 31\. Esquites

Street food remains a fan favorite among foodies so why not have it at the bridal shower? Esquites, an off-the-cob version of elote, is charred corn topped with Mexican crema, cilantro, mayonnaise, lime, ancho chile powder and cotijia cheese. This dish offers sweet, tangy and spicy flavors that are perfect for parties happening during the warmer months. 

### 32\. Soft Pretzels 

![Soft pretzel bar with dipping sauces. ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/fa69f1ac-5c04-4364-acad-f582ccba5af0~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1000.1333)

_[Photo: Koman Photography and Cinematography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/koman-photography-and-cinematography-los-angeles-ca-830019)_




It's a known fact that soft pretzels are universally loved. For shower hosts that are looking to serve numerous snacks and easy-to-eat party food, you can't go wrong with soft pretzels. Dipping sauces like queso and mustard will keep your guests happy. Take it up a notch by hanging your snacks from an interactive display.

### 33\. Sliders

Simple wedding shower food ideas don't mean boring. Sliders are one of the best ways to have multiple options for every palette in the form of small grab-and-go bites. Ensure you have plenty of tasty meat and vegetarian sliders so guests feel satisfied.

Balance sweet and salty flavors with this comfort food dish that always hits the spot. It's a sweet and savory bridal shower food idea that'll create an inviting and homey atmosphere.

### 35\. Afternoon Tea Party

Your bridal shower theme can offer plenty of inspiration for the food you serve. If you're throwing a garden-inspired or [_Bridgerton_ -themed bridal shower](https://www.theknot.com/content/tea-party-bridal-shower-theme), for example, a tea party menu is a must. "The overall nature of _Bridgerton_ is hyper romantic, and people want to capture that elegance and refinement," says Roberts. "This menu would include delicate bites like tea sandwiches, miniature scones and cakes with bright, whimsical colors," he says.

### 36\. Popcorn Bar

Give your party guests some wedding shower snacks in between [bridal shower games](https://www.theknot.com/content/a-complete-guide-to-bridal-shower-games) and the bride or couple opening gifts. A self-serve popcorn station is extra tempting when you add paper bags or cones, along with various toppings like chocolate syrup or ranch seasoning. 

### 37\. Tacos and Tequila

![Mini tacos paired with tequila shots. ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/5d317ebb-0036-4000-a097-7d3fd40fa041~rs_768.h-cr_0.132.1333.1909)

If the honored guest(s) is up for serving margaritas at the bridal shower, pair the drinks with tacos for the perfect festive combo. A few alternative pairings you could try: beer and pretzels, sweet tea and fries or wine and risotto balls.

### 38\. Chocolate-Dipped Doughnuts




![Miniature doughnuts at bridal shower](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/0503cbbc-1ee8-439a-b5ce-dc2ae2458cf9~rs_768.h-cr_0.60.896.1255)

_[Photo: Amy & Stuart](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/amy-and-stuart-studio-city-ca-214738)_

We love how doughnuts were served in crystal glasses at this event. Consider copying this idea exactly or placing the chocolate-dipped doughnuts in antique bowls. 

### 39\. Pancake and Fruit Skewers




![Pancake and fruit skewers at bridal shower](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/9438580f-077f-44d8-bd6c-08236343f56b~rs_768.h-cr_0.30.896.1225)

Quick breakfast bites are always a crowd pleaser. Serve mini pancakes or waffles on skewers with fruit or sausage and have maple syrup on the side for guests to pour on their plates.

### 40\. Cotton Candy Station




![Cotton candy wall at bridal shower](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/8ea83d31-ee6f-48cd-a3a1-2e865b1ab823~rs_768.h-cr_0.30.896.1225)

_[Photo: Cassi Claire Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/cassi-claire-photography-bridgewater-nj-536108)_

Cotton candy isn't only for youngsters. Provide this sweet treat for all ages with prepackaged helpings or by hiring a catering company that has a cotton candy machine so they can make it in front of you. 

### 41\. Miniature Cinnamon Rolls

![Delicious brunch buffet idea for a bridal shower. ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/bf7b9eec-b816-478f-ae49-ae2209d93648~rs_768.h-cr_0.180.1080.1620)

You've probably heard of cake pops, but what about cinnamon rolls on a stick? We suggest offering this sugary pastry with chocolate sauce, caramel drizzle and cream cheese frosting as toppings. 

## Tips on What to Serve at a Wedding Shower

Figuring out what to serve at a bridal shower might seem like it takes a lot of preparation, but it's easier than you think. Follow these tips to narrow down your menu.

### You Don't Have to Serve a Sit-Down Meal

Traditionally, [bridal shower food etiquette](https://www.theknot.com/content/who-pays-for-the-bridal-shower-meal) doesn't require a formal, sit-down meal. Not only would this be a lofty expense for the host, which is [who pays for the bridal shower](https://www.theknot.com/content/who-pays-for-the-bridal-shower), it's not always necessary given the style of the event. Since bridal showers often occur in the late morning or early afternoon, spreads of appetizers, hors d'oeuvres and finger foods usually suffice. Even if you're having a wedding shower, which doesn't typically happen at a particular time of day, you don't have to go the plated route. 

### Consider the Bride's or Couple's Menu Preferences

Before you make the final arrangements, we recommend looping the bride or couple in to review the menu. This helps you avoid any mishaps, like adding something the bride or couple doesn't like or serving food that could cause an allergic reaction for a relative.

### Base the Menu on the Party Location, Theme and Time

As the host, what you serve is up to your discretion, but the menu should generally make sense with the rest of the party details. A wedding shower at a venue (which you can find on [The Knot Vendor Marketplace](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/rehearsal-dinners-bridal-showers)) might call for a more buttoned-up menu (think crudites and salad), while a backyard barbecue gives you more wiggle room for foods like fried chicken or cornbread.

The time of day when the party takes place will also affect your menu. For morning and midday parties, lighter fare, brunch foods and coffee are all appropriate. In the late afternoon or evening, you can serve more substantial foods and cocktails (if that's your style). 

### Ask Friends and Family to Help Out

Hosting a bridal shower is usually a team effort between the maid of honor and a few of the bride's close relatives. If you feel comfortable enough, ask some of the guests to bring dishes or desserts for a potluck-style party.

## How to Find Bridal Shower Catering

When in doubt, hire a professional. If you're not a whiz in the kitchen, there's no reason to stress about the food for the bridal shower. Reach out to local catering companies and private chefs to see if they'd be able to provide food within your budget. (We have thousands of vendors on [The Knot Vendor Marketplace](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/catering)). You can also consider professional catering from a nearby restaurant, especially if there's one you know the bride or couple loves. And don't forget to have prepared [questions to ask a potential caterer](https://www.theknot.com/content/questions-to-ask-your-wedding-caterer) so you know they're the right fit for your event.
