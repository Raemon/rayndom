## How to Use The Knot Registry Store as a Guest

We know how important it is to find the perfect wedding present. But when you open up a browser to shop for a gift, you might feel at a loss, especially with so many recommendations out there. That's why we always recommend consulting the couple's registry—just use the [wedding registry finder](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-to-find-a-couples-wedding-web-page) to look up the couple if their registry info isn't yet listed on their wedding website. 

How does The Knot Registry work? Start by determining a comfortable [amount to spend on wedding gifts](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-much-to-spend-on-wedding-gifts), then browse the couple's registry for [wedding gift ideas](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-gift-ideas) in your price range and follow the steps to purchase the item as you would normally do while online shopping.

If there are no more gift options available on the couple's registry (or none in your price range), we have plenty of curated lists to help you select an item they'll love. Get the inside scoop by knowing how to navigate The Knot Registry Store. Browse winners of The Knot Registry Award first, which are vetted by editors and real couples. Or check out niche curated collections, like Most-Wanted Gifts or Budget-Friendly Gifts. Once you find a gift you like, click Add to Cart and check out as you would at any online retailer. Then send the happy couple some sweet [wedding wishes](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-wishes-what-to-write-in-a-wedding-card). 

One of the biggest perks of shopping through The Knot Registry Store is that we make it super easy to track your purchases and have them delivered directly to the couple, which will come in handy especially if you can't accept your invitation (it's good [etiquette for gift giving if you can't attend](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-gift-if-not-attending) to send a gift to the pair's residence). Though, there is an option to send the package to your home if you prefer to flex your gift-wrapping prowess. Plus, if you opt for a gift card, experience or cash fund donation (if the couple is [asking for money as a gift](https://www.theknot.com/content/asking-for-money-wedding-gifts)) your gift is delivered immediately. (Read: No worrying about tracking the shipment or wrapping the gift the night before the nuptials.) Regardless of what option is right for you, we're here to help you find a great present in your price range that the to-be-weds will love.

## The Knot Registry Reviews

Looking for The Knot wedding registry reviews? We've compiled a handful to show you what couples and guests love. It's an easy wedding registry to navigate, a free wedding registry and, in our humble opinion, one of the best websites for a wedding registry all around. But you don't have to take our word for it. See why The Knot wedding registries are elite from people that have actually used them below.

### Easy Cash Fund Integration

 _The Knot has an option to set up a cash fund. This is a great option for your guests. The Knot does NOT keep any of the funds gifted to you. There is a processing fee. It's very small and, if your guests don't want to pay for it, they can just give you cash or a check. The fund is linked directly to our joint savings account._

### Easy to Link Outside Registries

 _I used The Knot completely for everything. It was really easy to link my registry and have RSVPs through them._

### Great to Relay Info to Guests

 _I'm using The Knot for their wedding website, registry and guest list. My wedding is in Puerto Rico, so it's really good for providing all sorts of travel info and FAQs._

### User Friendly

 _I mainly used The Knot for its gift registry, which is super convenient and easy to use. It checks off gifts that are already purchased._

### Helpful and Fun

 _Having multiple registries and online RSVPs and making your own site has been helpful and fun! They let you connect multiple registries to their site and their own registry, plus you can make your own cash funds, etc._
