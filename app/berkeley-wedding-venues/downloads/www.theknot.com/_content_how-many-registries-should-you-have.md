Let's face it: Making [your wedding registry](https://www.theknot.com/registry) is one of the best parts of getting married (besides spending the rest of your life with your soulmate, obvi). After all, preselecting your own gifts has its advantages. But how many places should you register for your wedding—and is one wedding registry enough? We're here to clear the air around this question so you can spend less time wondering about [wedding registry etiquette](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-registry-etiquette) and more time actually choosing the items you want. Keep reading to find out how many places you should register for a wedding and a few [registry tips](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-registry-26-top-tips) to help you keep everything organized.

## How Many Places Should You Register for a Wedding?

Depending on how many guests you're inviting, the formality of your wedding and the types of items you're registering for, you should create a wedding registry at three to five different places. 

[READ MORE Register for Coffee Makers, Cash & More on The Knot ](https://www.theknot.com/registry)

When it was the norm to go to retail stores and manually add gifts to your registry using a scanner, it was common to [register at two or three places](https://www.theknot.com/content/complete-registry-store-guide) (with five stores generally being the maximum). Today, it's still important to register at multiple stores—even if you do it online—in order to give your guests plenty of gifting options. A good rule of thumb when determining how many places you should register for your wedding is the 2:1 ratio, or adding two items for every guest, keeping in mind that not all of the items will be purchased. For a large wedding (150 guests or more), this might mean you need to register at three or four different stores in order to provide enough items at varying price points. For smaller weddings (less than 100 guests), you can pare down your registry to two or three stores, but make sure you're still providing enough options for all budgets.

On top of registering for household items, it's increasingly common for couples to register for experiential gifts. If you've already been living together before your wedding (or you simply don't need physical gifts), it might feel unnecessary to create a traditional registry. Instead, [cash wedding registries](https://www.theknot.com/content/cash-registry-the-newlywed-fund) and [honeymoon funds](https://www.theknot.com/content/best-honeymoon-registries) are unique ways to approach the gift selection process. Not only do these options make wedding registries feel more personalized, they also ensure that you'll get the most use out of your wedding gifts. While some guests may opt to give you cold hard cash or write a check the old-fashioned way, it's a good idea to create at least one alternative registry just in case. 

## How Many Registries Is Too Many?

It's okay to create registries at four or five stores, but anything more than that is generally pushing the limits. No one will think you're greedy for making a wedding registry at multiple stores, but it creates an overwhelming experience for guests (and you) when there's a long list of stores under the registry section of [your wedding website](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-to-let-guests-know-where-you-registered). While you definitely should have more registry items than guests, it's important to be intentional about what you're selecting. You can always add more gifts to your registry as items get purchased or sell out.

## Should You Have More Than One Registry?

It's important to register at multiple stores, but you shouldn't have more than one [universal wedding registry](https://www.theknot.com/content/the-knot-universal-registry) (a registry that consolidates all of the separate retailers in one place). A universal registry makes the experience more straightforward for your guests, but more importantly, it's easier for you to keep track of all the retailers when they're consolidated into a streamlined list. 

[The Knot Registry](https://www.theknot.com/registry) does exactly that—you can combine all of your separate registries into one easy-to-access list. With a universal registry, guests don't have to toggle between different websites to keep track of all the stores, and you don't have to worry about managing multiple URLs or logins. Instead, simply add your wedding website link to your [wedding invitations](https://www.theknot.com/paper). From there, your guests will be able to access all of your registry picks together on The Knot, even if the items are from different retailers. (ICYMI, Target, Anthropologie and Pottery Barn are just some of the stores you can add to your wedding registry on The Knot.) Plus, your guests can purchase items directly through [The Knot Registry Store](https://www.theknot.com/content/the-knot-registry-placing-an-order) without even having to go to the retailer's website. A final bonus: You can use The Knot Registry to set up a cash fund or link a honeymoon fund alongside your monogrammed towels and china sets. 

## How Big Should My Registry Be?

There's no exact answer to [how big your registry should be](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-many-gifts-to-register-for), but double the number of guests is a good starting point. Most importantly, you should offer plenty of [wedding registry ideas](https://www.theknot.com/content/best-wedding-registry-ideas) at high and low price points, because everyone is shopping on a different budget and with different priorities in mind. Some guests, like dear Aunt Ada, may want to splurge on traditional gifts (ahem, those delicate crystal candlesticks you'll only bring out for holidays and special occasions). Other guests might prefer to give you something more practical or experiential, like putting money toward surfing lessons for your honeymoon. Include a mix of must-have [wedding registry essentials](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-registry-checklist-essentials) and nice-to-haves, like a portable pizza oven, to make sure that all the bases are covered.
