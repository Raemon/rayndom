## Important Questions from The Knot

### Best advice for to-be-weds?

Try not to worry about things outside your control. While you might hope for a perfect sunny day that makes everything shine, remember it's all about celebrating life and love.

### What's your all-time favorite wedding song?

I absolutely love "Harvest Moon" by Neil Young. Romantic and timeless, it's a great first dance pick.

### Dream celebrity wedding guest?

Brandon Flowers, without a doubt. I've been a massive fan of The Killers since my early teens, so I'd be thrilled if he showed up to sing for me.

### Best wedding after party snack?

For me, there's nothing better than salt and vinegar chips with a cup of tea.
