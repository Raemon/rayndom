They brought a dance-friendly, joyous energy that made the evening feel both elegant and lively, and so many of our guests commented on how much they loved the music, both during and after the celebration. During cocktail hour, the band helped create a separate area with a jazz quartet playing on a small stage, which added a beautiful touch to the atmosphere.

They also offered us their MC services, DJ'd playlists when the band wasn't performing, and a mic setup to use for our ceremony. They were even able to play a song as a waltz last-minute for the father-daughter dance. And, most importantly, they sounded amazing when they played. We will absolutely be looking them up in the future for other events where we need a classy-as-heck band.

he kindest responses. Jesse met with me and my fiancé via zoom to ease my nerves about booking a band I’d never met for a destination wedding. He was so knowledgeable and put my mind at ease. I knew after the first meeting we would be well taken care of at our wedding. Due to difficulties during the planning process, we ended up expanding our original contract with them to include a cocktail hour and our ceremony. The grace with which they handled the situation was beyond impressive. The music they played was second to none! I sent over a “vibe/mood” for each event and they nailed it!!! For our first dance they played our special request song “my best friend” originally by Tim McGraw. For being a swing band, they could have fooled me to thinking they went country! FANTASTIC! In addition to all this, the timing for our wedding got to be a little behind (due to how much fun we were having) and the Klipptones gracefully rolled with the punches. They were able to pivot and change on a time to make our day perfect. The biggest heartfelt thank you from these newlyweds to y’all!

Josh and The Klipptones provided music, entertainment and MCing at my daughter's wedding on 5/14/22 at Jefferson Street Mansion in Benicia CA. They were fantastic, A+++ and 100% in...

every way. From their super-tight, funky music (they're also an excellent jazz ensemble) to Josh's skillful but unobtrusive MC and announcing stylings, they basically made the party. They know and can play all the music, from rock to pop to super funk to strings music for the processional (and excellent jazz). They cheerfully accommodate last minute changes from the bride and groom and their email communication is instantaneous and responsive. Their cost was extremely reasonable. Many guests excitedly asked us how we found them. Just look for their videos on YouTube and you'll see exactly what we mean. I literally can't say enough good things about them. They simply made the wedding.

Their sound is so smooth, their performance was so fun, and they brought an element and energy to the party that a DJ or any average wedding band simply cannot! If you they are the first band you came across, stop your search and book them. If you are on the fence, fall to the Kilpptones' side of the yard. You will not regret it!

One special treat was a surprise to my dad and Josh made sure it happened during the father daughter dance. The Klipptones are professional and play all ranges of music. The ceremony and cocktail music was beautiful and when it was time to dance, they got the dance floor going! Everyone danced the entire time and we continue to hear how much fun everyone had at the wedding and how much they loved the band we chose! I highly recommend The Klipptones for any event you're looking to have in the future! We cannot wait to continue seeing them around San Francisco and at future events!

including our own favorite songs or that people wouldn't dance as much if they couldn't sing along easily. The band let us pick two songs for them to learn - which was awesome! They also took our notes on favorite song lists so that we could set the tone. Overall - the band was a huge hit! Josh also did a great job as an MC (not too much, just helped introduce the speakers as they were needed, which is what we requested). During the band breaks, we got to play our own playlist which was nice as well. Overall - The Klipptones play amazing music and know how to keep a party moving, they give you choices and ways to involve yourself in the tone, and they were a TON of fun!

nightclub in S.F. They played all kinds of dancable mash-ups of modern songs that really impressed us. At our wedding, they performed our first dance song just the way we wanted so that we could dance our coreographed swing dance to it. But on top of that, I wrote an original song for my bride, taught the entire guest list the song, and surprised my bride with it. We sang it while the Klipptones were the music engine. It was amazing. They also had our guests dancing the entire time with songs and mashups that I picked from their incredible repertoire. They made our wedding reception a dream come true. They are truly outstanding musicians and Josh is a pleasure to work with. You can't get any better than this group. They are awesome! Thanks, Josh and the Klipptones!

I was never worried about anything related to the music and our guests enjoyed pre ceremony music, danced all night, and are still talking about how great the band was. We will be forever grateful that they learned three special songs for us, welcomed my dad to sing a song, and allowed our friend to plug in to play a song for our first dance. Above all else, they are fun to work with and a really really good band! I'm trying to think of another reason to have a party with a band so that we can do it all over again with them.
