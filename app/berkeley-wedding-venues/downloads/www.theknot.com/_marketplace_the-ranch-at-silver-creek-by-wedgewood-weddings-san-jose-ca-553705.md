d visited The Ranch, we knew this was the one. The entire staff was very warm and welcoming from the very beginning and they were in constant communication with us every step of the way. I never felt abandoned and my questions were always answered. I had full confidence and faith in them for my wedding day and they did an outstanding job. From setting up our decor exactly how I wanted it, to handling last minute seating chart requests, I felt supported the entire way. The was the best day of mine and my husbands lives and we are so so grateful for the entire team at The Ranch. A huge shoutout to Sarah, the one who gave us a tour of the venue and took care of us during our first meeting, our coordinator Teresa who was outstanding and very sweet, and our banquet captain Megan and trainee Tyler. Your wedding day is the one of the days, if not the only day, that you will remember for the rest of your life. We are sooooo lucky ours was one of those days you hear about in fairytales. I am tearing up right now as I write this! We are so grateful for The Ranch and how nice they were to us. There are no words to explain, we are forever grateful for The Ranch family!!!! :)) With eternal love -The Aldanas

We wanted an all inclusive venue that was going to take care of the burden of finding all of our vendors for us and honestly had a really easy time working with The Ranch! It was r...

eally simple to pick and choose what we wanted and didn’t want in our package. We never felt pressured to upsell or spend more or include something we didn’t want. The food was great, our guests were happy, our DJ was super fun, the flowers were beautiful, it was really all we could ask for. We ended up running late from our offsite ceremony and the team was super flexible with us, checking in to see how we would like to make shifts in our timeline for the evening. All in all a great experience.

ly mention our coordinator, Brittany. She was an amazing person who was always sweet and helpful, especially on our big day. Brittany made sure we stayed on schedule without feeling pressured to move from one part of the ceremony to the next. When it was time for her to hand off the reins to Jessica, our evening coordinator, the transition was seamless. Lana and I could not have been happier with the whole process. Despite a series of storms during the week, the weather cleared up beautifully with blue skies on our wedding day. We picked March hoping for the hills to be stunningly green. We were not disappointed! The panoramic view overlooking San Jose was breathtaking! It was like something straight out of a movie! Unfortunately, our photographer is still working on the photos, but as soon as we have them, we'll be glad to share them!

Strongly recommend against booking here. There was a short time span of 121 days between the down payment and the wedding. Wedding was cancelled half way through due to unforeseen ...

circumstances. Twenty thousand dollars is a lot of money to pocket. Denying us at least a partial refund is cut throat and predatory. There is not even a modicum of understanding or practicality in their business practices.

Wedgewood weddings does the bare minimum to help you out. On my wedding day they were doing a rehearsal and the people rehearsing brought dogs that went to the bathroom on the lawn...

and no one cleaned it up. They put out rows of chairs and there is no way it wasn't seen. They only allowed us to arrive 2 hours before the ceremony and nothing was set up and everything was rushed. Didn't give us enough time to take pictures beforehand. The photobooth they provided was horrible. Pictures were blurry, pixleated, and delayed. The venue was uncomfortably hot and no one would adjust the air conditioning. Food was just okay and they don't allow for proper tastings.

I apologize for your experience at our venue. We have had an issue with wildlife leaving d...

roppings on our ceremony site, so we did not purposely leave a mess from the rehearsal. Often it happens after we setup the ceremony chairs so we are working on a solution for this. It is our standard to only allow access to the venue 2 hours before the start time. Our staff is able to get the room ready to go in that time. I apologize for the photo booth and air conditioning. We appreciate your feedback so we can get these things fixed right away. We wish you all the best with your marriage!

I was so beyond excited to have our wedding at The Ranch at Silver Creek. We had booked the venue back in January 2021 and just had our wedding this past weekend on September 22, 2...

023\. Although the wedding was overall enjoyable and beautiful I am filled with the upmost disappointment and frustration at how poorly the service was and how my husband and I were treated the day before and the day of our wedding. A week prior to rehearsal we had our final appointment at the venue and gave our final guest count and made our final payment. My husband and I have always been on time with our payments and have every receipt printed for record. We were so excited that we were done with our payments and were looking forward to all of our family seeing the venue on the day of the rehearsal. On September 21, 2023 we had our rehearsal and at approximately 12:00pm that day I get a phone call from Erika Lucia from the sales office thinking that it was just a reminder for our appointment but she tells me there has been a mistake that occurred in the system. I ask her what the mistake was and she tells me that they had made a mistake on the final guest count and that we had a remaining balance. I continue to ask what did we owe the venue and Erika says, “You guys owe an additional $5,000.00.” At this moment I am already tearing up and starting to cry. I didn’t even know what to say but I ask, “how could this happen, I don’t understand.” Erika apologizes and says, “It did not update it in the system but we are going to need the payment, you can use multiple cards to make the payment.” They had informed me that the final guest count was off by 30 people and were still able to get everything that we needed on time for the event but still needed the payment in full. Throughout the entire time we had been with the venue and been with all the sales reps and even the manager all of them failed to catch the mistake and they decide to tell me the day of my rehearsal which is literally the day before my wedding. They weren’t off by 5 or 10 but 30 people with $5,000.00 not being accounted for. How could such a huge discrepancy gone unnoticed? After talking with Erika the day of rehearsal she tells us, “I’m sorry and it is definitely on us and is our mistake and we want to take accountability somehow. I will speak with my manager if we can set up a payment plan or discount.” The following evening the day before my wedding I get a call from the manager Amanda Mendoza saying, “I want to apologize for the miscommunication but everything has been ordered and set in place so we are still going to need the payment. You can split it onto multiple cards.” There was absolutely no miscommunication on my part. I was very communicative, I brought two of my wedding binders and even a poster board of the layout I made for the reception area with the names of guests and amount of people per table. There was not the slightest help of wanting to accommodate us with a payment plan or any discount. The manager Amanda said, “I can comp just you and your husband for a discount but cannot drag it out that long for a payment plan.” Even though this entire situation was their fault they did not want to help us out in any way, shape or form. When we get to the venue on the day of rehearsal it just gets worse. The grass is dead and patchy all over. I have been to the venue over 10 times and every time we had been there the grass was always green and crisp but this time it was dead and patchy all over. I was so excited for my family to finally see the altar and there is animal droppings absolutely everywhere. It was so disgusting and large. It was all over the grass and in the center of the walkway down the aisle. We did rehearsal and the entire walk down with large animal droppings in the walkway, absolutely unacceptable. I turn and ask Erika, “will the animal dropping be gone by tomorrow on the day of our wedding?” and she reassured us, “Yes it will be gone.” That was a complete lie the day of my wedding as we are taking family photos 45 minutes before the ceremony, my bridesmaids ask the janitor to please pick up the animal poop that was still all there. It doesn’t stop there my groomsmen notice before we took photos that there was broken glass at the altar and tell me before I went out to the aisle that they threw the glass over the hill so no one would get hurt or step on it during the pictures. We were allowed to be on site two hours before the ceremony and get there at 1:00pm the day of my wedding and as I go to my dressing room I notice that nothing is fully set up yet in the reception area and foyer. Everything I had brought was still being set up until the very last few minutes before the ceremony started. There was also a large pile of water in the cocktail area just right outside of the bridal dressing room. Anyone could have slipped and fell. As I get into the dressing room the first thing my bridesmaids and I notice is all the dirty couches and stains everywhere on them. Then I looked at my bouquet which was absolutely enormous. It was so big it was covering my face as I held it. My bridesmaids took scissors and were literally chopping it down to get it smaller just before the ceremony started. The lock on one of the doors to the dressing room was broken including the first two stalls of the women’s restroom as well. My bridesmaids had mentioned the coordinator Monica was rude and was unaware of the when to direct people down the aisle. Overall it was an awful experience to go through on the day before and day of our wedding. My husband and I were overwhelmed with stress and found it so hard to be happy on our special day when this situation was lingering in the back of our minds. On September 26, 2023 just a few days after our wedding my husband tells me he gets a call from the manager, Amanda Mendoza, at The Ranch at Silver Creek asking about the payment but he is at work and could not get to it. Then shortly around 4:00pm I get an email with a payment link that says, “Original message : Please pay the remaining amount due. If this is not taken care of our corporate office will be taking over the matter and sending it to collections. Thank you.” This entire experience has been an absolute nightmare. Think again before booking your wedding at The Ranch at Silver Creek.

For the price, this venue was fantastic. Our wedding was 3/26/23, and we really lucked out with the weather that weekend! The views were beautiful, and the venue was immaculate for...

our day. Wedgewood offers a bunch of preferred vendors for cakes, flowers, etc.; if you're willing to do the legwork, you can find others who are either better quality or less expensive, and the venue will work with them no problem. The only non-negotiable that I remember is that you have to use their catering. We will say: consider your entree selections carefully, as you don't get to taste everything (or even close to everything) at the tasting events they do (called "extravaganzas"). Our wedding coordinator, Lindsey, went absolutely above and beyond for us from beginning to end in our planning process. She was the one who signed us up, and she was there throughout most of the process (I think we had 1-2 meetings where she wasn't present that day, but we felt well taken care of otherwise). Whenever we contacted her, she was always incredibly helpful and never let us feel like our questions or emails were bothersome. She deftly managed our multiple vendors and family members (my mom and a friend did decorations, wife's sister managed desserts, we had a separate cake delivered, and we had an outside florist). We always felt heard, and she was great at communicating with us and brainstorming to make our day a success. There were even decorations where we weren't sure where to put them, and we gave Lindsey creative license, and she did a great job with them. We were so fortunate to have her as our coordinator! Also, on the day, our service captain (I forget his actual title), Kevin also did a fantastic job. We'd never met him before, but he brought us the snacks and drinks after the ceremony, and he managed bringing our food to our table, and making sure we had what we needed the rest of the night after Lindsey went home. He was a delight to work with and made sure everything was taken care of.

As a March 2023 bride and I cannot speak highly enough of my entire experience for The Ranch at Silver Creek. [ Planning Team ] Orlando, Katy, Lindsey & Sydney know how to get thi...

ngs done, and THEN SOME! * Orlando helped us get started with our vision with our initial meeting, when we ourselves barely had an idea of how we wanted our "big day" to look like. * Lindsey and Sydney answered all our burning questions (and we had MANY questions) in the last 2-3 months leading up to our wedding. * Katy was an absolute force to be reckoned with. I hope that she counts her "day of coordinator" days as a workout since she is literally running back and forth and making sure that the bride and groom are fed, taken care of, that all of our requests are being addressed, and that our guests are having a great time. * One of these fine folks improved my initial design of my wedding table and I was absolutely amazed and blown away. [ Venue ] * Very ADA accessible! No steep stairs to have to be mindful of * Beautiful landscape of the rolling hills because it was a former golf course * You get all the benefits of the large space of being a former golf course, without having disruptions by actual golfers and their golf carts * There is a Plan B if it is raining - and it doesn't cost extra if that is the plan that you have to take * The space is now made with hardwood, so it is very clean and elegant * The Bride's Room and Groom's Room are SO spacious and you can lock your belongings for yourself and your wedding party so they are safe during your wedding! * Also the fact that there is a Groom's Room in general is a MAJOR bonus, because many venues offer a tiny room for the groom, if there is even a room at all! * Only one major event can occur at this venue at one time -- other venues can have multiple events at once which was not something that we wanted for our wedding [ Staff ] * The bartenders do not mess around!!! Angela was so generous with serving our guests and she is quick and efficient, there was never a long queue at the bar! The Ranch's dedicated vendors will have their own individual reviews on their pages, but they also deserve a shout out here: * iMobile DJ - DJ Brian brought the energy up the whole night! * iMobile Photobooth - Tom was super sweet and captured so many funny moments * Flowers Diva - Shawna brought my vision to life and made it even better * I Do Wedding Cakes - Our guests thought that the cake was absolutely delicious [ Food ] * You know how wedding food is usually stereotyped to be blah and just okay? Well The Ranch kitchen shattered that stereotype. The cheese tortellini was so satisfying. Even the bread roll was warm and delicious. The roast beef was juicy and not dry. There was not a single dish that I could say that I was disappointed with! Overall, The Ranch team exceeded my expectations. I felt like my now-husband and I became good friends with the staff and they helped me have the most amazing wedding. Our guests could not stop raving about their experience. Everything was so organized and timely and I fully recommend everyone to book their wedding here ASAP because you really can't go wrong with this team, and your desired date may already be taken!

If you are looking for a gorgeous wedding venue in the South Bay that is affordable and has the best wedding planning services, this is it! My husband and I got married in October...

30th at The Ranch at Silver Creek and we were thrilled with our experience. The venue is managed by Wedgewood Weddings and they are a 5 star all-inclusive wedding planning business. I'm an event planner myself and I know how much effort it takes to plan an event, let alone a wedding. So I knew I'd need help and the Wedgewood team was with me every step of the way. What I like about them is they aren't just a day-of wedding service. Instead you'll have 1 main point of contact as well as a team of coordinators that work with you all the way through your wedding day. We had a 10 month engagement and I never felt nervous or frustrated when working with Wedgewood, which was a relief. Whenever I emailed or texted the team, I'd receive a quick reply and they'd have the best recommendations. Our main POC was Katy and we also worked closely with Lindsey. Both ladies were incredible! Wedgewood's wedding packages are also far superior to any other venues in the Bay Area. We booked the Elite package which included services like: florals, ceremony officiant, DJ & Photo Booth, food & bev, invitations, and wedding cake. You have the option to use your own venders for these services, you'll just have to make sure you hit your minimum. For me I LOVED the fact I didn't have to vet tons of vendors, because Wedgewood's vendors are high class and are very familiar with the venue. The only vendors I booked myself were photographer, videographer, hair & makeup artists and bus transportation. Wedgewood also gave me recommendations for these services and they have tons of discounts with companies that can enhance your wedding. I have so many good things to say about Wedgewood! Now about the venue. The Ranch is one of Wedgewood's newest venues which was ideal for us, since no one we knew was married there before. Also it used to be a golf course & country club, but now it is a solely a wedding venue, so you won't have any looky-loos. The venue is on top of a hill with beautiful city views and has a Mediterranean villa vibe. It's a true gem in San Jose. It's also very easy to get to and not far from downtown or SJC airport, which was important for us. There are two suites onsite for the bride & groom to get ready with their wedding parties which was helpful. We also liked how the venue had different areas to hold the ceremony, in case of weather issues. We were blessed with good weather on our wedding day, so we were able to have the ceremony outdoors, cocktail hour indoor & outdoor, and the reception was fully indoors. The Ranch also has a covered wrap around balcony so you and your guests will be protected and get amazing views of the scenery. Overall this was the perfect venue for us and we were so thrilled with the Wedgewood Weddings team, we wish we could do it all over again.

From beginning to the end, The Ranch staff helped us with every detail of our planning and made sure nothing was left untouched. Not only was the venue breathtaking, but the food was praised by all of our guests! If you’re struggling to decide between the potato options, choose the garlic mashed potatoes!! Every one of the staff poured out so much but Lindsey Lack, our day of coordinator, went above and beyond to take care of us on our wedding day. During our photo shoot she would bring us snacks and beverages to make sure we had something to eat and were hydrated throughout the night. She even made sure we had some time to just spend together away from the busyness of the crowd. She is incredibly intuitive and knows how to manage high stress situations with grace and laughter! THANK YOU RANCH STAFF!!!

nd relatively quick to respond over text. The team was also super flexible and let us make a lot of modifications especially around dietary restrictions. Pros: \- All inclusive means there is only one vendor to manage for everything. Makes it super simple to make sure everything will be taken care of. \- The subcontractors (DJ, Photo, Cake) were all wonderful and I would gladly recommend them \- Venue is stunning, and we felt we could go without a lot of aesthetic upgrades because of the venues natural beauty. We only did the upgraded reception chairs. \- All the staff were great. Katy made sure we were taken care of during the day, and Sydney made sure the night was super smooth. From the bartenders to the wait staff, great people all around. \- Price was not cheap, but also not crazy expensive. We felt we got what we paid for. Cons: \- If you want to customize every last detail and go off script, you will be paying a lot and loosing the advantage of all inclusive. You have to be ok with going with the house options, especially the food. It can all be tweaked, and they are super cool with outside vendors (for example we brought some extra food and a vendor for building a mandap) but I feel you should keep to the script! \- there were a few issues with the corporate Salesforce instance that caused us to go back and forth on contracts and invoices, which was annoying. The team always fixed it, but it was slightly annoying. Overall wonderful experience!

fessional, fun, and customer-service oriented Orlando(Wedding Coordinator), Trevor(DJ), Agnes(Bartender) and other amazing staff like, Amelia, Eugenia, Josh, Karla, Francisco and Chris were. We-and our guests had a blast thanks to our wedding crew. We had our ceremony at city hall and our reception at The Ranch which we started planning two months before our wedding. Orlando made the planning process stress-free and fun...The day of the wedding, Orlando was there for EVERYTHING necessary: he checked in on us consistently, whether we needed more drinks/food/etc., to remind us to take beautiful sunset photos, to make an impromptu bouquet when I realized I had forgotten mine and didn't have anything to throw during the bouquet toss..throughout the whole reception we felt so supported and accommodated. Our guests not only complimented our venue and its beautiful views, the appetizers, the drinks, the dinner, the late night snack tacos, the photo booth, but they also made it a point to say that every single person that was working during our reception carried themselves with such genuine friendliness and professionalism. I know that our wedding celebration would not have been as amazing as it was, if not for the Ranch and its partnering vendors. Thank you SO much--we will recommend you to everyone we know!!

s our wedding coordinator, and his efforts and attention to detail made everything perfect. Our wedding date was locked in 2 months before the actual date, and we were very rushed for time. Orlando guided us during each meeting- and reminded us of the small things that ultimately made our wedding memorable and beautiful. He was also accommodative of our requests. We had a big group come in for the rehearsal- Orlando handled the multiple opinions very tactfully and empowered us (the bride and groom) to finalize our vision for the big day. The venue was gorgeous and well equipped, but Orlando was the cherry on top of the cake for our wedding deal at Wedgewood/ranch at the silver creek. Also, special mention to the other team members who made our special including banquet captain Amelia, Francisco (chef), Nicky (server), and Agnes (bartender).

Amelia (the day of coordinator) was so sweet. She made sure that she had every single guests food restrictions were and made sure everything on the day of was on time and perfect. When our wedding day finally came, everyone was so amazed at how beautiful the venue was and how all the staff made sure everything was okay with each of my guests.

I cannot say ENOUGH about the Ranch Golf Club!! Literally, this was the absolute perfect wedding venue for our big day. We weren't sure about getting married on a "golf course", bu...

t honestly from the pictures I've seen of our day you cannot even tell. The beautiful original barn that is on the grounds is amazing. We were going for a rustic themed wedding and it matched our ideas perfectly. Speaking of perfect, the wedding coordinator Bonnie, is another huge plus to add to this venue. She is remarkable!!!! From day one of looking for venues and meeting her, we left their knowing that this was going to be our spot. Bonnie went above and beyond answering all of our million questions and responding to emails right away, even during the busy wedding seasons! We met with her multiple times, and she encouraged us to come check out other weddings that were set up so we could get a feel of how the barn looked all set up. The first one we checked out, we were in awe!! From that day we couldn't have been more excited to really start the planning process. Bonnie helped us every step of the way with helpful ideas and suggestions! During the Spring, the Ranch hosts a big tasting event filled with their preferred vendors and that's how we booked our photo booth as well as DJ, it was so helpful and not to mention, the food is DELICIOUS!! There are so many great choices to choose from and seasonal options it was tough to decide, but Bonnie let us come in for our own private tasting where we got to choose the choices we wanted to try to narrow down our decisions. Fast forward to the wedding, everything ran so smoothly and was flawless. I would not have changed one thing! The Ranch has its own bridal suite for the girls to get ready in as early as needed which was a big relief because our wedding party had 6 bridesmaids so we had ample time to get ready. I was so calm all morning and day leading up to the ceremony all thanks to Bonnie!!! She had everything running on time, and made sure we were all ready, and helped everyone be where they were supposed to during photos and during cocktail hour. She also coordinates with all of the vendors and is so organized! I could keep writing on and on about how fantastic Bonnie is and the Ranch because my husband and I are so extremely happy with how our day turned out. Our guests kept commenting on how beautiful the venue was and how great the food was. It is a homey feel when you are inside the barn and it's a very intimate & romantic setting. Once you meet Bonnie, you will love her sweet, funny, calming and enthusiastic personality which swayed our decision on the spot to choose this venue. The staff helps set up the tables and your decorations, and every worker that we met at The ranch is just fantastic and you can tell they really all love what they do in playing a role to make your wedding come to life! Thanks to Bonnie and all at The Ranch, our dream wedding came true and it would not have been so perfect if it were not for them! If you are looking for an affordable, rustic, barn wedding that will be amazing in every aspect, The Ranch Golf Club is your place and Bonnie is your go-to "Chaos Coordinator"!!

information I had previously provided each time had magically disappeared, we were not offered any discount or apologies for any of the countless hours and time we had to put into tracking down someone to talk to and help us each time.

This venue is by far gorgeous! The food provided was delicious! Here's where the venue went DOWN HILL for me: After the ceremony, I realized our gift card box was gone and was...

not in the foyer where it was originally placed. I figured the staff moved it, NOPE. Towards the end of our reception, I found some of our wedding card gifts on our sweetheart table which I thought was kind of odd but figured it was gifts given to us directly throughout the night. It wasn't until after the reception my husband, my family, my bridesmaids, and I all went looking for the box but it was NO WHERE to be found. I figured it was placed inside the wedding coordinator's office and figured I'd get it the next day. I returned the next day to pick up all our things and still could not find our wedding gift card box or any of the envelopes that were inside. I called the wedding coordinator who THEN informed me that she did see the wedding gift box go missing after the ceremony but did not tell anyone. She then guaranteed me that none of her staff moved it or touched it. I decided to go walk around the venue to see if maybe I could locate the box. In the foyer, I located our wedding gift card box on a random table, opened, with no envelopes inside. I called the wedding coordinator who then informed me she did not know anything about it and there was nothing they could do. A few days after our wedding, I was asked by our guests if we had received their gifts. I was COMPLETELY embarrassed to tell them their generous gift was STOLEN from our wedding venue and the venue informed me there was NOTHING they could do. They didn't even offer to look, or ask their staff because they GUARANTEED me their staff did not take it. I was EXTREMELY disappointed in the handling of this unfortunate event and the lack of professionalism demonstrated by the wedding coordinator.

d the wedding coordinators were not very good. The one I dealt with, Amanda, appeared like she was going to follow suit, but she was amazing. I think what it is, is that she is trying to focus on the bride's wedding coming up the soonest, so if she doesn't look like she cares or is taking notes, it is because you will have your turn and she will make what you want to happen, happen! Don't fret - give her time and she won't let you down.

It was the 4th person in this position since we decided (less than a year ago) to have our wedding here. She seemed like she did not know what was going on, had many of the details wrong and generally not really "with it". Fortunately everyone seemed to have a good time because of the venue and over look the staff. If you are set on having a wedding in San Jose at a beautiful venue, this is it. Be prepared to deal with an uncaring and unprofessional staff. Better yet...hire Twitterpated Weddings to coordinate and you will have nothing to worry about!!

not great coordination. We're glad we had our own personal coordinator that could work with them and keep them on top of it. First the things that went right: 1\. Pretty venue ...

2\. Jen's cakes were delicious! (their vendor and offers a complimentary cake) 3\. There was an Asian menu, which our families really enjoyed and good value for the almost all seafood menu. Examples of things The Ranch event team dropped: 1\. condiments/serving ware/chopsticks for an Asian meal \---&gt;my coordinator ended up transporting a bunch of it herself 2\. nearly didn't get linens Friday before wedding due to some miscommunication between their linen vendor \---&gt;my coordinator ordered from her normal vendor and had The Ranch comp it 3\. Their final payment bill to us was wrong 3x before they got it right (i.e. double-counting some of my vegetarians, forgetting they had agreed to adjust prices, etc). I literally paid them late Friday afternoon before our wedding. \---&gt;my coordinator kept checking and in close communication with them. Moderate rating as we had heard stories in general from other friends on their wedding day that coordinator is the best money spent. While disappointed with The Ranch itself, we still loved our wedding as our coordinator (Charmed Events in Santa Clara) did a great job of just handling things without me evening know. We learned of the issues afterwards.

s great food, and the views are to die for. But if you are looking for a place to get married that really takes care of you, unfortunately this isn't the place. There has been so much turnover at the ranch that we literally had to bring in our own people to help with the day of stuff such as arranging furniture, and pouring wine, etc. even though this was supposed to be included. Basically its a gorgeous spot, and if you are up to the task and doing EVERYTHING on your own (which we did) then totally go for it, but if you want more help from your venue than probably look elsewhere.

ood and drink and the cake is also included in the price. There is also an event planner. When we originally started the planning process, we had Chrissy. She was amazing and definitely knowledgeable. But midway through she quit. No one called to tell us and I had been emailing her with no response. Eventually I called to find out that she was gone and they were looking to replace her. Obviously I was irritated that I didn't know about it. About 5 weeks before my wedding they hired Whitney. When I met with her 2 weeks before, I was very impressed with how much she had learned in such a short period. She was able to answer all of my questions without hesitation. She made a few mistakes leading up to the wedding (wrong napkin fold, miscalculating the final balance) but they were quickly corrected. On the day of, I felt she could've done a better job in a few areas. When I was about to come down the stairs with my dad into the ceremony, there were people watching from the balcony and one of my guests actually came over to me to talk to me before I made my entrance! That should've been my special time with my dad. I didn't mind that they were up there (even though they weren't supposed to be), but she should have kept them away from me. I feel she should've been firmer with my guests about where they should and should not be. There were even a few people out in the courtyard when we were taking our family pictures when they should have been out on the balcony. Obviously those were just small annoyances, but there was so much that Whitney did right as well. It's a steep learning curve and if she was that good after just a few weeks, I'm sure she'll be amazing in no time. I highly recommend this place.

Manager KRISTY PARK. Don’t be fooled by the beauty of this facility; their business is a disaster. DO NOT BOOK THE RANCH FOR YOUR WEDDING. YOU WILL REGRET IT. -2 WEEKS BEFORE THE WEDDING, their event coordinator Chrissy Wolfman resigned, and we were later told that she had eft our event file largely incomplete, despite the fact that we had several meetings and countless email exchanges with her. -1 WEEK BEFORE THE WEDDING, coordinator #2 John Nguyen was assigned to our event, but he didn't have time to meet with us to finalize the details until 3 days before. At that time, we agreed on all event details and the final price. -1 DAY BEFORE THE WEDDING, coordinator #3 KRISTY PARK was assigned to our event. She wanted to undo the agreement we had already made with John (coordinator #2), saying he didn't have the authority to make pricing agreements with us. (Then why did he meet with us at all?) \- DAY OF THE WEDDING, KRISTY PARK told us - the bride and groom - as we were entering our own reception - that she undid our agreement with John (coordinator #2), increased the total cost, and needed our credit card to charge us the higher amount. Literally, as we exited the limo and were walking toward the reception entrance, my now-husband had to reach into his tuxedo pocket and pull-out his credit card from his wallet - just to make this nightmare go away. -DAY AFTER WEDDING, I called KRISTY PARK to express my dissatisfaction at errors the staff made at the event. She talked over me, cut me off, and was incredibly rude. In the 10 months I spent planning my wedding, I interviewed close to 30 vendors and hired nearly 20 -- and I had never dealt with anyone with no customer service skills and had zero interest in customer satisfaction. P.S. My wedding planner – who is a 5-star reviewed planner on Yelp – told me and The Ranch that she will not allow any future clients to book events there!

Ranch Golf Club for our ceremony and reception and it paid off on the day of our wedding. From daytime to evening it all looked so gorgeous! On top of that, the overall cost of their packages were well within our budget. In comparison to the many other venues we looked at, the Ranch offered a lot more for the amount you pay...good food and service, a delicious & beautiful cake w/ no cutting fee, modern looking decor, and last but not least Satra! Satra was the "icing on the cake" for us because she was such a helpful and responsive coordinator. I think much of the reason I was not stressed was because I knew my husband and I were in capable hands with her. She was quick to respond to my emails and changes, reassured me during the rehearsal and wedding when we were off schedule and was overall just a great person to work with. Thanks Satra & the Ranch Golf Club!
