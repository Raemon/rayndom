So, you've found your dream wedding dress—congratulations! But the fashion work is far from done: Now, it's time to select dresses for your wedding party that complement (and don't compete with) your gown. There's a lot to think about, and bridesmaid dress fabric is the first thing to consider—before even color or silhouette. 

"When beginning to engage a bride, the two questions we often ask to narrow down fabric choice are 'structured or more flowy?' and 'soft matte finish or a bit of shine?'" says Erin Wolf, [Bella Bridesmaids](https://bellabridesmaids.com/) franchisor. "Summarizing the core properties of fabrics in layman's terms helps to fast-track our understanding of the customer's vision so we can achieve the desired look." 

Even when broken down by those categories, there are a lot of fabrics to consider. So, we turned to Wolf and [Birdy Grey](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=9ibcrDa*U1o&mid=44848&u1=Theknot.com-bridesmaid-dress-fabric&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.birdygrey.com) founder Grace Lee to help us break down some of the most common fabrics used for [bridesmaid dresses](https://www.theknot.com/fashion/bridesmaid-dresses). **(Pro tip: Use code KNOTFRIENDS to get 10 free swatches for first time Birdy Grey customers.)** Keep reading to determine the best fit based on season, formality and more.

## What Is the Best Fabric for Bridesmaid Dresses?

There's no easy answer to this question, of course, as the best fabric for bridesmaid dresses depends on the venue and vibe of the wedding. There are trends, though, and fabrics that read more elevated than others. "We see bridal parties leaning into more structured fabrics for a clean, timeless look," Wolf says. "The weight and finish of structured fabrics give a tailored feel with no Spanx necessary!" (Note that while structured fabrics are generally the most flattering across body types, they often require more alterations than something flowy or stretchy.) 

Of course, seasonality is paramount when choosing types of fabric for bridesmaid dresses, too. Here, our experts offer their top recommendations by season. 

**Best bridesmaid dress fabric for summer:** In the warmer months, you'll want to consider the weight of the fabric, opting for lightweight materials to keep bridesmaids comfortable. Plus, summer weddings tend to be more ethereal, airy and romantic, so keep this vibe in mind. "For spring and summer, I always love chiffon or matte satin dresses," Lee suggests. "They're lightweight and move beautifully."

**Best bridesmaid dress fabric for fall:** "Fall gives space for a little more evening sophistication and drama," Wolf says. "We love a bit of shine at this time of year, and see mikado, satin twill and charmeuse lending polish to the wedding party look in any color."

**Best bridesmaid dress fabric for winter:** Lean into rich, weighty fabrics that might be too heavy or hot for warm-weather weddings—think velvet, jacquard or brocade in deep jewel tones. "For fall and winter, I lean toward velvet to add warmth and depth," Lee says. "Our brides have also been loving our super stretchy luxe knit fabric." 

**Best bridesmaid dress fabric for spring:** "Spring typically calls for more color in softer, romantic tones," Wolf says. "This lends itself well to more matte fabrics; we love faille, georgette or even some of the embellished fabrics and novelty dresses in lighter looks." 

## Bridesmaid Dress Fabric Types & What To Know

Selecting a bridesmaid dress material is no easy feat. Brides should consider their venue, wedding season, dress code or formality level and even their wedding party members' body types. Here, we break down 13 fabrications you might come across in your search, including what type of wedding and silhouette they work best for. (Note that if in-person [bridesmaid dress shopping](https://www.theknot.com/content/ultimate-bridesmaid-dress-guide) isn't in the cards, bridesmaid dress swatches are a great way to get a physical feel for the fabrics!)

**Jump to your favorite bridesmaid dress fabric:**Charmeuse | Chiffon | Crepe | Embellished Fabric | Faille | Georgette | Jacquard | Jersey | Mikado | Satin | Silk | Tulle | Velvet

### 1\. Charmeuse

![Charmeuse bridesmaid dress fabric](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/a7d44e9f-60c2-4d37-ae38-0b24ab1e3c31~rs_768.h-cr_0.139.592.928)

_Dress by After Six at Bella Bridesmaids_

**What to know:** "Charmeuse is a fluid, shiny fabric that's perfect for bringing understated elegance to a wedding party," Wolf says. It has a high-shine finish and matte back, and a particularly great drape ability. (You may also see it referred to as "satin charmeuse," as technically it is a type of satin.)

**Best for:** If you love the satin trend but want to elevate the look, opt for a charmeuse bridesmaid dress. It works especially well with full-length silhouettes that call for a little drape; think black-tie wedding. Plus, it will flatter your whole party. "Some [charmeuse fabrics] incorporate stretch for an easier drape and fit across more body types," Wolf says. 

### 2\. Chiffon

![Chiffon bridesmaid dress fabric](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/30d7c6fd-6763-41de-9848-fd4eb249bea1~rs_768.h-cr_0.107.1400.1974)

_Dress by Birdy Grey_

**What to know:** "Chiffon is lightweight and slightly sheer with a luxurious hand-feel," Lee says. "It's airy and diaphanous, plus it's easy to steam!" It's not a stretchy fabric, but it's flattering. "Chiffon is a classic for a reason. While the fabric doesn't have much give, most chiffon dress designs lean into the flowy aspect, so it's both flattering and comfortable."

**Best for:** A chiffon bridesmaid dress is ethereal, floaty and romantic, making it a perfect fit for events like springtime garden weddings. 

### 3\. Crepe 

![Crepe bridesmaid dress fabric](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/54e2562a-4bac-4ad9-a74b-05fb1adfe0b7~rs_768.h-cr_0.97.1366.1918)

_Dress by Birdy Grey_

**What to know:** "Crepe is stretchy—it boasts a four-way stretch—and curve-hugging with a slightly pebbled texture," Lee describes. "It's super comfortable and less prone to showing wrinkles."

**Best for:** Crepe bridesmaid dresses are universal: They're flattering and formal, while still being comfortable and versatile, and the fabric works well across seasons. For black-tie affairs, look for formal silhouettes and dress crepe up with gold or silver jewelry; for semi-formal, opt for something with a slit. 

### 4\. Embellished Fabric

![Embellished fabric bridesmaid dress](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/4d39b050-20fa-4724-9eab-f07080f0e28d~rs_768.h-cr_0.152.592.941)

_Dress by Dessy Collection at Bella Bridesmaids_

**What to know:** Embellished is a broad term: These are fabrications that are sequined, beaded, embroidered or otherwise textural and unique. "Novelty fabrics can take many forms—hand beading, embroidery or embossment, to name a few," Wolf says. (Lace might also fall into this embellished category, though it's rare to see a lace bridesmaid dress.)

**Best for:** Since embellished bridesmaid dress fabrics come in such a range of styles, they can be subtle or stand out. We love the latter for bold, artsy weddings—black-tie or otherwise. "Some brides really enjoy making a statement with the bridesmaids' fabric to set the decor tone for the event," Wolf says.

### 5\. Faille

![Faille bridesmaid dress fabric](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/cd7481ec-f165-40bb-a2d9-4550f924e433~rs_768.h-cr_0.58.683.969)

_Dress by Amsale at Bella Bridesmaids_

**What it is:** "Faille is a midweight ribbed fabric that has a refined, structured feel, making it an excellent selection for classic and clean-lined silhouettes," Wolf explains. A faille bridesmaid dress is notably wrinkle-resistant, making it a solid choice for a full day of wedding activities. 

**Best for:** The fabric works especially well for structural dresses and gowns. "It holds shape beautifully, making it ideal for A-lines, ballgowns or tailored looks with an architectural edge," Wolf says. 

### 6\. Georgette 

![Georgette bridesmaid dress fabric ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/eb6851d4-727b-4529-bc41-54c88b10a891~rs_768.h-cr_0.205.1500.2205)

_Dresses by Jenny Yoo_

**What it is:** Think of georgette as falling somewhere in between crepe and chiffon on the fabric spectrum: It's matte but ethereal, drapable but structured. "Georgette is a lightweight, matte, crepe-like fabric that allows for a soft drape on the silhouette without feeling as floaty as chiffon," Wolf says.

**Best for:** A georgette bridesmaid dress is beautiful for summer weddings, and works especially well on draped or bias-cut silhouettes. Note that georgette dresses often have some sort of knit lining due to the slightly sheer nature of the fabric.

### 7\. Jacquard or Brocade

![Floral jacquard bridesmaid dress fabric ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/7ed72075-182f-40b0-ba2e-be2cd8050250~rs_768.h-cr_0.90.1500.2090)

_Dress by Jenny Yoo at Bella Bridesmaids_

**What it is:** You may see the terms used interchangeably: Jacquard technically refers to the weaving technique, while brocade is a specific type of jacquard. "Brocade is a structured, luxe jacquard woven fabric, great for bringing textured elegance to a wedding party," Wolf says. 

**Best for:** A brocade bridesmaid dress is elevated and formal. Rich fabrications such as these work particularly well for fall and winter weddings. "Brocade is great for all body types, as the chic but weighty fabric allows for both ballgown and fit-and-flare shapes," Wolf adds. 

### 8\. Jersey or Knit 

![Jersey bridesmaid dress fabric](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/7ee5a30b-8844-4a16-8252-f6cfece32766~rs_768.h-cr_0.97.1366.1918)

_Dress by Birdy Grey_

**What it is:** "Jersey knit is incredibly stretchy and soft," Lee says. "It's really comfortable, but still sophisticated (or sexy!) enough for formal events." Worth noting? "It does tend to cling to your body, so we highly recommend pairing it with really great seamless underwear."

**Best for:** Jersey fabrics are perfect for bridesmaids who want to be comfortable! The fabric can read more casual than some others on this list, making it a good fit for semi-formal or formal dress codes, rather than black-tie. A jersey bridesmaid dress is often a convertible style, and "it's also great for maternity-friendly silhouettes because of the stretch factor," Lee notes. 

### 9\. Mikado

![Mikado bridesmaid dress fabric](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/74bf3563-1002-4900-a538-d765efd52b90~rs_768.h-cr_0.108.1280.1815)

_Dress by Bari Jay at Bella Bridesmaids_

**What it is:** Mikado is commonly used in wedding dresses, not just bridesmaid dresses; it's an elevated take on shaping, sculptural scuba. "Mikado has a lustrous finish that gives structure without stiffness," Wolf explains. 

**Best for:** For those considering [mismatched bridesmaid dresses](https://www.theknot.com/content/mismatched-bridesmaids-dress-tips) in terms of silhouette, a mikado bridesmaid dress is a great choice. The wedding party can opt for strapless, one-shoulder, halter, A-line or fit-and-flare styles while still looking cohesive in a sleek fabric. "The polished finish and sculptural silhouettes create a classic look while offering different shapes for different body types," Wolf says. 

### 10\. Satin

![Satin bridesmaid dress fabric](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/b41170c7-6574-41a5-81e8-e66e2b8d9b52~rs_768.h-cr_0.25.1140.1545)

_Dress by Azazie_

**What it is** : Satin has topped the list of [bridesmaid dress trends](https://www.theknot.com/content/new-bridesmaid-dress-trends) for a few years now, and for good reason: It's elegant, sleek and available in a range of fabric combinations that fall at a wide variety of price points (satin refers to a type of weave, rather than the material itself). "Satin is super smooth with a subtle sheen," Lee describes. 

**Best for:** "A satin bridesmaid dress is elegant and polished, making it perfect for more formal weddings," Lee says. "And it's really photogenic, too!" The fabric is often confused with silk, but it's considerably less expensive.

### 11\. Silk 

![Silk bridesmaid dress fabric](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/f9c07574-86dc-4480-99dc-32a0309b5e2d~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1000.1333)

_Dress by Reformation_

**What it is:** A silk bridesmaid dress is the epitome of luxe. "Silk is a natural fiber, versus satin, which is a type of weave," Lee clarifies. The material is smooth, soft, shiny and oh-so-sleek. "Silk has an elevated look and feel."

**Best for:** Whereas satin can read casual, formal, semi-formal or black-tie, silk is typically reserved for the most formal affairs. That said, its silhouettes are typically simpler. "Silk is beautiful but can be delicate, so it's ideal for sleek, minimal silhouettes," Lee says.

### 12\. Tulle or Net

![Tulle bridesmaid dress fabric](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/d8fce570-3698-4319-9af4-61a0edd36609~rs_768.h-cr_0.35.584.814)

_Dress by Revelry_

**What it is:** Tulle—also sometimes called bobbinet—is a fine net-like fabric that is transparent, lightweight and floaty. A tulle bridesmaid dress might have a knit lining or be made opaque with layers and layers of tulle, giving it a whimsical feel. (The term "mesh," which you may also see used, refers to an illusion inset rather than a full dress fabrication. "A skin-tone mesh inset is meant to give the illusion of a deep plunge while still holding everything together," Wolf says.) 

**Best for:** "Tulle is definitely making a comeback as a romantic and stylish alternative to chiffon," Wolf says. Think: Airy, ethereal weddings or outdoor affairs. 

### 13\. Velvet 

![Velvet bridesmaid dress fabric](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/5eb4baea-977e-45a7-889d-d6a522a65a50~rs_768.h-cr_0.103.1366.1924)

_Dress by Birdy Grey_

**What it is:** "Velvet is plush and smooth with a heavier weight and a good amount of stretch," Lee says. The fabric is textural and, though it's soft, can offer a touch of shine to photographs when it catches the light in the right way.

**Best for:** Velvet would feel out of place at spring or summer weddings, or destination affairs in warmer climes. Instead, it's ideal for fall or winter weddings, and especially stunning in rich jewel [bridesmaid dress colors](https://www.theknot.com/content/what-color-bridesmaid-dresses-should-you-have) like emerald green, sapphire blue or deep red. 

## Bridesmaid Dress Fabric FAQ

There's more to a bridesmaid dress—and the whole curated bridal party look—than fabric alone; there are costs and cohesion to consider, plus a few modifier terms to know. 

### Should bridesmaid dresses be the same fabric as the wedding dress?

While the dresses shouldn't match exactly (the bride should stand out, of course), the [wedding dress fabric](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-gown-fabric-glossary) can be used to guide the bridesmaids' looks. "The bride's gown is our North Star," Wolf says of working with bridal parties. "Its shape, texture and overall vibe guide us in choosing bridesmaid fabrics that complement her look, setting the perfect tone just moments before her walk down the aisle." Certainly, the formality of the bridesmaids' dresses should complement the bride's look and the overall dress code of the event. Lee adds that while there are no official rules here, it's all about balance. "If the bride is wearing a heavily detailed or textured gown, I like bridesmaids in something simpler and lighter," she notes. "If the bride is in something sleek and minimal, mixing in richer fabrics on the bridal party can add beautiful contrast."

### What does "stretch" fabric mean for a bridesmaid dress?

Some fabrics have a natural stretch to them; in others, you may see the "stretch" modifier—think stretch crepe, stretch knit or even stretch satin. That means the fabric has been woven with another fabric, such as spandex or elastane, to add an element of give. It generally makes the dresses more flattering for a variety of body types, so this is a good thing. 

### What does "luxe" mean for bridesmaid dress fabric?

Some [bridesmaid dress brands](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridesmaid-dresses-online) will use the term "luxe" to modify their fabric descriptions as well; Birdy Grey is one of them. "'Luxe' means we've elevated the fabric with extra softness, weight or sheen," Lee explains, "so it feels more refined, drapes beautifully and looks even more stunning in photos." Look for fabrications like luxe knit and luxe satin. 

### Are some bridesmaid dress fabrics more expensive than others?

While the fabrics themselves do have varying costs, the difference is nominal for the consumer. (One notable exception: pure silk will always have a higher price tag than satin, though the look can be similar). Instead, price is primarily determined by the amount of fabric used and the intricacy of the techniques used to craft the dress. "At Birdy Grey, we offer bridesmaid dresses starting at $89—but it's less about the fabric and more about the construction of the dress that separates an $89 dress from a $139 one," Lee says. 

Remember that in addition to the [bridesmaid dress cost](https://www.theknot.com/content/average-bridesmaid-dress-cost), you'll also need to consider [bridesmaid dress alterations](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridesmaid-dress-alterations). With almost all bridesmaid dresses, your party will need at least a hem, and some fabrics are more involved, and therefore more expensive, to alter (think: beaded dresses). Consider all costs that contribute to the final price. "When you want something more elevated as the bride, but your bridesmaids are on a budget, consider contributing to their purchase," Wolf suggests. "This gets you the look you desire without compromise, but also respects their pocketbooks."

### My fabric is partly polyester—is that okay? 

The actual breakdown of materials shown on the tag may differ slightly from the dress description. Notably, you may see Lycra in stretch materials or polyester in many satin styles. In fact, many satin dresses are fully or partly polyester (remember that satin is a type of weave, not a natural fiber); these tend to be less expensive. And it's not necessarily a bad thing, but be wary when ordering online. "Seeing and trying on fabrics and colors in real life is the best way to determine if the composition and color will meet your expectations on the big day and in photos for years to come," Wolf says.
