If you're planning on stepping out into the autumn foliage to pose for pictures with your soon-to-be spouse, you'll want your fall engagement picture outfits to complement your setting. Luckily, there's no shortage of options when it comes to fall fashion. From cozy knitwear to classic flannels, you truly can't go wrong. On top of that, you'll have the chance to accessorize with things like scarves, suede boots and felt hats. Ultimately, the decision of what to wear for fall engagement photos should come down to the location, weather and the overall vibe you're going for with your [engagement photos](https://www.theknot.com/content/engagement-photo-basics). To help you with your search for the perfect look, we rounded up plenty of fall engagement picture outfit ideas and inspiration based on the season's top [engagement photo trends](https://www.theknot.com/content/engagement-photo-trends).

## How to Choose Fall Engagement Picture Outfits

When coordinating fall outfits for engagement photos, layers will be your best friend. Weather is one of the most important factors to consider when deciding [what to wear for engagement photos](https://www.theknot.com/content/engagement-photo-outfits-what-to-wear), and it can be quite unpredictable this time of year. Your photoshoot day can start off warm and sunny but change to cloudy, windy or even rainy in a matter of minutes. Wearing an outfit with layers can help you be prepared for anything. Plus, it will allow you to seamlessly switch up your look between shots. "I always recommend dressing in light layers with some texture to the fabric," says wedding photographer [Ashley Gerrity](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/ashley-gerrity-photography-malvern-pa-553993). "Avoid busy patterns, blending in with the background and getting too 'matchy-matchy' with your fiancé. You want your looks to coordinate without looking too similar. And don't forget to accessorize—think of a playful scarf, bold earrings or a fun hat!"

Selecting your colors is another factor to consider while planning your engagement photo outfits for fall. As for the best colors for fall engagement outfits, the season is known for darker hues, deep jewel tones and wine-inspired shades. "If you're embracing the autumn ambiance, I'm a big fan of deep-hued burgundies and warm earth tones," adds Gerrity. But ultimately, the choice of what [fall colors](https://www.theknot.com/content/fall-wedding-colors) to wear is completely yours. "It really depends on your style and the vibe of your wedding," says wedding photographer [Hana Gonzalez](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/hana-gonzalez-photography-haymarket-va-1071132). "If you're looking for classic bright photos, you can choose lighter colors. If you're hoping for a modern darker look, you can go with deeper colors for more contrast."

While these tips can certainly help guide your fall engagement session outfit choice, [engagement photographers](https://www.theknot.com/content/engagement-photographer) stress the importance of selecting a look that you'll feel comfortable and at ease in. "One of the best ways to prepare for an engagement session is to treat it like a date night and have fun with it," suggests Gonzalez. "Picking a comfortable outfit and a familiar location will take the stress away, and couples can enjoy getting their pictures taken."

### Trendy Fall Outfits for Couples

If traditional fall engagement outfit ideas don't suit you and your partner's taste, you might prefer to wear something a bit trendier inspired by the internet's most viral aesthetics. Western attire and boho attire, for example, are two trendy styles that would work well for fall engagement photo outfits for couples. Whether you decide to don a dramatic lace gown or top your outfit off with a cowboy hat and boots, you're guaranteed to make a statement.

### Dressy Fall Engagement Shoot Outfits

Your engagement shoot is as good a reason as any to get all dressed up. After all, it's not every day you get your photo taken. Semi-formal attire can help make your photoshoot day feel extra special. The best part is that there are plenty of ways to add an autumnal touch to your look. For suits and dresses, opt for rich, warm hues, like burnt orange or maroon. Of course, black is another great choice no matter the season. Don't forget to accessorize with a seasonal-printed pocket square or bold jewelry.

### Casual Fall Engagement Photo Outfits

When it comes to your engagement photo shoot, you make the rules, and that might mean keeping things casual. After all, you want your photos to reflect who you are as a couple. Jeans and a flannel is a classic combo in our books, especially during the fall. To avoid clashing, however, we don't recommend wearing matching shirts with your partner. Instead, one of you can rock a flannel, while the other matches their outfit to the colors within the print.

### Classic Fall Engagement Photo Outfit Ideas

You truly can't go wrong with the classics, especially when it comes to photos you're going to cherish for years to come. For timeless elegance, opt for simple, understated outfits featuring elevated basics. A collared shirt and a pair of plaid pants, for instance, is one look that's guaranteed to stand the test of time. You can make it more seasonally appropriate by opting for knit fabrics and warm tones. Likewise, a streamlined satin skirt is always in style. Pair it with a flattering square-neck bodysuit and finish off your look with autumnal accessories like suede boots and an emerald necklace.
