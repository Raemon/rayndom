Such a unique property and collection. Definitely do a tour!! Our guide was super knowledgeable and added a ton of color to the experience. The setting is gorgeous and is beautifully framed by many of the "portal" pieces on the property.

This unique contemporary museum is located in Carneros, between Napa and Sonoma. Currently, they have a Cuban exhibit which according to the tour guide is rare, given the difficulty of obtaining Cuban artworks. As of now they only do guided tou...

rs which takes about an hour and a half. It’s privately owned and supported by an endowment fund. The facilities are nice and they have plans to open the place to events to generate income to keep the place going. Having a lake type body of water adds serenity to the museum. If you’re looking for something to see in Napa Valley, check this place out.

It's a small museum / museums cause there are two of them within a mile surrounded by scenic beauty and a picturesque lake. There are wineries surrounding the area, which makes it look even cooler. There is a shuttle service for free between th...

e two museums. The museums aren't great but it's not bad for one time visit. 20$ with the scenery doesn't seem like a bad package
