### Making a Change to Your Order

We understand that sometimes changes are necessary. If you need to make any changes to your existing order, call us right away at 

[877-843-5668 (877-THE-KNOT)](tel:877-843-5668)

. We print your order shortly after it's finalized and our team will advise you on the possibility of accommodating your change request.

Contact us within 14 days of delivery if you see any issues to arrange a reprint with the original shipping method. Discounts for reprints are offered if you find a typo that was approved during checkout or while working with a designer.

Color Accuracy

Keep in mind that as you design your stationery, the digital preview provides 80%-90% accuracy in representing colors. Some variation between the digital proof and the prints is expected.

If your printed cards don't match your sample or our color charts included with the sample packs, contact us for a complimentary reprint. And if you choose to reorder your cards in a different color, we're happy to offer you a discounted reprint.

Photo Quality

The quality of your prints depends greatly on the quality of the photo submitted. The personalization tool will alert you if your photo's resolution is less than the minimum requirement of 300 dpi. Contact us with any questions about how your photo will print.

Keep in mind the color accuracy as described in the section above. We're unable to issue reprints or refunds for orders containing alert-triggering, low-resolution photos.

### Reprints and Refunds

Our goal is to always deliver flawless and delightful prints. Because we custom print to order all of our stationery, returns are not accepted. We offer reprints in the rare event that a printing issue affected your order or if you need to make changes to your wedding plans.* We know life happens—we're here to help.

Need to request a reprint? Reach out to 

[help@theknot.com](mailto:help@theknot.com)

Provide your:
