Terri is the GOAT. She is the consummate professional. I will never forget our call on the day we postponed our wedding. The level of empathy she showed, the check in video, and th...

e swiftness in which she provided additional wedding dates was truly unmatched. Our photos are breathtaking and shall I dare say the best engagement and wedding photos I've ever seen. Terri goes above and beyond and for that I'm forever thankful. She is now our unofficial family photographer!

My husband and I LOVED Terri! From the small little details to the calm in the middle of the storm, she was amazing! My wedding AND engagement shoot had to be on the two hottest da...

ys of the year and yet she still managed to give us an amazing experience and product. Once you give her your vision, she is able to take it and run with it. Aside from her fabulous pictures, her calm yet professional demeanor makes you feel comfortable and at ease. I would recommend her to anyone!

We looooved working with Terri during our wedding. From our initial meeting with her (even with it being over skype), we knew instantly we wanted her to be our photographer. Not ...

only did her style of shooting fit with what we were looking for, but she has such a warm and inviting personality that we instantly connected with. Terri is very creative when it comes to different shots and locations. She even suggested a different location than we originally planned to take our pictures and it was much better than the original location. Her vision is unbelievable! What's even more impressive is she remembered EVERYONE'S names in a matter of seconds it seemed! We already saw some sneak peeks of our photos from the wedding and they are amazing!! We've received so many compliments. I could go on and on about how awesome Terri is, but I recommend you find out for yourselves. :)

Loved Terri! She made the entire day so much fun and she was charismatic and worked well with our group. At one point, someone asked if Terri was someone we already knew/ a friend ...

we hired for the wedding. Even though she wasn't, it definitely felt like she was! We received a sneak peek just two days after our wedding and already knew we would be counting the days until we could see the rest of them. When we got the rest of the photos, we were blown away again-now the hard part of picking which ones for our photo book! Terri did a great job of learning everyone's names and making sure we got photos of all those we loved. From the beginning when we had our initial phone call she was open and listened to us. Unfortunately, we did not do an engagement shoot since we live in NYC but we were confident that Terri would capture our wedding perfectly. Terri was communicative before the wedding and worked with us to make sure she knew what we wanted to capture and the vision we were going for. I recommend Terri without any hesitations and any bride/any one period would be lucky to have Terri document those special moments.

ling photos). We received a sneak peek of pictures the day after the wedding, so she is beyond timely. Everything during our experience went flawlessly, from engagement photos on. Everyone who sees our photos comments on the high quality, and we've recommended her to all of our engaged friends(even friends who aren't engaged want to work with her). We can't thank her enough for the beautiful memories she captured for us.
