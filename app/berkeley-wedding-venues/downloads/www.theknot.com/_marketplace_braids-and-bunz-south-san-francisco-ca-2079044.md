Ellyse is AMAZING! she is the one person that I knew I could trust to make me feel beautiful on my special day!! she did my sisters wedding, my cousins wedding, and it was only rig...

ht she did mine as well. she is always booked, so i was so happy that she ended up being free on my wedding day! she made me feel so comfortable and was able to replicate my inspo pictures perfectly. my hair felt so secure and my makeup stayed perfect even after crying throughout the day. I don’t always wear too much make up and she made sure that I still looked like myself and didn’t do more than what I was comfortable with. she was also just so kind and helped me be super relaxed while getting ready. i couldn’t have asked for a better HMUA!
