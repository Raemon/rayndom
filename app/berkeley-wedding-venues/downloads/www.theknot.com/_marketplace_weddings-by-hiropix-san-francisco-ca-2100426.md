4.5 stars!! We booked Kenny for both our engagement photos and our wedding, and he was fantastic! We loved his editing style, and he was incredibly easy to work with throughout the...

planning process. Being in the wedding industry, I’m very picky—but he truly delivered. We received so many beautiful images that we’ll cherish for a lifetime. Our venue had a few tricky lighting spots on the wedding day, and Kenny did his best to work around them. Some photos are still being finalized due to the unusual lighting, but he’s been transparent and honest about the process, which we really appreciate. Overall, we had a great experience working with Kenny. His in-person final gallery reveal was such a special touch and made us feel just as celebrated as we did on our wedding day. Thank you so so much for making our wedding day so memorable.
