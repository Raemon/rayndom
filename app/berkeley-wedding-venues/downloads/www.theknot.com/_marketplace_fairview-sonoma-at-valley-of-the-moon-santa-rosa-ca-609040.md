We hosted our daughter's wedding & reception at Fairview Sonoma Valley of the Moon Club & Golf Course on June 28, 2025 for 85 people. We purchased an all-inclusive package to help ...

us bring my daughter's wedding vision to life. The venue truly is ideal and comparably reasonable for people looking for a Wine Country venue that helps take away much of the stress of planning a wedding. With the exclusion of the photographer and officiant, the package we chose included: Invitations, Reception venue (with tables, chairs, tableware, dance floor, etc), Bar service, Catering, Basic florals (which we upgraded), Cake, Day-of Coordinator, and a cute Sparkler sendoff at the close of the night. We also chose to pay extra to host the ceremony at their pond-side Sugarloaf Course wedding site which offered a truly stunning, dramatic background of Hood Mountain in the distance, and bridal/groom suites to get ready in prior to ceremony. We chose a 5 p.m. ceremony, which had a perfect canopy of shade for a ceremony at that time, keeping everyone cooler on a hot June day. The overall vendors that VOM packages provide are STELLAR. The upgraded florals we chose (by Vanda Floral) were nothing short of SPECTACULAR and truly made the entire venue POP with color. DJ Steve (Wedding Belle Music) was on point, and super fun. The VOM in-house catering was delicious, and everyone loved it. We opted for a buffet style for more options. The Fleur de Lisa wedding cake was SO yummy and beautiful. We hired officiant Rose Barboza (recommended by VOM) for nuptials — she was great. We gave VOM our vision, and they truly listened. We provided all of our own table decor, and rented green water goblets from Encore – VOM was very accommodating with all of this. Highly recommend Fairview VOM if you are seeking an elegant SoCo venue that won't break the bank, and gives you lots of options to choose from!

We recently had our wedding at Fairview Valley of the Moon, and working with Vanessa was truly one of the best decisions we made in the entire planning process. From the very begin...

ning, she guided us through every step organizing timelines, helping us stay on track, and making the whole experience feel smooth and stress-free. Her kindness, patience, and clear communication made such a difference. We loved attending the food tastings and getting to choose our cake flavors and menu options everything was delicious and the process was so much fun. On the wedding day itself, everything was super organized. Our guests kept telling us how seamless and well-run the entire day felt. The atmosphere was perfect, the space fit our guests beautifully, and having the bridal suite made getting ready so easy and comfortable. They also offer several beautiful ceremony background options, and we chose the mountain-view space it was absolutely stunning. Vanessa was incredible on the wedding day walking us through the ceremony lineup, making sure everyone knew when to walk, and keeping the flow so natural. She was so sweet and truly made us feel cared for. One of the biggest highlights for us was how affordable the full package was compared to planning everything separately. Fairview includes so many important pieces that would’ve been stressful and expensive to manage on our own. We also took advantage of their recommended vendors Opal (photographer), Lisa (cake decorator), and Rose (officiant) and we are SO glad we did. Each one of them was amazing and absolutely worth it. Thank you, Fairview, for making our day so special. We honestly couldn’t imagine getting married anywhere else. We felt supported, relaxed, and able to just enjoy our celebration. We are super excited to see our photos and videos💛✨ Highly, highly recommend :)

I was the bride who held my wedding at this venue on **May 26, 2025**, and unfortunately, this company has shown me what true unprofessionalism looks like. Throughout the planni...

ng process, we had **four meetings** with the team. The first three went smoothly—our initial wedding planner was kind, attentive, and professional. However, at the **fourth meeting**, we were suddenly assigned **two new planners** without prior notice. The explanation given was that our original planner had abruptly left due to "personal reasons." The replacements were **completely unfamiliar with our event**, unprofessional, impatient, and even **shifted blame** when issues arose. 🙄 Due to budget constraints, I handled **all the décor myself** (including floral arrangements) and only asked for **early access** to the venue for setup. Yet, we couldn’t even reach the main planner until **the day before the wedding**—their excuse? A **local internet outage**. This is **not** a valid reason. If you know clients have an upcoming wedding with potential emergencies, it’s your responsibility to **provide a backup communication method** and keep them informed. On the **morning of the wedding**, we were told that **a new client tour** was happening, so our setup had to be delayed. As a result, we couldn’t start decorating the reception area until later, leaving everything rushed—many of my carefully prepared decorations **were never even used**! After the ceremony, while I was changing into my second outfit, the lead planner **repeatedly rushed me** in a **rude and impatient tone**, saying, *"Hurry up, the food is ready and will go bad!"* Excuse me? **I am the bride**—I deserve to look my best at all times! An **extra 10 minutes** wouldn’t have ruined the food, especially when the dining area was **only five minutes away**. Then, the **biggest disaster** struck: **the seating arrangement was completely wrong**. We had requested **10-person tables**, but they set up **6- and 8-person tables** instead. I had provided **detailed seating charts in advance** and even placed a copy at the venue, yet they **ignored it entirely**. Their excuse? *"Your chart looked like this."* Turns out, their printer was miss magenta color, so they **omitted all guests with colored name labels** without double-checking the digital file, the physical chart, or even confirming with us. Because of their **laziness and incompetence**, our guests had to **stand around waiting** while tables were rearranged—**far more time-consuming than my 10-minute outfit change!** The most infuriating part? Their constant rushing was clearly just so they could **leave early**. I get that May 26 was a holiday, but if you accept the job, you should **deliver proper service**. The **only silver lining** was the rest of the wedding package team—the **DJ, photographer, makeup artist, and restaurant staff** were all **wonderful, professional, and kind**. They were the ones who salvaged what your planners nearly ruined. Thank you to them for their warmth and hard work. 🥰 As for your planning team? Extremely unprofessional and seemed to rather be anywhere else other than helping with the wedding.

Response from Fairview Sonoma at Valley of the Moon on 07/23/2025

Hi Anthea, Thank you for your feedback. We’re truly sorry that parts of your experience d...

idn’t meet expectations. Your wedding day should feel effortless, and we regret that anything felt rushed or unclear. We strive to conduct three detailed planning meetings before each wedding to avoid surprises. That said, we acknowledge that things slipped through the cracks. For décor, we received a box of items without a layout, instructions, or even a quick sketch. When we asked for direction, the groom confirmed everything looked good in how we set everything up. We're sorry we didn’t have more to go on—we certainly tried our best. The seating chart was another area where confusion arose and we're sorry for not identifying the challenges even earlier than we did. We received multiple versions of the guest list, each with its own color system, which understandably led to complications. We flagged the inconsistencies with the groom the morning of the wedding and even in the moment worked hard to make it right. We know this can lead to confusion and frustration - for that we're sorry. We're actively improving our process to better manage unique formatting and unexpected changes after the final details meeting. While your contract allows access two hours before the event, we were happy to offer early entry to the ceremony site, suite, and reception space. A pre-scheduled tour did take place that morning, but was completed four hours before your timeline began. We’re sorry if that flexibility wasn’t experienced as helpful—our intent was to go above and beyond in accommodating your needs. Following your final detail meeting, we were unaware you were trying to reach us. Unfortunately, a local phone and internet outage affected the area. Once we received your email, we responded within five minutes via phone. Not ideal timing - we agree. The timeline for the day followed what was finalized during your 10-day planning meeting. We weren’t informed of a full hair and makeup change, which did delay the reception. Had we known, we absolutely would have adjusted the flow. You’re right—you deserve the time to feel your best. Last-minute timeline shifts are no problem at all when we’re kept in the loop about changes in the day’s rhythm. Although our coordination officially ends at the grand entrance, our team remained available to assist where possible throughout the evening. We’re sincerely sorry that our efforts didn’t come across the way we intended. It’s difficult to hear terms like “lazy” or “incompetent” when our team was doing their best with the communication and direction we had. We take your feedback seriously and to heart. We are glad to hear you had a positive experience with our vendor partners. They’re an essential part of the Fairview team and work hard to create memorable moments for every couple. We will be sure and pass along the review as well. While this wasn’t the review we dreamed of receiving, it’s heartfelt feedback like yours that fuels our mission to over-communicate, over-plan, and over-celebrate every love story that comes through our doors. Your voice helps us be better, bolder, and more intentional with every couple we serve. We genuinely wish you and Jessie a lifetime of joy, adventure, and unforgettable moments together.

absolutely wonderful and so helpful throughout the process. Choosing Valley of the Moon as our venue took 50% of the stress of planning a wedding off my shoulders. They include the DJ, florist, baker, catering, day of coordinator, lighting, tables, etc, etc. I could go on and on. And they give you suggestions for photographers, videographers, makeup artists, etc. So they also took the stress out of finding a trusted photographer/videographer who knows the venue and has worked with Lexy in the past. They think through every last detail with you. Every time I had a question come up or last minute needed to change something Lexy was very prompt, helpful, and accommodating. The service was 10/10. Not to mention the venue itself is gorgeous. It made for the most unforgettable wedding pictures that I am obsessed with. I highly recommend this venue to any bride and groom who wants a stressless, beautiful wedding.

Valley of the Moon also made a special exception for us to use pyrotechnics during our wedding which made our day absolutely perfect. Evelyn setup every detail of our wedding according to plan and for type A wedding planners like myself, Evelyn will go above and beyond to try and follow every detail to perfection. When our wedding was falling behind schedule, Evelyn did such an amazing job adjusting and suggesting how we can make up the time. She is very experienced and what she does, and was absolutely the BEST. We couldn't have had such a special day without her.

e perfect place. Not only was it a beautiful location, but also almost all of the vendors were in-house, making it so easy (for us) to coordinate. We hardly had to lift a finger, other than making decisions about what we wanted our day to look like. Our lovely coordinator, Evelyn, handled all the rest! Evelyn was excellent about communicating with us and ensuring we were happy with every detail (down to how we wanted our napkins folded -- a detail I had never even considered). On our wedding day, Evelyn and her counterpart, Lexi, made everything run incredibly smoothly -- there was literally not a single hiccup. We had 120 guests and they all raved about how our wedding was the most beautiful and fun, and best coordinated wedding they had ever been to! WOW! Not to mention, the food was incredible and the location was gorgeous, especially as the sun started to set. Weddings are almost always expensive, but this venue was worth every penny we spent. TLDR: Beautiful venue, great food, easiest planning experience as a bride. Highly recommend!

of the Moon was where I wanted to get married. Not only is the venue beautiful, but the price was by far the best I found in Sonoma County for everything that was included. Evelyn and Lexi made the planning process super easy and were always so accommodating and communicative! The actual wedding went as smooth as possible and all of my guests had a wonderful time. The venue DJ did an incredible job, the food was amazing, and the waitstaff were always attentive and organized. This venue went above and beyond my expectations and I truly cannot recommend it enough!

(Wow, it feels like just last week we were searching venues and fell in love with this one.) From beginning to end, we wholly felt that the details of our wedding were being well-...

thought-out and our opinions were the top priority. We worked primarily with Jordan, and she was very thorough about everything. I asked a million questions throughout the planning months, and she was very great about answering them and being patient every time I changed my mind about something (my now-husband let me make all the decisions). Even the day of the wedding, she made sure that nothing happened without my knowledge. Jordan made sure everyone knew where to be at all times. She helped with putting together all the little details that you wouldn't think of if you haven't planned/put together a wedding before. Through it all, she was very professional and respectful. The best part, though, was how practical and simple she made everything seem! She gave the options, we made the decisions, and we knew it would be done. The venue is BEAUTIFUL, and we chose the best day. The food, drinks, and desserts were DELICIOUS. We had the most fun at our wedding! (The only stressful thing about it was trying to get the families together for pictures.) And to top everything off... we planned the entire thing from the other side of the country! Imagine trusting your entire wedding to be done the way you want it without ever meeting the vendors in-person, or seeing the venue, or tasting the food. The fact that this whole thing came together so wonderfully by just trusting Jordan's expertise says a lot! I would definitely recommend Fairview Valley of the Moon to anyone hoping for a gorgeous, simple, and easy wedding!

Everything that is included in the package is of GREAT quality, and all of the vendors are very thorough in making sure they meet your dream day needs! While planning my wedding, I was told by various people that something would likely go wrong on my wedding day. However, I can say with 100% certainty that NOTHING went wrong on my wedding day, and that EVERYTHING was absolutely perfect, due to the hard work of Alex, Cassie, and Jordan. Highly recommend!

They offer several packages and the best package for us was so easy to choose as it had everything we needed without breaking our bank account. The venue was absolutely gorgeous with amazing mountain views and green. The decoration was spot on, the staff was friendly and professional. Cassie made sure everything was done as we had planned it and she went above and beyond to take us to the bridge that I had falling in love with from the pictures on the website. It happened to be farther away than I had expected. But she made it happen. I highly recommend using Cassie and Valley of the Moon.

The venue was completely renewed when we booked it! Fairview is a one-stop-shop that does it all for you! Victoria & Cassie made wedding planning not just stress free but also fun!...

The power duo took care of everything so I don't have to coordinate with vendors. They work with local florist & provides the wedding cake service; they provide tables & chairs & linens & center pieces & even table numbers. There is a wonderful selection of booze all night long that our guests have loved. Not to mention the crowd favorite: delicious hors d'oeuvre being passed around at cocktail hour. Finally, a buffet dinner with prime rib / chicken / salmon / veggies to cap the night off. They helped me make my dream come true and I can't say enough nice things about them. I've been raving about this venue to all my friends. The guests took amazing pictures at the venue because the back drop of Santa Rosa mountains are drop dead gorgeous. This is the place that I'll remember for years to come and might have to visit again for reunions / anniversaries haha! It's fair to say that the best choice I made in my wedding planning was to go with Fairview Valley of the Moon.

We got married at Oakmont 3 months ago on June 25, 2016. We cannot describe how happy we were with this venue! We toured Oakmont with Heather only a week after our engagement, and ...

knew right then that this was going to be our spot. The picturesque scenery of the grounds at Oakmont are just breathtaking. The outdoor patio with wine barrel fire pits and lights hanging above is what really sold us! Heather was nothing but friendly and professional from the first day we met her and I knew I would love working with her as our coordinator. Throughout our 8 month engagement, Heather was just an email or phone call away. She kept us on track and was so organized! From choosing small details to our menu tasting, everything was planned so well. The day of our wedding was flawless. I had two bridesmaids go early in the morning to decorate, and Heather and her staff helped with everything to make it just what we wanted. The organization of getting the guests and bridal party down to the ceremony site in golf carts was fabulous. Along with Heather, we had Vilte as our day of coordinator, who was also great. Vilte brought champagne and appetizers down to the bridal party during photos and made sure everything was running well. I could write a whole separate review about how well run the rest of the evening was, from the WONDERFUL buffet food, the friendly and efficient banquet staff, the breathtaking sunset....it was all so beautiful. We have received so many compliments about how organized and flawless our wedding day was. Our friends and relatives were impressed with everything and haven't stopped talking about it! We wish we could re-live the whole day again, because it was just that great. Everyone at Oakmont made our wedding just what we wanted. We highly recommend this venue to anyone and everyone and hope we get to go to another wedding there soon!

when we were first inquiring, to the day after the wedding, we never encountered a single staff member who didn't act in the most professional, and courteous manner. Heather, was the wedding coordinator we worked with and she has an amazing gift! Not only can you tell that she loves her job, but she can make any wedding dream a reality. No idea I had was too out of reach for her to do. When we met for our food tasting, she had set up a mock centerpiece idea for me (without me even asking) and it was exactly like the vision I had in my head! Oakmont takes care of all the catering and drinks which all our guests loved! Oakmont staff was very responsive during the wedding planning process. No matter how many frantic calls and emails I had Heather and her team always was calm and always had an answer or plan. They are also very flexible. Their package not only comes with food, drinks but also all linens, tables, and even some centerpiece items to use. Although if you want to bring in your own rentals they welcome that too! (unlike alot of venues) I could go on forever about this venue, but to put it simply Oakmont made our wedding day perfect!! We are so happy!

lly did go above and beyond to make our day nothing short of magical! I don't even know where to start....I suppose I should first mention the two amazing ladies that made all this possible: Heather and Jasmine. From our early emails and meetings, these two were just lovely. Personable, professional, fun and friendly, responsive, it was such a pleasure working with them. The entire staff was nothing short of perfect. I should mention that we did not have an outside wedding coordinator or planner, nor did we need one here at Oakmont. While they don't market themselves as wedding planners (or charge for it!), Heather and Jasmine were as helpful as any wedding planner could have been. We gave them an initial timeline, and they gave us tips and suggestions to make it all work smoothly. Jasmine had copies of our wedding schedule the morning of with vendor arrival times and such, and she and her team seemed to be everywhere at once making all the pieces come together seamlessly. The ceremony took place out by their little lake, and the reception space was just gorgeous. They provided chairs and an archway and beautiful oak barrels...we couldn't believe how much Oakmont provided at no additional cost. We could also not believe how affordable it was, especially considering the quality of the venue and the team! And the food was delicious! Both John and I haven't tasted better. We did buffet style and it worked wonderfully. We can't imagine a better venue and team than we found here at Oakmont Golf Club. A huge thank you to Heather, Jasmine, and the entire team!

n gave us her cell number if anything came up last minute and we needed to reach her. So much was included for the price and they were more than willing to accommodate any of our needs. The food was incredible, we had 150 guests and the dinner was plated, presentation was great and everybody loved it. One guest had a gluten allergy and they were very helpful making a specific dish just for her. We had a day of coordinator who had never been to the venue, nor had our photographer, and Heather set up a time that they could tour the venue and show them around. On the day of Heather was extremely helpful and the entire staff was so friendly and on top of everything. After the ceremony they bring down champagne and appetizers while the bridal party finishes taking pictures which is a really nice touch since most bridal parties miss cocktail hour completely. I cannot say enough good things about Oakmont and their staff, they made what most consider a very stressful day completely stress free and so much fun. With Sonoma County being wine country venues are extremely expensive and do not include much at all, Oakmont is very reasonably priced and you get so much for your money. Thank you so much for making our wedding day absolutely perfect and the best day of our lives!

assle it can be, but all of the venues we had looked at in Sonoma County were outrageous in price. My dad actually found Oakmont through an internet search. Heather toured us on the property and we fell in love immediately. The lake area where the ceremony is held is breathtaking and the reception area was just redone. We knew immediately that we would book. Throughout the planning process, Heather was absolutely spectacular; emails were answered within 24 hours and she has a wealth of knowledge. We did have some confusion the week of, as they had changed their contracts and we were on the old one. That got cleared up right away though. The rehearsal went very smoothly - so a big thank you to Jasmine! We were out of there within 30 minutes. The day of was awesome. All of our guests marveled at the beauty of the place and how no one knew it was there before. We actually had deer laying on the grounds during the ceremony (which I'm sure they can't promise ;) ) that made it absolutely magical. During pictures after the ceremony, they actually bring down champagne and other beverages, as well as appetizers so that you can enjoy what you chose and paid for. Dinner was amazing as well and the staff was superb and over the top with their customer service. Between Jasmine and the DJ, we stayed pretty much on time with our timeline through the night. We were a little flustered before cake cutting, as we had no idea what to do, but Jasmine stepped right in and helped us out. Overall, I would highly recommend Oakmont to any couples! My one other recommendation would be to book something offsite for getting ready. The room is windowless and does get very warm - especially with 6 girls in total. Other than that, I don't have any complaints and would certainly consider them for future events.

on. We only looked at three venues after we got engaged. As we drove up to the Oakmont and saw the view of the mountains, we were immediately sold. And after our first meeting with Heather Pelleriti (Director of Sales/Marketing and primary point of contact), it only solidified our decision further. Within minutes of meeting her, we knew we found someone we could put 100% trust in to make our vision come through. In our experience, the customer service we received at the Oakmont was my favorite part of working with them. Heather and her assistant Jasmine were responsive, attentive to detail, and truly invested in our reception. They had great suggestions when we were stuck, but also listened to our ideas. The reception itself went off seamlessly; I did not have to worry about the schedule or our guests needs! Many friends and family were raving about Heather, Jasmine and the rest of the awesome staff. Additionally, this venue provided everything we were looking for. The food was delicious - heart-shaped quesadillas, spanakopita and coconut shrimp for appetizers, and trip tip, chicken florentine or vegetarian wellington for dinner. We got so many compliments, which is huge considering the chef prepared ~150 perfectly cooked tri-tip dishes. Quite a feat! We had ~230 guests, but Heather and Jasmine helped us plan a layout that was spacious, and still accommodated a huge dance floor and photo booth. The patio provided a spacious area where guests could enjoy the views, and Heather helped us add wine barrels converted into fire pits and cute lights. Whether it was bringing us appetizers while we waited for our entrance into the reception, making sure we kept on schedule, or just being so kind and welcoming to our guests, we could not say more about this venue! Highly recommend it!

Our wedding day was hands down a dream come true and it wouldn't have been possible without the incredible Oakmont team. My husband and I were engaged for 23 months, and we met wit...

h Heather only 1 month after being engaged. Throughout the entire two years of working with Heather and her team in order to make our wedding day possible, every email or notification from them was pleasant, professional, and personal. She truly cared about us as a couple as well as the vision we had for our big day. In the days leading up to the wedding, the weather forecast was constantly changing. I was praying that it wouldn't rain, but knew that if it did, the Oakmont staff would still pull off a flawless event. As the weather was still questionable on the morning of the wedding, Heather and I discussed options should it begin to rain. Due to the questionable weather, the ceremony site was initially set up indoors. As I really wanted to get married outdoors (weather permitting, of course), Heather's staff set up the ceremony site for a second time that day down on the green. It couldn't have been an hour later when I was sitting in the bridal room getting my hair done, when it started to gush rain, with a mix of strong hail, thunder and lightening! Heather's crew went all the way down to the ceremony site IN THE STORM to pull all of the chairs, arch and décor in order to set up the ceremony site indoors for the THIRD TIME that day. The Oakmont staff was so extremely professional and kind throughout the entire process and never showed any signs of frustration even with the numerous ceremony site changes due to the weather. The final location for the ceremony was in fact inside, but the set up was so beautifully done, that we were still able to enjoy the incredible view...

My husband and I loved having our wedding at Oakmont, and definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a venue for their wedding day!!! What drew us to Oakmont was how it included...

so much. Oakmont provided the ceremony site, reception site, wedding coordinators, tables, chairs, dishware, etc. They will even do centerpieces for you, but do allow you to bring your own (which we did). I loved having my wedding on the golf course! The ceremony was gorgeous!! Oakmont provided an arbor and wine barrels for us to use during our ceremony. It was really nice to have a venue that provided so much so you can focus on other things A major thing that venue provided was a minimal need of decoration. Between the natural beauty of the golf course and the look of the deck, the only decorating we did was for the tables. I also loved that my guests were able to hang out on the deck. The dining room for the reception is very spacious; it was able to hold all my guests (approx. 150) and quite a bit more, a dance floor, photo booth area and have room to spare. The staff was very helpful the day of the event and leading up to the event. I emailed my questions to Heather and Zora and they replied very promptly. My photographer wanted to see the venue before the day of our wedding, and Heather was more than willing to show him around. The day of the event went very smoothly. My girls and I got there at 9am and were able to start hair and makeup right away in the bridal suite. Compared to other bridal suites I have been in, this one is a great size. The bathroom is right next to the bridal suite and we used it as another room to get ready. We had hair being done in the bridal suite and did the makeup in the bathroom. Also, the tables were all set up when we got there ready for us to place our centerpieces on them. One of the staff members saw me caring a box of ceremony stuff, and he told me that I am the bride and should not be lifting anything. If there is anything we need, we just had to ask.
