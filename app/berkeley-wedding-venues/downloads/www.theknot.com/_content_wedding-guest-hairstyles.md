When putting together an outfit for a wedding, one of the most commonly overlooked accessories is hair. _Okay_ , so wedding guest hairstyles aren't accessories, per se, but they do have the power to transform your look in the same way that a sparkly clutch or a piece of statement jewelry would.

But with countless options to choose from, how do you go about deciding which 'do is right for you? We chatted with Los Angeles hairstylist, [Waz Shaiwayana](https://www.instagram.com/itswaz/), to learn which looks guests have been loving this year.

## Updo for Wedding Guest Ideas

"For those wearing halter neck or open-back gowns, [wedding updos](https://www.theknot.com/content/updos-for-long-hair) for guests are the perfect choice," says Shaiwayana. These types of [formal hairstyles](https://www.theknot.com/content/formal-hairstyles) are able to complement your gown without distracting from its details. Another reason to consider hair-up styles for wedding guests? They're great for the reception and after-party. Seriously, who wants hair in their face while they're busting a move on the dance floor? "My absolute favorite updo hairstyle for a wedding guest is the messy updo inspired by Alix Earle," Shaiwayana adds. You can easily achieve this look by putting your hair up in a loose bun without brushing it out first. Then, pull two pieces from the front out of the bun and allow them to frame your face. The result is a sexy, lived-in [bun hairstyle](https://www.theknot.com/content/bun-hairstyles-for-wedding) that's sure to earn you plenty of compliments. Keep scrolling for more updos for wedding guests, including some [hairstyles with bangs](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-hairstyles-with-bangs).

## Half-Updo Wedding Guest Hairstyles

For all of us indecisive folks who can't decide between an updo or down, half-up, half-down wedding guest hairstyles offer the best of both worlds. According to Shaiwayana, adding a simple ponytail to the top of your straightened, curled or crimped hair for wedding guests can make all the difference. "It doesn't feel like you're doing much, but it easily elevates the look at the same time," she says. Want to elevate your look even further? Try braiding the two pieces of hair that frame your face and connect them at the back of your head using a claw clip or an embellished hair pin. The result is a simple-yet-elegant [half-up hairstyle](https://www.theknot.com/content/half-up-hairstyles-for-long-hair) for wedding guests that can be achieved in a matter of minutes.

## Wedding Guest Down Hairstyles

"I'm a hair-down enthusiast through and through," says Shaiwayana. There are few things more empowering than showing off your natural hair texture by wearing it down for a wedding. Simple wedding guest hairstyles that don't require excessive products or bobby pins are also great for guests who want to save time (and stress) while getting ready. Of course, you could enlist the help of a hot tool to take your look to the next level. Bouncy, voluminous blowouts, for instance, are all the rage for wedding guests this year, and they can be achieved by using a blow-dryer and a round brush. A straightener or [curling iron](https://www.theknot.com/content/creating-perfect-curls-for-your-wedding-hair) may also come in handy if you plan on wearing your hair down to a wedding. Below, we've rounded up a few examples of the many ways that you can wear your wedding guest hairstyles down.

## Advice for Easy Wedding Guest Hairstyles by Length

Depending on your [hair length](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-hair-type-tips), some wedding guest hairdos may be easier to achieve than others. For example, there are so many unique ways you can add braids to a bob, but styling it into a full updo may prove to be rather difficult. Below, we're sharing some tips to help choose the wedding guest hair that's right for you.

### Wedding Guest Hairstyles for Long Hair

Like we mentioned earlier, '90s-inspired blowouts have been one of the most popular wedding attendee hairstyles recently. While it's possible to achieve this look with shoulder or mid-length hair, it does tend to work best on longer locks. Some of our other favorite [long hairstyles for wedding](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-hairstyles-long-hair) guests include classic curled or straightened tresses. Pro tip: Curling irons with different barrel sizes will all create different [curly hairstyles](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-hairstyles-for-curly-hair). Use a wider barrel to create loose, natural-looking waves. Use a narrow one to create tighter coils.

### Wedding Guest Hairstyles for Medium-Length Hair

When it comes to wedding guest hairstyles for shoulder-length hair, or hair that extends slightly past the shoulders, the options are virtually endless. Most updos can be achieved with this hair length. Of course, there's a major benefit to wearing a down [hairstyle for medium-length hair](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-hairstyles-medium-hair): the styling time. It typically takes just minutes to run a hot tool through mid-length hair. No matter what style you choose, be sure to avoid using heavy products, like gels and pomades, which are known to weigh down medium-length hair. Instead, opt for a lightweight mousse or texture spray.

### Wedding Guest Hairstyles for Short Hair

We'll say it louder for the people in the back: Short hair is sexy. Whether you're rocking a chic pixie cut or a chin-length bob to an upcoming wedding, we're sure you'll make a statement. While an updo might not be in the cards, there are still plenty of gorgeous [short hairstyles for a wedding](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-hairstyles-short-hair) guest. We recommend wearing your hair down and using a bit of product to hold everything in place. Now, if you want to differentiate your 'do from your everyday hairstyle, opt for some accessories—never underestimate the power of a trendy headband or some sparkly hair pins.
