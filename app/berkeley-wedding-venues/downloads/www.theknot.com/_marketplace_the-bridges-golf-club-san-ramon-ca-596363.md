The Bridges Golf Club was an amazing venue and made the wedding planning process intuitive and straightforward. We had our wedding in September 2024. All of our guests commented on...

how beautiful the venue was along with how delicious all of the food was (we can't recommend enough the mini beef wellington Hors d'oeuvre). The Bridges actually has two venues on site. There is a smaller 100-120 person setting, which we used, and a larger 250-300 person setting. Both are great! We worked with Sharon for planning our wedding. Sharon was very responsive and helpful throughout the entire process (about 9 months of planning leading up to the wedding). She laid out the food/venue options very clearly, along with the payment schedule. For the rehearsal and the day of the wedding, we worked with Adriana as our coordinator. Adriana was always nearby making sure everything was going smoothly and starting on time. The Bridges was a great wedding venue and reasonably priced compared to many other similar venues that we toured around the same area.

coordinator needs to stay the entire night and not pass off the rest of the duties to someone we hadn’t spoken to. I think there were so many things that could’ve flown better and there was overall just a big lack of communication about the timeline, even though we laid it out. Other than that, venue and food were great.

My husband and I just had our wedding at The Bridges this past Memorial Day weekend and were SO happy with the turnout! We originally booked our wedding for 5/28/21 but postponed t...

o 5/28/22 because of COVID. We mainly worked with Sandy and she is super responsive and professional. I found The Bridges on "here comes the guide" when I was filtering for "all inclusive" wedding venues--meaning they come with food, drinks, tables, chairs, etc. That already made wedding planning so much easier for me. The Bridges was also one of the more affordable venues we visited, which I sooo appreciate. We hired a different day-of coordinator, so they actually ran our ceremony rehearsal, but Emma from the Bridges was super friendly and professional also. She drove us around on the golfcart for all of our pictures, which was so nice! About the venue itself--it is beautiful and doesn't need too many decorations! The ceremony site is already picture perfect with the rose bushes, and the reception room is huge, with tall ceilings and 3 iron chandeliers. We ended up using two of their preferred vendors: A Loves in Bloom (florals) & Fantasy Sound Events (chandelier & custom initial light)--we were so happy with both. They are preferred vendors for a reason! We also got SO many compliments on the cocktail hour food and dinner entrees. One person told me "best wedding food i've had"!! We had the prime rib and salmon as our entrees and both were excellent. Thank you to The Bridges, Sandy, Emma, + the whole special events team for making our day so perfect! I can honestly say nothing went wrong the whole day (or at least I don't know about it :D)!

Not only did we have incredible views of the golf course for photos, but the ball room inside was also stunning with beautiful chandeliers and wood accents. The Bridges team made everything so easy for us and I would 10/10 recommend this venue to our family and friends! Thank you for making our wedding weekend so special and stress free!!

Planning a wedding during the pandemic was a bit of a challenge but Sandy always answered all of my questions promptly. She is very professional and you can tell she has been doing this for a long time. I have never planned a big event so it was great having Sandy to help us. Our day of coordinator was Mercedes who was also great !!! She helped with the rehearsal and throughout our wedding day. We were able to enjoy our wedding day as she and the rest of the staff took care of everything. I would highly recommend The Bridges for your next event !

My husband and I had an intimate micro wedding at the Bridges Golf Club on 11/7/20 with 30 people. Sandy was our coordinator and Colby was our day-of event captain. They were both ...

great. Sandy tolerated my countless questions (and was very responsive) since the day we saw the venue late August 2020. Everything was initially planned outdoors (ceremony and reception) but when we saw potential colder weather/winds/rain in the forecast and it was getting darker earlier due to daylight savings, Sandy let us change our reception to the indoor clubhouse. I'm so glad we made this decision and that it was still available to us (while Contra Costa was still in the red tier). Colby was excellent during rehearsal and day-of and she chauffeured the bridal party in the limo golf cart to different locations for photography. She helped us make sure everything ran on time. We did run a couple grand over budget since we didn't realize there was a food / beverage minimum until reading the contract, but we were able to meet the minimum after buying a few bottles of wine to take home. I don't think our big day could have gone any better. I can’t wait to get our photos and video so that we can relive our special day! The venue really was lovely and it was a beautiful day to get married.

We got married on 9.18.2020 at The Bridges Golf Club and we seriously could not be happier with how it turned out! Quick background: We were originally supposed to have our recept...

ion in the Clubhouse/Fireside Room. About a month after the Covid-19 shelter in place orders, Sandy (Director of Catering Sales) contacted us and gave us a choice to postpone or move the reception to the Garden Pavilion (it had not been reserved yet) to allow for more social distancing. We chose to move to the Pavilion. As our date got closer, and indoor dining was not allowed, Sandy let us know if we were to continue with moving forward for 9.18, our reception would be outdoors and our guest count would go down to 30. We let her know that we wanted to wait to make the final decision of moving outdoors til September 1 (ideally hoping indoor dining would open back up) and she was ok with that. Through the whole process, questions, and concerns, Sandy was very helpful and responded quickly. We did end up having to cut our guest count (as indoor dining still had not opened) and were allowed 50 guests at ceremony and 30 at reception. Due to this cut, our total food & beverage minimum went down. It did however make the cost/person compared with the total food/beverage minimum more expensive, but due to the circumstances, we understood. We were able to add the amazing short ribs late night snack and our guests raved about it. Due to the reception being outdoors, we worked with A Grand Affair to have tables with umbrellas for our guests. For the rehearsal ceremony and day of coordinator, we worked with Colby and she was amazing! She helped with the timing of everything and was very flexible with our storage of decorations. We didn't feel worried about anything during the day! There was even a miscommunication with our 6 inch cake and sheet cake with the delivery and staff. She contacted our baker and figured out the details right away. Colby also drove us in the golf cart to our picture destinations before our ceremony and during twilight hour. We felt so taken care of with her! It definitely was not what we had pictured our wedding to be like when we first chose & started planning with Bridges, but how it ended up was absolutely perfect for us. We would highly recommend this venue for a wedding, whether it's indoor or outdoor!

(We had a lot of questions all the time.) Her response time to emails was great. Jaime did our food tasting and was super helpful in helping us pick what we wanted to serve. The day of the wedding he was amazing. He made sure that my husband got to try all the passed horderves because we were taking photos. Our day of event captain, (I forgot her name) was amazing.

4 stars for a wedding venue (downside is the homes in the background). 5 stars for the catering (loved Jaime!). 2 stars for the wedding/sales managers + less negotiable contract. ...

The Bridges is a pretty venue (minus the homes in the background) - the clubhouse & garden pavilion are gorgeous (if only the green window/door frames were a darker brown color instead). The head chef Jaime is GREAT & super accommodating/kind/humble - both during our tasting, and also even during the wedding. He was our favorite staff at the Bridges. However, we weren't the biggest fans of the wedding/catering sales managers Sandy/Celena. The positives were: responses were quick & detailed (they are professional and do follow through- so that's a "pro"). However, personality-wise, we would've preferred a warmer, more genuine personality. Out of all venues we toured, they were the least enthusiastic/helpful compared to all other venues' wedding staff.. and many things in their contract are non-negotiable (where other venues are WAY more flexible). I remember being initially sad choosing Bridges over some of the other venues primarily because I enjoyed corresponding with the other venue's staff so much more. Ultimately, things worked out. The venue is beautiful, food was good, guests were happy. Just don't expect warm fuzzy enthusiasm or a ton of flexibility in creating your dream wedding when working with them.

and the wedding ended up being a dream. Everything leading up to the wedding was really well-planned and Celena was in constant communication to make sure that we had everything taken care of leading up to our big day. We enjoyed the food tasting, and working out all of our details. We were very at ease knowing The Bridges had everything taken care of. On the day of our wedding, everything was great. Everything was set up to do a flip of the fireplace room since we had the ceremony and reception in the same room. Also, they left a plate of hors d’oeuvres and glasses of champagne in the bridal room for us to enjoy immediately after the ceremony before taking photos. They even put our gifts in a safe place during the reception and had all of our toasting flutes, cake knives, and personal things packed up and ready to go for us at the end of the night. It made the whole night effortless for us. We are so happy we had our wedding at The Bridges, and the day after wished we could have done it all over again the exact same as the day before since we had so much fun!

s have mentioned that they wish we could have heard their reactions as they walked up to the venue and had their breath taken away, but I was hiding in the bridal suite! We knew we wanted an outdoor ceremony and indoor reception in a venue that was beautiful enough without many decorations - and The Bridges provided that exact experience. In addition to the beauty, every staff member we worked with throughout the planning process and the day of were wonderful and great with communication. They were quick to respond and answer questions and made us feel supported and at ease. Special shoutout to our day of coordinator, Colby, who warned me about the chandelier before my bouquet toss and then promptly watched me throw it right into it! Still one of the moments I replay in my head and laugh over and over. I couldn't recommend The Bridges enough. We are still beaming with joy and can't wait to get our photos back so we can share the day for years to come!

My wife and I had our wedding at Bridges Golf Club a few weeks ago, and we could not be happier with how everything turned out! We are very happy that we chose Bridges for our wedd...

ing venue. To start with, Sandy and Celena were excellent sales people to work with. They did not try to sell us every available package, but rather they worked with us to make sure we got the wedding we wanted and were very accommodating. We emailed quite often with new questions and requests to change our order, and they were always very patient, responsive and helpful. Working with them was a very pleasant experience and made the wedding planning go much smoother. The venue itself is gorgeous. The ceremony location (the garden terrace) has a beautiful view and is very close to the clubhouse. The clubhouse itself does not require a lot of decoration, as the interior looks very nice on its own, and has great ambiance. We also enjoyed the accompanying areas, like the bar room and the balcony overlooking the golf course. The surrounding green also provides great locations for photos. Colby was our wedding day event coordinator, and she was fantastic! We met her at our ceremony rehearsal, and she was very helpful and patient to answer all of our questions about the big day. She walked us through the ceremony multiple times, and was happy to let us rehearse as many times as we needed. She was very kind and easy to work with, and was particularly good on the day of our wedding. She worked closely with our vendors to make sure our wedding timeline went as smoothly as possible. On our wedding day, she made sure to periodically check in on us to see if we were on schedule and comfortable. She even made sure we had some appetizers and champagne for ourselves before our grand entrance into the reception! The ceremony at Bridges went perfectly. We had no problems getting our own arch set up prior to the ceremony. Some of our vendors had also worked with Bridges before, which helped. Our guests really enjoyed the view and complimented us on a beautiful ceremony. The reception was so much fun! By the time we got the head table, there was champagne set out for us, and we were independently waited on by the serving staff (a nice touch). We chose to pay for the open bar, and our guests enjoyed having wine on the table and cocktails during dinner. When dinner was served, we received our food first, but we noticed that everyone received their food shortly thereafter. Everyone enjoyed their meals, as the prime rib and salmon were very tasty! The food actually exceeded my expectations, despite having gone to our free tasting. Everything following dinner, including the first dance, cake cutting, etc. went off without a hitch, and we credit the Bridges staff. Small touches, like making sure two new glasses of champagne were set out for us at the cake cutting table, made the experience so wonderful. We were even impressed with how the staff cleaned up by the end of the night, as they saved every last decoration item that we brought and returned them to us in baggies. Overall, we can’t say enough about how great the night was! We highly recommend Bridges Golf Club.

My husband and I are so happy that we chose The Bridges to host our ceremony and reception back in October. We were lucky to have beautiful weather on the day of our wedding, whic...

h meant that the ceremony was just stunning. When we were looking at different venues, we knew that we wanted to find somewhere that would be convenient for our guests coming in from out-of-town, let us host a late-night party, and provide as much as possible onsite and The Bridges nailed all of that. The venue is gorgeous and I love how our photos turned out, the staff (especially Celena) were wonderful to work with, the food was good and overall our experience was exactly what we were hoping for. In terms of value for money, The Bridges was by far one of the best in the Bay Area and I would highly recommend as a venue to anyone.

I am so happy I booked this venue. The entire staff was super helpful since the very beginning. Celena & Sandy were amazing to work with and they responded right away with whatever...

questions we had. On the day of the rehearsal I was introduced to Colby who would be our coordinator for the day and she was absolutely amazing. Our photographer failed to show up on time and my husband said Colby was calling all the photographer she knew since we were not sure if she would be showing up at all for our event. When our photographer did arrive, she took us away from our cocktail hour which is something we were supposed to have enjoyed had she been there on time, and Colby was nice enough to give us 15 extra minutes so that my husband and I could say our hello's and enjoy it with our family and friends. Silvia was also great making sure we were good with our food and were constantly refilled with our wine. Everyone was amazing and all I heard all night was how we had the best wedding ever and it had to do with entire staff at Bridges for making the wedding look flawless!

We had our wedding at The Bridges Golf Club this August 2018. Both my husband and I were so happy with how the day went and how much our guests enjoyed our wedding and the venue. ...

The venue is really beautiful! We had over 200 guests and Bridges was able to accommodate our wedding size and have everything run smoothly. We had less than 6 months to plan everything, but with Sandy and Celena’s help and recommendations, we were able to complete all the details easily. Many of our guests expressed how great the food was at the reception (prime rib and chicken), including the appetizers and wine that was served. The day of coordinator, Colby, was so great! She made sure we stayed on schedule and she worked well with our photographer and DJ. I am so happy we chose The Bridges Golf Club for our big day! All our guests had a great time and that was really important to us. It was truly beautiful, fun and stress free!

My husband and I got married at The Bridges Golf Club in July 2018. When we were inquiring back in September 2017, they only had two more Saturdays in the summer months still open!...

We luckily were able to snag one of the last ones, and we could very clearly tell why this is such a popular place. What really sold me on this venue is the reception area. Absolutely beautiful space! I really loved that there were many different spaces, like the infamous tunnel, where the photographer could get some cool shots. Sandy and Celena were very responsive during the whole process, responding to my (many) emails promptly and were very detail-oriented. They were so helpful with the planning process and made it very stress free. The day-of-coordinator, Colby, was amazing as well! She made sure that we stayed on schedule- and worked so nicely with my vendors. The event staff was all very friendly as well, with Jaime making sure that my husband and I were always well taken care of. Thank you Bridges staff for making my wedding my dream wedding!

We are starting to receive the photos from our photographer and let me say .. "WOW!" The venue and the grounds provided an excellent and magical backdrop to our photos. Looking back on our wedding almost 2 weeks ago, it is without saying that we would not have done anything different to our big day! Thank you for making our 10/6/17 wedding one for the books! We hope to make this special place our new little "date day" get away. In the future, we will definitely be reaching out to Sandy and her staff to book another sensational event!! If you want to have a fabulous and stress free wedding ... The Bridges Golf Club is your place!!

amily and me. They were both very responsive whenever I had questions or concerns and were always willing to work with me. Before we picked Bridges, I met with many other Bay Area venues but no venue came close to Bridges with regards to value for our money - you get SO MUCH when you choose Bridges (here's just a few): 1\. The venue is beautiful - diverse indoor and outdoor areas for photos, guest mingling and amazing views during the ceremony and reception. We had our ceremony outdoors, overlooking the canyon and our reception in the elegant Garden Pavilion. 2\. The staff is so friendly and helpful. Colby was our day-of-coordinator and she was great: easy to work with, strong knowledge of the venue, organized and kept us on track. Having a great team at the venue ended up being one of the most important pieces to planning our wedding and we are so, so grateful for this!! 3\. The food was AMAZING - our guests continue to comment on how much they enjoyed the food. Dinner was just as delicious as our food tasting meeting and although we didn't try the appetizers beforehand, they were also a huge hit at our wedding. I highly recommend this place to anyone who looking for a Bay Area wedding venue- trust me, Bridges will take care of you and you won't regret it!

One of the best decisions I've ever made was selecting The Bridges as my wedding venue. I got married at the Bridges on 7/21/17, and it was without a doubt the most perfect day I c...

ould have ever imagined. From the moment I toured the Bridges (the grass terrace where the ceremonies take place, and the garden pavilion where the reception takes place) I completely fell in love. I had researched about 30 venues online, saw about 6 in person, and once I saw The Bridges, I knew it was the one. It was everything I was looking for in a venue - pretty view for the ceremony, and an open space for the reception. From the first interaction I had with Sandy and her team, I was blown away by their kindness, understanding, and responsiveness. Being in the event industry myself, I know how hard it is to keep up with all of the big and little details, e-mails, dates, etc. The way that Sandy and Celena worked made it seem like my wedding was the only big event they had to work on. Being a bride, there's nothing more you can ask for. Colby was an AWESOME day-of planner, and we will never forget our tasting with sweet Sylvia. The food was amazing (all of the guests LOVED their meals). I used Peters Photography, Denon & Doyle, and Pleasanton Rentals which are all preferred vendors - they were all great to work with as well! Sweet Events Bay Area did our dessert table/candy bar, and Traveling Tiger was our videographer - they were both amazing as well! I really do not have one thing to complain about. All brides should definitely look into having their wedding here.

nned for one year out and the dates were already competitive! We had our ceremony on the outdoor lawn, cocktail hour in the clubhouse and balcony space, and reception inside the large banquet hall (we did a venue buy-out). With 190 guests, it was worth it to rent the entire place! This gave us lots of space and freedom to move around and enjoy the venue. Initially we had almost chose another venue due to a better date, but so glad we didn't and stayed with The Bridges because they were the most perfect choice! The food was so good! During the food tasting, we made some notes and suggestions to alter the dishes to our liking such as less salt or more or less flavor here and there, and on the day of, they really took note of our preferences because the food came out exactly how we wanted, AND still warm from the kitchen. That's impressive. The staff is truly amazing and sincere. They go out of their way to make things happen and pay close attention to every detail.

Wow, wow, wow! That is all I have to say! My husband and I got married at The Bridges Golf Club this past weekend on the day after Thanksgiving. The wedding was nothing short of ma...

gical! After searching and touring over 20 different venues, we decided to go with the Bridges because they had all the elements that were were looking for. Their prices were reasonable, the space was beautiful, and it was very convenient for our guests. We booked them over a year and a half in advance. They are quite the popular wedding venue. We had our wedding on a Friday because they threw in a lot of extra perks for Friday or Sunday weddings. Not only were the meals discounted, but they also threw in gold chargers and chivari chairs. Most other venues were charging extra fees to rent those items (~$7 per chair). We decided to do the venue buyout, which meant that we did our ceremony outside on the Garden Terrace, our cocktail hour in the Clubhouse, and the reception in the Garden Pavilion. Sandy and her team were extremely helpful throughout the entire planning process. I must have emailed Sandy once a day in the month leading up to the wedding. She usually responded the next day and answered all of my questions. On the day of the wedding, their banquet manager Silvia was there to ensure everything went smoothly. She was in constant communication with our day of coordinator and she helped orchestrate all the behind the scenes tasks. Our wedding week said it was going to rain on our wedding day and Silvia eased my fears by saying that they can always make a switch to the inside Fireside room if it did start to rain that day. Fortunately, the weather ended up being perfect and we were able to have our outside ceremony. At the end of the night, my husband and I gave her a big hug as she wished us congratulations. Overall, I would highly recommend The Bridges Golf Club to anyone because they really can make your dream wedding come true!

Their event captain and the rest of the event staff were so well organized and made sure that the entire wedding ran smoothly from the ceremony set up to the sparkler send off and conclusion.

I really didn't have to think about anything on my wedding day besides just celebrating with family and friends! It is a beautiful venue (just go visit and you will see!), and it doesn't even need a lot of decoration/extra lighting, etc. to make it beautiful. The location is perfect; near lots of hotels, and close to the big bay area cities. I cannot say enough good things about the Bridges; they made my wedding day perfect, stress-free as possible, and so memorable.

merican cultures and traditions together. The day of the wedding was well organized, and the staff pulled out all stops to help us that evening and make our ceremony and reception go smoothly. We had the Bridges at full-capacity, with babysitters and children dining in another room next door. The people we dealt with on wedding day were amazing with their hustle: Sylvia and Jaime were very attentive and helped us to feel like family. We bought out the entire venue for the event. For pictures, Sylvia shuttled us and the photographers around in their golf cart limo, and that helped pictures to be done much faster. The appetizers they circulated before the reception were displayed elegantly and slightly tailored to suit our needs: we added a halal entrée, and a custom pita & hummus appetizer. Our guests were very satisfied with the food, reporting it was some of the best that they'd had as far as weddings go. The venue itself was stunning with a beautiful view of the hills, and at sunset, the reception halls were well lit by the sun with picturesque hills in the background. The venue is so nice, and décor so tasteful that you don't need too many added decorations. Overall, I was very impressed by the Bridges, and I loved my experience with them. Our only nitpicks were that we didn't want alcohol or sodas served at the wedding, but they couldn't offer us other options like iced tea or other non-alcoholic low sugar drinks during reception. Also just as an FYI, they don't allow taking home leftovers of their food, and if you are buying one expensive entrée from a higher level menu and other entrées from less expensive menus, they still charge as if all entrees were the higher price, which is too bad, but hey, its a business. Honestly I loved our wedding. Big thanks to Bridges staff for delicious food, awesome event coordinating and event management, prompt responses and helpful guidance.

The Bridges was worth every penny! We had amazing weather for our April 2016 5:00 pm wedding. Everything went smooth. We went with a Spanish theme and from the tile on the roof to ...

the roses in the garden everything flowed together. We had our ceremony outside on the grass with the white rose bushes as our back ground. Cocktail hour was held at the Club House and although it was warm out all the doors were opened to let our guest sit outside or inside. The Grand Pavilion was perfect, loved how there was enough space for our tables, there was more than enough room to dance and the sunset and night views were amazing. We planned our wedding for a little over a year and Sandy was great to work with. I do not regret anything at all, having our wedding at the Bridges was a dream come true.
