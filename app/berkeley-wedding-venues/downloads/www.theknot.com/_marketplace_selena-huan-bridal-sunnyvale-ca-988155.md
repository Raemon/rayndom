Selena, Judy, and her staff were super friendly and very helpful throughout the whole process. We ran into a few hiccups with making the dress and also shipping back and forth, but...

everything turned out wonderfully in the end. The final product was beautiful. There were a few issues while wearing the dress the night of, but nothing too crazy! Everyone complimented on how beautiful and unique the dress Selena designed for me. I could not have chosen a more professional or accommodating designer to work with. The colors of my dress, the layers, and the lace were all so very beautiful and elegant. I loved how the dress looked on me while trying it on after the final alterations all the way up to the end of the wedding night. The train was my favorite part. I cannot wait for our wedding photos to be sent to us so I can see how amazing everything will look. Thank you again for all your support, communication, and hard work. It truly paid off. I absolutely love my dress!

Apparently some people spend an entire year trying to find ‘the dress’. Granted, I was not the typical bride and my focus was not just on the dress however it does take time. I wen...

t to three or four higher end places and was not really impressed with the selection or the service. My wedding was three months away and I knew that I needed to find something fast or I would have to get something ‘off the rack’. There are no words to express how grateful I am for Selena Huan Bridal. They have wonderful self-designed collections and own their factories. So surprisingly, I was told that the dress I liked could be arrived in 2-months with made-to-measure services and they even still left 1-month for possible alternation. The service I received was fantastic, management truly went above and beyond to ensure that I was satisfied. The whole idea of trying on dresses, standing in front of a mirror surrounded by 8 other brides made me anxious and uncomfortable. Some people live for this moment but it was not my thing. This would not happen with Selena Huan Bridal. I had the whole 2nd floor, which left me enough privacy. I truly appreciate their made-to-measure service, which alleviated much alterations and fittings cost for me. You hear horror stories of brides spending thousands for additional alterations and salons just trying to take advantage. The seamstresses are phenomenal and went above and beyond to make everything perfect. I can’t say enough about how great they were. I had a destination wedding and when I left the store with my dress, they had it perfectly packaged, ready for travel. From start to finish everything was perfect and a wonderful experience. I’ll be forever grateful.

I am so grateful for Selena and her team. I got married on 8/4/18 in Michigan and I wanted a purple wedding dress. I've wanted a purple wedding dress for years, and had started to ...

think it wasn't possible. Everyone I spoke to either only made dresses in white or could get me a purple dress, but for an exorbitant price. I was feeling pretty discouraged when I stumbled upon Selena Huan Bridal, but I reached out anyway to see what she could do. I saw a design on her site that I liked a lot, but it was in white, so I wanted to see if she could make it in purple. I expected the worst, but she replied and said that she could make it happen. The result was a gorgeous, affordable purple gown that absolutely wowed my guests. I felt amazing in it and everyone is still talking about it. I can't tell you how much it means to have my dream of a purple wedding dress come true. I've been talking about it since I was a little girl, and Selena made it a reality! Once the professional photos come in, I will update my review to attach a picture!

wedding dress. SH makes my dream come true. The chief designer Selena communicates with you directly and gives you a design drawing combining your thoughts and her professional ideas. She went above and beyond to provide genuine advice. All I need to do is to trust them. The store itself has a very extensive selection of beautiful wedding dresses, including amazing dresses on sale. When I walked out of the store, I felt very happy and fortunate because of the excellent service provided by Judy and Cici. It was truly a perfect dress-shopping experience. Thank you Selena, Judy and Cici!

I was a little upset about a made dress coz you wouldn't know how it looks like on you, but it turns out to be far beyond my expectation. It fits perfect on me(the tailor they work with is very professional). I love the quality of the lace, and the price is reasonable too. Personally I really like their customer service. Different from other bridal dress boutique, their store is more intimate. They provide service to one customer at a time, Judy and her assistants are very professional and super sweet, I always feel so relaxed whenever I came back to their store. Thank you SH for making my wedding more perfect!

ich source of customization, definitely go here. They do offer independent designer artworks and really in good quality. It sounds cliche, but I honestly can't rave enough about Selena Huan Bridal. The shop itself is beautiful, clean, and smells heavenly! My consultant Cici was unbelievably sweet, and she completely got what vibe I was trying to explain I was going for. I received a hand written congratulations from her in the mail the following week, which was just so thoughtful and personalized. My dress and the veil I ordered all arrived much earlier than planned, and they made it really easy for me to find a time to pick everything up. I without a doubt will recommend them to anyone I know is getting hitched!

There is no words to describe how soft and smooth the fabric is. Extremely good and high-end quality. They offer customized design dress to meet every customers' needs. And their team member, Judy, was super friendly and has a rally good taste. The whole experience of shopping in Selena Huan Bridal was a A+. Highly recommend. Now my fiance think I'm crazy because I hang my dress in front of my bed and watch it fall asleep every day.

Selena Huan Bridal made finding my wedding dress effortless and fun! My bridal consultant was Jane and she was absolutely wonderful to work with! I knew I wanted something fitted, ...

however, was very up in the air on styles -- Jane was got a sense of my personality right away which made finding my dress that much easier. She also wasn't overly pushy so my family and I really enjoyed her honest feedback. All in all she was extremely knowledgeable. I went to 6-7 different bridal salons while shopping for my wedding dress and ended up returning to Selena Huan Bridal because the experience there was so much better than other places. At the end, I was deciding between a sample dress and a new dress. Jane never pressured me to buy the new one, even though her commission was probably much larger for that dress. She just laid out both options and let my mom and I make the final decision. Ms. Kim was my seamstress for alterations. I honestly wasn't sure what to think at first. She doesn't say much, but she was so kind. I changed my mind about the bustle, and she re-worked it right there at the fitting. She also refunded me part of the alterations payment because she didn't end up needing to do as much work as she had originally estimated. Finally when I picked up the dress, it fit perfectly. It was comfortable and looked great, and I couldn't have been happier with the outcome. I just picked up my wedding dress yesterday evening and was able to work with Jane again -- I'll be going back to her for my 5bridesmaid dresses too.

I searched online and in many wedding dress shops to find 'the dress of my dreams,' but it turned out that dress simply did not exist. However Selena made it for me and I couldn't...

have been happier. She provided a beautiful design initially based on the dress elements I knew I wanted, and she let me provide feedback throughout the design and creation process until the dress was just the way I envisioned. I would highly recommend Selena for her craftsmanship and her willingness to make your dream dress come true!

I HIGHLY recommend the Selena Huan Bridal Shop in Sunnyvale! Judy and Selena did an amazing job with my daughter Jenny ’s dress. They customized the design so that it was exactly ...

the princess dress Jenny wanted. They worked with Jenny to adjust the design so the fit was not too loose, not too tight, but “just right”, by coming up with a gorgeous “corset” back. While this involved two trips for the dress back to China, Judy managed everything beautifully, kept us informed, arranged for rapid transit as needed. She communicated with us professionally and often so that we did not need to worry about whether the dress would arrive in time. She guided us through our many questions (where is the strap for holding up the train? how do you tie the corset so that it is tight enough?). And she provided a custom-made beautiful size 8 flower girl dress that made Jenny’s niece feel like a princess too! Judy made the “experience” for this mother-of-the-bride and bride feel very special. (We had visited several other bridal shops in the area), welcoming us warmly, and helping us with every step along the way, including shipping various items from California to Maryland, where the wedding took place (in December 2018).

I browsed through a lot of dress brand before for about 3 months and I really think the quality of their dress is comparable with a lot brands pricing between $2500-$4000.
