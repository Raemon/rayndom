My Husband also got his hair done the day of (curly shoulder length hair). He had never really gotten his hair done before- and was so happy with the job that Erin did! The Pretty Committee in general was one of the best communicators out of all of the vendors we hired. From beginning to end, they were great to work with! I would definitely recommend them! :)

Not only are Ariel and Jasmine incredibly skilled, but they were also so sweet, calming, and professional throughout the entire process. Their energy made the getting-ready experience so much fun and stress-free! If you're looking for hair and makeup artists who will make you look and feel absolutely incredible on your big day, The Pretty Committee is the way to go!

And my makeup stayed on the whole night (it also made a fantastic recovery after I cried during the private vow exchange before the ceremony).

We had a large group of ladies getting ready (me, 5 bridesmaids, 2 moms, and a niece) and they were able to keep us pretty on track timewise. We did fall a little behind schedule. ...

I did have a different artist day of than did my trial due to an artist having a family emergency (totally understandable) and I felt like they did a good job of immediately connecting me with a replacement and checking in with me to make sure it was okay. Everyone was satisfied with their hair and makeup, and I think they did a good job of working with a variety of skin tones and hair textures. That said, it did rain on the day so my curls obviously fell. I don't fault them for that, there is only so much you can do with rain! I just wanted to point it out to say that I felt like my hair still looked good and it looked even better before we got rained on. (: The same could be said for my bridesmaids - we all needed touch ups before the ceremony. In full transparency, I did feel like the travel cost was a bit high (around $75 per artist) for them to travel from GR to South Haven. That would be my only major issue, but it was also shared upfront so something I was aware of!

3 hours! She got all 8 of us done before the scheduled time which was amazing!! She executed everyone’s inspiration pictures flawlessly. Everyone loved their hair and could not say enough good things about Kelsey!! I highly recommend her to anyone!!! 5 stars for Kelsey!!! I originally booked them for both services but after the trial I was unhappy with my makeup. They are very responsive which was so helpful throughout this whole process. One of the things I did not like about this group was that they assign you a hair stylist and makeup artist after you pay your deposit so you do not have a say in who you get. I felt that the pictures they had posted on The Knot and other websites did not at all reflect the makeup service I received. I asked to change MUA and they got me someone else but after looking online at her profile, I still did not think it was the look I was paying to get. I canceled my makeup services and thought that I could move my money over to just hair services. A member of the group originally said I could but then as it got closer they said they could not move my money over to be allocated solely for hair services. I was frustrated with the misunderstanding and with the loss of money. Overall, I would say if you want someone specific book with them individually and look at their social media and the artists for more accurate representation of their services.

The Pretty Committee did a fantastic job with my wedding party's hair and make up the day of my wedding. They listened tl each of the ladies' requests and executed them perfectly. ...

They were timely, professional, and polite. I would highly recommend them for any of your hair and make up needs! -Dani

TPC Stylist Candace was an absolute dream to work with for my own wedding! She knocked it out of the park on both my hair and makeup. I would book her or this company again!

My hair completely fell out 20 minutes after the stylists did it, leaving my bridesmaids scrambling to redo it 10 minutes before first look. When I requested a refund, it took them...

2 months to complete it. This was the 1 thing about my wedding I would do differently.

skin. (Kim) my husband even commented how natural it looks but enhances my beauty. The hair (kellen) was so effortless on her part and even though all I did was put it up in a bun, she managed not to stab me with any Bobby pins ha that's a first.. Book them!

The communication, professionalism, and energy was great! The hairstylist was amazing, and they were very punctual. The only reason I gave 3 stars was the makeup. In our getting re...

ady room it looked great, but it was a hot summer day and my maid of honors makeup was literally running all down her face and got extremely blotchy before we even got to the ceremony. We had to wash it all off and my bridesmaids helped her redo it during our first look. I did my own makeup and it lasted all day no problem. Prior to that she really liked her makeup, it would have been great for a cooler day, but unfortunately I don’t feel that enough attention was given to her base to last during a summer wedding (which for wedding makeup I feel like should happen regardless as photos are taken all day long). She did help one of my other bridesmaids who had originally opted to do her own makeup which was very nice, I just wish it was more long lasting.

I wired with Pretty Committee for my May 2023 wedding. I booked them off of a recommendation from my planner, Tanya Lynette Events. They made the booking process really simple and ...

overall so easy to work with. The stylists I worked with were all great, and a special shout out to Alicia and Erin. They understood exactly what I wanted and seamlessly made it happen. Alicia was so kind, and even sourced a peachier blush after I mentioned it during the trial. Highly recommend these two.

The Pretty Committee did a wonderful job with our wedding. We had a large group (9 people getting both hair & make-up) and the team of 3 stylists (Erin, Arielle, and Candace) handl...

ed it with ease. The fact that they travel to the wedding location is a huge bonus (one less thing to worry about on a busy day). Erin did my hair and Arielle did my make-up and both did an excellent job listening to exactly what I wanted and making adjustments after my trial. They actively took notes to make sure everything was perfect. I would definitely recommend The Pretty Committee!

I had a great experience working with the Pretty Committee for my wedding day! Kelsey and Tabatha did a great job on hair and makeup for me and several members of my bridal party. ...

The wedding was up in Traverse City and they drove up from Grand Rapids and were there and ready to start by 8am. They were responsive and very flexible, able to provide great service for those with specific visions as well as those who needed inspiration or recommendations. Carla (the manager/owner) was also very helpful when I had questions about payment! My hair and makeup stayed beautiful all night and I got so many compliments. I would definitely recommend The Pretty Committee!

Scheduling with TPC was not as seamless as one would hope. I had my hair and makeup trial scheduled for a month, maybe more, and suddenly a week before my trial I received an email...

that it was rescheduled. I had also strategically scheduled a boudoir photo shoot after those trial appointments, so the change was not ideal. I emailed and eventually got them back to the original date and times. But the added stress was not appreciated by an already stressed out bride. For the services, both Stevie (makeup) and Anna (hair) were great. Stevie even saved the day for my Aunt who had her makeup done elsewhere and it turned out awful. Thanks again, Stevie :)
