Taleen Keuftedjian

Wedding Planner

Hi, Future Newlyweds! Happy you’re here to explore your wedding dreams with me. I’m Taleen, the heart behind Beyond Lace Events. I’m passionate about love, happiness, and helping couples create weddings that truly reflect their story. It all began with friendship and a spark of love. One by one, four of my closest friends got engaged, and somehow, I became the one they turned to for help bringing their dreams to life. What started as helping out soon became something much deeper. While they were overwhelmed by budgets, timelines, and details, I found pure joy in every moment. Organizing, designing, and finding creative ways to make their day feel magical. That’s when I knew this wasn’t just something I was good at, it was something I was meant to do. After nearly twenty years in corporate financial planning and budgeting, I saw how quickly weddings could become overcomplicated and overpriced. I wanted to change that to create weddings that were full of heart, creativity, and affordable luxury. That’s how Beyond Lace came to life: a space where creativity meets intention, and love is celebrated in its truest form. Today, I help couples design weddings that feel stunning, meaningful, and uniquely theirs, all while staying affordable. Because you shouldn’t have to sacrifice your dream to make it attainable. You just need someone who knows how to bring beauty, balance, and budget together. With Beyond Lace, we don’t follow the rules, we create something beautifully you: heartfelt, timeless, unforgettable, and affordable.

We hired Taleen as our partial planner for our 2025 wedding. She’s super easy to work with and brought such a calm, positive energy to every step of the pre-wedding planning. Our w...

edding turned out perfect and fit our budget exactly as we wanted. Our ceremony started 20 minutes late because a lot of guests were stuck in traffic. I don’t know how she did it but she managed to keep the timeline on track even though we started late. Leading up to the wedding, she kept us in the loop without drowning us in details, which we really appreciated. Thank you, Taleen, for all your help. We’ll definitely be recommending you to others in the future!

This review is way overdue, but I recently referred a friend to Beyond Lace and realized I needed to leave one too! From our very first consultation, Taleen was warm, engaged, and ...

so generous with her time, chatting all things wedding even before we officially booked her. We hired Taleen as our day of wedding coordinator, and I can honestly say it was one of the best decisions we made. Even though we only hired her for coordination, she was always available to answer questions and offer advice throughout the planning process. Our wedding day went so smoothly, and if there were any issues, I had no idea, which was amazing! I was incredibly stressed in the weeks leading up to the wedding, and being able to lean on Taleen was such a blessing. I would 1000% recommend her to any couple looking for someone who’s kind, professional, and truly cares about your day.

ng her was a lifesaver. She helped with everything, from the venue, design ideas, local vendor recommendations, timelines, and became a true friend we could lean on. Taleen was calm, organized, and always upbeat, even when things got stressful. She kept us on track, handled all the tricky details, and made sure our day went smoothly. She even gave us a little gift for our wedding. Not sure if that's something other planners do, but it shows she really cares. On the wedding day, I didn’t have to worry about a thing. Everything looked perfect, and it honestly made me want to cry happy tears! If you’re getting married, you NEED Taleen. She’ll make your day everything you dreamed of and more.

Taleen helped us find affordable vendors we couldn’t have found on our own, which gave us more budget for the things that mattered most. From the very first meeting to the wedding ...

day, we felt completely supported and taken care of. She guided us through every decision, kept us on track with our budget, and offered advice whenever we hit wedding planning roadblocks. On the wedding day, she even calmed my anxiety with simple breathing exercises so I could truly enjoy every moment. Everything went smoothly, and our guests kept commenting on how well the day ran. She’s great, and I could tell she really cares about what she does. I would definitely recommend her!
