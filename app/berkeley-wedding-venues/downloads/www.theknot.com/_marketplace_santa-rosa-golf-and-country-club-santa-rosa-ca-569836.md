Our wedding at Santa Rosa Golf and Country Club was everything we had hoped for and more. From the very first meeting to the final moment of the night, everything was seamless, bea...

utifully organized, and filled with genuine care. The team made us feel completely supported and went above and beyond to bring our vision to life. They allowed many opportunities to customize and create the unique wedding of our dreams. They were flexible and accommodating for all of our requests. We had a bicultural wedding with two ceremonies, and everything was executed flawlessly. Communication was always prompt and thorough. We were always in good hands! Director Annabel and Coordinator Amanda deserve endless thanks. Their kindness, calm presence, and meticulous attention to detail made the entire experience unforgettable. They ensured every element reflected exactly what we wanted, and because of them, our day truly felt magical.

We loved working with Santa Rosa Golf & Country Club!! Tess is amazing and was super helpful throughout the entire process! She met with me many times and answered numerous emails,...

even going out of her way to arrange it so there was Peruvian beer available for our guests (my husband is Peruvian—he was soooo excited!!). Tess worked with me to figure out the room layout, food selection, and schedule for the day, giving us a lot of flexibility with everything so that it matched our unique styles. I always felt very respected and like they cared about me as an individual (even though they were crazy busy with many other events). The ballroom is gorgeous!! And the covered patio outside allowed for a perfect reception in November when you never know what the weather will be! We got to do photos on the golf course which were beautiful! Tess made it so that the whole process from touring the place to our actual wedding day went smoothly! I’d highly recommend this venue to anyone getting married in Sonoma County!!
