Colleen Clarke

Lead Designer

My name is Colleen, and I am the creative force behind Coll of the Wild Creations. My journey began in 2018 with my passion for macramé, and during the pandemic, I expanded into floral design. Over the past five years, I’ve dedicated myself to honing my craft and discovering my unique design aesthetic. I specialize in bohemian-inspired florals but love working in a variety of styles to bring each couple's wedding vision to life. Watching the joy on my clients' faces as they see their dream come together is the most rewarding part of what I do.

We couldn't have been happier with our experience working with Coll of the Wild Creations for our wedding! From the very beginning, Colleen's communication was outstanding—she took...

the time to understand our vision and worked with us every step of the way, making sure every detail was perfect. She was incredibly flexible, accommodating changes and offering creative suggestions that elevated our original ideas. On our wedding day, the floral arrangements were beyond anything we could have imagined. The designs were breathtaking—lush, artistic, and full of personality. Every bouquet, centerpiece, and installation brought our venue to life and made the entire day feel magical. Colleen truly understood what we were looking for and exceeded all our expectations. Working with her was such a joy, and her passion for her craft really showed through every element she created. We received so many compliments from our guests, and it was all thanks to her incredible talent and dedication. If you want a florist who listens, creates stunning work, and makes the process enjoyable, Coll of the Wild Creations is the best choice. We are so grateful for everything she did to make our day unforgettable!

I don’t even know where to begin; Coll of the Wild Creations absolutely blew me away! From the moment I first spoke with Colleen, I knew I was in the best hands. I came to her with...

a general idea and a color palette, and what she created was beyond anything I could’ve imagined. She took my vision and elevated it into something truly magical each arrangement was a work of art. Her boho meets garden style is perfection. Every bloom felt intentionally chosen, and the way she blends textures, tones, and movement into her designs is pure talent. Walking down the aisle with my bouquet felt like a dream. I’ve never felt more seen or heard in a creative process. She just gets it and then she takes it up ten notches! Not only is she incredibly artistic, but her professionalism is unmatched. She’s organized, communicative, punctual, and genuinely passionate about what she does. I had complete trust and confidence in her from start to finish and she delivered above and beyond. If you are a bride wanting that effortlessly romantic, garden inspired or bohemian floral look, do not hesitate to book her. You’ll be floored by what she creates. I will forever be grateful she was part of our wedding day.
