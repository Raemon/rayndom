35 Years of Love, Celebrated with B.R. Cohn's Finest! ​My spouse and I recently had the immense pleasure of visiting B.R. Cohn Winery to celebrate our 35th wedding anniversary, and it truly exceeded every expectation. From the moment we arrived...

, the ambiance was perfect—elegant yet relaxed, setting the ideal stage for such a special milestone. ​The wine, of course, was the highlight. Every single pour we sampled was exceptional. The wines were complex, smooth, and truly showcased the incredible quality B.R. Cohn is known for. It was the kind of wine that makes a memory even better, and we left with several bottles to continue the celebration at home. ​Beyond the wine, the hospitality was top-notch. The staff was incredibly welcoming, knowledgeable, and attentive, ensuring our anniversary celebration felt unique and cared for. ​We couldn't have imagined a more perfect place to raise a glass to 35 wonderful years. B.R. Cohn Winery is a must-visit for anyone in the Sonoma area, whether you're celebrating a major milestone or just looking for truly outstanding wine and an unforgettable experience. Thank you for making our day so memorable!

Five-star experience. B.R. Cohn Winery brings together heritage, hospitality, and atmosphere in a way that feels both authentic and effortlessly enjoyable. Bruce Cohn’s legacy as manager for the Doobie Brothers and Little Feat adds a unique cul...

tural dimension that clearly carries through the property’s personality. The outdoor seating is expansive and well-designed for lingering, making it an ideal stop for a relaxed afternoon. On our visit, the live band elevated the energy, while a quality food truck rounded out the experience with smart, casual pairing options. This is a winery that understands how to activate space, music, and wine into a cohesive guest experience—easygoing, well-executed, and worth the stop.
