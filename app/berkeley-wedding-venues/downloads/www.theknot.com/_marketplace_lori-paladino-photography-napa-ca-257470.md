We reached out to several photographers for our destination wedding and Lori was the first photographer to respond to our inquiry. Right away she set up a time to talk over the pho...

ne and I immediately felt worry free. Lori not only did a great job photographing our wedding, but she went out of her way to make our day as easy as possible. It was clear that we were the priority and nothing is more important to her than the client. She even customized her wedding package to fit within our wedding schedule and budget. The day of the wedding, Lori showed up ready to go with additional shooters to make sure no moments were missed. I was really stressed about family photos and bridal party photos. She had me fill out a list of everyone prior to the wedding so that we could seamlessly go from one family photo to the next. I just got our sneak peek photos back and they are breathtaking! They aren't "overly edited" with crazy filters. They look natural and like we knew what we were doing (Lori prompted us very well for every photo). You won't be disappointed with her work and support!

d very comfortable photographing couples and weddings. This is so important! Your photographer is with you all the time, so if they are comfortable around you, that is key. She was always present to capture the most important moments, but not at all overbearing. We were so happy with how everything turned out. Her photos are to die for. The quality is wonderful and she captures beautiful light and vibrant colors. We are having such a hard time deciding on what photos to order because they are all awesome!! You can’t go wrong with Lori!

Incredible photography. We had Sandra and second shooter, Laurie. They were both great and very easy to work with. The attention to detail was the key as they were able to capture ...

us at the best moments and in the best light. Sandra demonstrated a lot of patience and professionalism with the family portraits and trying to wrangle toddlers into posing. We now have some memorable photos that we will cherish and already are focal points in our living room. The photos captured our wedding perfectly and we will be able to remember every detail now with our photo collection. Thank you to Sandra and Laurie.

Simply put, Lori is the best. Photography was one of the most important things to my husband and me when planning our wedding, and Lori didn't disappoint. Our engagement sessio...

n set the mood ahead of time: We wanted a fun session that had a combination of nontraditional and traditional moments, and it was hard to select our favorites among the bunch. The same held true for the wedding. Lori (and her second shooter, who was amazing) captured the day expertly, from our getting-ready shots to the wedding and the reception. More than a year later, we're still going through our photos, and many of them are on our walls too. But the best part was how easy Lori is to work with. She listens to what her clients want, offers suggestions or provides advice, and the end result is a wonderful collaboration. Her correspondence is fast and friendly, and her personality is one where you feel like she's a guest at your wedding, moonlighting as an amazing artist. She put everyone at ease instantly, which is a mark of a genuinely lovely person. We would recommend (and have!) Lori again and again. You won't find anyone better.

Lori was INCREDIBLE. The photos of our wedding were absolutely gorgeous- she was able to capture some of the most beautiful moments of my wedding, especially candid photos where I ...

did not even know she was there. I plan on using Lori for all future family photos and will recommend her to anyone I know getting married. Aside from the amazing photos, she is truly a genuine and caring person. She really took the time to get to know my husband and I and helped to capture those moments that meant the most to us. Hands down the best photographer a bride could ask for.

My husband and I cherish our wedding photos. Lori did an outstanding job of photographing our rehearsal evening and wedding day. We planned our San Francisco wedding while living...

in Hong Kong and Lori made the process smooth sailing. She sent us some detailed questions in the run up to the day, getting a feel for us as a couple. When she arrived at our rehearsal venue, I felt like I knew her and she has an incredible way of making everyone feel comfortable in front of the camera so no one felt stiff or unsure. Her gentle directions make her photos natural and frankly, gorgeous. She has a very calming energy on what can be a highly strung day and kept everyone calm when we were getting ready (she also helped with an errant zipper on my sister's dress!!!) Lori is very helpful when it comes time to choosing your images and guided us through the process helping us choose the most spectacular photos. I cannot recommend Lori highly enough. My husband I have subsequently used Lori to photograph our maternity pictures, newborn and most recently, our daughter's first year photographs. Thank you Lori!

ork is absolutely incredible. The day after our wedding we got a few teaser pictures and WOW, they were insane. She has an eye for detail that I've never seen from another individual, and she executed flawlessly from start to finish. My husband is not one for lots of pictures and she made him feel so great about every shot. I am a very type A personality, but I didn't worry for a second with Lori. Conclusion- if you want a photographer that will give you a product that will literally take your breath away, is one of the kindest people of all time and has more passion for her profession and business than most can even dream of then you hire Lori Paladino.

But most importantly, she is incredibly personable, sincere, kind, patient and understanding. Thank you Lori, you are the absolute best!!!

as a destination wedding and we live in Maryland, we were a little unsure of who to pick for this important part of our big day. We could not have made a better decision. Lori and her team made our day so special for us. I cry every time I see our beautiful slideshow of pictures. From the details of the photos to the perfectly chosen music, I couldn't be happier. We are having our first child in December and have already thought about flying out for our first family photo shoot with Lori. Thanks again for making our day so memorable.

I had literally HUNDREDS of people reach out to me on Facebook about the quality of our wedding pics- and I am not that popular, haha. I would recommend her without hesitation. We eloped, and it was so important to us to have our day documented not only for us, but for our family and friends who weren't there to witness it in person. And here's what's true, regardless of the size of your wedding or the number of people present: At the end of the [most important] day [of your life], all you have are beautiful memories; Lori gives you them in tangible form. You cannot put a price on that. We will cherish these photos for the rest of our lives.

I was more than happy to splurge on a high quality photographer as this will let me relive the best day of my life now and forever :-) Thank you Thank you Lori, you have a gift!

ing, she made sure to confirm via a detailed questionnaire what our exact preferences were regarding things like posed photos versus candid shots, different categories of pictures (first looks, family photos, shots taken at sundown), and the overall vibe we had in mind for our wedding. The day of the wedding, Lori was GREAT. She is super personable and friendly, and is also sure to maintain communication with the bride and groom about how things are going and minor questions that come up throughout the course of the day. Our families had a lot of requests for specific portrait photos, and Lori was organized and handled the list like a pro. The best part, though, was the end result -- these photos are gorgeous. When I received Lori's slideshow of my wedding, I watched it three times in a row. The attention to detail and storytelling that is embedded in each shot are a testament to Lori's talent and experience.

way she perfectly captured our day. Lori and her assistant were present all day, from getting ready to the reception dance party. They were present and took photos but I never felt like they were intruding - which was really important to me on such an intimate (and special) day. Overall, they brought a ton of energy to a positive day, and provided us with great images within 3 weeks. She put together a "best of" album that really told a beautiful story of our wedding day. I would recommend her to anyone!

Weddings are stressful and there's a lot going on so there is a lot to be said for professionals who are cool, calm and collected under the pressure of a big day like a wedding! We would recommend Lori to anyone who wants to have an amazing collection of memories from a day that will surely be a full one!

She took time to get to know us, understand our styles and what we were looking for from our pictures, and the result was beyond anything I could have ever imagined. I think I have watched our slideshow 400 times already. All the pictures are breathtaking - and we've gotten so many compliments from people - many saying they wish they could do their wedding over just to have Lori take their pictures!! Beyond her amazing talent, Lori is the most calming, sweet soul to have as part of your day. You can tell she loves what she does, and it shows in each picture. HIRE LORI!! She will capture your day unlike anyone else can, I can guarantee it.

The slideshow that Lori put together for us selecting various photos of our day (great song selections too) brought back wonderful memories of our special day. It brings tears of joy for everyone who has viewed the slideshow. We cannot recommend Lori enough. She really is amazing! Thank you Lori for making our wedding day even more special...

When we started planning our 7/25/2014 wedding, choosing the right photographer was at the very top of my priority list. I did an exhaustive search on the Knot and other sites, and...

I kept seeing Lori Paladino come up. I found galleries of her pictures, and I was so impressed. I called and emailed several photographers before her, and none of them were the right fit. But when I called Lori, I instantly knew she was going to be great for us. She is so friendly, warm, and a great listener. Right off the bat she had some great suggestions (before we even booked her!), and she made us feel very comfortable. Morever, she really provided the very best service for the price. To me, the most important question to ask for all parts of wedding planning should be ‘is it worth it?’ And she was worth every penny. Our pictures couldn’t have turned out better. Lori and her second photographer braved the 103 degree Napa heat with SMILES and never ever stopped shooting! Several of our guests commented on how much they appreciated being included in all of the pictures. She captured every single moment that we wanted to remember, and we couldn’t be happier with them. And we get to keep ALL of them! The hardest part is figuring out which ones to print and frame. I would highly recommend booking Lori to be your photographer. We had high expectations, but she truly blew us away! Thank you, Lori!

ister was married at our venue and used Lori for her photographs. I believe the quality of Lori's work speaks for itself. Her photographs are absolutely stunning!! What I appreciated most about working with Lori was how she genuinely cared for my fiance and I as we talked with her about what we wanted with our photographs. She spent over an hour on the phone (and exchanged numerous emails) with me before I even signed a contract so she could understand our vision and see if she might be a good fit for us. Unlike many other vendors I spoke with, Lori listened, asked pertinent questions, and was so friendly and likeable! During the planning process, Lori made signing the contract, making payments, and discussing the Day-Of plan STRESS FREE! She personalized our payment plan to fit our needs and was incredibly organized so that our wedding day went so smoothly. Lori and her team were punctual and very professional at our wedding. They made everyone feel so comfortable-they have an easygoing but very structured approach (she kept the pace going so we'd stay on time, but was sweet the entire time). Numerous people told me they didn't even realize a photographer was at our wedding (which is what I wanted-no distractingly loud and in-you-face cameras). Lori captured every meaningful moment of our wedding day. When I look at the photographs she took, I am immediately transported back to that very moment and can feel the emotions and thoughts that were running through my heart and head. You will LOVE your photos if you work with Lori!!! Lori sent us a beautiful wood-engraved USB of our photos very soon after our wedding. I have yet to design our wedding album with Lori, but I am so confident that it will be a breeze because so far, Lori has made the entire photography process simple, enjoyable, and rewarding! Lori answers emails and phone calls quickly, genuinely cares, works with an amazing team, and will take care of you so that your wedding photographs will be a precious heirloom. You can tell that she truly loves photography and capturing special moments for her clients! Booking with Lori was the best decision I made! She books up quickly so go book her now!!! Also-her instagram makes me swoon-Napa scenery, her adorable kids, and gorgeous weddings!

Lori came highly recommended to us by one of my girlfriends who had worked with her for her wedding. In my girlfriend's words, 'Lori is so sweet, you would want to hang out with h...

er as a friend.' True to form, Lori put us at ease as soon as we met her. She explained the process of her wedding photography with patience, and was flexible with tailoring a timeline that fit our priorities and our budget. Up to our wedding day, all of our communications were clear and easy, through a digital portal that she had set up for us. She was also available to walk through our venue with us before the wedding and was very receptive to our ideas and opinions. On the day of the wedding, Lori was attentive, detail-oriented and very easy to work with. As with a previous reviewer, my husband and I were nervous that we would look awkward in the photographs, but she had a knack for encouraging our personalities to shine through. Lori and her assistant both were skillful in capturing the 'action' but never being in the way. We really appreciate (and don't quite understand) how they got so many amazing shots without our noticing. We were completely surprised when, a month later, Lori sent us a digital slideshow that integrated our wedding song. It was priceless to relive the memories of that day, and doubly so because we did not hire a videographer. The time and effort that Lori had spent to put together a slideshow really showed how much she cares about each wedding. She delivered exactly what she had promised (and more). We are tremendously grateful for Lori and her assistant in making our wedding such a happy occasion to remember.

and comforting. She listened to what we were looking for and was very accommodating, offering wonderful suggestions and tips based on her years of experience. My husband and I are not very comfortable in front of the camera and were worried that we would look very unnatural in our photos. Luckily, Lori is such a pleasure to spend time with that we were able to just be ourselves and be at ease the entire day. Lori is calm and organized - letting the day simply happen and working her magic behind the scene. The photos were absolutely magnificent and bring back such wonderful memories from our special day that we will have for years to come. The rich emotions of pure joy and happiness shine through, as does the ambiance and feel of the entire day. Lori captured our day perfectly -- accurately and beautifully. Everyone we have shared our photos with is absolutely amazed by Lori's work and her natural ability to capture the small moments that together tell the story of our wedding day. We could not be more thrilled to have had the chance to work with Lori and would highly recommend Lori to anyone!

lot of money so Lori worked with us on a package that met our needs within our budget. Most importantly, her photos were beautifully crafted and we didn't even notice she was there. This is hard to do and Lori pulled it off expertly. Since I am also a photographer I tend to be more critical than most customers and Lori didn't disappoint. I stopped short of giving her 5 stars on quality only because some of the processed photos were a little bit overexposed, but it wasn't a big deal since I was able to easily adjust them with my own photo software. In summary I would recommend Lori to anyone and I am very pleased with the overall value that she provided.

When we finally met Lori on our wedding day, we were pleasantly surprised by how cool and calm she was and her ability to move things along all the while taking many great shots. I don't remember ever feeling like a photographer was really there but she and her assistant that day, Luke, were just fabulous. They directed us in some cases (family shots, formals, etc) but for the most part, they just did their thing, blended in, and let us and our guests enjoy the wedding. Fast forward to when she sent us our photos. Oh my... words cannot describe how beautiful they are. Lori and her team did wonders with our photos and we are so happy she was the one we chose. You will not be disappointed with Lori. She is professional and one of the best there is. Thank you, Lori, for our beautiful photos!

I did not want in a photographer and I instantly trusted Lori to deliver beautiful photographs that truly reflected me, my fiance, our family and our emotions. She did just that. She was efficient, organized, calming and respectful. At my wedding, I did not notice her nor her lovely additional photographer, yet they captured every moment of our incredible day. Lori has an elegant and simple aesthetic that allows the wedding to shine for itself...with a little help, of course! My experience continued to be wonderful as I painstakingly chose my pictures. Lori made this possibly stressful chore so easy by providing me with a "highlights" section that she had already touched up and organized. I was not obligated to choose any of the pictures in this section, but it was wonderful to see our wedding unfold in such a beautiful and natural way. I will hire Lori to document every major event in my life!

As I write this, the slideshow of Adam's and my wedding that Lori crafted is playing in the background. I am so grateful to have these as they are certainly one of our newest and m...

ost cherished family treasures. From the get, Lori's kind, patient manner and experience proved to be a huge help to us. She guided us in our choices around a first look and family portraits always steering us towards reality and the assurance that it would all be gorgeous and that there was no need to worry. Lori was patient and professional with my Nana, who, in her Nana way, had lots of questions. When we met at our venue to scope out the light and the space, our visit left me with confidence that I could completely turn it over and Lori would make it beautiful. Both Lori and her assistant Marita were so much more than photographers on our wedding day. They were a constant, calming presence with a mission for bringing out the best in everyone around and shedding light on special moments. Lori helped me take some boudoir shots and made me feel totally at ease and lovely. She captured the pre-wedding feeling amongst the bridesmaids without a staging anything. She and Marita herded what seemed like a million family members set on mingling and celebrating with ease and efficiency. Adam and I never felt rushed or like we were wasting our wedding posing for photos. It was a magical thing to see a sneak peek of our pictures just two days later. Our slideshow and full gallery were up not long after and were user friendly enough that my elderly relatives figured them out with no problem. Every single photo in our collection is beautiful. Everyone looks great. The light is delicious. There are moments of joy, big and small, in each photograph. Lori shaped the shots in way that captures everything that was so incredible about our wedding. Somehow, they seem drenched in the love we felt that day. If I could do it all over again, I wouldn't change one thing. Thank you Lori.

Lori was absolutely amazing. She did our engagement photos and our wedding photos, and we were thrilled with all of them. My husband and I hadn't done professional photos together ...

before our engagement photos, so we were concerned about looking unnatural or uncomfortable in front of the camera. Lori made us feel really comfortable and it really shows in our photos. On the day of our wedding, she and her team were professional, kind, patient, and caring. They were really organized, but also very easy going and flexible. Lori made sure to understand in advance what style photographs we were looking for, and she captured our day perfectly. When we shared our photos with family and guests, they were all blown away by them. Again and again people have told us how our photos captured us and the event perfectly. Also, we have big families and Lori did a wonderful job coordinating large groups of people. We cannot believe that we ended up with photos of our entire families in which everyone looks great! It's a miracle! We also really liked the online tools that Lori uses. It was really easy to share our photos and select for printing. We have a lot of friends who have gotten married, and have therefore spent a great deal of time on photographers websites looking at photos, and I think Lori's system is the best we've seen/used. It was such a relief working with Lori - she made us feel comfortable throughout the process and not once was I ever concerned that we would end up with great photos. We know we'll cherish these images forever!

I fell in love with Lori's photos after seeing the photos of a friends wedding come back that she had shot. Her photos are so crisp and really seem to capture the people in them in...

an authentic, but beautiful way. I immediately called her and worked with her on a package that would met my individual needs. Lori was easy to work with, very organized with her planning tools, available to work through the plans in advance and most importantly, made everyone so comfortable throughout the wedding day. She and her staff blended in, but also made sure we caught all key moments. During the ceremony and reception, they made sure to check in and plan the key moments we wanted in a way that was not intrusive at all, but made it easy to relax and took any concern off of me about wanted to make sure we got certain shots. In the end, the photos were beautiful and I love Lori's slideshows. Lori sends an immediate slide show of her favorite pictures and allows you to download those immediately which is fantastic to get you started with your pictures. Then she uploads the remaining photos to a site where you can compare and select the final one's in your package. Getting the initial photos up front made it much easier to take my time picking the full set of pictures. All in all, I was incredibly happy with selecting Lori as my photographer. She could not have been a better part of the team during my wedding and now I have incredible pictures that will help us remember all of the important moments of the day!

Lori is an absolutely amazing photographer. Not only is she good at what she does, but she's easy to work with. She was so helpful on our wedding wedding day. I really can't tha...

nk her enough. The day after our wedding Lori emailed us 5 sneak peak pictures. Oh my gosh, I can't tell you how excited I was when I saw these images. They were absolutely perfect pictures. Everyone is nervous about how they will turn our in pictures. Lori made me look wonderful in our wedding pictures. The sneak peak images were incredible but ultimately it just made me want more :) Lori has a wedding blog online, so when your pictures are finished being edited, she posts some on her blog and writes a little something about the couple. It's such a nice touch. You really know that Lori LOVES what she does for a living. This isn't just a job for her. She really loves photography. She is a true artist. I loved our wedding slideshow. You get to pick 2-3 songs for Lori to use and you can send the link to family and friends. It's a great way to share your pictures. I loved it. We really have sooooo many AWESOME, AMAZING, FANTASTIC, PERFECT wedding pictures. It's so hard to choose which ones to put in frames in our house. I want to frame them all and make our house into a wedding shrine, just kidding :) A family member of ours got married a few months before we did and we got to see the final wedding images. I can honestly say she only had a couple of keepers out of the thousands of images the photographer took. That is the complete opposite with us. When every single one of your pictures could truly be in a magazine, you know you have one heck of a photographer. Our family and friends couldn't believe how beautiful the pictures came out. Several people told us that they belong in magazines and complimented Lori's work. It was a great feeling. Lori captured our big day perfectly. No one could've done a better job. I knew she was going to do a great job just by talking to her and seeing her work on her website, but she still exceeded all expectations. We live out of state, but I can't wait to travel back to the Napa Valley area and have Lori take family pictures of us one day. I would highly recommend Lori Paladino to anyone. She's one of a kind!!

er. She was my "wing woman" on my wedding day. Calm and poised throughout the wedding day she was my pillar of support and tranquility. She wasnt overbearing and yelling like I see with other wedding photographers. And like a ninja she delivers the best pictures and got amazing shots. any photographer can take good pictures but She takes the extra effort to get to know you, find out exactly your style and executes it to perfection. I cant say enough about Lori and her quality of service. I plan to have her be a part of many more milestones in my life as there is no one else I would trust to capture such important moments.

lot of them for our wedding day. On the wedding day, Lori arrived early and stayed late. She was SUPER organized the entire time I worked with her. She made sure she had a list of all of the shots I was looking for. What I liked the best is her ability to capture the moments and emotions of the day. We got some great posed shots, but I loved her candid shots even more. She is so professional and wasn't intrusive at all. She made the day go so easy and we love our pictures!

Lori photographed my wedding and she managed to capture the true emotion in every person's face in various moments throughout the ceremony and reception. She made sure my husband ...

and I were so comfortable around her, which was easy for her since she is so relaxed, professional, and fun! She listened so carefully to all the elements important to us to capture and she photographed those moments/memories and so much more. I have gotten so many compliments on my photos and we still can't decide on a favorite since there are so many. The photographs are so incredible and when we look back at them we can see the emotion we were feeling in each moment! Lori was so easy to work with and added so much joy and happiness to our wedding day! I have recommended to every person I know getting married and think she takes the best photographs hands down!! Our photographs are beautifully displayed in our home and every time someone comes over they ask who our photographer was! It made the day so easy trusting Lori and being with not only an amazing photographer, yet a wonderful person!

calming presence. Lori was a joy to work with during our entire wedding process. The engagement photo session was really fun and helped us prepare for all of the photos during our wedding day. We loved the digital slideshow Lori put together with our engagement shots. Lori and her team were great to work with on our wedding day. Lori took time the time to get to know us and really listened to our goals for photography during the wedding. We made a list of important family and friend shots to get, but when we reviewed the photos after the wedding we were so impressed with all of the moments they captured without us even noticing they were there. We really liked the wedding album options that Lori offers and we are so pleased with the final photos! We recommend Lori completely and I look forward to working with her again in the future. I trust her to capture all of the most important moments in my life!

Lori Paladino is an amazing photographer and we would recommend her to anyone! Lori photographed our wedding at Trentadue Winery in August 2011 and we could not have asked for mor...

e from a photographer. We met with a few photographers in our selection process and decided to hire Lori within seconds after meeting her. She is organized, professional, and so helpful in the planning process. She had creative suggestions and was available to help with any questions along the way. She showed us samples of her work and albums in our initial meeting with her and we were blown away with her artistic approach and ability to bring out the emotion in the photographs. Besides her talent as a photographer, Lori is so warm and makes you feel relaxed and comfortable. My husband was dreading the photography process but Lori worked her magic and we had a great time on our wedding day. The day of our wedding, Lori and her team did an amazing job capturing the day. They were there for every moment but were not intrusive. Her team had notes and remembered everything we had asked them to focus on. She was flexible and open to anything we asked for. We don’t know much about photography so we relied on Lori and her team to suggest shots ideas and locations. She remembered all the shots we had requested and made sure we got all the family combination photos we wanted. Lori kept us on schedule throughout the night and grabbed us at just the perfect moments to capture the sun setting or a special moment. She knew the grounds and had a plan of where we were headed next and who was needed so we got the photos done quickly and spent most of the night celebrating with our family and friends. We got a beautiful slideshow very quickly after the wedding and our complete gallery about 3 weeks after the wedding. We were blown away but the amount of photos and fell in love with each and every one of them. Lori brought our wedding to life and captured the love, joy, and happiness that we experienced that night. We will forever have those memories and emotions to relive and share with our family and friends and most importantly, each other. I can’t say enough great things about Lori and because a picture is worth a thousand words, here is her blog link of our wedding so you can see her unbelievable work for yourself! http://www.loriphoto.com/blog/jen-jesse-trentadue-winery-wedding-photography-sonoma-wedding-photographer

Lori did an AMAZING job in photographing our wedding - she and her team captured every key moment and the emotion that each moment carried. When we look at the pictures now, we can...

truly feel the magic that we felt on that day all over again. One of the things she does pretty quickly after the wedding that really meant a lot to us, was that she creates a slideshow of selected images set to music to send over, and I have to admit, watching it brought tears to my eyes. She is incredibly talented and her slideshow let us relive the wedding - every emotion, every feeling, every smile - we were transported right back to each moment of our wedding day through her photos. We had family and friends come from all over the country, and for us, this was the perfect way to share the photos with all of them. I don’t know how she does it but she sifts through all of the pictures so quickly and picks the best ones! I’ll be honest, we still haven’t finished picking out all of our photos because the slideshow pictures were so perfect! I have a lot of friends who were not given a highlight reel by other photographers, and years later they still haven’t gone through their pictures and because of that, don’t have any wedding pictures hung up on the wall to enjoy. And isn’t that the point of the photos – to create lasting memories of the magic of your big day to actually see and enjoy!? Trust me – the highlight reel is awesome and will give you a huge jump start on your photo selection! We have the photos all over our house and I love seeing them every day! Lori is not only extremely talented, but she is such a warm and happy person - she will make you feel at ease with her presence and kind nature. You can just tell that she cares about you and your memories just as much as you do. We had a pretty extensive must-take list with all our family members, and Lori quickly (and with a smile) rounded up all the troops and hammered through that must-take list - actually calling the correct people by name! I still have no idea how she did that! All in all, Lori is perfection and will make sure your BIG day is captured forever in her timeless fashion.

Lori and her 2 photographer companions shot our wedding in 2009 and we are so thrilled with all the photos. (One of my favorite photos of us in the vineyard is actually displayed ...

on this page.) We know the wedding album we have will be a family heirloom for our kids and future grandkids. Lori is an absolute joy to be around, which is very important on a busy day with many details to take care of. Lori is artistic, well organized, professional, and a ton of fun! She helped us to plan the essential shots before, during, and after the ceremony and everything worked out perfectly. All of our family members and guests were also thrilled with the photos. Lori and her crew have a way with capturing the energy and emotion of the day in an effortless way. I've been around some photographers that can be a little demanding or obnoxious and that can affect your day and your photos. Lori made us laugh and smile. Once you met her, you will understand what I mean about her friendly and kind demeanor. We really appreciated how Lori took the time to get to know us during the planning process and the engagement session. During the wedding it was like hanging out with a friend and, by then, Lori knew what kind of photo style we liked the most. She is very creative and flexible so she'll give you a wide range of photos for you to choose from (portraits, scenery, small details, action shots...). I'm not a photographer so I don't know the correct terms here, but you get the idea. I recommend Lori to all my friends and family and have received many compliments on my wedding, engagement, and baby photos to which I have Lori to thank for. Her photos are some of my most cherished household items. In case you didn't already know, I can't give her enough praise and I know you would be lucky to have her photograph your wedding and you would be thrilled with the results.

We had the privilege of having Lori photograph our engagement session and then our wedding in September 2010. I interviewed 3 photographers and once I met Lori, I knew instantly sh...

e was the one I wanted to capture our big day! She is bubbly and full of fun ideas. I particularly love her style. She is very natural in her photography. Some photos are so over enhanced these days that you wonder how they will hold up in time. Lori is the complete opposite of that. She knows how to work with lighting and will capture that laugh, giggle, nudge when you least expect it. She will not pose you... So, I suggest you come with ideas on how you would like to stand and locations and be relaxed! My husband and I are very tense photo takers. Lori really broke down that wall. After our engagement session and wedding... I think my husband and I were ready for the runway, thanks to Lori. I have not ordered my album yet nor have I seen prints but from what I have on this very-techy hard drive she sent, the pictures are fantastic.
