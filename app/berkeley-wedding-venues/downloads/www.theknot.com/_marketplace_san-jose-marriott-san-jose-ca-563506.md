Exceeded expectations! The hotel reception staff and porters were so accommodating all weekend. Room block and private room at Arcadia for brunch were a great value for this mode...

rn, updated property. Private room at Arcadia was lovely and had easy access to the brunch buffet. These small things made our stay stress free and more enjoyable: \- Late check out for bride's family/wedding suite \- Front desk suggesting and selecting a room for Mother of the bride and bride (night before wedding) on the same floor as my room (MOH) was SUPER convenient. Made getting ready so much easier. \- Allowing MOH to pick up the wedding suite keys for the couple, and strawberries/bubbly for the wedding suite (the couple loved the gesture!) \- Front desk quickly coordinated storing many vases of flowers that we brought back late in the evening from the wedding for Sun brunch tables, giving us more time to enjoy drinks with guests at Tanq. Flawless communication from front desk to Sun brunch staff regarding decorating the brunch tables-they did a great job setting up the private room on Sun.

This review is to give credit to the San Jose Marriott and their care toward our wedding. My husband and I decided to host our wedding with the San Jose Marriott, not only for th...

eir layout but also for the competent and kindness of their entire staff. During our search for a venue, we came to realize that the quality we were looking for was not only determined for the beauty of a space but the team which would help assemble our wedding day. The Marriott team was not only bright but also extremely kind. We knew that their team would assist in executing the type of wedding we envisioned. Gigi was our first point of contact - she's incredibly detailed and understands the need of couples. Other than that, other factors that informed our decision was their wedding packages, which was complete with wine at dinner, an excellent outside wedding cake vendor and a complete cocktail hour. Their food is prepared and suggested by their kitchen staff at the world renowned Arcadia, where my wedding guests also dined, the night before and the morning after our wedding reception. Some of the highlights of my wedding weekend: The ease of our guests getting to the hotel and to our church (50% of our guest were from out of town) The support up until the wedding week from their staff on adjusting our guest reservations A trendy bar to host and entertain our guests the night before the wedding while we were away at the rehearsal dinner. We joined them on our return home and made it very easy to return to our rooms. A nice all inclusive, Sunday brunch of $25 at Arcadia. They also have multiple private rooms within this restaurant to reserve for your guest and to open gifts. Adjustments and request were accommodated with kindness by their staff throughout our collaboration with them Their decorations vendor was excellent (this is only an option if you would like a specific look) Overall, this choice was perfect for our wedding vision and accommodations for our guests. Gigi and her staff were simply amazing.

It was like one stop shopping -- the on site coordinator took the worry out of our planning.;The carpet was 'ugly' -- but once everything else was in place, you don't really notice
