The classic 1928 sailing vessel gracefully tours the waters of the San Francisco Bay while you and your partner swap vows and say, "I do."

Nothing compares to Electra. Every other place that we'd been to offered similar packages for food and beverages but it's how it's presented and perceived that makes a difference t...

o me. Our wedding was everything we hoped it would be, from the super friendly and professional team at Electra to the excellent food. We booked an extra hour in addition to the four hours and it was worth it. Our guests loved the yacht, a celebration on the bay, the delicious food, wedding toasts with the best views ever, and the whole experience.

Our wedding on Electra was amazing! First of all, this was a same-sex wedding and the captain and all of the crew were incredibly welcoming and accommodating. It had been challen...

ging to find a spot that felt intimate, yet special and unique, but at a somewhat reasonable price. As soon as we boarded the Electra we knew we had found it. The boat has a wonderful vintage vibe with beautiful mahogany detailing and multiple different spaces that allowed for varied gathering opportunities and excellent photo backgrounds. Our guests said it was the best wedding they've ever been to. Thank you Electra for making our dream wedding a reality!

I loved everything about our experience with Electra! I have nothing but great things to say...we would do it exactly the same way if we were to do it again. We were free to make ...

it as we wished but it couldn't have been easier. The location was beautiful, the food was amazing, the crew was outstanding, and everyone had a fantastic time. The interior of the boat was beautiful and of a different era, nothing like it out there. Highly recommend!
