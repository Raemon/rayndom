We had Brandon as our DJ and Emcee for our wedding this past July. We met with Brandon multiple times before our wedding to discuss the plan of action and how he would help bring o...

ur wedding day to life. Throughout the whole process Brandon was professional, organized, and on point. He had multiple insights and suggestions that made planning our music and itinerary for the wedding easier and he had easy to use handouts that made sure we were all on the same page with what he would be doing for us. On the day of the event, he was timely, enthusiastic, and flexible and created a warm and welcoming atmosphere with his music playing and emceeing abilities. We cannot thank Brandon enough for how he made our wedding day truly special. We highly recommend him to anyone looking for a DJ/Emcee for their wedding or special event.

We hired Brandon for our wedding, and it was the best choice we could have made. Working with Brandon was wonderful. He was on top of every aspect our weddings music, sound, photo...

booth, and lighting needs. After our initial sit down, he reached out to my wife and I once the wedding got closer to plan out everything that was going to need some kind of music or introduction. His forms were easy to fill out and edit as needed. We connected multiple times before the wedding to finalize all the timings. One thing I really appreciated is that he double even triple checked pronunciations of our wedding party's names so there was nothing left to chance. The sound and volume on everything was perfect and got complements from guests about how great our DJ was. He was great about feeling out the crowd to make sure they stayed on the dance floor and made sure to keep the party going. His photo booth was amazing, and we loved that we got a drive with a digital copy of all the photos taken that night. It was very special to see all the photos and see the fun our friends and family had. They went above and beyond and created a custom template for the photos that looked exactly like our save the dates and invitations. We would 100% recommend hiring Brandon and Enriquez Events for any event you might have. You will not be disappointed. We will definitely be using him again for our next big party! Thank you Brandon, for making our special day one to remember!

m when it came to music choices! His communication was excellent and he made me feel at ease knowing many of the important aspects of our wedding day were taken care of. Our dance floor was filled all night long, I still have yet to attend a wedding where more than half of the guests were on the dance floor all night long. I have guests that still come up to me reminiscing about that night and talk about how great of a DJ Brandon was. Could not recommend him enough!
