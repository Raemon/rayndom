designed the vision I had of the perfect fall wedding and Danielle executed it to perfection. They made the whole process easy and took away a lot of the stress that is talking to vendors and making sure all the details are taken care of. The day of the wedding I was able to fully relax and be present in the moment. Danielle took care of everything from setting up with all the vendors to ensuring the speeches were going when they were supposed to and ensuring everything was flawless. Hiring them made the day so perfect and the whole process enjoyable and stress free. All the communication was great and I always felt like a priority when speaking with them. They had a great team of vendors to choose from and were considerate of my budget. If you are considering a wedding in the Napa Valley and need a planner, I would highly recommend the team at Carly Saber Events!

tress jobs, but Carly made the entire planning process feel seamless, organized, and - most importantly - fun. She was incredibly thorough, thoughtful, and always several steps ahead, all while being an exceptional problem solver. About three days before our wedding, a fluke rainstorm popped onto the forecast- highly unusual for late April in Healdsburg! In record time, Carly secured a beautiful tent (even negotiating the price down to ease the budget pressure) and completely reimagined the layout and flow of our ceremony and reception to create the most magical rainy-day experience. She was extremely responsive, proactive, and calming during a time that could have easily been overwhelming without her steady support. Our wedding turned out to be more incredible than we ever could have imagined, and we owe so much of that to Carly. Beyond her talents as a planner, she’s simply a wonderful person to work with. Run, don’t walk, to hire her - you will be so grateful you did. We truly cannot recommend her highly enough!

We wholeheartedly recommend Carly Saber for any event or planning needs; she is simply the best!! From the moment we reached out to her, she transformed what initially felt like an...

overwhelming task into an enjoyable and exciting journey. Before contacting Carly, we were daunted at the prospect of planning our wedding and didn’t even know where to start. However, Carly’s warm demeanor and expertise instantly put us at ease. Carly worked closely with us, accommodating our busy schedules and making the planning process so much easier. Her ultimate flexibility and willingness to incorporate our ideas were truly commendable. She made wedding planning not just manageable, but genuinely fun, and her enthusiasm only heightened our excitement about getting married. What impressed us the most was her incredible organization and thorough knowledge of everything that needed to be done. When we were picking out venues, Carly made touring various different locations super easy by organizing site visits to make it easier for us travel through Napa Valley on a tight schedule. Carly is super responsive, often replying to our messages in the middle of the night or on weekends—even while she was on vacation or planning her own wedding! Her attention to detail was exceptional; she thought of everything when it came to our wedding, ensuring that all of our guests were taken care of and that every single detail was handled flawlessly. Carly provided us with fantastic vendor recommendations, ensuring that everything fit within our budget. We loved every single vendor she suggested, and we know that it all started with the best decision we made—hiring Carly! On our wedding day, Carly was always there to ease our nerves while also keeping us hyped and excited. We truly don’t know how we would have navigated our wedding day without her support and guidance. We would absolutely love to work with her again in the future for other events and recommend her to our closest friends and family. Thank you, Carly, for making our wedding planning experience unforgettable!

ntire experience they were professional, organized, timely, and so much fun to work with. Carly blew us away throughout the design process, and created an incredible design board that allowed us to seamlessly receive quotes from other vendors (florists, rentals, etc). All of CSE’s vendor recommendation were stellar, and all of the vendors we connected with were quick to let us know that they LOVED working with CSE. Danielle was our main planner and we could not have been happier with our experience. She created all of the important tools like our budget, vendor trackers, and monthly to-do list which made our wedding so organized. She made our planning experience so positive by taking care of everything, big and small! Not only did she exceed our expectations with her coordination and execution, but her positive attitude made the entire experience so JOYFUL. Whether it was the day of our wedding, or even just a quick phone call / email, Danielle approached each interaction with a smile and calm demeanor. We really appreciated how quickly she got back to me and took care of changes. She developed an incredible timeline for us, and completely took control of vendor communication/updates so that we could just enjoy the special time leading up to our wedding. Even our wedding party and guests commented on how lovely she was throughout our wedding day. We truly owe our entire wedding experience to the CSE team, and we are so sad that our time working with them has come to an end.

nication Coordination Design Organization Attitudes Communication - we planned our Napa Valley wedding 3,000 miles from home. Not only was Danielle responsive to all of our questions, but was proactive on sending me invoices, updates on vendors, and things I didn’t even think about goes into wedding planning Coordination - Danielle outlined our entire day to a T and it was perfect. We really wanted to spend as much time with our guests and they ensured our day accounted for that. They made it beyond easy to pick the right vendors for US, while providing top vendors in a variety of price ranges. Design - WOW did they nail our vision. We wanted our wedding to feel comfortable, elegant and a giant party. We asked for a disco ball dance floor, tequila shots as our seating chart, and endless food and they delivered and then some. Our family and friends kept saying how our wedding was epic and magical. Organization - As the Bride and Groom we were so at ease having Danielle at our side on our wedding day. We were able to enjoy our mornings with our families and close friends without any worrying of how our wedding setup is going. We were basically able to enjoy our wedding as a guest which made it so incredibly special to us. Attitudes - Danielle is the most amazing planner AND person! She and Carly made us immediately feel comfortable from our first conversation. They made it easy to chat through our concerns and had amazing suggestions. If you have the opportunity to work with Danielle, it’s a must! 1000/10 would recommend

ess, organization, and overall presence since Day 1, it felt like we hired her for full time planning! Danielle was not only a great resource throughout the planning process, keeping us on track with checklists, timelines, vendors and reminders, but she was truly a great friend throughout the entire time. I found myself bouncing the smallest things off her and she never once complained or made it seem like any question or topic was off limits. I felt so comfortable going into the big weekend knowing Danielle was by my side and on top of every detail we had worked so hard on planning for the months leading up. Her personality brightens any room and situation she walks into and her ability to remain calm and positive throughout the day really made a difference when I myself was on the verge of some meltdowns. Danielle and the entire team at Carly Saber are experts in the Napa area and have established great connections with the best vendors. We knew we were in good hands after our initial call, and it was comforting since my husband and I are both transplants to CA and nearly 95% of our guests were coming in from out of town! Danielle brought our vision to life, and we had the absolute perfect Napa wedding weekend with our loved ones. Thank you, Danielle, not only for your professionalism and expertise but your friendship throughout the process. I miss the planning process so much and a lot of that is due to how fun and seamless Danielle made it for us! Don’t think twice and hire Danielle from Carly Saber events!

ible. She made herself available to us whenever we had questions or needs come up. It truly felt like a full time planner experience at times. The day of the wedding, everything was executed so professionally and flawlessly. We had relatively large wedding parties and family and Danielle orchestrated so many moving parts & vendors so seamlessly. It was also very important to my husband & I that we were surrounded by positive & fun energy on our wedding day and Danielle continued to match what we were giving off! I could not recommend Danielle & The Carly Saber Events team more!

We are beyond grateful that we had the opportunity to work with Danielle- her expertise and connections in the Sonoma/California helped bring our wedding vision to life. It truly was even better than we imagined. We feel beyond grateful to the team for not just making this journey fun, but for helping the wedding day itself go as smoothly as possible. Carly & Danielle- we are feeling so lucky that we found you and were able to work on our dream day with you. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts!

erves it. From Day 1 of working together for our wedding, Carly has been responsive, supportive, flexible, and fun! She nailed the design for our wedding (seriously, every event and vibe were on point), she took things off of our plate when work was crazy and we didn’t have time to focus on the wedding, and she dealt with our crazy requests & ideas throughout the process. She executed both our welcome dinner and wedding flawlessly, and we hired her for our welcome dinner literally 1 week before the event because we needed help getting it over the finish line. We honestly couldn’t have done the wedding planning process without her and she is 100% the reason why our wedding weekend was so amazing, memorable, and stress-free. So TLDR is hire her!

Every question was answered promptly, our timeline was detailed and perfectly planned, she communicated with all of my vendors, and really allowed me to relax and focus on enjoying the lead up to our wedding day.

She helped with the set up, organized the vendors and deliveries, kept me in the loop on everything, and made sure we were sticking to our schedule. She is flexible, hyper organized, and just overall a joy to work with and be around. I would recommend her to any couple getting married. We can't stop talking about how flawlessly executed the wedding was, and we can attribute a lot of that to her! 10/10!!!

ng, Patricia's warm and professional demeanor put us at ease. As the bride, I felt completely supported and reassured by her expertise and attention to detail. Patricia's experience in the wedding industry is evident in every aspect of her work. She anticipated our needs before we even knew we had them, ensuring every detail was meticulously planned and executed. Her organization skills are top-notch, and she flawlessly managed all the moving parts of our wedding day. One of the most remarkable things about Patricia is her ability to make you feel genuinely cared for. She was always available to answer questions, provide guidance, and offer a calming presence during moments of stress. On the big day, I was able to fully enjoy the celebration because I knew Patricia had everything under control. Our wedding was a dream come true, and we owe a significant part of that to Patricia's hard work and dedication. If you're looking for a wedding coordinator who is not only highly skilled but also incredibly kind and supportive, Patricia is the one to choose. She made our special day absolutely perfect, and we are forever grateful for her. Thank you, Patricia, for making our wedding day an unforgettable experience!

She is organized, listens, she's trustworthy, and will do whatever you need in order to make your day the most special day it could possibly be. One thing that stood out to me most was on the actual day of the wedding. Carly took on any and all tasks even though they might not have been her own or were maybe more suited for the venue staff or other vendors. Everything went PERFECT and it was the most fun I have ever had. Everyone was raving about every aspect of the day and our families were especially thrilled with the work Carly did! Don't hesitate to work with Carly. I know good business and she does incredible business. She receives my highest of recommendations and she will not disappoint!

The guests couldn't stop talking about how flawlessly everything came together, and during dinner, I was almost breathless from the sheer beauty of it all. But what truly sets Carly apart is her unwavering dedication. She was there for us every step of the way, answering our questions day and night and handling unexpected challenges with grace and professionalism. She made me feel very heard and her reassuring presence made the entire experience feel stress-free, and we felt genuinely cared for.

We had an Indian wedding and a Jewish wedding in one day, which was a 14 hour wedding day! We used 2 locations within the same property and had 2 meals, 2 completely different setups and colors/design visions, and more vendors than a typical wedding. Carly handled everything flawlessly and was so on top of every detail. She was willing to hop on calls whenever we had questions, and she even took the time to join a call to meet my parents and answer all of their questions! The coordination services on the day of our wedding were impeccable. Carly and her team took care of everything and made sure the day ran smoothly, and we didn't have to worry about anything. I 100% recommend Carly! She is the BEST!
