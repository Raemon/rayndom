Jaime Sturgeon Zile

Owner

"Do what you love and love what you do!" I am so blessed to look forward to work everyday. When I'm not in the store you can find me at the gym dancing, playing tennis, or hanging with my favorite ladies. Mostly, my husband and I are on the sidelines cheering our son in Baseball and living vicariously through our daughter in college. We are both St. Mary's graduates (Go Gaels!) and love living in the Tri-Valley. A big shout out goes to my mom, dad, and sister for always lending a hand. A huge thank you to my mom for teaching me how to sew!

Shopping for my wedding dress here was such a special experience! Jaime was wonderful—so helpful and kind throughout the entire process. I brought all my girls with me, and we had ...

a great time. I booked my appointment about a year before the wedding, and the stylists were amazing. They even served champagne while I tried on dresses, which made the day feel even more celebratory. I ended up trying on about eight dresses and fell in love with the third one I tried! You can see in the photos how it looked from the first fitting all the way to the big day—it truly is a stunning dress. I received so many compliments! I recently brought it back to Jaime to have it preserved, and I’m so happy to keep it looking beautiful for years to come. Also, I used Janis Alterations (their seamstress) right behind the store for my wedding dress, rehearsal dinner and getting ready outfit. Janis is amazing! She really knows what looks best and is very detailed with her work.

t me dresses I might not have thought of. She was careful to let me know when one of my choices was over budget, and I never felt pressured to make a purchase. I did end up purchasing my dress at J'aime, and partly due to my great experience with my dress, I also returned for my veil and used their in house seamstress, Janis. That was another great experience! Janis is so talented and professional, as well as friendly and accommodating. Because of going through J'aime for my dress, veil, and fittings, I was there quite a few times! Each time I felt so welcomed, especially when the owner Jaime greeted me by name every time. I highly recommend any bride shopping for bridal attire to go to J'aime; I'm a little bummed to not be going there as frequently anymore!

After visiting 3 different stores in the East Bay Area, I finally found my wedding dress at J’aime Bridal!! I was exhausted by the end of the day, but the store associates were so ...

kind and energetic, and were extremely helpful in thinking through options and possibilities with me! In the end, I went with an a-line Maggie Sotero dress that happened to be a store sample — it fit me perfectly and was priced very reasonably. Janis, the in-house tailor, was also wonderful to work with — I needed only minor modifications, and Janis was both efficient and organized. Everything from my first fitting to my final fitting was super smooth, and they were even able to keep my dress until the wedding (and steam it just before!), which helped loads! If you’re searching for a wedding dress, J’aime Bridal is the perfect place to visit.

to choose from; I found a dress that I loved and can't wait to wear on my wedding day next year. The team at J'aime Bridal is experienced, helpful, and friendly -- not much more you could ask for there! Plus, Janis Stob, their in-house tailor, is extremely talented and efficient with alterations. I wish I had another dress to buy so that I could go back again!! For anyone seeking a wedding dress (or a bridesmaid dress), I'd highly recommend visiting J'aime Bridal! (and of course, I'll add photos of my dress after my wedding!) Plus, during this COVID time, they're going above and beyond to help brides find their wedding dresses -- it's really clear that they love what they do!

size bride I was so nervous how I was going to look in a wedding dress, but 10 minutes with the Jamie told me that this was my new home. I found my dress, they knew I had found it but didn't want to influence me because they wanted it to be authentically mine. WE ordered it in the right color and size with an additional lace package so I could add sleeves. It arrived so quickly I didn't know what to do! I went and tried it on and they were there for me when I had that magical moment of "this is my dress." After that it was a whirlwind! I set up my fittings with Janis Stob immediately. She helped me customize my sleeves perfectly! As a plus-size bride I don't like my arms, she made me look royal and comfortable! My sleeves were perfect, not itchy and I could raise my arms and dance the night away including our first choreo dance! My experience with her and the whole team is priceless and I would recommend them to anyone!

I found my dream dress at J’aime Bridal and my bridesmaids’ dresses. We had an amazing experience trying on dresses. I tried on my dress several times because I wanted my sisters, ...

mom, and mother-in-law to see the dress before I said yes to the dress. They couldn’t come on the same day and they were so accommodating. They are very responsive to phone calls, texts, and emails. My veil was delayed in being shipped and I had already scheduled my HMU trial. They were so kind and let me borrow the store’s veil for my HMU trial. I also loved the continuity of working with Jaime the entire way. It was also awesome that if you purchase your wedding gown there, you get a discount on bridesmaid dresses. Jaime was so helpful in trying to find the perfect combination of shades of purple for my bridesmaid dresses. Two of my bridesmaids were not local and they helped them do measurements over the phone. Five out of six of my bridesmaids had a perfect fit to their dress. For some reason, my sister’s dress was way too big and was difficult to alter even though she got measured at J’aime. I think that was just a fluke though because all of the other dresses were sized appropriately. Their seamstress, Janis at December’s Child, was wonderful! She was fun and easy-to-work with. She was sweet and made my garter from the extra fabric from my dress that we took off when we hemmed the dress. She made the alterations process stress-free. She had my dress ready to go well in advance of my wedding. Everyone associated with J’aime Bridal is so friendly. I am so thankful to the whole team!

I found THE dress here! Before coming here, I had gone to maybe 5-6 different bridal boutiques (from Pleasanton to San Francisco to San Jose) and felt like none of the 80 dresses...

that I tried on was THE dress. I told myself that J'aime Bridal was the last place I would look before deciding. They had just received new 2019 Essense dresses (my favorite designer) on display so I was in luck! I actually couldn't decide between 2 different dresses that I found here! Finally decided on D2587 :) Thank you so much for your patience and great service!

I had an appointment with Kylie to pick out my wedding dress! It was my first time wedding dress shopping and I'd actually gone to J'amie Bridal before for a few bridesmaids dresse...

s from previous weddings I had been in and already knew their customer service was wonderful! Kylie did a great job of listening to what I had to say about what I'd looked at, and an even better job of making sure to pick out things that weren't necessarily in my binder (yes, I was that bride) which ultimately looked even better than dresses I could've picked out myself! I ended up canceling my next location's appointment because I fell in love with a BEAUTIFUL Essence gown that was still almost brand new to the shop (brownie points to Kylie for getting me into a dress I haven't already seen on a million other brides)! My wedding is fairly soon, so she was even able to find my size in stock to be shipped in ONE MONTH instead of the usual six! I already cannot wait to go back there with my bridesmaids to find their perfect dresses! (Also...huge thank you to the whole staff who was so friendly towards my sister/MOH's one year old son! It made all of us feel so welcomed!)

J'aime Bridal is the best bridal experience you can have. I found a dress at a bridal fair that I fell in love with, but I needed to have my mom with me when I chose my dress. So I...

called around the bay area trying to find a store that carried it. J'aime Bridal was listed as one, but didn't have it in stock. So they above and beyond and ordered a brand new sample dress in my size. We rescheduled for when they would have it, so I could try it on again. When I came for my appointment they hadn't let anyone try it on, and of course I loved it so they let me buy the brand new sample dress. Their customer service is phenomenal, and I would recommend them to everyone. My dress was a Maggie Sottero - Veda. And my wedding was on Feb 16th, 2019 at the venue: OVY Camp in San Gregorio, CA.

I visited J'aime Bridal in downtown Pleasanton one of my bride-to-be friends to look at dresses at just before the first of the year and the experience was nothing short of amazing...

. Jamie (the owner) took such good care of us! We came back two days later for my friends appointment to try on gowns and we had the pleasure of working with the other Jamie (stylist) and our experience was amazing the second time as well. (My friend, bride-to-be, was so happy with her experience here too.) The ladies that work here are so sweet and accommodating. As a wedding vendor and a past bride myself - I would highly, highly recommend J'aime Bridal to anyone who is looking for their perfect wedding dress. I could not believe how many options and different gowns in so many different styles they had to offer and at great price points. Again, highly recommended. I cannot say enough wonderful things about this shop.

Best bridal salon hands down. I had visited multiple times prior to my purchase and never felt like I was bothering anyone. I had gone to the chain store to “save money” and just w...

asn’t finding the one. Made an appointment for that same day (4th visit with J’aime) and tried on a few old favorites and they weren’t working anymore. The owner was my stylist and she started pulling dresses I originally said I didn’t want and low and behold, I found the dress with the second one she picked for me. I’m so happy with the one I picked and I never would’ve even thought to try it. I’ve called a few times asking questions and my girls have come in to browse and every time I feel like they care about my wedding as if I’m the only bride they’re helping. I love the girls working here and the owner is a complete angel. I can’t wait for my dress to come in and get all my accessories and extras.

Last night I got sucked into an Instagram blackhole of wedding photographers and venue pages, dress makers and flower shops, following hashtag to hashtag to new profile and company...

to check out. On one obscure post in the frenzy I saw a bride thanking J'aime Bridal for the alterations they had done, and when I looked at the Jaime Bridal page itself I was surprised to see they were only an hour and a half away. The website made it extremely easy to book an appointment and I figured why not jump in and try on some dresses. I went in knowing nothing, no shape or texture or idea of what I wanted and Kylie helped me throughout the entire experience with so much laughter it made the process easy. Before I knew it I found my gown, the most important dress of my lifetime, and I was being rung up. For a process I’ve had so much anxiety about it was actually so easy, I expected to need a million appointments and stores before I could make a decision. I’m so thankful I was able to do this today, to everyone in my life who made it possible to be doing this at all, and I can’t wait to actually show you my dress when I marry Mio!!

ft J'aime's bridal today with my daughter scared and almost in tears after the owner went off on me because I asked the associate if I could talk to the owner about the alteration charge. Keep in mind, these dresses were sent back due to an error from the manufacture. They did the right thing and reordered. However, the second set of dresses didn't fit either. She (the owner) assured me she would fix whatever needed to be fixed, even if she had to do it herself as she was a seamstress. I had a nice conversation with her last time, so it was quite a surprise when I was told I was going to be charged for the additional alterations. I never yelled or demanded for them to cover the cost, I was just inquiring. The owner went right into attack mode saying it was not their fault, that I WAS going to pay for the alteration and I have been rude to her employees. I was glad that I've had people who have gone with me who can attest that although I was frustrated with the dresses, I was not rude to the employees. And certainly if they can't take frustration they should not be in the bridal business. I finally told her to walk away from me immediately as I could see my daughter was frightened and I was getting angrier. She should have asked to talk to me privately and should have NEVER attacked me the way she did in front of my 8 year old who was so scared. There is never a justification for that!

Dear Janice - I wish you best with the wedding. The dresses that the bride picked out for...

your 2 girls are gorgeous and the dresses fit beautifully. It was best to do the alterations last minute for a perfect fit (which my seamstress did in 2 days). I'm sorry you thought the alterations were included ($35), but it's not fair to my seamstress to work on the dress and not be compensated for it. Had we gone up a size the dresses would have been too big and they would have been altered down. We even had the dresses steamed out for you prior to your arrival.

This experience was the worst experience I’ve had at a bridal salon so far. :( I have been to a couple bridal salons in Colorado, that’s where I’m from. This was the first bridal s...

alon that I have been to in California and it was so disappointing. When I made the appointment the lady that I met with wasn’t very nice and wasn’t welcoming at all, when I tried to show her pictures of the types of dresses that I wanted she didn’t really respond at all she just was like OK. I ended up looking through the rack of dresses myself and choosing them, however the dresses looked very worn and dirty. The environment was kind of cluttered and it was kind of dirty in there. I picked some of the dresses that I liked, I had shown her some of the pictures of the dresses of Maggie Sotterro that I had seen online, however she did not have any of them and said that they were new releases. However, it’s already halfway through the year and they had no new dresses from 2018. When I was trying dresses on, I was just wearing underwear. I usually don’t wear a bra to these fittings because you know, they’re women so it’s not usually a big deal and the dresses usually have bras built in. However this lady made me feel so awkward, I wanted to die. Not only was I naked, she was making me feel awkward and like staring at me, I had picked out some ball gown dresses and instead of helping me by putting on the dresses by going over my head as other salons do, she was just taking the dresses and setting them on the ground and saying oh you can slip this on yourself and then walking away, so I was standing there struggling, sweating to get into these gigantic dresses all by myself and she didnt help me even though I was obviously struggling. It was the most awkward experience ever! The dresses were nothing special, they were dirty and some of them were torn, they looked almost gray, not white. After awkwardly getting into the dresses that I sort of liked, all by myself, the lady had no suggestions as to anything else that would look good. Also I am not a very big girl. I am about a size 8 to 10 in wedding dresses which is about a size 4 in normal clothes; however, I do have hips (like a normal woman). When I tried formfitting dresses they were very small over my hips which is not usual, and when I tried to squeeze into one by myself, I was like is there a way you know we could like clip this here or something? And she was like nope that doesn’t fit and then she just took all the dresses that were fitted that I actually liked in the same brand and just put all of them back without letting me even look at them. She made me feel so fat and it was so sad and it was the most awkward experience of my life. I never leave bad reviews so this is a first. If you want a calm beautiful setting with beautiful dresses, and a nice lady to help you put the gigantic Gallons on, do not come here!

Response from J'aime Bridal on 07/21/2018

Hi Olivia - We tried to reach out via the phone number and email you used to book your app...

ointment - however the number had been disconnected and you haven't returned our emails. I'd love to chat more with you about your appointment. For those reading.... I always read reviews to see what we can do better. Even after being in business for 15 years, I am still always learning and improving. However the concerns this bride has me puzzled because my store has been built to be the exact opposite of what she writes. As far as the store being dirty, we have a weekly cleaning service to keep the store clean, especially the floors to cut down on dust on the hem of the dresses. We are a Premier retailer for Maggie Sottero which means we sell the most in the area and always receive our samples before other bridal boutiques in the area. Maggie Sottero has 2 seasons every year. The first set of dresses ship between January and April and the second set between June and August. The dresses you were asking about are from the new Fall 2018 line. If you follow our social media you will see that we have received about 60 new dresses in the store over the past few weeks. We have already received the Spring 2018 dresses in the store. As for some of the worn dresses - most of those have been replaced and I actually take it as a compliment because those "dirty" dresses have been our best sellers and have paid my mortgage. :) As for you feeling uncomfortable with my consultant..... I got nothing. She's worked for me for 6 years and any bride is extremely lucky to have her as a consultant. She is the best employee any store could ever hope for and deserves to be paid 10x for the effort and love she puts into her job. I do believe that the customer is always right, but I also have to defend my hard working employees as well.
