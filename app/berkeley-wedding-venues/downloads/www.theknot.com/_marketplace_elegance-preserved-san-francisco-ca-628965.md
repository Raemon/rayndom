aning and preserving both my gown (Essense of Australia, Style D3314) and veil! I live along their regular route so it was very easy to schedule pickup and delivery of my items. They sent an itemized quote within 48hrs of pickup and ask for 50% down at the start of the process. My dress went to them at the end of June and was completed at the end of October. I would recommend their services to other recent brides!

en to in the SF Bay Area told me Elegance Preserved is the place to go to if you want your cleaning and preservation done right. I purchased my dress second-hand, and while it was cleaned before I had it altered by another vendor in the Bay Area, Elegance Preserved did a much better job removing stains that I thought were set from previous wear. I was recommended Elengance Preserved by both friends in the area, as well as the place that altered my dress, Le Caprice. The turnaround time was incredibly fast (some of my friends found that their dress from other cleaners took almost a year to get back!), and I loved the complimentary pick-up and drop-off service. There was some dirt staining on the bottom layers of my dress, as well as a piece of gum stuck to the bottom, and it all came out beautifully! I loved that Elegance Preserved provided a virtual showing of my dress after the cleaning was complete. They also cleaned and preserved my veil and borlero (jacket). All and all, I am super happy with my experience with Elegance Preserved.

ation through text was so easy. I bought my dress from Elegant Lace bridal. It had lots of glitter and was scared that it would be removed after washing it. But Olivia made sure to walk me through my concerns over the glitter before booking with them. The dress still has that glitter shine even after cleaning it! I found elegance preserved on Google. I looked at many places but for the price and quality, this was the best choice!

preserve the quality of this gown so that I can pass it down to my daughter, if she wants to wear it. To me, the cost is worth it to know that my dress is safely stored and preserved and won't age rapidly/degrade over time. The process also could not have been simpler--they make it easy to schedule a pick-up and drop-off in your neighborhood so you don't even have to pack/drag your dress off to a separate location.

The process was extremely convenient with free pickup/delivery, and they worked with me to put together a service that met my budget and cleaning expectations.

I did find two areas that were missed along the dirty hemline, but they quickly resolved this by picking up my dress again and re-cleaning and re-delivering it within 2 weeks. Highly recommend to save yourself any concerns you have with fragile dresses and sentimental items!

All of this was true, and more. Their team comes to pick up your dress for inspection with no pressure to use their services, and will work with you to make sure you are getting exactly what you need. The box it comes in has been packaged with so much thought, including gloves for handling the newly cleaned dress. I am truly so grateful to Elegance for helping me preserve this dress, which holds so many memories, and is something I hope to hang on to for a lifetime.

Y'all. I spilled an espresso martini down the front of my dress and Elegance preserved got it out!! I wore the Mercer dress from Lela Rose. The dress is made from a fabric that has...

tiny flowers woven into it. I was really worried that either my dress would be forever covered in brown espresso spots or that the flowers would get damaged in the process of getting the stain out - but miraculously, Elegance Preserved was able to get everything out and my dress is PRISTINE. I also sent them my Danielle Frankel veil which has a grossgrain ribbon edge. I got married on a cliff side, so this veil had literally been drug through dirt. They were able to get the dirt out of the veil and were super communicative about what was and was not possible for repairs. There is a single, tiny, pen sized dot that they couldn't get out of the veil. Olivia and the team were so kind and thoughtful and explained that they could keep trying and likely get the dot out, but doing so would risk the integrity of the ribbon edge. I loved working with them! I highly recommend Elegance Preserved for any brides looking to repair or preserve your dress. The process was so easy - they picked up and delivered my dress from my front door!

Everyone I worked with made the process so easy, and the end result is incredible. The bottom of my dress was so dirty after the wedding, particularly since we got married right after it rained so the ground was muddy and there were still some puddles!

It’s hard to get good pictures of such a long and ornate dress at home, so it’s really helpful to have their more professional pictures to help market my dress better on the resale market. It’s saved me a lot of time and trouble for sure and I’ve already recommended them to other recent bride friends!

d they got everything out! I was worried because I hadn't even thought about what to do with my dress after our wedding, and let it sit for about a month before I found Elegance Preserved. I am thankful I found them through some Googling and seeing positive reviews of other Janene's brides using their services. I wanted to make sure I gave my beautiful dress to an expert in wedding dress cleaning! Would definitely recommend their services. It was nice that they come to pick up the dress and hand deliver it back, so easy!

nt ripped from my heel stepping on it. Although small, I searched for the best of the best to help with my beloved dress. I reached out to Elegance Preserved and their amazing team for assistance. Their site offered clear directions on how the steps needed to get a quote. Within an hour of filing out my order form, Olivia scheduled me for the next route in my area and offered a timeframe of expectance. Once my driver Brittany arrived, she anwsered any of my additional questions and put me to ease! The handoff of my dress was easy and took less that 5 minutes in all! After a few days I recieved my quote for a cleaning and preservation, plus word of the additional tears the found during the examination process (one’s I hadn’t even seen!). I was sent photos of the damage before approving my fair repair quote and given an honest opinion of the out come. Fast forward just a few weeks and my dress is complete and ready for delivery! Returned back to me as easily as it was picked up, was my beautiful dress looking as stunning as it did the day I brought it home from the shop. I cannot stop recommending Elegance to any and all of my girlfriends after their big day. Customer service and quality of service is 10/10! Thank you Elegance Preserved team for everything.

t them know what date works best for you to do this. You can also select if you want your dress only cleaned or also preserved. Communication with them was excellent from start to finish, and the end product looked great. Their work looks very professionally done, well-packed with protective tissue and even white gloves to inspect it! I highly recommend this company as they do great work, and they made drop off/delivery so hassle-free.

I live in a major city and had a surprisingly difficult time finding a dry cleaner who would take my dress (and clean it at a reasonable price), so after lots of calling around I d...

ecided to use Elegance Preserved as they were the recommended dry cleaner from my wedding dress designer, Sarah Seven. They are located in San Francisco so this required having the dress shipped there and back but it honestly turned out easier and more stress free than using any local cleaner! I simply emailed them some photos of the dress, and they provided a quote in a timely manner. Then they sent me a FedEx box with a prepaid shipping label and I shipped my gown off to them! It took about 2 months for them to do the cleaning, but I just received it back today and it looks good as new! I had a lot of dirt staining on the bottom of the gown from having an outdoor wedding, and you would never know that by looking at the dress post-cleaning. My dress also has pearl appliqués all over and they did a great job in keeping them all intact. I also really appreciated the customer service - the ladies were extremely communicative and kept me informed throughout the whole process. I would recommend EP to anyone, regardless of if you live in the SF area or not because this was a seriously easy process.

As the mother of the bride, I interfaced frequently with Elegance Preserved to have my daughter's wedding dress cleaned (first Covid wedding) and cleaned/preserved (real wedding). ...

I dealt primarily with Kate and Olivia. My daughter's dress was a satin Eddy K dress, which needed quite a bit of cleaning. Janene's Bridal in Alameda recommended Elegance Preserved and we couldn't be happier. The customer service is absolutely flawless. I have rarely had an experience so pleasant and so efficient. Elegance Preserved picked up and then delivered her dress twice. All spots were removed and the dress looked like new when it was finished. Their work is perfection and the people at Elegance were incredibly informative and responsive. I highly recommend Elegance Preserved. You will not be disappointed!

livia who helped me along the way. She was responsive and professional. She also shared honest feedbacks. After testing my dress for restoration, she informed me that stains on the dress and discoloration would come off because of the age and silk material of the dress, and might be better off getting the top layer replaced, rather than getting it restored. This gave me an impression that they (as a business) are look out their customers best interests, even if that might mean no business for them. I ended up getting my dress cleaned and am really happy with the overall service I received.

had a Mori Lee dress that had a lot of lace and a train), but it is well worth the cost to me. I would've been devastated if I had let my dress sit in the closet and get dirty and yellow. It's now preserved as a forever memory of the happiest day of my life! The Elegance Preserved team has excellent customer service. Because I live in the North Bay, I met at a point half way to drop my dress off. I received an email notification when my dress arrived at their shop. It took about 10-11 weeks to get it cleaned and preserved. When my dress was finished, they couriered and hand delivered my dress (in the rain!!). They maintained excellent communication and professionalism throughout the process. I highly recommend Elegance Preserved if you are looking to preserve your wedding dress. You won't regret it!

I have never had a business go above and beyond for me like Elegance Preserved did. I got married in August and immediately after my wedding, I moved to Florida to join my husband....

I left my dress behind with my mother in California as I knew I wanted my dress to be preserved by Elegance Preserved as they had amazing reviews everywhere. They were super kind and were able to pick up my Sophia Tolli (the Clarissa gown) from my mom’s house all while communicating with me. Within three months, they carefully cleaned and restored all of the layers of lace. They completely fixed the small tears and removed stubborn stains like stains from the asphalt from the down and my cathedral-style veil. They essentially restored the dress to new conditions. They were so kind to offer free delivery to my mom’s house. When she received it, it came in a nicely sealed box equipped with gloves to inspect the dress. I am so happy with their services and their prices are so incredibly reasonable for all that they do. I’m so grateful to have found this business.

is to happen to my new daughter in law. I offered to have her gorgeous French lace, Innes di santo gown that she purchased at The Bridal Galleria in San Francisco, cleaned and preserved for her. Since it was an outdoor wedding the hemline was heavily soiled and had dried grass stuck in the delicate under skirting. Luckily, I found Elegance Preserved on the internet. From the beginning until delivering the beautifully cleaned and restored wedding gown they were helpful and professional. I later found out that the Bridal Galleria also highly recommends Elegance Preserved and included a very nice discount to their brides. This was an added bonus to the outstanding service I received.

I had a ton of anxiety about my dress because the more time I spent looking at it, the more I noticed spots and issues with it. With only 72 hours between when my seamstress was done and when I was meant to be married, Elegance preserved went above and beyond to make sure my wedding dress was perfect. They picked up my dress directly from the seamstress and delivered it to my home in the east bay - the day before my wedding. They sent me regular updates via text and phone and at 10 confirmed they got all the stains out. I cried tears of joy!!

about who i should use since it was for such a special day. I could not afford any horror stories. I did alot of research on bridal dress cleaning services and saw the great reviews on many websites for Elegance Preserved so i gave them a call to ask them questions about the cleaning process and services. My first call was with Sean, who was very helpful and answered all my questions and concerns. I received a ballpark price of around $200. After speaking to him I felt confident that they would be able to clean the dress properly. One week later i made an appointment with Olivia who came to pick up my dress at my home. We examined the dress together so i could point out all the dirty spots and she told me that she the cleaning professionals would take a look at the dress and give me my final price judging on how much work the dress would need. Olivia was fantastic, she helped me navigate payment since i could not do it online and had great follow and had some tips for finding buttons that i needed to replace.The final cost of cleaning the wedding dress was $220 but they were able to get all the dirty spots off the dress. I will definitely use them again after the wedding to preserve the dress.
