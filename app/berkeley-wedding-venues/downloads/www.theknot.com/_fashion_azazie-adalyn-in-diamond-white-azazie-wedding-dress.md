Description

The Adalyn bridal gown is a regal ball gown with a structured mikado bodice and a scoop neckline. It features a lace-up corset back finished with a self-tie bow, along with tulle off-the-shoulder draped sleeves and removable spaghetti straps for added versatility. The full, heavily pleated tulle skirt flows into a graceful court-length train, creating a romantic and dramatic silhouette.
