RJB was absolutely phenomenal and made our wedding reception into the most fun one we've ever been to. And although we may be biased, our friends grooving all night and busting out...

dance moves that no one has seen before is a testament to this. There was never a lull or boring moment, and the unique riffs and loops the band improv-ed to keep spontaneous dance moments going strong was so fun. They really listened to us, and communicated not just during the prep phase, but in real time to ensure we were intentional with all key moments. The band also welcomed my husband to join them for a few songs on his trumpet, and supported him through every note. Our friends and family were blown away by the surprise performance!!! We expected some good music but ended up with the fun cornerstone of our entire night! We couldn't recommend RJB enough 🔥

I was also very impressed by how they got the whole crowd dancing, despite our request for no vocalists---knowing my dance-averse friends, that was no easy feat for the band! We really appreciated having RJB as our wedding band; it made for such a special day.

We loved the wide repertoire they played, there was something for everyone. All our guests were raving about the band. I cannot speak highly enough of them. They were fantastic in every way.

contacted them until the moment the evening was over. We threw a lot of curveballs at them, from a surprise tap dance to a flash mob. To our total surprise, our flash mob recorded song ("I Think I Wanna Marry You" by Bruno Mars) cut out and when we couldn't get the sound back on, Retro Jukebox just picked up the song and played it live!!!!! It was infinitely better than we could have planned or even dreamed of. Wow wow wow. They played all our favorites based on the list we shared with them beforehand. The guests were raving about how talented the band was. They got everyone dancing and kept the energy high all night long. And it was a long night!

huge gift to our wedding day. Not only did Geechi and his fellow musicians create an unforgettable dance floor experience, they also made our dream vision come to life by taking their instruments in hand and creating a beautiful second line procession from our ceremony site to the cocktail hour. Geechi somehow managed to interweave playing a tuba and a trumpet in the same song for this procession! We will always remember the love and soulful vibes that RJB brought to our day. We cannot recommend them enough and hope to have a reason to work with them in the future. -Rachel and Oliver Miller

In the lead-up to the wedding, the band was easy to work with and accommodating in terms of learning requests. We had them play mostly Motown, funk and some contemporary hits but, based on their set list, they can also cover other genres with ease.

We had not booked a band until the very last weekend before the wedding. Acting on a recommendation from the venue (Monarch Cove, Capitola), I contacted RetroJukebox. This band...

had as many as eight , but they can have as few as three or four, depending on the need. We had a quartet consisting of piano, stand-up bass, drums and a vocalist. The vocalist was charming, cool and smooth. With Iittle time for planning and rehearsing, they played all of the most important wedding songs and, in between, they played the coolest instrumental Jazz...just perfect for a mellow day at the beach. The vocalist, John, made sure that my daughter and son in law had all traditional songs, which made them happy. I also received many compliments on the band from the guests. Call Geechi , the-band manager and one of the lead vocalists . They are from Berkeley, Oakland and SF. I do not hesitate at all in giving them the highest rating!

We hired Retro Jukebox Band for our wedding in Marin for about 150 guests, and it was one of the best decisions we made throughout the whole process. They provided a sound setup fo...

r the ceremony, live cocktail music, and live reception dance music. From the beginning, Nicole (the band manager) was easy and pleasant to work with. She answered our questions promptly and was able to work with us on a number of logistics about where, when, and what services would be provided. For our reception, the band had our guests dancing and rocking all night. We started with some 'timeless' motown hits that every generation could enjoy, and moved towards more top-40 hits later in the evening. Geechi, the band leader and MC, is truly exceptional and has great charisma and crowd instincts. Our dance floor was hopping. At the end of the evening, everyone was having such a blast that they were requesting an encore even after the event officially ended. Despite not being able to use amplification since it was "after hours" for the venue, Geechi improvised and led the crowd in singing a personalized "unplugged" version of Stand By Me which my partner and I will remember forever. It was the perfect end to the evening and a great testament to their ability to adapt to many circumstances and help a crowd have fun. Thank you Retro Jukebox Band for making our once-in-a-lifetime event so memorable.

Retro JukeBox Band was an incredible part of our wedding and I couldn't recommend them more highly. Geechi, Nicole and the team really went the extra mile to make our day special. ...

They worked with us in advance to understand our needs, made great suggestions on songs and background music, and then absolutely rocked the day-of. In particular they helped us find extra musicians to do a New Orleans style 2nd-line entrance for the groom which was a huge hit. They also made an effort to include Indian-influenced music and rhythms, which most bands cannot do on the fly. Geechi was an excellent MC during our wedding day, with exactly the right amount of talking, while still keeping us on time. In terms of actual music they were killers - they have a huge range of styles and fulfilled our request for a dance-heavy funk, R&B, and pop collection for our dance floor. I've never seen my dad dance so much, and I give most of the credit to Geechi and the band. I couldn't recommend them more highly - they are true professionals.

Geechi, the band leader, has great charisma which attracted us in the first place. He gets everyone involved and very engaged with the audience. Even during the wedding day, he came to us just to make sure that we were all on the same page. We love this band! However, we had a little problem with communications in the beginning of the process, but once Geechi took over the handling of this, he was pretty much on top of things and we really do appreciate that! We would totally recommend them for your next event!

To everyone (especially fathers of the bride) planning a wedding please heed my advice here. There are three core requirements in selecting a band for a wedding. Our daughter was...

married just this past Saturday (our first) and we had Geechi and the Retro Jukebox band play at the event. It was a stunning, over the top success and the Jukebox team was at the core of it! I've been to million dollar weddings and have to say this one was as fun and intimate as anything I've seen. This was an especially challenging affair for a band. It was an outdoor venue in Capitola overlooking the Monterrey Bay at the Monarch Cove Inn. We wanted the beach/bluff front venue as our first priority, but the venue doesn't allow amplification, and you've got the breeze, trees and the sea as background sound effects. Anyone that knows music, knows it takes real talent to sound great without amplification in an open air environment. It was an awesome affair and the band was great. There were three keys to the successful outcome with regard to the musical requirements of a wedding. 1\. Sound: The band has to be great. These guys were great. Without amplification we had the place jumping with killer R&B, Jazz & Rock and Roll. The dance floor was a crowded ball of fun that included the entire cross section of attendance from the dance lovers to the wall flowers. The energy of that dance floor was like a black hole sucking everyone to it's core. 2\. Timing & Organization: Don't overlook this. Your band is a key part of the synchronization of events that make an event magical. It's the hiccups and odd pauses that detract from an event. Geechi and I synched up; he gets it and has deep experience to draw on. I poke my head out my daughters threshold to look out at the crowd and instantly see Geechi's attentive gaze. I give him the thumbs up and he cues the band. Keeping eye contact throughout the processional, stepping to the beat with Geechi's head bobbing to each step; we are in-synch, en fuego. All through the event he's making sure we are in-synch and we are shooting cues back and forth. We didn't need a wedding planner; just a great band/event leader/MC and a father of the bride that knows what kind of a party he wants. 3\. Charisma: Geechi's got charisma. A great band without a charismatic leader can do just fine at many venues, but not at a wedding. When you've got the ceremony, the introductions, speeches, cake ceremony, etc, you need someone to bring the energy and charisma to each new segue of the event. To all you fathers out there, heed my advice. You need these three things above and I can say the Retro Jukebox band has these ingredients in abundance. I had so much fun and I will have this band again if I am ever so fortunate to host another even like this. If I could give 6 stars to this band I would.

Retro JukeBox Band was amazing! Definitely one of the best decisions we made for our wedding! For me, having a live band was one of the things I wanted most for our reception. I wa...

s very impressed by RJB's demos, but I was totally blown away by their live performance. We worked with Geechi to set up the reception and he was relaxed enough that it helped us relax as well. Feeling relaxed was an added bonus, and if you're planning a wedding you'll know what a luxury that is! We worked with RJB in a few ways: a smaller group played jazz during our cocktail hour (we loved it!), then Geechi emceed our introductions masterfully (not an easy job when your family is a mix of difficult Greek, Indian, and Filipino names...), and then the RJB septet brought the house down during our reception. We asked for a few specific songs, which they played beautifully. Geechi told us they usually just read the crowd and then go with it - and that's what they did. Everyone told us that the band was unbelievable. EVERYONE was dancing. We didn't want the party to end! If you're looking for a band that's going to blow you and your guests away, that is a great value, and that is going to actually help you relax during the stressful months of wedding planning, DEFINITELY hire Retro JukeBox Band. They were the best and I'd love to work with them again (and also be friends with them)!

Choosing Retro Jukebox Band for our wedding was without a doubt one of the best decisions we made. The guests had a blast, we had a blast, and the party just kept going and going....

Geechi is a joy to work with -- super responsive and accommodating, and just a phenomenal talent. The band can play anything, and will get everyone on their feet and having a great time. The best!
