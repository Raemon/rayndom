We could not have chosen a better venue and team. The team here is so passionate and genuinely kind, it shows in every encounter/conversation that you have. They are true experts i...

n weddings and they will do everything in their power to make everything go smoothly. My husband and I got married on Sunday, 6/8/2025 at 6pm. As soon as we officially booked, we were given a binder that was well-organized and it outlined details/questions that we would need to think about throughout the planning process.This binder was the blueprint that we followed for our 3 meetings with Tamica, the wonderful event expert and our day-of-coordinator. The meetings were thorough and helped ease concerns/fears that we had. Tamica was so great at reassuring us every step of the way. Her confidence in herself and her team provided a lot of comfort for us. A lot of our friends/family would check in and ask how stressed we are, and I would wonder if something was wrong with me because I didn’t feel that stressed at all. The all-inclusive package and their years of experience, really put us at ease and removed a lot of the stress/burden from us. We strongly encourage all potential brides & grooms to attend the fair that they hold bi-annually(?). This is a great opportunity to see the ceremony & reception layout, try the food, drinks, desserts/cake, meet DJ Scott, and see table/floral mock-ups. This was very helpful for how we wanted our decor and tables set up. The following are the details we went with. Package: Premier Tier for 80 guests Upgrades/additions: Photobooth, Prime Rib, elite chairs, round linens, napkins, 3 lawn games, tater tot bar, bistro lighting, charger plates, additional entree. Florals with Little Blue Hummingbird. Annie was so amazing. We had two meetings with her to discuss what we wanted. Bridal/bridesmaids bouquet, centerpieces, ceremony arch florals, cake florals and sweetheart table florals were stunning. Our guests loved them all and were so excited they got to take them home at the end of the night. She brought the vision to life and I was so obsessed with all of the arrangements. Cake and cake bites with Whisk’d Away. Mandy & Stephanie were lovely to work with. The tastings of three different flavors/combos were my favorite and fun to do. We chose a lavender cake with vanilla buttercream. Our guests LOVED it and could not stop raving about how delicious it was. The design was exactly what we wanted. We ordered some vegan cake bites that were the same flavor as our wedding cake as well and they were made/presented so cute. We are so excited to receive our complimentary 6” cake on our one year anniversary. DJ Scott as our MC/DJ. We had one meeting with him to discuss the details of our timeline/song choices and wedding style. He was quick to grasp our version of wedding games- Squid Games and was excited about it. He was quick to respond as there were several Emails as well. On the wedding day, everything was perfectly executed. He was so much fun and kept the energy and vibes up. Chef CJ makes magic in the kitchen. We are still hearing our friends & family rave about the food that they had (even the pickiest eaters). The appetizers, salads, entrees, and sides were phenomenal. Jonathan & I couldn’t eat much on the day but even our leftovers were delicious. Omar was our amazing bartender. Our guests complimented how amazing he was. We had two signature His & Her cocktails and he made sure we had a drink at all times.

My bride and I looked at several venues, including other Wedgewood venues, before deciding that Rio Hondo, Downey was where we wanted to get married. The landscaping and the lobby...

of the venue was what stood out to us immediately. The lobby looked contemporary with multiple levels and a coffered wood paneled ceiling. The landscaping, you need to be aware that this is an operating golf course. This could be an issue for some couples, but it wasn't for us. There is a large low rock waterfall in the distance, but depending on the timing you might not be able to take photos there. The ballroom is contemporary as well with a full wall of windows looking out on the ceremony space which in turn looks out on the golf course. An interesting point about the spaces, they are ornate enough to stand on their own, but are done in such a fashion that it won't strongly compete with more aggressive wedding designs. The exterior spaces are well maintained with a lot of foliage (it is a golf course), stone wall facades, and garden walls. This allowed our photographer a lot to work with for backgrounds. The back, side yards, the frontage, even the parking walkways were well landscaped. We did do the tasting ahead of time. This doubled as a wedding preview so you can see the various packages, center pieces, table settings, dessert options, and perhaps most important, a visual gauge for actual guest count/occupancy. Again, as an interesting point, the food at our wedding seemed to be better than what was offered at the tasting. They had some truly spectacular centerpieces, four-foot towering pieces filled with water and flowers cascading down. We used some mid-sized centerpieces. This turned out to be very positive since we grouped guests via commonality, and the centerpiece size allowed guests to talk to each other across the table, we had a number of guests positively comment on this. As we moved through the process we worked with a number of Wedgewood staff members, everyone genuinely seemed to enjoy their work. Until right before the wedding we largely worked with Tamica and with Taryn for the final meeting. Due to reviews we had read we asked David, but we were very lucky that we got Liz! Liz was great. She was able to walk us through all the details during the rehearsal and was able to provide minor solutions on the fly throughout the process. It was never forced, always on point. Don't know where to put your hands, do this, where should people sit, suggestions, how to deal with a wheelchair bound guest, she was on it. I was able to see her actively tackle problems that never occurred to anyone else before they became real problems. Of the vendors, Mandy from Whisk'd Away for the wedding cake was the best. The cake was thought through in a way I hadn't considered. A lot of guests don't like really sweet cake, but others won't touch cake that isn't. Mandy set the cake up so that it wasn't very sweet, but the buttercream on the exterior delivered the touch the sugar fiends wanted. Something that worked out well for us was that since our guest count increased as we came up on our wedding, our cake size was increased. She recommended that we could keep the cake size and supplement the balance with mini cupcakes. I had heard about how so much of the wedding cake is wasted, but you don't get to experience what they mean until you see it yourself. The thing is that the wedding cake usually isn't cut until late in the process, but the cupcakes and other desserts are out before food is served. Guests devoured any individual dessert on the table during the appetizers. We literally didn't have a single one left while easily half of the cake was uneaten or unserved. We could have doubled the amount of cupcakes, and they would have been eaten. People were looking for more. Basically, if you take one thing away from this review, it is that we were very satisfied with Rio Hondo. Both as a venue and their staff. This was a wonderful experience, and they made a complex event much easier. Thank you guys.

Everyone at Rio Hondo was an absolute joy to work with. Not once did I feel like I was being pushed to be sold a higher tier package. The venue is beautiful, it was reasonably pric...

ed, and the staff and planning team were just amazing. My (now) husband and I had no idea what we were doing when it came to wedding planning, and they really helped by walking us through everything step-by-step. They gave us a whole binder with everything we needed to know, with worksheets to fill out on our own if we wanted to add/take out/substitute literally anything within our wedding package. Everything is provided, the venue, the ceremony site, tables, chairs, dinnerware, bar, drinks, food, appetizers, and even references for florists, bakeries, dj’s, and officiants! All you had to do was figure out your decorations, and anything else you wanted to have in your wedding. They will even put up most of your decorations for you. When we booked the venue, we only had 7 months to prepare everything, and even then it didn’t feel as stressful as I thought it would. Don’t get me wrong, planning a wedding is still stressful. The Rio Hondo team really helped us get our bearings and plan this with relative ease. They will schedule multiple meetings with you through the planning phase to check in to make sure you’re on track. They will sit down with you when the day gets closer to get as much of the details down so that you and their team know what to expect. They even thought of details that never really crossed our minds. If you have no idea what you’re doing for wedding planning, or if you just want the planning process to be as close to being completely worry free, I highly suggest Wedgewood Rio Hondo!

covered! After my initial Zoom call with Joanne, I was convinced I had found something special. Her enthusiasm was infectious, and she radiated positivity without any sales pressure—just genuine support and information. Joanne is exactly the kind of person every bride hopes to work with! And let me tell you about Tamica—she is the ABSOLUTE BEST! Her patience, kindness, and insight made planning a breeze. She was always prompt for our meetings and answered my endless questions with grace. Working with her felt like collaborating with a friend who truly cares. Now, let’s talk about David—WOW! He was a lifesaver on the big day. He anticipated my needs before I even had to ask, jumping in to help whenever my bridesmaids called out. His attention to detail was impeccable, making everything flow seamlessly. Here are a few highlights that made our experience unforgettable: \- **All-Inclusive Bliss:** The all-inclusive package took so much stress off my shoulders! No hunting for a florist, bakery, DJ, or photographer—everything was conveniently provided. \- **Wedding Fair Magic:** The Wedding Fair was a fantastic experience! I loved being able to explore the venue, taste the delectable food and cake, see the bar in action, and even meet the chef. \- **Food That Wow-ed!** Let’s talk about the food—absolute bomb.com! The chef left no flavor behind, and I was flooded with compliments from guests after the wedding. Good food is crucial, and I would have been heartbroken if it had fallen flat. Thank you, chef! I even had someone ask for his contact info! WedgeWood Weddings made my wedding planning experience a joy. If you're searching for the perfect venue, look no further!

Rio Hondo absolutely exceeded my expectations and made our wedding day incredible. We are especially grateful for David, who was with us from our first planning meeting until the d...

ay of our wedding -- we truly could not have had a more amazing day-of coordinator. On our wedding day, David took care of all of our signage and decor and made sure it was set up exactly as we wanted, coordinated with all of the Rio Hondo vendors to ensure everything we'd asked for was going according to plan, and consistently checked in with us to make sure we were eating, drinking, and enjoying the day. We also heard from our parents that he regularly made sure that they were doing OK and to see if they needed anything, which we know meant a lot to them. David put the kind of care and attention into our wedding that we would have expected from a close friend or family member -- that is how genuinely invested we felt he was from beginning to end. All of Rio Hondo's vendors were amazing, as well! We worked with LMP photography, which was one of Rio Hondo's recommended vendors, Little Blue Hummingbird for florals, and DJ Scott. It made a real difference to work with vendors who knew the venue well, and made everything from communication to day-of coordination so much easier. The all-inclusive nature of the Rio Hondo packages was a big plus for us, and we were really thrilled to have it work out the way we had hoped. Annie with Little Blue Hummingbird deserves a special shoutout for making our vision for florals really come to life, and DJ Scott really went above and beyond to include all of the different kinds of music we requested while still creating a great atmosphere. Some of our guests even commented that they thought DJ Scott was a friend of ours given how kind and enthusiastic he was throughout the night. DJ Scott, David, and our LMP photographers all checked in with us throughout the night to make sure things were going on track and to make suggestions to the timeline as the day evolved. We also heard from a TON of guests about how great the food and drinks were, which really surpassed our expectations. We got particularly rave reviews about the appetizers, prime rib carving station (we booked the elite package, so that was included), and signature drinks -- it was so fun to be able to include that. Coming from someone who did a lot of research before choosing a venue -- after considering the quality of food and drinks, the value of all of the details that are included in the package, the beauty of the space, and the benefits of having high-quality vendors, coordinators, etc. who all work together, I have no doubt that Rio Hondo's offerings are a much better value than many of the other venues you can find in Los Angeles. We are incredibly grateful to the whole Rio Hondo team for making our day so special, and would absolutely recommend it to others.

I recently had my wedding at Wedgewood Wedding Rio Hondo in Downey in May, after a year of meticulous planning with their team. I am delighted to give the venue a 4-star rating. Th...

e sales and planning coordination team were exemplary, especially David and Tamica, who were consistently responsive through email and communication. The venue itself is stunning, and May proved to be the perfect time for a wedding. We chose Wedgewood Rio Hondo primarily due to its convenient location and its nearly all-in-one solution. While I had to handle many wedding details myself, the ability to choose from a selection of vendors within a single package was a significant advantage. David, our coordinator, was exceptional. He made the entire process stress-free and even assisted with my bridal veil hair accessory, which was a thoughtful touch. The only slight downside was the reception. Our guests experienced a longer wait for their food, and the taste was somewhat mediocre, despite opting for duel plated meals. Overall, I give Wedgewood Wedding Rio Hondo a solid 4/5, largely due to the outstanding efforts of David and the rest of the sales and coordination team.

pondence with multiple members of the Rio Hondo team, our meetings with the always-organized and smiling Joanne, and our wedding day with the fantastic and fun David, We loved that the price breakdowns were always transparent, our wedding binder kept us organized and on-track (especially as the bride was busy finishing her PhD program), and that the team was always available to answer questions. The venue was gorgeous, the food was delicious, and the coordination couldn't have been better. Everyone still tells us about how fantastic our wedding day was, but two things in particular stand out post-wedding: During our couples session at the waterfall(!!) David told us that a white bird landed right behind us, and that he saw it as a sign that the brides' grandmother (whom we were very close with - we had a lot of elements dedicated to her) was there watching over us. Second, when the bride's mother came back to Rio Hondo for a school event, David and Joanne both recognized her and excitedly greeted her! While Wedgewood Rio Hondo puts on tons of events, they truly care about their clients and their loved ones. Feeling that love and care, plus an amazing wedding to boot? You can't put a price tag on that. Thank you all so much for everything! -Mr. and Mrs. Valentin

We also really appreciate the flexibility with the Rio Hondo team as we are from out of town and planning a wedding long distance can be stressful. Rest assured the Rio Hondo team handled everything extremely professionally and with so much care! Huge shoutout to our wedding coordinators David and Tamica, they were spectacular and we felt taken care of from the rehearsal to the wedding day. David and Tamica went above and beyond and we felt we could trust them with anything! We will forever cherish their kindness and professionalism! We also wanted to give a huge shout out to the chef CJ, who cooked amazing food all day! Our guests could not stop talking about the food! In addition, both Natalia and Nestor, our banquet captains, were amazing all night and very attentive to any of our needs. We honestly had an amazing experience and would do it all over again at Rio Hondo!

with my fiance, and they always ensured we had all the things planned out and were on track. They helped us out with the cake, florist contact, DJ, and the open bar. There wasn't anything not being taken care of. Even the guest book table, was so amazingly set up. Also, we went for the food tasting at the wedding fair called extravaganza, and it really was clear what to expect, and we also met the other vendors there. Everyone was so nice and professional. Now, on the wedding day, I was so nervous I even didn't remember all the steps and the timeline, but Yesse and Sarah, made it all work out perfectly, I didn't have to ask any questions, it was all beautifully organized and it went very smoothly. The officiant Stan was amazing, DJ Cesar was so caring and he had the perfect music combination for us. it was so magical, thank you so much Wedgewood!!

Joanne, thank you for being so professional, relax, and communicative with the whole process. Nestor, thank you for being so cool, professional. The bartenders: Omar and Marissa were super great bartenders. They were engaging and not at all irritated by our loud guests compared to the previous weddings I've been too were typically the bartenders would look irritated, they were lively and very professional the whole time. Thank you for being patient with our guests and ourselves. They made tastiest drinks in the most efficient and professional way as possible. Our florists, Robert was sooo amazing!! Thank you for making the floral arrangements so beautiful and well above our expectations. Seeing the florals from the arch to our sweetheart table made it look for beautiful!! The food made by our chef was super delicious. Our guests could not stop talking about how the braised short rib and panko-crusted chicken were so good. We were hearing a battle of beef vs chicken the past few weeks after the wedding. It's rare for a wedding to have such wonderful meals. Keep doing what you're doing chef!! sorry I can't remember his name but my husband and I met him at the wedding extravaganza event. So happy we went since it made me changed our minds from choosing the chicken piccata to the panko-crusted chicken. The appetizers were super yummy!! loved the tuna tartare! Mindy and Stephanie, our guests loved the cake, even the non-cake lovers devoured them.

Would not recommend this venue to anyone who is looking for an organized team to help you with your wedding. 1\. They lack communication 2. The manager was extremely rude (when we ...

expressed our concerns about a month before the wedding, instead of trying to help, she asked if we wanted to even have our wedding at the venue if we have these concerns.) 3. They make promises when signing the contract and then later tell you that it won't happen. 4. As soon as you sign the contract they don't really care much for you and don't even bother. 5. They are just unprofessional. We booked this venue one year before the wedding and for that moment we were booking the venue, the coordinator was very nice and communicative, but as soon as we signed the contract we did not hear from them at all and we had to constantly message them even about payments. The person who signed our contract left the venue without notifying us and didn't even leave proper notes for the new coordinator. During the year we were waiting for the wedding, the venue made changes to the outside and we found out through instagram (and we hated the new look of the venue) and when speaking to the manager she told us that someone should have told us about the changes being made. We were told we would get a food tasting but we did not hear from the venue and when we asked we were told that we wouldn't be able to taste the food before choosing our food. After calls and emails back and forth we were able to get a tasting scheduled but the venue called us 30 minutes before the tasting that they couldn't accommodate us for another 2 hours. When you ask them a question, they scramble and can't give you a straight answer. We also later found out that the vendor they used for the photobooth ran out of paper not too long into the time we booked them and would not give our guests the number of pictures they were requesting. The only reason I am giving them 2 stars is because of our day of coordinator what was awesome, but we also did not know who that would be until the day before the wedding, and the cake vendor. They tell you how much they value your feedback and even send you an extensive feedback form to fill out but there is not follow up with the feedback. Also, they give you a bliss benefit package that is nearly useless but they hype it up.

e church where our ceremony was to be held and came across Rio Hondo in Downey. We had already gone to a few other locations (also hosted/organized by Wedgewood) but none of them seemed to fit our wants the way the Rio Hondo location did. Our Coordinator, Coco, was very helpful and informative. She seems to genuinely love what she does and made the entire process easy and fun! She showed us a couple of packages that would give us all the options we wanted without having to exceed our budget. There is a 10,000 minimum during holiday months but I feel that’s reasonable considering all that Wedgewood provides. Rather than having to hunt down our own vendors for flowers, catering, wedding cakes, decorations, DJs, and event rentals, Wedgewood offers everything in-house and has a list of vendors they can recommend to work with you. What I loved most about the planning process is how thorough they are. When you book with them, they give you a planning binder and schedule multiple planning appointments to help you along the way. I had a very short engagement (only 6 months) and was able to achieve my dream wedding because of how involved and supportive the team was. Coco, Yesse, Nester, and everyone at Rio Hondo really helped bring our vision for our wedding to life. I highly recommend booking your wedding with Wedgewood and their beautiful Rio Hondo location in Downey.

This venue could be good if they gave all their relevant information before hand. I spoke to several people as I used Wedgwood for my own wedding a few years ago and had an amazing...

experience, no hidden fees no minimums. Unfortunately that was not the case here. I confirmed that my daughters wedding date (Halloween) would be available and was sent a price list to get a feel of cost before we went for our viewing. Because I had such a great experience before I was pretty sure we would be booking this venue. When we arrived we were given a viewing and everything seemed ok. There were a few blocked off areas like the men’s bathroom and the area downstairs, not sure if they are remodeling. The event room was set up for a quinceañera and I did have to point out that the carpet was extremely dirty and stained so I asked if that would be cleaned, she did say it would. When we finally went upstairs to discuss the pricing. I was surprised to hear that they have a 10k minimum. This is not noted on anything I received from them in writing, on the website or in any of our correspondence with them. We had already discussed that we were only expecting 30-35 guests as it is a small intimate wedding. All their pricing suggested we would be spending a little under 5k. When I mentioned this she said we have an 8k min and 10k for holidays. I again stated no one informed me, she said her manager told her she had to charge it and there was no one to talk to about the matter it is what it is. Wedgewood prides themselves in no hidden fees, certainly not the case here. I drove from Northern California pretty set on this venue. I just want to forewarn people that for us at at least this venue did not meet up to the Wedgewood values.

We were able to bring our own dj, linens, and photo booth. Usually in other venues they make you choose from a list. So I liked that they allowed us to choose our own.
