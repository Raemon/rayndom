We had our wedding at The Club at Castlewood, and it was truly everything we hoped for and more. From the very beginning, the planning process was smooth, organized, and surprising...

ly stress-free. Sandy was absolutely wonderful to work with—friendly, professional, and incredibly attentive. Her communication was excellent throughout, and she always made us feel supported and confident that everything was on track. Any time we had a question or needed guidance, she was quick to respond and always went the extra mile to help. The food was exceptional, and we continue to hear compliments from our guests about how delicious everything was. The presentation and service were top-notch, making the meal feel even more special. Of course, one of the biggest highlights of Castlewood is the stunning views. The scenery created the most beautiful backdrop for our ceremony and photos—truly picture-perfect. It added such a magical feel to the day that we’ll never forget. The staff’s attention to detail was evident in every moment. From the décor setup to the timing of events, everything was handled with care and precision. We felt completely taken care of and able to enjoy our wedding without any worries. Overall, the entire experience was seamless and enjoyable. If you’re looking for a venue that combines beauty, great service, and an easy, well-supported planning process, we wholeheartedly recommend The Club at Castlewood. It was the perfect place to celebrate our special day.

The Club at Castlewood - the venue is absolutely perfect. It is a beautiful place to get married. The palm trees that line the entrance is such a show-stopper. Sandy and her team w...

ere so receptive and responsive to everything my husband and I wanted. I used an outside caterer as my husband and I wanted family-style Asian cuisine so I cannot speak to the food here. I had a guest count of a bit less than 200. Pros: \- Multiple locations for guests to hang out and mingle that wasn’t the reception hall (outside patio, indoor bar area with couches, lobby area with more couches) \- Bar area was huge and quick to serve my guests. Many guests told me the bartenders that worked at our wedding were some of the best ones they’ve seen. We upgraded the bar package at the last minute, and it was worth it to us. \- The men and women’s locker room has a cute area to get ready in, chairs, couches, lounge chairs, make up stations (and showers)! They also have a lot of amenities including razors, combs, hairspray, deodorant, etc. \- Service was awesome. They refilled waters, bussed tables, all of the above. \- Allowed us to leave our decor there the day prior so we wouldn’t have to do it the day-of (even though there was an event the night before!) It was about 4 large totes, 6 smaller ones, and a few easels. \- We had asked for a golf cart to wheel some older guests back up to the reception area after the ceremony. They almost forgot this until my coordinator asked the banquet manager. Thankfully they were able to do it for us in the end. Cons: \- Outside caterer has to cook outside which is one level below the reception hall. This is particularly difficult without an elevator to help get to the reception area, especially since we were doing family-style and not buffet, which means plates for each and every table. We were able to come to an agreement on how to make it work, but it was a bit challenging on all parts. \- There’s no dedicated bridal suite so my things were out in the open for the club members to see and possibly take. On the day of, it didn’t matter too much as nothing went missing, but it was stressful thinking about it leading up to the event. I also felt bad I basically took over the whole area away from the club members. It would be helpful to have our own space to change. \- That being said, there isn’t a designated groom suite either. He had to leave his clothes in the women’s locker room after changing. We knew about the cons before booking with Castlewood, but due to how beautiful it was and that they could hold my guest count indoors in a reception room, we went with them anyway, but I still wanted to point those out to future brides and grooms.

"I remember walking into the reception room at Castlewood and thinking it looked like a fairytale." I know my wife well (lol) and she does not say things like this lightly! We had ...

a fabulous experience with Castlewood. We wanted someplace that was lovely but not over the top. The venue delivers. I especially love the vaulted foyer, the giant tree on the south lawn (southwest? Oak?), and the ballroom. My wife was not exaggerating - they really did a terrific job with the decorations. From the flowers to the table settings to the backdrop, I felt it set the tone we wanted for our guests, that it was a special occasion but also a relaxed one. Juliet was a star for us. First, she worked hard with my family to understand and execute what we wanted. Having to balance the many, sometimes differing needs of all the parties (bride/groom/family; different cultural needs) can be quite a challenge, but she was up to it. Second, on the day of our event, some things (through no fault of Castlewood's) didn't go quite according to plan. Juliet provided an air of calm at a time not everybody was calm, and things got back on track. This I appreciate perhaps more than anything Castlewood did - it's that Juliet really set a tone of, "this is gonna be OK." Really helped me enjoy, rather than worry. One thing to note is that Castlewood is a functioning golf club, so you may not -- as we didn't -- have full dominion over the property. If I were shopping this place, I would definitely ask Juliet about the needs of club members and how they may or may not conflict with what you want to do. For us it wasn't a problem. Get married here!

Castlewood is a beautiful venue and Juliet (their onsite coordinator) was a delight to work with. The outdoor area for the ceremony is absolutely beautiful--nestled in the hills,...

overlooking the valley, and set on the grass underneath a huge oak tree. It is located in the tri-valley, so it can get very hot on summer days. Fortunately, we were blessed with beautiful weather, which made for a perfect day. Castlewood is truly is a lovely site with lots of natural beauty--between the hills, the views of the valley/distant Mt. Diablo, the old oak trees, the palm tree-lined driveway, and the golf course greens--it has a wonderful display of tri-valley's natural beauty! Lots of good great spots for photos, although be warned: photos on the golf course aren't really condoned (for obvious reasons like flying golf balls), and photos of the impressive palm tree driveway can be tough to get (due to traffic coming to/from the club). All in all, the site is gorgeous. We especially loved working with Castlewood because so many services were provided under one roof and we didn't need to rent our own chairs, tables, dishware, or linens (such a relief!) like at many other venues we considered. They also do all of the catering on site--so one less vendor to worry about! The service was terrific at the bar and throughout the food service. We had relatively big wedding (about 230 guests), so we were a little worried folks may be served at different times, etc. However, we didn't need to worry, because all the food came out together, with consistent quality across the board. The food was delicious, and we heard great feedback from our guests on all of it. The outdoor patio (with valley views) off of the bar area is a great added benefit to the reception site. We were so happy we chose Castlewood as our venue, and would recommend it to other couples looking!

size dance floor. The coordinator, Randie, was amazing to work with. She was helpful, answered any and all questions. She made sure our vision was seen. She gave suggestions, if we were at a loss. Also, very patient with brides that have meltdowns. The rest of the staff at Castlewood was amazing as well. Banquet team was awesome. Took care of the Bride and groom! The bridal party mentioned they were impressed with the attentiveness of the team as well. When we originally signed with Castlewood the ballroom had an old-school vibe, but they have redone (fresh paint on the walls, took down the orange brown curtains) the room. It was redone by the time we got married! It looked awesome! Also, food was delicious. Many of our guest could not stop talking about the food! Lastly, the grounds are pretty. Our photographer captured great photos! So many great things at Castlewood! So happy we chose this place to be part our wedding day!

We searched for a perfect venue and both my husband and I loved Castlewood when we were doing our search. Jessica was very helpful and worked well with our wedding coordinator. ...

The only thing was that we had to order our own salad plates. Other than that the service was perfect and the staff kept checking in on me and my husband during the reception. The oak tree is a beautiful venue site as well.

romised no cars in the parking lot near the Oak and there was. Also there were still people teeing off after our ceremony (5:40) and it messed up some photo ops we wanted. Other than that, Karen was great to work with and Castlewood staff was amazing. There were a few snotty club members that didnt like the bridal party getting ready in "their" locker room but I didnt let them get to me on my day
