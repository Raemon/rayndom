## What is a Silicone Engagement Ring? 

As the name suggests, silicone engagement rings are rings that are made of medical-grade silicone. While the reasons for choosing a silicone engagement ring may differ, many people choose to wear them as a durable and comfortable alternative to a traditional engagement ring for travel, work or exercise. While some people have a silicone ring as an additional ring to wear instead of their traditional engagement ring in certain settings, others prefer the comfort and feel of a silicone engagement ring and wear it as their primary everyday ring.

They also make a great, [inexpensive wedding ring](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-to-save-money-on-wedding-ring) alternative for travel.
