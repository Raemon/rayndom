AWARD WINNER (7X)

Thanks to recommendations from couples on The Knot

Voted one of the Best Wedding Photographers in California, I specialize in capturing weddings with an editorial-meets-documentary style — a perfect blend of natural, candid storytelling and timeless, beautifully composed images. Whether it’s your wedding day, an engagement session, or even a boudoir or family shoot, my goal is always the same: to create photos and films that feel authentic, emotional, and beautiful. You’ll get a mix of elegant, editorial portraits alongside the in-between moments that truly tell your story. Photography isn’t just my job — it’s my passion. I see every wedding as a chance to create art that reflects your love, joy, and connection in a way that feels personal and lasting. I’d love the honor of capturing your day. Take a peek at my portfolio, and let’s chat about how we can make your vision come to life!

Working with Remo was one of the best decisions we made for our wedding. We first did an engagement shoot with him, and we were so blown away by his professionalism, creativity, an...

d talent that hiring him for our wedding was an easy choice. From the very beginning, Remo was incredibly punctual, organized, and easy to communicate with. He is also just an extremely nice and easy-going person, which made the entire experience even more enjoyable. He helped us feel completely comfortable in front of the camera, and that comfort shows in every photo. On our wedding day, Remo exceeded every expectation. His eye for detail, artistic vision, and ability to capture both the big emotional moments and the quiet in-between moments made our photos truly unforgettable. He worked seamlessly throughout the day, always present but never intrusive, and kept everything running smoothly. The final galleries from both our engagement shoot and our wedding were absolutely stunning! Beautifully edited, timeless, and felt true to us as a couple. We would hire him again and again without hesitation. If you’re looking for a photographer who is talented, reliable, and genuinely wonderful to be around, Remo is the one. We can’t recommend him highly enough!!!!

We cannot recommend Remo Fioroni highly enough. He photographed our wedding in San Francisco this past October, and from start to finish, the experience was exceptional. We live in...

Santa Fe, NM, and after reading countless reviews and hearing strong recommendations, we knew Remo was the right choice—and he absolutely delivered. Remo was professional, calm, and incredibly intuitive on the wedding day. He made us feel completely at ease, captured moments we didn’t even realize were happening. If you’re considering a destination wedding or getting married in San Francisco, do yourself a favor and book Remo, you’ll be happy that you did.

We still can’t believe we found Remo. My husband and I decided to have two completely different weddings, one in Scottsdale, Arizona, and the other in Paris, France, and we hired R...

emo for BOTH. Best decision ever! Remo has the calmest, most reassuring presence you could ever want on your wedding day(s). Whether we were melting in 105 °F Arizona heat or dodging pigeons in Paris, he never rushed us, never stressed, and somehow made every moment feel easy and fun. In Scottsdale he gave us that magical golden desert light, and in Paris he delivered the most timeless, chic shots imaginable. The rooftop portrait with the Eiffel Tower sparkling behind us and candles glowing everywhere, iconic!! Absolute love. The photo of us crossing the street in front of the Panthéon with my dress flying and the city buzzing around us is hands-down the coolest picture we’ve ever been in. Every single photo feels romantic, editorial, and completely timeless. If you want photos that look like they belong in a fashion magazine but still feel 100 % you, hire Remo like, yesterday. He flew across the world for us and gave us art we’ll hang on our walls forever. We love him and will recommend him to everyone we know. Thank you, Remo, for the most beautiful memories we’ll ever have.

s very attentive with any questions I had along the way. We planned our wedding from across the country, so we didn't meet Remo until the day of our wedding. But you would have never guessed. Remo was so kind and professional, we felt like we had known him for a long time. He made us feel super comfortable in front of the camera. Both he and his assistant were excellent at guiding us through poses and candids. He helped us stay on track with our timeline and helped us find the best photo spots in Downtown San Jose. We also got our wedding album back much sooner than anticipated - and the photos are GORGEOUS!!! We were beyond thrilled to get the photos quickly to be able to share with loved ones who couldn't make it. It's so nice to be able to look back on our wedding with these beautiful photos. He perfectly captured all the love and emotions of the day. I don't think I could have asked for a better photographer! So if you're looking for a photographer, stop reading and CALL Remo right now!

passion for photography shines through in every interaction, and his warm, friendly demeanor made us feel completely at ease. On our wedding day, Remo was a true professional. He blended seamlessly into the background while still managing to capture every precious moment. His ability to document both the big events and the candid, intimate moments was impressive. We were amazed at how he captured the emotions of the day—the laughter, the tears, and the joy—all in stunning detail. The final photos are absolutely breathtaking. Each image tells a story, showcasing the beauty of our love and the magic of our celebration. The way Remo plays with natural light and composition is simply incredible. We have received endless compliments on our photos from family and friends, and we couldn't be happier with the results. If you are looking for a photographer who is not only talented but also genuinely cares about making your day special, look no further than Remo at Fioroni Photography.

nal and multi-cultural weddings — it was important to me that our photographer could expertly capture our deeper complexions, without too much editing/filters. On both days, he was such a breeze to work with. He has a calming and positive presence, which helps a ton when you’re surround by nervous & exciting energy! He was super professional, patient, and incredibly attentive — he was there for every single moment, and managed to be everywhere at the same time without getting in the way of the flow of events! Ultimately, we knew we made the right decisions once we saw the photo gallery — every single picture was STUNNING!! His photography captured every moment with such authenticity, while somehow elevating everything to look even more beautiful than they were in person! We’ve been obsessed with how all the photos came out.

Remo was referred to us by a friend for our post wedding photo shoot. I'm so glad he was available! He captured the most beautiful pictures! Before we get to the actual pictures,...

I'd like to point out how professional and prompt he is. All of my communication with him was professional, timely and positive. Prior to our shoot he was sure to connect with me over the phone to discuss details and answer any questions I had. The day of our shoot, he arrived to the venue before our scheduled time and took the time to scope the grounds for the best locations to take pics. During the shoot, he was patient, gave directions and made sure we looked perfect! You cannot tell that these pics weren't taken on our actual wedding day. We are so happy to have been referred to him. If you're looking for a wedding photographer, I 100% recommend!

One tip I do want to provide the brides is to be sure to communicate if you have any specific photos you want like at your reception or otherwise. There were certain things I planned at the reception that I didn’t get to see and don’t have photos of because I assumed they would be captured. Don’t assume! Be sure to communicate with Remo. Thanks again Remo for being such a great guy and for capturing our special day. We couldn’t be happier with our photos 🥰

He kept us on track for photos we had requested before the wedding and came up with new ideas for photos throughout the wedding (most of which I like more than the ones we requested). We got our teasers no more than a few days after our wedding and received the rest (600 pictures) in record time. Couldn’t be more appreciative of Remo and his hard work, thank you for everything!

He stuck with us as our original May 2020 wedding was postponed to the even more spectacular October 16th, 2021, and we appreciated his flexibility. His warmth, professionalism, and obvious joy and passion for his work carried through in every moment! He smiled along with us throughout our day and made us feel so at ease and comfortable.

It's obvious that he loves his job and really enjoys connecting with the couple he is working with. We also had two engagement sessions (since we postponed our wedding b/c of the pandemic) and loved the pictures from both sessions. He has great ideas and is also willing try to new poses, locations, etc. It's hard to believe we don't have anything to look forward to with Remo, but we will definitely be reaching out for him to capture the next special event in our relationship!

He's also an excellent portrait photographer as well. Our wedding was outdoors and during the ceremony, we were backlit against the sun, but the photos came out bright and gorgeous due to his fantastic skills behind the camera and during editing. My husband and I were so happy to have him as our professional wedding photographer for our special day.

He was punctual and took great care to ensure that he captured some great images of our day. One of the best things I liked about Remo was his communication even after the event. He kept us updated on turn-around time and to my surprise, we got our photos back in record time! The work product that we received from Remo was great. We were very pleased and will keep in mind for family photos in the future. Thanks, Remo!

He had us the photos back in a week and they were stunning!! I've "favorited" over half the shots he took. I would give him more than 5 stars if I could and hope to use him in the future for a big vow renewal since we didn't get the big celebration this round.

His work also comes out so beautifully. He has a great eye for EVERYTHING...posing, location, backgrounds, venue decor, special moments, he catches great candid photos too. He does great at blending in, even though our wedding was a small backyard gathering, he was never in the way. He captured every moment of our perfect day, made us feel beautiful and handsome. It couldn’t have been better. I will always recommend Remo, and continue to use him for any future professional photos we need!

h photo feel like one is able to relive the moment as if you were actually there. Even with the venue taking place in a planetarium with low lighting, he was able to bring the pictures to life with little to no editing. Trusting Remo's skills with the photos we saw from that day, we hired him once again to do our engagement photoshoot. Hearing his experience with previous clients and working with him on the best places for the shoots, we were able to build more trust in our cliental relationship. The day of the shoot was a fun-filled day showing our best selves, trusting certain pose shots that he suggested. Even braving cold and windy weather in order to capture the best shots for us. Because of the amazing success of the last two events, in made sense to only hire the best for our wedding day. Arriving on time and bringing a great assistant on the day of, he was able to communicate clearly on the important shots he needed without it feeling overwhelming. Like on the engagement day, he was able to capture the intimate moments while also making it feel like you can relive it every time you see a photo. Also like on the engagement photoshoot, he made us feel comfortable for our vineyard and family shots. If you are in need of a great photographer who you can trust like family, look no further. You can find all of that in Remo. Thank you for everything you have done for us! We cannot wait to hire you more future events!

Remo has a discerning eye for what shots will look best, while also very flexible to the photo opportunities that presented themselves throughout the evening.

Your photographer is a person who you spend a lot of time with on your wedding day so it was important to us that we found someone who would capture great moments and would be fun to be around all day. Remo did both of those things and more! When you first Remo, it is immediately apparent how friendly and thoughtful he is. It was so easy for us to open up as we took photos with Remo because he has such great energy and positivity that made us feel so comfortable in front of the camera. That sense of comfort and fun translated so well – we love our wedding photos! Remo’s photos captured our day so perfectly. The pictures were so beautiful, natural, and candid. We’re so thankful to Remo for providing us with such amazing images that we will treasure for the rest of our lives!

Remo had a lot of ideas as to where to take photographs around City Hall but was also open to our requests/ recommendations as well. Remo was also very accommodating. My fiancé and I wanted to take photos after the ceremony by the Golden Gate Bridge (weather permitting) . It happened to be a gorgeous day in the city and Remo was able to extend our session and drive with us down to Chrissy Field to get some shots with the bridge in the background. We are so glad we chose Remo to photograph our wedding and highly recommend him!

We spoke a few times prior to the event and corresponded through emails up until the day. On the day, Remo and his assistant covered every aspect of our event completely and provided us with the most amazing images. He focuses so much on capturing the littlest of details to ensure that the memories will stay with us or a lifetime. He applies more of a journalistic approach to covering weddings so that event can be relived over and over again. We highly recommend Remo and plan to use him again for any other events that we have in the future.

, his goal is to tell your wedding's story. As our storyteller, Remo was a consummate professional. He suggested coming to our rehearsal, which we highly recommend to anyone. It is a great idea. He gave us pointers to produce the best photographs during the ceremony and also saw our families' dynamics, which he later incorporated into the pictures he took. The day of the wedding was wonderful. Remo and his assistant took us to some great spots for pictures and gave us lots of fun and cute poses. At the reception, we emphasized how important pictures of the dancing and toast were. Remo got us those shots! They are some of our favorites. On top of all of this, Remo was fun, easygoing, and a joy to work with. If we could give a review of 5/5 stars we wouldn't. We'd give 6!
