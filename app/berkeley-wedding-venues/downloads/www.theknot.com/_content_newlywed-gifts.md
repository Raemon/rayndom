Not all holiday presents for newlyweds have to be sentimental. A Solo Stove fire pit is a practical gift that'll heat up their backyard without smoke or fumes. This compact design fits on an outdoor table and can be fueled by traditional firewood or wood pellets. Choose from several colors or get them a [gift card](https://www.solostove.com/us/en-us/p/gift-card?sku=E-GIFT-CARD-WHT&color=White) so they can pick their own.

How about a funny gift for the newlyweds? Tickle their funny bone with this hilariously practical blanket that's split down the middle and attached at the bottom. No matter how much each person pulls on their side of the blanket, the other won't feel a thing. Translation: No more fighting over who gets the duvet.
