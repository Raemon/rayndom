**In this article:**Best Wedding Song Requests | How to Ask Wedding Guests to Request a Song

## Best Wedding Song Requests

These guest-requested hits aren't just trending—they're proven crowd-pleasers. Ahead, we tapped two DJs to share their most requested wedding dance songs.

### 1\. "Yeah!" Usher

According to DJ Anthony Hernandez of [Infinity Sound Productions](https://theknot.com/marketplace/infinity-sound-productions-miami-fl-841878) in Miami, Florida, this early 2000s throwback remains a surefire way to get the party started. "These tracks always light up the party," he says of high-energy anthems like this one that blend nostalgia with infectious beats.

### 2\. "Dancing On My Own," Robyn

Andrea Smith, owner of[ The Band Method](https://www.thebandmethod.com/) in New York City, says this synth-pop staple is one of her top requested wedding songs of the decade. She goes on to describe it as "seminal as it is sonically unique."

### 3\. "Don't Stop Believin'," Journey

Some songs stand the test of time, and this '80s hit is one of them. Hernandez says this anthem continues to "light up the party," even decades after its initial release.

### 4\. "A Milli," Lil Wayne

"A Milli" might not be your typical wedding track, but its punchy bass and cultural staying power make it a go-to guest request, Smith says. Just be warned: "Be careful with your speakers—the bass is unreal!"

### 5\. "September," Earth, Wind & Fire

This funk favorite will have guests out of their seats and grooving, Hernandez says. He continues, telling The Knot, "People love the nostalgia and feel-good energy."

### Find your kind of venue

From barns to ballrooms, discover reception venues that feel like you.

### 6\. "Mr. Brightside," The Killers

According to Hernandez, pop throwbacks like this one from The Killers are guaranteed to light up the dance floor at weddings.

## How to Ask Wedding Guests to Request a Song

Want to make sure your guests' favorite tracks make it into the DJ's rotation without disrupting the vibe? From prewedding RSVPs to real-time reception requests, here are the best ways to collect song requests for your wedding while keeping the energy exactly where you want it.

### Include Wedding RSVP Cards With Song Requests

Including a line for music requests on your [RSVP cards](https://www.theknot.com/paper/rsvp-cards) is an easy and low-effort way to gather guest input before the big day. This wedding song request idea works exceptionally well if your RSVP cards match your invitation suite and wedding website. Just be sure to give guests some guidance and keep it optional.

You can also include a separate insert or wedding song request card—but either way, be sure to keep the tone fun and optional. Not sure how to phrase it? Here are two[ wedding RSVP wording](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-rsvp-wording-ideas) ideas to help you hit all the right notes (pun intended, of course).

**Example One:**

  * What song will get you on the dance floor?



**Example Two:**

  * Song request (optional, but encouraged!)



### Use Your Wedding Website to Collect Song Requests

If you're going digital-first, your [wedding website](https://www.theknot.com/gs/wedding-websites) is the perfect place to gather guest song requests alongside their RSVP. Guests can use the [wedding invitation QR code](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-qr-code) to respond directly on your site. You might include the prompt in your[ wedding website FAQs](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-website-faq-page) section or on the RSVP page itself. Think of it as a modern take on the traditional wedding song request card.

Meanwhile, everything—from head counts to song picks—stays streamlined thanks to The Knot's [guest list tool](https://www.theknot.com/gs/guest-list): an easy, all-in-one way to keep track of music preferences without juggling spreadsheets or last-minute texts.

**Example One:**

  * Tell us your must-play jam—we're building the ultimate dance floor lineup.



**Example Two:**

  * Is there a song that will guarantee you'll get up and dance? Add it here!



### At the Wedding Itself

Even with a well-curated playlist, guest song requests during the reception are bound to happen—and when handled well, they can lead to some of the night's most joyful surprises. "If a guest requests a popular song by a popular artist, i.e., Beyoncé, I'll pretend like I don't know who Beyoncé is before smiling and letting them know I'm just kidding," Smith says. Additionally, "If a guest requests a song that I know will work next in the mix, I'll tell them I don't have it… only to drop it seconds later and create a big moment of surprise and joy."

Ultimately, it's essential to inform your DJ in advance how flexible you'd like them to be with real-time requests. But once the party's underway, trust that the pros know how to read the room and keep the energy high.

**Example One:**

  * Got a request? The DJ's all ears—if it fits the vibe, it might just make the cut.



**Example Two:**

  * Have a favorite jam? Tell our DJ and we'll do our best to play it!



## How to Set Song Boundaries Without Stressing Your Guests

Hernandez tells The Knot that it's entirely normal for couples to have a[ do-not-play list](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-songs-to-skip)—and experienced DJs know how to honor it without creating awkward moments. "We never tell guests directly that the couple said 'no,'" he explains. "We'll say we're steering away from that style tonight, or that we'll try to work it in later." For inappropriate[ wedding songs](https://www.theknot.com/content/inappropriate-wedding-songs) and ones that just don't fit the vibe, the DJ politely lets guests know that we may not be able to fit it in."

The key is to communicate your boundaries clearly before the big day; that way, your DJ can deflect requests graciously while keeping the energy up. Ultimately, says Hernandez, "It's all about reading the room, feeling the vibe and delivering the experience that keeps everyone dancing all night long." He adds, "That's the art of DJing."
