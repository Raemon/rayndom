nd the prefect dress. Also, they really make you feel welcome and taken care of, unlike some other salons. I'd seen photos of an Aire Barcelona dress I loved the look of, but could not locate a sample to try on in California. By the time I reached out to BoLee Bridal, the designer had already released a newer collection of dresses, further complicating the search. BoLee Bridal was able to locate a sample they could have shipped to their location specifically so I could try it on - and they did it cheaper and faster than any other store I had contacted! Speed was important to me, because my mom was on hospice at the time, and I was desperate to pick my dress with her while I still could. Our outing was made more special by the lovely showroom and warm, welcoming staff. They even let my appointment run a little long so we could try on wedding veils and jewelry and plan the complete wedding-day look! I'm always going to be grateful to BoLee Bridal for helping me share one last special wedding moment with my mom before she passed!

m SO glad I chose BoLee Bridal Couture for my wedding gown. Not only is the owner Bo a really nice person but she knew exactly what pieces to show me based on what I told her I had...

in mind. I’m not one who enjoys trying on dress after dress and this was a good thing as she just picked out 4 dresses she thought I’d like and she was right. Each one was better than the previous one and the last one was just the best that I didn’t hesitate to say yes to my dress. After my alterations she also very sweetly helped me pack my extremely bulky gown into my cabin baggage because my airline was just being difficult in saying if they’d le me hang my dress on the plane.Another good thing here is they have all the light settings so you can see what your dress looks like in all lights, daytime, reception etc . The overall service here is amazing and they really make you feel special with the one on one experience rather than the very commercial feel I got from the other places . Thank you so much Bo for helping me find my dream dress !

Like many others, I also said YES to the dress at BoLee Bridal! I was referred by a friend who also found her dress at BoLee Bridal. I stopped by on a Stella York trunk show day ...

and I was sold on day one! Irina helped me through the entire process (in and out of dresses, personal photographer, etc). The small touches meant a lot to me, like a small chalkboard outside of the dressing room that said "Congratulations Ashley!" TBH I didn't care for the first dress that she brought out, but once I put it on - that was it. I guess I fell for the "never judge a dress on a hanger!" After picking up the dress and veil, I received an email with recommendations for alterations (recommended seamstress was great!). Prices are reasonable for a wedding dress and I feel like it looked at least double the price! As a very picky bride, I must say that I would only recommend a place that shows care, thoughtfulness, and pride for their work. You won't be disappointed with BoLee Bridal!

BoLee Bridal Couture saved my wedding day! My fiancé is in the military and we had planned to do a civil ceremony when come home for Christmas, however we decided to just have a we...

dding instead. This gave us about two months to plan the wedding and I was overwhelmed by stress. My biggest concern was getting a dress in time! After visiting David's Bridal and Trudy's I was very confused on what to do and did not have high hopes for my perfect dress. Both options were not perfect, but would do simply because I would have the dress by my wedding day. I was feeling pretty down about the whole situation. The next day I drove an hour and a half to look at dresses and I just so happened to stumble upon BoLee Bridal Couture. I went inside and was greeted by Bo. She was booked for the day (remember it is important to have an appointment) and was very willing to hear me out. I explained my situation and asked if I could browse at dresses, then go ahead and make an appointment if I found something I liked. I found a dress and went to go tell her I would like to make an appointment. She had about 20 minutes until her next appointment and let me try the dress on. As soon as I put it on I knew it was the perfect dress!! Since my wedding was so close it was hard to order any dresses, so Bo sold me the dress I tried on. I can not thank Bo enough for being so kind, gracious, and understanding. The atmosphere of her store is so relaxed and happy, the store itself is very clean, the service is top notch, and the quality of the dresses is outstanding! I would absolutely recommend this store to anyone and everyone! Thank you Bo for helping me get my PERFECT dress for my special day!!

Post-wedding, I can't believe I forgot to leave a review for BoLee Bridal Couture. I was referred here by my friend who got married a year ago. She's a picky lady, so I knew I coul...

d trust BoLee since she referred them to me. I found THE dress, literally, within 5 minutes of my first appointment. I had my sisters and Mom tag along with me, because I had ZERO clue of what I wanted and knew that their input would be vital. I forgot who assisted me the first time, but everyone who helped me then and thereafter were amazing and super friendly. Bo was also the sweetest lady I've ever met! Anyway, long story short, I ended up with a Pronovias Mildred - THE most amazing dress ever. Surprisingly, this was the easiest part of Wedding planning for me & it was all thanks to the awesome staff at BoLee. John - who works in-house at BoLee as the alterations master - was also amazing! My dress was altered perfectly from the beginning and I never ran into problems. PRO-TIP: Schedule an appointment NOW. Bo and her team are great ladies and you'll find a dress in no time.

Like many brides these days, I went to Yelp in hopes to find the perfect bridal gown shop. I decided on five different shops and ended up scheduling my last appointment among the f...

ive with BoLee Bridal Couture. There were so many pros and cons with the other four bridal shops but I can only recall pros while working with BoLee Bridal./ When first walking in BoLee Bridal, I was very impressed by their showroom layout. The boutique was so welcoming, organized, clean, spacious, and smelled great too! All of the workers were very friendly and accommodating. They offered drinks upon arrival which was a very nice touch./ Ashley was assigned to help me find my dress. She asked what I liked, didn’t like, and everything in between. She asked what my budget was and was not taken back by how small it was. I can’t recall how many dresses Ashley had me try on, but I do remember they were all very beautiful and well within my budget. However, none of them felt like “the one”. Right before our appointment was about to end, she asked if I was open to wear a dress with some color. I said it wouldn’t hurt to try one out since I had been focusing on ivory dresses. Ashley came back with a blush Stella York dress. I tried it on, walked out to show my mom and bridesmaids and almost immediately the girls were in tears saying that was “the dress”. I put my deposit down right then and there./ I decided to have alterations done at BoLee Bridal as well. Their alterations tailor, John, was awesome. The cost of alterations was slightly on the pricier side, but I knew I did not want to risk the chance of an “affordable seamstress” to ruin my dress to save a couple of bucks. I am sooooo glad I went with BoLee – John to do my alterations. My dress turned out absolutely perfect and fit me like a glove. Thank you John for working your magic!/ Everyone complimented how gorgeous my wedding dress was. My husband kept on telling me how beautiful I looked in my dress throughout the day. There are millions of pretty dresses in the world and I can’t believe Ashley of BoLee Bridal helped me find the perfect one for me!

Based on Yelp reviews, I chose 3 bridal stores to go to and the first on the list was Bo Lee. I made an appointment and went in with a couple bridesmaids and my mom. I loved this...

place! It was fun looking through all the dresses and choosing all the ones I liked. The place is nice and clean and offers complimentary drinks such as water, coffee, or hot tea. Anyways, I filled my room with about 20 dresses and the first 3 I tried on I loved but my favorite was #3- Cecil from Alyn. So, I tried on all the rest of my dresses and kept comparing them to my fave and they did not come close- I tried on lace, poofy, different styles- a little of everything! What I loved about the dress I chose was that it was not only gorgeous but it was light! I tried on a few dresses that were really really heavy! So, with consulting my bridesmaids and mom, I decided to go with my gut and get the dress. There was no use in going to the other bridal stores, Bo Lee was way more than good enough and I was really impressed with their service. I chose to do the alterations package with Bo Lee and it cost $475 (from what I remember) which included 3 fittings and a final dress steaming. Mai helped me out trying on the dresses and with each fitting and she was wonderful- I didn't feel awkward getting into the dresses and she was very professional. What I also liked was that it was Mai that helped me in all of my appointments and not a different person each time- even though I'm sure the other employees are just as good but I liked Mai ! John did my alterations and he was great as well- very friendly and professional. At my last fitting, the dress was a little too tight so it took him less than 10 minutes to loosen it and it fit perfectly! I am SO happy with the service I got at Bo Lee and of course, with my dress!

My first day of wedding dress shopping was really disheartening. I didn't find anything and the 2 stores I went to weren't welcoming at all. But on day 2, I got the experience I wa...

s hoping for and envisioning. My mom and 2 of my bridesmaids came shopping with me and really enjoyed the experience as well. From the moment we walked in, we knew they were there to cater to one bride at a time. The store was beautiful and the staff welcomed us as soon as we walked in. We were given water and allowed to drink our wine, far from the dresses of course. :) I knew I had found my dress when they took me into the "special lighting" room. One dressing room is set with lighting to simulate candle light and reception room lighting. It just made the dress sparkle. They also found me the perfect veil to compliment my dress. I was also impressed that they had dresses in my price range and were willing to do a military discount as well. After a rough start, I was so happy to have found BoLee Bridal. I highly recommend this store to any bride.

I loved my experience at BoLee Bridal from start to finish in the search for my wedding dress. BoLee was the first shop I went to and I had already found the dress during my first ...

appointment here but went ahead to one other shop to make sure that I made the right decision. I came prepared by finding out what designers BoLee carried, googled that designer up and pinned on Pintrest any dresses that caught my eye. During my appointment, I simply showed my consultant those dresses and she was actually able to pull up most of the dresses I had pinned and it gave her a good idea of what I was looking for. While my appointment was about to end, and I had not found the dress yet, BoLee herself (the owner) pulled a dress that was on a trunk show sale, and that dress became THE dress. My dress was a sample dress but was marked 50% off "as is" and because of that promotion, I was able to afford it. Ladies, I'm telling you when you find the dress and you get that magical feeling inside, look no further. There's not going to be anything better out there once you found the one, (just like when you found your groom!). I also decided to do my alterations at BoLee as well and was very pleased with the final fit. At BoLee they do charge a flat fee for alterations versus other locations which may charge per service. The customer service I received here was exceptional and made my wedding planning experience so relaxing and enjoyable.

For example, my dress originally included a flower where the train started, and she removed it from the sample because it just didn't look good - which was so true! The women who helped me out with my dress fittings were really nice, not pushy and helpful too.

e is extremely high end with a great selection of dresses. The owner Bo and her employees are great to work with. All of the dresses were in great shape, even though they were samples (which are usually pretty beat up). They gave me a great deal on my dress and my veil, which were both San Patrick. I took a while to decide what I wanted and they didn't make me feel rushed or I was being an inconvenience at all. I would recommend this place to any bride.

I went there and was greeted by a cute employee who was very welcoming. She gave me something to drink and had me fill out a form with questions about the wedding ceremony details....

I told her what I wanted and wanted to try on and had the chance to try a lot of dresses. The employee took pictures for me and also helped me get in and out of the dresses. The service is awesome. The price seemed to be affordable and the dresses are beautiful. I didn't end up getting my dress here, but I would recommend this place.

I had driven by this shop a million times on my drive to and from work. After visiting 4 other bridal shops, trying on around 50 dresses, and being very frustrated I decided to che...

ck out their yelp rating and was blown away by the 5 stars. I was able to make a same day appointment, grabbed my #1 bridesmaid, and headed over. I was initially greeted by the owner who was also my consultant. She offered us coffee, tea, water....i needed serious caffeine and was surprised when she brought out a full coffee service. She asked me what I was looking for in a dress. After detailing what I though I had wanted, and what I had been trying on in other stores. She allowed me to pick some dresses I wanted to try on and she pulled some from the back that she though would look good on me. The first dress she pulled for me was a strapless fitted lace dress...I had been looking and cowl neck chiffon dresses with dramatic backs. As soon as I got the dress on I knew it was the one. I tried on a few others but kept going back to the first dress. She let me in on the no sales tax sale that was coming up and cut me a deal on adding length to the dress...I'm 5'10 and plan on wearing heels so i needed to add 4 inches. I was happy with the price and design. She was very upfront about time line for delivery and fittings. The only down side was that I had to pay for the dress up front. I had the money in savings but would have preferred to pay a deposit until the dress was received. Follw Up*** I cannot recommend this shop enough. Bo and her staff make everyone feel comfortable and happy to be there. The dress came in months earlier than anticipated. My alterations were perfect and came in under budget. The gentleman doing the alterations offered many bustle and alteration suggestions. He also told me that if I wanted to cut down on alteration costs, where I could lose weight and where I absolutely could not lose weight. Which I thought was hilarious because lets face it, if I could chose, my tushy would be tiny. The alterations were done in a very timely manner and cost was very clearly outlined for me in advance. The dress was beautiful and fit like a glove. They also offered a recommendation for a cleaner. When I went there for my consult the woman before me had bought her dress at BoLee and also loved her dress and the shop. Very friendly and professional.

This is such a neat shop. Unlike other bridal shops which are like warehouses, this little shop has a smaller collection of gowns. But, the collection is of good taste. All of the ...

gowns are so elegant and classic. Plus, the gowns are very clean even they have been tried on by many brides to be. People in the shop are very friendly. You feel that you are treated like bride. Tea or coffee are provided for you. And there is no pressure for you to buy.
