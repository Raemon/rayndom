erything and readily available. You can truly tell she wants to create a magical day for you and cares deeply about every detail. They took great care to make sure we were fully prepared for the big day, which meant so much to us. Our photographer, Paul, was kind, funny, and down to earth. Nothing felt forced, which made a huge difference for my husband, who is a bit camera shy. Paul beautifully captured candid moments throughout the day that we will cherish forever. Everyone who sees our photos says they have never seen wedding photos like ours because they are that exquisite. The whole journey with this team was amazing. We even got our sneak peeks in under a week because we had discussed needing some early for our out-of-state reception. All our photos arrived within a couple of weeks, which felt unbelievably fast given how many stunning shots we received. If you’re looking for the best, this is it! We absolutely love this team and can’t recommend them enough.

Had an amazing time working with The Indi Collective. When we were searching for a wedding photographer, there was a certain "feel" we were looking for... photojournalistic, artsy,...

and able to capture the overall joy of the day. I didn't know exactly how to articulate that but when I saw Indi's portfolio, it felt like the right vibe. So, we about setting a meeting with Lauren, who was able to walk us through the process & logistics as well as ask us questions about what we wanted to make sure she really understood what we were looking to capture. We loved Lauren's story, artistic vision, and professionalism, so we went for it! ........................................................................ We did our engagement shoot about a year ago at Baker Beach/Legion of Honor. Though my husband and I (probably like many couples) feel awkward in front of a camera, our photographer was awesome. She helped us feel comfortable and natural while also giving us great direction on what to do. She kept the day structured and shuttled us to each location with plenty of time while also keeping things fluid enough to capture moments as they popped up organically. She also checked in with a few times to make sure we liked the direction the photos were going. A few weeks later, we got our photos back and it was exactly what we wanted - a mix of "classic" engagement photos, candid laughs, and the artsy photos we wanted but didn't know how to pose/ask for. We made a few requests on the photos which Lauren was happy to chat about and touch up before quickly getting the photos back to us. ........................................................................ About a month before the wedding, we got a form that we filled out that went over our timeline, desired shots, etc. We filled it out and then had a follow-up with our photographers, who really took the time to give us suggestions about what was realistic, shots we may want to include, and helped us prioritize what we wanted to get on wedding day. On the actual day, the photographers were incredible. On time, non-intrusive, detail-oriented, and (very!!) efficient, which helped the day go by smoothly. They were fantastic about getting all kinds of shots (especially our high priority ones) and candids, took the opportunity to take "artsy" ones as ideas popped up, and were constantly checking in to see if we wanted to try a certain shot. They made sure our family shots ran on time as well and made sure to protect my time and energy... which I didn't know to expect from my photographer but I am so, so grateful for. We had a great time with our photographers who helped keep the day running and energy levels high... we freaking adored them!........................................................................ Post-wedding, we quickly got our teasers, which we love so far. The editing is exactly what we were looking for and why we went with Indi. Overall, the process has been seamless and the communication has been prompt and informative, filled with suggestions, enthusiasm for our ideas, and thoughtfulness. Lauren and team were wonderful to work with and kept everything professional but relaxed, easy, and fun. We had the best time & cannot recommend Indi enough!! Thank you for documenting our day <3! ........................................................................ (sorry for the weird spacing, it won't let me do a paragraph break...)

As a photographer myself the first thing in my head was "WHO IS GOING TO SHOOT MY WEDDING?" I booked them before my venue and before I even knew the guest head count, haha! They ...

catered to my ridiculousness of all that, and they even did our engagement shoot as well, which resulted in them sending a photographer out cross country to meet us. Shooting with their team was just like hanging out with a best friend. They were flexible of all my oddball requests of "Please get in the aisle with us during our ceremony." and "I want to sit on the floor and chug a bottle while in my dress" and also "Let's just take candid of all our guests and let them be in the moment." They met EVERY bullet point I had for them. They're worth it!

easy to work with and made us feel comfortable and confident in our decision. Their team was professional, but also fun and warm which made our whole wedding day experience even better. They captured every moment perfectly and we can relive our special day through their stunning photos and videos. One thing that really stood out to us was their ability to capture not only the big moments but also the small details that we may have missed on our busy day. Looking back at our gallery, we are amazed at how they were able to capture the essence of our love and all the emotions of that day. Their pricing was also very fair compared to other vendors we had considered. But what truly sets them apart is their passion and dedication to their work. It's obvious that they love what they do and it reflects in the quality of their services. We highly recommend The Indi Collective for any special event, especially weddings. They will go above and beyond to make sure your memories are captured beautifully.

so fun and easy that everything just went so smoothly and stress free! They are very punctual and the service is top notch! Not only is their work amazing, but their communication, professionalism and support is fantastic. They really made the day perfect. Her work is soooo phenomenal that it was challenging to pick the pictures we wanted for our photo album. We loved and want them all! I cannot thank them enough and will surely recommend and hire them for any future phone needs. Thank you again!

The team were incredibly easy to work with and always checked into see how we were holding up even while taking photos / videos. Our guests also felt they were warm and friendly. The photos and video turned out amazing. There isn't one thing I could critique. They truly went above and beyond what was asked and I will always strongly recommend them to anyone.

professionalism, kindness, and expertise in structuring our whole timeline to give us as much time with the Indi collective team as possible, while still maintaining a good flow to the party. The day of our wedding was unfortunately the day the devastating wildfires broke out in the Los Angeles area which really threw a wrench in the works for everyone involved. Due to the fires we were very limited on places to take photos and nervously settled for a patch of trees and succulents in front of an apartment building. We rolled with it and waited for the final result, let me just say the photos are stunning and unique and more than we could have ever hoped for. Indi Collective took a terrible situation and created something beautiful out of nothing. Trust these artists, as we did, and you wont be disappointed. We will use them for every milestone in our lives and hope one day to meet Lauren in person!

My husband and I planned a destination wedding, which was so scary. We had no way to meet with our vendors in person and have that time face to face. I had spoken with several phot...

ographers and never felt a connection with any of them. Our conversations were short (maybe 15 minutes or less) and I felt like I had to lead the conversations. That was difficult since I did not know what to ask. I was so nervous that we were going to have to settle for somebody and be unhappy. When I spoke with Lauren it was completely different. We spoke for OVER an hour and I felt like I was speaking to somebody that was my best friend for years. She was informative, honest, personable and she immediately made me realize that she was "the one". I learned details about her and her personal life- which made me feel like I was more than just another client. Lauren and her team were AMAZING. We had fun, were comfortable and love the memories that we have received from them that we can look back at for the rest of our lives. I have so many good things to say that just doesn't do her any justice. I am so thankful to have found her. I am so confident that speaking with her, everybody else will have those same feelings that I did.

On the wedding day, she was punctual and professional, but again felt like one of my friends there enjoying the day with us! She was soo sweet and easy to work with. The photo process was easy and fun, everyone kept talking about how great she and her the second shooter were! On top of the wonderful experience of working with her on the wedding day, she sent us previews way sooner than I expected, and they were SO BEAUTIFUL and a perfect representation of our day!! My husband and I had a destination wedding in Hawaii and the biggest thing we wanted was for everyone to have fun, and she captured the celebration and genuine joy so perfectly!

I really can't say enough nice things about Lauren & Indi Soul. Like other photographers we interviewed, Lauren was extremely professional and asked all of the important questions...

. Like others, she also gave us a very accurate overview of how she likes to run her shoot. But she has has something extra: Lauren has a calm a friendly energy that I recognized immediately. like most brides, so I knew I wanted a photographer with a calm and professional energy who I could trust to do the job I was hoping for. She delivered just as I expect. She stay on task the whole day and evening and got all the pictures I wanted without worry. You really want things you don't have to worry about that day, it's a big plus. Most important, our needs were always top priority. Meaning that, she never got irritated when we went off script or demand to do it her way. Instead she offered us a structure of how to execute the photo in a timely manner, but was also flexible at all times. This is what I mean about being a calm energy on the big day. Some photographers gave me an impression that they like to be a drill sergeant, but Lauren and her team are a great balance of helping you stay on track but not making you feel like the world is going to end if something doesn't go your way. I guess you could say it is sort of like the royal treatment - nothing you do is wrong and she is there to support you. And don't you deserve that on your big day? I also will say, isn't the price right? I honestly feel that you get more than pay for with Lauren and Indi Soul. And everyone loves a deal. I say this because her work is beautiful and professional looking. We purchased a package with 2 photographers for eight hours and the photo book. I wanted all of the cute "getting ready" photos as well as photos lasting into the dancing hour. At the end of it all, I got every shot I wanted. So again, a great deal! Let's talk about style! Indi soul has a beautiful editorial looking style. These aren't just photos of you and your family with good lighting. They're photos that make you feel like you could be in a magazine. Which again, who doesn't want to feel like a star/queen when they get their photos back. Lastly, I had a big wish from Lauren that she totally delivered on, and you can see the photos in my post. I wanted to do a "photo shoot" with my brides maids. Not just us standing on the cliffs or in a forest, but a photo shoot with props. I wanted to look like we belonged in Vouge (Yes I am extra). I bought all the props and went to a 3rd location (besides our getting ready area and the venue). Lauren was very supportive of my vision and made it happen. You don't have to be as extra on me on your big day, and honestly you don't need to if you hire Indi Soul, but again this goes to her supportive & calm spirit. She was on board with my idea from the beginning until the end. In the end I got SO MANY gorgeous photos that I will cherish for the rest of my life. Weather your having a big, medium or even small intimate wedding, you can not go wrong with hiring Indi Soul. I wish you the best in your journey for wedding planning. And remember, you're about to declare to the world that you found someone you never want to leave your side, so rest your self! PS - My wedding is very DIY. I made all the flowers, the arch, and decorations myself. But they look professional in these pictures!! :)

ion I made throughout the entire planning process. Not only is she an incredibly talented photographer but she was a dream to work with. The day of our wedding Lauren was punctual, professional, & so much fun. My husband and I intuitively felt safe and comfortable with Lauren it felt like we were working with a friend we had known for years. Her guidance and time management were perfection we did not miss a single shot. For example, she asked us to reenact our first kiss because we were off center during the ceremony and it is our favorite photo from the day. Lauren emailed us our sneak peek within a few days after the wedding and they brought us both to tears, we seriously couldn’t be happier with the results. Lauren is a dream to work with, passionate about her photography and will exceed all your expectations.

I honestly wish there was more than five starts to rate Lauren on because I absolutely love her. I booked Lauren earlier in the year when I got engaged and got so lucky because she...

had 1 more opening for 2017. I seriously think it was a blessing that day that I had the chance to book her. Just by looking at her photography, you already know her work is amazing. But as a person, Lauren is one of the sweetest, genuine souls I have ever met. I was so incredibly happy with my engagement shoot that I couldn't wait for the wedding day to come in November for her to shoot my wedding. Photography is always hard because most couples always feel awkward at first, but not with Lauren! She made us feel so comfortable and natural that it made the experience really great. Words can't explain how thankful I am for her, because not only did I get amazing photos of the most important day of my life, but I gained a friend through the process as well. If you want a kickass photographer, book Lauren!
