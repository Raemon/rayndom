Your wife is truly spoiled—who wouldn't be with you as their partner? But that still won't stop her from window shopping at Louis Vuitton and Gucci, or savoring the scents of Chanel perfume and Diptyque candles when she visits the mall. A luxury present for your wife—whether for her birthday, the holidays or your anniversary—will make her feel even luckier to have married you. Plus, it shows that you're tuned in to her desires, not just racing to the food court every time you shop!

And sometimes, luxury can simply be a practical item that adds a touch of joy to her everyday life, like silk loungewear. Whatever path you choose, we're here to help you discover the best [gifts for your wife](https://www.theknot.com/content/romantic-gifts-for-wife), because we know what's trending, luxurious and truly worth that pretty penny.

## **Even More Luxury Gift Ideas for Your Wife**

When it comes to celebrating your wife, only the finest will do! That's why we've rounded up even more indulgent—though not necessarily expensive—presents for your wife that'll make her feel extra-special. From radiant jewelry to designer handbags to "little luxuries," each present blends opulence with quality and timeless elegance, ensuring they leave a lasting impression.

### 1\. Washable Silk Pajama Set

![Washable silk pajamas luxury gift for wife](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/ac6afb4b-0395-42d8-bd6d-11f620091e2d~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1340.1340)

_Photo: Lunya_

When you think of luxury, silk often comes to mind—but it's usually accompanied by the idea of high maintenance, making it feel less worth the investment. It's time to change that perception! Lunya's washable silk offers all the softness and breathability you expect, but with the added benefit of being machine washable (on the cold cycle, that is). This luxe pajama set is perfect for your wife, allowing her to revel in the elegance and comfort of silk without the hassle. It features a generously oversized top with a pocket and a stylish high-low hem, paired with side-slit pants that offer ease of movement and ventilation—ideal for weekend lounging or settling in for a restful night's sleep.

You know what they say: the longer the burn time, the longer the love lasts—so add that nearly-52 ounce candle to your cart! But seriously, when it comes to Diptyque candles, it's truly the scent that matters. Their bestselling Baies fragrance blends the fresh, fruity notes of blackcurrant with the delicate essence of rose, enveloping any space in captivating warmth.
