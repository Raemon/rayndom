I want to preface this by saying that Bloomsters may be a great fit for many — they came highly recommended by our venue, and their work clearly resonates with a lot of clients. Un...

fortunately, I learned the hard way that they just weren’t the right fit for our themed wedding reception. Looking back, I ignored some personal red flags because I trusted the venue’s recommendation. That’s on me — I should have done more due diligence. Communication and creative alignment are really important, especially when you're planning something specific and meaningful like a themed event. In our case, things didn’t align in a way that gave me confidence moving forward. When I ultimately chose not to proceed with them, they retained half of our $6,000 deposit — $3,000 — despite having an entire month to rebook the date. I understand the business side of contracts, but it was a painful financial loss for something that never came to fruition. If you’re considering Bloomsters, my advice is this: don’t skip the step of making sure they’re the right match for your vision and style. Recommendations are helpful, but chemistry and clear communication are essential. I share this only to help others avoid making the same mistake I did.

Bloomster's caught my eye when I was searching for a florist, as they had photos of weddings they had done previously at our venue. I sent an inquiry and received a very prompt rep...

ly from Jamie, their Marketing Manager & Event Coordinator. We scheduled a call and I got such a good vibe from her! I was so impressed at the questions she asked to determine what kind of look we were going for, especially since, until being on that call, *I* didn't even know what look I was going for (plus my knowledge of the different flower names is woefully pathetic). After receiving a quote from her with all of the things we had discussed, we immediately decided to hire Bloomster's for our wedding. We never even bothered contacting any other florists, as we felt we'd already found the right one. Working with Jamie throughout the process was a pleasure. She was always prompt with responding to emails, very considerate of our budget and keeping our costs down, and was a delight in-person when we met for our mock up appointment a couple of months before the wedding. On our wedding day, all of our florals (i.e., centerpieces, bouquets, boutonnieres) were even more beautiful than we had envisioned. We received so many compliments on the bouquets especially, and we could not have been happier with how they all turned out. The person who delivered our florals was also incredibly sweet, and seemed so thrilled that I loved my bouquet so much! I highly recommend Bloomster’s. They do absolutely beautiful work, truly listen to their customers, and were a pleasure to work with from start to finish.

I was on the fence on a bridal bouquet, but on the day of I could not take my eyes off the bouquet they created for me - it was amazing. On top of that the team handcrafted our wedding floral crowns which held a lot of meaning for our ceremony and were perfectly created to match our needs and vision. They were a centerpiece of the ceremony and truly reflected the spiritual gifts were were giving to each other. It was a pleasure working with them and their flowers are the absolute best.

th that being said, on my actual wedding day I didn’t receive the correct flowers in my bouquets as well as the boutonnières. Also, my bouquet was supposed to “cascade downward with lots of green eucalyptus” (how they worded it on the contract utilizing the inspiration pictures I sent them)- I had the opposite- I had a tall, awkward bouquet with the wrong flowers and no eucalyptus. I was upset but I handled it like every other corona bride would... winged it. They rearranged it for me quickly and sadly it looked like flowers you could get at Safeway. I also ordered rose petals for the aisle and the path was very very scantly lined with rose petals. After informing them of the fall outs, I was given 250$ back and told I should have been “communicated with” regarding my main flowers not being available for my wedding. Sorry bloomsters, really wanted to love you, but I just wasn’t happy.

d Elizabeth came up with exceeded our expectations in every way. We told them our initial ideas and budget, and they produced such sensational designs that we knew these guys were something REALLY special. They made several suggestions to help stretch our budget (like smartly repurposing ceremony flowers for the reception). They took an abstract idea like "Cuban Colonial" and blew us away with designs that were on budget and complimented the venue's architecture. Our guests were totally WOWED. We even had a crazy idea to have custom floral lapel wraps for our suits instead of traditional boutonnieres. Kren didn't bat an eye at the weird request. In fact, he came up with a design that was not only gorgeous, but ingenious in its construction (Magnets instead of pins! No holes in our suits!). Every aspect of our experience was delightful. From planning and design, to delivery/setup and breakdown, the Bloomster's team was exceptional. Our wedding was the best, most magical day of my life, and a huge part of that is credited to Bloomster's. These professionals are the best and I can't recommend them highly enough! Thank you Bloomster's!

They provided the most spectacular color pallet of fresh flowers that were romantic, soft, and everything I could have hoped for in wedding flowers. They decorated the archway that complemented the venue and scenery perfectly and they transitioned the flowers from ceremony to reception without anyone noticing. Their service and customer support from first discussion through cleanup afterwards was beyond what I could have asked for in a vendor. I highly recommend them and believe they are worth every penny.

Everything we wanted, and more! We set up our initial consultation with Kren and fell in love with his artistic vision and creativity! We showed up mentioning we didn't really like...

traditional bridal bouquets, floral centerpieces, or simply too many flowers. We knew we liked succulents, copper wire, unique accents, and bright flowers. Kren started sharing all sorts of fun ideas even bringing flowers into our discussion and sketching. We were so captivated by his excitement and willingness to work with us outside of the box. We left feeling excited for our floral and decor transformation Kren and his team were going to create. They were also great at working with our budget and shared a very detailed proposal. We shared details and photos (dresses, shoes, accents, etc.) through our planning with Kren and his team to help them with the overall vision. We had our final consult with a sample mock-up a couple weeks before our wedding and left so excited for our wedding day! Our wedding day was perfect! The guys magnetic boutonnieres were small succulents with bright berries wrapped in copper wire. The aisle pieces (later moved inside) were gorgeous and so different! The cascading entrance pieces on top of wine barrells had all sorts of textural elements including artichokes and moss. The girls' flowers were prettier than anything we had seen and so unique all wrapped in copper wire. The arrangements had fun textural pieces along with succulents. The bridal bouquet looked like a single large composite flower made of individual petals from other flowers to create a beautiful ombre effect. The reception space was even transformed with bistro lights added over the dance floor. The centerpieces on all our reception tables varied but all tied together with loose textural elements and wood slabs some were set on. It was all so uniquely different and pretty! Better than we ever could have imagined! We couldn't have been happier having chose to work with Bloomster's for our wedding day! And would recommend Kren and his team to anyone, no matter what their vision!
