We hired Bella Bridal for bride, 3 bridesmaids, and mother of the bride. The highlight of the hair/makeup process was hands down when we handed my mom a mirror after her makeup tri...

al, and she started crying saying she hadn’t felt so beautiful in a long time. I can’t imagine not doing the trial, despite the extra cost, as we tweaked almost everything about my makeup after that process. I had a very tough time picking a hair/makeup vendor - as someone who used to do my own full face of makeup each day, but recently developed skin sensitivities, my headspace is complex and I came in with worries about reacting to products. I have mixed feelings overall, as a clean updo was important, but a bit of my low bun fell down. Overall, I think they delivered what they promised, which is a very natural “no-makeup” look. The subtle fake lashes were probably my favorite - they looked so real and lasted well all day. Remember to provide your own lip color for reapplications throughout the day.

Jocelyn did my wedding on 7/21/24. She was AMAZING. I hired her with no trial, and she was able to flex her schedule to remain in CA for my wedding. She took my inspiration picture...

and executed it FLAWLESSLY. Moreover, nothing moved all night which was seriously insane. My super breakout prone skin DID NOT breakout from any of her products. Additionally, she worked with my mom who normally barely wears any makeup, and wow! My mom was so impressed. We all looked like the absolute best versions of ourselves all night long, and I cannot explain just how amazing Jocelyn is.

olutely amazing. Everyone felt and looked stunning and the makeup and hair was just what we wanted for my evening black tie wedding. Doing the trial was really helpful as there were some changes I wanted to see from the trial (Bella Bridal airs on the side of more natural makeup and I wanted it a little less natural for an evening black tie wedding. I also wanted the hairstyle a bit more classic than boho) they were SUPER receptive to all feedback, and it was obvious they were genuinely invested in making me feel confident, happy, and beautiful on my big day. It was so important to me that not only I felt really beautiful, but my ladies did as well. The makeup and hair held strong through the night (without ever feeling heavy) and lasted through tears and a rager of a dance party. I can't say enough positive things about Jenna, Lillia, and Rhea (as well as working with Bella Bridal!). Including some photos below (photography credit: Ryan Greenleaf Photography)

hiring a team like Bella versus going with one-off hair/make-up artists - it’s 100% worth the money! The team was professional, punctual, and ready to get to work. I worked with Ashlee and I was so happy with how my bridal look turned out! Every time I saw a photo of myself I would say "Look how good I look!!" I felt so beautiful and I still looked perfect by the end of the night. My bridesmaids and our moms, done by Rhea, looked stunning. Everyone looked polished throughout the entire night - even after dancing for several hours. My wedding day was truly the best day of my life and I could not be more grateful for Bella’s help in making us all look so fabulous. I highly recommend Bella Bridal!

I had the pleasure of working with Ashlee! We first met for a makeup trial. I had no specific requirements and wanted to explore soft nude/natural matte colors while still looking ...

and feeling like myself. And just like that, Ashlee created a beautiful, natural makeup look with soft taupes, pinks and browns. On the day of the wedding, Ashlee was attentive to myself, my mother and mother-in-law with all our getting ready looks. She adjusted as needed and her artistic abilities had my mothers feeling gorgeous and pampered. So glad we had Ashlee there to celebrate with us as we got ready!

utbreak on their team. They were kind enough to connect me with Bella Bridal who was thankfully still available for our date! Jocelyn quickly got our contract set up and scheduled a trial for me with Ashlee. The trial was impeccable and on the actual day, the hair and makeup for me, my bridesmaids, my mom and mother-in-law all turned out BEAUTIFULLY. I always say that wedding beauty can be hit or miss (I've been in a few bridal parties where it's been a miss!), but Bella Bridal is a HIT. They are organized, prompt, and do beautiful hair and makeup! If they're available for your date, book them!

Bella Bridal is really good at what they do. Being a wedding planner and a recent bride, I have worked with them as a vendor and a client. First off, I loved my hair and makeup on ...

my wedding day. Jocelyn immediately got my vibe and nailed it. She's so easy to be around, I felt so comfortable and knew I was in good hands. They are also very organized on the planning side. They provide a timeline/beauty schedule, which not all stylists do. It's so helpful to make sure your wedding prep stays on track, as I assure you that you don't want to start your day behind schedule. I truly can't recommend Bella Bridal enough! They are wonderful!

Buyer Beware We had to cancel our wedding on May 16 due to corona..these horrible people refused to refund our money..make sure you have an exit clause in your contract

Jocelyn is one of our favorite hair and make-up artists of all time. Her work speaks for itself in images and video but what you don't get to see until you meet her is how amazing ...

she is in person. She's personable, joyful, and brings such a positive energy to her couples. We are a wedding photography and videography couple team based in Austin, Texas and had the pleasure of collaborating with Jocelyn. We definitely hope to work with her again and will highly recommend her to any client of ours in need of her services.

It set the bar high for what was going to be a fabulous day.

Very great team and we are already referring them to friends and family who have upcoming weddings in the area!

akeup done. After doing much research, I decided on Bella Bridal because of the large team that Jocelyn manages so that we weren't tight on time day of. Jocelyn and team were prompt, ran on schedule (even early!) and were flexible. Jocelyn herself is an incredible talent - she knows how to take your vision and make it come to life, and is never too proud to make corrections when you change your mind on something. She is also a blast to hang out with and is super accommodating. All to say, day of, I felt like a princess and all of my girls looked great too. I'd highly recommend Bella Bridal if you're looking for a professional, dependable service!

f people and their professionalism, down to earth personalities made it so fun to have them as part of our morning getting ready process on such a special day. Each artist asked myself and my girls what we had in mind for our looks at their time of service. They absolutely hit it out of the park in giving them the look they wanted while also maintaining a soft consistency to our theme of romantic, timeless and classic. Our hair and makeup lasted ALL DAY long and through the end of the night. No touch ups needed, which is a miracle in itself considering it was very warm out. I haven't received my professional photos back yet, but I am so excited to receive them and see how amazing our hair and makeup looks. In a standard iPhone photo, each of us looks so stunningly gorgeous and seriously radiant. No oily, greasy, over-makeup-ed girls. Just beautiful classic elegance. Words cannot express my gratitude to these talented and lovely group of women who made my special day even more special by making us feel and look so gorgeous. I'm adopting them all into my extended family! That's how much I love them :)

I had so many people (other vendors) complimenting the job that she did as we were getting ready before the wedding, and these are people who work in weddings every day so they know their stuff. Everyone in the wedding party who got their makeup done was so happy with the results. She listened to them and gave them just what they requested. She was wonderful.

Jocelyn and the Bella Bridal team did a wonderful job for our wedding. Often, I feel that wedding updos are over-the-top and look nothing like what you want, so I was amazed at th...

e work she did on my hair and on my bridesmaids. The looks were natural, beautiful, and very close to the pictures we showed her. My mom never gets her makeup done. Ever. Every time she's tried, she hates it. She's taking it off immediately after getting it done, so now she just doesn't do it. After seeing my makeup trial with Jocelyn, however, my mom decided to have Jocelyn do her makeup for my wedding. She loved it! It is the first time I have known my mom to get her makeup done professionally and like the way she looked. Jocelyn is fun, easy, and will make you laugh - exactly what you need on the big day! But more than that, she will make you look like the best version of yourself. She brings out your natural beauty so you still look like you - just more gorgeous! We had a destination wedding in Napa and since we live in Australia, I had to communicate with her strictly via e-mail. Jocelyn was very good about e-mailing me back and was very punctual with her replies. She fit me in for a preview when I was in Napa for just a couple of days a few months before the wedding. Some of the hair and makeup artists I contacted were extravagently priced but Bella Bridal is very reasonable. I would definitely recommend the Bella Bridal team!

I contacted Jocelyn Gomez of Bella Bridal based on reviews I had read online. I was planning a wedding in the Napa Valley and I am currently living in southern California. Right aw...

ay Jocelyn was able to answer all my questions, give me a quote on services and let me know which weekends were available. Luckily she still had my wedding date free! I was able to easily schedule my trial day and services for my bridesmaids and mother of the bride. Jocelyn put me at ease during our trial and basically read my mind! I showed her a few pictures of the front and backs of hair, described that I would like a natural makeup look and within an hour or so I had my bridal look and loved it!! Jocelyn made me feel comfortable and I really looked forward to the day. Sure enough, the morning of the wedding had me laughing and Jocelyn did an amazing job on the bridesmaids hair, my mom felt absolutely beautiful with her makeup and I felt like a million bucks. I could not thank Jocelyn enough for the quality of her service and the morning of my wedding memories. I know her team is a group of talented girls- Jocelyn is a hard worker and wouldn't put together any team but a good one! I can't wait for an excuse to get my makeup and/or hair done again!

When I first contacted Jocelyn, she seemed very enthusiastic and excited about the services I requested (hair + make-up for the bride & hair for matron of honor and mother of the b...

ride). She promptly sent over the contract and list of prices -- everything was off to a great start! I also began sending pictures of the looks I was going for, to which she did note & respond well. The day of the wedding is when issues arose. Her overall attitude was not the same as she had portrayed through her e-mail messages. And although her boutique salon was adorably decorated, she approached the morning with a very unaccommodating & sullen attitude. The biggest piece of advice I can give to brides that book Bella Bridal is show up with 100% dry hair -- as there are ZERO hair dryers on the premise. My mother and I made this mistake, which left us frantically searching for one around St. Helena at 8 in the morning -- of course, running out of precious time to get finish getting ready for the wedding. It does state in the initial contract to arrive with "clean, dry hair". DO IT. And don't expect any helpful customer service practices from this establishment. As this was the kick-off to my wedding day, it left me very disappointed and regretting my decision to book this particular hair & make-up salon. Overall: Her customer service practices left a lot to be desired. Wedding days should be filled with joyous & pleasant people -- no grumpy cats allowed.

The service at Bella Bridal is deplorable. Jocelyn was the only person present to assist us and her attitude was very unpleasant and depressing to be around the morning of a weddi...

ng!! When we arrived with damp hair we were sullenly informed that she does not keep a hair dryer on the premises (a beauty salon with no hair dryer!) and that we could run to Safeway and buy one. She she said "this was stated in the contract." Actually, the contract does state to arrive with clean, dry hair, so the lesson is don't expect this salon to accomplish any style that would require the use of a basic blow dryer. I told her she didn't have to do my hair as it didn't appear she could give me the casual blow out I wanted and again she referred her to her contract by telling me that I would have to pay for her services even if I didn't use them since that "was in the contract." A short time later she informed me she didn't have time to do my hair so apparently she can break the contract on her whim-the contract is only valid when it benefits her. Beware of this contract. She did not do my hair and after I attempted as best I could to do my own hair with my own tools (after running around St Helena frantically looking for a hair dryer-they do not stock them at Safeway) and I asked her how it looked-her response to was to give me a little "snort" of disapproval. My daughter (whose hair she did manage to find time to actually style) picked up some hairspray to spray the updo, and Jocelyn quickly told her to put it down. She is not generous or even adequate with space, supplies, services, or pleasantries. She is also expensive and not worth near what she charges.

Nikole Frey of Bella Bridal did a wonderful job for our wedding. I first met here when I did my trial hair and makeup. She definitely understands beauty and gives you exactly what ...

you want. She is not going to give you heavy makeup if you want light. During my trial appointment, she made some suggestions outside my normal beauty regiment. It was great to be able to try them out then and decide whether I liked the idea. I discovered that I liked adding a few eyelashes to fill mine in. The day of the wedding, Nikole came to our hotel to do hair and makeup for my group of girls. She did hair and makeup for me and my mother, and hair for my 3 bridesmaids. It all looked gorgeous. When I finally saw myself completely done, I felt like a bride. Whether I was or not, I felt the most beautiful I have ever been, and that is how any girls wants to feel on her wedding day. I definitely recommend Nikole and Bella Bridal to any bride.
