had soooooo many questions and they were answered thoughtfully and promptly and even though I started like every email with "sorry for another question" (lol) I never felt like it was a bother. Everything is sooooo streamlined and easy. We booked about a year and half out and they provided an awesome timeline and everything went according to plan! They were able to make our wedding an absolute dream :). And obviously the venue is GORGEOUS!!! I hate the heat so we knew we wanted all indoors; I also didn't like the idea of "flipping the space" between ceremony and reception so I loved that they had an indoor ceremony space (amber room) and then the ballroom for reception...AND the garden for cocktail hour- it was exactly what we envisioned.

They anticipated our needs before we even realized them, and their service was seamless from start to finish. Communication was always prompt and reliable, which gave us such peace of mind leading up to the big day. We especially want to recognize our event manager, Tammy Cheung, who was truly EXCEPTIONAL. Tammy is calm, efficient, and incredibly organized, exactly the kind of person you want guiding you through wedding planning. She answered all of our questions with patience and clarity, kept us on track, and made sure every detail was accounted for. On the wedding day, her professionalism and steady presence ensured everything ran smoothly, allowing us to simply enjoy ourselves. We are so grateful to Tammy and the entire Casa Real team for making our wedding an unforgettable experience.

Casa Real was truly my dream wedding venue. We spent so much time researching hundreds of venues — both local and destination — and ultimately chose Casa Real for its convenience, ...

but more importantly, because I completely fell in love with it the moment we toured. The venue itself is absolutely stunning, but what truly sets Casa Real apart is their incredible team. We worked with Jolyne as our day-of coordinator, and she was fantastic — super organized, responsive, and made sure all the little details were figured out well in advance so we could relax and enjoy our day. The food was another highlight! We did a tasting about six months before the wedding, and everything was amazing — from the appetizers to the entrées to the mini desserts. Our guests are still raving about how good the food was. We had about 140 guests, and the space was perfect — elegant, comfortable, and so well thought out. From start to finish, the entire experience with Casa Real exceeded our expectations. I'm so glad we booked with them, and if you're considering it — you will be too!

h search in Napa and Sonoma County, we definitely saved the best for last with Casa Real! It was the last venue we looked at and as soon as we stepped into the entrance hall we knew it was the one! From the gorgeous venue and grounds, the delicious food, to the amazing Casa Real team, everything was perfect! It was such a joy working with Amanda, Kara, Jennifer, and Kelsea as they were all so kind and helpful and made sure that every step of the planning process was stress free! Everything was so effortless and exceeded all of our expectations on our big day and we couldn’t be happier! Our family and friends spoke so highly of the service, professionalism, accommodations, and of course the food! Our wedding day truly was perfect and we can’t thank the Casa Real team enough for making our vision come to life!

My fiance and I were married last month at Casa and it was amazing! Virginia and Kara, and all of the staff were amazing since the moment we first went to tour the venue about 8 m...

onths before our big date. They were all so extremely professional, kind, responsive and very helpful in our planning throughout. Casa offers everything included, or you can further personalize. We chose to use everything that is provided (white linens, chairs, china, etc). We were not disappointed. Everything looked so elegant. And the food - the food was amazing. All of our guests raved about how delicious the food was (we offered our guests a choice of chicken gruyere as well as the filet mignon). They also accommodated several people with multiple allergies (we were told by the guests that the chef came out and directly spoke with them to walk through the ingredients). This and other personal touches throughout the night helped make our night so memorable. It is a beautiful venue with lots of options! I was very concerned at first on how such a large space could accommodate my relatively small wedding of 93 people. But it worked perfect! We chose to have an ivory curtain that blocked off the cocktail hour inside, but it would have been fine without. The vineyards were perfect for sunset photos. We really can't say enough good things about this place. We highly recommend having your wedding here especially if (like us) you want/need the extra help in planning your day. They treated us wonderfully. We loved how we were able to enjoy cocktail hour while taking photos. There were two servers that accompanied us during pictures with a cart food of food and drinks - such an awesome touch! Having a day- of coordinator was another great part of Casa's wedding package. We loved how we were just able to show up and enjoy our wedding! The staff made it about as stress free as a wedding could possibly be. Our wedding was on a Thursday evening which offers a discounted rate - it was a fantastic value for what we got. We highly recommend Casa!

y details that go into planning a wedding, but Kelsea and others at Casa Real helped so much with that. They were always so easy to get a hold of, and they were beyond kind, warm, reassuring, and patient. When we first went to look at this venue, something just felt right about it, and when we decided to book it, there was no feeling of doubt that we made the best choice. Everything about that day felt perfect and seamless - the ceremony, cocktail hour, the drinks, the food… just everything. Everyone who worked with us that day made it so special for us and all of our guests. There really is magic in being a Casa Real couple, and we cannot recommend it enough. We are so grateful to Kelsea and everyone else there, and we are so unbelievably happy we chose this place 🤍 \- Mimi & Mauricio

First, if you are newly engaged, congratulations! Second, if you are in the process of looking for a wedding venue, there is NO need to look any further because Casa Real will help...

you plan the wedding of your dreams! Not only is this place beautiful as it is (which means you won’t have to spend a ton on decorations and flowers), but it has the BEST TEAM in the wedding industry! When my now husband and I were researching venues for our wedding, we came across Casa Real and immediately fell in love. Our goal was to find an all-inclusive venue that included everything you could think of from a day of coordinator to a fully open bar to furniture/linens/china, glassware, and flatware, a dressing suite, a suggested vendor list, and most importantly, we wanted a venue with delicious food and Casa Real offered all the above. Although, at the time our budget couldn’t quite afford it, we kept Casa Real as our #1 choice while we looked at other venues. We waited to visit Casa Real in person to rule out any other possible venues first, but once we saw it in person, we knew we were going to make our budget work! Tammy and August were our first contacts and they assisted us with scheduling an in person visit as well as choosing a date that worked within our budget. We chose non-peak season (March 2024) and although it rained on our wedding day, we didn’t have to worry about it since our ceremony & reception were indoors. Once we chose the date, it was time to get to work! At first, I was a bit hesitant about not hiring a wedding planner, but I quickly became confident that Casa Real would take care of us the day of as they were extremely responsive and helpful throughout the whole process, from start to finish. Any questions I had were answered promptly from one of the team members and they were amazing enough to also suggest ideas when I needed it. Some may think “too many hands in the cookie jar” might mess things up, but this team is so on top off it! I never felt like anything was missed or forgotten! The communication and strong attention to details within this team is incredible! We saw firsthand how amazing this group is when we attended our menu tasting. It was like watching superheroes in action. We were assigned a coordinator about 6 weeks out from our wedding and although it was short lived, Julia was great and assured us that her replacement would take care of us and sure enough, she was right! Kara, Jennie, and Casey came together as a team to ensure the last few months of wedding planning was smooth for us and we had the utmost confidence that they would make our wedding vision come to life! We couldn’t have asked for a better team of people to help make our big day so memorable! Our guests are still talking about how delicious the food was, how beautiful the decorations were, and how detailed everything was. Casa Real will always hold a special place in our hearts!

Casa Real's team goes above and beyond to ensure that couples are prepared, organized, and ready for a seamless event. I worked with Jenny and Haley the day of the event and they were amazing. Very professional with a can-do attitude despite some small things going awry. To top it all off, the venue is stunning. I HIGHLY recommend hosting your wedding or upcoming event at Casa Real.

o kind and answered all questions from my family. We had August as our coordinator and she was absolutely AMAZING. We had zoom calls before the wedding and she helped immensely by helping us make decisions, giving us friendly reminders, giving advice if we were not sure on anything, and she went above and beyond. I ended up forgetting to email her 2 documents the day before the wedding, and we ended up just filling out the paperwork at the rehearsal, super easy and oops on my end! We also had an issue with our transportation (not the venue's fault) and August stepped right in so I didn't have to. We had to shift some things around because of that, but August kept us informed if needed. She ensured we ate dinner, had appetizers, had drinks, and just went above and beyond. Even some of the guests were telling me how amazing she was! I also wanted to give a shout out to all their other staff as well. If I had simple questions, someone always answered the phone, answered my questions, and always sent me a follow up email so the conversation had a paper trail. Kara was also wonderful. She was also very patient with all questions my mom had and just such a sweet woman. All staff members are amazing, the venue itself is gorgeous, the food was delicious (we had the chicken with the cheese cream sauce and the pork shoulder) and we could not have asked for a better experience with Casa Real. Look no further for booking your wedding venue. It is 1000% worth it!

My husband and I had the most magical wedding thanks to the Casa Real venue and staff. Our experience working with the Casa Real staff was nothing short of exceptional from start t...

o finish. We were married in the lush Sun Garden that included a fountain and leafy green arbor (no flower arch necessary!), but if the weather had been bad, we had peace of mind knowing we could transition to an indoor ceremony in the warm, romantic light of the Amber Room. The venue also includes a bridal dressing room, spacious Reception Hall, and lovely Entrance Hall. Venue aside, the staff at Casa Real are true professionals. My husband and I felt well-supported throughout our wedding planning process, with prompt responses from the staff no matter how small the question. We thoroughly enjoyed the complimentary food tasting that's included when booking a wedding, and had a difficult time selecting our entrée courses - the food is SO delicious! Special shout-out to August Yocher who was our assigned Event Coordinator in the months leading up to our wedding and who directed our wedding weekend. August is detail-oriented, knowledgeable, kind, and overall a pleasure to work with! She handled so many logistics and details pertaining to the wedding, but most importantly she removed the stress from our wedding weekend. She's fantastic! Thank you August and Casa Real! We couldn't recommend this venue more highly.

modated our requests and answered any questions we had in a timely manner. In the months leading up to our wedding, they were always assist in any way they could, even if it was just general wedding planning questions we weren't sure of. Our day of coordinator, Alyssa, was in constant contact with us and made sure we had everything we needed to have a successful wedding. Their flexibility and generous hospitality really allowed us to have a stress free day. My husband and I didn't have to worry about little details like figuring our who would cue the DJ or ensuring the decorator re-purposed the flowers correctly, or coordinating the first look, etc. Our favorite thing about Casa is definitely their customer service. The food and drinks exceeded our expectations too. We were planning a fusion wedding so majority of our guests were Indian. Since we had Indian food catered for our Hindu wedding and other pre-wedding events leading up to the Christian ceremony, we decided to go with the in-house catering offered by Casa Real. We heard only good things about the chef's choice vegan/veggie option. In fact, during the tasting, my parents asked the chef if the dish could be made a little more spicy and they were so kind to accommodate the request. The Cuban sandwiches and the bacon wrapped dates were also amazing during the cocktail hour. They also allowed us to add appetizers from an outside caterer to their passed apps. The caterer just dropped off the food and Casa's team took care of passing them out with the other apps. The drinks were perfect as well. On top of having a full bar and the option to select his/her drinks, they have their signature cocktail menu that guests can pick from. Our wedding was just around 200 guests so the venue comfortably fit everyone. We loved that guests were able to flow from room to room (amber room, entrance hall, sun garden) so it definitely didn't feel too crowded at any given moment. It does seem like a pricey venue when you first see the costs, but keep in mind there are a lot of items included with that price. The most important thing to us for our wedding was for our guests to have a good time with dinner, drinks, and dancing. To be able to make Casa fit in our budget, we decided to go with the base package for pretty much everything they offered (linens, chairs, etc) and it worked perfect for us. The venue itself is already so beautiful that we didn't feel we had to add much more décor. We had an alter arch, aisle florals and a floral piece for the entrance table and a few other personal touches for the entrance hall. And with their complimentary floating candles, it tied everything together perfectly for us. The only downside to this is that the venue has a strict end time of 10pm due to the city laws. It's out of their control, but we wish the venue could be available past 10pm. Looking back, we are so happy we chose Casa Real. Their amazing customer service and convenience of having a lot in house made the whole planning process easier and the event itself so memorable.

Casa Real made all of our wedding dreams come true! It is a challenge to write a review that is not pages long, because there are so many amazing things to say about the Casa Real ...

office team, event planning team, day-of staff, venue, food…. From the first day we toured the property, my parents and husband and I were sold on this venue. It was apparent right away that the team is full of experts who know about every detail that goes in to a wedding, and if you don’t have the answer they are ready to guide you with options and recommendations. We felt like we were in such great hands with Kara and Antonella during the planning phase, and I cannot give high enough praise for Kelsea. Kelsea was our day-of coordinator, and all of my wedding party and family agreed she was a STAR throughout the day. She was so sweet and fun with our wedding party during the rehearsal, and everyone felt so comfortable with her on the day of the wedding. She was so good at checking in with us and our parents throughout the night. We did not hire a wedding planner, but we always felt like we had one with Casa running point. The day of our wedding ran so smoothly and we even were ahead of schedule at some points. Our day felt fun and exciting and EASY, and I attribute all of that to Casa’s expert team handling everything in the background. Casa’s preferred vendor list is top-notch and well curated so that they can recommend the best vendors in the area who are also all well-acquainted with each other. Every vendor we worked with was so complimentary of Casa Real and the work they do, and we couldn’t agree more. In addition to the impeccably appointed property (the foyer, sun garden, amber room, and grand salon are stunning even without wedding decor), one other standout from our wedding is easily the FOOD. From the snacks in the bridal suite, to the cocktail hour appetizers, to the generous and delicious entrees, to our late night donuts and french fries, to the well-stocked (and beautiful) bar, I was so proud that all of our wedding food was DELICIOUS. (One note in particular: we had multiple guests tell us this was by far the best vegetarian meal they had ever had at any wedding!) Everything about Casa Real deserves five stars - I am so thankful to their whole team!

, starting with @karaandrews and @alyssastewart, who were willing to listen to and make specific requests happen! the transition from the Amber room to the ballroom was seamless never saw any movement from the staff. It just happened behind the scenes. Now, regarding the MENU, the CHEFS and the staff hit it out of the park! Our guests, a week later, are still calling to tell us how great each food choice was. From the appetizers to the display tables, main entree, late-night snacks, and our Donut Flambee bar! HIGHLY recommend Casa Real @beetscatering for your next event, no matter the occasion.

e on site for an in-person tour, the venue exceeded our expectations and we selected Casa Real as our wedding venue without hesitation! We chose are venue in April 2021 and got married in September 2022. Though the venue is breathtaking in itself, the support and level of organization and detail from the staff is exemplary! Our wedding date was nearly a year and a half away, and Kara was extremely responsive, patient, and always kind in answering any questions that we had. We met with our assigned coordinator, Alyssa, three months prior to our wedding date, and feel that she played such a pivotal role in the ease that we felt leading up to and on our wedding day. She was very attentive to our vision and made sure to honor and highlight various aspects of our wedding that we asked for. Alyssa ran our rehearsal efficiently. On the day of our wedding, my husband and I were able to just relax and stay present, as Alyssa took care of all of the details and frequently checked in with us to make sure we were eating enough and were hydrated; she pivoted when necessary to make sure we had enough time to eat, which we were so grateful for. Some of our vendors also commented on how impressed they were with the quality of Alyssa's work as our coordinator. The venue staff were amazing and were so kind to us and our guests. Our guests raved about the appetizers and dinner; many mentioned that this was the best wedding food they've had! We cannot thank the Casa Real staff enough for making our wedding day so magical!

I have so many good things to say about Casa Real, I don’t know where to start! When my husband and I were touring venues, Casa Real immediately stood out to us because of how beau...

tiful it was - it’s a lovely villa nestled in a field of vineyards - but also because of the professionalism and knowledge of the staff. After booking them, so many of our other vendors expressed how much they liked working with Casa Real - “They are such a well-oiled machined”, “They are so on top of things that if anything went wrong, you would never know”, “You can’t do better than Casa Real for a wedding venue in this area” are so of the comments we heard, and we couldn’t agree more. Tammy, our dedicated Casa Real wedding coordinator, did an excellent job in walking us through the planning process during our meetings. She is dedicated, hard-working, and so pleasant to work with. She, Kara, and the rest of the Casa Real staff were so kind, friendly, and very available by phone and email to answer our questions. We also loved the option of having the ceremony in either the Amber Room or the Sun Garden - this is REALLY important for this area. Especially with summer weddings, you never know if there will be California fires or 100+ F weather, so it’s so beneficial to have the option of switching indoors. We actually ended up switching the ceremony location a few days before because of inclement weather. The day of our wedding was a dream come true - everything ran so seamlessly, smoothly, and on time due to Casa Real’s expertise and careful planning. I HIGHLY recommend them if you’re looking for a wedding venue.

Is it possible to pull off a really memorable wedding reception with everything you want with 3 months notice? I can proudly say with Casa Real it is. There are no weaknesses in th...

e armor of this comprehensive venue and the strengths are in its tight coordination of excellent staff. They are able to pull off very specific preferences as well as autopilot you to a coherent experience. Because of our tight deadline we were constantly on the ropes but Antonella and Kara made sure we were on time and everything fit together. The day of reception Antonella was our captain and expertly sailed us through the evening seamlessly and over bumps in our packed schedule smoothly. The stealth army-like staff was amazing and we felt like VIPs. My pickiest foodie friends were very happy and my booziest friends were too happy. We picked the boba bar as an add on and I think my boba fans had 5 each. And lastly it’s hard to forget that the grounds are impeccable and beautiful and feel like you are at a wine country resort. We feel incredibly lucky that we were able to find Casa Real at all but doubly so on short notice. Lastly I can see why these preferred vendors are preferred. Nicole Ha (florist), Bev Tanaka (cake design), DJ Rick/Amos Productions (DJ and photobooth), Courtyard Livermore (hotel and shuttle), and Phoenix Wang (photographer, not preferred yet but should be) were heroes assembling to make everything just work without a fuss. I am so grateful to these super wedding professionals and their seamless coordination with Casa Real needing only the absolute minimum essential input from us. They are collectively what made a 3 month prep wedding possible and I did not feel the need for an additional wedding planner. If I was sent back in time I’d definitely do it with Casa Real again.

Casa to a Saturday in June 2021 and again to a Saturday in July 2022 with absolutely no trouble at all. The staff at Casa were extremely accommodating and understanding throughout the entire process. All members of the Casa team we encountered were extremely responsive, helpful, and organized. We had not hired a wedding planner and planned everything ourselves. In fact, when I had reached out to several wedding planners, a couple had suggested we actually don't use their services since Casa has it under control! The Casa team made this process seamless for us. We worked with Antonella as our day of coordinator and she was super sweet, eager to help, and closely assisted in keeping the entire day on track. Overall, you cannot go wrong with Casa. They do everything right - the food, the drinks, the value. They make it so easy to focus on what is truly important that day.

including preparation, the three-course meal, the open bar, the venue layout, the event execution, etc. seemed to go exactly as planned with very little effort the day of the wedding. I can go on about every little detail for Casa Real, but ultimately I think it comes down to one of Genevieve's last statements to us before the big day. She told us that our only job the day of the wedding was to relax and enjoy the celebration. Casa Real easily deserves 5 stars because they allowed us to do just that, and we truly got to enjoy our reception thanks to their hard working, organized, professional, and personable team.

Casa Real was the perfect venue for our ~300 person Indian wedding this past May - and we cannot say enough positive things about our experience there. To start with the venue: 1....

It is gorgeous, both indoors and outdoors. Each room has architectural and furniture details that add character, and the outdoor spaces are tastefully landscaped. When all of these spaces are opened up (for example, during a reception), it gives guests plenty of options to mingle and roam per their needs. 2\. It has a number of different areas that can accommodate multiple different potential flows for your event and large groups of people without feeling intimidating or claustrophobic. For us, having different areas to do the Baraat, Ceremony, and Reception was important, and Casa Real could accommodate all of these needs. 3\. It is located in the heart of the Pleasanton vineyards, and is relatively easy to get to from multiple parts of the Bay Area. 4\. All of the indoor and outdoor spaces can be used in multiple different ways - this was important to us as we wanted to have an outdoor ceremony, but also wanted the flexibility to move it indoors should the weather be less than ideal. Casa Real’s variety of spaces made it possible to execute this plan B when it actually did rain the day of our wedding. What really set Casa Real apart for us was the engaging and wonderful staff: 1\. They are completely on top of the details and help guide you through the planning process from the moment you sign the contract. 2\. They are responsive, proactive, and have a positive attitude, from dealing with concerns to brainstorming solutions to problems. 3\. They are extremely attentive to their clients’ needs, creatively finding ways to meet requests and working with you to make sure the day meets your vision while still being logistically feasible. 4\. They have a wide variety of preferred vendors who can help transform the space for whatever vibe you are going for in your event. 5\. They have been doing this for a while, and have seen quite a bit, and so are prepared for almost every eventuality - case in point, our last minute changes when it was raining on our wedding day. Casa Real made our dream wedding a reality - and we cannot thank them enough for it! Here are a few photos from the event: https://manaliannephotography.com/casa-real-wedding-pleasanton/

The staff at Casa Real deserve 5 stars as well. Our wedding coordinator was Zainab and she did a phenomenal job and was so sweet. From the planning, meetings, details, e-mails back and forth and the actual wedding day she went above and beyond her duties. I was worry free on the day of my wedding and literally didn't have to stress about anything because Zainab took care of everything. Clint and I were so catered to and felt so special. It was the best night of our lives and Zainab had a huge role to play in that. The food was to die for and the servers were extremely professional and friendly.

the look and feel of Casa and of course the fact that it could hold our large wedding guest list easily was a huge plus! We did not want to just move forward with the first place we saw, so we shopped around a bit and ended up comparing every single venue to Casa Real and none of them could measure up in our eyes! We worked with Samantha Vavek during our entire wedding process, and she stayed with us from beginning to end! I could go on and on about how amazing she was and her attention to detail and experience in this industry really showed and really calmed my nerves! We got married about two weeks ago and we still have people coming up to us telling us how amazing the food was, how gorgeous of a venue we had, and how it was one of the most beautiful wedding venues they have ever been to! One of our must haves for our special day was the late night snacks Casa Real offers – we went with the cookies and milk, slider station, and French fry bar and let me tell you..I would have eaten every crumb from each of those stations if I didn’t have to squeeze into my dress :) DELICIOUS! Overall such a great experience and already have been recommending it to engaged friends as venue options!

Now for the rehearsal and on the day of the wedding, all my wedding party and family could not stop raving about Z! I remember I was so impressed by her at the Casa Real tasting that I requested her specifically for our day. Best decision I've ever made! On the wedding day, her calm tone and ability to delegate in a professional demeanor made everyone fall in love with her. She knew how to approach anyone in any given situation and accomplish whatever needed to be accomplished. Not only is the venue stunning as is and the food absolutely delicious, the pricing for what you get is out of this world. Brides - do yourself a huge favor and have your wedding at Casa Real.

The entire staff was professional and accommodating, consistently in communication with us as we went through the process of planning and getting ready for our wedding. Casa also had events that made our planning go much smoother. Their list of vendors is filled with a bunch of perfect people (Tyler Vu, Fantasy Sound, Asiel Design, and Thomas Hughes for a few shoutouts). In addition, they hosted multiple vendor meetups on site that allowed us to meet the vendors, try some things that we might want at our wedding, and also just get a feel for the place. The tasting event they hosted gave us a great feel for the menu, and as each and every item managed to come out perfectly for the 150 or so couples that were there, we knew that the venue could easily handle our large number of guests (300+!). In addition to the great food, during the wedding they managed to meet all of the dietary needs of our guests, and did it without a problem. Finally, a huge shout out to Sandy, our wedding day coordinator, who was a savior multiple times on our wedding night and made everything go smoothly. The wedding night for us went perfect, and the night flowed so well that there were many times we forgot there was anything to do until she came and snagged us for our speeches, cake cutting, etc. when it was needed.

Our day-of wedding coordinator, Zainab, was very organized and helped streamline all the choatic, logistical decisions we had to make into something much more manageable. There were some mixed messages from our family unfortunately on certain wedding details, but she was extremely patient with these conflicts (although I can imagine it must have been frustrating). I can image wedding coordinating must be an extremely stressful job, but you would never think it given how enthusiastic and friendly the Casa Real staff always are. My friends still comment on how stress-free I was on my wedding day, and it was all because Zainab handled everything that day. I also appreciate that she and the staff made sure I was well fed and hydrated during the whole event, since there's no way I would have remembered or had time to to eat otherwise. Indian weddings can notoriously run overtime (I've been to ones where the ceremony itself runs an hour or two late); we still get compliments on how ours was a rarity because everything ran perfectly on schedule, thanks to Zainab and the other staff who put everything into motion. I hope one of my friends gets married here so I can visit this beautiful venue once again!

responses via email. I was planning my wedding while living out of state and they were so great in helping me plan from so far away. I mainly communicated with Kara, Alyssia, and Casey, and they were absolutely wonderful. Casa Real provides diagrams, timelines, and lists for just about anything you might need to know for having your wedding there. I would recommend this place in a heartbeat and to use their day-of-coordinator (I had Casey). Having a coordinator during the day's events was extremely helpful! It would have been so chaotic without her. The only issue I had was that Casa Real was a little more expensive than I had hoped, but they really do offer so much in their package. So many of my guests said they loved the venue and the food. It truly is a gorgeous venue and their staff is the best! In order to go with this venue, I tried to cut costs in other areas of my wedding and it was definitely worth it as I couldn't have been more pleased with the environment of my wedding. Although Casa Real is a little expensive, I'm somewhat surprised it doesn't cost more with everything they offer. Fridays and Sundays are cheaper than Saturday, however because of certain circumstances we went with Saturday. I wasn't quite sure what to expect before visiting the location with it being in Pleasanton, however once I saw the site, nowhere else in my mind compared. Their reception room, outside ceremony site, inside ceremony room, and bridal room are all right next to each other. Their bridal room is so large and gorgeous. I didn't think we needed that big of a room, until we were using it and realized it is such a great size for everyone to get ready in. I couldn't have been more pleased with my wedding at Casa Real, I just wish that the day didn't feel like it went by too quickly. If I had to do it over again, one of the only things I would probably change is going ahead and paying for an extra hour (which I originally thought would have been completely unnecessary). I had wanted only about 150 guests and so having about 200 made it much more difficult to talk to everyone in the amount of time. However, their reception room is so large that even with 200 guests there was still plenty of room to dance!

They help you go through each aspect of the wedding, even details you wouldn't think of! The food tasting was a ton of fun too! Several months before the wedding we went to the venue for a food tasting with other couples getting married in the same months as us. We got to try 6 full sized entrees, 2 salads, 2 soups and all of the appetizers. We used a day of coordinator for our wedding day and she helped make sure the day ran smoothly, make sure I had time to breathe and relax. Everyone loved the food, drinks and venue and were very impressed with our wedding day. We couldn't have been happier that we picked Casa Real for our wedding.

I have been waiting to write this review and after 9 months of wedding planning the time has finally come!! Our wedding was on March 30, 2014 and it was absolutely flawless. I knew...

as soon as I visited Casa that it was the place for me. Be advised that they are in high demand and for damn good reason. Don't wait until 6 months before your desired date because it more than likely won't happen. Before I get to the impeccable service I'll start with the actual venue. The options are endless because it's basically a clean canvas. You can get married in 3 different locations and have the reception in one of two rooms. I chose the amber room for both and they flipped the room during cocktail hour. I don't think this is the norm here, but our wedding was 100 people and too small for the grand ballroom which can easily fit 200+. We could have rented furniture, draping and/or a partition, but let's face it weddings are already expensive. This place is pricey, but worth every single penny. Casa comes with a sweet candle package that really sets the stage for romance. I wanted a darker candlelit setting and they nailed it. The food is REALLY good, so much more than I expected and I'm pretty damn picky. The drinks are also tasty. We designed two signature drinks that were delicious and the wine was actually really good as well. They have a no shot policy and I think it's the smartest thing ever. I myself am a shot taker and had I had the option I would have been much more drunk than was necessary. I was just the right amount of intoxicated. This seems like a silly thing to include in a review, but for a drinker like myself it's helpful info. The SERVICE -wow, I can't give them enough praise. I am borderline, ok, I am a control freak and the team here put any and all worries I had to ease. I worked with Kara and Z and I never waited more than an hour for a response. That is huge for a person like myself. I expect responsiveness and thorough responses at that when it comes to wedding planning and these women blew my mind. If only all vendors performed at this level. People need to take some serious notes from this dream team. I asked questions a normal person wouldn't ask and I asked a LOT of them and they never once seemed bothered or anything but happy to help me. I could literally go on and on about both Z and Kara. Much love ladies!! Xoxo DAY OF -Even if you are the most prepared person out there, as I consider myself to be, you still can't adequately prepare for your wedding day because the emotions and anxiety leading up to it get to you. Things like the fact that you're starving around the time you take pictures. NOT to worry! They prepare the bridal suite with drinks and snacks and follow you with them as you are taking photos. Sounds minimal, but it's huge. I decided to switch to sandals pretty early in the evening and forgot about it during the garter toss. Oops. Z totally had my back and went and grabbed my shoes along with my money bag dance purse. She guided us throughout the whole rehearsal and wedding day process and I will always be thankful for that. All and all if you want a beautiful venue with a team that is going to make your wedding planning as stress free as possible go with Casa Real. I guarantee you'll be writing a novel of a review as I am now. ;)

We loved our wedding, in fact we wish we could have been guests at our own wedding! This was largely due to the team at Casa Real and the beautiful venue. You have an option of h...

aving your ceremony indoors in the Amber room or in their gorgeous garden. We had our ceremony in the garden and the reception in the grand ballroom. The ballroom is HUGE and elegant but it does require A LOT of extra decor (read: $$$) to dress it up and make it more intimate and warm. There is a beautiful and convenient bridal room, but unfortunately no groom's room for the guys to hang out. To offset this, they do provide a table and chairs in the ballroom with the same snacks as the bridal party which helped a lot since there is a lot of down time leading up to the event. They do however only allow up to 2 hours access prior to your event and you have to pay for any additional hours. The staff was excellent and very responsive and supportive throughout the entire planning process leading up to the day of.

Choosing Casa Real as our wedding venue was the first and best decision that we made when planning our July 2013 wedding. We booked in January 2012, so don't say you haven't be...

en warned about booking early. The moment we walked in, we were sold. The indoor and outdoor spaces are beautiful and grand, while still feeling intimate. Our entire planning process, Kara was always there to answer absolutely any question. She is incredibly knowledgable and very prompt responding to emails. A bride's dream! We chose to have a day-of planner, as we held our ceremony and reception on site. Jessica was just perfect. She was incredibly organized and knowledgeable, not to mention kind and fun to be with. She guided us through everything! While I liked to think that I was pretty on top of it, there were still plenty of details that did not occur to me-thankfully Jessica was already planning for those things that I missed or offering suggestions to make things flow better or look classier. On wedding day, everything was set up perfectly, better than I could have done myself. The staff was incredibly professional and every detail was taken care of. We were even sent home with a care package to enjoy in our hotel room that night. Our wedding day was not without its hiccups (like breaking my wrist two weeks prior, for one), but everything was perfect and filled with so much joy and laughter, it is difficult to put into words. My only complaint would be that we had to end at 10pm. We could have danced much later, but that's true of any special day, you don't want it to end. If you are looking for an elegant, large, professionally-run venue, Casa Real is it!
