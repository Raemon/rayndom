Imaan is not only an outstanding and creative dancer, but he also has a gift for teaching. He is experienced in various dance styles, and he’s a really good listener and can adjust...

his teaching to your own vision and goals. Imaan knows how to guide the students to elevate their dancing wherever they are in their dance journey. He’s very professional, quick to reply and gives constructive feedback so the only possibility is to go forward. He is very supportive and can adapt to different mindsets and learning styles. While I was in his coaching program, taking the dance lessons with him and seeing my progress were the highlights of my week.

My partner and I did dance coaching with Imaan for about 8 months and absolutely loved it! Imaan is an amazing dancer, instructor, and person. He balances technique, fun, and mindf...

ul awareness of the body for a great experience every class. I would absolutely recommend him as a coach if you are looking to do partner dance. We had a great time as we learned to dance (starting as absolute beginners in zouk) and learned so much about ourselves and each other through the process.

I'm a long-term student of Imaan's both through his dance school, and through personalized coaching packages. Imaan is both a top tier dancer AND instructor of multiple styles of...

partner dance. But the thing that really keeps me coming back is how much he values you as an individual. He doesn't use a cookie cutter approach with his clients. Instead he will listen to your personal story as a couple, your goals, your skills, and then really tailor your experience to fit your needs. Even better, he is willing to work with you to give you exactly what you want, even if it's an unusual ask. When I wanted a beautiful professional quality dance video (before that was one of his official offerings), I just asked and Imaan arranged a shoot and video editing with a videographer who specialized in partner dance videography. The results were truly stunning, and way better than I thought possible going in.
