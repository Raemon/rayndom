Zoe

Director of Sales

Zoe serves as Director of Sales, having joined Wedgewood Weddings in 2017 at Redwood Canyon. What she loves most about working at Wedgewood is the company culture and the endless opportunities for growth that the organization provides. Her journey into events began during college while she was studying to become an elementary school teacher and working as a server at a hotel. As a server, she fell in love with how every event was different and enjoyed learning about various cultures through her work. This passion led her to take a risk after college and pursue hospitality instead of teaching, which is when she discovered Wedgewood Weddings. What truly drives her is witnessing the reaction on couples' faces when they see their vision come to life—a feeling she describes as indescribable and something you need to experience to fully understand. Working at the Presidio has given Zoe the unique opportunity to experience many different types of events beyond just weddings, all while enjoying incredible views of the Golden Gate Bridge and the bay from every vantage point. When she's not at work, she loves spending time with her boyfriend and their two dogs, often taking day trips to the Presidio so the dogs can run on the beach while they explore the area's diverse food and activities. She also treasures time with family and friends, and enjoys hiking, traveling, working out, and has recently gotten back into reading.

o plan a wedding (eg. busy work schedules, limited free time). Its also cost effective. That said, as a result you're somewhat limited on options given the format of the business. For my husband and I - this was perfect. We didn't have the budget to hire a formal wedding planner, nor the substantial free time/timeline to research, negotiate, and visit tons of vendors. We were happy with the partner florals, dessert, day-of coordination, table setting options, and buffet dinner. Our day-of coordinator, Stacie, did an excellent job. I felt taken care of during the service, she kept us on schedule but also gave us the flexibility in case things changed on the fly. With everything else required to do to plan a wedding- eg. apparel for him/her, invitations, registry, welcome drinks, rehearsal, the list goes on and on - I couldn't imagine ALSO having to do everything that Wedgewood facilitated. Our event was beautiful, we had tons of fun, and thus we'd recommend this venue to all! :)

We had our wedding at the Officers Club in September and were disappointed with the wedding planning process with this Wedgewood location. In the end we had a beautiful wedding in ...

the Presidio, but it was not a smooth planning process. We went with the premier package. If you are looking to plan a wedding quickly and don't have time to research vendors and don't have time to make your celebration unique then working with a Wedgewood venue will work. Meetings that were scheduled months in advance were cancelled last minute. We do not live in the city so we had to drive an hour one way to get to the Presidio, make arrangements for our dog and take time off work. It was extremely inconvenient. Our point of contact at Wedgewood changed at least three times. Jessica sold us the package, we then worked with Crystal and then a month before our wedding we got a new coordinator named Sam. Sam had zero context. On the day of our wedding I felt lost. I had no direction about where to go or when things were starting. When it came time to walk down the aisle, the coordinator didn't fix my dress and my veil was twisted. I can see it in the photos and videos. I had to ask our videographer to edit out shots of me walking down the aisle because it still bothers me even months after the big day. After the ceremony when we walked out of the church, I didn't know where to go. Our coordinator wasn't there to help. We managed family photos on our own. The all inclusive package doesn't include everything. You'll need to hire your own photographer and videographer. They have a recommended photographer but I found their prices high compared to other local wedding photographers. The floral package does not include ceremony florals, you'll have to pay extra. Angela is the recommended florist and she is easy to work with over email although there were issues with her online quote system not auto updating. I was also sent another couple's quote. Our guests were happy with the food. Scheduling the caterer tasting however was a headache. Wedgewood organizes one day called the wedding extravaganza where couples with weddings in the next six months are able to taste. One day. The one day didn't work with either of our schedules and we had to schedule an alternate date. Scheduling an alternate date seemed like an inconvenience for our coordinator. They also won't invite you to a tasting until your wedding is within the six month window so if you don't like the food you're stuck scrambling to find an alternate caterer close to your wedding date. The bakery is Mazetti's and it was underwhelming. The first tasting box was unacceptable. All of the cakes were dry. We let our coordinator know and she worked with Mazetti's to order us another tasting box. Mind you we had to drive to Pacifica twice to pick up the tasting boxes. The second box was much better. The flavors are basic and the decor options are classic. The only vendors I give five stars in the Wedgewood package was our DJ and officiant. See my reviews for iMobile and DJ Mike and Rachel was our officiant from Officially Yours. If I were to do it all over again, I would have hired my own wedding planner and not relied on Wedgewood staff. I loved the Officers' Club as a venue but hated working working with Wedgewood to execute my wedding vision. I never felt like Wedgewood had us in their best interest and were there to implement rules to protect the venue and it's historic nature.

ff. Not to mention, the planning team at the Presidio, through Wedgewood Weddings, was truly best-in-class. Wedgewood prepared us so well, providing a planning binder and step-by-step instructions. They checked in with us multiple times, providing walk-throughs, and answering every question extremely promptly. We especially loved our planner and day-of coordinator, Christian, who went out of his way to make everything so seamless. Christian taught us how to do our ceremony, including little details such as hand placement, went out of his way to accommodate a creative painting engagement, and provided private time for us newlyweds. He was perfect! So grateful to this beautiful venue and our wonderful team. We will treasure our experience with Wedgewood forever.

Overall, with the help of Wedgewood our wedding went smoothly and there wasn't any complaints day of. I would remove one star due to communication errors between planners. Between ...

my second planning meeting and third meeting there was a misinformation given to me by the first planner which caused me to have to correct a lot of our menu options for everyone. They did fix and upgraded our alcohol selection due to this. I think besides that they were great and took care of everything I needed for my big day. I would hope that in the future the planning meetings are with the same planner or that everyone is giving the same information. The venue is beautiful and for the price it is a good amount of space. We had the chapel for our ceremony and the two floors of officer's club.

The venue is gorgeous - visit on a clear day and be prepared to commit to your wedding here on the spot! We were lucky and your wedding day was just as clear. The ceremony space is...

great and has a little stage (maybe eight inches off the ground) to give your guests a good view. Unfortunately, the planning process and food both leave a lot to be desired. You have four planning meetings with Wedgewood, and each is with a different person. Each person has their own understanding of WW policies and will give you a different answer to your questions (we asked about several guests with allergies). Also the notes taken aren't great; therefore, when you speak to the next person all the context is lost. Not all of the planners are easy to communicate with, or take good notes, or are adept at using email. We were not confident in the Wedgewood team and as a result we hired our own planner to both ensure Wedgewood retained all the details we told them and ensure the wedding itself went well. The food is a step or two below average wedding fare. We did get some complaints from guests. I recommend you attend their wedding expo (which includes buffet food) before you commit to the venue. Also, I'm referring to the dinner food here. The appetizers were pretty good, and WW has maybe 10 or 15 to choose from (you pick 6). The included cake is from Mazzetti's Bakery in Pacifica which is a phenomenal bakery - we got lots of compliments on this! Also, Wedgewood does include a good amount of napkins, linens (20 or 30 colors), and small centerpieces (we didn't use these). So the packages does include everything you NEED for a wedding but maybe not everything you want. The wedding itself was great. The venue was done-up well and the event ran smooth. Unfortunately, we cannot give Wedgewood all the credit here, as our hired planner handled some of the meal service and helped especially with our allergy-laden guests. Our event went well, but without our planner we do not know if it would have. I think it's a problem that we felt Wedgewood needed another planner to keep the details straight.

Actually 4.5 stars but it won’t let me put that. There were a few bumps in the road but in the end our wedding turned out absolutely amazing. The food is made there, so there’s no...

stress with outside vendors. Food was amazing especially considering I have a severe gluten allergy, bartender was great with drinks, and the service the day of was so genuine. We had an initial meeting and then they set up three meetings to plan things out and make decisions leading up to it. There was difficulty with things being kept track of which we were frustrated with since we had to repeat information, details, and decisions. We met with a different person each time which seemed to be the issue when we had to reiterate things. Once I made it clear my concerns about them not listening to Crystal, however, they heard us and made a considerable and fantastic effort or reassuring us and showing that they were listening. The day of went completely smooth without any issues, and Violet and Crystal were on top of *everything*. I’m so glad we chose this venue especially considering how much is included in their packages because that made planning this wedding so much easier than it could have been. Thank you Wedgewood for making our day so special!

We attended the Open House tour of Presidio Venues in February, just shortly after getting engaged. We instantly fell in love with the beautiful historic venues with stunning views...

and knew it would be the perfect place for our wedding. We met with Una and the Presidio Foods team who were incredibly helpful through the whole process. Presidio Foods did an excellent job of creating a delicious meal for our guests from the beautiful passed hor-devours, to the bottomless wine and beer bar to their preferred vendors' list who work closely with this historic site. It was a simple and seamless process. The food was delicious, the Presidio Foods team was incredibly professional, ensuring we as the Bride and Groom were well fed throughout the night. Even to our surprise, we were prepared a "To Go" package including to-go boxes of all our delicious food and cake and also flatware, plastic champagne flutes, and even a bottle of sparkling wine for us to enjoy after the wedding. It was such a treat! It's the little details such as this that made working with Presidio Foods and the Presidio Trust a breeze. Thank you, Una and Ginger, for all your hard work- our wedding was perfect! It was the best day of our lives!

nowing what we know now we probably would still have chosen to host our wedding there because it's hard to beat the views! With that said, our experience working with the Presidio Trust during the wedding planning process was not what we would have expected from a wedding venue. Our venue coordinator was not responsive, and we had to send multiple follow-up emails to get anything done. Prices were constantly being raised on us - we were always having to go back to old notes and emails to find the original price which luckily they generally honored, but it constantly put me on edge when I was being quoted any price because I did not know if I could trust what they were telling me. We also ran into some hidden costs they hadn't been upfront about. Lastly, they did not tell us at the time of booking they would be doing construction and the venue would be inaccessible during the time we had planned to do the walkthrough. Again, it's a lovely venue and our wedding turned out great, but expect some headaches in going through the process!

ntal process was easy. Susan was great in answering all of our questions and setting everything up! We actually rented the venue after we decided we didn't want the stress of having an outdoor ceremony and having to have back-up plans or a tented ceremony. We got lucky that someone that had a hold on the venue decided to go with another venue, so we booked it as soon as it opened. Looking at various ceremony venues in the Bay Area, the price was actually relatively inexpensive and we expected to pay much more than it was. There is plenty of parking nearby and although we did pew flowers and alter arrangements, you definitely don't have to have it as the venue is stunning on its own. I wouldn't have changed a thing going with this venue!

ensive side, ~$1,500 for just the location. For this price, we expected this place to not have flaws. However, this place does not have a built in handicap ramp and since I needed one for my wedding, they put a temporary metal ramp right in front of the chapel. I did not like this as it made the front view of the chapel looked unattractive. 2) We had electrical issue leading right up to the ceremony causing a lot of stress and no one from the Chapel was there to help us. They should had at least have a person there to supervise the chapel, at least for the set-up portion. Other than these two things, this is a beautiful chapel and we are very happy with the pictures.
