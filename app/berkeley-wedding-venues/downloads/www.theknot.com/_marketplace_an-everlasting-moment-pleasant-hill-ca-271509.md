available to answer questions, offer thoughtful advice, and guide us through every detail with calmness and kindness. She and her team were an absolute dream to work with--professional, organized, and so genuinely caring. On our wedding day, Doria and Sue handled every detail perfectly, setting up all the décor in our backyard while we got ready. Everything looked even more beautiful than we had imagined! Our parents also couldn’t stop raving about how much they loved and respected the entire team. Throughout the planning process, they offered honest feedback, helpful suggestions on layout and vendors, and ensured everything came together flawlessly. Our guests had the best time, and we owe so much of that to this incredible team. We can’t thank them enough for making our wedding day so seamless, sweet, and truly unforgettable. We wholeheartedly recommend Mirella and her team to anyone planning their special day!

nto the wedding industry and vendor types based on our needs, and so, so calm (which is what every bride and groom needs ahead of and on the big day)! I highly recommend getting the full package to get the most support you possibly can from them (well worth it). Mirella sent us weekly emails to help us stay on track of our planning progress, nudged us when needed and listened to our ideas when we were searching for vendors. I'd say she balanced both respecting our ideas and providing advice at crucial moments beautifully. As we got closer to the big day, there were numerous big and little decisions to make. It was so comforting to have a planner who knows her stuff, and we could just say "can you please help us decide?" and she'd take it on and deliver the options seamlessly. Doria was also extremely helpful and they make a great team. With both Mirella and Doria managing the event sequence and details and vendor relationships, we felt 0 stress at our wedding and just focused on enjoying our time with our loved ones! (No exaggeration). If you're considering having a planner, look no further!

Flawless Wedding Planning and Coordination – Highly Recommend An Everlasting Moment Working with An Everlasting Moment and Mirella was one of the best decisions I made during the ...

wedding planning process. Mirella was absolutely wonderful to work with—organized, responsive, and incredibly supportive from start to finish. She provided a helpful planning framework that kept everything on track, but was also flexible and always happy to adjust to my preferences and schedule. Her weekly check-ins and regular virtual meetings made communication easy and consistent, and she even attended our site visit and rehearsal in person. One of the standout aspects of working with Mirella was her vendor recommendations. Thanks to her, I found several fantastic vendors I wouldn’t have discovered on my own—each one professional, high-quality, and reasonably priced. She also went above and beyond in the little things, like printing out the vinyl lettering for my seating chart on her Cricut, which saved me time and added a beautiful touch. On the day of the wedding, Mirella served as the day-of coordinator for the first part of the event, with Lorri as her assistant, and Doria took over as the coordinator for the second part, with Sue assisting. The entire team was incredible. They managed all the behind-the-scenes logistics so seamlessly that I was able to completely relax and enjoy my day without a single worry. I'm certain there were challenges happening in the background that I never even knew about, thanks to how smoothly everything was handled. The transition between the two teams was flawless. I’m so grateful to Mirella, Lorri, Doria, and Sue for making the day run perfectly. If you’re looking for a wedding planning team that’s experienced, thoughtful, and truly has your back, I can’t recommend An Everlasting Moment enough.

9/15/2024: Perfect Wedding Planning – 100% Recommend! We are so grateful to have found Mirella. Not only was she an exceptional planner, but we’re honored to now call her a friend....

Here are a few highlights from our experience: 1\. Attention to Detail: Mirella's attention to detail is unmatched. She requested to be CCed on all emails and genuinely read through every single one. She often knew details before we even shared them with her! 2\. Kindness & Calm: Mirella was unbelievably kind and encouraging throughout the entire process. Her calm and composed demeanor was exactly what we needed while coordinating between many vendors with different styles. It’s no surprise she has such fantastic relationships with many in the Bay Area, including our venue and DJ, which was incredibly helpful and reassuring. 3\. Thought Partner: Mirella was the perfect sounding board for our ideas. With her wealth of experience, she helped us fine-tune our plans, offering invaluable insights when adjustments were needed. 4\. Post-Wedding Check-In: Even after the wedding, Mirella took the time to check in with us, discussing what went well and how she adapted to any unforeseen challenges. Her transparency added an extra layer of trust to the whole process. If you’re looking for a wedding planner, just send Mirella an email – you’ll see exactly what we mean! 8/1/2024: We absolutely cannot say enough wonderful things about Mirella Riga and An Everlasting Moment. Mirella is everything one needs and should be looking for in a planner. She is kind, compassionate, extremely responsive, organized, creative, diligent, and overall fun to work with. We completely trust Mirella’s advice; every time we come to her with a question or dilemma, she provides critical insight – based in her significant experience – that tips us toward a decision. Moreover, she has great relationships with a number of local organizations, which is reassuring and makes the process more seamless. And you can easily tell that Mirella cares a lot about you, what your vision is for the wedding, and about her work more broadly. Somehow, despite handling many weddings, she has a great memory for the exact details of your big day. Again, extremely reassuring! We have mentioned several times to each other about how grateful we are that we found Mirella – she has been that amazing. Please look no further; you’ll find a fantastic partner and ultimately a friend in her.

ly, FUN! I planned my wedding in the Bay Area remotely from Illinois - she immediately shared TOP TIER local vendor recommendations who were so easy to work with and did an amazing job. She was able to help me with venue visits, vendor communication, on-site rental set up etc. since I was a 4.5 hour flight away. Mirella was always available to share her time and knowledge with me and kept us all organized with her online portal. I would recommend Mirella and her team at An Everlasting Moment to any brides-to-be. I can't thank her enough for working with me and my family to make my night an absolute dream. Thank you Mirella!

out them to keep us on track we likely would have ended up with a wedding full of compromises. But thanks to An Everlasting Moment we had a dream wedding with amazing vendors and everything went off like clockwork. Mirella saw our vision and made it happen with extreme efficiency. She made it easy for us to stay on track, and more importantly stay excited about our wedding for the entire planning and leadup period. The pain points that cropped up were largely with the venue, and Mirella took care of everything and let us focus on what was important rather than arguing about the finer points of the vendor agreements. We'll be recommending An Everlasting Moment to absolutely anyone in the area who's even THINKING about getting married.

think we needed a wedding planner because we booked all of our major vendors before hiring An Everlasting Moment, but our venue required having a day-of coordinator. Mirella and Lorri were so much more than that and helped ensure everything went as planned. We could tell that they've done this for years based on their familiarity with our venue and their answers to all of our questions. This put us at ease because we were nervous and stressed thinking about how we would juggle all of the details that come with planning a large wedding. They kept us on track with weekly assignments, helped organize hotel room blocks, attended the wedding rehearsal and coordinated schedules for the big day with all of our vendors. On the day of, they also worked with all of our vendors to ensure everyone was on the same page, checked on us very regularly for months leading up to our wedding, and were super responsive any time we had questions or concerns. I highly recommend for those in need of a wedding planner or day-of coordinator. We were so thankful for Mirella and Lorri's services and couldn't speak more highly of them.

rganized. She was very responsive and knowledgeable on the entire process. Her networking with vendors was great as well. She would give us a list of options to start off based on budget, which immensely helped in saving our time. I knew a lot went into planning a wedding but I had no idea how much. I’m glad I convinced my husband (who really had no idea how much planning went into it) to get a planner. She is so worth every penny and I tell everyone I know to put aside part of their budget for a wedding planner. I know that without Mirella our wedding would not have gone as smoothly as it did. We highly recommend Mirella and are so glad we found her!

agical experience she provided from the beginning to the end! We knew we were extremely busy as medical professionals and we knew from the start that Mirella knew what she was doing and would be able to walk us through planning our wedding. Mirella and her team truly went above and beyond. Her availability was unmatched – it felt like she was there for us every step of the way. Whether it was a quick question or a major decision, she was always just a call, text, or email away providing valuable guidance and reassurance. Her responsiveness and willingness to adapt to our schedules truly set her apart. We never once felt like just another client; she made us feel like a priority at all times. She was there to help us no matter what circumstance. We truly cannot thank Mirella enough for her patience and flexibility planning our anticipated wedding with our busy schedules. Flexibility is one of Mirella’s greatest strengths. No matter how many changes we threw her way, she tackled each one with grace and a smile. Whether it was adjusting the timeline, accommodating unexpected guest additions, or finding creative solutions to last-minute hiccups, she handled it all seamlessly. I had a few last minute panics and unplanned events and she was there to help me navigate that. For example, our wedding portraits did not come in time and her team was able to help pick up our our portraits for us. That saved me and my husband many hours, which was extremely valuable right before our wedding! Her ability to remain calm under pressure was a lifesaver during the hectic moments leading up to the big day. Mirella is also warm and personable nature. She isn't just a wedding planner; she becomes a friend who genuinely cares about making your day special. Her attention to detail and dedication to understanding our vision was extraordinary. She took the time to get to know us as a couple and integrated our personalities into every aspect of the wedding, creating an event that felt uniquely "us." Mirella’s experience in the industry truly sets her apart. The level of organization and precision that Mirella brings to the table is nothing short of astounding. From finding the best vendors and prices to coordinating the vendors on the day of and to managing the timeline on the wedding day, she orchestrated everything flawlessly. On the day of the wedding, she and her team had everything under control. She transformed what could have been a stressful experience into an enjoyable journey filled with excitement and anticipation. Our wedding day was an absolute dream come true, thanks to her unwavering dedication and expertise. We truly could not have done it without her. If you're looking for a wedding planner who is not only exceptionally talented but also genuinely invested in making your day extraordinary, I genuinely cannot recommend anyone more fit than Mirella. We are forever grateful for the memories she helped create. Thank you, Mirella, for being there every step of the way to plan our wedding and making our wedding a day we will cherish forever!

nce we wanted to be as involved as possible in the planning, but needed help with design and décor. We were also planning our wedding in San Francisco from the Washington, DC, area, so having Mirella, Lorri, and Sue, who were "on the ground" in the Bay Area and had worked with our venue and other vendors, was so incredibly helpful. On our first call, Mirella was so sweet, professional, and easy to work with, and she was the only planner/coordinator we spoke with who asked if we wanted to incorporate any cultural elements into our wedding - we did, so that was really appreciated. From there, everything was smooth sailing. Mirella's planning portal and weekly check-ins kept us motivated and on schedule, and had us thinking about details that we didn't know we needed to think about. We got to meet Mirella and Lorri in person while we were home over the holidays, and they both had so many great recommendations on how to balance our vision for the wedding with our budget. Although we only had the Month Of package, Mirella and team were very hands-on way earlier than one month out. They also scheduled several Zoom meetings with just the two of us to touch base on our progress, and stepped in to communicate/attend meetings with our venue. Our rehearsal was super organized and efficient under Lorri's watch. Our wedding day was an absolute dream, thanks to Lorri and Sue, who were onsite. Everything, between the timeline, layout of the venue, and décor throughout, were exactly what we had envisioned. My husband and I felt like we were able to relax and really enjoy the moment, while Lorri and Sue kept us on schedule. We are so grateful for everything that Mirella, Lorri, and Sue did for us, and would hire them again in a heartbeat!

She kept us on track with all the planning so that nothing was rushed or stressful, and we didn’t miss anything either!! The rehearsal and day of she and her team were on it!

edding in Northern California. My goal was to find a Northern California wedding planner who could take care of a large chunk of my wedding planning while I was busy with my move up to the Bay Area. I was so glad I found Mirella! I knew she was the one that could provide us with all the services I needed upon our initial virtual meeting! Her services were very much within our budget. She was very understanding and listened to everything I wanted. She offered great vendors to stay within our budget. And when we opted for another vendor, she made sure to see what aspect we could take away from to remain in our budget. The weekly check-ins that she provided were helpful to keep me on track with everything that needed to be done. I was able to schedule meetings with Mirella or bombard her with questions any time I needed some additional reassurance. Each meeting with Mirella was reassuring. I am a very anxious person who just wanted the perfect wedding and Mirella helped execute exactly that. I felt so stress-free at my wedding! And I am grateful to Mirella and her team for all the hard work they did behind the scenes. We had a little floral arrangement emergency a few days before the big day along with a little change to our wedding entourage the day before our wedding and Mirella & her assistant were quick to figure it all out for me so I wouldn’t have to stress about any of it. I highly recommend going with An Everlasting Moment for your wedding planning! Mirella and her team only offer the best!

of our needs with ease and handled everything with professionalism and grace. They thought of important details we would never have remembered and they addressed anything we brought up immediately. We never could've managed our wedding and reception without their guidance and support. Any time I asked about some new detail, Mirella was always quick to reassure me that she'd already thought of it and had it taken care of. Thanks to Mirella and her team, our day went off exactly as planned. They even handled last minute snafus quietly and helped make sure things went smoothly without bothering us about little details. We cannot imagine how we would've managed without them. Now that our wedding is past, we miss our conversations and interactions with Mirella. We're going to think of excuses to keep in touch with her! :)

Our first wedding venue had to cancel our wedding due to COVID-19, and Mirella was not only able to recommend new venues, but also helped us review all of our existing vendor contracts for the date change. She is extremely detail-oriented, and what impressed us the most is that we could send her our ideas and she was able to recommend vendors that fit the specific style we were going for. She is also very communicative and responsive and answered all of our questions. You can tell that Mirella truly cares about her clients— On the day of the wedding, she and her team were working constantly behind the scenes to make sure everything was happening according to schedule-- Mirella even bustled my dress for me! We are going to miss working with her so much. My husband and I truly had an unforgettable day, and we are so grateful for An Everlasting Moment.

Mirella and her team helped us create the most beautiful, magical, perfect wedding day ever (and during a pandemic to boot!) at the Brazilian Room. We ended up working with Mirella...

much longer than anticipated after our May 2020 wedding was postponed to October 16th, 2021, and I truly think the wait was absolutely worth it. She was the ultimate professional and helped us feel calm and organized despite all of the uncertainty throughout the process due to the pandemic. Her weekly check-ins and helpful organizational tools made wedding planning feel so much less overwhelming. We took it together one step at a time and my husband and I ended up with our absolute dream wedding! Mirella did an excellent job coordinating all of our vendors, creating a timeline, and herding the cats (our large 14-person bridal party, family, etc.!) throughout the weekend and weeks leading up. We are so appreciative of her warmth, professionalism, and keeping us going throughout the process, despite being delayed a year and a half! We really could not have done it without her. I’ll always be grateful I took my married big brother’s advice when we started budgeting and planning: “Trust me- you need a wedding coordinator.”

For the wedding, the details to the design and the execution of how everything turned out was beyond expectations, and they managed to do it all without needing direction or input from us!

We received weekly emails with tasks that we were encouraged to complete to help make the planning process run smoothly (it really helped). Mirella is a professional and ready to fix any wedding issues. We had one vendor who was very disorganized and Mirella was quick to sort out the issues that arose.

And she was always right! The event itself was beautifully coordinated, and went as smoothly as possible. Mirella and Lizzy integrated all the vendors together seamlessly, and kept my wife and I looped in for all of it. Despite our timeline getting somewhat disrupted by wedding day shenanigans, they worked with the vendors behind the scenes to smooth out the timeline, and made sure we were kept informed without distracting us (or distracting from us!).

She’s knowledgeable in the industry, provided us with insights and wedding steps 1, 2, and 3, what’s a must, and what can be flexible. And definitely very resourceful; gave us variety of suggestions and options to select from for all categories: Florals, decor, F&B, hair and makeup. Our planning went very well, and on the day coordination with decor and set up were well assisted.

y a partnership process and it's not one sided. We were so pleased with Mirella and Lizzy at an Everlasting Moment! We live in Nashville and were planning a wedding in the Bay Area and Mirella was amazing to work with. We made many trips out to the Bay Area and Mirella always made time to see us when we were in town and helped us finalize our venue and she asked the right questions of the onsite venue coordinators. Things we wouldn't have thought of with regards to timeline, decor, vendor setup, etc. She really made us feel comfortable in trusting her with giving us her honest opinion and feedback on things. She also helped with making our favors, getting all kinds of shipments from us from TN and making sure that everything flowed seamlessly the day of the wedding. She helped us find a great florist and helped us to vet all vendors we considered. No details were overlooked and nothing was wasted during the day of the wedding. Photographs we brought in were moved around from the ceremony area to the reception and flowers from cocktail tables were reused in a beautiful way for where our cake was. One example where Mirella and Lizzy went above and beyond was the fact that they actually picked up our wedding cake from the bakery in San Francisco and delivered it to Los Gatos! That was really outstanding that they really helped us in every single way imaginable. Lastly, I love how Mirella kept us in check by communicating every single week with us via e-mail with our to do's/checklist. It made things easy for us as long as we were holding up our end of the bargain by getting her the info she needed in a timely manner. Overall, An Everlasting Moment is 5 stars across the board. No only was our wedding fantastic, but we have a new lifelong friends and we're so happy! Thank you Mirella and Lizzy! -Z&M

ess. Not only is she a day of coordinator for the big day, but her other packages describe her dedication to each couple. We met her in person before making a decision, and when we did, we already knew she was the one. My husband and I had a HUGE wedding. The fact that our ceremony was 45 minutes away from our reception made it difficult for us to make sure everything went smoothly. Mirella and Lizzy were there to hold it down. We had a ton of stuff to give her since we had our own centerpieces, stationery, decorations, etc. so I was worried they weren't going to be able to bring everything to the venue all within a few hours, but sure enough they did! We had a guest count of over 250 guests so you can only imagine all the stuff we had (our venue allowed us to do our own decorations so we did). Everything turned out so beautiful! The day of wedding, Mirella also made sure that I was okay, not stressed, and that our timeline was on track. Even after the 8hrs we agreed to she kept asking if I needed anything else before they left and I thought that was really thoughtful of her because she didn't want to see a bride overwhelmed. All in all, we were really happy with our decision and you will be too! An Everlasting Moment will be there to guide you for your perfect day, you won't regret it :)
