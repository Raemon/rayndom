My husband and I couldn’t have chosen a more perfect place to celebrate our wedding than Fairview Napa, CA. Our August 2025 wedding was everything we hoped for and more. From start...

to finish, the entire process was seamless and enjoyable. Valerie and Briana were incredibly supportive and patient, always quick to answer our questions and guide us every step of the way. Oscar was equally wonderful—kind, attentive, and informative. The entire team truly went above and beyond to make our vision come to life. Walking into the venue on the day of our wedding was such a breathtaking moment. Every detail we had discussed was brought to life beautifully—it was even better than we imagined. The team was so attentive, making sure we had drinks to stay hydrated and appetizers so we could actually enjoy a bite before the festivities began. Throughout the evening, everything ran flawlessly thanks to their professional coordination. We especially loved the open windows framing the gorgeous sunset—it added such a whimsical, romantic touch. The elegant draping created a warm, inviting atmosphere that tied everything together perfectly. Our wedding night was truly the best night of our lives, and we wouldn’t change a single thing. We are endlessly grateful to the entire Fairview team for creating such a beautiful, memorable experience. If we could, we’d do it all over again in a heartbeat.

venta) is fantastic and super flexible, while the bakery knocked it out of the park with our cake. We booked Fairview early on in COVID (I think we signed our contract in April 2020), and worked with them even as they had to handle changing regulations, public health, etc. They were so flexible and allowed us to postpone our wedding by 8 months, at absolutely no financial cost to us. Having seen many of my friends choose between keeping their wedding safe and healthy or loose all their deposits, I could not be more grateful to Fairview for their flexibility in allowing us to postpone to make sure our wedding was safe for all the guests. The venue was beautiful, food was great, music was bumping and we had a blast. Fairview let us use a ton of their decorations (candles, signs, etc), and just made everything so smooth. Loved them and thank you so much!!

We got so many compliments on the food, venue, and professionalism of the staff. We used all Fairview recommended vendors: Sweetie Pies for the cake, Garaventas for the flowers, Noel from Perfect Day as our DJ, Richard Wood as our photographer, and Steve from Officially Yours as our officiant. They were all so easy to work with. Our friends and family could not believe we had just met Steve the day of our wedding as our service was so personalized. I cannot recommend the Fairview Napa enough.

e for our 150 guests. It would be 5 stars, but I was so disappointed with the wedding coordinators. Lily was great, she helped us when we first started. Paige and Christina took over afterwards and they were also great, until the wedding day. I paid extra for coordination services and I received no help. My friends helped me set up and told me they asked the coordinators to do things they didn’t do. Our guests were confused when walking in. They were going to where we were taking photos because they didn’t know where to go. When I complained over the phone to the coordinators the next day, they told me they were only responsible until the bridal party introductions. That’s fine, but I didn’t receive any help before then either and my photographer did all the work! They told me I should have told the DJ to make an announcement about where people should enter. I don’t know how I was supposed to find time to do that when I was taking pictures... and I paid for their coordination services and didn’t see them at all after the ceremony. Overall, I definitely recommend this place, but don’t pay extra for coordinators. Just have a couple friends welcome people at the front and help set up. Minus coordinators, I highly recommend the venue.

Our wedding day was perfect. They set everything up exactly how we wanted it, and kept everything on schedule. The DJ was amazing too. We did some last minute changes during the reception and he did them with a smile on his face. If you want a stress free wedding, I HIGHLY suggest you book your wedding here!

We wanted a Wine Country wedding but did not want to pay the Wine Country price. After getting discouraged about the high prices of venues in the Napa area, we came across Fairview...

Napa online and decided to schedule a site visit. We fell in love! With the venue and the price. We initially started working with Bri, who a few short weeks after we booked moved on to another opportunity. However, we were introduced to Paige and Lily who were just as great. They made the wedding planning process as stress free as possible. They were on top of the timeline making sure that we were meeting with vendors and helping to sort out every last detail for wedding day. On the day of the wedding, we were in awe by the way the ladies set up the decorations we provided. They truly made it beautiful! Not to mention they were both there making sure that everything ran smoothly. Thank you Paige, Lily and Fairview Napa staff for making our wedding a true fairy tale! We wish we could re live the day over and over.

wow I dont even know were to begin! My husband and I found this location and immediately fell in love ! Lily and Paige are the best duo out there!!!!!!! Location feels like out of ...

a fairytale. Lots of greenery, beautiful views and you have access to everything - golf course, pond and vineyard to name a few. I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend booking with them. They make wedding planning easy! What I loved most is that they really give you the freedom to make the location your own and provide you with a timeline to help keep you on track. They host wonderful events to help you get to know the ppl you are working with and give out prizes if you attend ! I also booked our photographer Richard, found our Ofiicient Steve, booked with Christina at sweetie pies for our cake , used Garaventa's for our flowers and also booked with their catering and we were able to do that all in one place! Seriously I would have gone crazy if I had to find that all myself but thanks to the Fairview for providing me those options at the Elite package price ! Our wedding was so beautiful and intimate honestly better than anything in the movies ! Thank you Paige and Lily and everyone at the Fairview for helping make our dream come true!

Paige for several months leading up to the wedding and she was always so helpful and patient with me! She really was awesome and easy to work with and made sure all of my little details were just right. We worked with Lilly during the rehearsal and the day of the wedding. She coordinated everything perfectly and is probably one of the nicest people I've ever met/worked with. All of the Fairview vendors that we worked with were absolutely amazing as well. Everyone was so nice and easy to work with. The flowers, especially, turned out gorgeous and exceeded my expectations. Andrew at Garaventa's is the way to go! The cake from Sweetie Pie's was delicious, and they were able to easily accommodate our unusual flavor request (strawberry - it's my husband's favorite). The DJ was so so nice, and even made a super last minute change for us regarding the first dance, which we really appreciated. Everyone really seemed to have a lot of fun! Richard Wood, the photographer, was so great and so so easy to work with! He made sure we got tons of amazing photos and really helped me out with the wedding day schedule and helped keep me on time. I can't recommend the Fairview vendors enough. Honestly, everything goes exactly how you think it will. Paige talks you through everything so well. Also, the pricing just can't be beat in Napa. Everything is very clearly laid our for you, so you know exactly what you are getting and what you are paying for. Fairview really made my Napa wedding dreams come true (this was a destination wedding for us)! I truly wish I could go back and do it all over again. I wouldn't change one thing!

Fairview Napa was an amazing and beautiful venue for our wedding. Everything was well organized and all of the vendors that they provided through them (cake, D.J., florals, & food)...

were all so professional and a joy to work with. We only had to find our photographer and everything else was set up for us already. It make it so much less stressful for us to have to deal with. Paige and Lily were so awesome to work with and make the process easier for us and were patient and calm whenever we had questions. I would HIGHLY suggest this venue to anyone who doesn't want to have to worry about the small details and want a beautiful and affordable venue.

husband and I had a very fast engagement, because his father became terminally ill and we wanted him to be at the wedding. Unfortunately, he passed away right before our wedding, but Fairview was more than understanding and helped us every step of the way. They set up our memorial table wonderfully, and despite super rainy weather threatening our wedding (this was January 20th) everything went off without a hitch. Dare I say, my husband and I would NOT have changed a thing about our day (besides we wish it wasn't such a blur, but that's nothing to do with Fairview :) ) Our wedding was gorgeous and incredibly affordable. None of our guests could tell that this wedding was planned in a month and my coworkers were shocked at how affordable an all inclusive package was. Fairview is a lifesaver with having all inclusive packages with the vendors all lined up for you. All in all, we couldn't have made a better choice than Fairview. Great location, great staff, and amazing wedding packages.

hts: Paige recommended the best bar deal to fit our group, accommodated our numerous changes to our custom package, and my favorite "little thing" was when she fixed my necklace and dress details right before I walked down the aisle. It's the little things that count! Anthony won't forget about how much she helped with suggestions/direction for arbor decorations and how she fixed the guys' boutonnieres on where to position them on their suit. Lilly was incredibly helpful at our last details meeting, patient with our table numbers and adjustments, coordinated the rehearsal very well, and even continued to communicate after the wedding! Paige also greeted Anthony and I with champagne right after the ceremony, which was the perfect touch. DJ Noel was an incredible MC and DJ, who went above and beyond with our requests. Thank you Fairview Napa! I wrote a song and had it gifted to my husband on the morning of our most special day! Listen by going to http://smarturl.it/a-letter-to-my-love

Lilly and Paige were with us every step of the way during the planning process and during our wedding. They answered every question we had and responded to emails and phone calls instantly. They directed guests and our very large bridal party through the rehearsal the day before and throughout our wedding. They are incredibly kind and friendly. We could not have asked for better wedding planners. They made our dream wedding come to life. Better yet, it was completely stress free and allowed us to completely focus on celebrating our marriage.

ney and we wanted a one-stop-shop. This is exactly why Fairview was perfect. They are able to cater to a wide range of budgets to meet your needs. They had a built in wedding planner that already had a DJ, cater, florist and baker on list. This took soooo much stress out of the planning. They had a calendar for us and made sure that we provide them with all the information they needed to make our day prefect. We just had to get any extra decorations we wanted. They also set up all of favors, escort cards and wedding favors. We just had to drop everything off the day before. Believe me ladies, the last thing you want to do the day before your wedding is setting out favors or holding cards. I didn’t have to lift a finger. THANK YOU LILLY! !
