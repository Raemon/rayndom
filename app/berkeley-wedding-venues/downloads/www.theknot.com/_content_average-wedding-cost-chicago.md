## Average Wedding Cost In Chicago

The average cost of a wedding in Chicago proper is $54,190 for the ceremony and reception as of July 2025, according to data pulled from The Knot Budget Advisor. Based on the numbers we've gathered from other areas, Chicago is one of the [most expensive places to get married in America](https://www.theknot.com/content/these-are-the-25-most-expensive-places-to-get-married-in-america). That number clocks in at 40% above the [average wedding cost in the US](https://www.theknot.com/content/average-wedding-cost) and 30% above the average wedding cost in Illinois ($38,100), but every penny is worth it. 

FEATURED VIDEO FROM THE KNOT

"The high quality found in Chicago is hard to duplicate and there's a high price point for that level of quality," says Cavanaugh. "Venues, catering, decor, stationery, music, photography, etc.—all of these components are far above average and having a custom-tailored event will increase the pricing. Having said that, the client is paying for top notch quality and it's not 'over priced' in comparison. It's truly worth the cost for the ultimate experience."

In Chicago's surrounding suburbs, the numbers are a little different: The average cost for a wedding in the Chicago suburbs is $34,570, closer to the national average. Based on our data, the average household income of Chicago marriers sits at $173,000, while their suburban counterparts make an average of $142,000. There's only an 18% difference between their income levels, but it seems that couples opting for city nuptials splash out a good deal more, with the cost of an average Chicago-suburbs wedding coming in at 57% less. 

"I always compare the costs of celebrating in an urban environment to living/renting/buying property in that same city—what a small apartment may cost downtown would likely compare to a lovely house with a yard in the suburbs," says Stephenson. "In general, you can get more for your money in the suburbs, but those more-unique venues like museums and historic spaces may be harder to find." Cavanaugh notes that while most (not all) suburb-based vendors tend to have a lower cost than those in Chicago proper, the vendor themself determines the price, not the location. "Chicago vendors will absolutely work on suburban weddings and their prices will not change if the location happens to be in the suburbs," she says.

From barns to ballrooms, discover reception venues that feel like you.

### Average Chicago Wedding Venue Cost

According to our data, the average wedding venue cost in Chicago falls around $17,550 as of July 2025. This average comes in a whopping 44% higher than the [average US wedding venue cost](https://www.theknot.com/content/average-cost-reception-venue). Couples on the lower end of this range selected a spot for their nuptials that cost just under $6,000, while higher-end couples chose venues tickling $22,000, which would take up nearly half of the average Chicago wedding cost. 

"Many of Chicago's most iconic wedding venues don't live their first life as an event venue—they are world-class museums, historic buildings, libraries, restaurants, planetariums and theaters," says Stephenson. "These venues are such a spectacular place to host a uniquely 'Chicago' event, but they often need added infrastructure to successfully implement an event that may not be an obvious cost when booking."

The pro mentions that there are extra costs associated with adding this necessary infrastructure, ranging from steep insurance requirements for the hosts and vendors, to lines of pipe and drape to close off areas or improve sound quality, to lighting to highlight a space's architecture. Stephenson advises couples to choose a planner that's thrown an event at their prospective venue before booking, as they'll be well aware of the incrementals and factor them in accordingly.

Suburban photographers, on average, cost a little less than [Chicago wedding photographers](https://www.theknot.com/content/chicago-wedding-photographers) at $2,900. And of course, couples who opted for extras like an engagement session or looked into [boudoir photographers in Chicago](https://www.theknot.com/content/boudoir-photography-chicago) will have a higher spend level. Overall, the price falls between $1,860 and $4,540, with the average cost of a wedding photographer in Chicago toward the higher end of the range.

### Average Wedding Planner Cost In Chicago

How much does a wedding planner cost in Chicago? Like anywhere, it depends on the type you select. A full-service planner will come with a much higher price tag compared to the day of wedding coordinator cost in Chicago. Taking both types into account, Chicago wedding planners cost about $3,000 on average (30% above the typical [wedding planner cost in the US](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-much-do-wedding-planners-charge)), with an average range between $1,000 and $3,390. Couples who wed in the Chicago suburbs spent $1,750.

### Average Chicago Wedding Catering Cost

Chicago has no shortage of iconic eats, but unless you're serving up Chicago-style hot dogs (which we wouldn't be mad at, truly), it'll cost you. Chicago wedding catering costs are up there: Most couples spend around $13,820 (45% above the [average wedding catering cost in the US](https://www.theknot.com/content/average-cost-wedding-catering)) as opposed to $10,050 in the Chicago suburbs. The typical catering spend range in Chicago proper is from $6,095–$17,135. 

Stephenson's best advice for Chicago couples that want to save on food: a cocktail-style reception instead of a seated dinner. This way, the average cost per plate at your Chicago wedding will be much lower. "Even if the food itself isn't that much cheaper, the rental and staffing line items are often less," she says. "You can host an event with a shorter timeline (and therefore with less staffing), you don't need as many rentals (tables, linens, knives, forks, spoons etc.) and you don't need large centerpieces for each table or as many chairs."

### Average Chicago Wedding Music Cost

Chicago wedding DJ prices are 18% higher than the [average wedding music cost in the US](https://www.theknot.com/content/average-cost-wedding-band-dj) for a DJ, while Chicago live wedding band prices are 51% higher. The average cost of a wedding DJ in Chicago is $2,000, while the Chicago live wedding band cost is $6,800 on average. A live band in the suburbs is $3,500 on average and a DJ is $1,760 on average.

### Average Wedding Transportation Cost In Chicago

Chicago is a stunning place to wed, but it can be hard for your guests to appreciate it if they're stuck in city traffic or frantically looking for parking with minutes to spare for your ceremony. On average, Chicago couples spend $1,230 (11% above the average [wedding transportation cost in the US](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-transportation-costs-tips-trends)), while suburban newlyweds spent not much less at $1,030. Either way, there are tons of [Chicago wedding transportation pros](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-transportation-chicago) to tap, whether you need a stretch limo or party bus.

If bussing guests from the hotel to your party places and back is out of budget, Stephenson suggests providing out-of-town guests with a ride-share code or gift card. She says: "A $25-$50 gift card per group can easily be cheaper than bussing hundreds of people from point A to point B—and a lot of guests prefer being on their own timetable, anyway."

## Average Number of Wedding Guests In Chicago

The more attendees, the higher the price, no matter the [average cost per wedding guest](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-guest-cost). But Chicagoans love a packed party, according to our data, and don't seem to be deterred by the extra spend per head. We found that the average wedding guest count in 2024 for Chicago-proper weddings was 132 (compared to the national average of 116). Suburban affairs are a little smaller, with an average of 124 guests. 

For couples planning on distributing welcome bags to their guests to all their nearest and dearest, Stephenson has a note: "Chicago has a really strong Bellman's Union. If couples are planning to distribute hotel amenities or gift bags for their out of town guests, they need to budget for anywhere from $5-$8 per room for delivery of their gift bags, as most downtown hotels will not distribute those bags on a complimentary basis at check in," she says. The pro suggests that couples hand out the bags at a welcome event instead to skip those extra fees.

## What Does This Mean for Chicago Weddings In the Future?

Chicago is a major city full of culture, world-class restaurants and other attractions, so it makes sense that saying "I do" with a view of the skyline or at a revered museum will likely be a splurge for many couples. What's more, there's just a higher level of competition for spaces in desirable areas, and that won't change in the near future. But the staying power of a city like Chicago will endure when it comes to weddings, whether it's because the metropolis offers an exciting guest experience or simply because it's the setting of the soonlyweds' love story. Stephenson adds: "The most common request we get from our couples is to incorporate the views, architecture and cuisine of Chicago into their wedding weekend."

For couples in the Chicago area, Cavanaugh encourages them to save early, plan early and "be realistic about what things will cost." She advises couples set to wed next year to lock down their pros now and those saying "I do" in two years to work on securing their venue now. And while Cavanaugh does mention that she anticipates the average cost of weddings to increase in the next two years, she's got a simple solution for Chicago couples worried about costs: "The best overall advice is to be open minded and trust your vendors—they'll make your event shine at any budget."
