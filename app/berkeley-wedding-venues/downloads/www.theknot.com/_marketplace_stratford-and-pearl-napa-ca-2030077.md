by ensuring that food was coming out on time, that all other vendors are aware of the updated timelines, and staying late to ensure that clean-up is properly done. We would not have been able to pull off this day without her. I highly recommend Shannon and her team!

dea. Shannon just takes care of things so I didn’t have to worry. As an example, we had a few people cancel the day and week of after our signage was already printed and I was really stressed out, but Shannon was able to show everyone to their seats and it worked out perfectly. Also if you have a momzilla, Shannon is really good at making them feel important and taken care. I loved her team and all of their energy and even though there is so much happening during a wedding with family and friends, Shannon and her team provided a lot of comfort for me. It really felt like they were supportive of the bride and what I wanted. I cannot recommend her enough. She is the best!!!!!

DO NOT BOOK WITH SHANNON!!!! As we look back on our day, the only thing we say we would have done differently, was to have a different planner. We only had Shannon as a "day of c...

oordinator", so she did not even have much to do, and it still was a bad experience! Originally, she had said she would be in contact with me a month prior, so I (as a bride) could relax, not have to be a point of contact anymore, etc. Well she did not reach out a month before, and when I contacted her, she said "your package doesn't start until 3 weeks prior", which is incorrect. (she was horrible with communication, responding to emails/texts from the get-go). Then, she did not have my timeline or anything set up to coordinate with my other vendors! My photographer and band had to reschedule their calls because Shannon was not prepared. Week of my wedding, she was texting me asking me questions on specific preferences for wedding day, which we had already discussed. Lastly, she went home half-way into my wedding night, without letting anyone know. Just do yourself a favor and do not hire her. She made the last month/week on planning and preparing WAY more stressful that it should have been.

g I was getting. Her communication was excellent. I was not given Shannon for my day planner; I had a lady named Titiana. I thought we could work well together since we were both teachers. However, it was not that. She seemed disorganized and did not remember what the emails said when shared with her. She was 30 minutes late to help set up the wedding. She texted me during my own wedding, stating that she hated it here. My family and I did most of the things on the day. When I emailed the company, Shannon was great with communication again, but I didn't fully feel that matters were handled since Titiana never apologized for her actions. I believe your wedding will be in good hands when Shannon is doing your events.

The biggest mistake we made in the wedding planning process was hiring Shannon Goodin / Stratford Pearl as our planner. So much went wrong... Nearly all of it due to lack of coord...

ination, communication and day-of supervision of the vendors. I know Shannon recently had a new child and it's clear that's where her focus is now. She left the wedding at the start of the reception and we were handed off to an assistant we had never met, knew nothing about our plan or wedding, and despite being very nice, was entirely in the dark and unable to function effectively. Stay away.

thing with care and professionalism - and a lot of good advice! We had the day-of-coordination package, which begins about a month prior to the wedding date, so our wedding was well planned ahead of time yet the SP team helped confirm our final vision and executed beautifully. Even with their own team updates and unanticipated changes, my hubs and I always felt cared for (especially planning from out of the state).And it was so nice to be acknowledged over the holiday season for our first Xmas together. It’s all about the details! Dont hesitate when booking. :) :) :)

quired us to hire a planner/day of coordinator and upon my first conversation with Shannon, I was excited to work with her for month of coordination. Unfortunately, I felt as though she was unresponsive throughout the process. Luckily, my mom's background in events helped assuage my concerns and we were able to handle things like the room layout without her help. The real issues began in the weeks leading up my wedding-- Shannon was unresponsive and even had an away message on her email in the day leading up to my wedding. Our vendors were contacting me asking for information, and I was unable to get ahold of Shannon to see if she had sent them the necessary information. Having our coordinator be "out of office" in the days leading up to my event was incredibly aggravating, especially because we did not know this would be the case. I spent hours organizing all of my decor and writing incredibly clear instructions because I had such doubts she would show up day of. She did, but there were things done wrong that I had been clear about. My mom and maid of honor handled most of the issues, but it was frustrating to say the least. I am convinced the only reason my wedding was perfect was because of our amazing coordinator at Silverado (thank you, Amber!) Again, I feel awful doing this, but I would not want another bride to have the same experience.

I absolutely hate to be doing this, but after much time and consideration, my husband and I agreed we would not want this to happen to any other bride. And I will say we originally...

reached out to Shannon directly but we’re unhappy with her response. This might be lengthy. I highly recommend not booking this company for your wedding. I will say when first speaking with Shannon, it felt like a great fit and we actually had some connection through growing up in the same area and attending the same school. In our initial conversation Shannon repeatedly said “I will attend rehearsal” and “when I am at your wedding.” Making it clear she was the one who would be at our day. She never once told me it would be someone else who would be coming to work our wedding. If that was clear from the start we would have looked around for someone else. About a month before our wedding we got an email stating Shannon could not attend due to unforeseen circumstances and she wouldn’t be attending any of her booked weddings. However the same weekend of our wedding I saw her on Instagram at another wedding. Maybe they offered more money I am unsure. With that being said my aunt and I planned my entire wedding and we only needed a day or coordinator to assist with ceremony and decorate. That is all we needed. Someone else showed up for our wedding who was really sweet, but did not seem like a good fit. A friend in the bridal party ended up having to direct rehearsal because the day of that arrived was way too soft spoken. And the most important factor of all, on the day of our wedding only 1/3 of our decor was used!! I spent months and months planning and buying decor, we even pre staged and provided photos with exactly what we wanted to be put out. And I even stated in multiple emails we wanted candles everywhere for a romantic vibe and I wanted everything used. While it was windy in the early evening, it died down and I still wanted the candles out that is what we bought them for. Maybe she ran out of time or felt she didn’t need to use our decor? But we were heart broken to see hundreds of dollars of decor completely unused and our vision did not come to fruition. While our wedding was truly the best day, this was a huge disappointment considering we really only hired a coordinator to help us set up and decorate. It just seems that the communication with this company isn’t clear and honest; and maybe they just do not have the experience they need to ensure the bride and groom’s full vision is achieved.

onship, it was Shannon’s professionalism, polite directness, and attentiveness to detail that helped me know I made the right choice. While I knew that I was going to love planning our wedding, I also knew that I didn’t want to have to think about any of it on the day. Even though we booked Shannon for day of coordination, she was readily available when we had venue issues or when plans changed for our rehearsal dinner. The vision we had for our day with the small details was executed flawlessly by her and her counterpart, Kristi. Shannon was attentive to “difficult” family members and proactive in understanding different dynamics of our entire wedding party. I’d wholeheartedly recommend Shannon for full, partial, and day of planning because I know whatever package of hers you choose, she will execute flawlessly always being mindful of the couples desires. Thank you again, Shannon and Stratford & Pearl!!

I would not recommend hiring Shannon as your day of coordinator. I got married at Silverado Resort, which requires at least a day of coordinator, and after talking with her she sa...

id she planned many weddings at our venue so we thought it would be a good fit. However, we did not have an overall positive experience and I would not recommend her services to anyone. She did not make it the day of our wedding as she was supposedly in a car accident but luckily our venue coordinator set everything up for us and helped keep the flow of events. It could have been a disaster if we did not have our venue coordinator willing to step in and do her job for her. Shannon supposedly hires an assistant to help the day of and they did not show up the day of either. Regardless of them not making it to our wedding, it seemed she had a hard time following our venue's vendor guidelines. She double booked herself on the day of our rehearsal, so was not able to facilitate for us (even though we paid extra for this), and I had to create my own room diagrams/timeline as hers were not nearly detailed enough. She would not attend our walk throughs with us as she “already knew the property” therefore did not understand my vision for our space or the day as a whole, which is important if you are the one setting up the day of. She did not communicate well with us nor or vendors, arrived late/left early from our menu tasting (which I also had to reschedule twice due to her double booking herself). She sent me a “checklist” 2 days before my wedding that she asked me to complete which was stressful as I was preoccupied and could have been completed much sooner. Quite honestly, this all added stress to me as a bride rather than help take some away. I highly recommend all brides save themselves and look elsewhere as no one deserves added anxiety or stress when planning a wedding as it is already stressful enough.

o wedding decor and still found it too much to handle. We leaned on Shannon to source vendors for us (like the drapery, silk flowers etc.) and she absolutely pulled through. On the day of, she made sure we kept to our time (which is a HARD if not nearly impossible task when your bride and groom are running late). She also helped pull together the finishing touches like hanging a family heirloom and decorating our cake with extra flower pieces. We had NOTHING to worry about the day of. She handled it all. We appreciate you Shannon!! Thank you so much for being our day-of coordinator!!

Oh my, our wedding day was so impossibly magical – all thanks to Shannon from Stratford & Pearl. My husband and I were travelling from Australia (where we live) to Half Moon Bay, ...

where we’d been engaged the year before. We decided we wanted to have a small elopement ceremony – just the two of us. I was far from the easiest bride, often forgetting the little things. However, Shannon treats you with such compassion and the utmost care that anything we’d overlooked, she’d already taken care of. Closer to the trip, we came to realize we needed to be on a tighter budget, due to a very poor exchange rate; this meant a few last minute changes. Shannon didn’t bat an eyelid. She is the most professional person I have worked with in such capacity. We could not have dreamed our wedding would go as smoothly as it did - without one single hitch. It was an absolute dream come true for my husband and me. Thankyou Stratford & Pearl, our day is immortalised because of you.
