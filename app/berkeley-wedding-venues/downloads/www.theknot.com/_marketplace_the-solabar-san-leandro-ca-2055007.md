After coming to the realization that our daughter's dream destination wedding would not take place due to COVID travel restrictions, we began looking for a local experience that wo...

uld be equally special. We had no idea when we contracted with The SolaBar just how special they would make it for us. Every detail was considered and at every decision we found ourselves less concerned with the wedding we were "missing" and more excited about the wedding we were having. The owners and staff are so incredibly thoughtful, professional and fun. This wedding was the wedding that was meant to be for our daughter and son-in-law and much of that is attributed to The SolaBar. The vibe the impressively, tasteful remodeled Airstream brought along with the awesome service and high end beverages was second to none. Any chance I get, I'll be reserving them again. Highly recommend The SolaBar for any event you are planning - weddings, golf tournaments, birthday parties, anniversary celebrations, class reunions.

We could not have imagined our wedding day without The SolaBar! Not only were the drinks at an elite level, the aesthetic of this beautifully repurposed Airstream was amazing. Frie...

nds and family still post pictures from that day - some of our favorite bride/groom pictures were taken around the mobile bar. Above all, the warmth of the service was what made The SolaBar stand apart. The SolaBar felt less like a vendor and more like family who were supposed to be a part of your really special day.
