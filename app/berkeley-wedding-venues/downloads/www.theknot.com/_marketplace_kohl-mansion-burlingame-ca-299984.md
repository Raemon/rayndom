I fell in love with the architecture and the grounds as soon as I walked in. We had to make last-minute adjustments to our wedding venue and luckily they had our date open and were...

exactly what we needed. They were great to work with and worth every penny we spent. We were able to utilize all the rooms for the different portions of the wedding and the photos both inside and outside turned out amazing. It had plenty of parking (something not all Bay Area venues possess), accommodating staff, and an ambiance that is hard to beat. Important things to note if you are booking here: they are primarily a school, so they are only open certain hours during the day and not open to meet or host rehearsals on weekends, so you need to make sure you have some weekdays open to tour, sign paperwork, and plan the rehearsal; there is no AC, but the location being where it is, it does not get very warm indoors; they are surrounded by a residential neighborhood, so no outdoor amplified music is allowed; they require a professional wedding coordinator (which I would 100% recommend anyway); this is a historic building, so nothing can be hung on the walls that could cause damage.

Kohl Mansion was amazingly beautiful and created an amazing backdrop for our wedding. Additionally, the venue held special significance since both myself and my mother attended sch...

ool at the Mansion (back when they still had quite a few classes and study halls up in the mansion rooms). Getting to see the landscape turn into not only a place I remembered but the place I envisioned getting married at was amazing. The staff at Kohl helped throughout the process, from their vetted list of vendors to their knowledge of the grounds and kindness when asked many planning questions they were great from start to finish. When the big day came everything went smoothly and we attribute this to both the Kohl staff and the amazing vendors.

We got married at Kohl Mansion on 7/2/16 and since the very first visit, we love the space and knew we wanted our reception there. Dianne and Terri were both so great to work with...

and were super responsive via email. I was planning my wedding from New York City and they were so flexible and accommodating to my schedule when I was in town and wanted to visit the site. They were very sweet and I loved every minute working with them. They provided me with my day of coordinator who has now become a life long friend and also suggested Mills Wine Group. Without their guidance and help, it wouldn't have gone as smoothly as it did. We had 165 guests and we got to sit outside during the reception and dance inside in the Grand Hall. We received so many compliments on how beautiful the venue was and how well kept the grounds and various rooms were. Thank you for making our wedding day so beautiful and memorable!!

We looked at nearly every website for every venue in the Bay Area, but we kept coming back to Kohl Mansion. I fell in love with this place the moment I laid eyes on it. I was afr...

aid it was a bit out of our budget so we went to visit some other venues. Nothing compared, and there were so many hidden fees at other places, I felt as though we might save some money in the long run going to Kohl Mansion. Once we went on the formal site visit with Dianne, we knew this is where we were getting married. Kohl Mansion hit everything on our wish list. There was an outdoor space to hold the ceremony, and plenty of indoor space to have dinner, dancing and lounging. The library was my favorite room to hang out in, and is where myself and groomsmen waited for the wedding to start. Thing that sold this place besides the beauty and regal nature of the estate was that that we were able to bring in our own alcohol with no corkage! This is a huge savings. They also included tables and chairs (though the nice Chiavari chairs are $5 each, which we used for dinner), there is no "cake fee" and most importantly we did not need to decorate anything. They worked well with all our vendors and even let us store all the bar items there overnight so I wouldn't have to bring them on the day of the wedding. They do have an "approved list" of caterers and DJs that you have to use, but our caterer was already on the list, so it worked perfectly for us. If you're looking to do an all in one place event, this is absolutely perfect. There are plenty of places on site to take wonderful pictures, there are indoor/ outdoor possibilities and in the end, who doesn't want to party in a gigantic mansion? If you have the means, this is a no brainer. I probably could have spent $5,000 less on another venue and it would have cost me another $8,500 in fees and decorating costs. Take a tour and you'll know how awesome this place is. It was the best day of my life, and I'm glad we splurged to have it here.

makes this a bit difficult at times when trying to get an answer/response as you may have worked with one and then the other may not be up to date with the details of your event. The venue is extremely strict when it comes to your caterer as their reasons why still don't make sense to me. Despite the high fees we still chose this place for it's uniqueness and beauty. i will say, Terri was absolutely wonderful the night before and day of my wedding.

There are so many places on the grounds to take photos (the different rooms in the mansion, rose garden, terrace, lawn). Highly recommend the venue for weddings.

After looking at several different venues (hotel, golf course etc) around the bay area, it was clear to us that the Kohl Mansion was “the one”. We wanted something unique and brea...

th taking and had seen an ad for them in a magazine and were almost too scared to ask how much the rental fee was. I was free on a weekday and decided to go up and visit the mansion with my Mom. It was really important to us that our venue had curb appeal. The Kohl Mansion has just that (and a ton of parking too!). When we pulled up it was about 3pm and (little to my knowledge) there were catholic school girls leaving the mansion! I didn’t know t hat it doubled as a school as well. After seeing the mansions grandness from the curb I was worried again about the cost and almost didn’t go in. My mom convinced me to give it a try. Well, we ended up staying there for about two hours without an appointment and Terri and Dianne (the women who handle the event bookings) were fantastic. They handled all of our questions and offered some sage advice about weddings at the mansion. They supplied us with a vendor list (you are required to pick one of their many caterers and DJs provided but other than that any other vendors are up to you) and after doing the math having our wedding was not too far out of our budget when we factored in the “no corkage/cake cutting” fees and the fact that we could supply our own alcohol. One of the best parts was there were few restrictions. I felt like a lot of other venues had so many restrictions (i/e Palo Alto Hills Golf and Country Clubs no denim/no cell phone use/mandatory valet etc), but the Kohl Mansion was quite easy. There were pretty flexible time slots, although the music must stop at 11pm, and you must use a caterer/dj from their list and other than that the place was all your for the night (no double bookings etc.). As a side note, Woody Miraglia from Big Fun Dj’s was THE BEST, he was the most professional, accommodating and patient DJs I’ve worked with, he was instrumental in the success of our wedding! From start to finish we loved EVERYTHING the Kohl Mansion had to offer, our wedding was flawless and the women that the mansion provided for assistance were fantastic. We were able to drop off our items early (wine/favors/etc.) and Teri and Dianne were so accommodating. We couldn’t have asked for anything more and were so pleased with our wedding. We love the Kohl Mansion and wish we could endorse them in any way possible!

The Kohl Mansion is an extremely beautiful venue, and the wedding coordinators are very good at what they do. They can be hard to reach, but are friendly and knowledgeable. However...

, I think you can find just as gorgeous a venue for LESS than the $12,000 it costs to hold your wedding here. Unfortunately, nothing (except tables?) is included in that giant rental fee. They have an extensive preferred vendor list, with great vendors, but unless you truly have unlimited funds, this is not the place for you. Should you desire an indoor wedding, make sure your wedding guest list is NO LARGER than 130. Their website quotes a much higher capacity which can be misleading, but the reality is that INDOORS, any larger reception party will be split up into separate rooms, and your ceremony will be very, very crowded. So, in summary, the venue is beautiful, but with $12,000 securing you nothing but the building itself, the ultimate price of a wedding here (chairs, table cloths, china, a $1500 fee for using a caterer not on the list, a $100 fee for a piano that is not great, and already on the premises...) sky-rockets into absurdity. And unfortunately, it is a challenge to add personal touches to your wedding, because of very rigid protocol. In hindsight, I would have liked a venue with less "extra fees" and more flexibility. If you are a bride that knows what you want, this is not the place for you.
