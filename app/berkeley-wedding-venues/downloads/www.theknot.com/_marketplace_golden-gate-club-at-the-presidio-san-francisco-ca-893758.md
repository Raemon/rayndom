Zoe

Director of Sales

Zoe serves as Director of Sales, having joined Wedgewood Weddings in 2017 at Redwood Canyon. What she loves most about working at Wedgewood is the company culture and the endless opportunities for growth that the organization provides. Her journey into events began during college while she was studying to become an elementary school teacher and working as a server at a hotel. As a server, she fell in love with how every event was different and enjoyed learning about various cultures through her work. This passion led her to take a risk after college and pursue hospitality instead of teaching, which is when she discovered Wedgewood Weddings. What truly drives her is witnessing the reaction on couples' faces when they see their vision come to life—a feeling she describes as indescribable and something you need to experience to fully understand. Working at the Presidio has given Zoe the unique opportunity to experience many different types of events beyond just weddings, all while enjoying incredible views of the Golden Gate Bridge and the bay from every vantage point. When she's not at work, she loves spending time with her boyfriend and their two dogs, often taking day trips to the Presidio so the dogs can run on the beach while they explore the area's diverse food and activities. She also treasures time with family and friends, and enjoys hiking, traveling, working out, and has recently gotten back into reading.

We had a great experience working with the team at the Golden Gate Club! Chloe was incredibly helpful and a joy to work with - we highly recommend her. Our ceremony at the Chapel G...

arden was beautiful and went so smoothly, and the reception was so fun. Everyone raved about the food and our DJ, Roland (booked through WW via iMobile DJs). It's been 6 months and we're still getting comments on how great Roland was. Our banquet captain Gustavo was also great. Overall the whole team was friendly, professional, and easy to work with, and the GG Club is just so beautiful. We loved that we had vetted options for various vendors and that the different groups worked well together. We were worried about the wedding feeling kind of cookie-cutter, but instead it felt like us. Choosing a pricing tier and then adding or subtracting things works pretty well, but there were some areas that felt like pricing was fairly arbitrary, or overpriced. Still, we really loved our wedding and would recommend the GGC.

! Both our son and his wife have busy jobs so working with Wedgewood was great for them. Wedgewood acts as the wedding planner. Everything was organized and laid out in a helpful book along with in person meetings. Communication was great whether they were asking a question or I was from Minnesota. We were so happy with how everything went and would highly recommend!!

Stunning views from this location of the Golden Gate Bridge and presidio. Our wedding coordinator, Juliana, was extremely professional, helpful, and friendly. I requested that she...

also be our day/of coordinator and was so happy to work with the same person through the process. Our wedding day went extremely smoothly! Really enjoyed the DJ who also helped things run smoothly. I arrived to the venue the day of and everything was in order and the exact right place which was so reassuring ok day I arises felt overwhelmed. They even made sure I had champagne to get ready with bridesmaids and I received my cocktail preference handed to me for cocktail hour and dinner service. Only thing I’d mention, and which is why I didn’t give five stars, is that the food was VERY expensive and not amazing quality given the price was over $200/person. For example, the mixed vegetables included baby carrots and were very bland and boring. Of course I’d also be remiss to not mention the cost is quite high - though they are very up front about this from the beginning. For 65 people it was about $25k - which doesn’t account for other not included expenses, such as the photographer and decor. If you can afford it I’d say it’s worth the price to have almost everything included and planned for you to ensure a smooth wedding day with an amazing location! 😊

I can’t recommend The Golden Gate Club and their Wedgewood team enough!! THE BEST! The venue is located in a beautiful, quiet part of the city with several different ceremony loc...

ations offered within the venue (indoor Chapel, outdoor terrace with the trees surrounding you, or even inside one of the many rooms of the reception venue itself). It is so nice to be able to do both the ceremony and the reception in two different locations all within a few hundred feet of a walk from each other!! And with the large window in the main reception room we were able to get a beautiful view of the Bay and the Golden Gate Bridge while staying warm by the big beautiful fireplace! The Wedgewood team was amazingly helpful throughout the entire process and provided us with a guided planning book that helped us prepared for the several planning meetings/calls we had to make sure we were all on the same page with our vision for the day. Kaitlyn was amazing and patient as we worked through a few changes along the way. She was always very prompt in her responses when we had a question outside of any of our planned meetings. Kaitlyn was beyond helpful on the actual day of the wedding and kept the day running smoothly and making sure all the little details we discussed were executed perfectly. Thank you for everything, Kaitlyn! The Golden Gate Club also partners with amazing vendors and we have received so many compliments on the flowers, food, music, cake, bar, and general ambiance of the day. We were so happy with how everything worked out and how all the vendor teams worked so seamlessly together. The Golden Gate Club made our planning process and actual wedding day so easy and I would recommend this venue and team to anyone and everyone that is looking to get married in San Francisco!!

The venue is in a great location (perfect for all of our out of town guests as they could see the golden gate bridge) and my guests raved about the food (which I was very nervous about because my family has high standards when it comes to food!). You have to serve your guests the beef short rib! It's a MUST. Portion sizes are big for the plated meals and apps were passed as well as displayed on a table during cocktail hour. we provided our guests with an open bar and they have lots of options for this. The direct team we worked with at the venue was a little on the inexperienced side but very nice and worked hard to get the things we were asking for! As an extremely type A person that had very high standards I'm really happy with how everything turned out and would highly recommend having your wedding here!

We loved our experience with the Golden Gate Club. We found all of the preparation meetings to be thorough and communication was easy in the in between time to answer questions or ...

discuss ideas. We appreciated the all-inclusive feel of it, with the option to add in or remove things to really make it feel personalized to us. Rosedale flowers (the preferred florist) was easy to work with. Mazzetti's bakery is a crowd favorite (all my friends used them for their weddings as well) BUT the benefit here is that Mazzetti's will deliver the cake to Golden Gate Club (they won't do that at other venues!!). We opted to bring in a band rather than use the DJ and Golden Gate Club was very accommodating and coordinated with them to make everything run smoothly. Our guests loved the food (usually wedding food is kinda mehhh). We upgraded our lights with Otis, the preferred lighting guy and he was very flexible with the many changes we made with the light options. The bar staff did a great job with our signature drink and keeping everyone well "hydrated". We delivered quite a few extra decorations and items the day before and the staff did a great job gathering everything and returning to our family's cars at the end of the night. Everything on the day-of ran perfectly, we felt like we were constantly being checked on to make sure we had enough food or needed refills on our drinks and truly felt like the guests of honor by the Wedgewood staff. The selling point of the venue is largely the floor to ceiling windows and the view of the Golden Gate Bridge...unfortunately Karl the Fog was an uninvited guest at our wedding, which obstructed the view, but gave our guests a true SF summer experience. Inside the venue got HOT once the dance floor was packed, and I heard from a few guests that the heaters were still on-so giving the option to turn those off would have been wonderful! Overall, everyone loved their time at the Golden Gate Club and we would definitely recommend them to any other couple!

erent packages. Leading up to our wedding day, every meeting in between was productive and they listened to every single request that we had. Our day of coordinator was the one who walked us through majority of the wedding process, so it was nice that she was assigned to our wedding the day of. She helped calm our nerves and our friends and family got along with them really well. Nothing went wrong, everything fell right into place. And if something did go wrong, it wasn’t even noticeable to us. Our friends and family keep telling us that this was the best wedding they’ve ever been to, and had so much fun celebrating with us. I recommend this venue + team to help ease the stress of wedding planning.

We picked this venue for the view and for the all-inclusive package. All of our meetings with the venue were fantastic, we had a different person each time, but they all went well....

They listened to what we said, told us whether it was a possibility or not (or if it was something we had to figure out on our own) and the planning process went smoothly and easily. We decided to hire some of our own vendors just due to difference in preference and style. The problems started the day of our reception. Due to a family emergency, we weren't able to make it to the venue early enough to do a walk through. Our event was during COVID, so some guests were not able to make it day-of. We let our venue know ahead of time to remove the seats from the designated tables. To prevent additional exposure, we requested plated meals instead of buffet. 1\. My family table was not seated next to us at the sweetheart table, but rather in the corner in front of the dance floor where the music was blaring. My family was quite upset they were seated so far from the sweetheart table because they couldn't see us. 2\. All the tables were incorrectly placed. Having gone through detailed designation of which guest will be placed at which table and which guests have food allergies, this was quite a big error. We later heard from guests that they did not receive their requested food. Ex. we had some guests who could not eat meat or fish, but received the wrong item. 3\. People were still hungry because they received food they could not eat and they asked for additional portions of food (we were told at our last meeting to do this), and the guests were told there was no extra food. We paid for food for 93 guests, however had 84 guests show up. We paid for 9 extra meals we did not receive. 4\. There were not enough seats at the table. Our guests were standing during meal service because too many seats had been removed and there were not enough seats at each table for guests. 5\. The venue had asked for a point person from our side and we assigned my sister. No one listened to my sister. They would only do something when either myself (the bride) or the groom told them to. We had a very busy night cleaning up all the mistakes. 6\. The manager, seeing so many things go wrong, came up to us to tell us that no one told him about the changes so it's not his fault. 7\. Our day-of coordinator asked our preference for cake slices. We asked for one of each flavor, we did not receive cake aside from the slice we cut ourselves. 8\. The venue asked if we would like to take extra cake home and we said yes! We did not receive any cake to take home. We had a cake for 100 people and with only 84 guests... 9\. Our day-of coordinator left half way through the night. She told me the name of the coordinator taking over, but I never met him and he didn't introduce himself to me. 10\. We paid for bubble vases from our florist, but workers started taking the glass vases. I had to find the manager to explain we paid for them. 11\. Workers could not bother to turn on LED candles inside our candle holders. TLDR; Expect this venue to rip you off and not give you what you paid for. Manager was unhelpful and offered no solutions. People received food they could not eat. We paid for 93 meals and only received 84. Our cake for 100 guests somehow had no leftovers. If we weren't aware, the venue would have taken the vases that we paid for.
