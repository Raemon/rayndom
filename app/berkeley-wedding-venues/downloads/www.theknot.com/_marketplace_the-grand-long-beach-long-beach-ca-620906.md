We had our wedding in the outside room (Palm Courtyard). The venue was amazing and everything was set up just the way we wanted it. Marissa and Lauren were super helpful and on top...

of everything as we had an out of state wedding. All of our guests loved the food which was cooked perfectly. The Grand was able to customize the room layout, the food and drink package, and even accommodate vegetarian as well as vegan guests with no problems. Any issues we ran in to they were more than willing to help us resolve. Planning a wedding from two thousand miles away is tough, but the Grand made it so much easier for us.

We had our wedding in the Monarch room this past August. Everything turned out wonderful. My fiancé and I were pretty busy during the planning process, so once we saw the Grand had...

packages that include catering, linens, chairs, etc for a per-person price, we knew it would fit our needs better than other venues that separated the food from the tables/chairs/linens/silverware/etc. (We really just had to take care of flowers, DJ, & lighting.) Our coordinator, Kimberly, was so helpful at answering all of my questions. As for the wedding itself - everyone, ourselves includes, was 100% satisfied. The food was amazing, the servers were wonderful, no complaints at all!

. I love the fact that you can use the Bridal suite to get dressed and have it until midnight. Andry was our event coordinator and she's wonderful! She worked with us on extra things we requested and made sure everything was taken care of. This is a great venue!

I'm having a destination wedding in Hawaii in March 2015, and a reception for local family and friends at this venue. I wanted to write a review based on the experience I've had so...

far. Andry is my wedding coordinator. She is super sweet, attentive and accommodating. When I met her she was very willing to working with my budget, and didn't try to up sell me on anything that was out of my price range. However, she did recommend small upgrades within my budget, and I'm confident these small things will make a huge difference in ambiance. Andry always replies to my emails the same day, and she is always very professional. Working with her takes all of the stress away from planning my reception (well, she is basically planning it for me). I feel like I'm in good hands. The pricing is very reasonable AND the venue is great! I chose to have my reception on a Sunday evening (because it's an amazing deal), but even the Saturday event prices were super affordable! I searched and searched forever to find a venue that was in my budget that still looked nice and this place was perfect. I would say, if you're a bride like me who doesn't necessarily want to spend your entire life savings on your wedding but would still like to throw a lovely event for your guests, choose The Grand. I'll update my review once the event is over, but I feel very confident that my reception is going to be perfect! :)

I can honestly say that I did not feel stressed out about my wedding last month, and that everything worked out without a hitch! The Grand deserves a lot of credit for our beau...

tiful, stress-free wedding. Since I was very busy with my work this past year, my fiance and I wanted a venue that would take care of most of the planning for us. The Grand is a beautiful venue, and they do a lot of weddings, so they are experts at the process. Their wedding packages include most of what you need- tables, chairs, linens, food, beverages, cake, etc. We only had to worry about details like the rabbi, photographer, DJ, and flowers. (They have a list of vendors for these items, but we didn't use them, so I can't comment on their quality.) We opted to have our ceremony on the Palm Terrace and our reception inside, so it was very convenient for all of the guests. Our event coordinator, Ann, was amazing! She was friendly and helpful throughout the whole process. While she let us know about all of our options for our reception, she never pushed the "up-sale" or tried to talk us into paying for something that was out of our budget. It was all about what we wanted and what we could afford. Anytime I called or emailed her, she got back to me right away. (And on the rare occasion that she took more than 24 hours, there was always an automated reply letting me know when she would be back in the office, and then she responded as soon as she returned.) Though my fiance and I were not blown away by the food at their quarterly tasting, the meals were excellent on the day of our event. I especially recommend the salmon- several of our guests commented that it was cooked perfectly. Also, the Grand's prices were the most reasonable of any of the full-service venues that my fiance and I looked at. Someone could probably do better with a DYI wedding, but I think that it would be a lot more trouble for only a little cost savings, in the end. We got a special package since we had a Sunday night wedding, which is a great deal if you're willing to have a Sun-Thurs event. In addition, the Grand doesn't throw in hidden fees like a lot of venues do- service charge and tips are included in the invoice (though we gave a little extra for our servers), and the parking garage is free and convenient. There were no "hidden" charges, and they were very upfront about everything. I highly recommend the Grand, especially if Ann is coordinator!

ok great care of us. We did a lot of little upgrades which made everything that much nicer. The Chivari chairs are a must in my opinion and the open bar really brings the party together. We used the Garden Room and had a full bar available to our guests that was great in photos as well. Absolutely worth the money we spent. We had an amazing time and so did our guests. We did the ceremony on the outside terrace. The sun was just going down as the ceremony began and for the first 10 minutes the sun was in the boys eyes, but as soon as it set the rest of the way it was really beautiful.

easoned perfectly and my guests enjoyed it. I would have gave the Grand 4.5 stars, but with this system, it's not applicable. The reason they received 4 and not 5 stars is because of the pricing. I wish they would allow you to fully customize your own menu. Other than that, it was very nice.

iant that I might have is that they had their timing alittle off. For example we were supposed to open the bar after the ceremony but they started before. Also the cake was supposed to be served at 9:30 but no one reminded me the time so that we could do that on time.
