Sizes range from 0 to 30, but you can also provide your specific measurements to get custom sizing for _free_ —that means no trips to the tailor or extra tall heels required. I've personally ordered a few styles using the custom sizing feature, and each one has fit like a glove.

A simple silhouette in a chic champagne shade? Can't go wrong. We love this cheap bridesmaid gown's understated elegance with its cowl neckline and ankle-grazing length, and it's hard to beat that $55 price tag. Plus, it has adjustable straps for a just-right fit.

_Photo: Meshki_

We love this chic take on a traditional slip dress from Meshki. It has a low open back and slanted, off-the-shoulder cowl neckline that perfectly coordinates with the asymmetrical hem. The "butter" shade is an on-trend pick, but you can choose from eight others, including navy, emerald and cornflower blue.

Short flutter sleeves and a high neckline combine for a budget bridesmaid dress that's modest yet anything but boring. This ice blue number does ring up slightly over the $150 mark, but Six Stories frequently has great sales that'll let you snag it at a lower price.

## How to Save Money on Bridesmaid Dresses

As a fashion editor, I have a lot of sale shopping tricks up my sleeve. I've also been a bridesmaid seven times, so I've become pretty great at saving big on bridesmaid dresses, specifically. Ahead, I'm walking you through my best advice for scoring cheap maid-of-honor dresses and bridesmaid gowns.

### Look Out for Discounts and Sales

While not every retailer will have the same sale schedule, there are certain times of the year you can almost always expect stores to drop prices. A few major holidays to keep in mind for [wedding discounts](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-discounts) are President's Day, Memorial Day, the Fourth of July, Labor Day, and Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Remember that many retailers also regularly update their sale sections, so checking back regularly is a great way to catch a stunning low-price bridesmaid dress before it's gone.

### Rent Your Bridesmaid Dress

A major pain point when it comes to bridesmaid dresses is that they're rarely worn again. With that in mind, it doesn't always make sense to invest in a pricey gown. However, [dress rental sites](https://www.theknot.com/content/best-clothing-rental-sites-for-every-wedding-event) like [Nuuly](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=9ibcrDa*U1o&mid=44644&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nuuly.com%2Frent%2Fthe-wedding-shop&u1=tk-bridesmaid-dresses-under-100) and [Rent the Runway](https://www.pjtra.com/t/8-12557-88550-223734?sid=TK-bridesmaid-dresses-under-100&website=177979&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.renttherunway.com%2Fpdp%2Fshop%2Fbridesmaid%2Fproducts%3Ffilters%255Bzip_code%255D%3D78745%26filters%255BcanonicalSizes%255D%255B%255D%3D8%26filters%255BcanonicalSizes%255D%255B%255D%3D6%26filters%255BprimarySize%255D%3D8%26sort%3Drecommended%231753128177750) have tons of bridesmaid-worthy options to offer, which means you can still get your hands on a designer look without spending a dime over $100.

### Shop Secondhand

Whether you've been waiting for an excuse to splurge on a certain gown or simply want to save on the dress your bestie has requested you don on her wedding day, it's always a good idea to browse [used bridesmaid dresses](https://www.theknot.com/content/places-to-sell-bridesmaid-dresses). Sites like [Poshmark](https://poshmark.com/) and [The RealReal](https://www.therealreal.com/) are all great options, and most times, you'll find plenty of styles that haven't even been worn yet.
