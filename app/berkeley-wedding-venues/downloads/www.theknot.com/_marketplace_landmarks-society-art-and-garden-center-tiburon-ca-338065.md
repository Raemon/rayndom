### About this venue

The Landmarks Art & Garden Center is a wedding venue that is nestled in Tiburon, CA. Near mountains and the bay, the venue offers a historic setting surrounded by nature. Walking through history while also enjoying the gentle sound of birds, loved ones can celebrate against a timeless backdrop. Picturesque, this venue is steeped in lush views and stories while striking the imagination of romantic, bygone days. Restored with care, The Landmarks Art & Garden Center features both a cottage and garden on the grounds. The building has its origins all the way to the start of the city, making it an important part of Tiburon’s heritage. The house was built in the 1870s. The gardens had become wild over the years, but in 2000, a landscaper and passionate group of volunteers transformed the property. Now a variety of trees, along with shrubbery and flowers, dot the estate and offer a sense of sophistication and peace. The location as a whole brings you back in time and carries a charming and whimsical air ideal for nuptial events. Guests that attend your wedding at The Landmarks Art & Garden Center can look out onto Richardson Bay while breathing in the fresh air. The property has a four-terraced garden. In addition, your nearest and dearest can take strolls through the rose arbor or walk down the idyllic brick paths. Both ceremonies and receptions can be held in any of the various outdoor areas, each with views of the landscape and water. Guest lists of 150 can be accommodated for outside weddings while up to 55 people can celebrate in splendor inside. Besides fetes of gathered loved ones, the location is also suited to elopements. The estate can likewise be booked year-round. Besides your wedding, you may also host engagement parties, showers, and rehearsal dinners here. Be sure to check out the gallery for an exclusive 360° Virtual Tour, and experience the breathtaking beauty of Landmarks Society Art & Garden Center today!

If you are considering having your wedding here I suggest you reconsider. While the location is beautiful, the staff and policies make this a very challenging and unwelcoming venue...

. Before we signed our contract the salesperson did a great job selling the place. She boasted about all of the great attributes and told us how wonderful it would be to have our wedding there. But once the contract was signed and the deposit paid, the person couldn't even remember our names or who we were when we made appointments to return to see the space. She had to be reminded each time we met that we had already secured a date and paid a deposit. The whole thing felt very impersonal and unprofessional to me. [NOTE: this person was new and replaced the woman Barbara that many people mention in past reviews.] As the date of our wedding approached things got progressively worse. Rather than make us feel excited and at ease about our upcoming wedding we were being barraged with new warnings and restrictions which caused stress and anxiety for our family. We were told that we we would need to bring in more bathrooms to accommodate our guests (even though our guest count of 100 people had never changed), we couldn't play amplified music after 8:30pm (a change in policy), we needed professional valet or shuttle services rather than use UBER or do our own shuttling (something we were never told), and that our DJ had to be "licensed and professional" (whatever that means). The way in which the barrage occurred (both in attitude and timing) was very off-putting and unprofessional in my opinion. The day of event was no better. The on-site docent was brusque and unwelcoming from the very start. A number of our guests also mentioned how unfriendly she was to them that day. The first thing she sprung on us when we arrived was that we couldn't have amplified speeches. Were our maid of honor and best man supposed to shout above the passing traffic in order to be heard?! This person even took the liberty to move our speakers/PA at one point without asking permission. She was rude to some of our guests, especially the children, and by 8pm she was already starting to pressure us to wrap things up. We had just cut the cake and served desert (and also paid to be there until 10pm!) Overall, she was awful to deal with and should consider finding another profession. This venue may seem attractive because of the location, but honestly it's not worth the $4500 (or more) unless you're having a small day-time gathering with a much older crowd. It's amazing to me how they began to shift the burden for additional expenses to us in order to make their venue seem more attractive (i.e. bring in more toilets, get professional shuttle drivers, etc.) Other cons are that they are located on a busy road, there is no refrigeration, there is major car noise from the street below, there is very little parking, neighbors complain about noise, the grounds weren't properly landscaped before our event, you cannot access the location without an appointment, limited electricity, and they charge extra for set-up and breakdown time. They market themselves as a venue for up to 150 people, but unless you intend on serving food that needs very little prep time and have an extra five thousand dollars to put into rentals don't believe it. With so many beautiful wedding venues in the Bay Area it's just not worth the hassle to deal with the many obstacles presented at this one. Good luck.

Response from Landmarks Society Art & Garden Center on 02/27/2018

Dear Chris and Michaela, I am surprised to learn six months after your wedding and celebr...

ation that your experience with Landmarks was less than perfect. It is our goal to make sure that every client’s event is effortless and enjoyable. We have guidelines outlined in our rental agreement that are in place to make sure every celebration runs smoothly and becomes a positive memory for couples, their friends and families. Items included are shuttle and parking arrangements, and noise restrictions as we are in a lovely residential neighborhood. We do recommend, but do not require, supplemental bathrooms for guest counts of 100 for your guests' comfort. This is all information that we provide upfront. We know wedding planning can be stressful and we operate with the intent of presenting the required logistics to ensure the most successful and rewarding outcome. We are proud that the Art & Garden Center has contributed to a memorable wedding day for hundreds of couples over the last 15 plus years, and truly regret that you had a different experience. My best, Patty Flax Landmarks Liaison

We had our wedding ceremony & reception of 125 people here this past August. Barbara was a pleasure to work with (she manages the property). The venue was exactly what I was lookin...

g for: a beautiful, garden outdoor setting with a view. The property is tiered so you have gorgeous views of the bay from the several brick terraces. While only encompassing an acre of land, there are paths that weave people through trees and garden foliage so guests could get a little privacy while not getting lost. There's a garden greenhouse in the bottom corner of the property that the caterers used to finish off and plate meals without being an eye sore to our celebration. We did have to bring most things in (tables, chairs, ovens, etc.); however, they have events here often enough that it was all quite smooth. We used a caterer and valet off their preferred vendor list, which made things more seamless since these teams had worked the venue many times before. Our event went from 2-9pm which negated the need for expensive lighting costs. Music has to be turned off at 9pm due to local noise ordinances, so this is definitely not a venue for you if you're looking for a late night party event. We hired a DJ and received no noise complaints. We had our ceremony on the main brick patio terrace under a gorgeous old oak tree. Reception was held on the lawn and dessert and dancing continued on the same ceremony brick terrace. The Tiburon Landmarks Society is a local non-profit, which felt good knowing my venue fee went towards a good cause. Also nice is that the cost is tax-deductible! The odd thing about this venue is that it doesn't book up like other outdoor venues in the area. I truly have no idea why, as this venue was my top pick from the beginning. The only negative to the venue is that it is very exposed to sun. We wish we had rented more umbrellas or more creative sun protection for our guests' comfort. Nevertheless, everyone had an amazing time and the day was absolutely perfect!
