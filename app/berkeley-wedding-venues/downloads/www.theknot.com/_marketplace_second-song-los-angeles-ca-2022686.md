Our wedding DJ was Geronimo, and we truly couldn’t have asked for a better fit. He was fantastic to work with — making himself available for follow-up calls once our details were locked in and being extremely collaborative with our ideas and overall vision. His musical taste was exactly what we wanted, and he did an amazing job keeping the energy up while also keeping the schedule moving smoothly throughout the night. Everything flowed seamlessly, the dance floor stayed lively, and we had such a great time working with him. We couldn’t recommend Geronimo and Second Song more highly!

issues, the sound was clear, and I was impressed by the acoustics all evening. I liked DJ Tay’s mixing a lot, and she played high energy songs out of what we chose. Hopefully I didn’t bore her with my music taste. The ceremony music was timed very well and the volume was good. The lights and light techs dazzled us with up lights and Gobo lighting on the ceiling, saving thousands of dollars on white curtains. Have to say, DJ Tay and the Second Song team made it a very memorable experience!

We go to a lot of weddings and think this was the best wedding DJ we've experienced (not that we're biased or anything haha). Our guests had the best time and it was soooo much fun! People were dancing the whole night which was very important to us. The photobooth was also such a hit! None of the weddings we've been to had a photobooth like this so it felt very elevated and chic and people were loving it. The attendant was also so nice and friendly, which we noticed that night, but multiple guests mentioned to us as well.

We hired Rob from Second Song. From the very first call with my husband and I, he took the time to really hear our needs and what we envisioned. Throughout the planning proces...

s, Second Song was extremely organized with a portal and made it an exceptional experience for me and my husband to easily input our information for every detail from pre-ceremony music vision and vibes, to walking down the aisle with specific songs, to making the grand entrances exceptionally special, fun, and memorable, all of the announcements, to every detail with speeches and first dances. It really set such an ease knowing every detail was accounted for. Our DJ, Rob, delivered on every single detail we asked for and more. We all had such a fun time dancing, and Second Song truly made it a 10/10 experience in terms of the music/sound experience. If you are looking for an amazing DJ/MC service for your wedding or event, we cannot recommend Rob and Second Song enough. Thank you, Rob and Second Song, for being such an important part of our special day and for doing such a great job. We sincerely appreciate it!

I agree with the hundreds of 5-star reviews of Second Song, but I wanted to specifically give a shout out to DJ Tyler O! While Second Song made the process leading up to the weddin...

g easy and seamless (and the cold sparklers were a hit), DJ Tyler did an amazing job at my wedding and absolutely CRUSHED the dance floor. My husband and I have differing music tastes, but DJ Tyler was able to find common ground and played banger after banger that kept all of our guests on the dance floor till the very end. As someone who goes to music festivals often, I was impressed by his mixing skills and appreciated that there was never an abrupt transition between songs. He also did an amazing job MC’ing and executed all of our requests for playing specific songs at certain times and starting songs in the middle. I don’t think you can go wrong with any DJ’s with Second Song, but I do highly recommend picking DJ Tyler O!

Second Song is amazing. I emailed Rob at 10:30 on a Monday night and had a response within 15 minutes. Rob sent over a list of DJ's for my daughter and future son in law to review ...

and they picked Luis. He was incredible. The bride and groom had a definite vision and Luis nailed it. The dance floor was packed all night. The last couple of songs Luis joined in and the crowd loved it. I would definitely recommend Second Song to anyone looking to book a DJ.

d about getting the vibe just right for every part of our day. Fredy took the time to collaborate with us on the music for each event and nailed the energy—from the ceremony and cocktail hour to the dance floor. No one wanted the party to end, and Fredy even stayed a little late to keep things going. The dance floor was packed all night, and our guests are still talking about how much fun they had. We can’t recommend Fredy and Second Song enough—he made our celebration unforgettable!

We worked with Enrique from Second Song. We did the Party Only package where he played for just 4 hours. We communicated a bit before the wedding and he was super receptive to and ...

understood our vision. We met in person during the reception after he introduced us and our families and we started our first game. We filled out the music form Second Song provided us in detail as we had originally thought of DJing on our own with just a playlist so we already had a pretty extensive list of “must have” songs to play for Enrique to choose from. We also had our friends requests songs in advance as well and added them to that same playlist. There were a few snafus but we don’t know whether that was on Enrique, our venue’s A/V team, or our wedding coordinator and her team: a) There was no grand entrance music played as he introduced us. Not sure why given it was on the form but we went straight into the game anyways (which that music was played) so it’s whatever. There seemed to be quite a few audio issues around that time, so won’t necessary blame Enrique for this. b) During the reception, we were going to have our speeches spaced out with our parents speaking once salad course was served, giving the guests a bit of a break, then our friends speaking during the entree course, another break, then we speak right at the end to open the dance floor. Again, not sure if our coordinator team just didn’t communicate this or because the food was running a bit behind that then it threw off the schedule but Enrique introduced all of our speeches (including our thank you) back to back. We held off on our speech until the end of dinner but in retrospect, having everyone’s speeches back to back was nice (and seemed to give the kitchen more time to figure out whatever issue they had). c) I will say in general, there was much less mixing than we heard on Enrique's sample mix on the Second Song website. That was a nice thing btw was that you could listen to all of the DJs beforehand. As I mention below, it was still fun and the dance floor was packed all night, but we had just hoped for a bit more mixing of songs. In terms of the dance floor, it was packed all night, which was great. Not sure if it was because where the speakers were placed made it too loud to sit at the tables thus almost forcing guests to go to the dance floor, or us placing the bar next to the dance floor so that you had to go past it to get a drink, or our photographer doing a group photo to open the dance floor and then another mid-way to keep the energy going, or even us buying glow sticks that got even non-dancers involved, but it was way better than expected. Our friends had a fantastic time. I was sweating, we were laughing. With our “must have” playlist being 4 hours and our dancing barely lasting 2, we weren’t going to hear every single song we wanted but what we got was fun enough and kept the crowd going. Working with Second Song was easy as they were extremely communicative throughout the process so I would highly recommend the company for your wedding. Despite the snafus above, I'm still giving a 5 because as mentioned, not sure who is really at fault for them and we liked Enrique regardless.
