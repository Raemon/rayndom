expectations in every way. Lindsey is organized, detail oriented, and always ready to problem solve when something doesn’t go expected, which takes a ton of the stress out of wedding planning because you know that Lindsey has your back. More importantly, Lindsey is a kind and thoughtful person who is a pleasure to work with. Every vendor that we hired confirmed this when they said “oh, you’re working with Lindsey? She’s the best!” It was really incredible. We can’t recommend her enough.

ring the whole eight months we worked together. I was finishing law school during the lead-up to the wedding (not recommended!) and was sometimes terrible at keeping up with correspondence and next steps, but Lindsey was always there to keep us on track with gentle reminders and super helpful resources. Lindsey also has amazing relationships with the very best vendors in the area, which makes all the planning not only easier but also more fun! Trust me, you don't want to worry about a thing more than you have to on your wedding day, and hiring Lindsey and Lovely Day Events is the surefire way to have the most beautiful and carefree day possible.

husband and I knew absolutely nothing about weddings, and we were able to rely on Lindsey's expertise and connections to make sure that all our needs were covered. From the very start she connected us with vendors who are truly the best in their fields, as well as our venue, which turned out to be exactly what we were looking for. She thought of everything, including services we didn't think we needed but turned out to be a huge asset on our wedding day. Lindsey is also very responsive and communicative and was a great liaison between us and our vendors. She was great at keeping us organized and on track with monthly check ins and shared documents that we could access at anytime. At the end, so many of our guests said it was the best wedding they had ever been to, and we are so grateful to Lindsey and her team for this amazing event!

endors cannot be understated. From super helpful tools+resources to make the planning process as easy as possible, to coordinating and helping manage vendor calls, to day-of support - Lindsey made out wedding unforgettable, not only for my wife and me but for all of our guests. Lindsey also displays a high level of emotional intelligence and empathy. She has a knack for knowing exactly when to make a recommendation, or take a step back and let the couple decide (and always with as much information as possible to make an informed decision). Literally EVERY vendor was 5-star and somehow Lindsey worked her magic to change the weather from a rainy forecast to stalling the rain until the festivities ended. Lindsey was accountable, kept things moving forward, and was ardent/steadfast in our wedding planning. Day of, she was a source of calm that made the day run fluidly and without a hitch [except us getting hitched ;) ] We owe our unforgettable day to Lindsey and if we have to do it again, or refer a friend, Lindsey would be top of the list without an ounce of hesitation. For a wedding 1.5 years in the making, we extend our sincere gratitude and appreciation for all of her help, suggestions, and ability to create the wedding we could only have dreamed of, become a fairytale reality. Our appreciation will be lifelong and truly cannot thank you enough. <3

Lindsey and her team were exceptional. During the planning process, Lindsey made sure that nothing was missed and brought things to our attention that we would not have thought of ...

otherwise. At first we were hesitant, but in the end her recommendations were always the best decision. In addition, we are certain that there were so many "behind the scenes" things that she did for us that helped make the process so smooth, it is hard to know just everything that goes into planning and executing such a large event. Everything was so well executed on the day of the wedding, that we could just sit back, relax, and enjoy the day with our friends and family. I am sure there were some issues that came up, however Lindsey handled them all seamlessly and never brought any problems to us. Her communication style is perfect and kept us on track the entire day - so well that we had even some downtime before the ceremony! We are so grateful to Lindsey for always keeping a level head, maintaining the highest level of professionalism, and being an overall wonderful and friendly person to work with over the many months leading up to the event. Thank you so much for everything!

o when we picked our wine country venue that required a planner, we had a little anxiety about finding someone who was going to help us execute our vision from afar, while caring as much about the things that were important to us (which included staying on budget). Lindsey came highly recommended by friends of ours and after our first chat with her we knew she was the right fit! Lindsey's knowledge and relationships with other wine country vendors are invaluable, she made recommendations that fit our needs and priorities and honestly the result was a perfect day where we could just focus on each other, our family and our guests, truly the best day ever. We both agree that we might have to have a vow renewal just to have the opportunity to work with her again

The wedding was way beyond our expectations (which were high already)! It was such a wonderful, joy-filled, stress-free, pleasant day. Our families and guests have raved about the ...

event and we’ve gotten so many comments about how nice the vendors were. I don’t think I’ve ever talked to a vendor at someone else’s wedding, so that’s really cool to hear. Lindsey offered exactly the guidance we needed, from helping us select reputable and highly skilled vendors who are also wonderful people like her (trust her recommendations, you won’t regret it!) to little things like helping me figure out what kind of sunscreen wouldn’t ruin my dress or which restaurants in Napa had private space large enough for our rehearsal dinner! I didn’t have to worry about a thing on the day of the wedding or even the days leading up to it. Lindsey had everything covered, and she helped me get my ducks in a row before the big day so our families and bridal party knew what to expect as well. I was dreading wedding planning after how much time and effort it took to research venues. Hiring Lindsey was easily the best decision we made because all that stress disappeared the moment we did. She made it not only manageable, but fun.

country pre-pandemic for June 2021. Any reader can imagine the turbulence and associated stress that came with the ups and downs of trying to figure out how to plan a wedding during this time. Lindsey kept us up to date regarding state and county ordinances, what we might be able to expect, and served as a strategic advisor for us as we had to make many decisions based on limited information. This role was very important, and the trust she garners with local vendors served to put us at ease knowing we would not have to course-correct many details through times of rapid change -- Lindsey handled it! She is organized, kind, a great listener, and again -- an outstanding strategic advisor. I was not quite sure what to expect out of a wedding planner, but these seem to be many of the ideal traits and we could not have been happier with the outcome. Thank you, Lindsey!

I sincerely cannot recommend Lovely Day Events enough! Lindsey seamlessly took over planning our wedding with less than one month before our big day (as you can imagine, a couple's...

worst nightmare unexpectedly having to secure a new wedding coordinator in less than 30 days), and most importantly she helped us feel confident that our event was under control and in the most supportive hands. We appreciate how Lindsey is so well-connected and respected in the industry, and clearly has many years of experience executing events. Lindsey brought an incredibly personal touch whenever we corresponded with her which made the entire experience feel much less business-transactional, like she truly cares about her clients. Lindsey is extremely knowledgeable, organized, efficient, and personable--our ideal attributes for someone so heavily involved in executing our big day. Nearly three months later, my husband and I are still floating from the most magical weekend, and our family/friends can't stop raving about how perfect our wedding was. We feel so much gratitude for Lindsey and Ted for taking us on with such short notice. We never could have pulled off our special day without Lovely Day Events, and we will be eternally grateful for their services!

collected the whole time. She was always on top of the latest COVID updates and was able to keep us abreast of developments as they occurred. She was seamlessly connected to all of our vendors, which was a huge source of relief as we navigated the uncertainties of wedding planning in 2020. Most notably, she ran the tightest ship imaginable during the wedding weekend! Lindsey continually checked in with both of us and our parents, made sure all our needs were met, and executed every detail with precision. If there were any issues during the weekend, we never got wind of them. Many of our guests have reached out to us in the days after the festivities to tell us it was the best wedding they’ve ever been to, and that is due in no small part to Lindsey. She is truly one of a kind, and we can’t recommend her highly enough to anyone in search of a planner in the area!

Lindsey made everything feel personal, from the check in emails, and reminders to take time off and relax, to the easy-to-do check lists and charts that helped me stay sane, I couldn't have asked for a more supportive partner and guide throughout this crazy process. She was flexible and always made sure to find time to hop on the phone, reply to a text, or follow up on an email when I was feeling the weight of decisions or slightly overwhelmed. Most importantly, Lindsey also told me when to just stop over-thinking things. She got to know me and my personality and eventually got to a place where she was able to either make choices for me, or tell me to stop thinking about the thing and either do it or not. I really needed that trust in her and I had it. I would recommend Lindsey to anyone looking for a beautiful, romantic, organized, and calm wedding planning process. She will not let you down. Thank you SO much, Lindsey!!

Lindsey is the best. I was planning a rehearsal supper/welcome reception for 120 guests from 3,000 miles away. There was no way I could do this without the professional guidance ...

and help Lindsey gave me! Our venue was a beautiful vineyard but needed everything brought in from food, flowers, ice, furnishings...even Porta Potties. She did not miss a single detail! I seriously never felt stressed or worried that something would be missed. Lindsey kept me on track and did so with friendly and patient kindness!!! Yay for Lindsey. Would recommend her to anyone planning a wedding event in wine country!!! Our night was so special and memorable and I was able to enjoy it even more because she was there!!!

Lindsey at Lovely Day Events is exceptional! Our daughter was planning a destination wedding in Sonoma and hiring Lindsey was one of the best decisions we made to begin the process...

. Lindsey has the experience and attention to detail that was so important throughout and she has a very well respected group of vendors on her preferred vendor list. She was very easy to work with, is very personable and was dedicated to planning both the wedding day/reception and welcome event and coordinated both events with very talented vendors. Lindsey is very organized, efficient and offered a very detailed timeline as well as monthly check in's through calls and kept us all up to date with emails, which was most helpful in keeping things running smoothly as the planning progressed. The weekend was a very special time for the guests and for us all and an absolute memorable one which far exceeded what we had envisioned! We felt that Lindsey was a part of our family in preparing for the wedding and highly recommend her and the staff at Lovely Day Events.

Lindsey was the only reason we were able to plan our perfect weekend for 150 guests from Denver, CO. We both work a lot but had the vision for our wedding clear. Lindsey understood...

our vibe and made the vision not only reality, but spectacularly more than what we could have even envisioned our weekend to be. She assisted with our welcome event, which we still have people talking about, and our wedding day which people can't stop talking about either! I would recommend her 1,000 times on here if I could! Whether she likes it or not, she is family to us. :) Her professionalism and attention to detail were truly a rare and special thing to experience. For both our amazingly fun welcome event and the gorgeous wedding, we only had to take two trips out and planned everything else over the phone. Both trips were planned expertly by her so we could make decisions and not worry about it back home in Denver. Beyond our vision her suggestions for additional surprises for our guests were perfection and so helpful. We laughed countless times about our ideas just imagining the looks on our guests faces. Our venue choice of Gundlach Bundschu was special to us and it also called for a long list of vendors to make it happen. Her advice throughout the entire process and over our wedding weekend was priceless. I am beyond in debt to her for creating a unique and unforgettable weekend for every single person that attended. It was very important to us that our guests put intention behind the weekend to reconnect with those that they love and to find some true "Michelle and Kevin" style reprieve. We spent our Sunday catching up with guests at a farewell brunch and learned that Lindsey achieved that with flying colors...so much fun was had and so many important connections bonded tightly again. We have had SO many people say these very words to us: "That was by far the best wedding I have ever been to. Class all the way." My heart is full of love, admiration and appreciation beyond words.

Hiring Lindsey and her team at Lovely Day Events was the best investment we made for our destination wedding in Napa! She was prompt, organized and an absolute joy to work with. ...

Our monthly check-ins kept the planning process on pace – helping make decisions, offering ideas, and keeping things organized all while calming my nerves. Our second best decision was using her preferred vendor list. Lindsey is well-respected in the industry – and using her preferred vendors gave us an all-star wedding team. She worked with our vendors so seamlessly that it really felt like they were one team. As our wedding day got closer, the forecast called for rain (for our outdoor wedding). Lindsey jumped into action, giving us several options and ultimately securing a tent three days prior to our event. My wedding day was better than I could have ever imagined – beautiful, fun, organized and CALM. I was able to fully enjoy my day because I knew Lindsey and her team were taking care of every last detail. We were able to spend our day focused on our family, our guest and each other. Hiring Lindsey and Lovely Day Events was the single best decision we made during the planning process!

ime the wedding was a week away, I wasn’t worried about a thing! I kept hearing from family and friends leading up to the big day “you seem really calm for a bride”, and I really owe a huge part of that to Lindsey. Every last detail, down to the most minute of things, Lindsey remembered. I am so grateful to have been able to enjoy my wedding stress free, because in the end, the joy and love is what should be remembered.

imply put, she is THE BEST. Of all the decisions and investments we made throughout the wedding planning process, choosing Lindsey as our planner was by far one of the best. Not only did Lindsey assist with our wedding, she flawlessly executed a welcome party for our 100+ guests the day before. Her organization, attention to detail, and professionalism were invaluable. She truly went above and beyond to ensure we were 100% satisfied with every aspect of our wedding weekend. When we had concerns about a vendor, she made sure we had a Plan B and C lined up, to put any uncertainty to rest. I fully recognized how invaluable Lindsey was when multiple guests remarked how calm I was throughout the entire weekend (something I'm not always known for). Thanks to Lindsey and her team, I was able to completely remove any worry from my mind and fully enjoy every special moment of our wedding. Thank you, Lindsey!
