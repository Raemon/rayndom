Description

2635 Miriam commands the room with a poised, architectural elegance. The clean lines of its square neckline and tank straps frame the décolletage, while the fitted bodice flows seamlessly into a grand pannier-style skirt. Deep pleats release a sweep of stretch Mikado that glides effortlessly, its lustrous surface catching the light with every step. From behind, a dramatic 84-inch cathedral train unfurls, adorned with a perfect row of cascading buttons that trail to the hem in an unbroken line of refinement. Pair with a sleek chignon and statement earrings to balance the gown’s voluminous skirt with a polished, contemporary finish.
