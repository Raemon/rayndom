Lakewood Country Club is both a delightful and convenient venue for gathering family and friends. Though mere minutes from a major airport, the club is tucked away on a quiet residential street, surrounded by 11 verdant acres of golf greens. Built in 1930 when golf was still an elite sport, the club now welcomes the public. Though hints remain throughout the property of its gracious past, Lakewood has been completely updated to accommodate the contemporary couple. Lakewood's historic Spanish-style clubhouse adjoins a sprawling garden lawn encircled by lush foliage. Outdoor ceremonies are lovely on this manicured expanse, with flowering borders and trees providing natural adornment. An archway or the décor of your choice sets the stage for your walk down the aisle. You'll begin your grand entrance from the spacious bridal suite on the second floor of the clubhouse, where you've prepared in comfort and style. A musical cue is your signal to descend an exterior wrought-iron and stone staircase to the garden below. If you prefer a lake view, the first-tee box offers a more intimate space in a gorgeous setting. Following the ceremony, you and your new spouse will be whisked away to pose for photos amid the beautiful lakes and greenery. Meanwhile, guests are invited inside the foyer for cocktails and hors d'oeuvres. This vintage-influenced interior courtyard leads to three separate, and quite different, room options for your reception. Host an impressive gala in the spacious Avalon Ballroom, where your nearest and dearest can celebrate beneath ornate brass chandeliers. Tall windows overlook the golf course, and the view of the emerald fairways is like an artfully rendered landscape painting. More intimate affairs are held in the Hacienda Room, a wonderfully airy and light-filled space, thanks to an open-beamed cathedral ceiling and massive windows overlooking a grassy knoll. For something cozier, the marvelous Fireside Room retains many details of the original building, including a decorative hearth and sliding doors that open onto an outdoor area. With its rustic atmosphere, attention to detail, and competitively priced wedding packages, the Lakewood Country Club deftly answers the needs of today's brides.

I booked this venue for my wedding during the pandemic, and I thought it was a great price for my budget. The lady I worked with at the time (Ashley Snyder) seemed very knowledgeab...

le and nice, but boy, I was in for a surprise. I don't know exactly what has happened to the upper management at this venue in the last two years, but my point of contact/the assigned "event manager" handling all special and private events changed 5 times in the last 6 months leading up to my wedding. Please imagine how stressful that could be on a bride! No one ever contacted me to let me know that my point of contact had changed. I always had to be the one emailing and calling their offices to find out that someone had quit. Because of the constant change in staff, I found myself having to re-explain what I wanted and needed from the venue for my wedding day. I told one event manager (Kevin Carr) all the details of my linen/napkins, chair, and food choices and he made no updates to the system. I only found that out 3 weeks before my wedding date. Additionally, the initial estimate they gave to me nearly DOUBLED when they sent me a "final bill". My jaw dropped to the floor when I saw this, and again I only found this out a month before the wedding date. I had budgeted carefully for my wedding, but I had no where near the amount of money they were asking me for. I had to talk to the current event manager at the time (Jade Kinney), and after an hour long phone call she was able to reduce my final bill down a bit (it was still significantly over the initial estimate though), and she even told me that she wasn't sure why the venue would charge me a $2,000 room rental fee on top of a per-person wedding package fee AND a per-person meal fee. It was absolutely ridiculous. After I "agreed" with Jade on the final bill amount, their billing department never updated the charges on the online portal where I had to make the payments. Then Jade QUIT, and I had to go through this whole debacle again with the new point-of-contact, Stefanie. Stefanie is the head chef there and had to step in as the acting event manager because the venue had nobody else. Their private events office was always closed, and whenever I would call it would go straight to voicemail. No one ever returned my calls, and I even had my wedding cake vendor call me the day before my wedding telling me they had trouble reaching anyone to coordinate the cake drop-off. When I emailed Stefanie to let her know that the vendor was trying to get in contact with her, she simply wrote back "I'm sorry but if they email me I will respond." Absolutely unacceptable, poor customer service. Also, when we showed up for my rehearsal three days prior, there was absolutely no event staff working that day. They were all celebrating the loss of one of their workers, and we were told not to bother them. The only good thing I have to say about this venue is the kitchen/serving staff working that night. I had no complaints about the actual wedding day itself, but ladies if you want to work with a stress-free venue... this is NOT it.

From the beginning when we were deciding on a venue, until the end of the event, Krystina and Angela at Lakewood we’re so professional but personable, accommodating of our schedule...

s, questions, and pop-in visits, and were really a lot of fun to work with. Anything we wanted or questions we had, they were ready to answer. They were so flexible on our wedding day (it was a rainy week, and on the day of, I changed my mind to back outside for the wedding. They had already set up inside). The staff who worked that night were so lovely! Virginia, the room captain, was so nice, always asking us if we needed anything. Lakewood worked with our budget to provide us our vision for the wedding and reception. The grounds were kept nicely (hello, it’s a good course). The bridal suite has all the space you need to get ready. Even the groom’s suite was big. The reception room accommodated 19 tables easily, plus a dance floor, dessert table, cake table, projector table, and a stage for DJ. The entryway was a perfect size for mingling, having drinks, the beverage station, welcome tables, and a photo booth. It was nice to have the bar so close to the room. We really did have a wonderful time here! They have wedding and reception packages for your budget, and they will work with you. The place is pretty. The staff are lovely. Krystina and Angela are awesome!

ersome for asking too many questions but they were very nice and patient with me. My request were pleasantly granted and those that they cannot were politely declined. What I am most grateful about was they were very helpful and suggestive about my ideas. And at the day of my wedding, I was so pleased with how my room and tables turned out! It was a magical day for me and it would not be possible without these ladies. I really appreciate all the hard work that these ladies and their team have done for me. Highly recommended!

without her! The staff was incredibly good at what they do! The service was quick and complete, the food was amazing, the drinks were strong, and every request was fulfilled. Perfect! The preferred vendors work with each other all the time, so that made me feel less stressed about any potential conflicts. They all worked in sync with each other and I was able to be just be a bride instead of focusing on who was where and if the deliveries made it, etc. Would do it all again at Lakewood Country Club if I could!

red all my questions, put me at ease when I was nervous and overall made the experience a pleasant one. Brooke and her team paid close attention to detail so when seeing the ballroom after going over what I wanted, my expectations were exceeded; it was beautiful! Everything about the venue, staff and atmosphere was awesome! I even had a coordinator with me before walking down the aisle to calm my nerves. I begged Brooke to stay and party with us but, of course, she couldn't (even though I know she would have had a blast!) She was there through the ceremony and a little bit of the reception so she got to see some of her amazing work! All my family and friends had a blast and continue to tell me how beautiful it was. My wedding was unforgettable and I owe it to them!

one of our side items. Another problem was that they never informed us when staff was changed. We had three different consultants work on our wedding and details would get lost in translation. Other than that, the staff during the event was wonderfully amazing! They also kept good contact with us and worked with us to give us the perfect day.

Lakewood Country Club was the only venue that caught our interest from beginning to end; we've looked at least 10 other venues throughout Orange County, Long Beach, and Torrance. ...

The staffs assisted us in a professional, friendly, and comfortable way. Gave us ideas and suggestions, and still make it ours. They are pros at what they do, and includes us on all events. The facility is gorgeous and clean. We had steak and chicken and open bar for 2 hours. They were not cheap about the servings, and received more than expected. Our guests were still talking about how good it was, even after a month. They made us look good! Our expectations were exceedingly met in every aspect. Memories to last a lifetime. I definitely recommend Lakewood Country Club for any special event.

she answered all my questions fairly quickly. More importantly, the day of our wedding was beautiful! The venue was clean and beautifully set-up. The bakery they work with is awesome too, our cake was delicious. The LCC catering and wait-staff worked hard to make our event a success. There was another wedding reception at the same time as ours, but it didn't interfere with our event in the least. Neither did any lingering golfers from the afternoon. We got to taste all the food before we chose it, which was hard because everything was SO GOOD! But it was comforting to know exactly what we were going to be serving our guests. They definitely didn't disappoint. Sometimes food served to large groups can be...gross. But everyone told us, even after our event, how good the food was.

Would definitely recommend this place for a one stop shop. I really also loved the wedding expo they hosted earlier in the year. Got a couple vendors at that event.

My husband and I got married at the Lakewood Country Club and I cannot say enough good things about the venue or the people. The venue was always pristine and Katelyn, Natalie, and...

the entire crew were super helpful, always followed up in a timely manner, and made sure everything turned out as planned. The reception room looked gorgeous and was set up exactly as we agreed. The package we purchased included many items so we did not have to look for many vendors on our own. The cake, flowers, and photographer (all vendors we booked through the Lakewood Country Club) delivered excellent products. Even when it came to the small details there were a lot of decisions to be made that my husband and I may not have originally thought about. However, Katelyn and Natalie helped us make the right choices. Even though I was too excited to eat on the day of the wedding, the little food I did have was absolutely delicious! Everything we chose we were able to try at the food tasting months ahead of time and everything was perfect then so I know it was for the wedding as well. Jenalynn (I apologize that I probably did not spell her name correctly!) was amazing! She helped us on the day of the wedding and was super sweet, friendly, and very attentive. When I asked for the cheese and crackers platter it was in the bridal suite before I knew it. She attended to me and my bridesmaid with the utmost professionalism. When the ceremony started she even described the processional to me because I couldn't quite see it from where I was standing : ) I felt very comfortable having her with me. Of course, price is always a huge factor in deciding where to get married. I have to be honest that I was hesitant about even looking at the Lakewood Country Club as a wedding venue because I assumed that any country club would be expensive. However, LCC was actually the best priced venue of all the places we'd seen. It was also the most "user-friendly" because so many of the proven and qualified vendors were chosen for us. All you have to do is call them and tell them what you want. Everything is included in one price at the club, so you don't have to worry about sending payments to a multitude of different companies. The LCC made my dream wedding come true. You will not be disappointed if you book your wedding with them. Happy Wedding! : )

Everything was great! The wedding packages include pretty basic center pieces ( we used theirs and added to it) and floral arrangements for your arch. Oh the cake is also included!...

And the grand ball room has these giant windows that display the golf course and the ceiling already has the swag with light in it.We created our Own menu and the food was off the hook; it's been a month now and people are still talking about it lol. Natalie (the event coordinator) and her team were perfect. They were very patient with us and so sweet. Natalie was on vacation the day of my wedding but she face timed us to make sure everything was going good, assure us that everything would be fine and to congratulate Us one last time, I thought that was pretty Dope! The one con was that their outside vendors were pricey. Chair covers were $4 per chair, and we had 140 ppl. $560 on just chair covers?? absolutely Not!

The girls helped out, gave suggestions and entertained my craziness. But mostly they listened. They are very easy to talk to and approachable. We had two events. A breakfast/rehearsal a week before the wedding. It was wonderful. Need I say more... Everything was perfect! We didn't want it to end. I want to create an event just to have it at Lakewood Country Club. Love this place!!! No words can ever say how much our day meant to us. It's because of great places like this, that make a Bride's dreams come true. Mine's did!!!
