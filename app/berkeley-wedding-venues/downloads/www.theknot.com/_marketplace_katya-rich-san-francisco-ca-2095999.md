Katya was the absolute GOAT for our wedding day! Our first HMUA cancelled last minute and I reached out to Katya who responded quickly and she was able to confirm she could cover u...

s on our wedding day. She laid out all her tips to prep our hair/faces and arrived early to get set up. She took our inspo pics into consideration and checked in with us if our hair and makeup was looking like we expected. She also gave us touch up kits to fix Bobby pins, oils, and lips throughout the day. Makeup and hair stayed great getting ready, ceremony, picture time, and dinner!!! Katya was so organized and most of all had great communication skills and personality. She was so sweet, asking us how we met, sharing about her life, and it was very easy to feel comfortable around her. I can’t say enough how much we appreciated every small thing she did to make a stressful situation, stress-free. Thank you thank you thank you!

My experience with Katya began with a bridal makeup trial at her studio, where I immediately felt her refined approach and exceptional artistry. Trusting her vision was the best de...

cision I could have made — she has an incredible eye for beauty and an intuitive understanding of what works best for each individual. On my wedding day, Katya came to my hotel, creating a calm, seamless, and truly luxurious experience from start to finish. My makeup was flawless, timeless, and beautifully executed. It photographed perfectly, lasted all day, and made me feel confident, radiant, and like the best version of myself. I received countless compliments throughout the day. Katya’s professionalism, attention to detail, and elevated aesthetic are unmatched. She doesn’t simply apply makeup — she delivers an exceptional, high-end experience. I cannot recommend her highly enough and am beyond grateful to have had her as part of such an important day.

I felt completely comfortable in her hands, and she truly knocked out of the park. My hair and make up came out even better than I expected. It was beautiful and intentional and perfectly suited to me. I wore the look for over 12 hours through a full performance day, and everything held up flawlessly. Beyond the results, the experience itself was such a joy. Katya brings a warm, confident energy that makes the entire process feel effortless and fun. I would hire her again in a heartbeat and recommend her without hesitation!

I loved working with Katya. I honestly can’t imagine what I would have done without her. Not only is she a wonderful makeup artist with incredible attention to detail and real car...

e for her craft, she also captured behind-the-scenes b-roll on her phone during the shoot, which ended up being so helpful for other assets I needed. Her presence is both gentle and strong, and above all, incredibly giving. We had to change locations and she offered to drive me in her car with all of my stuff, and then even drove me home afterward. I was genuinely blown away by that generosity. We chatted on the drive and I learned more about her story—she’s a powerful person and it’s clear she’s going places. I can’t wait to see what she accomplishes next, and I will definitely be hiring her again for future shoots.

On the wedding day, she and her assistant took care of me, my MIL, and two of my bridesmaids. They were on time and came very prepared. We were done earlier than our anticipated end time and she even came to the venue to do some touch ups before I put my dress on. She made me feel so special and like a true princess. The makeup and hair lasted all day long, and all through the dancing. I cannot recommend Katya and her team enough!! Thank you, Katya!

eam absolutely nailed it. I first met Katya and her team member Jane for my engagement photos. Katya would not be available herself for my wedding day, but she was fully committed to making sure that Jane had everything she needed to accomplish my wedding day hair and makeup. Jane was an absolute pleasure to work with. She was friendly and professional. When my handmade hair pins took longer than expected to place, she nevertheless took the time to make everything perfect. My hair and makeup held through hours outside in the sun, a hundred hugs, and dancing. Thank you Rich Beauty Studio!
