Working with Rona was one of the best choices I made for my wedding! I had less than 5 months to plan my entire wedding, and she was quick, responsive and wonderful to work with. O...

n our first call she said, “we are going to have fun” and it was! I had a church ceremony and a reception in a different location. She was able to set up both venues seamlessly and transported the altar pieces to my reception space as well! I gave her my budget and asked what she could do with that. She created a vision board and asked if she could get a little creative and she DELIVERED exactly what I wanted and brought my inspiration to life! I would recommend her for anyone getting married in the Bay Area

There is no one better then Rona! I got married last weekend in Lake Tahoe and Rona was our florist. When I say this is the florist for you I MEAN IT! She goes above and beyond for...

her couples and you will not be disappointed. My wedding got rescheduled 4 times due to COVID. I had 3 different venues cancel on me throughout the last year and ended up having my wedding 200+ miles away from where I live and R Flowers business location. She still pulled it off seamlessly, even with having 2 different locations for our ceremony and reception. Look no further you have found the perfect florist!
