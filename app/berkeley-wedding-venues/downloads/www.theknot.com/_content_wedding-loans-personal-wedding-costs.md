## How Do Wedding Loans Work?

Wedding loans are for engaged couples who need help financing their weddings. This is another payment option rather than using credit cards or cash. However, in the eyes of banks, a "wedding loan" isn't an official entity. You can't walk into a bank and request a wedding loan. Wedding loans are actually personal loans from lenders wherein the funds are used to cover wedding expenses.

## Can You Get a Loan for a Wedding?

Yes, engaged couples can acquire personal loans for wedding expenses. According to [The Knot Real Weddings Study](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-data-insights/real-weddings-study), 67% of couples last year said that cost/ budget were the most important priorities while wedding planning. However, financing a wedding through a personal loan is a significant financial decision and one that shouldn't be made lightly. Financial experts urge caution for folks looking into wedding loans. "Taking out a personal loan is kind of a last-ditch effort," says [Lauren Lyons Cole](https://twitter.com/laurenlyonscole?lang=en), a Certified Financial Planner and former writer for _Business Insider_. "The problem with personal loans is that people often take them out because they're trying to spend cash they don't have. I would also lump in credit card spending here because I think many people pay for wedding-related things with a credit card, but they may or may not have the cash to pay it off in full," Lyons Cole adds. Despite Lyons Cole's cautions, wedding loans are an option for those interested in borrowing money for their wedding budget. .

## Pros and Cons of Wedding Loans

Now that you know you can finance a wedding with a loan, it's time to answer the really important question. _Should_ you take out a personal loan for your wedding? Keep reading to learn the main pros and cons of this decision.

### Pros of Wedding Loans

Not everything about wedding financing is scary. Here are some of the main pros of applying for a wedding loan.

  * Personal loans for weddings are a convenient way to get money. As you start planning your wedding, you'll discover your venue and vendors expect upfront deposits to book their space and services. These costs can add up quickly, especially when you add your wedding dress and accessories into the mix. If you don't have a chunk of money sitting around in your savings account, a marriage loan can give you the cash you need to cover your deposits.
  * They're easy to get. In many cases, you can apply for your wedding loan online in minutes once you get your financial documents in order. Your bank or loan provider will review your application and, if you're approved, will deposit your loan amount directly into your account.
  * You'll get your money quickly. Most lenders can review your application, approve it and deposit your loan amount in a few days. Some lenders even promise loan funding in 24 hours.
  * Wedding loans can have better interest rates than credit cards. If you have a good credit score and a strong credit history, chances are you can get a marriage loan with an interest rate lower than your credit cards.
  * Some loans don't charge for prepayments. Some loans will allow you to pay off your loan early without penalty fees, which can decrease interest costs. If you plan on paying off your loan with cash gifts from wedding guests or if parents or other family members have offered to help fund your big day, you may not have to pay any interest at all. Double-check the language of your loan to make sure prepayments are allowed.
  * You may improve your credit score. Couples looking to build or improve their credit can work to boost their score by successfully paying their marriage loan. Make sure not to miss payments or make late ones. A strong credit score will make it easier to get loans in the future and keep your interest rates low.



### Cons of Wedding Loans

We wouldn't feel right telling you about all the pros without warning you about the cons of wedding loans. These are a few things you need to look out for if you're considering wedding loans.

  * Interest, interest, interest! By taking out a loan for your wedding, you'll be paying interest on the loan. For example, if you take out a five-year loan for $15,000 at a 10% interest rate, you'll end up paying over $4,000 in interest throughout the loan. You and your partner will need to decide if incurring the additional cost from interest over the long term aligns with your financial goals as a couple. 
  * We always encourage [discussing debt before marriage](https://www.theknot.com/content/discussing-debt-before-wedding), especially if you're going to take out a wedding loan. Money troubles are a common cause of relationship stress. Consider whether you want to start this new and exciting chapter of your life with a monthly loan payment?
  * Existing loans make it difficult to qualify for new ones. Are you thinking of buying a new car or home after your wedding? When a bank considers giving you a loan, they'll look at your existing loans to determine if you can afford the new loan. If you have a lot of existing loans, the bank may not give you a loan for the amount you want, or they may deny your loan altogether.
  * They could make you spend more. Getting the money for your wedding loan in your bank account could make you feel flush with cash. You may feel more comfortable upgrading your floral arrangements, choosing that dress that's out of budget or inviting a few more people to your wedding. All of these upgrades add up.



The decision to take out a loan for your wedding is one you must make with your partner because it'll affect financial decisions in your marriage later. It's important to talk about whether or not that financial burden is something you want to deal with when you get back from the honeymoon.

## How to Get a Loan for a Wedding

With the [average cost of a wedding](https://www.theknot.com/content/average-wedding-cost) sitting at $33,000, it's understandable that you're wondering how much of that cost you can cover with a wedding personal loan. Many wedding loan options offer financing from $1,000 to $75,000. Here are three steps you need to take to get a loan for your celebration. 

### Ensure you have good credit.

If you want a wedding loan, you'll have to ensure your financials are in order. Traditionally, the biggest factor is your credit score. Anything above 700 is usually considered a good credit score. However, you can still get a loan with a lower score. Some lending websites require a score of 620 or higher. To figure out your credit score, try a _trusted_ free credit score site or use your bank's app to see your score.

### Have your financial documents in order.

Beyond the credit score, your institution will want to look at your proof of income, bank statements and any other debt you might have (like student loans or mortgages). You'll have to check with your institution to find what specific documents and qualifications you'll need. In other words, online wedding loans require many of the same types of documentation as any other loan. "At Upstart, they worked hard to automate much of the process. This makes applying for a loan incredibly simple and fast. The customer service team is also available to help every step of the way," Byun explains.

### Apply for a wedding loan through a financial institution.

You can apply for the wedding loan as an individual or with your partner. Determine this decision based on whether your credit score is better than the joint one and if you would like to share the responsibility of the loan. Once you have your credit and documents in order, apply for the loan in person or online. Then, your desired financial institution will take it from there.

### Use an online personal loan company.

Lots of internet loan companies have sprung up over the past few years, and most offer crowd-sourced loans. Here's how it works: Online investors front money for you once you've been approved by the company similar to how you'd be approved by a bank. Then, you pay them back, including interest, in the same way you would a bank.

## Wedding Loans to Consider

If you've decided that a loan is your preferred method for covering wedding expenses you'll need to find the best wedding loan option for you. Here is a look at some wedding loan lenders worth considering. 

  * **Upstart** : [Upstart](https://upstart.9c65.net/PyvPNX) is an online lending marketplace that partners with banks to provide personal loans ranging from $1,000–$75,000. "Upstart offers three and five-year loans with no prepayment penalty. You can decide what amount and term length you and your partner are most comfortable with," says Jungwon Byun, Co-Founder and COO of [Elicit](https://elicit.com/) and former Head of Growth at Upstart. This website allows you to safely fill in your information and shows you the types of loans (and the personal loan rates) you qualify for. "Unless you can pay off the monthly balance immediately, credit cards aren't a great option for long-term debt," Byun advises. "The Upstart platform is smart; it uses education, employment and credit history to determine the APR. The entire process is also online and very simple, which makes it a fast and easy way to borrow."
  * **Credit Karma:** [Credit Karma ](https://www.creditkarma.com/lp/weddingexpenses)is a personal loan lender that many folks select for wedding expenses. Their personal loans typically come with fixed monthly payments that make managing repayment less stressful. Additionally, many applicants are able to get funds within three business days. Additionally, because Credit Karma offers many other financial services tools (from mortgage loans to credit cards and even tax support) it is a great option for couples who want to streamline their finances by having fewer accounts at different financial institutions. 
  * **MaxLend:**[MaxLend](https://www.maxlend.com/) notably doesn't have an early pay-off penalty, meaning that you can pay off your loan early without incurring additional fees. MaxLend is great for folks who want a smaller loan with a shorter repayment periods—their loans max out at $3,750 and often have a nine-month repayment period. 
  * **Axos Bank:** One the fence about a wedding loan? [Axos Bank](https://www.axosbank.com/personal) boasts preliminary offers that will not impact your credit score (a great option if you're still considering whether a wedding loan is right for you). Axos Bank personal loans range from $7,000 to $50,000 with terms ranging from three to six years. They don't require collateral, have no pre-payment penalties, and funding is generally available within one to two business days of acceptance of the final offer.



## Alternatives to Wedding Loans

Don't feel like you have to turn to a wedding loan to pay for every element in your [wedding budget breakdown](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-budget-ways-to-save-money). Once you understand the [why behind wedding costs](https://www.theknot.com/content/why-are-weddings-so-expensive), you'll quickly realize that there are many ways to save and cut wedding costs. We know budgeting for the wedding can be arduous, and some things are too cool not to have, but starting your future in debt is not a good way to kick off your marriage. Below are a few ways to cover costs without taking a loss.

### Take out a home equity line of credit.

This one is only for homeowners and usually for parents paying for their children's nuptials. The idea behind a home equity line of credit is you borrow against the mortgage on your home. Again, though, it's not a good idea. Neither the financial experts nor we would recommend doing such a thing. "I've seen parents take out a home equity line of credit, which is basically borrowing against the value of your home," says Lyons Cole. "Especially for a lot of parents, if you're throwing a wedding, you're probably mid-40s to 50s, you're not that far away from retirement, you probably just put your kid through college—there are so many expenses and pressures put on a parent, and chances are you need that money for something else," Lyons Cole adds.

### Use a credit card.

We should warn you most financial advisers are wary of credit cards and lines of credit when it comes to alternative ways to pay for your wedding. For Lyons Cole, this is one of the fastest ways to get into deep debt. "Obviously, as a financial planner, my advice would always be to create a budget and only pay for things you can afford," says Lyons Cole. That said, if (and only if) you have the cash to pay for your wedding, a credit card can be a good option. The [best wedding credit cards](https://www.theknot.com/content/best-credit-cards-for-wedding-planning) will protect your money from fraud and help you earn points for flights and hotels (hello, honeymoon).

### Extend your engagement and save for the wedding. 

This is hands down our favorite option. Avoid wedding loans by taking the time to create a wedding budget and then learn [how to save money for your wedding](https://www.theknot.com/content/ways-to-save-money-on-wedding). (Psst: Our free budget tool uses real pricing data to help you learn about the factors that influence wedding costs and provides you with helpful savings tips.) There's no harm in a long engagement. Many venues are already booked more than a year in advance anyway. "I would rather have you postpone your engagement six months to a year to save money. Paying forward by saving is much better than paying backward with debt," Lyons Cole says.

### Work with a financial advisor. 

If you still aren't sure about the best way to approach your finances and wedding budget, it's time to speak with a professional advisor. Enlist the services of a financial advisor to get customized advice that is tailored to your specific needs and goals. [Domain Money](https://domainmoney.pxf.io/c/64733/1150126/14535?subId1=TK-wedding-loans-personal-wedding-costs&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.domainmoney.com) and [Monarch Money](https://monarchmoney.sjv.io/c/64733/1181531/14860?subId1=TK-wedding-loans-personal-wedding-costs&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.monarchmoney.com) are two online financial planning services that engaged couples can consider.
