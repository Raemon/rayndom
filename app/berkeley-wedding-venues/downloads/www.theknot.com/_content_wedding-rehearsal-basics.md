Updated Sep 08, 2025

There's an undeniable excitement that comes with planning your wedding. But couples often get more than a single day to celebrate—they get several. As tradition recommends, it's customary to host a rehearsal dinner the night before the wedding to honor your most VIP guests. But what is a rehearsal dinner, exactly? While it's not as major as the wedding itself, a rehearsal supper is still an important event that you don't want to overlook or leave to the last minute. With help from a few wedding industry experts, we're answering all the basic questions, from who's responsible for [planning the rehearsal dinner](https://www.theknot.com/content/planning-a-rehearsal-dinner) and when it takes place to who attends.

**In this article:**What Is a Rehearsal Dinner? | Itinerary & Activities | Basics | Tips

## **What Is a Rehearsal Dinner?**

Traditionally, the rehearsal dinner is a meal following the practice run (or rehearsal) of the wedding ceremony. It takes place on the eve of the wedding day (less commonly a day or two earlier, depending on your schedule) and is the final prewedding event before the couple is married. On top of giving the couple some quality time with loved ones, the rehearsal dinner is a chance for both families to gather and kick off the wedding festivities—an ideal way to introduce relatives and friends who haven't met before.

[READ MORE Affordable Rehearsal Dinner Ideas on a Budget ](https://www.theknot.com/content/affordable-rehearsal-dinner-ideas)

"The rehearsal dinner provides couples a time to host a private celebration in honor of their wedding party, parents and other immediate family members and friends," says Tara Melvin, owner and event planner at [Signature Concepts](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/signature-concepts-woodbridge-va-242694) in Woodbridge, Virginia. "It allows them to unite, reflect and celebrate right before emerging into an ocean of individuals that they may or may not have the opportunity to engage in conversation on the big day."

Though it's tough to find an official rehearsal dinner history or pinpoint exactly when they became part of the wedding experience, Thomas Waters—owner and event coordinator at [The Renaissance](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/the-renaissance-richmond-va-362900), a wedding venue in downtown Richmond, Virginia—says that rehearsal dinners probably started gaining popularity in the 1950s when weddings went from small church ceremonies or backyard parties and instead became entire productions that took months to plan. As weddings became more lavish and ornate, the need to have a ceremony rehearsal and gather your wedding party and family members became more critical.  
  
"With this wedding explosion, there was no choice but to get everyone together to rehearse the ceremony so it goes smoothly," Waters says. "Throw in the fact that [rehearsal dinner photographers](https://www.theknot.com/content/rehearsal-dinner-photography-tips) and videographers are now a very normal thing, and it increases the importance of everyone being in the right place at the right time."

## **What Happens at a Rehearsal Dinner?**

The rehearsal dinner is when the couple's families and wedding party come together to share a meal, give toasts and get to know each other before the to-be-weds say "I do." It's also when last-minute details are confirmed and gifts are exchanged with the wedding party.

During the [rehearsal dinner meal](https://www.theknot.com/content/rehearsal-dinner-menu), it's tradition for the couple to make a short toast, as well as anyone who isn't giving a [wedding speech](https://www.theknot.com/content/rehearsal-dinner-speeches-vs-reception-speeches) on the big day. The rehearsal _dinner_ is different from the rehearsal _ceremony_ , but the two events are usually scheduled back-to-back and often referred to interchangeably. 

During the dinner portion, the main priority is for the couple to spend time with their closest loved ones. One or both sets of parents may choose to give a toast at the rehearsal dinner, and the couple will thank everyone for joining them before presenting gifts to the wedding party (if they're not giving gifts on the day of the wedding).

Following the ceremony rehearsal, the rehearsal dinner is meant to be much more relaxed. You don't need to follow a minute-by-minute schedule (there will be enough of that on the wedding day), but you should make time for everything you want to cover. Toward the end of the dinner, the couple should plan to give their brief [rehearsal dinner speech](https://www.theknot.com/content/rehearsal-dinner-speech) and present gifts to the members of their wedding party. The dinner might conclude with a quick toast by the host(s) and a video or photo slideshow to surprise the couple.

## **Wedding Rehearsal Dinner Basics**

You might know the basics of a rehearsal supper, but chances are you still have plenty of questions—like who's in charge of planning it and how the [rehearsal dinner cost](https://www.theknot.com/content/average-cost-rehearsal-dinner) is handled. Don't worry, we're breaking it all down for you, from location to timing, along with some creative [rehearsal dinner ideas](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-rehearsals-10-fun-ideas) to help you plan a smooth and unforgettable celebration.

**Rehearsal dinner logistics & etiquette:** When to Have It | How Long It Lasts | Who Pays | Where to Have | Who Attends | How to Invite

### **When is the rehearsal dinner?**

The rehearsal dinner typically takes place the afternoon or evening before the wedding day. Depending on your [venue's availability](https://www.theknot.com/content/where-to-rehearse-ceremony-if-venue-isnt-available), it may need to be a couple of days earlier or take place in the morning instead of the evening. Since the point of the rehearsal is to give your wedding party time to practice the ceremony, try to schedule it as close to the wedding as possible so that it's still fresh in everyone's minds.

### **How long does a rehearsal dinner last?**

If you're asking yourself, "How long do rehearsal dinners last?" it's probably not as long as you think. Following the run-through of the ceremony, which usually lasts about an hour, the rehearsal dinner lasts about two or three hours more. Some couples choose to extend the rehearsal dinner with an after-party or welcome party for the rest of their guests. In general, you want to avoid going too late into the night. Remember: You have an early wake-up call for your wedding day.

### **Who pays for the rehearsal dinner?**

You may have heard the rehearsal dinner referred to as the [groom's dinner](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-rehearsals-etiquette), but don't let the name fool you—it's not all about the groom. This is because, traditionally, the [groom's parents pay](https://www.theknot.com/content/what-grooms-family-traditionally-pays-for) and host the rehearsal supper (in bride-groom partnerships). However, some couples may not include anyone who identifies as a groom, not to mention that more and more couples are paying for their own weddings. Commonly, if one set of parents is paying for the wedding, the other set may offer to pay for the rehearsal dinner. Ultimately, however, the final decision is up to you.

"Modern couples who are assuming the investment of their wedding usually take on the rehearsal dinner," says Melvin. Alternatively, you can decide that all of the parents or a group of people will collectively share the responsibility of [paying for the rehearsal dinner](https://www.theknot.com/content/mandatory-wedding-rehearsal-dinner).

### **Where do you have the rehearsal dinner?**

When it comes to where to have a rehearsal dinner, it's ideal to choose a place near your wedding venue since you'll be rehearsing your ceremony immediately beforehand. You should also consider how many people will be attending before you start contacting [rehearsal dinner venues](https://www.theknot.com/content/booking-your-rehearsal-dinner-venue). If you only have a small group of wedding party members and loved ones, you can probably get away with booking a couple of tables at a restaurant or renting out a section of a swanky cocktail bar. For larger groups, you might need to turn to other party venues, such as a hotel banquet room or reception hall. 

Head to [The Knot Vendor Marketplace](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/rehearsal-dinners-bridal-showers) to find rehearsal dinner venues near you, which you can filter by price, guest capacity and style. If you can find a rehearsal dinner venue that holds special meaning to you as a couple, that's even better—maybe you have a favorite restaurant you go to every Friday night or there's a local spot that serves cuisine reflective of your cultures.

[Find a Rehearsal Dinner Venue](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/rehearsal-dinners-bridal-showers)

### **Who attends the rehearsal dinner?**

The [rehearsal dinner guest list](https://www.theknot.com/content/who-should-be-invited-to-rehearsal-dinner) should be fairly limited—remember that this isn't a welcome party or an event where everyone needs to be included. Invite anyone who's participating in the wedding ceremony, including bridesmaids, groomsmen, flower girls, ring bearers, ushers and readers. Parents and immediate relatives, such as grandparents and aunts or uncles you're close with, should also be on the list. Finally, it's a nice gesture to extend an invitation to any [wedding party plus-ones](https://www.theknot.com/content/plus-one-etiquette-guide), as well as your officiant and their plus-one.

### **Should you send rehearsal dinner invitations?**

Since you've likely already spent a pretty penny on the wedding invitations, you may opt out of sending official printed stationery for the wedding rehearsal dinner, which is totally okay. "The rehearsal dinner is meant to be a more casual event, and a personal invitation goes a long way in connecting families and friends," says Keith Willard, owner and wedding planner at [Keith Willard Events](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/keith-willard-events-fort-lauderdale-fl-1041879) in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. "If there is an invitation, it could be confused with a welcome reception, which is different from a rehearsal dinner," he adds.

Instead of sending paper invites, Willard says that a phone call or virtual invitation is just as helpful. But if you do choose to send [rehearsal dinner invitations](https://www.theknot.com/content/rehearsal-dinner-invitation-ideas), they should look different from your actual wedding invitations. Find event-specific rehearsal stationery on [The Knot Invitations](https://www.theknot.com/paper/invitations/rehearsal-dinner) that matches your rehearsal dinner vibe. 

Clearly outline the timing for the event, when people should arrive for the ceremony rehearsal and when dinner will begin, along with addresses for both locations. RSVP instructions and optional food choice should also be covered, and all details—regardless of whether you decide to do paper or digital invitations—should be [included on your wedding website](https://www.theknot.com/content/what-to-put-on-your-wedding-website) so VIP guests have access to the info.

## **Rehearsal Supper Tips From the Pros**

Your rehearsal dinner is a good opportunity to treat your loved ones to a special prewedding celebration, but there are also some practical aspects to it. Below, we've outlined some [rehearsal dinner mistakes](https://www.theknot.com/content/rehearsal-dinner-rules-you-can-break) to avoid so you can ensure that everything goes off without a hitch (so to speak).

### **1\. Don't make it impersonal.**

Your rehearsal dinner should be an extension of your wedding day. We're not talking about going overboard with flowers or [rehearsal dinner decorations](https://www.theknot.com/content/rehearsal-dinner-decorations) (unless you want to), but the rehearsal supper should reflect your love story as much as the big day itself. Even though it's not the main event, the rehearsal dinner is still important, and there are ways to personalize it so that it feels just as special. Name a signature drink after your pet or have table names inspired by places you've visited. "You'd be surprised at how little things like that will be the most memorable things that the guests will take away with them," says Waters.

Wondering how best to remember the ideas for personalization you see across rehearsal dinner content on The Knot? Once you've created an account with The Knot, you can save images, articles and more by clicking the small heart icon you see (it's in the upper-right of most images in articles). This will save the content to [your favorites folder](https://www.theknot.com/your-favorites/inspiration) so you can easily access it. 

### **2\. Don't let guests feel left out.**

The rehearsal dinner is an excellent time for family and close friends to gather before the busy schedule of a wedding day, so conversation and quality time should be top priorities. To ensure everyone is at ease and enjoying themselves, take time to introduce family and friends who haven't met before. It will make all the difference when everyone's celebrating together the following day.

### **3\. Avoid an all-nighter.**

Since the next day—your wedding day!—will be a busy one, the rehearsal dinner isn't the time to have an all-night rager. Willard suggests beginning at a reasonable hour and, more importantly, ending at a reasonable time. "For most rehearsal dinners, I allocate two hours at maximum," he says. "This will give your guests a marker for when it is OK to leave and reduces the opportunity to overindulge in both food and drink."

### **4\. Don't forget to savor the time with your loved ones.**

During the rehearsal dinner, Waters encourages couples to make an effort to approach every guest to share a moment with them, paying extra attention to loved ones who have traveled from out of town. "Let them know how happy you are that they could make it and how excited you are to see them, especially if you haven't shared space with them in a while," says Waters.

The rehearsal dinner is also a special time to revel in the moment and enjoy being surrounded by friends and family, even the ones who you see regularly. Your wedding day will go by in the blink of an eye, so it's all the more meaningful to pause, take photos and make memories.
