iting and composition, and they matched that perfectly. when I talked to them, everything was simple and clear—no hidden stuff, no stress, just straight answers and open-minded people. I even watched the webinar and I’m glad I did, not only because we got the complimentary album but also because it showed me they were the right team for our wedding. as a groom, I’ll be honest—I didn’t care that much about photos at first, but I knew I wanted to work with them. and I’m so glad I did. they did an amazing job, my wife is really happy (which is the most important thing), and the photos are great. I especially love the party shots—they’re fun, real, and just awesome. they worked fast, we got to enjoy the whole day without stress, and we still have incredible memories to look back on. thank you guys, you’re GREAT.

nk I've got a discerning eye. Christian's portfolio stood out to me because of his consistent grasp of exposure, the immense range of tones without losing detail in either end of the spectrum, and his balance of technical expertise with timing. The latter can't be taught, it's something that needs to be felt, and only an outstanding photographer has mastery of the science and the art. My husband told me, "Sometimes you have a certain look when you're looking at me. It's hard to explain, but I feel like Christian was able to capture it." I agree with him and feel the same way. We will cherish our images for a lifetime. I wish Christian all the best in his prolific business, and sincerely hope his many administrative duties never diminish his enjoyment of his profession. We were privileged to work directly with him and are so grateful. Love, Emily and Darren McMahon 10-20-24 The Barns at Wesleyan Hills Middletown Connecticut

hat he does. He wasn’t just the guy with the camera—he was part of the excitement. His approach was really hands-off and relaxed, which made it feel like we were just hanging out with a friend rather than posing for pictures. What really stood out was how Jeff made sure to capture not just the “main events” but all the little moments that made the day unforgettable. Whether it was a quiet moment during the vows or a burst of laughter from the guests, he had this amazing ability to catch the raw emotion without ever being in the way. The photos were full of life—nothing felt stiff or forced. The video was just as good! It wasn’t just a recap of the day—it was a full-on cinematic experience. The way Jeff edited it, with the right music and pacing, made it feel like a highlight reel that you’d want to watch over and over. Honestly, it was so good, we all cried watching it!

The photographer had a remarkable ability to make me feel comfortable, allowing my natural happiness and personality to shine through in every shot.

The final images were delivered promptly and exceeded all expectations. The subtle yet impactful editing enhanced the pbeyindwithout compromising their authenticity. Friends and family have been raving about the vibrant tones and how the pictures seem to tell a story effortlessly.

I trusted them and I didn’t stress out and I let them do their thing and wow my photos came out great. Hands down the best vendor I hired for my wedding. I am very picky and panicky and I spent countless days looking for the best photographer and I kept coming back to this one.

nds are very impressed with the photos. We received very easy and comfortable direction and we didn’t worry about a single thing which is what we wanted. I feel that they adapted to us very easily and we received a lot of edited photos to choose from. We are recommending them for the rest of our lives <3

As a bride who researched constantly for weeks and weeks I must say I kept coming back to this company for the quality of work. Me and my now husband paid for the wedding ourselves...

and one thing we wanted was an amazing photographer. I showed my friends his work and other photographers just to get a different opinion and they all agreed he was the best in the area. When he came to my wedding me and my bridesmaids felt comfortable instantly. He was so sweet and unobstructive. He didn’t require much attention at all and thank god for that because I didnt wan’t a needy or awkward photographer. I think he read me well and adapted to me easily. My photos were gorgeous and we ended up ordering an album too which was so well made and beautiful. We had such a good time during our wedding we even offered him a drink and invited him to dance with us. He was so fun. He had some sort of compact Polaroid printer that day and printed me some polaroids with the photos he took that day with his professional camera and gave a few to my parents as a surprise. My mom cried when she saw the polaroids. He handled people very well during the group photos and this requires a lot of control especially with my drunk friends and he did it so naturally.

We booked Christian for our wedding because we loved his work and saw the reviews. We were glad we did because he was fantastic to work with on the wedding day. He had great ideas ...

for artistic flare to make our pictures one of a kind. The unedited pictures we saw the day of on the camera were amazing, so we cannot wait see the actual pictures. We did a first look on the beach, and he and Kristen (we asked for a 2nd photographer too) made sure to get everyone out of the way and align us to capture this very special moment perfectly. On top of it they were great to work with! We didn’t even realize they were there, as they let us enjoy our moment. Christian and Kristen were great to work with, and Christian was always incredible about getting back quickly to all of our questions leading up. He is very focused on getting perfect shots, and gives many suggestions along the way to capture natural and genuine moments. Helped to make our day relaxed and special. Can’t wait to see the pictures.

for a wedding photographer ... and I couldn't find a better one. I hired him and annoyed him with tons of emails... then I realized that all I had to do from the beginning was relax and let him handle the photography side of things. He is an expert, a master, an icon in the business and I dear you to find someone better. He is also so fun!

estment because of the quality of his work. The photos were exactly how I imagine remembering my wedding day for the rest of my life, and honestly it gave me that fairy tail look I've been imaging since I was a little girl! After all, our photos are the one thing my husband and I really have to represent our wedding to friends and family who couldn't make the event and for years to come. So having a journalistic style documentation was really important to us. And we also wanted photos that were just breathtakingly beautiful, so we could get them printed large format to hang on the wall in our new house. Christian was able to set us up with a book order and the quality large prints we wanted. Christian is really professional, helpful and super fun to work with too! Having him at the wedding made the quests have more fun because of his personality and making people laugh on camera. We are so happy that there are pictures of us, AND of our guests. We LOVE our photos!

fficult to be on camera and I'm not a modal at all lol, and Christian was able to guide the shoot and make us feel comfortable, and the photos looked amazing! He also is able to tell you exactly how to pose, in order to capture that really naturally romantic look you want for your engagement pictures, which really stands out on film. Christian's willingness to go to great lengths to get the best shot, like lying on the ground, climbing through bushes, traveling to a specific location etc, and all of the photos have an gorgeous composition, and very natural look. We felt like we were treated like his best friends at the shoot and he took the time to get to know us over the phone before the shoot and answer any questions we had. Also, the turnaround time is so fast, where as most photographers take months to get your photos back to you. He is a really fun but professional photographer to work with. I highly recommend him!
