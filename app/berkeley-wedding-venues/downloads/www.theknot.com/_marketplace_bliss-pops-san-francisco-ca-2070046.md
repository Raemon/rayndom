I ordered Bliss Pops online and to my surprise received texts every step from order received, processing, and delivery. Mike delivered the pops exactly on time. We talked for a fe...

w minutes, I could tell that his passion is to make every customer happy. I can't imagine how difficult it is for him in this climate but brought the happy swag and aura in his delivery. The quality of the pops are top notch and service is impeccable. I would def order more pops in the near future. Thank you Mike.

I had my first experience with Bliss Popsicles back before the pandemic—Popsicles are my favorite dessert, and its a love shared with my family; there are three generations of us w...

ho adore popsicles (and have high standards because we’ve tasted so many). When I tasted these delicious treats, I couldn't get over how fantastic they were. We ordered a bunch to taste test for our wedding—forget cake! This was it. The consistency of texture in these pops is exactly right. So much flavor packed into each bite. Banana peach pecan fulfilled all my southern cravings, Birthday cake hit the spot in all the right ways, and Strawberry tasted fresh picked. A true delight for the tongue. Delivery was easy and convenient, and Mike was communicate and kind. Due to Covid, we ended up eloping, but are still planning to have a party to celebrate with family and friends at some point—I don’t know all the details yet, but I do know I want Bliss Pops to be a part of that special day.

y. It's an easy way to ensure everyone--flavor seekers, gluten-free, vegan, and everyone in between--can enjoy something. The sticks themselves make great party favors: folks can rinse them and then decorate with sharpies for some interactive fun.

, and brought enough pops to satisfy our 250 guests. Since the party was in a public space and we didn't want to feed random passersby, our guests were told to flash a secret signal to Mike (2 hands forming a heart) so he'd know who to feed. It all worked out perfectly. People loved it the pops, and everyone was well and happily fed. Highly recommend!

really special (and looked great in our photos) and they also offered custom stickers for the popsicle packaging and cart customization. The carts are really cute and lots of our guests wanted to take pictures with the carts. Their staff is friendly and very easy to work with. And of course, the pops are really delicious. One guest ate 5!
