Dreaming of saying "I do" with just the two of you on the beaches of Hawaii or atop a dome in Greece? It's easy to see why eloping is so appealing, especially when you have no or fewer guests to plan for. But how much does it cost to elope? Many see it as a more affordable option than a traditional wedding, but that really depends on whether you want a simple, bare minimum elopement or an elopement with all the bells and whistles in a romantic location. You can start customizing your elopement budget by learning about local wedding costs through [The Knot Budget Advisor](https://www.theknot.com/wedding-budget). Our guide on [how to elope](https://www.theknot.com/content/the-eloping-trend) will help you determine what vendors you'll need to budget for. We talked to a handful of them for all you need to know about elopement costs.

**In this article:**Does Eloping Cost Money? | How Much Does It Cost to Elope? | What is the Cost of Eloping vs. Wedding?





## Does Eloping Cost Money?

You might think that eloping will save you money, and you might be right! But just know that eloping isn't free—you still have to pay for the [marriage license cost](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-much-does-it-cost-to-get-married), which ranges anywhere from $20 to $110. But the cost to elope hinges on what you want. Prices will vary based on the location, but many couples choose to elope on an exotic trip or in a romantic destination, which Emily Coyne of [Emily Coyne Events](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/emily-coyne-events-napa-ca-1090044), based in Napa, California, says can run up your tab.

"While eloping can certainly save couples money, it isn't always the cost-saver it seems," she says. "Travel, photography, attire and site fees often bring expenses into the thousands."

To save money on eloping, wedding and elopement photographer [Kristy May](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/kristy-may-photography-morristown-nj-402453), based in Morristown, New Jersey, suggests planning early enough to lock in a lower rate or to avoid rush fees. There are plenty of places where you can elope without having to pay a ceremony site fee or only a small fee, she adds.

"If it's a destination elopement, definitely consider the time of year, as hotel costs and flights will vary substantially," May says. "I had a lovely wedding this past January on a weekday, and I'm sure that wedding would've cost double had it taken place in June."

## How Much Does It Cost to Elope?

So, how much does an elopement cost? First, ask yourself what kind of elopement you're dreaming of and whether it'll be in a high- or low-cost-of-living area. "An elopement at city hall will only cost a couple of hundred dollars, but when a couple desires a bespoke and elevated experience, eloping can easily range from $5,000 to $40,000 or more," Coyne says. "Even the smallest celebrations require thoughtful planning to ensure they feel seamless and authentic to the couple."

May says that between a photographer, officiant, flowers and beauty, the typical couple she photographs in the New York City area spends at least $5,000 to $10,000 on the cost of eloping. But, she adds, many spend more because they add on dinner or lunch with family or stay in nice hotels. "Of course, you can find a newer photographer and go to an NYC Marriage Bureau and spend well under $1,000," she notes.

### Find your kind of venue

From barns to ballrooms, discover reception venues that feel like you.

It's important to nail down your vision early on. Changing the scope of the elopement at the last minute can make things more expensive than originally planned, May says. "A lot of times people will go into the process, thinking they want to do something really simple, but then realize that this is their only wedding day and that they actually do want to have some of these more traditional elements of a wedding," she says. Here's how much you can expect to pay for some key elopement vendors—and don't forget to review our [elopement checklist](https://www.theknot.com/content/elopement-checklist) to make sure you're not leaving any details out of the budget!

### Cost of Elopement Photographer

As with any wedding photographer, the average cost of an elopement photographer can vary depending on how much experience they have and where you're getting married. The [average wedding photographer cost](https://www.theknot.com/content/average-cost-wedding-photographer) is $2,900, but according to photographer Julie Haider of [Julie Haider Elopements](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/julie-haider-%7C-elopement-photographer-albuquerque-nm-763446) based in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the average cost of elopement photography in the US ranges from $2,000 to $10,000.

How high in the range you'll pay will depend on how much time your photographer spends with you and how far they have to travel, she adds. "Many [elopement photographers](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/wedding-photographers), especially those who focus on adventure or destination elopements like myself, also include planning assistance or other helpful services in their photography packages," she says. "In that case, the total price is higher, but you gain a lot more than just photos."

### Cost of Elopement Planner

As with an elopement photographer, the cost of an elopement planner can run the gamut depending on their experience, location and what services are included in their [elopement package](https://www.theknot.com/content/elopement-packages). You can find many planners in the range of $1,000 to $5,000, but depending on what you want out of your planning experience, and if you're looking at a destination elopement, some might cost upwards of $10,000 or well beyond that.

### Cost of Elopement Wedding Venue

Prices for an elopement wedding venue can range from completely free to thousands of dollars—it makes a difference whether you're exchanging vows on a mountain top or in a castle. In more romantic destinations, venues or site fees can cost anywhere from $500 to $5,000, according to Coyne. But [courthouse wedding costs](https://www.theknot.com/content/courthouse-wedding-cost) can be as low as a couple of hundred dollars.

There are many factors that can either lower or jack up your elopement venue costs, such as what's included in the whole package. Is your meal included? Are accommodations included? Do you want decor included? Haider advises considering the following when budgeting for an elopement venue.

  * What day of the week you get married (many venues reserve Friday through Sunday for big weddings and won't allow elopements then)
  * How much access you have to the facilities and grounds
  * The level of privacy—if the venue closes to other visitors, you'll likely pay more than if the location remains open to the public
  * The season or time of year you elope
  * How many staff members you need to work with before and during your elopement
  * How much time is included in your reservation
  * Popularity of the location or venue

### Cost of Elopement Wedding Officiant

The [wedding officiant cost](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-officiant-fees-donations-basics) for an elopement isn't much different than a traditional wedding, and you can expect to pay more if you're getting married in a high-cost-of-living area or in a remote area they have to travel to. Haider says you can expect to pay between $200 and $1,200 for an officiant in the US on average. "If your officiant is offering a very customized ceremony experience or premarital counseling, you'll likely pay more than if they just show up and read from a basic script," she adds.

But if you're not interested in hiring someone to officiate, a friend or family member can become ordained online for free and lead the ceremony as well as legally sign your license. If you want a totally private vow reading, Haider suggests hiring an ordained photographer. First, make sure the area you're tying the knot in doesn't require a state-registered officiant to marry you.

[Find Elopement Officiants](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/wedding-officiants)

You can expect to shell out anywhere from $500 to $2,000 for the cost of elopement transportation, according to Coyne, which aligns with the average [wedding transportation cost](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-transportation-costs-tips-trends) of $1,075. If it's just the two of you eloping to city hall, all you might need to pay for is a taxi ride, or perhaps nothing at all if you're driving there. But if you're eloping in a more remote location, you might need to pay more to get yourselves and any vendors there. That might also be the case if you have a destination elopement with immediate family, unless you're all staying on-site. Regardless, some couples like to spend a little more in this area and splurge on a cool ride if they're saving money elsewhere. It all comes down to what you want on the wedding day!

[Find Wedding Transportation](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/transportation-services)

## What is the Cost of Eloping vs. Wedding?

According to [The Knot 2025 Real Weddings Study](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-data-insights/real-weddings-study), the average cost of a wedding ceremony and reception in 2024 was $33,000. That's a lot more than the $5,000 to $10,000 average cost of an elopement our experts estimated. "Elopements typically cost less than big weddings because you're eliminating the need for some items and services and significantly cutting down the quantity of others," explains Haider. For example, you don't need to hire a DJ or buy bridesmaid gifts. 

"You're also usually able to get a much more customized wedding day experience without a huge budget," she adds. "Basically, the same amount of money goes a lot farther for an elopement than for a large wedding. Instead of spending your food budget on a mediocre meal for 100 people, you can splurge on a private chef-made dinner for the two of you—an experience you'll never forget—for less."

But the idea that all elopements are less expensive than weddings isn't always true. As Haider points out, every couple has a different vision for their celebration. Just like the difference between a casual backyard wedding and a luxury event at a high-end hotel, there are varying budgets for different elopements.

If you wear clothes you already own, go to the courthouse, skip the photographer, and celebrate with a homemade meal, your elopement expenses can easily be under $100, Haider says. But if you decide to have custom-designed outfits, elope internationally with travel expenses, hire a high-quality photographer, include details like flowers and decor and celebrate at a luxurious resort, "your total bill will be in the tens of thousands."

As May puts it, "With an elopement, couples can spend on the parts of a wedding they care about most and not worry about pleasing guests or paying for things they don't care about. I think we should normalize the idea that elopements, like weddings, can be done on a budget or also be an occasion to splurge and have the day you want!"
