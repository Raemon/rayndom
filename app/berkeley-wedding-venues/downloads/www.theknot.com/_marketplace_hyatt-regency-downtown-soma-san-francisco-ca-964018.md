Fantastic hotel in San Francisco, one of the best we've stayed at in California! Clean, spacious, and modern rooms—the ones with views of San Francisco’s skyscrapers are amazing! The staff is always friendly and helpful. Position great! The o...

nly thing I’d recommend is not to use their parking, as it’s very expensive. There are cheaper options nearby. 😊

Clean rooms, comfy, great views. Nice Club but boring snack options. Breakfast was great. Vallet parking only. Nice localization. Great design of hotel. I wish hotel would be more kid friendly and be prepared for small kids and have some stools...

ready in bathrooms.

The room was a bit small, but it had everything we needed. The quality of the Hyatt brand is always reliable. We booked quite early, so the price turned out to be surprisingly affordable, even cheaper than most Airbnbs in downtown San Francisco...

, which was fantastic. 😂 The location was great, with plenty of options for buses, grocery shopping, and dining nearby. It’s one of the safe and convenient places to stay within the city. * The downside is that if you’re driving, valet parking is mandatory, and the price is shockingly high (definitely not recommended)😱

Excellent Location & Facilities, but Miserable Stay Due to Broken Heater and not good service to resolve. The physical hotel and location are absolutely fantastic (5/5). It’s perfect for San Francisco conferences, the facilities are great, and...

the most staff were very friendly. However, my stay was completely ruined by a major maintenance failure and unacceptable service recovery. The heating in the room was broken; the room was so cold and the unit was blowing air that was not even lukewarm. I ended up catching a cold. When maintenance came, it was ignored the fact the room was cold, focusing only on a vent temperature of 90F and acting like we were asking for excessive heat like summer. The temporary solution—a small heater—was too loud to run overnight. For a 4-star hotel in this prime business location, this lack of effective troubleshooting is completely shocking. I would want to return for the location and rooms, but I cannot recommend staying here given the risk of a broken amenity and the dismal response from the troubleshooting team. Serious management attention is needed here.
