perience amazing! Planning a destination wedding isn't always the easiest to do, but knowing I had Sharon helping me every step of the way, made it a stress free process. She holds herself/team and her vendors to such a high standards, and it shows. She only accepts a certain amount of weddings a year so book her quickly, she is a thousand percent worth every penny. I have made a lifetime friend and will never forget how hard she worked to help make my wedding everything I ever wanted it to be. Don't hesitate to call, booking her will be one of the best decisions you will make!

as able to take our initial conversation and able to make fantastic vender recommendations. She has been in the business for a while and you could see the great relationships she had with everyone we met. Being from out of town and having very busy schedules she was always able to help us with phone calls and emails. When we were in town she made sure we were priority number 1 and you could always tell she always had our best interests in mind.

My husband and I had our wedding at a family vineyard in Napa and Sharon not only coordinated the whole thing, she knocked it completely out of the park. This was a destination wed...

ding for not only ourselves, but all of our 125 guests. We are so thankful to have had her throughout the entire process. It was way better than any wedding I had imagined. I flew up to Napa twice and felt that I could have even just gone once. She knew the ropes so well that she suggested and handled aspects that I never even thought about, but were important. Another HUGE part to it was that the vineyard was under construction the entirety of the planning process. She developed a great relationship with the contractors, estate owner, and winemaker to ensure that everything would be ready for the wedding day. She also completely designed the ceremony, cocktail hour, and receptions sites to my taste and they turned out GORGEOUS. It was all transformed in a day and then back to normal the day after with no input from myself or my family. Her vendors are absolutely top notch. She has amazing relationships and partnerships with everyone we used and was completely open if I wanted to bring in someone different. She coordinated everything between all of them and they did an outstanding job. My husband and I were told countless times over by our guests that it was the best wedding they had ever been to. It all just came together so perfectly and I have Sharon to thank for that. It was an absolute pleasure working with her the entire way through, from almost a year out, to the day of. She was easily accessible, and could always give me an honest opinion. I relied on her knowledge, expertise, and opinions on pretty much everything. I never could have done this wedding for a second without her. I am so glad that I can look on my wedding day and engagement as a lovely, stress-free, and exciting time. Thank you, Sharon, from the bottom of our hearts for the wedding of our dreams.

Sharon Burns was extremely helpful with planning our daughter's destination wedding in Sonoma Valley, California. She truly went above and beyond to help our daughter realize the w...

edding of her dreams. Making the planning fun and handling so many of the important details helped reduce the stress considerably. Her accommodating, positive attitude meant a great deal to us. When my daughter and I visited the area one year before the wedding, we knew we were in good hands when Sharon patiently spent two full days with us, showing us numerous venues for the ceremony, reception, and rehearsal dinner. She was thorough with wedding details and extremely knowledgeable regarding area vendors, which is crucial. Her assistant, Jessica, was also very helpful - they made an excellent team the day of the wedding. Here's Sharon in a nutshell: the sole of my husband's shoe separated from the top of the shoe 30 minutes prior to the wedding ceremony. He found Sharon and said, "Sharon, we have an emergency." And she replied, "I love emergencies!" The problem was quickly rectified :) There's no need to look elsewhere; you will not be disappointed with Sharon. We felt blessed to have found her!

I cannot say enough wonderful things about Sharon. She provided guidance from beginning to end and even though during the planning phase she ran into some serious personal issues ...

and performed a personal move you wouldn't know it by the level of care and detail she paid to our wedding. She provided amazing references for all the vendors which is so helpful when planning a destination wedding – as I live in North Carolina. Also, Sharon really worked with me on the budget and was on my team when dealing with the vendors and pricing which I really appreciated! For instance, she helped reduce our floral estimate to be more in-line with our initial budget by working directly with our vendor. The day-of was seamless because Sharon and her assistant Jessica were right by my side the entire day making sure everything went as planned. If you’re looking for a very detailed, organized coordinator that is also just a kind, sweet and fun to be around person – than I would highly recommend using Napa Valley Custom Events for your next event!
