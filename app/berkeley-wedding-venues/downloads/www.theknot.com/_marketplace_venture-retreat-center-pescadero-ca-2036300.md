We hosted our wedding over 2 nights - festival style, here in October 2024, and had a wonderful experience from start to end. Firstly, the venue is stunning, you're really surrou...

nded by wild beautiful nature. There's also so many facilities to make it a fun camp out experience - glamping tents, pool, hot tub, bbq set up, fire pit, games... Secondly, the whole team at VRC are superb - always so accommodative, on top of things, helpful and sweet. Special shoutout to Janelle and Kate who made the planning process so much easier on us. If you're planning an event, wanting to be fully immersed in nature, with more free flow and less structure, we highly recommend VRC (:

My daughter married her high school sweetheart at Venture during the last week of December. Kate and Janelle and the rest of the staff were amazing to work with from the start. T...

hey answered many, many questions and helped us work through several issues that might arise with a rustic setting for a larger wedding (188 total). They really encouraged retreat wedding weekend, which involved the wedding party staying overnight the day before and night of wedding. We are so glad we had this option as it provided more restful and less hectic time together. The setting is beautiful, we didn’t need a whole lot of extras because nature provided natural decor, and that’s what my daughter wanted to highlight. We also appreciated being able to pick our own caterers and tailor alcohol service to our preferences instead of having to pay a per person alcohol fee. There are so many little extras, like the bridesmaids being able to get ready together in the big, beautiful yurt and me ((mom of bride) getting to stay in a comfy little RV. It is a rustic setting—restrooms are cute little outhouses. The bridal party cooked breakfast together in the fully stocked and covered outdoor kitchen. Rehearsal dinner was prepared onsite on their propane operated Weber grills. There is a beautiful lodge that is under reconstruction. We were able to use the modern restroom and two of the finished rooms. There is some more I could write! My daughter’s wedding was a success. The setting was so beautiful. She loved having a Venture Wedding Retreat, and we loved seeing her and our son-in-law so happy on their wedding day.

Venture Retreat Center was such a beautiful location for our wedding, it was just as I pictured it, a magical, whimsical, forest wedding. (We didn't go full on with any theme, but ...

my mood board pictures all hewed in the if we were getting married in the Lord of the Rings' elves' forest direction). Being able to stay on site and have some of our guests (mostly those in our wedding party) stay on site was so relaxing, although sadly it was too cold (mid September) to use the pool! We had our rehearsal dinner there the night before (pizza from Verrazzano Pizza in Half Moon Bay), got ready there in the morning (I bought a large portable battery for the hair curlers, etc, and my bridesmaids and mom and I got our hair and makeup done on the deck behind the honeymoon tent which was so perfect and relaxing, while the guys got ready in one of the giant tent/yurts on the other side of the property), and then of course had our ceremony and dinner and dancing there that evening. A few of our guests even described our wedding as magical afterwards which made me feel like I'd really achieved my goal, lol. This venue is definitely the kind where you need to be in a do it yourself mindset - I had originally wanted a more all-inclusive wedding venue so that there would be less for me to have to choose and I didn't have to plan every little detail, but of all the foresty locations I looked at, this one just had the right relaxing feels to me. It didn't feel over the top, it felt very customizable, and most importantly whenever I came to visit there I just felt relaxed and that's how I wanted to feel for the wedding weekend. To balance out the do it yourself-ness, I did end up hiring a wedding planner for the whole process instead of just day of coordination, and I think that helped with not being overwhelmed and having the day go off so well. (For reference wedding was 9/14/24) In addition to the feeling at the venue being so relaxing, a few other things that drew us to this venue: \- Its a small, family owned business. I was really trying to make as many sustainable/ethical decisions as I could when planning the wedding, and figured, if I was going to be spending this much money, I wanted to support small businesses instead of the big corporate wedding institutions. Not being at a big corporate setup, you do trade some of the we've-done-this-hundreds-of-times-before knowledge and polish, but in it's place you get flexibility, customization, and the feeling like your wedding can be unique and not exactly the same as the hundreds that have come before (which I'm not looking down on, because there are so many decisions to make when planning a wedding, it can be really nice to have some of those taken away and at first that's what I wanted, but I don't regret ultimately going the other direction). \- The decor and lawn games they offer and having guests staying on site, etc was all included in their fee. One thing that really annoyed me looking at other venues was feeling nickle-and-dimed. Like I'm paying you this huge amount of money, and you're going to ask for another $50 dollars so I can offer my guests cornhole during the happy hour? Really?? The fact that Venture didn't do that was a huge plus in their column for me, even just in the feels I had toward the place, if that makes sense. \- They kept improving the place after we had booked - for example the deck where I got ready wasn’t there the first time we visited!

VRC helped accommodate us and our entire family when our original reception venue cancelled due to wildfires (we were married in September 2020)! We ended up doing an informal wedd...

ing ceremony and reception here. They were super flexible and obliging even though our very large group scheduled with them very last minute. We used all of the grounds (stayed the night before our wedding and the night after) and it was so beautiful! The venue is surrounded by nature - some woods and very close to the beach - but still had the comforts of a very spacious kitchen/dining, bathrooms, etc. The only issue we ran into was that there was no cell service - but we wanted an unplugged ceremony anyway. :)
