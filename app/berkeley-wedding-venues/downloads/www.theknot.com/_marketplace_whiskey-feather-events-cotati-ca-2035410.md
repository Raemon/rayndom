istently went above and beyond for us, and her guidance throughout the process was invaluable. Every vendor she recommended — hair and makeup, rentals, DJ — was exceptional, and everything came together more beautifully than we could have imagined. Jenny was always on top of everything, which allowed us to truly enjoy our day without worrying about a single detail. Her husband Chris was also fantastic and such a wonderful support on our rehearsal and wedding day. Together they made the entire experience unforgettable. We are so grateful to Jenny and could not recommend her more highly.

We truly cannot imagine planning our wedding without Jenny. Our celebration was a relatively complex, multi-day wedding at a camp in Northern California, with a wide range of logi...

stics, vendor coordination, and very specific food restrictions and guest needs. From the very beginning, she brought clarity, calm, and structure to what could have easily felt overwhelming. She was exceptional at keeping us on track with the countless important details and deadlines, including many things we absolutely would have forgotten without her guidance. Her experience showed at every step. She made it incredibly easy to identify, connect with, and coordinate outstanding vendors across the board, from photography and lighting to tables, florals, and DJs. Every recommendation was thoughtful, professional, and a great fit for what we were trying to create. Beyond the logistics, she was simply wonderful to work with. She was organized, responsive, and genuinely invested in making sure we felt happy, confident, and supported throughout the process. On the wedding weekend itself, everything ran smoothly, and we were able to be fully present and enjoy the celebration, knowing she had everything handled.

edding day itself, Jenny and her team exceeded every expectation. In the month leading up, Jenny went above and beyond with her time, keeping us calm, confident, and totally on track. Her checklists and weekly check-ins were absolute lifesavers. I should mention that Jenny hadn’t planned a wedding at our venue before but you would have never known. Everything was perfect—and I mean truly perfect. Not a single thing went wrong, which I know is rare in the world of weddings. That’s a true testament to Jenny and her team’s dedication, hard work, and heart. On top of it all, Jenny is such a joy to work with! She made the process feel like planning with a friend—fun, supportive, and exactly the energy you want as the wedding gets closer. We are forever grateful and cannot recommend Whiskey Feather Events enough!

My wife and I are both very creative people. We had ambitious plans for our wedding day, but we felt confident that we’d pull it off. It wasn’t until Whiskey Feather Events came in...

to the picture, that we realized we still had a lot to learn. We booked Jenny and WFE on a six-week wedding planning package because it was a requirement from our venue. We figured that our wedding planner would just handle some communications and make sure everything went into place on our special day. It wasn’t until our first call with Jenny that we realized we had fallen behind in our planning. Luckily, Jenny came to our rescue and put us on a fast track to making our day a dream come true. She took an event that was behind schedule and turned it into a showstopper, and more importantly, a memory that our family will cherish forever. In the run up to the wedding, WFE helped with big picture stuff like timeline planning and vendor communications, but Jenny also got deep into the weeds by sourcing furniture, finding floral containers, and rearranging floor plans. We were already blown away by Jenny’s service, as she gave us so much confidence when we had doubts. On wedding day, though, she kicked it up a notch. Our event was so complex, that Jenny recruited extra hands to make sure everything went according to our plan. A special shoutout to Jenny’s husband, Chris, who went the extra mile to help my sister MacGyver a security tag that had been left on her dress. I truly don’t know where our event would have ended up without Jenny and WFE. We wholeheartedly recommend their service!

ices 60 days before our wedding in Sonoma, and she was everything we needed and more. In the final stretch, when things could have felt overwhelming, she brought a calm, organized, and deeply thoughtful presence that gave us total peace of mind. She’s incredibly responsive, knowledgeable, and on top of every little detail (including ones we hadn’t even considered). From building a timeline to help us create the flow of the day, reviewing contracts, coordinating with vendors, and making sure our decor was exactly where we envisioned it, Jenny nailed everything, and we felt 100% supported every step of the way. Her team on the day was amazing too! Everything ran so smoothly, and we truly didn’t have to worry about a thing. Our wedding day was beautiful and completely stress-free, with Jenny and her team behind the scenes making it all happen. We are endlessly grateful!

Jenny and her husband Chris were fabulous to work with! We decided to move forward with the month-of package, however, Jenny was in regular contact in the months before the wedding...

to make sure she had all the vendor information she needed to ensure a smooth transition for the month-of. We met weekly during the month leading up to our wedding, reviewing decor strike lists, rental orders, catering quantities, and addressing any concerns / hiccups that arose. The only factor completely out of our control was the weather, and as we had an outdoor venue booked for mid-October the likeliness for rain was possible but SO extremely low. Well... it happened. It rained the entire day, although it was a light mist, the dripping from the redwood trees above never let up. Jenny was truly our rock on the day of our wedding. She did everything in her power to make sure vendors were set up as best as possible, guest's seats were wiped immediately prior to seating, and she was able to pivot our entire dining experience from our intended plated dinner to more of a mix and mingle style service. It all worked out, guests raved about the wedding and Travis and I were encouraged and supported by both Jenny and her husband Chris throughout the entire day. We had a moment together prior to the ceremony where I was starting to panic, the rain was not letting up as forecasted and Jenny gave us a much needed pep talk: this was our wedding, this was our story and we are going to embrace the day! We did just that and it was incredible! I am so grateful that we booked Jenny and for her support the day-of and the month leading up. She is extremely organized, thorough, and her years of experience in event planning / management are evident in her work ethic and how smoothly the day went despite the rain. Thank you, Jenny & Chris! :)

no way I could have had such a successful wedding day and weekend without Jenny and Whiskey Feather Events! As someone not in the area, if I ever needed a recommendation for a vendor, Jenny had at least five! If I needed another view or picture of the venue, Jenny was willing to drive to the venue to do another quick site walk through! If I felt like I was missing something or didn’t think of something, Jenny would go through an endless checklist with me, give suggestions as needed, and reassure me that I had thought of everything and was well prepared! On the actual day, all of our vendors were extremely prepared and knew to go to Jenny and Chris for anything. Jenny and Chris ran everything so smoothly and ahead of schedule for the day which allowed my husband and I to enjoy the day, focus on each other and our guests, and never allowed us to worry about anything during our pre-wedding and wedding events. I cannot recommend Whiskey Feather Events enough! There are not enough words to describe how wonderful Jenny and her assistant Chris are leading up to the day and on the actual day itself!

After interviewing a number of day-of coordinators, one of the easiest (and best) decisions for our wedding was working with Whiskey Feather Events. Jenny (and her talented assista...

nt/husband/Swiss army knife, Chris) made our wedding day possible. From the initial phone call, to multiple site visits, to managing our vendors, Jenny was the consummate professional. Having worked on all sides of the hospitality business (hotel/site management, restaurant/catering, event planning), she understands the pain points for each vendor type, and the importance of a detailed vendor contract. This came in very handy when our caterer decided to forget months of discussions and planning, going rogue the day of our wedding. The Whiskey Feather team handled it perfectly behind the scenes with the result that you hope for - none of our guests noticed a thing. Furthermore, Jenny knew how to manage family and guests, answering a million questions, all while overseeing our very bespoke wedding at a private home in the Napa Valley. I would not hesitate to recommend Whiskey Feather to anyone who needs a wedding planner or day-of coordinator.

If you are thinking about working with Jenny, this is your sign from the universe to do it. Words can’t even describe how magical our wedding day was! Working with Jenny was the ...

best choice. I am so thankful I found her. From our first call, her attention to detail was clear, I knew she was the one lol. Planning a destination wedding in Sonoma was exactly what we wanted. We live in Minneapolis, and we knew it would be stressful, since most decisions would have to be online. She made things easy because she was my guide and would even FaceTime me from the venue and multiple walk throughs. Jenny took over 90 days prior to the wedding and had our weekly zoom calls. Her check lists, communication and attention to detail were what made this process easy. She was good at following up and checking things off in a timely manner. My mom tried to be involved and she kept asking who is doing this and that and I would say Jenny, she didn’t get it. How can I trust someone so much. I just did. I felt good about everything. My mom requested the day of the wedding to walk around and check to make sure things were in order, but she was so pleased and happy with how amazing everything was already! she didn’t even do her “walk through”. She loved her! Jenny and her team made our wedding day a truly beautiful dream. Seeing everything come together, the decorations, candles, little details that you can’t do yourself, yet you show up and it’s perfectly how you had envisioned it. All thanks to her. As you can read, I didn’t mention anything about vendors, well we had multiple vendors, but they weren’t even on my mind because Jenny took care of them. She helped us fully enjoy the day, be present and celebrate our love. We highly recommend her to help you with your special day.

Our experience working with Jenny from Whiskey Feather Events was seamless and perfect from our first phone call to our wedding day. From the first call with Jenny, it was just an ...

instant click and connection between us. Jenny is quick to answer any questions during the planning process and is detail-oriented – dotting every “I” and crossing every “T”. Not only did my husband and I feel prepared for the details of our BIG day; but our vendors were extremely prepared for our wedding day as well and everything ran so smoothly and ahead of schedule for the day. All this preparation allowed my husband and I the ability to enjoy the day, focus on each other, and release us from any worry little or big during our wedding ceremony and reception. In addition to all this Jenny and her assistant – Chris, were so pleasant and positive to work with, which made the whole process even easier! I would absolutely recommend Whiskey Feather Events to coordinate your wedding celebration!! Jenny is a gem!!

onal , top tier! Jenny did amazing coordinating with every vendor and getting everything in line for the big day. At the wedding even with hiccups and problems that would make most brides panic I knew nothing about it because Jenny took action before anyone knew and got anything figured out before it interfered with the wedding timeline. She is the perfect mixture of “strictly business” with a mix of someone you feel like you’ve known forever because her heart is so big. In moments where I needed advice , Jenny was the one I leaned on. I could go on and on about her but if you are looking for someone who will make your day flow with grace, someone who will be the enforcer when you don’t want to be, but someone who is just down to earth… whiskey feather events is it. Forever thankful I found them and will forever consider them family after everything. Also if yours dog mama and want to make a million details about your fur baby I promise you, she’ll be all in!

r. 5 months before the big day we realized we were in over our heads. Enter: Whiskey Feather Events! Jenny stepped up without hesitation, demonstrating immense professionalism and dedication. Despite the time crunch, she effortlessly managed every detail, ensuring the event went off without a hitch. Her attention to the small details was impeccable; from the placement of the flowers to the timing of the speeches, everything was executed flawlessly, making our special day truly unforgettable. What stood out most was her kindness and flexibility throughout the entire process. She understood the stress we were under with the last-minute changes and went above and beyond to accommodate our needs. Her calm demeanor and reassuring presence eased our worries, allowing us to relax and fully enjoy the celebration. Her adaptability was remarkable, seamlessly adjusting to any unexpected changes and ensuring that everything ran smoothly, making the day feel effortless and magical. In summary, our Jenny was an absolute gem.

Jenny was a dream come true for our wedding planning! We began our planning on our own 8 months before the wedding date. It was in Cali and we live in Texas. Needless to say after ...

3-4 months we needed professional help! Jenny was so helpful and informative in the beginning with ideas and references on different vendors for us to seek out. We hired her as a partial planner and when she stepped in she was great. She communicated so well with us every step of the way. And she took the lead after about three months before, and that took alot of the stress off of us! As the wedding approached she took over 100% and we were impressed on how she handled everything going forward. Her ideas were well needed and appreciated. The logistics of a wedding with most guests out of state required a lot of attention on Jenny’s part for things like logistics, hotels, transportation and lots more. The days before the wedding were very crucial to get all the timing down, and it had a lot of parts to it. Jenny handled it all. On the day of she communicated well to all vendors and us as well and our needs throughout the day. I have nothing but good things to say about Jenny, if you want a dream come true wedding, Jenny is the wedding planner for you!

t decision of our entire planning process- we hired Whiskey Feather Events. We chose the ‘wedding management’ package and it greatly exceeded our expectations. Jenny’s enthusiasm and competence were immediately evident. She took over communication with all of our vendors, helped us with budgeting, and thoughtfully finalized every aspect of the day down to the smallest details. She has a creative and artistic eye and even designed and hand-crafted lovely signage and table numbers for us. While Jenny was kind and professional throughout the whole process, she was also assertive and not afraid to speak up and advocate for us when confronted with a few prickly and disorganized vendors. Jenny and her team made sure our wedding day was executed flawlessly so we could relax and really enjoy it. She handled unexpected events (including unplanned speeches, a dog loose on the premises, and wedding crashers) swiftly and with grace. We cannot recommend Whiskey Feather Events’ services highly enough.

nning Spring wedding held at a historical estate and gardens. She took my vision and turned it into what our guests said was “the best wedding we’ve ever been to, including our own!” Jenny arranged a tour of the venue and met with the director several times. She had floor plans and seating recommendations far in advance. Jenny had clever ideas that made the garden wedding beautiful, a floral arch, bamboo seating, and a brass quartet for wedding music. She found the ideal vendors, reviewed proposals, and coordinated everyone’s activities, including our large wedding party. Jenny worked with the caterer to accommodate our vegan and gluten-free guests, and it was executed beautifully. Of course, Jenny was indispensable on the day of the wedding. She was the key person in charge of the schedule, organizing the band sets with the caterer and photographer. She kept the flow lively and fun. The smartest decision we made was to ask Jenny to take over. It was a spectacular event and Jenny deserves all the credit.

ll organized, personable and calm. She created a detailed schedule for the day and worked with our vendors to ensure everyone was aligned and had enough time. She even gave a shorter schedule for our family/wedding party so everyone knew what to expect and more importantly, where to be. Our weekly calls with her were a lot of fun! We always left feeling like we had everything under control and we knew what we needed to work on over the next week. She made sure no detail was missed. We had already planned many details with the caterer and other vendors, but she found items that we had forgotten to request and plan for, such additional linens & tables for other planned displays. On the day of, she was the point person for everything, and allowed us to relax and enjoy our special day with each other, friends, and family and not need to worry about anything with the event. Jenny and the Whiskey Feather team are incredible!!

Our check-in calls were not only extremely helpful, but they were actually fun! When the big day came, Jenny and her wonderful husband continued to be rockstars - they even went to Walgreens to get earplugs for one of the guests! I cannot recommend Whiskey Feather Events more.

She had some great local candy shop recommendations for our favors and organized/ordered the favors for us. It was so nice to have someone take something of the list and run with it! She was so wonderful at helping us pull together all of the last minute details. Jenny really went above and beyond in everything that she did to make our wedding day so special. She even offered to drive around town to help us select a great location for our wedding party photos about a week before the wedding! Jenny seamlessly made sure that all of the events happened on time throughout the day, setup all of our decorations at the reception, and took them all up to our room at the end of the night so that we didn’t have to worry about cleaning up anything! We also loved working with Jenny because she has such a great personality and knows how to be one step ahead of any issue that might arise before it happens.

tponed to May 2021 due to COVID. About 12 weeks before our wedding we realized that we may not be able to have the wedding of our dreams at our original venue given the unpredictability of the regulations. We started thinking about having our reception in my grandmother's backyard and knew that we would need the help of a wedding planner to coordinate all the different vendors we would need. We reached out to Jenny, and from the start she was extremely professional and put my mind at ease. We had just under 12 weeks to coordinate a floor plan, tent and rental company, bathrooms, catering, changes in flowers, bar service, transportation logistics (there were a lot as there was no parking at my grandmother's), water and power logistics, changes needed to accommodate our band and create a very detailed timeline for the weekend. Jenny also took over communication with vendors that we had previously booked. I cannot imagine how we would have pulled this off without her. Throughout the entire process she was calm and patient with any requests we came to her with and her positive attitude kept my anxiety at bay. When we decided to host our wedding reception in my grandmother's backyard, we accepted that things may not be perfect. However, this could not have been further from the truth. The day was absolutely beautiful and we as well as all of our guests were blown away by how beautiful everything looked and how much fun the wedding was. Her presence during the set up and day off also provided a sense that everything would be taken care of. I whole-heartedly recommend working with Whiskey Feather Events-- Jenny will help bring your ideas to life to create the event of your dreams.
