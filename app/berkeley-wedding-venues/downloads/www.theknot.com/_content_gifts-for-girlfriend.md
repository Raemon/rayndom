## How to Choose the Perfect Gift for Your Girlfriend

We understand shopping for your girlfriend is a tricky task, especially if you're looking for a [gift for a new relationship](https://www.theknot.com/content/gifts-for-new-relationship). Our advice? Start by considering her interests and hobbies. For instance, a custom embosser is a good gift for a reader and a monogrammed makeup bag is clever for an aspiring beauty influencer. Next, look back on your relationship, especially if you're looking for an anniversary gift for your girlfriend. If you first bonded over your love of music, a mixed tape with your shared favorite songs will be a sweet tribute to your love story. And if you're really stumped, choose an [experience gift](https://www.theknot.com/content/gift-experiences-for-couples) so you can spend more quality time together.
