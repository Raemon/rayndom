This private club had everything I was looking for in a wedding venue. The property allows for such a seamless event. They have a gorgeous terrace where I had my outdoor ceremony. ...

The lake and Mt. Diablo hills (although brown in the summer!) creates such a picturesque backdrop. Then it's off to cocktail hour in the bar area of the Lakehouse Ballroom right next door. It's spacious and also has a balcony for guests to enjoy the view. The ballroom for dinner was also the perfect size for my 200 guest wedding. The food was amazing! The portions were BIG and cooked to perfection. Service was attentive and so well mannered. I loved working with the on-site banquet coordinator Shannon. She was responsive to e-mails and helped organize everything from the initial site visit, food tasting, event order, rehearsal and main event. It was a pleasure working with her throughout the planning process. And as luxe and exclusive as the venue feels, I was relieved they didn't try to nickel and dime me for every little expense. It definitely wasn't a bargain-priced venue but it was worth every penny to us!
