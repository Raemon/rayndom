y with such joy. We were thrilled with how all our photos turned out - they were absolutely gorgeous! She was incredibly organized, responsive, and detail-oriented. She was so easy to communicate with, and gave us suggestions on how to pose (which was so appreciated), while listening to any preferences we might have. Our planning meetings were so helpful, and on our wedding day, she managed a large wedding party and really kept us on track with our timeline, making sure we captured every photo we wanted. She delivered our photos to us quickly. We are so grateful to her for so beautifully capturing all the special moments of our big day. Our families and friends too absolutely loved her photos. Working with her was easily one of the best parts of the wedding planning process. We would not hesitate to work with her again in the future!

She was relaxed, professional, and so easy to work with, capturing very special candid moments, little details, and couple/ family shots. Sarah did all the photo editing- the final gallery turned out perfectly and more than we could have expected- it truly felt like 'us'! The entire process was easy from start to finish, including the online gallery where we could easily download, share and order prints from. We’re so grateful to Sarah and Sara for capturing our day so beautifully. Highly, highly recommend this team!

From the first call Sarah walked us through the whole day, helping us pick the right package for our event, and made sure she had a clear vision of what we wanted and created a timeline with us so that we would know how the day would work leaving no question unanswered! She even kept our 18 month old flower girls attention in all of our pictures while being 8 months pregnant herself on our wedding day! You would never have known except for her belly because she gave us her undivided attention and energy through the whole event even until all of the guest were on the dance floor at the end of the night!

TLDR: Sarah Fischback photography was perfect for our wedding! She worked with us every step of the way, had contingency plans and made our wedding day perfect. Why/what we chose:...

We booked her about a year out from our wedding in May 2024. We wanted someone who was local, with a great portfolio, and wasn’t a chain with multiple sites and a huge staff. She was flexible with the contract as we decided what we did and didn’t want. We decided on 1 photographer for 8 hours, 1 photographer for 6 hours & 1 videographer for 6 hours with an 8-10 min video of the day, plus a hard drive of pictures & footage. Leading up: We made payments in 3 installments over that year. We filled out a form which laid out specific shots we wanted, timeline for the day, and choose music for the video. 1 month before the wedding we had a phone call with Sarah directly to discuss all the plans. She answered every question we had and took great notes on a spreadsheet that she shared with us. She also told us that she was pregnant and would be due sometime soon after our wedding so she was planning to have the second photographer stay longer to help out in case she couldn’t do certain things, at no charge to us. The only “problem”: A week before the wedding Sarah texted us that she had gone into labor. This could easily have been one of those stressful last minute wedding issues, but she had an organized, thorough, and thoughtful contingency plan. She had her secondary photographer become the primary, and had another individual as her secondary. She filled them in on the plans of the day and everything was still a go! And Sarah still edited our photos. It was a bummer we wouldn’t have Sarah there, but given how everything had gone so far we trusted her and hoped for the best! Wedding day: The bridal party was met by Sara Fischer (our new primary) at a nearby hotel right on time for all the getting ready shots! Sean (secondary) arrived with Jose (videographer). They started with shots of the venue and groomsmen getting ready. The ceremony started and they just sort of blended in with the crowd, it was great! We didn’t have a wedding planner for making sure we were on time, but the photographers helped with this (not their job but super helpful). The reception went really well too! They worked hard and I hope I gave them a break to have some food as the day really got away from me! Another great thing is Sean got some photos with my film camera. Sara, Sean, and Jose were absolutely delightful people to have at the wedding and seemed truly happy to be there. Photo reveal: 2 weeks after the ceremony we got 8 sneak peaks and gave some feedback on coloring and lighting preferences! 8 weeks after the ceremony we got our photos! I honestly love every single photo they took! Absolutely no duds! Our video was 9 minutes long and beautiful! It is amazing to see all these shots of us and our guests, especially from times I didn’t even notice the cameras. Final thoughts: I cannot recommend Sarah Fischback enough. She did so much for us and made our day very special. I know the photographer is one of the most expensive parts of the wedding, but Sarah far exceeded my expectations and it was well worth it!

urned out amazing. We were first drawn to Sarah's photography style - the photos are bright and natural-looking. We really wanted to do our engagement photos at SF City Hall. Sarah knows all of the good spots and how to catch the light. We were also complete newbies (and awkward), and Sarah taught us how to pose and look natural. She turned around the engagement photos super quickly, even sending a few sneak peaks right away while she worked on editing the photos. On the wedding day, Sarah and her second photographer showed up early to the venue and had warm energy that helped reduce the stress of the day. Handling many combinations of family members for photos and getting a toddler to smile at the right time is no easy task and Sarah handled everything perfectly - she is so good with kids! We have so many wonderful photos (candid and posed) from our wedding day and are so happy we made the right choice with Sarah!

Can't thank Sarah enough for taking photos of our wedding and tea ceremony! She was very professional and detail oriented. Before the wedding week, we went through the wedding time...

line and she asked us for a list of people we wanted to make sure to got photos with as well as poses/specific shots. We had multiple hiccups during the wedding, including a serious car crash involving the wedding party and running behind schedule during the reception. Sarah worked around all of that to help make sure that we got a photo with everyone in the wedding party and the coordinating with our reception MCs to make sure that we got our sunset photos in between our reception programming. The photos turned out beautifully and we got many compliments from it. We really liked how we got several different versions of key moments, eg first kiss with and without the pastor. Her photo editing skills are fantastic.

ake the experience as painless as possible while giving us breathtaking results! The engagement photos were so much fun to take, and we are so happy with how they came out. As for our wedding photos / Video, we couldn't be happier. Every photo has such amazing quality and she really got all the pictures you could want and more. We even added in a video last minute, and were stunned at the final result. Something we will love to share for the years to come.

We loved Sarah’s work, and were thrilled to work with her. Wedding planning is stressful and Sarah made the photography portion of the planning the least difficult to map out. On...

our wedding day, were blown away by her talent, patience, attention to detail, and professionalism. She blended right in with our chaotic group of loved ones, making each person feel comfortable, forgetting that there was a photographer present. The pictures of our wedding are absolutely beautiful, and we could not be happier with the photos immortalizing our special day. We highly recommend Sarah, her work speaks for itself!

I couldn’t have asked for a better wedding photographer. Sarah initiated prep calls with me prior to our wedding, listened closely to what I was looking for in terms of our wedding...

photos and was very responsive throughout the planning. What I loved most about Sarah though was that she sought to understand what I expected from her. During our engagement session, she specifically asked if we’re the type of couple who knows what we’re doing or if we need more specific guidance and that really set the stage for how much we needed her to lean in during the photo shoot. By the day of our wedding, I felt that I could trust fully that she’d execute on everything I wanted and she sure did with the photos she took for us! So glad to have had Sarah as our wedding photographer!

It’s been 5 months since our November wedding and my husband and I can’t stop smiling and tearing up at how beautiful our wedding pictures are. Sarah captured all of our special de...

tails and special moments the entire day and we can’t thank her enough at how professional and comfortable she made us feel. She was extremely professional and sweet, always knew what to do and had the perfect poses for us, which was great because it did not make anything awkward and instead made things go smoothly and faster. I am a very detailed person and I think I was the biggest bridezilla but Sarah never missed a single moment to capture all the best parts. My favorite part was so naturally catching her going above and beyond on my requests which made for every shot to be extra special. And now, we have over a thousand perfect photos to choose from and cherish forever with our loved ones of our most special day. Thank you Sarah! And can’t wait to work with you all over again on any future milestones!

iments on them and these pics are timeless. She knows city hall very well and gave us a lot of fun poses to do. On top of that, she is easy to work worth, professional, and went the extra mile to coordinate our first look/manage our parents/manage strangers getting in the way of our pics. We had a lot of fun and would HIGHLY RECOMMEND Sarah for anh photo shoot!

Sarah was probably my favorite wedding vendor that we hired! Not only are her photos beautiful, but she almost felt like a day-of coordinator because she was politely directing us ...

and our guests where to go and what to do for the best photos. She arrived on time, communicated clearly, and is just a really kind person in general. The turn around time on the photos was quick and we are happy with the results. Wedding guests were really impressed with her too and a few reached out after the wedding to compliment her presence. I’d definitely hire Sarah again for future photography needs!

When I started wedding planning everyone told me that the most important thing is who you have around you that day. We can genuinely say that Sarah made our wedding day incredible....

She is so much more than an amazing photographer, she is the sweetest and most supportive person you could have documenting that special day. She wasn’t just a photographer, she was a genuinely great person that cares about her couples and does far more than her “job”. Sarah delivered the most beautiful photos we’ve ever seen and are completely obsessed with them. We have looked back on our wedding day in the days since and I couldn’t be more grateful for Sarah-her talent, personality, and the genuine care she showed us. If you’re looking for someone to shoot your wedding day, anyone will do. But if you’re looking for a piece of sunshine and by far the most talented photographer I know (we’ve had professional pictures done multiple times), it has to be Sarah.

in 2020 due to Covid and she stuck by me throughout all the different changes. She is a natural and has a great eye for detail and photography. I had a backyard wedding and she picked the perfect spot in front of the home for photos after we said our vows. It looks like we’re in the middle of a forest and not on the sidewalk in the middle of the suburbs! I highly recommend Sarah. She will work with you, but will also give you her suggestions.

work with. My partner and I are the sort that don't typically enjoy being the center of attention, but Sarah has a warm, friendly presence that instantly put us at ease. We chose Sarah over other Bay Area photographers based on her portfolio, reviews and flexibility - she customized a package for us that suited our needs, preferences and budget, and was game for taking photos with our cute but uncooperative senior dogs. We received our photos just under three weeks following the wedding and could not be happier with the results!
