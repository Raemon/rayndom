### Best Overall Blue Bridal Shoes: Loeffler Randall Camellia Blue Pleated Bow Heel 

![Best Overall Blue Bridal Shoes](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/0fe1d2ee-a549-4fea-8c45-e7eea6897dec~rs_768.h-cr_0.200.800.1000)

_Photo: Loeffler Randall_

These wildly popular Loeffler Randall heels are available in a few different colors, but this perfect blue is a fan favorite. It's not hard to see why: The padded footbed and block-style heel make them more comfortable and sturdy than stilettos or pumps, and the signature pleated fabric creates an interesting texture. The heels also feature a feminine bow and dainty ankle strap, making them even prettier to look at. Heads up: The brand and shoppers recommend sizing up, as these can run a little narrow. 

**Standout review** : "I ordered the blue for my wedding day! I had originally ordered the white, but thought the blue would be different, and I am so glad I did. They are so beautiful!!! My fiancé even smiled when he saw them. The perfect mix of flirty but sophisticated, love love love!" – Nicky H., [Bloomingdales.com](https://bloomingdales.com/)

### Best Light Blue Bridal Shoes: Lulus Lyle Pointed-Toe Mules 

![Best Light Blue Bridal Shoes](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/984d3c86-9c32-45a7-861d-0ea41a2aec21~rs_768.h-cr_0.140.560.700)

_Photo: Lulus_

The beautiful light blue shade of these Lulus shoes makes them a perfect match for a white wedding dress—a blue that is too deep or dark can feel a little harsh against pure white or even ivory. The elevated mule is a classic style that has a touch of vintage flair, made of a smooth satin with a heel that is just tall enough for some height. They're easy to slip on and off (key when you're switching between photos and dancing), and the oversized bow is the cutest detail. But one of the best parts has to be the budget-friendly price point, which comes in at under $50. 

**Standout review** : "I got married in July and wore these as my 'something blue' on my wedding day, and they were perfect!! I absolutely loved them and got so many compliments on them. I loved how the heel wasn't too tall, so they were comfortable to walk in. They also looked super cute in the photos!" – Kelli W., [Lulus.com](https://lulusfashionloungellc.sjv.io/c/64733/1810759/21545?subId1=Theknot.com-something-blue-wedding-shoes&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lulus.com)

### Best Dusty Blue Bridal Shoes: Dolce Vita Poppi Platform Sandal 

![Best Dusty Blue Bridal Shoes](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/2dbfff13-d2f3-421a-bca9-bcfdf6d93e53~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1280.960)

_Photo: DSW_

Dusty blue, which is a mix of blue with grayish tones, is so pretty with a white or ivory dress, as it's more muted than bright. These shoes are both beautiful to look at and super-comfortable. That's thanks to the platform and block heel—both offer much more stability and comfort (along with plenty of height). The ankle strap and bow detail are both cute, feminine touches that make these feel special. 

**Standout review** : "Bought these for a wedding, and didn't take them off once!! I'm a true 8, and these fit perfect. I wore them for about 12 hours with hours of dancing, and they didn't blister or create any [discomfort] at all. I recommend to anyone looking for a nice, but comfortable shoe!" – Francesca, [DSW.com](https://dsw.am3t9s.net/c/64733/315836/4837?subId1=Theknot.com-something-blue-wedding-shoes&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dsw.com)

### Best White and Blue Bridal Shoes: Dolce Vita Cleo Heels

_Photo: Dolce Vita_

If you're okay with not adding a lot of height, these Dolce Vita kitten heels are a gorgeous option. The mesh, white, and blue mix is feminine and sweet, with cute details like a pointed toe, small bow and a teeny tiny heel. They're easy to slip on and off, and the mesh fabric makes them a little extra breathable, which is ideal when you know you'll be wearing them for hours on end. The floral print also means these are perfect for a spring or summer wedding. 

**Standout review** : "I love them, they are comfortable and I'm not slipping out of them. I love the mesh material because it has a bit of stretch and I feel more confident walking around in rainy Seattle. Received a bunch of compliments already." – Mary N., [DolceVita.com](https://dolcevita.com/)

### Best Low Heel Blue Bridal Shoes: Reformation Waldena Block Heeled Mule

_Photo: Reformation_

A low heel definitely doesn't need to be less glamorous than stilettos, and these Reformation heels are proof of that. The extra two inches offer a little height but don't make them feel perilously high or uncomfortable, and the fact that these are block heels means they have even more support. The shell-like design makes them pretty and very unique, and the double satin material is so soft. 

**Size range** : 5–11 | **Heel height** : 2 inches   
**Price at time of publication** : $248

_Photo: Bloomingdale's_

It's hard to go wrong with a classic pump like these. They're elegant, sophisticated and timeless, with a look that makes them seem much more expensive than they are. The light blue color is a great match for a white or ivory gown, and the crystal buckle is a pretty, sparkly touch that doesn't feel too overwhelming. Plus, while these might look a little uncomfortable, shoppers swear they feel surprisingly good on their feet. 

**Standout review** : "Beautiful quality. I got these for my wedding day. Gifted to me by my Mom. I couldn't be more thrilled, they're just gorgeous!" – Jacqueline K., [Bloomingdales.com](https://bloomingdales.com/)

Whether you want to skip heels altogether or have a pair of comfortable flats to slip into toward the end of the night, these Kailee P. flats should be a contender. Made of buttery soft satin with pretty details, these look and feel special enough for your wedding day, and allow you to look stylish without compromising on comfort. They're also a little customizable: You can choose between a bow at the ankle, straps for a lace-up look or a pearl ankle strap. 

**Standout review** : "These shoes are great! They're comfortable and better than I expected. I can't wait to wear them on my wedding day." – Mackenzie H., [KaileeP.com](https://www.kaileep.com/)

### Best Blue Satin Bridal Shoes: Steve Madden Teacup Blue Satin Heels 

![Best Blue Satin Bridal Shoes](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/62cad21e-15d2-4ab2-850f-9d4cc244504d~rs_768.h-cr_0.400.1600.2000)

_Photo: Steve Madden_

As gorgeous as these Steve Madden heels are, we have to be honest: You need to be confident in your ability to wear heels to make these work for your wedding day. The heel is just over four inches tall, and it's skinny, meaning there's not quite as much support as a block heel. That said, these are gorgeous, with an oversized bow detail at the back of the ankle and a pointed toe for added elegance. The satin material gives them a really beautiful sheen. 

**Standout review** : "These are the most perfect pump. I can't even stand it. The bow, the fabric, the height, the width, everything about these is just perfection. I'm not engaged, but let me tell you I bought a pair in anticipation of them being my wedding shoe because they are that perfect." – Ashley, [SteveMadden.com](https://stevemadden.com/)

### Best Blue Wedding Sandals: Loeffler Randall Malia Blue Satin Curved-Heel Sandal 

![Best Blue Wedding Sandals](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/be6cc062-bb41-4a42-955c-32b6e9b9363a~rs_768.h-cr_0.200.800.1000)

_Photo: Loeffler Randall_

These Loeffler Randall shoes are a gorgeous take on the classic heeled sandal. This style is perfect for brides getting married in warmer weather (think destination beach weddings, spring garden weddings, etc.) and is surprisingly versatile enough to work with a variety of dress styles. The curved heel on these makes them a little more interesting, and the block style gives them a sturdier feel. The padded footbed adds to the comfort. These are also made with luxe Italian suede, so they will definitely feel special enough for your big day. 

**Standout review** : "I wore the Malia's (blue satin) for my rehearsal dinner and welcome party, and couldn't recommend them enough. The shoes are comfortable and such a gorgeous color. I look forward to wearing them again! They required almost no break in wear (I think I wore them around for one evening). This particularly highlights the comfort of these shoes, given the low stretch of the satin. Buyer be warned, the satin on these shoes is absolutely gorgeous, but delicate and easily stained. The color is true to the photos." – Victoria P., [LoefflerRandall.com](https://www.pntrs.com/t/8-12275-88550-191217?sid=Theknot.com-something-blue-wedding-shoes&website=177979&url=https%3A%2F%2Floefflerrandall.com)

### Best Sparkly Blue Bridal Shoes: Bella Belle Athena Blue Crystal Block Heels 

![Best Sparkly Blue Bridal Shoes](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/b4a71f48-bc34-4934-a653-cab09f7411a9~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1000.1000)

_Photo: Bella Belle_

One shopper described these Bella Belle heels as a "true Cinderella shoe," and honestly? That description is perfect. They're made of luxe materials like silk and mesh and come in a light blue shade reminiscent of the Disney princess. The true star of the show, though, is the glittering crystal-embellished bow on the pointed toe. By the way, those crystals were designed specifically for brides and are not supposed to pull on your dress at all. The delicate ankle strap is a nice touch, but it is also removable if you want a slightly different look. These are also very comfortable, with a block heel for support and a super-padded footbed, so you can wear them for hours on end. 

**Standout review** : "I truly felt like the Disney princess I've always wanted to be! They were the most comfortable heeled shoes I've worn! Utterly beautiful, and they were complimented by everyone! A true Cinderella shoe" – Kate, [BellaBelle.com](https://www.bellabelleshoes.com/)

These Sam Edelman shoes have all the glamour: They're made of a luxe satin, with a uniquely shaped heel and dainty ankle strap. The standout feature, though, is obviously the oversized bow at the open toe, which has a little crystal embellished detail that adds just a touch of sparkle. These are fun, feminine and playful, but also sexy and bridal at the same time. The blue-gray color also makes them work nicely with a white dress without appearing too bold. 

**Standout review** : "I bought these shoes for my wedding. The shoe is absolutely beautiful. They look just like the picture online. Gorgeous color—I love that they are slightly blue." – Take, [SamEdelman.com](https://www.samedelman.com/)

### Best Cheap Budget Friendly Blue Bridal Shoes: LifeStride Last Dance

_Photo: Zappos_

These LifeStride heeled sandals are a favorite among shoppers for how comfortable they are, and the lower price point, which comes in at less than $100, isn't bad either. These feature a sturdy block heel, an adjustable ankle strap for extra support, and a small platform to keep you feeling more balanced. While comfortable and durable, these are still feminine and sweet thanks to the bow detail and princess-like light blue shade. 

**Standout review** : "I must say, these are probably some of the sturdiest heels I've walked in. I'm heavy set, so the pressure on the ball of my foot most heels cause can get really uncomfortable. With the little platform on these, I feel like I'm walking normally! I've gotten a lot of compliments on them, too." – Anonymous, [Zappos.com](https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8213893-11554337?sid=Theknot.com-something-blue-wedding-shoes&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.zappos.com%2Fkratos%2Fc%2Fzappos-homepage)

These Something Bleu shoes are proof that sometimes simple really is best. With a minimalist style that is elegant and perfectly delicate, these are a versatile pick that works with many different dress styles and seasons. They have a pretty pointed toe, a small ankle strap and a classic pump style. While pricey, these are made of high-quality Italian satin and look and feel special enough to justify that price point if you can. 

**Standout review** : "I got them for my wedding in June. They are modern, but elegant. The slightly pointed angle at the toe makes them unique. True to size." – Claudia M., [SomethingBleu.com](https://somethingbleushoes.com/)

**Size range** : 5.5–10 | **Heel height** : 3 inches   
**Price at time of publication** : $395
