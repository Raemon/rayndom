Jeff Craft

Owner/DJ

As a veteran of over 100 bands and 1000's of live shows including TV and radio, my life is music. I started playing drums at age 12 ,and expanded into being a DJ as well as writing,producing and releasing music. I also play bass, piano, and sing These skills allow me to offer custom song packages and give me a well rounded perspective of music and events While playing festivals is my favorite thing to do playing weddings is my second favorite as it gives me great joy to enhance such a special day I also was a chef for many years and catered many weddings I also owned and operated a windsurfing school with 2 locations in San Francisco

If you want fun and entertainment while having all of your music and DJ needs fulfilled pick DJ Z. He was so easy to work with, more than met my expectations, and required little d...

irection. DJ Z actually elevated the musical experience with his wide and fun array of costumes, props, and special equipment. Bubbles, strobe lights, a disco ball and special light effects assured audience engagement. Laughter and smiles were evident on the dance floor while DJ Z kept the crowd happy. He also let us use his equipment for announcements and games. His playlist is extensive, sound quality superb, and he willingly takes requests. I highly recommend DJ Z for all of your music needs.
