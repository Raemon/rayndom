About this vendor

Oaks Jewelers, located in Berkeley, California, offers its clients personalized service and a collection of jewelry and gifts for weddings and other celebrations. The company has a long history of friendly service and custom jewelry creation since opening its doors to the public in 1948. Couples can rely on this dedicated team of professionals to curate the best jewelry for their special day. This family-owned business has passed down its knowledge and values to Melissa and Adam, the current owners. After working at the business for over a decade, Melissa took over the company from her father, Jeff, in 2022, and worked alongside her grandfather Henry until he retired at the impressive age of 92. Her partner Adam was a second-generation goldsmith for his family’s company before they merged their talents into Oaks Jewelers. Oaks Jewelers does not take a "one size fits all" approach with its clients. Oaks believes your engagement ring and wedding band should be as unique and special as you are, and they take the time to really understand your wants and needs. They will carefully consider your style preferences, budget, and lifestyle to help find or create the perfect ring for you. They are also happy to help repurpose your heirloom jewelry by incorporating the original gems and metal into a new custom designed piece. The company has a vast collection of jewelry to choose from, as well as gift items. Oaks is happy to help curate a collection of bridal party gifts including engraved gift items, personalized jewelry, watches, and more. The team will work with you to choose the perfect engagement ring, wedding bands, and bridal jewelry, and strives to be your lifelong jeweler for anniversaries, birthdays, and other future milestones. In addition to new purchases, they also offer repair services such as ring sizing, stone setting, and metal soldering. Reach out to Melissa, Adam, and their hardworking team today for custom-built designs.

When my fiance gave me his grandmother's art deco engagement ring from 1933, I knew that we needed to find a special jeweler to help us create a wedding band to match it. Oaks Jew...

elers is a family-run business &amp; has been around since 1948. The staff are extra helpful, the prices are reasonable and my husband and I are both very pleased with the rings that we bought there. The custom-made band matches my engagement ring perfectly. We were so happy with the service that we took in an antique broach to have it restored &amp; it came back looking great! I HIGHLY recommend this jeweler. We will go back for years to come.
