Instead of wood, opt for something a little more unique with these interesting clear acrylic hangers. They feature nonslip sides so the dress doesn't slip right off, and you can add their name right to the front. Add a bow if you want, or leave it off if it doesn't feel like the right vibe.

## Wedding Dress Hanger FAQ 

A bridal hanger comes in handy when it's time to [store your wedding dress](https://www.theknot.com/content/store-wedding-dress-before-wedding), but you want to make sure that it's not going to alter your gown in any way. Properly storing and hanging your dress is key, whether it's months before the big day or just the morning of. Here are some things to keep in mind when picking a hanger. 

### What is the best way to hang a wedding dress?

Hanging your wedding gown by a window or in a nice spot is fine for the morning of the wedding, but in the weeks and months leading up to the big day, you'll want to keep it lying flat in a [wedding dress garment bag](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-dress-garment-bag). This helps to avoid wrinkles and keeps dust and debris away from your gown. You can keep your wedding dress on a hanger in the garment bag, especially if you want to use the personalized one you purchased, but be mindful of the style of the gown and the material of the hanger. 

Most dresses, especially strapless dresses, will have fabric inner straps that are specifically meant to be used when hanging your dress during storage. Use these (or get them added if your dress doesn't have them) instead of the actual straps of the gown—over time, hanging them can leave them stretched out. Choose a soft or smooth hanger for your dress to ensure that nothing gets caught in the material, and try to find a hanger with notches so that the dress doesn't slip right off. 

### How do you hang a strapless wedding dress?

Strapless wedding gowns should have inner straps that are meant to be used when storing the dress. Your dress can be hung from these inner straps—don't use hanger clips to hang the gown, as this can end up snagging on the fabric or stretching the bodice. Since these inner straps are thin and silky, pick a hanger with notches or a textured material that offers some grip, otherwise they may slip off. 

### How do you hang a wedding dress with a train?

If your gown has a long train, you want to make sure that it's stored so that the train doesn't get wrinkly or similarly ruined. Look at the inside bottom of your dress train, and you should find a small fabric loop (similar to those inner straps). This is meant to be looped over the top of your hanger to allow the train to hang properly. If your dress doesn't have this, for some reason, get one added by a tailor—it really allows your train to drape correctly and makes it easier to slip it into a garment bag neatly.
