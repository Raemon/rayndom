We checked out several photographers before deciding to go with Robin at Robin Gerrard Photography for my daughter's wedding. Honestly, the majority of photographers seemed to be f...

olks that had just drifted into wedding photography. Some of their photos had lighting issues or were just amateur shots. I am so happy Robin was recommended to us! Even though we are in different cities, we spoke by phone, email and in person prior to the wedding. When the wedding day arrived,We had total confidence that Robin would capture the day perfectly and she certainly did. The resulting photos are magical...pure art! Robin worked so well with us as well as our wedding planner on the itinerary for the day. Everyone knew exactly when and where they had to be for the photos. Robin even had excellent suggestions for how the couple should depart the wedding in order to get the best photos. I never had to worry about a thing. Robin captured not only the events, emotions and moments, but truly the feel of the day. Robin and her team were unobtrusive throughout the entire day, yet they managed to get the most amazing shots. We had rain for most of the day, yet the photos are absolutely beautiful. If you are just looking at the photos, you would have no idea we had a torrential downpour! The way Robin organizes and categorizes the finished photos makes it so easy to look through them and choose your favorites. In addition, Robin provided a mobile app for me and my daughter which allows us to quickly show others 200 of our favorite photos. I look at this all the time myself! Robin's albums are beautiful. We plan to order one as soon as we can pick our favorites from all the beautiful photos

We highly recommend wedding photographer, Robin Gerrard, and her assistant, Jenn. We recently hired Robin to photograph our daughter’s wedding in Charlotte, NC. Robin’s photos were...

exquisite!! The colors were vibrant and the images were sharp and clear. Moreover, Robin is very professional and personable. She captured the best moments of the wedding and reception without being intrusive. She chose the most beautiful outdoor scenes around the Marriott SouthPark Hotel as well as our daughter’s favorite keepsakes of her wedding, including her wedding gown hanging against the backdrop of the gardens and patio. We loved the photos of family and friends during the cocktail hour and dancing in the ballroom. Initially, she sent us a template to create a Wedding Timeline beginning with the getting ready phase through the final dance. This was immensely helpful in getting us organized. We are so grateful to Robin and Jenn because we will cherish memories of our daughter and son in-law’s wedding through their beautiful photos!

WOW. Where to begin? I chose Robin Gerrard based off her gorgeous portfolio on her website, but also because of how she described her style, 'a mix of portrait artists, photojour...

nalists, and story-tellers.' This is exactly what we got. While all of our portrait and group portrait shots were beautifully done, it was the 'in the moment' photos that we will treasure even more. Robin has an intuitive talent for capturing people when they are being themselves. I know some members of my family immediately put on a serious face when they know they're being photographed, so it means a lot to me to have memories of them smiling, laughing, and naturally showing their joy for our day. Robin and Jenn arrived early and were so warm and professional from the start. I had asked the wedding coordinator about suggestions for "First Look" locations around our venue and while they were pretty, I was worried that the strong Carolina sun would make for harsh photos. Robin had already scouted the area and found locations I had no idea existed. Needless to say, they came out beautifully (and in much softer lighting!) Robin was pivotal in keeping everyone on schedule. Everyone involved with the ceremony can get side-tracked and her direction kept the day flowing. Lastly, no one can believe we got our photos back as soon as we did. From everyone I've talked to, just over two weeks from the wedding is basically unheard of. Then I show them the amazing quality of the photos and it becomes even more unbelievable. I can't thank Robin enough. The day goes by so quickly, but these photos will be happy reminders for the rest of our lives!

g which was a huge stress relief and took away any concerns that things would go awry. Weeks leading up to the wedding she provided us with all the information we needed so that we could properly prepare and be sure that we got every photo we wanted. Day of the wedding she showed up on time ran us through the portrait part of the wedding flawlessly. During the ceremony, cocktail hour and reception she was undetectable. After the wedding she got us our proofs in two weeks which is by far the quickest I've heard of and Im old so all my friends are already married. The photo are amazing, all we could have asked for an more. I would hire her again in a heartbeat and I would recommend you do the same. A+ 5-Star Rating. Thank you Robin for everything and best of luck to you and your business!

as well. It rained a good part of the day but the pictures were still so beautiful! She did an amazing job capturing our wedding day. Afterwards it was a quick turn around to get my photos. She uploaded my album on her website making it easy to share with friends/family, put 200 of my favorite photos on a mobile app so I can easily access them on my phone, and sent me a flash drive with all the pictures as well. I would definitely recommend her to other brides!

I still can’t believe how lucky we were to have picked Robin as our photographer! Not only was she a wonderful photographer (everyone keeps gushing about how great our pictures are...

, and I’ve been looking at them on repeat since they’ve come in), but she’s also the sweetest, easiest person to work with. We had our pictures back to us two weeks after our wedding, which was record time compared to many of our friends who got married recently. Also, we ended up with SO MANY photos. I think Robin took double the number of pictures from my brother’s wedding (just a month before us). The hardest part is now picking which photos I want to put in a wedding album because they’re all amazing photos. Seriously, if you’re unsure about a photographer, Robin is the ABSOLUTE BEST.

assionate she is about her work. Robin shot our engagement and wedding. From the time we first met up until the day of the wedding Robin kept constant communication between the vendors and me to ensure we were all aligned on the schedule. I never felt uncomfortable or hesitant around Robin and her team, in fact she kept me so calm! I did not have a videographer for my wedding so candid shots were really important to me, if you want to see everything you missed at your wedding Robin WILL make that happen. From the getting ready shots, bridal portraits, ceremony, romantics, reception, all of the beautiful details incorporated in our wedding to our sparkler exit, Robin captured every moment. There are so many tears of joy when I look back at the pictures and the gorgeous photo album Robin created. We had endless guests compliment our engagement photos and wedding photos. I can hardly wait to book another shoot with Robin, she gave me everything I wanted and more in a photographer. The absolute best!

We were recently married in mid-October and had the pleasure of working with Robin and Laura as our photographers. We would highly recommend them with the utmost enthusiasm. From...

the moment we first had contact with Robin we knew she would be the perfect photographer for our big day. We did a lot of research online and after seeing website pictures from both Robin and Laura, we completely fell in love with their natural style of photography and ability to capture the beauty in a moment, including amazing still images. Leading up to our wedding, communication with Robin was efficient and prompt. It might seem insignificant to most, but when you’re working with multiple vendors trying to pull everything together at once having quick responses to questions is very helpful. Robin was very clear in all correspondence before the wedding, including a very detailed sample timeline that really helped us organize our wedding day and to make sure all events we wanted were captured. Robin and Laura arrived early on wedding day and were careful throughout the day about giving us space without missing any important moments. Their work really stood out from other photographers, and more importantly “told the story” of our big day. Robin said that she liked to be a “silent observer” rather than disrupting guests and asking for posed pictures. She and Laura blended into the background, managing to capture every single special moment! Robin and Laura did not stop taking pictures for eight hours straight. They were there from our “getting ready” moments in two separate locations, to our off-site shoot with the wedding party and culminating with our grand exit from the reception. Within a few weeks after our wedding, we had a link in our inbox to over 1,000 pictures. All of the pictures were organized well into albums and included a “highlights” album with 200 images from across our wedding day. These pictures were absolutely stunning, and had the same romantic, journalistic touch that we had seen in all of their previous work. The final product was AMAZING!

Robin was fantastic! I put more importance on a photographer (didn't want a videographer) so my pictures were top of the list. Admittedly, she is quite pricy compared to other phot...

ographers; however, she captured wonderful photos, visited the location prior to the wedding to be familiar with the venue, and was always available via text/call/email. In addition, she includes a photo album which could not be MORE AMAZING. It is fabulous, the best quality I have ever seen and she was wonderful to work with to put it together, and then took my vision and improved upon it before printing. I cannot stress how wonderful the quality and design of the album, we will cherish it for forever! One tip I would suggest to future brides is to be cognizant of her assistant - she does wonderful photos but given the assistant is with the groom you want to make sure that person is good as well. Would definitely recommend her services!

During the Wedding, Robin did a great job of getting natural and candid shots which was one of the main things we wanted out of our Wedding photos. She worked seamlessly with the crowd and you hardly even knew she was there. We were happy with the end result. Robin also met with me after our Wedding to help me design our Wedding album, which I really appreciated. She goes out of her way to give you a good experience. I really enjoyed working with her.

king for someone to capture your magic in a personalized, photo journalistic manner, one in which you feel the moment when looking back at the images, you absolutely have to go with Robin and her team. Our day was chaotic (as weddings tend to be). Robin stayed calm and collected throughout. Her organization made the family picture time go as seamlessly as possible, and her relaxed demeanor kept me feeling grounded. There’s something magical about that woman! Robin was very professional and communicative from day 1, and she carried that on throughout the wedding and with follow up after. If we could do our wedding all over again, there are a few things we would have changed, but having Robin and her team capture it certainly wouldn’t have been one of them. The photos themselves were delivered quickly and organized in a manner that has made it easy for us to sort through them. They’re so beautiful, and my husband and I couldn’t be happier with the results. Thank you Robin for being our extra set of eyes on our big day! We can’t wait to look back on these pictures for the rest of our lives. Xx

Robin Gerrard is not only extraordinarily talented, but is the most professional vendor we worked with while planning our wedding. She made us feel thought of, cared for, and most ...

importantly, heard while helping us work through timeline, specific moments we wanted captured, and order of events. Robin was consistently quick to respond to every email we sent her and was thorough and thoughtful in all of her responses and suggestions. She gave us feedback and opinions when she thought it would benefit us, but was accommodating by trying to give us everything we wanted on our special day. Many of the photos she shared with us, just 3 weeks after our wedding, took our breath away! There are some images that are so stunning that we've joked that they belong in bridal magazines, not just on our walls at home. Robin went above and beyond to capture all of the moments that we felt were important, but also surprised us with candid, genuine moments that we didn't realize she was there for. When looking for a photographer we were adamant that the person be able to beautifully capture our day in an authentic, genuine, and organic way -- We didn't want too many posed, stiff, or formal photos -- and she achieved this perfectly! Any bride would be LUCKY to have such a talented, hardworking and kind photographer be a part of their big day!! Ultimately, your desire is to have a gorgeous affair and be married, but the only thing that lives on long after the wedding day, after the honeymoon, after decades of marriage, is the photographic evidence. It's a tall order to expect someone to give you those memories in a stunning way, but Robin did that tenfold!

She stayed in touch with us monthly if not more frequently during our planning to answer questions, help pick out what albums we wanted, and to help with various other aspects of the planning. She was always very professional and very accessible via email or phone and was phenomenal to work with. My husband and I are extremely pleased with our pictures and albums. The albums have every picture that we wanted and they are beautifully made. We had smaller albums made for our families as gifts, and our family members absolutely love them! I am very satisfied with our photos and how well the photography was done at our wedding and reception and would highly recommend this vendor.

ed! My now-husband and I were initially drawn to the work on their website, but with both of us always feeling a bit awkward in front of a camera, and usually not very photogenic, we were not sure how well we would do. As it turns out it was a great experience because they were both very friendly and immediately put us at ease, and anyway, other than during our portraits we hardly knew they were there because they work so quietly and seemed to be invisible a lot of the time! Most importantly the results are so beautiful I can’t stop looking through the pictures. Every photograph taken of us is nothing short of perfection!

hat turned out not to be a problem at all because even though most of our planning was done by email, Robin was always very responsive, friendly, and willing to answer our many wedding questions, and even helped with advice about a couple of things that went beyond photography. While getting ready on my wedding day my hair stylist told me that Robin has a phenomenal reputation in the field, and my makeup artist overheard us talking and chimed in her agreement too! After the experience of working with Robin and her team (two photographers and an assistant), and seeing our incredibly beautiful wedding photos, I can see why. They are kind, easy going, creative, talented and really everything I could have hoped for in my wedding photographers!

Robin was great to work with. We were able to communicate via Skype with ease. She was always prompt with replies to questions, so we felt confident despite not meeting her until...

the day of the wedding. We love our photos, and we are looking forward to our album!

We had a lot of fun working with Robin. She took our engagement and wedding photos. She was very easy to get in contact with, and was always flexible with our busy schedules. Robin...

had so many ideas to offer, and was able to capture beautiful moments even with ordinary backgrounds. There were so many awesome moments that I get to re-live as I look at the pictures. She had a way of capturing moments that I didn't even see happen! We would definitely recommend her to anyone in the Charlotte/Atlanta area!

Robin photographed my son's and daughter-in-law's wedding in the afternoon/evening at an inside/outside venue. Robin was able to capture beautiful photographs of everyone all afte...

rnoon and evening... especially the bride and groom in the most picturesque areas, utilizing the sunlight, moonlight, and the soft venue lighting available. During some of the most special moments of the wedding, ie, the wedding itself, the bride and groom dance, the father-daughter dance, the cake cutting, etc., I could see Robin out of the corner of my eye capturing every detail. And, after seeing all of the photographs that she provided, I realized that she discreetly captured so many other moments showing the love, joy, and happiness that everyone felt. Thank-you, Robin, for making the wedding so memorable!

Robin, is a nice person and a good professional. She is very detailed with things specially for the album, she puts lots of effort in everything. It was good working with her.

We had such a great experience working with Robin. She was always accessible by email or phone and she was very flexible with our busy schedule (in scheduling an engagement shoot)....

She was very helpful in coming up with a "day of" schedule, which was critical for the day to go smoothly! Without her, I would have had no idea what I was doing. Robin has done this hundreds of times, so know that you can lean on her if you have any questions about a good "day of" schedule! She was very open to any ideas we had for photograph poses (we had many) and was willing to try anything! Along with that, she was a great photojournalist of our wedding, capturing every moment perfectly with her camera. There were so many sweet moments that I didn't get to see happen until I looked at her pictures. She has a way of being everywhere all at once. We loved having her alongside us on our wedding day, she was always very friendly and versatile to whatever (or whoever) came her way! I would definitely recommend her to a friend.

Robin was a dream! I'm so glad we choose her to be our wedding photographer. My favorite things about Robin were her flexibility, patience, calm, and OF COURSE her talent! I was ou...

t of state, so I never even met Robin until our wedding day. However, I felt 100% comfortable with her because she was always so thorough and accommodating via phone and e-mail when planning our wedding day. During the wedding, Robin made a deliberate point to make sure we had every photo taken that we had discussed ahead of time. She was able to gracefully coordinate family members and the wedding party and worked seamlessly with other vendors to make my wedding day magical. Somehow, she managed to do all this while remaining under the radar. Additionally, we got our photos back online super quickly - I was expecting it to take much longer than it did. MOST IMPORTANTLY, our photos are gorgeous! We got married in a front of a fireplace in some difficult lighting conditions and Robin nailed it! Robin captured our day beautifully and I'm thrilled to have her images to remember our day during the years to come. If you're looking for a photographer with an eye for creating classic, timeless and elegant photos, I can't recommend Robin more highly!

We just got done taking our engagement photos and could not be happier with the results. Robin and her husband came out to meet us at the location we chose, a place they had not sh...

ot before, and were amazingly helpful and friendly. Neither my fiance nor I are very comfortable in front of a camera, but with Robin we had no problem smiling and ended up having a ton of fun!! She gave us enough direction where we were not just standing there awkwardly but allowed us to be ourselves at the same time. We highly recommend using Robin for any wedding, and after receiving our engagement pictures, we can't wait to have Robin do our big day!
