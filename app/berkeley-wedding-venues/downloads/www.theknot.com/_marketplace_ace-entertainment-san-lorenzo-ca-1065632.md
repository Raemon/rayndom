We had the ABSOLUTE honor and privilege of having Elyzar as our DJ and emcee for our wedding, and couldn’t have asked for a better person for the job. Booking with Elyzar was proba...

bly one of the best things we did for our wedding. He was so thorough in prepping for the wedding, having multiple calls with us to walk us through the planning process and make sure that we got the reception of our dreams. He also went so far as to cut/edit our songs for the first dance and father/daughter dance, helped us navigate parts in the reception when we strayed a bit from the timeline, and just took care of making everything flow so well so that we didn’t have to think during the reception and could just enjoy ourselves. Not only did we have the best time at our reception thanks to Elyzar, but our guests did too! We’re still (10+ days after the wedding) getting compliments from guests on how fun and immaculate the vibes were at the reception, because of Elyzar. Elyzar brought the perfect amount of professionalism and hyphy. He read the room incredibly well and was able to adapt based on whatever the crowd was feeling, to keep the good vibes flowing. We wholeheartedly recommend booking with him for your next big event!

My Wife and I wish we could give Rob a higher rating but there were too many cons that outweighed the pros. While choosing our wedding venue, we found Rob on the list of the venu...

es preferred vendors. Based on his social media, it appeared that he really knew how to get a crowd going and have fun. That is what ultimately helped us choose him. We will say this, Rob is an amazing DJ and definitely knows how to get the crowd going. He definitely understands what it takes to make events lively and we appreciate that. However, there are quite a few things that made for a poor experience. From our first meeting, Rob was late and we were left waiting for his call. But people are human, things happen. No big deal. However. once he did call, his attention did not seem at all focused on us. By the end of the meeting we were still left with many questions and it took some time to get them answered. We chose to go with his Gold Package. This included a 3 Person Staff (MC,DJ, Sound). 6 hours of service. Ceremony, Cocktail Hour, Reception set-ups. 4 Hour Digital Spade Photo Booth Package to include: Up to 4 Hours of Photo Booth - Digital Photo Booth - Variety of Props - Our exquisite Spade booth offers Video Messaging, Photos , Gif/Boomerang - Customized Gallery for guests to look at the event. Rob did not contact us about any plans, designs, song choices etc until about a week before the event. We tried getting in contact with him for over a month but it was not until we asked our event coordinator to reach out to him since he is a preferred vendor for the the venue. We went over song choices after finally getting a hold of him but needed to finalize a design for our Photo Booth print outs. He told us he was working on something new and would send us examples. We did not hear back from him on the examples and did not see what the design looked like until about 3 hours before the event. What was also frustrating was that we did not notice any other help during the event. We did not see this “3 person staff” which was said in the package. No one was stationed at the Photo Booth. No props for the Photo Booth were available. Many photos from the booth came out blurry. What was finally the last straw for us was trying to get digital copies of the Photo Booth. Within the same week after the wedding, we asked for digital copies of the Photo Booth. Rob assured us he would send it but this went on for months. Our wedding was August 2024, and until now, we still have not received the digital copies. We reached out about once a month asking for a follow up and Rob kept saying he’d send it over but still has not. Ultimately, his level of professionalism is what warranted the rating we gave. He’s a great DJ, but difficult to work with when it comes to any other needs.

We hired Ace Entertainment in November of 2021 for our wedding in June of 2023. We knew with people rescheduling postponed weddings due to covid that securing vendors could be a ch...

allenge, so we started early. We met Robert at a wedding fair in Santa Clara. He made us feel very confident about hiring Ace Entertainment; they offered DJ and photo booth packages that seemed to fit our needs so we signed a contract for the Gold Package with 2 additional hours of the Spade Photo booth and paid the deposit. Unfortunately, this is the last truly positive experience we had with Ace Entertainment. There was no communication whatsoever unless I reached out and asked what steps needed to be taken. A little more than a month out from our wedding date, we still had not heard from Ace about any details of our wedding, so I reached out. They sent me a stock email asking me select a time and date on a pre-scheduled calendar for a phone meeting. Someone from Ace called us on May 10th, although they never identified who they were, and spent about 15 minutes basically reading the outline/schedule that we had previously filled out and had emailed once we scheduled the meeting. We were told at this meeting that we could put together a Spotify playlist of requested songs, we also had put together a playlist for the pre-ceremony music we wanted, so we texted both links to the phone number of whomever we were discussing our wedding with (again, he never mentioned his name) and were told that we were all set. On June 7th, I reached out to get the names of the employees who would be working our wedding so that we could add them to our table arrangement. They replied 2 days before the wedding with the names but the signs had already been printed. At this point, with how little communication was happening, I was genuinely worried we would not have a DJ at our wedding. The day of arrived and the people working the wedding did an ok job (I do not know their names as they never introduced themselves) but they definitely did not do what they said they would do. They did not play a single requested song from our playlist!! They also played only 1 slow song the entire evening, which was the last song of the night that my husband and I had picked out specifically for that moment! The song our parents walked down aisle to was started earlier than it was supposed to, our processional was not even lined up yet. So a part of the song played that was never intended, which completely changed the tone of our wedding. We actually had guests ask us about the song because it became so abruptly wrong for the occasion. Additionally, despite the fact that they knew we had someone doing a reading, only the officiant and the groom had microphones which were lapel mics, so only part of the reading and part of my vows were heard. They also did not provide any accessories with the photobooth as we had been told! To be perfectly honest, it felt like we were not an important client to them because we didn’t spend more money. We were so excited about them when we booked them and I ended up deeply regretting it. I would NOT recommend Ace Entertainment.

Imagine being announced as a wrong couple! hahahah I didn't know my husband's name is the same name as his BestMan. Imagine you being so excited to enter the reception only to hear...

a wrong name. What the hekkkkk! I think our wedding was pretty successful and all the vendors were true to their words except for Ace Entertainment. Rob will sell himself to you when you're inquiring but the moment you paid your deposit, and gave them the assurance you'll take them, that's it. it's about to go down. couple of things you want to ask them when you decide to hire them: -is my wedding the only wedding that day (we booked them May 2021 only to find out he double booked July 8th 2022) -1 week prior your first phone call with Rob text him everyday, call him every day until the day of your phone meeting because he will forget. (2 meetings, both late. or maybe just expect him not to be organizes) -is it a different MC on my wedding and are we going to be introduced to them? (on our 1st phone call which Rob was 20 mins late and I think he forgot we had a meeting promised that the MC and dj and the other 2 team members will be introduced to us but never did no wonder Pierre the MC was confused with our names) \- when you fill out a form and put the songs you want to play on the dance floor make sure to quadruple check with them if they are going to play those songs otherwise they won't (my bridesmaid worked hard to put songs on that Playlist but we only heard about 3 songs. what the hekkkk) -oh and last thing check if their microphones are working during the ceremony. or will it be half way on and off. (smh I'm just so disappointed) Pierre, it's no your fault to introduce us as Mr. and Mrs. (a totally different name) and not your fault to introduced us again as Albertson... at least I was able to yell from 10 ft to do it again properly and say MR. AND MRS. TSANG. idk I just felt we were profiled. Didn't want to give you a 1 star but, just don't want others to spend a lot of money and be given a service that's not worth the price.

Overall Ace Entertainment did a great job for our May 2021 wedding. Rob has a great energy and played all of our requested songs as asked. We had three different set ups (ceremon...

y, cocktail, reception). All equipment worked well and the switches went smoothly. Rob checked in with us frequently to keep us on our schedule which was great. Our guests had an awesome time dancing and he played fun upbeat music which really got everyone on the dance floor! My only complaint was communication. We had a tough time getting hold of Rob, or anyone in the company, the weeks before the wedding to confirm everything. After multiple emails and phone calls we finally heard back and everyone went smoothly from there. I think some of this had to do with COVID so hopefully the communication aspect will improve in the future.

edding at the Club at Ruby Hill in Pleasanton. We had a couple in person/phone meetings with Rob who helped assure us that our wedding would be top notch. DJ services were used for the ceremony and reception. We chose several songs to be played at certain times of the night and every song was played at the right time! We can’t thank Ace enough for for this because music to us is everything to capture the moment. The uplighting, patterned lights, and monogram lights just brought the venue to life. We chose pink rose uplighting and with the white walls it just looks like a wedding dream. The “dancing with the clouds” was the perfect touch to our first dance. Pictures came out beautiful for this moment. Photobooth with gif was fun for the guests and props were provided. This self operative photobooth is really unique and easy/fun for guests to use. Rob also was a great MC and got the crowd hyped for the grand entrances, program, and during the dancing portion. I had sent Rob a timeline of events for the wedding and he executed the events with ease. Rob and his crew set up on time and had everything going as planned. We would definitely have Rob and Ace entertainment at our future events! Thank you again for helping in making our wedding so epic!

My husband and I booked our DJ, Photo booth, and Lighting with Ace Entertainment for our wedding. The lighting was amazing (no complaints). The photo booth stopped working halfway ...

through the night and our guests were annoyed. It took many texts and phone calls in a course of about 2 months to get through Robert to give us a reimbursement. Finally, our DJ/music...we had a meeting with Robert (our DJ) before our wedding day and told him which songs we wanted for our bridal party grand entrances for our reception. We gave him everything (the timings of when to play the song, song titles, links to songs) ahead of time. He played the wrong song when introducing my parents. My parents had a cute choreography planned. AND for my husband and I's grand entrance song he played the wrong part of the song! I was so upset that he messed up OUR grand entrance song. My husband I practiced this for months. I was so sad and it really upset me. I felt like Robert didn't prepare for our reception even though things were provided to him and explained to him ahead of time.

knew we wanted him to DJ our reception. He was funny, organized, and professional. We had great time at our reception as did all of our guests. He played a great selection of music during dinner and never played anything from our do not play list! He even had a neat idea to play a bride and groom trivia game to determine which order the tables would be excused to get in the buffet line. It was a fun ice breaker for the guests and it allowed us a chance to actually eat our dinner! I highly recommend Ace Entertainment and would use them again if I ever needed a DJ.

Our wedding was on November 05,2011 at the Ole Hanson Beach Club in San Clemente. We had found Ace Entertainment at a wedding show in Anaheim that myself and 2 of my Bridesmaid had...

attended. Once we had made our appointment Johnathan drove all the way from San Dimas to meet us. My Husband and I had an instant connection with him. Everything they had to offer through Ace we loved and were so excited for the big day to come. They made it so easy for us to prepare for the wedding. They customized everything to our liking. Ron our DJ the day of the wedding was amazing and awesome! The biggest surprise to me was our Ceremony Music. Up until an hour before the wedding we thought we were going to have to play our music on a boom box due to the cities noise restrictions. To my surprise as I got ready to walk down the aisle I realized the Ron had set up all the speakers in a way the music projected and was Beautiful. Everything I had asked for and more.. They made the whole day come to life and had listened to all the requests my husband and I had made. It was perfect! Thank You Ace entertainment for everything. Smiles,Lexi Luciani

We recently were married at a winery in Temecula and used Ace Entertainment for both the ceremony and reception. Carlos was an amazing DJ. He filmed our ceremony for us and worked ...

the timeline wonderfully. I would reccomend them for their well thought out time table as well as music choice!

Ace Entertainment was conpetitively priced and rated best DJ by theknot.com. My husband and I met Jonathan Schlabs (owner and MC) at a bridal expo in November 2010. We paid $1000 f...

or their services (discounted because of the expo.) Jonathan met with us once after the expo to sign our contract and book our wedding date. The $1000 got us 6 hours of DJ and MC services- as the MC, Jonathan worked with our reception coordinator to keep the event running smoothly. We got to fill out a booklet (contract) and choose all of the songs we wanted played. You can opt out of that step and just pick genres if you want, but we had a lot of specific songs that are special to us that we wanted played. They were professional, affordable and showed up. They also surprised us with glow sticks, which was super fun and a nice touch! My complaints are that they were hard to get in contact with close to my wedding date (scary!) We were supposed to meet a second time right before the wedding at my reception venue to discuss set-up and lighting, this did not happen. When I emailed the company to ask questions, I would receive an out of office generic email instructing that I would hear back from them promptly. I didn't always have my questions answered, even going weeks with no substantial response. Another complaint is that they did not play the songs that my husband and I spent time selecting and including in our contract booklet. They played some of them, but they also played their own selections (ie: during dinner they played classical music that was nice, but it wasn't what we selected and spent time writing into our contract.) Another complaint is that we specifically asked for no songs to be played that have explicit lyrics. However, our DJ took a request from my 12 year old cousins (a rap song with explicit lyrics.) It was not only an inappropriate song, but was also an unfamiliar song, causing many guests to leave the dance floor. Really dissappointing. I hope that they read this review and make adjustments because I believe they are a great company that made some mistakes with us. I sincerely hope that they fix their emailing system and that they respect their clients' song choices when they spend the time filling out their contract.

I recently got married at the Disneyland Hotel and my husband and I chose Ace Entertainment for our DJ. We used their services for both our ceremony and reception. From the momen...

t we met with them they were friendly, professional, and helpful. They made sure that our wedding was on schedule and that everything was running smoothly. They also ensured that not only my husband and I were having a great time, but that everyone there was enjoying themselves. I had many guests compliment to me what a wonderful time they had and how they enjoyed the entertainment from the DJ. I would recommend Ace Entertainment to anyone planning their wedding. My husband and I could not be happier with their services.
