My wedding coordinator, Tiffany Kay Events by Design, recommended Team Bridal Beauty to me. I checked their Instagram and loved their makeup and hair looks and so I booked them for...

my bridal trial and wedding. My bridal trial was scheduled on the same day as my prenuptial photoshoot which worked out perfectly as I don't know how to fix myself up for these kind of things. I usually just wear a tinted lip balm, mascara, fill in my eyebrows, and maybe some blush. Hair wise, I usually just blow dry it or I'll add some curls. So hiring professionals was a must in my case. Sheryl did my makeup and I can honestly say that I loved her work. My face felt light and did not feel like I had layers of cake on it. It was something I can wear all day without feeling self conscious about it. I liked how it still looked like me, very natural, with some enhancements. I hope that makes sense! Linh is a bundle of energy and will definitely get you hyped up for your day. She is an expert in Hollywood waves and posing. She was able to use my halo extensions with the look which was great as I don't have naturally thick hair anymore. Lastly, Christine. She was the absolute best! She listened to all my concerns and delivered. We discussed the look I was going for both makeup and hair, and how we can enhance it as I am the bride. Our conversations as a whole were natural and calming. I felt like I knew her from before. Once she finished her work, I was so amazed and it excited me even more for my wedding day! I am excited to see how the complete look will look on my wedding day. I know that my bridesmaids and my mom will love her and her team!

We hired Team Bridal Beauty for our 2-day wedding weekend and we were so thrilled with their amazing service and finished results! Our team consisted of Christine, Linh, Thy, Prati...

and Wendy, and every single one of my bridesmaids, moms and grandmas, and myself had an exceptional experience. From my first few messages with Christine, she worked with me to tailor the best package for my needs. She was so friendly and responsive with all of my questions and requests. For the actual hair and makeup services, each of the artists listened and executed all of our visions! They helped answer questions and gave suggestions, and ultimately were all able to create the looks we wanted. Even for our moms who wanted minimal makeup and had very specific looks in mind, the artists worked with them to ensure they loved their looks. I would highly recommend Team Bridal Beauty to anybody looking for hair and makeup services in the Bay Area. The whole team was timely, so friendly, professional, and left us with amazing looks that we loved. Thank you to Christine, Linh, Thy, Prati, and Wendy!!

I can't believe I originally wanted to do my own hair and makeup for the wedding because I would not have looked as beautiful as I felt on my wedding day if I stuck with that plan....

For the brides who are thinking of doing your own hair and makeup, just hire the team! You deserve to be pampered on your wedding day for a few hours. The communication and booking was very smooth right from the start with TBB. We coordinated my bridal trial with Tham as my stylist and we got that done in their studio located just outside Oakridge Mall. Tham was very kind and professional. She asked me clarifying questions on what I liked about each of the sample photos and she explained to me why some things could be contradicting based on the different photos. After we agreed on a vision, she got straight to work and talked me through the process as she worked. The trial hair/makeup was beautiful and it stayed on all day. On the day of the wedding, Tham got to our hotel room and started on my mom's makeup. My mom does not wear makeup or do anything special with her hair ever so I had notes for Tham before she got started. Throughout the process, Tham adjusted things based on what my mom was comfortable with and it worked out so well in the end. For my own, we tweaked a few things based on what I noticed from the trial and we ended up doing a different updo that I loved even more. I had a long veil that people kept stepping on all day but my bun stayed strong and I didn't ever have to worry about it. I only had to powder my face and touch up my lipstick once throughout the day so I would call that a success. Overall so grateful for Tham and the TBB team for making my mom and I look incredible.

n for my hair. I just had my bridal trial today and it went extremely well! The artists were positive and made sure I was comfortable and happy with how I look. All in all, I'm so excited for my wedding day. I truly feel like I am in good hands. This is a post wedding day update! Leslie, Ann, and Kim did a phenomenal job with the hair and make up for my mom, bridesmaids, and me. They were very understanding and accommodating towards all of us, what our vision was, and any specific skincare or hair needs for each bridesmaid. As for myself, I actually changed my make up look to something softer and Leslie was more than happy and flexible to make that change for me. Kim also did a fabulous job with the touch up later in the day. Both make up artists made me feel like myself and beautiful on my wedding day, and the updo by Ann was just the cherry on top to make me feel like a princess! Overall everyone on my team, from Christine managing everything to the artists, Leslie, Ann, and Kim, was so easy to work with. They are professional, experienced, but also so personable and easy to talk to.

She took the time to listen to exactly what I wanted, offered helpful suggestions, and worked her magic to create a hairstyle that was even better than I had imagined. She has an amazing eye for detail and knew exactly how to enhance my features while ensuring my hair stayed flawless all day and night. Not only is Christine incredibly talented, but she also has a warm and friendly personality that makes the entire experience enjoyable. She truly cares about her clients and goes above and beyond to make sure they leave feeling their absolute best. I felt so confident and beautiful thanks to her work! If you’re looking for a stylist who is skilled, personable, and provides outstanding customer service, Christine is the one!

I will definitely be coming back for future events—thank you, Christine, for making me feel amazing!

Christine was very responsive and on it. During my first trial, I did not like my makeup because as a person who does not wear much makeup daily, it was a bit too much for me. Christine immediately scheduled a new artist and makeup trial, and the new look was exactly what I was looking for.

Honest and long review coming up! I'll obviously update this review once the actual wedding day comes and goes, but I had to write something to express how much I loved my bridal ...

trial with Christine & Linh. One thing to mention also, two of my friends had ALSO booked Team Bridal Beauty for their weddings last year. I was a bridesmaid for one of those weddings and actually had my hair done by Christine! I had no idea that they were the same HMU team until I inquired about availabilities. Such a fun coincidence and it felt meant to be! Back to the trial... First of all, Christine & Linh are efficient! They take their time and make you look like the best version of yourself but with an amazing efficiency so you don't feel like you're sitting in a chair for hours! Or maybe they're just so personable that the time just goes by super fast. I started off my bridal trial with my hair done by Christine. She already had my inspo photos that she had asked for before my appointment. She walked me through the process as I've never done anything like a bridal trial or really a big glam session before. She said she'd start off with my Hollywood glam waves and then move onto the next half up/half down style after Linh did my makeup. She was so meticulous and careful with each curl. She used enough product to ensure that my curls would not fall (I have very slippery hair that's never been dyed). Once it became time for her to brush the curls out, I got more and more excited. I honestly was shocked that my hair could look that awesome--LOL. The waves were so perfectly uniform. Every strand looked so shiny and well combed. Christine is SO good at what she does. I truly felt like a celebrity. We decided that we would go with this look right away. Thank you Christine! Then came Linh with the makeup. She started with making sure she picked a playlist that would vibe well with us. Let me just preface this by saying, I'm pretty particular with my makeup. I've done my makeup everyday more or less the same way for the last 10 years. I'm a creature of habit and I was a little nervous because people besides myself doing my makeup has always been tricky. Linh is AMAZING with finding your shade, making sure to check in with you as you go to make sure you're liking what you're seeing so far, and helping you figure out which look would look best on you. I didn't feel pressured one way or another. She was asking my opinion and giving me suggestions when I couldn't decide (I'm pretty indecisive). She was patient and took my suggestions. I'm really picky with my eyebrows and she totally got my vision. Thank you Linh! When I saw the final look, with the hair and makeup all done, I felt completely bridal. I didn't want to wipe off my makeup or touch my hair because it looked perfect. So excited for the wedding day. They're really easy to work with, respond to emails quickly, and are open to feedback. I'm so grateful to have found this team!

In all, I got beautiful hair and makeup for myself and three of my bridesmaids for a super good price. I would definitely recommend Team Bridal Beauty to any Bay Area brides looking to feel stunning on their big day!

My family and I were so pleased with the services provided by team bridal beauty. We had 3 wonderful women who did make-up and hair (Christine, Helena, and Aline). We could not be ...

more pleased with the way our hair and make up turned out for my brothers wedding. They were on time and got us ready just like an assembly line. Coming from LA and not having time to any trial runs for make up and hair, they went over and beyond our expectations. (All we did was show them a picture of how we wanted our hair/make-up and they made it look better than the picture!) if I could give them more stars I would!

Christine and her team were amazing! They did my hair and makeup for my wedding, as well as my mother's, mother-in-law's, and all 6 of my bridesmaids. My makeup was flawless, and m...

y hair looked better than it ever has. Christine had me send inspiration pictures for what I wanted all the hairstyles to look like, and they were spot on! I would highly recommend Christine and Team Bridal Beauty to anyone who is getting married, or having an event. I could not have been any happier with how it all turned out!

I cannot day enough about Christine and her team!! From start to finish the communication was great and Christine was extremely pleasant and easy to work with...not to mention pati...

ent. She did a trial for me and came to my home with the make up artist on her team in tow. The trial was complimentary because I ended up booking her for the wedding day, but it wasn’t a hard decision after chatting and having her try a couple of different styles on me. I also had my make up done by Kristine (I think that is her name!), and it was flawless. I had her tweak a few things here or there before the final product was what I was looking for. I wasn’t made to feel bad or weird for asking for changes. My hair was trickier. a few weeks later I was regretting my hairstyle choice we had decided on in my original trial(typical indecisive bride lol), and called Christine. We set another time for her to come out and re-do my trial. This was not free of charge but Christine proceeded to spend 3 hours with me on a Sunday doing, and re-doing my hair. Her dedication, patience, and over all positive attitude was so appreciated. Again, never once did I feel like I was putting her out. She truly loves what she’s doing, and goes above and beyond. It shows in the final product. I had 13 women who wanted hair and make up for the wedding, including myself. The entire process was smooth and everyone was done with plenty of time for touch up and photos before we had to get to the venue (minus one hiccup with an artist having trouble finding our air bnb, therefore showing up late, but it ended up working fine). Not to mention Christine’s pricing is extremely competitive. Highly recommend, you will not regret hiring team bridal beauty!!
