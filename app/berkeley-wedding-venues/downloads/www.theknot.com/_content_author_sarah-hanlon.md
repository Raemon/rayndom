Sarah is the Entertainment & Celebrity Editor for The Knot. A passionate storyteller at heart, she specializes in pop culture, celebrity wedding news, and wedding trends. She's also the voice behind The Knot's editorial newsletters.

Originally from Pennsylvania, Sarah currently resides in New York City. When she's not catching up on her favorite reality TV shows, she's probably reading a rom-com novel or scoping out the best bagel spot in Manhattan. 

## Experience

Sarah knew she wanted to be a journalist from an early age—she'd often take her mom's magazines from the mailbox and collect them in her room. (The movie _How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days_ also had a role in her aspirations.) She began her career in high school as a writer for the teen section of her local newspaper. Then, in college, she was the editor-in-chief of her school's chapter of Her Campus, an online magazine for college women. She also contributed to her school's newspaper, _The Hofstra Chronicle_ , and covered campus news and politics as a reporter on the weekly news show Hofstra Today. 

In 2017, Sarah joined TULA Skincare as an editorial and social media intern. On the team, Sarah helped grow the brand's presence by introducing a Pinterest strategy, facilitating influencer outreach and partnerships, organizing social media giveaways and creating branded editorial content. From there, Sarah joined NBC Universal as a digital editorial intern at Bravo TV. While there, she fulfilled her reality TV obsession by recapping _Housewives_ reunions, covering "Bravolebrity" news and curating weekly e-commerce style roundups inspired by the shows. After her year-long internship ended, she continued her work on the team as a freelance writer for the site's fashion vertical. Sarah's introduction to the wedding industry began when she joined The Knot Worldwide. 

## Education 

Sarah is a proud alumna of Hofstra University. She graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in journalism from the Lawrence Herbert School of Communication and a minor in writing studies.

## Important Questions From The Knot 

### Best advice for to-be-weds?

Forget the traditional "rules" you think you're supposed to follow. Your wedding day is all about you, so the most important thing is to make decisions that reflect who you are as a couple. That's the best way to make your day truly stand out. 

### What’s your all-time favorite wedding song?

"I Wanna Dance With Somebody" is hands down the best wedding song of all time. I'm pretty sure it's impossible to not sing along with this classic hit which is why you'll always find me in the middle of the dance floor when it comes on.

### Dream celebrity wedding guest?

My dream celebrity wedding guest is, without a doubt, Taylor Swift. And I'd love for her to perform "You Are In Love" (AKA one of her most underrated songs) for my first dance.

### Best wedding after party snack?

I can't think of a better way to end a wedding day than with plenty of french fries and an array of dipping sauces.
