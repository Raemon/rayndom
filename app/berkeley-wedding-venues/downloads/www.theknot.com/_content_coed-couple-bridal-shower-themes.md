Hosting a couple's shower (instead of the traditional bridal shower) is just one more way to modernize your wedding celebration. Whether you're planning your own party or hosting on behalf of the to-be-weds, there are plenty of couple's wedding shower ideas to choose from. You can think of these inclusive, coed parties as a way to bring loved ones from both sides together a few months before the wedding day. A coed [wedding shower](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-shower-vs-bridal-shower) can also help break the ice between members of your wedding party before they walk down the aisle together on the big day. Read on for a roundup of our favorite crowd-pleasing [couple's shower](https://www.theknot.com/content/couple-bridal-shower-basics) ideas and party themes below. Then, head to [The Knot Vendor Marketplace](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace) to find an event planner who can help bring your vision for the day to life.

## Couple's Shower Themes

While bridal showers tend to be a little more traditional, couples showers offer a chance to get more creative and plan a mini bash ahead of the wedding day. "A joint couples shower is a chance to have some fun and not rely on some of the stuffier themes that are common with the big day itself," says Keith Willard, owner of [Keith Willard Events](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/keith-willard-events-fort-lauderdale-fl-1041879) in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Think outside the box with a theme that reflects the couple's interests, whether it's something inspired by their favorite sports team, a hobby they share together or both of their family backgrounds. To help kickstart your creativity, we put together 10 wedding shower theme ideas for couples.

### "I Do" BBQ

!["I Do" BBQ couple shower idea](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/1e42398b-3d3d-4aa3-a374-5ee1753a8435~rs_768.h)

'Cue the celebration! Whether you host this coed bridal shower at an actual barbecue pit, next to your backyard grill or inside your kitchen in the event of inclement weather, BBQ food should be front and center (along with the marrying couple, of course). The menu is a cinch to plan: ribs, chicken, brisket or sausage, coleslaw and corn on the cob. And, if it's in the budget, you can even hire a country or bluegrass band to set the mood. BTW: ["I do" BBQ](https://www.theknot.com/content/i-do-bbq-engagement-party-ideas) would make a great theme for your engagement party or rehearsal dinner as well.

### Lucky in Love

You hit the jackpot finding your partner, now it's time to try your luck at some card games. Save the actual trip to Sin City for your bach party and instead host a Las Vegas themed couples shower at home. In terms of supplies, all you'll need is a few decks of cards and some poker chips. Of course, if you want to up the ante, it doesn't hurt to have a few cool prizes on hand. And if you like the idea of being able to enjoy more raucous poker nights with your newlywed buddies, gift them the [poker set they registered for](https://www.theknot.com/registry/store/products/poker-set?id=258592) .

### Last Swing Before the Ring

![Last swing before the ring couples shower theme](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/f183e95c-e117-4353-a397-64479d8b985f~rs_768.h)

Ready to par-tee? Step 1: Buy your friends the [golf goodies they registered for](https://www.theknot.com/registry/store/search?q=golf). Step 2: Get your crew together for a round of golf to celebrate your upcoming nuptials. You can host the event at your local country club, a driving range or even at a mini golf course. Whether you decide to play for fun or keep score we can guarantee your guests will love this coed wedding shower idea. 

### Find your kind of venue

From barns to ballrooms, discover reception venues that feel like you.

### Taco 'Bout Love

![Taco 'bout love couples shower theme](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/8d8da891-c4dc-4291-b3ea-6d9d8602e391~rs_768.h-cr_0.82.1229.1721)

_[Photo: Kate Elizabeth Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/kate-elizabeth-photography-spring-tx-1023466)_

Can't handle cooking all of the party food yourself? Skip the stress in the kitchen and hire a taco truck to cater the event instead. It's a fun couples bridal shower idea if the to-be-weds already have a favorite food truck—if you're planning on their behalf, ask friends and family for their food truck recommendations to surprise the couple. **Psst:** It's not a taco night without margaritas so be sure to have all the ingredients ready to go.

### That's Amore

![That's amore couples shower theme](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/d42ddaf9-cb71-4caa-8aa3-5b1472f9b7d2~rs_768.h)

Making homemade pizzas with all your favorite people by your side? Now that's amore! When it comes to couples wedding shower themes, you can't go wrong with a pizza night. It's easy, inexpensive and most of all, fun. (And seriously, who doesn't love pizza?) You can create a topping bar filled with veggies, meat and other unexpected add-ons. Have guests get creative while arranging their toppings, then vote on the best-looking pie at the end of the night. **Pro tip:** If the couple registered for a pizza oven, like the viral [Ooni pizza oven](https://www.theknot.com/registry/store/products/karu-12g-pizza-oven?id=239493), purchase it ahead of the event so it can be christened at the party. 

### Brews Before "I Do"

![Brews before I do couples shower theme](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/766ce7a6-0dd9-46e8-8b05-2f0f10fbec7f~rs_768.h-cr_0.41.1229.1680)

_[Photo: Jessica Crews Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/jessica-crews-photography-fredericksburg-va-589163)_

If you'd prefer to keep things casual, this couples shower theme is the way to go. You can head to your local brewery, or create your own at-home brewery by asking guests to bring a six-pack of their choosing to the event—the more unique the better! Spend the evening tasting new brews and toasting to the happy couple.

### Off to the Altar

![Off to the altar bridal shower theme](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/1945ad4f-161a-4a33-b5e0-db3d2cb7846b~rs_768.h)

_Design: Falak Khoja,__Photos: Getty, Stocksy_

…And you're off to the altar. Celebrate the occasion with a derby-inspired couple's bridal shower theme. Serve mint juleps, bourbon balls and other southern classics while guests place bets on various aspects of your upcoming wedding (ie: who will cry first and what will the first dance song be). _The dress code?_ Pastels and over-the-top hats, of course.

### Perfect Match

![Perfect match couples shower theme](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/84dc0cf3-f843-405c-9720-f7432a6155df~rs_768.h-cr_0.82.1229.1721)

Here's a couples shower theme idea you're sure to _love_ (pun intended). Go head-to-head against guests in an exciting game of tennis or pickleball to celebrate finding your perfect match. (Matching visors are an absolute must in our books.) After the game, enjoy cocktails and small bites inspired by the iconic menu at Wimbledon.

### Boots & Bubbly

![Boots and bubbly couples shower theme](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/fd241a94-1a1d-40a7-bdd5-61fafa334ec9~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1080.1440)

_[Photo: Ruét Photo](https://ruetphoto.com/)_

Every couple deserves one last rodeo before saying "I do," so grab your boots and get ready to host a Western themed coed shower. On the agenda for the night? Line dancing, country song karaoke and perhaps a ride on an inflatable mechanical bull. 

### Shuck Yeah, They're Getting Married

![Shuck yeah couples shower theme](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/6ff3fd1c-ad0c-43b9-a4c8-8e9bbf9be157~rs_768.h)

_Design: Falak Khoja,__Photos: Getty, Stocksy_

No matter where you're hosting your couple's shower, you can channel a laidback, coastal vibe by opting for an oyster shucking theme. Use seashells as your couple shower decorations (you can even serve the oysters on ice inside of a giant clam shell). Then, hire an expert to come and teach everyone how to shuck an oyster like a pro.

## Couple's Wedding Shower Ideas

Skip the traditional party where everyone sits in a circle and watches the couple open gifts—these fun couples [shower ideas](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-shower-ideas-we-love) are packed with activities to get guests mixing and mingling.

### Lawn Games

![Lawn games couples shower theme](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/271c2baf-86eb-4134-b0b1-d4edfc5a035d~rs_768.h-cr_0.180.1080.1620)

_[Photo: Amanda Megan Miller Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/amanda-megan-miller-photography-chicago-il-542104)_

Take your backyard barbeque to the next level with the help of some [wedding shower games](https://www.theknot.com/content/a-complete-guide-to-bridal-shower-games). Four-in-a-row, corn hole and bocce are just a few of the many crowd-pleasing options you could set out on the lawn.

### Bounce House

![Bounce house couples shower theme](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/befa540b-01a4-468f-8a62-d2f84c297aca~rs_768.h-cr_0.82.1229.1721)

_[Photo: ALLISON SULLIVAN: Personal. Natural. Storyteller.](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/allison-sullivan-personal-natural-storyteller-new-york-ny-955800)_

In our books, you're never too old for a bounce house. In fact, it's one of our favorite ideas for a couples shower. In addition to being so much fun, it also makes for really great photo-ops. There are even plenty of games that can be played inside the bounce house.

### Carnival Rides

![Carnival ride couple wedding shower theme](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/c02c3116-01ca-42b6-bd3b-f08020ffb752~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1009.1345)

_[Photo: Koby Brown Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/koby-brown-photography-galveston-tx-563650)_

If you're looking for a unique couples shower theme, consider hosting a carnival complete with rides, performers and games. You can decorate picnic tables with red-and-white checked tablecloths and wildflowers in mason jars. Then, hire a food truck or two (ideally, one that serves fried foods on a stick).

### Movies and Popcorn

![Movies and popcorn couple shower theme](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/a452b971-3cb4-465e-8432-5a957e8fb46f~rs_768.h-cr_0.82.1229.1721)

_[Photo: Ricky Rodriguez Photography](https://www.rickyrodriguezphoto.com/)_

Looking for [shower ideas on a budget](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-shower-ideas-on-a-budget)? Get your loved ones together for an at-home movie night and create a snack bar with popcorn, candy and other cinema staples. Pro tip: Rather than stressing over your movie selection, just do a double feature of each partner's favorite film.

### Photo Booth

![Photo booth couple shower theme](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/05f298fc-4ce7-4bc2-b364-35241638404e~rs_768.h-cr_0.72.1080.1512)

_[Photo: Rachel Marie Photographie](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/rachel-marie-photographie-minneapolis-mn-765523)_

One of the most quintessential wedding shower ideas for couples is, of course, a [photo booth](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/wedding-photo-booth-rentals). Not only is it so much fun to pick out props and pose with your besties, but once the photos are printed, they'll serve as the perfect keepsakes from the event. 

### Pet-Inspired Cocktails

![Pet-inspired cocktails at couple shower](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/fdeb7cfa-9551-4aa1-862c-0e68e17e1f3c~rs_768.h-cr_0.82.1229.1721)

_[Photo: Jodee Debes Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/jodee-friday-and-co-houston-tx-767591)_

If you love your roles as pet parents, we can't think of a cuter way to honor your furbabies than this. Create custom cocktail recipes inspired by and named after your pets—bonus points if you include photos or drawings of them on the bar display.

### Paint and Sip

![Paint and sip at wedding](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/79b2160a-c670-4645-bd20-429382bc2a90~rs_768.h-cr_493.0.3000.3342)

_[Photo: Annie Piland Photography](https://anniepiland.com/)_

Another fun "his and hers" shower idea is to host a paint and sip night either at a local studio, or at home. For a unique twist on the activity, you can have guests try to paint you and your partner and do a grand reveal at the end of the night.

### Boba Bar

![Boba bar at couples shower](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/db1952e7-1bdd-4079-aa33-a8fd5040160d~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1600.2133)

_[Photo: Sposto Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/sposto-photography-signal-hill-ca-620447)_

No couples shower is complete without a few sweet treat options. Sure, cake or cookies may be the first things to come to mind, but why not mix things up (literally) with a bubble tea bar? Trust us when we say your guests will be talking about it for years to come.

### Bingo

![Bingo at couples shower](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/0d11b249-c3ed-4bd7-9d12-04ed095c8aa0~rs_768.h-cr_0.82.1229.1721)

_[Photo: Liz Banfield Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/liz-banfield-photography-minneapolis-mn-306799)_

When it comes to couples shower game ideas, you can't go wrong with bingo. It's easy to play and everyone knows the rules! Encourage a little friendly competition by awarding [shower game prizes](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-shower-game-prizes) to the winner of each round.

### Charcuterie Table

![Charcuterie table at wedding](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/2ff8b74e-94e6-4593-b0bb-f4eb04fdf632~rs_768.h-cr_0.180.1080.1620)
