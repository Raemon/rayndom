These ladies were great! I used them for make-up AND hair for myself, my three bridesmaids, and my Mom. They were super helpful during the trail run before the wedding to help me ...

figure out my wedding day look. And it was such a treat to have them show up to my bridal suite the morning of the wedding. No rushing around to get to a salon or anything! I highly recommend them for any Sonoma County Bride!!

I have had Christy do my makeup for weddings I've been in and I knew I needed her to be the makeup artist for my wedding! She came all the way out to our location and made not only...

me and my bridesmaids feel like the most beautifully polished versions of ourselves, but as well, mother of the bride and flower girls. She is organized and prepared and knows exactly how to make the girls feel gorgeous! I never even wear foundation or mascara on a regular basis, makeup for me is foreign and scary. I completely trusted Christy and her vision, especially her knowledge of what photographed well. She was also helpful the day of answering wedding questions as she is well versed in the entire wedding process. I hope Christy can do my makeup any time I need to look my best!!!

Flaunt makeup artistry was recommended to me by a close friend. I used flaunt for my engagement photos, bachelorette party, and day of makeup. I had the most incredible experience....

Chrysti was so knowledgable, professional, and made me feel so comfortable. As a person who does their own makeup everyday, it can sometimes be nerve racking to let someone else be in charge. Chrysti knows the does and don'ts of photo makeup. If you are looking for professional makeup, go with flaunt and let them do what they do best. You will be so happy that you did.

I do not wear make up, like ever. So I was really nervous to have my makeup done, I was warned ahead of time that it would have to be really heavy and I probably would not be happy...

with it except in pictures. Well they were wrong! Flaunt Make up Artistry, more specifically Chrysti was brilliant. I had my make up done 3 times, and every time it looked absolutely amazing. It was not just the make up though, I really enjoyed working with Chrysti. She fit in perfectly on the day of my wedding and really made the whole getting ready process so easy. She listened to everything I asked and if she did something I did not like, she fixed it right away. She always made me feel important and well taken care of. These women are down to earth, they do not go over the top with make up and their prices are ridiculous.

Spending the morning of my wedding with the Flaunt girls was the perfect way to start my perfect day. They were so fun and still professional, really listening to what we wanted ba...

sed on the trial, the wedding feel, etc. They came to the hair salon to make it easy for us and blended right in with my friends and sisters, keeping us on schedule and in good spirits. They listened when I had colors I brought and wanted, and chose the right colors from their products to finish me up. They did makeup on everyone from age 5-65 and we all looked like ourselves at our best. Chrysti even helped pin boutonnieres on my groomsmen in a pinch! Now that's service.

My husband and renewed our vows, since we eloped the first time. I wanted the whole nine yards and had a large wedding party so all four of them were there we had SO MUCH FUN!!!! T...

hey were extremely sweet, so professional, and had great energy! There was some tension between some of the ladies in my wedding party and they helped keep spirits high, that alone helped SO MUCH! They were also very reasonably priced. I would refer these gals to ANYONE they helped make my day that much better!
