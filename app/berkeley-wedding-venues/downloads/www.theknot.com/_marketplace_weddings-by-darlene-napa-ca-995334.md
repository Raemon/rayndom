We used Weddings by Darlene for our wedding in Sonoma, CA as a day of wedding planner. Darlene, Jim, and Shalene were excellent! Darlene and Jim did a site visit a few weeks befo...

re the wedding and gave suggestions on various touches to include for the wedding. Shalene managed our wedding the day of and kept everything running smoothly and on time. She helped arrange the tables and set everything up how we wanted at the venue. She was amazing!

Working with Darlene and Jim was truly one of the best decisions we made for our wedding. From the very first conversation, they made us feel seen, heard, and completely at ease. T...

heir attention to detail, warmth, and genuine passion for what they do radiated through every step of the process. They didn’t just plan our wedding—they brought it to life. Every vision we had was thoughtfully executed and elevated in ways we never could have imagined. On the day of, Darlene and Jim created a calm, seamless environment that allowed us to be fully present, knowing that everything was in the most capable hands. Our wedding day was nothing short of magical, and so much of that is because of their tireless work behind the scenes. We are beyond grateful for their guidance, kindness, and the personal touch they brought to every moment. We truly can’t recommend them highly enough!

This is almost 1yr after our wedding (I know, so late for our vendor reviews 😬) but we liked our experience with our planners Darlene & Jim; however, things could’ve been better l...

eading up to the wedding. They’re such great people, love them a lot but I found myself doing a lot of the work…though we paid for partial planning (3 tiers: full planning, partial planning, and day-of). Led to a lot of stress, especially when due dates were approaching and I wasn’t getting feedback from planners - I know there were A LOT of weddings due to COVID and events getting rescheduled but we were paying for a service that we feel we didn’t get the full extent of. But for the positives, they’re VERY knowledgeable with the business and have a recommendation for just about anything you could need for your wedding (florists, djs, photobooths, furniture rentals, truly anything you could need) and our wedding day was fantastic and they did a great job pulling everything together and organizing everything in the end.

We had an excellent experience working with Darlene, Jim and Judy throughout the entire planning process. They were very helpful throughout each step of the process, organized and...

easy to communicate with. They created a timeline for us that was updated along the way and a great tool to keep everybody on the same page. They accounted for all of the little things that we would not think of. All three came to the venue a couple of months prior to the wedding to walk through everything and paint the picture for us. We worked with Judy for the rehearsal and the day-of. She kept everybody on schedule while remaining calm and collected. She handled every minor hiccup professionally and didn't stress us with the issues during the ceremony or reception. Everything went so smoothly and we've been told by countless guests about how perfectly organized and well planned everything was. My sister also used Darlene for her wedding and it was also perfect! Can't recommend them enough, very professional and organized!
