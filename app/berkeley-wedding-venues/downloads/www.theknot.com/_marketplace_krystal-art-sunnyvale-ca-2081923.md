nly 3 months away from my wedding. She scheduled a trial with me and I loved her work! Her prices were very reasonable as well. Krystal and Mai did hair and makeup for me (the bride), my stepmom, my mother-in-law, and my 5 bridesmaids, plus my husband’s hair. Krystal even did my eyebrows for me that day. Everyone’s turned out amazing - we were literally cheering with excitement as each person showed us their finished look! Both hair and makeup lasted the entire day (12+ hours), including lots of dancing at the reception. Krystal and Mai included touch-up kits as well in case we needed them. They did an incredible job finding us the right foundation colors (something that a few of us have had issues with in the past), and everyone’s makeup looked very natural while still being glam and sparkly. Krystal and Mai were both very sweet, and we all enjoyed working with them. I can’t recommend them enough!!

I wholeheartedly recommend Krystal for bridal hair and makeup services. Communication with her was consistently efficient and clear. She did an amazing job on my hair and makeup at...

my trial, and we were able to go over my makeup preferences and a couple of different hairstyles. Nine hours later, my hair and makeup still looked wedding-ready. She also gave me some helpful advice for taking better care of my skin. The morning of my wedding, Krystal and her associate traveled to my hotel to do hair and makeup for my sister, my mother, and myself. They were friendly and cheerful, despite our early 5:30 AM start time! Krystal had taken notes and photos from my trial and was able to immediately get to work on my hair and makeup, both of which turned out exactly as I had hoped for. My sister and mother both gave Krystal's associate very loose ideas of what they wanted their hair and makeup to look like, and both were delighted by their end results. My sister even felt that her hair and makeup looked better than they had on her own wedding day. Krystal's prices are more than fair, and worth every penny. She also has all of her prices listed on her website, so there are no surprises, which I definitely appreciated. I would not hesitate to hire her again.

Krystal is an amazingly talented artist. Beyond that, she is a sweet, fun, and joyful addition to any wedding planning team. We were in urgent need of a hair and makeup artist for...

our wedding: less than a week before the big day, we still hadn't booked anyone. For our wedding (with two brides), we definitely needed someone talented and special. The moment we got in touch with Krystal, we knew we had found the right person for the job. Krystal was warm, professional, and accommodating. She quickly made time for a trial for both of us, and we all had fun and enjoyed the experience of trying different styles. Krystal also provided us with products and tips to use in the lead up to the big day. We felt comfortable and cared for from the beginning. On our wedding day, Krystal brought two colleagues to help with our bridal party hair and makeup. Everyone was professional and punctual and followed the schedule Krystal had drawn up for us. Our family felt comfortable and we all had an awesome time getting ready together and making memories. Krystal's styling for me and my wife was absolutely breathtaking. She created natural looks that enhanced our features. We felt like we looked like ourselves, only more beautiful. The makeup was clean and light, and we both felt comfortable and looked great throughout the night of emotions and dancing. Both of our families commented repeatedly on how glowing we looked. We had so much fun getting ready with Krystal and her team! We genuinely enjoyed her and look forward to more opportunities to work with her in the future.
