Dani is not just a photographer she is a storyteller. From the engagement session to the wedding day, she made us feel completely at ease. She took the time to understand which mom...

ents mattered most to us and anticipated everything without us having to ask. On our wedding day, she quietly moved through the venue, capturing every laugh, tear, and glance with perfect timing. Every image in our gallery feels intentional. She noticed the little things that make weddings so special. The way my bouquet caught the morning light, the delicate smile of my grandmother, the excitement on my husband’s face as I walked down the aisle. Those moments might have gone unnoticed if Dani hadn’t been there. She also made the whole process easy. She helped coordinate timelines, worked seamlessly with our planner, and delivered our gallery in just 14 days. It is hard to put into words how much these photos mean to me. Every time I look through them, I feel like I am right back in that magical day.
