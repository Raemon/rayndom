ything so easy and clear. My makeup artist was Karla, and she was amazing. She has such extensive knowledge of makeup and skincare, which made me feel completely at ease. After my trial, I realized the look I initially wanted wasn't quite right for me. Karla listened carefully to my concerns, and on the wedding day, she absolutely nailed it--it was exactly what I had envisioned! I felt beautiful, and my makeup lasted perfectly all day and night. Karla also did most of my bridesmaids' and my mom's makeup, and they all looked stunning. Jessica did my hair, and she's also incredible at what she does. After the trial, we switched to a different style for the big day, and Jessica executed it flawlessly. She styled my bridesmaids' and my mom's hair beautifully as well. My mom was unsure of what style she wanted, and Jessica was so patient and creative. She worked with her, had her try a style for a bit, and then adjusted it to perfection during the final touch-ups. Plus, Jessica is so fun to chat with--she made the whole experience even more enjoyable! Overall, I highly recommend Lash Out Loud Beauty Bar and her team for any wedding or event. They're talented, professional, and just a joy to work with!

how I do it and to be honest, I usually don’t like getting my hair and makeup done. She really took the time to listen to my vision and incorporated my feedback perfectly. Her team was very professional and skilled. She was so calm and collected. They were even able to quickly replace a sick team member the morning of the wedding, which was a huge relief. My hair and makeup looked stunning all day long, and all the other girls in the bridal party were equally impressed. I highly recommend Mayra and her team for any bride!

The artists on the day were so pleasant and really were a calming influence on a stressful day which was perfect! They arrived on time, stuck to the schedule (if not came in a bit early). They also worked really well with the photographer who wanted certain shots. All in all very professional and the results were incredible!

Loved the natural look. The wedding makeup - honestly I don't know where to begin! We had 2 ceremonies - Hindu and Christian. She did such a brilliant job with my makeup on both days! I loved my look. She did a great job with my hair also for both ceremonies. Traditional South Indian hairstyle for my Hindu one and half up half down lovely hairstyle just like I wanted it for the Christian one. She also did hair and makeup for my bridesmaids and maid of honor. They looked like dolls! I am totally impressed with the professionalism and effort Mayra and her girls put in - if you have been reading this review, don't wait any further - just go ahead with Mayra! Don't stop to think at all. You will have the best experience you can imagine!

ne day before my wedding that I needed help on makeup for my mom and in-law. Without any hesitations, she replied to me that she could come early. I did not hire a planner on my wedding day. Mayra initiated to take the responsibilities and literately saved my day. It was a rainy day. She kept checking my makeup and making sure I looked good. She held the umbrella and carried a blanket for me while shooting outside in the rain. She even helped to fix one of the flower girls' hair. I cannot be more grateful that I chose Mayra and I will recommend her with all my heart!

During the trial she was very detailed and took lots of time to make sure that I was happy with the final look, and on the wedding day the whole team that came (we had a large bridal party, and Lash Out Loud Beauty Bar will provide more assistants to the main artist to make sure that you finish on time) was fantastic. What was important for me too was that everyone had very good hygiene standards when doing our makeup, so nobody was worried about cold sores or breaking out from contaminated product. Everyone's hair and makeup held up and we were done very efficiently. Pictures turned out great!! I'd definitely recommend Lash Out Loud Beauty Bar to anyone looking for a mobile hair/makeup service for their wedding party.

I was looking for with my hair and make-up, but they worked with me to make sure they captured my vision, but made it even better! For my hair, Mayra was patient and took her time to give me the perfect dramatic hollywood waves. Lluvia did an amazing job with my make-up and really worked with me to make sure I loved my make-up (which I rarely ever do when someone else does it). I didn't know I could look so good!!! And they are both great to talk to - if you are spending 4+ hours with your hair/makeup people on your trial and wedding day you want to enjoy that time together! HIGHLY recommend them both!!

Mayra offered me several trials, and we always had the cutest, sweetest text convos to set everything up. Working with Mayra , you get the pleasure of not only her cosmetic talents but her warmth, humor, kindness and most of all her spiritual gifts as well. After an hour or two with Mayra, you will leave her home, or wherever she's doing your makeup, feeling beautiful and enlightened, both inside and out. For so many reasons, Mayra is a rare find in this city, I couldn't recommend her more highly!

I feel so lucky that I was able to have Mayra and Lluvia with me for my wedding day to do makeup for myself and my seven bridesmaids on my wedding morning. Mayra was highly recomme...

nded to me for makeup and I can attest that she is completely amazing, kind, professional, and talented. My bridesmaids and myself were 100% happy with our makeup throughout the entire night of celebrating. We also loved being able to spend the morning with Mayra and Lluvia. They even had us done ahead of schedule and kept us stress-free. Thank you Mayra and Lluvia for making me feel like a beautiful bride! I couldn't have hoped for a experience. Xoxo.
