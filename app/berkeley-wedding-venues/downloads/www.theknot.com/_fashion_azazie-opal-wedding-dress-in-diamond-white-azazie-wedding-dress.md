Description

Have your guests in awe as you make your way down the aisle wearing our stretch crepe sheath gown, Opal. Her modern square neckline is complemented by her billowy balloon sleeves. The back is adorned with a row of buttons that go all the way down the knee length gown. At the bottom of the row there is a hidden zipper that allows you to choose the length of your center back slit. The cuffs also have fabric covered buttons to tie together the look.
