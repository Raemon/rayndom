If you've registered for wedding gifts at several different stores, you might be concerned when it comes time to share your registry with guests. How will you share lots of links? Will your guests be able to figure out where to shop? That's where wedding registry consolidation comes in.

Using [The Knot Registry](https://www.theknot.com/registry), you can easily bring all your separate registries into your wedding registry on The Knot and direct your guests to one site for all their shopping needs. Keep reading to learn how to streamline [multiple wedding registries](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-many-registries-should-you-have) into one central place that makes things simple for you and your guests, and ensures you receive the gifts you want most.

## Can You Consolidate Your Wedding Registries?

Yes! Many sites let you combine wedding registries into a single convenient location. Ideally, your registry should be a highly curated collection of items you want for your space. Often, that means maintaining registries at several stores, even if each registry only contains a few items. That's highly inconvenient when it comes to sharing your registry links with guests, who often prefer to shop at one or two places for wedding gifts. 

[READ MORE The Trendiest Things to Put on Your Wedding Registry ](https://www.theknot.com/content/new-wedding-registry-trends)

Additionally, services, experiences and even cash or gift cards are becoming increasingly popular [registry gifts](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-many-gifts-to-register-for). Consider Airbnb or Expedia gift cards, Tinggly experience gifts or a lavish couples' massage for your honeymoon. Registering for these items could make things even more complicated before wedding registry consolidation became possible. Creating a [universal registry](https://www.theknot.com/content/the-knot-universal-registry) on The Knot allows you to keep all of your registry items in one convenient location.

## Benefits of Consolidating Your Wedding Registries

In a word, the biggest benefit of having a combined wedding registry is convenience! Having everything in one place makes it easier for your guests to shop for that perfect gift and easier for you to manage and keep track of your registry. Still not convinced you should combine wedding registries? We've listed some additional benefits below.

### Register at Several Different Places

If a particular store has one or two items you can't live without but not enough for a traditional wedding registry, a wedding registry that combines stores is a perfect option. 

### Combine Gifts With Services, Gift Cards and Experiences 

Hoping to stock your kitchen _and_ score a weekend getaway in the Bahamas, courtesy of your wedding guests? It's totally possible with a combined wedding registry.

### Manage Your Registry in One Easy Step

The Knot Registry updates in real time when a guest makes a purchase, which allows you to keep track of those all-important thank-you notes (and even get an early jump on them!). What's more, you can add or remove items as guests begin making purchases, and guests can even update your registry to include an item they've purchased from a store that's not even on your registry!

### Avoid Duplicate Gifts

In the past, registering at a bunch of different stores could increase the likelihood of receiving the same gift more than once. But wedding registry consolidation cuts down on the chances of an awkward moment at your wedding shower. 

### Share a Single URL

When you combine wedding registries on a site like The Knot, you can then [share your registry](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-to-let-guests-know-where-you-registered) with your guests using a single URL. This keeps your invitations and wedding website clean and simple to read. 

## How to Consolidate Your Wedding Registries

When you set up a universal wedding registry like The Knot, it's super simple to combine registries. When you arrive on The Knot's registry page, you'll have three different ways to [add gifts to your registry](https://www.theknot.com/registry/add-store-registries). We'll walk you through each below. 

### 1\. Add Gifts From the Site

[The Knot Registry Store](https://www.theknot.com/content/the-knot-registry-placing-an-order) features hundreds of popular registry items to browse and add to your registry with just the touch of a button. You'll find everything from kitchen essentials to elevated home goods and unique items from popular brands like KitchenAid and Le Creuset. 

### 2\. Sync Gifts From Partner Sites

Choose gifts from any one of The Knot's featured partners like Target, Amazon and Anthropologie for a seamless addition to your wedding registry. This feature allows you to browse gifts and create a store registry without leaving The Knot's website. 

### 3\. Add Anything From Anywhere

If your desired store or item isn't featured anywhere else on The Knot, you can _still_ add it to your registry following these simple steps: 

  * Find your bookmark bar. If it's not visible, select "View" and navigate to "Show Bookmarks Sidebar" (or similar).
  * Drag the pink "Add to The Knot" browser bar to your bookmarks list. 
  * Go to your desired store's website. 
  * Click the item you'd like to register for. 
  * You'll be prompted to log in to The Knot if you're not yet logged in.
  * The item will automatically be added to your registry.



Once your big day has passed, you'll be able to take advantage of a 20% [registry completion discount](https://www.theknot.com/content/registry-completion-discount) courtesy of The Knot. It's a great way to save a chunk of change on the things you didn't receive but still really want to purchase.
