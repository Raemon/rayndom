There's no specific formula for how to choose a wedding band (beyond the fact that it should complement your engagement ring, if you have one). There's no one metal, amount of stones or style rules to follow. The wedding band should be as personal as your relationship—and in fact, it's something couples usually buy together (whether they opt for matching rings or not). 

[READ MORE Which Wedding Ring to Pair With Your Engagement Ring ](https://www.theknot.com/content/rings-for-diamond-shapes)

"More often than not, couples choose the engagement ring first, rather than at the same time as the band," says Sophie Thoerner, the creative director and cofounder of [Vice Versa](https://viceversajewelry.com/). "Most couples enjoy basking in the engagement bliss for a while before thinking about wedding bands."

When it is time to [buy the wedding band](https://www.theknot.com/content/who-pays-for-grooms-wedding-ring), how to choose a wedding ring style comes down to following your heart, doing what feels personal, and working with a jeweler you trust (you can search [The Knot Vendor Marketplace](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/jewelers) to find a jeweler near you). Here, Thoerner and [LVII Fine Jewelry Makers](https://lvii.com/) owner Lauren Rubert offer a few other tips for finding a wedding ring that will last as long as your love. 

[READ MORE Which Wedding Ring to Pair With Your Engagement Ring ](https://www.theknot.com/content/rings-for-diamond-shapes)

## Do Your Research

"I always suggest couples begin their search using Pinterest and Instagram so they can get an idea of some styles that they are drawn to," Rubert says. Thoerner agrees that nothing beats a Pinterest deep dive, but whether it's online or in-person, "the more you expose yourself to, the better," she says. "We always encourage couples to pop into jewelry stores, whether you're running errands or visiting a new neighborhood, because it gives you a real sense of what's out there." The main point? Don't settle or rush your decision. Take your time to explore a wide variety of options.

## Consider Your Lifestyle

"If you are planning on wearing your wedding ring daily, then you should definitely choose one that fits your life and not the other way around," Rubert says. Prioritize comfort, not just in the way the ring physically feels on your finger, but also in terms of whether you'll have to remove it often or work around it so it doesn't catch on things. "Consider your activity level, how you treat your jewelry—no shame! Some people, like us, wear theirs into the ground—how hard you are on your hands, and even your career," Thoerner says. "For example, a nurse might struggle with a super diamond-y band that's always catching on gloves. Your lifestyle should guide your choice."

A few specific examples? "If you work with tools, gloves, heavy equipment or machinery, you may want to consider something more solid; if you prefer stones, then go with a bezel setting over pave," Rubert suggests. "If you are active, perhaps go with platinum or 14k gold for strength, and choose a lower setting that won't catch. On the contrary, if you have a desk job or one that is more relaxed, you can choose more delicate designs, such as a pave diamond band or single prong eternity band, perhaps set in 18k gold."

## Connect With a Jeweler

There are myriad wedding bands to purchase online, but since this story is about finding a piece you're guaranteed to love _forever_ , we recommend working with a jeweler (even if you do so virtually!) rather than making a blind purchase. "Buying online can be tricky if you don't find the right jeweler, so do your homework," Rubert says. "Check reviews, talk directly with the designers and look through their social media to get a feel for the quality of their work."

## Set a Budget

Just as there's no one rule on how to pick a wedding ring, there's no rule on what to spend on one, either. "An engagement ring is deeply symbolic, and while it is wonderful to sacrifice a little for something so beautiful and meaningful, it should never put you in a financial hole," Rubert says. The good news? There are a multitude of options these days that make quality bands more accessible. Consider incorporating lab-grown diamonds over natural, or opting for a pave band rather than an eternity band. The [wedding band](https://www.theknot.com/content/unisex-wedding-bands) metal matters, too: 14k gold is less expensive (and actually, more durable) than 18k gold, for instance. "It is important to stay comfortable and realistic," Rubert says. "At the end of the day, what matters most is that you have a beautiful engagement ring that feels special and genuine to your love story."

## Try Them on in Real Life 

"This step is beyond important," Thoerner says. "Everyone's fingers are different, and certain stone shapes look better on some hands than others. We always recommend at least trying on different shapes and sizes, even if you ultimately buy online. That way, you can know things like, 'Oh, an elongated shape flatters my hand,' or 'wow, a three-carat looks absurd on me.'" Trying on in person is also crucial if you plan to [pair your band with an engagement ring](https://www.theknot.com/content/rings-for-diamond-shapes). Picking a wedding band is more seamless when you see how it will sit against the engagement ring, especially if you want a flush look. 

## Consider Trends—Then Forget Them

"Designing for the long run is important," Rubert says, "but timeless isn't a bad thing or meant to be boring." Choosing a wedding band that holds its value and remains in style guarantees you'll love it forever. That being said, you can always have more than one band; consider creating a [wedding ring stack](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-jewelry-stacks). "I think it's sentimental to keep the original band that you exchanged vows with forever, just as promised on that special day," Rubert says. "But you can always add more fun and trendy designs to swap out for your main band from time to time. There is no rule that says you should only have one option for each day and occasion."

## Modify the Fit 

Once you've found a band you love, make sure it is easy and comfortable to wear; most jewelers can actually customize the fit of a ring. "Opt for a comfort-fit interior band, which is tailored to your band width, in order to ensure the most comfortable fit," Rubert says. Comfort-fit bands glide on smoothly. 

## Make It Personal 

"Choose a style that reflects your personality, rather than what's trending or what you think you 'should' get," Thoerner says. "Your rings are about _you two_ , not anyone else. Have fun with it and get creative; incorporate something meaningful and symbolic about your relationship." Whether it's a hidden birthstone of the month you met, a certain number of stones for how many years you've been together, or a [mixed metal](https://www.theknot.com/content/mixing-wedding-ring-metals) band representing the blending of lives, make the wedding band your own. Even if you ultimately buy an existing style rather than a custom piece, you can personalize it with an engraving.

## Follow Your Heart 

"With all [the above] said, my main philosophy is simple: Buy what you love," Rubert says. "Choose the ring your heart has always wanted and just wear it when it's appropriate." If your lifestyle calls for something sturdier, but your heart is set on dainty, do it! "You can always have two—one for work and one for play."
