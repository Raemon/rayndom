## Frequently asked questions

Get answers to common wedding registry questions below or [visit our Help Center](https://helpcenter.theknot.com/hc/en-us).

### How does The Knot pull every wedding gift registry into one list?

We make it super simple for you to see, manage and share all of your wedding registries in a single place. Not to mention, in addition to [The Knot Registry Store](/registry/store), we've exclusively teamed up with retailers like Amazon, Crate & Barrel and Target. This means we can work behind the scenes to sync up with these partners so your wedding registry is always up to dateâand your cash funds and experiences appear alongside your retailer gifts.

### Can I change the way my wedding registry looks to guests?

If you want to see what your wedding registry will look like to your guests, go to "Manage Registry" or "View as Guest" in your account on The Knot. This takes you to the exact same view your guests will see when they look at your registry. You can also add quick notes to each gift to make communicating with your guests a breeze. You can even tag a registry gift as "Our Top Choice." And when you do, it'll add a badge so people know you really want it.

### What if I want to register for cash funds, experiences, sport tickets, etc.?

We've got all that! Tons of couples register for things they might not need (but really, really want) like a honeymoon, down payment for a future home or even date nights to keep the spark alive after the 'I dos' are done. Whatever your thing is, we have it. So take a peek and [start registering for experiences](/registry/store/categories/experiences/experiences) or [set up a cash fund](/registry/newlywed-fund-cash-wedding-registry) today.

### How do I set up my cash fund?

It's just three simple steps to set up a cash fund on your wedding registry on The Knot!  
Step 1: Choose from our list of popular wedding funds or create your own.  
Step 2: Give the fund a name, add the amount requested, write a short message for guests, then hit save.  
Step 3: Let us know where your cash should go by providing your banking details. After that, your cash registry is complete.

### How do I track my wedding registry?

Start adding products and we'll show you how many gifts are in your registry, the number already purchased and the amount remaining. You can even head over to the "Track Gifts" tab to get Purchased by, Gift Purchased, Order Status and Date Purchased information. Want to see the list in a different format? Hit the "Download List" button.

### Can I share my wedding registry?

Of course! Just create a [Wedding Website](/gs/wedding-websites) on The Knot and use your personal URL (the same one on your save-the-dates and invites) to share with friends and family. This helps guests track all your details, check registry requests and even update RSVPs.
