About this vendor

We craft intimate, natural compositions using florals sourced from local wine-country growers or hand-select from San Francisco’s bustling flower market. My style is rooted in classic, organic design, and chased down with something a little contemporary and unexpected. Think, rich botanical blends fused with textural elements like thistles, succulents and berries. With your vision and my craft, we’ll create truly unforgettable floral designs. From concept and planning to production and staging, you’ll find this process to be a deeply personalized experience. It starts with a consultation. We’ll talk vision, venues, styles and themes. And, once we’ve put our ideas on the table, I’ll draw up a proposal led by stunning visuals so you can get a taste of what’s to come. When the design is agreed, I’ll start bringing your vision to life. I work alongside the most talented creators and artisans in California’s beautiful wine country to produce that high-end botanical vibe you’re after. And to make sure everything’s just right on the day, I source and build props, hand-select linens, fabricate bespoke elements, and manage contractors.

Aimee was absolutely incredible as a florist. I garden and cared a lot about my flowers- and in particular wanted something that felt organic, lush and elegant and wanted the flowe...

rs honestly to stand out and be unique in terms of l type and color palette. Aimee was so amazing in helping me create that palette and intuitively understanding the vision I wanted to create. It was absolutely perfect, out of a dream. She somehow managed to incision what I wanted without me even knowing exactly what I wanted- she is so creative and artistic and really did such an incredible job creating the elegant but unexpected feeling I wanted my flowers to have. Flowers really do create the vibe of a wedding and Aimee simply knocked it out of the park. She was very easy to communicate with, funny, professional, and just an incredible floral artist. Meeting her with honestly an inspiration. It's honestly rare to meet a person with such an intuitive and powerful mastery of her craft. I loved working with her and was honestly blown away by her work.

We originally hired Aimee as our florist for a June 2020 event, which was ultimately postponed to August 2021. Aimee ended up doing a bouquet for just me for our August 2020 minimo...

ny and we just got back from our bigger celebrations in Sonoma where Aimee executed our floral visions perfectly. Throughout our years (!) of planning this event, we discussed a few different options for ceremony florals, budget, etc. and Aimee was so prescriptive and helpful throughout the process. And ultimately the florals designed and delivered for our big day were flawless. The colors and textures were perfect and everything we had discussed. We received so many compliments from our friends and family. We cannot recommend Aimee enough for event florals in wine country and beyond. She's amazing to work with, is such a fun person to chat and plan with, and does an absolutely beautiful job.

Aimee is amazing to work with. I found her initially by her association with our venue and other vendors and loved what I saw in her gallery / on social media. We have her booked f...

or our bigger (postponed) 2021 wedding but I worked with her to design my bridal bouquet for our "minimony" this summer and she totally nailed it. Not to mention she has awesome energy and enthusiasm and she will absolutely work with you on your vision but will also offer ideas, expertise, and advice based on her experience. Happy to have worked with her so far and excited to see everything come together next year!

Aimee is a floral genius. I had only a vague idea of what I wanted for our wedding florals, and Aimee ran with those ideas to create the most beautiful, unique final product. I tru...

Aimee's flowers elevated our event from beautiful to spectacular. I was so luck to have been able to book her. She not only understood the look we were asking for to a T, but also ...

was so generous with how many flowers she included the day of the wedding. My bouquet was stunning. And, she was able to provide off-season flowers, which is not easy and never guaranteed!! Highly recommend.

I love flowers, so having the right flowers at my wedding was very important to me. From my first meeting with Aimee, I knew she was going to be a fun and creative vendor to work w...

ith. She has so much energy and passion and was so excited about my color palette and my vision for the day. Aimee was very responsive and patient in explaining all the different types of flowers, so I could tell her what I liked and absolutely didn't want. She captured the balance of flowers to greenery and pops of color that I was looking for. I loved the eclectic, yet cohesive, mix of vases she chose for the center pieces at the reception. All of the boutonnieres were slightly different, which the groomsmen were pleased about. The bridesmaid bouquets had the right amount of color to stand out from their dresses. There was a swing at our venue, which she decorated. People loved taking pictures with it. Thank you for making my day so beautiful, Aimee!

We had the best experience working with Aimee. Early on, we were a little fish-out-of-water with wedding planning, and Aimee was super helpful and creative with guiding us through...

some of the details that we hadn't considered. After our plan was made, she listened and really made sure that the core floral designs matched my ideas. I didn't put down my bouquet the entire night, and all the arrangements were beyond beautiful. Aimee is relaxed, professional, approachable and an absolute pleasure to work with. Be sure to add her to your dream team.
