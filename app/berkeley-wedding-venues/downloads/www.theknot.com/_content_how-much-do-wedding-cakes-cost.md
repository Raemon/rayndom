## Wedding Cake Cost Factors 

While the average is good to know, you're probably wondering, "How much will a wedding cake cost specifically for me?" Before you finalize what percentage of your [wedding budget](https://www.theknot.com/wedding-budget) will go toward cake, it's important to understand all the factors that affect cost. 

![Average Wedding Cake Cost Factors](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/ed9747cd-5767-4891-8f7e-5754203801ea~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1500.1500)

### Number of Wedding Cake Slices 

Whether you prefer vanilla sponge, red velvet, raspberry filling or a combination of flavors, wedding cake is generally priced by the slice and most bakeries have a minimum price for custom orders and/or deliveries. Furthermore, the average price of a wedding cake can vary a lot per slice. There are a multitude of factors at play, so there's no one-size-fits-all number.

The bigger the cake, the more materials and ingredients that are needed to make it, which is reflected in the total cost. The biggest factor that affects the cost of a wedding cake? The number of guests you'll need to serve. For example, the average wedding cake cost for 200 guests will be much higher than the average cost of a wedding cake for 100 guests.

### Find your kind of venue

From barns to ballrooms, discover reception venues that feel like you.

A typical 8-inch round cake (imagine a birthday cake you'd find at the grocery store) serves about 15 people. In 2024, the [average number of wedding guests](https://www.theknot.com/content/average-wedding-guest-list-size) was 116, which means you'll need a multi-tiered wedding cake if your guest count is similar, assuming that each guest has one slice of cake. The more guests you're inviting = the more you'll spend on cake. Check out our breakdown of the average cost of a wedding cake by number of guests below:

  * 101+ guests: $631

  * 51-100 guests: $487

  * 1-50 guests: $315




### Labor to Make the Wedding Cake

And when you're wondering how much should a wedding cake cost, remember this: You're not only paying for a product, but also a service—you're paying for the cake designer's talents, time and labor, as well as cake storage and a delivery fee. The [talented wedding pros](https://www.theknot.com/content/ones-to-watch) you hire deserve to be compensated fairly for their hard work. 

### Wedding Cake Decoration

Wedding cakes aren't your everyday desserts (seriously, just check out these amazing [wedding cake ideas](https://www.theknot.com/content/amazing-wedding-cakes) and you'll see what we mean). They're elaborately decorated and constructed in ways that require special kitchen equipment and skills, so it's no surprise that their base cost is generally higher than the average party cake.

Along with the size of the cake, many [wedding cake decorating techniques](https://www.theknot.com/content/a-glossary-of-wedding-cake-terms) will also increase the overall price. In general, buttercream frosting costs slightly less, while fondant will yield a higher price tag. Details like handmade sugar flowers, intricate piping, edible gold leaf and other embellishments will also add to the total cost. 

### Specialty Flavors

Have a unique palate in mind for your cake? Certain [wedding cake flavors](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-cake-flavors) and fillings impact the cost too, especially if your baker is making something more time-intensive, such as a homemade fruit compote or a liquor-infused sponge.

### Simple Sheet Cakes 

If you're looking for a cost-cutting option, [wedding sheet cakes](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-sheet-cake) are a growing (and affordable!) trend. You could also ask your baker about downsizing to a small wedding cake and consider supplementing with other desserts like cookies or cupcakes instead. Dessert tables are a popular addition nowadays, with half of couples opting for one in 2024. If you have a guest list of 300, order a cake for 150 people and serve it in half-slices—some guests will likely leave slices half-eaten on the table anyway. 

In 2024, 71% of couples incorporated [the cake cutting tradition](https://www.theknot.com/content/cutting-the-cake) into their weddings. If the main reason you want to serve cake at the reception is for the cake cutting photo op, another alternative is to order a single-tier cutting cake that's decorated specifically for that moment. Your baker can provide undecorated cakes to keep in the back until it's time to serve dessert—they'll taste just as yummy but will help you cut down on total cost, especially if you're hosting several hundred guests.

### Cake Accessories 

Finally, don't forget to consider decorative accents when totaling how much wedding cakes usually cost. Items like [cake cutting sets](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-cake-knives-and-servers-youll-love), cake toppers and [wedding cake stands](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-cake-stands) are small but important details when it comes to displaying and serving the cake. If you don't want to buy your own, ask your venue, cake baker or catering company about their rental options.

## Wedding Cake Price Quotes

Once you have an idea of what you want for your cake, it's time to start researching potential bakeries and gathering quotes for your wedding cake. [The Knot Vendor Marketplace](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/wedding-cake-bakeries) is a great place to start your search. Not only can you search by location, but you can also filter based on dietary needs and general price range to find the best fit. Once you've found a few and started reaching out for quotes, consult this [list of questions for bakers](https://www.theknot.com/content/questions-to-ask-wedding-cake-bakers) to ensure you've covered your bases before you sign on the dotted line. 

## How Have Wedding Cake Costs Changed Over the Years?

So, why are wedding cakes so expensive? Wedding cake rates have remained steady the past couple of years, but was up almost 6% from the average cost in 2022, which was $510. It's safe to say that this wedding cake pricing could be [tied to inflation](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-inflation), which the wedding industry hasn't been immune to. Average wedding cake prices have fluctuated over the years, and are currently similar to prices in 2017 and 2018, when the normal wedding cake price was $550.
