Happy people, happy planet. This is my main focus at Paige Events. After witnessing first hand the massive amounts of waste produced at many of these large scale events I decided to create a company that respects the earth the way I respect every one of my clients. I have experience in weddings of all sizes and cultures and love every minute of the planning process! Elegant, classy, friendly and functional with attention to detail every step of the way. I go above and beyond to make sure all in attendance leave with ear to ear grins and memories that will last a lifetime.

How to sum up working with the fabulous Paige Fox for our wedding? It was one of the very best decisions we made. Paige DID so much for us - planning, organizing, directing, puttin...

g out fires, coming up with ideas, keeping the schedule - and she did it all with skill and flair. But what is most wonderful about working with Paige is her way of being. She is enthusiastic, loving, and fun. She has a calmness and ease about her that make the most stressful wedding decisions and strategizing feel like coffee with a friend. Working with Paige, you are aware, on a deep level, that she has everything under control. Beneath her cool vibes and easy delight, there is a well of profound organization and practicality. She kept us on schedule, with patience for all the emails we forgot to respond to and the tasks that kept falling off our to-do lists. When things got overwhelming, she picked up all the slack. She had great ideas and hyped us up when we brought our own to the meetings, encouraging us to make the wedding exactly what we had hoped for. She met with us as frequently as we wanted. Paige supported us as a queer couple by making sure all the vendors were affirming and supportive. She even found us a mime, because that was all I wanted in the world for my wedding day! Because we were getting married at my parents’ house in Santa Cruz, there were a lot of decisions to make and unique situations to navigate, from choosing where to eat dinner (where would all the tables fit? Where could the caterers set up?) to figuring out bathrooms and shuttles, placing the bars, and dealing with music in multiple areas. Paige managed this decision making process the whole way through, thoughtfully and in collaboration with my mother, who had strong feelings and important concerns that Paige always took into account. Paige’s design for the event worked very smoothly and was praised by many of our guests! When the wedding day came, we didn’t have to worry for a moment when the rental trucks were too big to get up the hill to the venue - Paige had it under control. We didn’t have to direct the florist or manage the caterers - Paige was right there. Her recommendations for vendors performed beautifully and our wedding day was expertly executed. Plus, she looked amazing in that hat! Paige had been the planner for my sister’s wedding as well, and also done an incredible job. To see her repeat the feat, and make our event unique and different (even in the same venue!) was astounding. My wife and I could not recommend Paige enough. She is beyond worth what she charges and will be the perfect lead for your wedding planning team. Don’t hesitate - just book.

y short engagement with 4/5 months to plan. I really needed someone to help locate and vet vendors and serve as a day of event coordinator. Paige and her team did an amazing job! She is known and respected by quality vendors (ie flowers, transportation, photography, etc.) which made me feel confident with whom we hired. This also made it easy to communicate and resolve any issues in a timely fashion. Paige also helped with the many smaller details from picking up printed materials at FedEx to giving advice on selections at the reception venue. I valued her opinion. She was always easily accessible via phone, text or email. On top of all that, Paige has a wonderful personality and was a pleasure to work with. I would 100% recommend Paige Fox to anyone needing event planning services.

e and beyond to help me plan the most perfect wedding weekend. They are incredibly organized, kind, and helpful throughout the entire process. They always made sure my opinions were heard and offered thoughtful options that perfectly matched my vision. My wedding had 300 guests, and even with that many people, the day felt completely seamless. I’m someone who usually worries about timelines, but I didn’t have to think twice about where I needed to be or what was happening next — they were always two steps ahead, anticipating every detail. Their vendor recommendations were spot-on, and every Zoom call with the team was a joy. They genuinely listened, made me feel heard, and always left me laughing by the end of each meeting. As organized as I am, I truly don’t think my wedding would have come together anywhere near as perfectly without them. Paige Events is an amazing team, and I can’t recommend them enough to anyone looking for planners they can truly trust to make their wedding dreams come to life.

team is one I rely on heavily as a venue, they curated amazing vendors as part of the extended team. I found Paige (there are two of them; I worked with the Paige who is not the owner, but another planner on the team) to be fun to work with, accommodating, and very thorough. On the day of the wedding, EVERYTHING went off without a hitch. When you're thinking of wedding planning and all the 'what ifs, ' THIS is the outcome you are looking for. A caring team of vendors to support each stint of the timeline for the day, while accounting for any possibilities. The couple was cared for, supported, and celebrated. I have seen many, many events here at the Los Altos History Museum, and I can tell you that this event was one of the ones that was the most expertly managed. If you are looking for a wedding planner, you can feel more than confident that you are in good hands with the Paige Events team.

as a lifesaver when it came to finding vendors who fit our budget AND our style for our Bernardus Lodge wedding. Whenever we felt overwhelmed, she'd jump in with guidance that always pointed us in the right direction. We planned virtually the entire wedding from across the country, and Paige made planning feel so manageable. Day-of, she was an absolute rockstar. She had every detail under control, kept all our vendors in sync, and even made sure we actually sat down to eat—something we definitely would have forgotten to do! Several of our vendors told us how much they loved working with her. Oh, and a fun bonus: we discovered we're both UCLA alums (go Bruins!), which made the whole experience so much more special. We simply don't think we could have pulled off our wedding weekend without Paige. If you're looking for a planner who's talented, organized, genuinely kind, and truly invested in your day, stop looking—you've found her.

When we were initially searching for wedding planners, it was immediately clear to us that the team at Paige Events stood head and shoulders above anyone else we interviewed. From ...

the moment we started working with Paige A for partial planning for our wedding, we were given all the tools and support we needed to plan and execute the most amazing wedding weekend. Paige A does an amazing job managing vendors (multiple of them came up to us after the wedding to tell us how much they liked working with her, and how great of a communicator she was) and ensuring that you can really relax and enjoy your wedding rather than worrying about logistical details. Our wedding had the additional challenge of being in an area with no cell reception (Big Sur) and Paige A did an amazing job managing logistics in this challenging environment, including arranging shuttles to transport 100 people for multiple events. It’s clear to see that Paige A is great at her job and that she also enjoys the process. If you’re looking for someone to help execute your wedding vision, look no further!

As well, I would send her the most random ideas, or barely any idea to see if it was possible, and she helped me bring my vision to life! Always offering support and guidance. Day of, I couldn’t have asked for a better counterpart, as we didn’t have to worry about anything! Paige had the schedule planned to a T, which let us fully be in the moment and enjoy every minute. She is the best person to have around on the wedding day, with her calm demeanor and bubbly personality. We also loved working with her other counterpart (Paige :)) throughout the day, as she was so organized and fun to be around at every step of the day.

If you’re looking for a wedding planner - your search is over. Hiring Paige was one of the best decisions of our entire wedding, and I promise you’ll be impressed by her work too. ...

We hired Paige about a year and a half before our wedding date, and we had absolutely no idea where to start. Throughout the entire process, Paige was patient with our questions, enthusiastic to help us achieve our goals and our outlandish ideas (whilst also helping us keep realistic on what was possible) and always went the extra mile to ensure the process was as smooth as possible for us. Paige managed all of the vendor communications for us, which was a massive help whilst we juggled our full-time jobs and other commitments. Reflecting on the experience now, there is no way we could have found our vendors (who were absolutely phenomenal and largely sourced and recommended by Paige’s expertise) and managed the communication with them half as well as she did for us. She kept the entire wedding planning progressing, helped us work through difficult challenges as they arose, and became our number one confidant and trusted friend throughout the process. On the wedding day itself, Paige was incredible. She was like a blur being everywhere at once, making sure guests, vendors and ourselves were properly cared for throughout the day (she brought us food and drinks, learned how to weave our table decorations (literally because I saw it on Pinterest), fluffed my train… she literally did it all!!). There was absolutely nothing we had to worry about or “sort” on the day as her team had everything completely in hand. She was incredibly professional and continued to go above and beyond for us, and we never once saw her without a beaming smile. It’s clear that Paige loves her job, and she invests every ounce of passion into ensuring her clients weddings are world class. Paige is the most down-to-earth, bubbly and supportive wedding planners we could have ever have hoped for. I am SO grateful for all of the wisdom, time and passion and patience she shared with us. I’m sure there’s hundreds of more testimonies just like ours, and I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend her to anyone. If we ever planned our wedding again, she would be a non-negotiable part of our day ❤️

Their responsiveness allowed us to plan our wedding in a short 6 months and they executed every detail flawlessly, found us the best vendors and communicated directly witih them on our behalf to make sure we were getting the best care. The actual day of our wedding wouldn't have been possible without Paige. When our caterers were working slowly or forgot things, Paige took it upon herself to serve our guests, make us late night pizza and ensure that everyone was having a good time. We wish we could get married again so that we can work with Paige(s) again and could not recommend them more to make a daunting process feel easy.

ily worked with throughout the process and she was absolutely phenomenal. So detail oriented, highly organized, excellent knowledge of the industry and local vendors, quick response time, and always ready for the next step. Paige is the definition of "Girl Boss" and was exactly who we needed to pull off organizing our 115 person destination wedding. We are so grateful for the kindness, generosity, and honesty that they both shared with us during such a stressful process. Our wedding day could not have been more perfect and we owe it all to Paige Events!

We don't have enough words to recommend Paige Events - from the very first phone call we knew that we had found the women we needed to help us plan the perfect wedding! Paige was ...

an absolute dream to work with - she helped us find the perfect vendors; create a vision and execute the most beautiful wedding. Each detail was perfectly executed and overseen by Paige the day and night of the wedding - she did not miss a single detail! Paige was incredibly helpful throughout and I almost think planned this wedding as if she were planning it for a family member - there was that level of care and love in each detail. My daughter and I will truly miss working with Paige and hope that our relationship will continue beyond the wedding day. You will not be sorry if you hire Paige Events - you'll only be sorry if you don't!!

My now husband and I know close to nothing about the logistics of weddings, so Paige Events was a must. We got a full service package (plus some add ons) from Paige Allenspach who ...

was absolutely integral for the months, weeks, days and the day of the wedding. She helped organize all vendor correspondences through zoom/Google meets and updated everyone on the timeline. She gave suggestions for things we had zero opinion on such as flower colors/composition, signage, etc which was a good starting point for us to know what see did or did not like. Every step of the way leading up to the wedding felt like things were in her good hands so as the bride, I felt very little stress during my own wedding! We found out a few days after the wedding that there was some issues with our shuttle service during the wedding, but Paige took care of the situation completely. We nor any of our guests felt impacted by the issue at all. So, we highly recommend Paige Events (especially the full service) if you want a smooth sailing wedding.

From the moment we first contacted Paige through the end of our 40-person wedding dinner, we had a trusted confidante throughout our wedding planning & execution process. Paige and...

team took detailed notes and carefully listened to our simple wedding plan, and helped execute on that vision without adding unnecessary complications or expenses. Not only was Paige a professional, she also went above and beyond when we had a slight mixup with our wedding photographer the evening before our wedding. On that Friday evening, she promptly jumped into action and had a backup wedding photographer ready to go at a moment’s notice. In addition, Paige and team were generous with their time and their equipment during the wedding. Overall, we were amazed by Paige’s professionalism and her level of attention that she provided in the midst of a busy wedding season. If you’re on the fence and reading this review, we highly recommend you give Paige Events a call!

I hired Paige Fox and Paige Allenspach as my planners about three months prior to my wedding, with no vendors selected except for the venue, the photographer, and the band. I termi...

nated the contract with my previous planner after noticing glaring mistakes at every corner. Paige Events had come highly recommended by multiple local vendors and so we gave them a call and were thrilled to find out they had one spot remaining this season. Many planners I spoke to after terminating my contract with my original planner were apprehensive about taking on my wedding given the time crunch and the fact that picking up the pieces of my former planner would be more complicated than planning a wedding from scratch. The Paiges were extremely confident in their ability to pull off my wedding despite the time crunch, so choosing them was an easy decision. Within days of contracting them, they hired a stellar vendor team (and I was a very picky bride). They honored my vision but didn't hesitate to push back when I proposed questionable ideas. Most importantly, they executed my wedding weekend seamlessly from start to finish (it was a 3 day affair). Beyond producing the most epic wedding weekend, with every single detail accounted for, they were one step ahead of us every time we encountered a problem— from fixing my broken heel to removing a lipstick stain from my partner's suit. I know from family and friends that there were dozens of other fires the Paiges put out that I never caught wind of. Even my guests were flabbergasted by how perfect every detail was. We have a few friends getting married this summer, and the running joke is that no one wants to followup our wedding because of how perfect everything was. I must be one of the toughest clients they've ever had. I have strong opinions, hold people to an extremely high standard, change my mind a lot, and am unapologetically direct. The Paiges navigated my difficult personality with so much grace and never once lost their cool or composure, even when I was admittedly not so composed. Hiring the Paiges was the best decision I made for my wedding, and I would do it again in a heartbeat.

very distinct vision for our wedding and Paige did everything to help me execute it, perfectly. From her excellent recommendations on vendors (shout out - Amy West Floral and Trevor at Santa Cruz DJ Company) to her personal connections within the industry and her INCREDIBLE, like nothing I have ever seen, day-of execution (making sure the wedding flowed nicely, everything was on time, myself, husband and family were all taken care of) etc. etc. .. I am confident knowing our wedding wouldn't have been what it was WITHOUT Paige. And, also, not only is she an amazing wedding planner but her knowledge of the Carmel / Monterey Area is unmatched (which is BEYOND helpful when you're getting married in the area but not that familiar with it). If I could give Paige 100 more stars I would, and I feel like after almost two years of working together... I walked away from this experience with a new friend. Book Paige. You won't regret it!

rs, Paige was by far the most genuinely sympathetic of them all AND the most willing to customize her assistance based on what we needed. We hired Paige four months out with a ton of help needed with tasks, vendors, and big decisions, and she led us through the process with patience and a clear expertise, while still balancing the numerous specific requests we had for our complicated, two-day Indian-Jewish fusion wedding with 180+ guests. She never suggested we compromise on anything we wanted and worked hard to make sure we didn’t have to, even with the condensed timeline for our planning. Paige also did an amazing job balancing her communication with us while also getting things done behind the scenes that we didn’t want to be fully involved with. The weekend of, she was always present, moving things along, but never intrusive. From our perspective (and our guests) the weekend went without a hitch, and I believe that is in large part due to Paige. I could truly go on about all the various little things Paige brings to wedding planning, which are unique to working with her: her calm decisiveness and constant optimism, her availability and consistent responsiveness, her intelligence and great aesthetic sensibility, and a genuine interest in sustainability. After two planners (and meetings with many more), I feel confident saying that Paige truly is one of the best.

tting to it. We had our wedding at a private venue, which can be challenging, but she rose to it and made it absolutely perfect! Like any couple, there were certain details that were extremely important to us, and she made those details equally important to her. Throughout the whole planning process, Paige was on top of every detail. She was easily available by phone or e-mail, which was incredibly valuable. She helped us pick excellent vendors, which helped make our day go smoothly. We also really appreciated that we struck the perfect balance between managing some parts independently and trusting her to manage others without us. We had a tighter budget in some categories, which she was very respectful of, providing us with different options to help execute our vision. The week of the wedding, we were so grateful and happy that she was coordinating all the vendors and logistics of the day, so we could relax and enjoy time together. She managed our rehearsal and wedding day so perfectly. If there was an issue, we would have never known about it. She and her assistant were so patient and remained so calm – all of our guests noticed it too! If there was something that needed our input during the day, she either asked our wedding party to avoid asking us, or she presented us with an easy solution, so all we had to say was Ok! Even more than that, I (the bride) am a Type 1 diabetic, and Paige listened to my needs for that day, working with my bridesmaids to make sure I didn’t have to think about anything diabetes related too much. She even dropped off the insulin that I left at the venue at our hotel on her way home. Like we said above, choosing Paige to plan our wedding was the best decision we made for our day, and we would choose her over and over again. We are immensely grateful to her! Thank you, Paige!
