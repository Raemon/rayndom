## 5 Things to Consider When Choosing a Diamond 

Before you start your search, take a moment to consider the different variables that affect the overall look, style and price of your diamond. The points below are a great starting point for understanding how to pick a diamond. 

  * Consider the 4 Cs
  * Set a budget
  * Decide on natural versus lab-grown
  * Select a shape
  * Pick a metal



## How to Choose a Diamond for an Engagement Ring

No two diamonds are alike, which is why it's important to understand the different factors that will inform your decision. Here's how to pick a good diamond for a ring.

### Consider the 4 Cs

One rule of thumb for how to choose a good diamond is to consider the [4 Cs](https://www.theknot.com/content/engagement-ring-diamond-grading). The 4 Cs of diamonds include carat, cut, color and clarity. These important factors to consider when [buying an engagement ring](https://www.theknot.com/content/engagement-ring-buying-steps) determine the overall look of the diamond, as well as the price. 

"Carat and cut go hand in hand: together they determine how big your diamond looks and how much it sparkles," Fisher explains. "A smaller, well-cut diamond can look brighter and more impressive than a larger, poorly cut one. Color is more personal—some people love a crisp, icy white, while others prefer a touch of warmth, especially in yellow or rose gold settings. [In my opinion] clarity tends to be overestimated in importance. Most inclusions aren't visible without magnification until you get into lower VS or SI grades, so you can often save money there without sacrificing beauty."

### Set a Budget

Before you begin looking at diamond options, you'll want to set a budget so that you know what you can reasonably afford. "First things first: Talk about budget," Fisher advises. "It's not the most exciting part, but it'll save you from headaches later. Agreeing on a range before you start shopping helps narrow the search and keeps you from falling in love with something that's way outside your comfort zone."

### Decide on Natural Versus Lab-Grown

Deciding upfront whether you want a [natural diamond](https://www.theknot.com/content/natural-diamonds) or a [lab-grown diamond](https://www.theknot.com/content/lab-grown-diamonds) will help guide your search. There are various pros and cons to both kinds of diamonds, and the decision truly comes down to personal preference. It's important to note that, unlike [diamond alternatives](https://www.theknot.com/content/diamond-alternatives) like moissanite, lab-grown diamonds are real diamonds. Advanced technology has allowed scientists to mimic the exact conditions for a diamond to form, so they can be created in a lab. The only physical difference between lab-grown and natural diamonds is where they were created. 

"It really comes down to budget and personal preference. Lab-grown diamonds offer amazing value—you'll get a larger, whiter, cleaner stone for the price," Fisher shares. "Natural diamonds, on the other hand, each have their own unique character. If you love the idea of a bigger, flawless look, lab-grown is hard to beat. If you're drawn to the timeless romance and rarity of something formed in the earth, natural might feel more meaningful."

### Select a Shape

The shape of your diamond affects the perceived size, sparkle and color, so it can be helpful to try a few different shapes to determine which one is best for you. Elongated diamond shapes, such as marquis or pear, have a slimming effect on the finger and can make the diamond appear larger; meanwhile, a classic round diamond has excellent brilliance, but may appear smaller due to its shape. "If you're looking at fancy shapes (anything but round), pay attention to ratio —it makes a huge difference in how the stone looks," Fisher explains. "A chunky cushion feels totally different from an elongated one, and that ratio can affect price, too."

Shape will also influence the overall style of your ring. A timeless round or emerald cut diamond is perfect for to-be-weds looking for a classic engagement ring, while more trendy shapes like pear add a unique twist to your ring. The decision ultimately comes down to what factors are most important to you as a couple and the overall look you are hoping to achieve. 

### Pick a Metal

Knowing which metal you plan to use for your ring is helpful to guide your diamond search, as diamonds may appear different against different metals. For example, white gold and platinum can enhance the brightness of a colorless diamond, but can make an older or lower-grade diamond appear slightly yellow. Similarly, yellow or rose gold can mask any yellow or brown shades in a lower-grade diamond. This is especially important to consider if you are thinking of using an antique or heirloom diamond, as an older diamond may have undergone some color change over time. Your jeweler can likely mock up different settings so you can see how your diamond looks against different metals.
