Hiring JoLee Blooms and Design to create the florals for our wedding day was the best decision we made. During the planning process, Daniele was extremely organized, professional a...

nd accommodating to help create our ideal party. She managed to walk the line to make our vision a reality but work within our budget. She was flexible with changes along the way and even helped with some non-floral decorations. She also came up with creative ways to reuse some design elements to make the budget stretch. She was always gracious with each change and limitation. Walking out into the venue on the wedding day, I couldn't believe my eyes. The JoLee team brought my mother and I to tears! I was fully able to trust the team to take our inspiration photos/ideas and run with it. Plus I appreciate their sustainable and local approach to sourcing the greens. They broke down the decorations that same night and left everything neat and organized for us to pickup the next day. We would use them again without hesitation.

Daniele at JoLee Blooms & Design is absolutely incredible to work with. Not only is she extremely talented as a florist, she was a huge help in planning, designing and making my li...

fe easy during the whole process. I even planned the wedding from across country! Daniele was always available if I had questions or changes throughout the design process. I was able to show her some inspiration or things I liked and she guided me through in order to get the exact look I was going for. She was spot on with bringing my vision to life and gave invaluable advice along the way. She's a great communicator and collaborator which was so important for us because it was a destination wedding. She is kind, she is dependable and her flowers are GORGEOUS. The color palettes and textures she creates are exceptional and she really brings your vision to life. Also, if you are figuring out as you go like I was, she knows exactly how to help guide you. We love Daniele and Jolee Blooms so much and could not have asked for a better experience. It was flawless all the way through! <3

rson meetings, and email check-ins. Every step of the way, she was so very helpful, thoughtful, and professional! She helped us plan the order of events for our wedding so it created a great flow! Without Daniele, our wedding wouldn't have been half as magical as it was. I felt like we were in a dream the entire day of our wedding. Everything ran so smoothly because of her attention to detail. And don't even get me started on the flowers! We had the most beautiful floral arrangements I have ever seen at a wedding. She did all our corsages, boutonnieres, centerpieces, and arrangements all around the venue. They were full of uniquely beautiful and colorful flowers, we were in awe of how it all came together. Everything was planned out so well. She and her amazing team made our wedding beautiful and unforgettable- even our friends and family members are still talking about what an amazingly beautiful wedding it was. If you want your wedding to run seamlessly, and your flowers to be spectacularly gorgeous - hire Daniele and Jolee Blooms. She will care about you every step of the way, give great advice, and support you with great energy and positivity. We want to do it all over again! Thanks again Daniele!
