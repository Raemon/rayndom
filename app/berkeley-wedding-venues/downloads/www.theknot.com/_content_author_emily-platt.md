## Important Questions from The Knot

### Best advice for to-be-weds?

Communicate—with your vendors, your family, your friends and most importantly, your partner.

### What’s your all-time favorite wedding song?

I love a good nostalgia moment, so really, any throwback song that brings back happy memories. It depends on the audience! 

### Dream celebrity wedding guest?

Honestly, having a celebrity at my wedding would probably stress me out… 

### Best wedding after party snack?

Bite-size fried chicken and waffles—a little sweet and a little savory.
