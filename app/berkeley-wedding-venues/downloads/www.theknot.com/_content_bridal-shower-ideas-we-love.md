## Unique Bridal Shower Ideas

![Unique Bridal Shower Ideas](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/944924af-59ba-4c79-add4-0b09beda2745~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1500.1125)

Even if you opt for a traditional framework, don't shy away from unique ideas for wedding showers. Yes, you can never go wrong with a classic round of the "shoe game," but adding these party elements to your [bridal shower checklist](https://www.theknot.com/content/a-bridal-shower-planning-checklist) will ensure your soiree stands out from the crowd. 

### 1\. Butterfly Cake

![Butterfly Cake](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/3c51a67f-2a7d-4201-a639-dd5bf8566b0f~rs_768.h-cr_1.0.1094.1457)

_[Photo: Jordan Maunder Photography](https://jordanmaunder.com/)_

Looking for some sweet and whimsical ideas for a bridal shower? Top a cake with a few feathery butterflies and big blooms. It would work perfectly for a "love is in bloom"-themed bridal shower that embraces all things floral. 

### 2\. Fortune Teller or Tarot Reader

![Fortune Teller or Tarot Reader](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/75615fa7-0926-425c-a0cc-c1a8e8c94df0~rs_768.h-cr_0.90.1080.1530)

_[Photo: Ashleigh Coleman Photography](https://www.ashleighcolemanweddings.com/)_

You can totally go the classic games route as bridal shower entertainment. Or, you can get a little mystical by booking a tarot card reader or psychic. Hire this vendor to swing by for 30 minutes to an hour (depending on the number of attendees) either when guests are mingling or between snacks and gifts.

### 3\. Personalized Honey Jar Favors

![Personalized Honey Jar Favors](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/4e6090d5-19d3-4d31-b11a-0ec635bdaa06~rs_768.h-cr_0.14.1094.1473)

_[Photo: Sposto Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/sposto-photography-signal-hill-ca-620447)_

The guest of honor is one of the sweetest folks you know, so why not lean into that by giving out some super sweet favors? Honey jars are a popular favor choice, but they become totally unique wedding shower ideas when personalized with each guest's name. Aim for local honey for an extra-personal touch.

### 4\. Pink Cocktail Tower

![Pink Cocktail Tower](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/eddee1c3-12a9-4dcd-ad75-92e85a762905~rs_768.h-cr_0.91.1094.1550)

_[Photo: Ashleigh Coleman Photography](https://www.ashleighcolemanweddings.com/)_

Okay, we get the couple might want to save the fun and froth of a champagne tower for the wedding day, but a cocktail tower of classy coupe glasses is an eye-catching display option for bridal shower drinks. Bonus points if the sips are pale pink and adorned with edible petals.

### 5\. Vintage China Plates

![Vintage China Plates](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/f662a973-bc9e-45d6-b6f4-325370484e47~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1094.1458)

_[Photo: Steph G. Bishop](https://www.stephgbishop.com/)_

Vintage china will always be one of the most lovely and unique wedding bridal shower ideas, since it adds detail and dimension to the tablescape. Another sweet thought if the shower will be held at someone's home: bringing in a few pieces of wedding china from special family members to create the tablescape and a total "aww" moment. 

### 6\. Personalized Stemless Wine Glasses

![Boho tablescape wedding shower idea 2023. ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/3ab2d557-0bf4-4912-b024-a2e7b4fa7964~rs_768.h-cr_113.0.1024.683)

_[Photo: Afrik Armando LLC](https://afrikarmando.com/),__[Florist: RAM Floral](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/ram-floral-norristown-pa-1061627)_

A cool substitute for place cards _and_ favors for guests? Sounds great. Source some pretty stemless wine glasses that suit the bridal shower color scheme and have a professional letter artist paint names on each. Or, you can easily order engraved glasses online. 

### 7\. Ribbon Photo Background

![DIY bridal shower photo booth](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/a6d1d4e3-42a7-4020-94b4-32b9d50a1437~rs_768.h-cr_0.33.982.1342)

_[Photo: Justin Wright Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/justin-wright-photography-nashville-tn-386488)_

Create a photo backdrop with the party's color palette using ribbons. Simply tie together a multitude of ribbons to create a textural background for all sorts of snaps and selfies. Use strands of different patterns, colors and fabrics to make your background especially eye-catching.

### 8\. Recipe Sharing

![Bridal shower recipes](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/2c482de1-1103-4c22-9fd1-a0f2f8ffa198~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.982.1309)

_Photo: Kate Headley_

This bridal shower idea involves asking guests to write their favorite recipe on a card to give to the to-be-wed(s). This sets up the future married couple with a personalized recipe box filled with dishes to whip up.

### 9\. Scratch-Off Game

![Place setting with scratch-off door game at wedding shower](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/c70b7c65-8f1c-49cd-9d1e-bda3a5e18df8~rs_768.h-cr_0.180.1080.1620)

_[Photo: Alexa Lynn Photography](https://www.alexalynnphoto.com)_

Craft stores often have supplies to make DIY scratch-off games. For example, you can have one card featuring a special icon like a ring and the guest who gets it receives a prize. Consider placing one beside each place card as a fun and simple game guests can do right when they sit down. 

### 10\. Keepsake Favorite Memory Cards

![Guest book memory cards at bridal shower](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/c45db2db-4c5e-4143-8ab6-1c401dc09498~rs_768.h-cr_0.193.2336.3308)

_[Photo: Terri Baskin Photography](https://terribaskin.com),__[Event Planning: B. Astonished Events](https://bastonishedevents.com)_

In addition to having a guest book at the bash, consider including party games that'll provide the to-be-wed with meaningful keepsakes of memories shared with the loved ones in attendance. These cards allow each guest to write about a special memory with the guest of honor for them to reflect on later. Too sweet. 

### 11\. Picnic Theme

![Pastel backyard picnic for a bridal shower.](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/f0af0cd0-9f1e-4339-a556-b5b1b9343213~rs_768.h-cr_0.90.1080.1530)

_[Photo: Katka Koncal](https://katkakoncal.com/)_

This is definitely one of the most cute bridal shower ideas on our list. If you're having a small gathering and the bride-to-be loves the outdoors, have a backyard picnic. We love how this lounge area has baby's breath flower crowns at each place setting and fluffy floor pillows.

### 12\. Heart-Note Guest Book 

![Heart-shaped guest book bridal shower idea 2023. ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/59d75279-b37b-4f6f-b097-d71bf7c707ab~rs_768.h-cr_0.188.1333.1965)

_Photo: Shelby Oliver Photography_

A guest book at the wedding is customary, but a shower guest book is also a sweet idea. Guests can get a little lengthier with their notes here, since it's a more intimate party. Plus, an additional keepsake from this special time in the couple's life is always welcome. 

### 13\. Seed Packet Favors

![Seed packet escort card idea for wedding showers 2023. ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/0b6bc419-fc37-4fcd-be6f-7eb2dcde521a~rs_768.h-cr_189.0.1966.1333)

_[Photography: Elizabeth Burgi Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/elizabeth-burgi-photography-newport-beach-ca-772650)_

Spring bridal shower? Opt for personalized seed packets as favors. We recommend going for a wildflower seed blend, since the blooms won't require much care. This way, even guests without green thumbs can reap the benefits of some beautiful blossoms.

## Cool Bridal Shower Ideas

![Cool Bridal Shower Ideas](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/764a5b90-5d0a-439f-8cad-2884b79ffb69~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1500.1125)

_Photos: Renee Hollingshead Photography, Anya Kernes Photography, Nikki Daskalakis,__Design: Natalie Romine_

For a bride or couple that skews edgy over elegant, cool wedding shower ideas are the answer. From food to decor, don't be afraid to buck tradition here. Scout out some stylish [bridal shower themes](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-shower-themes) and keep an eye out for cool [bridal shower trends](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-shower-trends) while you're at it. 

### 14\. Handwritten Fonts

![Handwritten Fonts](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/c7ab918a-17c0-4eaa-a0d7-9cb24c704f3b~rs_768.h-cr_0.91.1094.1550)

_[Photo: Rachel Leiner Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/rachel-leiner-photography-brooklyn-ny-2025841)_

We all know squiggles and handwritten stationery are the ultimate cool-girl wedding details, and carrying that look through to the bridal shower paper feels very chic and of the moment. Opt for imperfect fonts for placecards as well as any menus or buffet cards required.

### 15\. Elevated Candy Bar

![Elevated Candy Bar](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/b0001d19-3bcf-47e2-be3a-7be0ed702f03~rs_768.h-cr_0.38.1094.1497)

_[Photo: Rachel Leiner Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/rachel-leiner-photography-brooklyn-ny-2025841)_

Whether it's designed to be a favor or a sweet snack during the party, some treats from a fancy candy bar will always go over well. Arrange a selection of five or so candy options and place take-home bags and twist ties nearby.

### 16\. Sleek Shower Invites

![Sleek Shower Invites](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/9cfb500b-53a4-4bc0-bdc6-017f7184d29e~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1200.1200)

If cool ideas for a wedding shower are what you're after, then you'll need to set the tone with some chic [bridal shower invitations](https://www.theknot.com/paper/invitations/bridal-shower) that convey the right mood. This style leads with a punchy font and comes in a host of colors to match the party's scheme and theme.

[Scoop Up This Stationery](https://www.theknot.com/paper/product/pack-your-bags-bridal-shower-invitations?v=f9a1c742-a260-4245-a6ca-2f066bf33869&q=100)

### 17\. Tomato Centerpieces

![Tomato wedding centerpieces](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/b7ba688e-a95b-4945-90fb-e37579d4133e~rs_768.h-cr_0.17.1080.1457)

Incorporating some pretty produce into the tablescape is one of the best wedding shower ideas to celebrate a trendy couple who can't resist an Italian summer theme. On that note, feel free to move away from themes that feel bridal-centric. "No matter who the guest of honor is, allow the celebration to be about that person. Consider themes outside the regular 'blushing bride' concept and what the guest of honor loves," suggests Rachael Ellen Mayo, wedding planning expert and owner of [Rachael Ellen Events](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/rachael-ellen-events-holladay-ut-749411).

### 18\. Minimalist Bud Vases

![Minimalist Bud Vases](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/5ba2a9ad-3514-4710-8034-3c5602aac49e~rs_768.h-cr_0.91.1094.1550)

_[Photo: Bo Shim](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/bo-shim-new-york-ny-980553)_

Stemmy flowers look sculptural, yet unfussy, so they're the perfect addition to a cool bridal shower. Go for small, simple glass vessels and blooms with architectural petals like ranunculus or dahlias. Oh, and don't worry too much about how they're sitting in the vase—the carefree style works well here.

### 19\. High-Contrast Tablescape

![High-Contrast Tablescape](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/16f39b30-cf86-4d3b-8483-d42942bc3462~rs_768.h-cr_22.0.1071.787)

_[Photo: Meg Laffey Photography](https://www.meglaffeyphoto.com/)_

Sure, color palettes composed of muted pastels are a mainstay when it comes to ideas for a bridal shower, but choosing a contrasting color palette will be much more interesting. Take this red and green look, for example. Incorporate graphic patterns and cool textures to bring the look together. 

### 20\. Fruit Centerpieces

![Fruit Centerpieces](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/dfd1424a-f76c-4329-8bf7-fc7a8c8cc7e7~rs_768.h-cr_0.90.1080.1530)

_[Photo: Kami Arant Creative](https://www.kamiarant.com/)_

Fruit and flowers are a match made in heaven (just like the happy couple). Arrange aesthetically pleasing produce like halved citrus, grapes and pomegranates down the center of the table and intersperse candles in between for a tablescape perfectly suited for an autumnal shower. 

### 21\. Charcuterie Board Competition

![Bridal shower charcuterie board competition](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/2934d069-3faf-4cfe-a0cb-03b4850acbbd~rs_768.h-cr_0.128.1536.2176)

_Photo: Katerina Kutas Photography,__Caterer: Preludio Noleggio_

Simple bridal shower ideas don't mean boring. For a small [at-home bridal shower](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-shower-ideas-at-home), consider having a competition for who can make the most striking and cohesive [bridal shower charcuterie board](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-shower-charcuterie-board). Each guest can choose their own theme or color palette for their creation, and whoever the guest of honor deems has the best board gets a prize.

### 22\. Pottery Party Favors

![Bar cart with pastel-hued coffee mugs](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/94d3c3ff-eb4d-495a-afe7-b98aa84d9e85~rs_768.h-cr_0.116.1080.1556)

_[Photo: Lieb Photographic LLC](https://liebphotographic.com),__[Pottery: Erica Millholland Ceramics](https://www.etsy.com/shop/ErikaMarieCeramics)_

Whether the guest of honor has a penchant for the wheel themself or just knows where to source local pottery, handmade mugs are a bridal shower favor that comes straight from the heart. Perhaps you might even place them next to a well-stocked coffee or tea bar at the party. 

### 23\. DIY Fragrance Bar

![Bridal shower DIY fragrance bar](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/10b31bcf-736e-4c0d-862e-e7a72ad54194~rs_768.h-cr_0.33.982.1342)

_Photo: Jordan Maunder Photography_

Add an interactive bridal shower activity by having a fragrance bar at the affair. Simply contact your favorite custom perfume purveyor that has the ability to be booked for events. You could also procure different essential oils for folks to blend. 

### 24\. Boba Bar

![Bridal shower boba bar](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/8d21a36c-b506-4ad9-83fb-8e9fc19f91c3~rs_768.h-cr_0.20.1600.2153)

_[Photo: Sposto Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/sposto-photography-signal-hill-ca-620447)_

Need more bridal shower inspiration? Then steal this tasty bridal shower idea. Bubble tea with tapioca boba has been all the rage for the past couple of years, so why not have a boba bar at your event? Allow guests to customize their drink by having a variety of flavors, boba and lychee jelly options.

Who says bridal showers have to be fancy brunches? An at-home pajama party is one of the coziest ideas for wedding showers we can dream of. Ask guests to don their comfiest fits and plan some classic sleepover games and activities (even if everyone is headed home by the late afternoon). 

### 27\. Heart-Shaped Dishware

![Heart-Shaped Dishware](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/8079aa49-5a99-41f0-8a78-82555aebdb86~rs_768.h-cr_0.98.1080.1538)

### 28\. Instant Camera

_[Photo: Aubrey Beth Photography](https://aubreybethphotography.com/)_

Whether you opt to assign a bridesmaid to take point on snapping photos of the party or you simply leave a camera or two around for guests to play with, an instant camera is an _instant_ crowd-pleaser. Keep some extra film on hand. 

### 29\. Western Bridal Shower Invites

![Western Bridal Shower Invites](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/61df5c39-186d-4a2e-9ee1-6650f2487b5f~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1200.1200)

If the shoe (or cowboy boot) fits, then these Western-inspired bridal shower invites will totally hint at the fun to come the moment they hit guests' mailboxes. Though, do think through any theme you select with care. Virginia Frischkorn, wedding planning expert and owner of [Partytrick](https://www.partytrick.com/blog/meet-the-founder-virginia-frischkorn), encourages anyone planning a wedding shower to "pick a theme! It's so much easier for guests to get excited and choose gifts if there's a theme." However, Karina Lopez, expert event and wedding planner and owner of [KC You There](https://www.kcyouthere.com/), advises that you don't need to go overboard with thematic party ideas. "Themes can sometimes get a bit out of hand. Play off the feel and color of your venue, and when in doubt, pick a focal piece and incorporate mini details here and there."

The host will ask which partner is more likely to do a certain task or act a certain way. Each to-be-wed will hold one of their own shoes and one of their partner's shoes. They'll hold up whichever shoe corresponds to the person most likely to do whatever the question asks.

### 31\. Cotton Candy Station

![Custom cotton candy station](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/e94c6a71-aea6-44e0-b7c7-33dcde8b56c3~rs_768.h-cr_0.35.1080.1475)

_[Photo: Laura Moll Photography](https://www.lauramoll.net),__[Catering: Fluff Gourmet Cotton Candy](https://www.fluffnashville.com)_

You'll score major points with a to-be-wed who has a sweet tooth with a cotton candy station. Some cotton candy companies even allow the guests to make their own confections. Be sure to have a few treat bags on hand for guests to take some home.

### 32\. Photo Cupcakes

![Custom cupcakes with picture of bride](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/ccc3b58c-7679-44ad-a44f-611244d84f80~rs_768.h-cr_367.0.3482.2336)

_[Photography: Terri Baskin Photography](https://terribaskin.com),__[Event Planning: B. Astonished Events](https://bastonishedevents.com),__[Cake: Mon Delice](https://www.mondeliceblog.com/)_

Even the desserts at this bridal shower put the bride-to-be front and center. Vanilla cupcakes with an image of the nearly newlywed were served for dessert. Bonus point if you choose a silly shot of the honoree, so long as it's not embarassing. 

### 33\. Balloon Installation

![Teal-and-pink balloon installation ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/c156a188-5a7c-42b3-9ec8-4db55b70e055~rs_768.h-cr_385.0.3500.2336)

_[Photo: Terri Baskin](https://terribaskin.com/),__[Event Planning: B. Astonished Events](https://bastonishedevents.com/),__[Backdrop: Luxe Ambiance](https://luxeambianceevents.com/)_

A balloon installation is always welcome. Not only is it dramatic, but the arrangement serves as a photo backdrop for bridal shower guests to pose in front of. It's a great option for a more gender-neutral couples shower or for a soonlywed who doesn't dig flowers. 

### 34\. Ice Cream Sandwiches

![Ice cream sandwiches atop cake stand](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/b75a2518-d668-496e-b4a4-6795f2f77270~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1080.1440)

_[Photo: Apollo Fotografie](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/apollo-fotografie-photo-+-video-san-francisco-ca-542367)_

If a cake isn't the to-be-wed's cup of tea, consider an alternative dessert offering like ice cream sandwiches. This is a great choice because the flavor combinations are endless. Just be sure to have a vegan-friendly dessert option on hand for any guests with dietary restrictions.

### 35\. Individual Cakes

![Mini individual naked cakes](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/6a3bd67f-a124-487e-ace3-731f16e31001~rs_768.h-cr_0.119.1080.1559)

_[Photography: Liron Erel & Co.](https://lironerelco.com),__[Catering: Mini Melanie](https://minimelanie.com)_

Each guest at this bash received their own petite semi-naked cake. For people who love sweets, this is the perfect amount of sugar. Choose two to three different flavor options. (We think funfetti would be a welcome choice for a fun bridal shower.)

### 36\. This or That Game

![Bridal shower game card](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/4506c385-5970-4d7f-aa82-0c4c1eb85367~rs_768.h-cr_162.650.2047.3163)

_[Photo: Terri Baskin Photography](https://terribaskin.com),__[Event Planning: B. Astonished Events](https://bastonishedevents.com)_

Crunchy or smooth peanut butter? Red or white wine? See how well close friends really know the guest of honor with a game where guests have to choose what they like between various options. This is a great game pick if you're looking for fun things to do at a wedding shower that keep guests seated.

### 37\. Custom Sugar Cookies

![Custom duck-inspired sugar cookies](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/f0e83549-e70c-4131-b313-666e0d7b3c99~rs_768.h-cr_0.17.1080.1457)

Reinforce the bash's aesthetic with on-theme decorated sugar cookies. This happy couple wanted duck-hunting-inspired sweets at their wedding shower. Match the icing on each cookie to the event's chosen color scheme. 

## Elegant Bridal Shower Ideas

![Elegant Bridal Shower Ideas](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/e3c94857-ec8e-4eb7-9cbd-dba9ec457a80~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1500.1125)

_Photos: Stocksy, Madeleine Collins Photography, Shannon Moffit Photography,__Design: Natalie Romine_

A classy event is the right choice if the bridal shower will include a large number of older guests who might be less interested in games and more excited for a refined luncheon and watching the guest of honor show their gratitude for a few gifts in real time. Opt for formal [bridal shower venues](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/rehearsal-dinners-bridal-showers) and upscale [bridal shower favors](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-shower-favors) to set the mood. PS: Proper [bridal shower invite etiquette](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-shower-invite-etiquette) will be super important with this style of shower. 

### 38\. Romantic Florals

![Romantic Florals](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/53b4aac9-7610-44e8-af9d-708713c593f1~rs_768.h-cr_0.91.1094.1550)

_Photo: Megan Noll Photography,__[Floral design: The Budding Florist](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/the-budding-florist-cincinnati-oh-2002179)_

Blush and blue floral centerpieces look effortlessly elegant, especially when paired with taper candles and classic cut-crystal tableware. Opt for classic blooms like peonies and roses to bring that romantic element, and punctuate the arrangement with more modern blooms like dahlias. 

### 39\. Chinoiserie Place Settings

![Chinoiserie Place Settings](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/e5d61f5f-23a7-4cd6-9167-8f42b5257908~rs_768.h-cr_0.13.1094.1472)

_[Photo: Sposto Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/sposto-photography-signal-hill-ca-620447)_

Nothing says classic like blue-and-white Chinoiserie china, especially if it's on the table at a preppy, coastal bridal shower. Play into the color scheme with napkins, tablecloths and other decor. Add in a splash of yellow for a contrasting hue. 

### 40\. Tea Bar

![Bridal shower tea bar](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/a9e83e53-3e37-4b6d-9298-28a56696593b~rs_768.h-cr_0.17.1080.1457)

_[Photo: Stetten Wilson](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/stetten-wilson-los-angeles-ca-1009237)_

Add a touch of luxury to your prewedding event with a tea bar. This is a great choice for those who want non-alcoholic options or people having a [tea party bridal shower theme](https://www.theknot.com/content/tea-party-bridal-shower-theme). If you want to kick this idea up a notch, add personalized tea mugs to the bar so guests have a special favor to take home.

### 41\. Mini Berry Parfaits

![Tiered-tray with individual fruit parfait cups](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/a5d9e3e6-188e-4657-9965-b0418b0efe9d~rs_768.h-cr_426.762.2880.4034)

_[Photography: Jeremy Chou Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/jeremy-chou-photography-rancho-cucamonga-ca-497551),__[Catering: Le Papillon](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/le-papillon-san-jose-ca-399851)_

For a [brunch shower](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-shower-brunch), add berry parfaits to the menu. Individual servings are one of the best ways to let guests nibble on all of the tasty menu offerings you're serving. And displaying them in a tiered dish like this ups the sophistication factor. 

### 42\. Mimosa Bar

![Blue watercolor bar menu sign, wedding shower ideas 2023. ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/6516f27e-12ff-4dc9-97f7-73afa73a8c37~rs_768.h-cr_0.193.2336.3308)

_[Photo: Terri Baskin Photography](https://terribaskin.com),__[Event Planning: B. Astonished Events](https://bastonishedevents.com)_

To add a celebratory feel to your shower, break out the bubbly with a festive mimosa bar for wedding shower guests to enjoy. You can even have small carafes of juices for people to grab and add to their bubbles nearby.

### 43\. Garden Rose Centerpiece

![Lush centerpiece with pink roses. Bridal shower idea 2023. ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/3958609f-f84b-448c-8a1f-ac14ce3eec13~rs_768.h-cr_4.0.1080.1434)

_[Photo: Erica Streelman](https://www.ericastreelman.com),__[Floral Design: Bloom Theory](https://www.bloomtheory.com)_

Talk about dreamy. This romantic centerpiece is breathtaking and is one of our favorite pastel bloom arrangements. You can never go wrong with traditional roses when it comes to elegant wedding shower ideas. Use a stone urn for a more romantic feel. 

### 44\. Lily of the Valley Cake

![Simple white cake with lily of the valley decorations](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/b6115109-f429-4346-8931-f201ae8b5635~rs_768.h-cr_0.66.736.1047)

_[Photo: Alyssa Davis](https://www.instagram.com/alyssa_ndavis/),__[Event Planning: KC You There](https://kcyouthere.com)_

There's a reason the royals love to use lilies of the valley in wedding arrangements. The blooms, even in icing form, are beautiful. These flowers also symbolize sweetness and a "return to happiness," so they're very fitting for a wedding-adjacent event. 

### 45\. Lemon Cakes

![Trio of mini cakes with lemon decorations](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/3b73b9c6-0ddd-424d-8770-33ca867783dc~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.3000.4000)

_[Photo: Jenny Quicksall Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/jenny-quicksall-photography-newbury-ca-982120),__[Cake: Sweet Nouvelette](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/sweet-novelette-los-angeles-ca-1009364)_

Especially for a tea party theme, mini cakes and sandwiches lend themselves well to a high-tea-inspired menu. We love how each cake is personalized with a guest's name. As a bonus, they can also double as place cards and favors if you pack them in clear take-home boxes.

### 46\. Fresh Fruit Spread

![Fresh fruit spread at a bridal shower. ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/8ba4ce7f-849f-4df7-b8dc-bd833540e1cb~rs_768.h-cr_0.215.2581.3656)

_[Photo: Ryan & Jacy Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/ryan-and-jacy-photography-bothell-wa-819798)_

Treat the guests to a delicious and refreshing array of fruits for a breakfast or lunch affair. Imagine how refreshing this platter would be at a mid-summer shower? Or if guests could also select produce from this spread to blend into a smoothie? 

### 47\. Flower Petal Bar

![Bridal shower flower bar](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/01f44947-3bbf-40d7-a290-30f79aa091a4~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.873.1164)

_[Photo: Rodeo & Co. Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/rodeo-and-co-photography-landaff-nh-241047)_

A [flower bar at a bridal shower](https://www.theknot.com/content/flower-bar-bridal-shower) is a great opportunity for guests to make their own flower arrangements. It doubles as a unique activity and shower favor. Have guests pick their favorite petals or flowers to create a fresh assortment.

### 48\. Fresh Juice Bar

![Fresh juice bar with custom signage](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/afa2dfa2-c747-433a-a0b8-5c91eee231f0~rs_768.h-cr_0.17.1080.1457)

_[Photo: Christina McNeill Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/christina-mcneill-photography-san-francisco-ca-412441)_

Start a morning wedding shower off right with fresh-squeezed juice. This is a good option for parties that want [non-alcoholic beverages](https://www.theknot.com/content/non-alcoholic-wedding-drinks) for their guests that feel a little more unique than iced tea or lemonade. 

### 49\. Lavender Favor

![Dried lavender favor display](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/4b34a09c-5e60-41b7-8436-ce64c1d59b7d~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1080.1440)

_[Photo: Lauren Fair Photography](https://laurenfairphotography.com)_

People love getting [party favors](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-shower-favors) they can actually use later. Guests at this event could select a bunch of dried lavender flowers or a lavender soap to enjoy. You could also make sachets with the dried blooms that guests can tuck into their dresser drawers or use to scent a small space. 

### 50\. Single-Tier Cake

![Simple one-tier wedding cake with fresh fruit and flowers atop white cake stand](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/516dbe76-f18d-42be-948d-be558fa1a993~rs_768.h-cr_2.0.1078.1435)

_[Photo: Erica Streelman](https://www.ericastreelman.com),__[Cake: Grace and Honey Cakes](https://www.graceandhoneycakes.com/)_

There's so much to love about this cheerful and petite cake. Fresh blooms and fruit, decorative icing and even an eye-catching milk-glass stand are everything you want at an elegant wedding shower.
