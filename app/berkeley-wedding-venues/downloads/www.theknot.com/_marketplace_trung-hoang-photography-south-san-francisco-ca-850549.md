Your wedding is a special day. A special day for you, your partner, your families and friends. The goal for me when photographing your big day is to capture photographs that will help you and your loved ones relive that day for years and and generations to come. It's not just about the events and moments, but capturing the love, excitement, and jubilance that comes with such a momentous occasion. I want you to have the best day humanly possible. It's a once in a lifetime opportunity and photography should be the least of your concerns on that day. Enjoy the day, enjoy your company, and leave it to me to capture it all.

Trung

Owner

My name is Trung, the head honcho at this eponymously named company. My name is pronounced “Troon”, which sounds like spoon, so ignore those other letters that make life complicated. I’m born, raised, and still residing in the San Francisco Bay Area with my wife Julie. You can often find me; at home watching sports, in the kitchen experimenting with a new technique, drinking or roasting coffee, or just finding some form of salty snack to enjoy (I will eat all things fried potato), getting up at an unnecessary time in the morning to catch a sunrise, or on an outdoor adventure with Julie.

tember 2025. He exceeded our sky-high expectations and was easily our favorite vendor. He captured so many precious moments, and almost felt like another wedding coordinator/bridesmaid/groomsman because he was so helpful throughout the day. His humor and overall demeanor made us feel really comfortable in front of the camera even though we are usually not at all. He made everyone look good and really captured some wonderful dance floor photos, which we didn't expect! We are so happy we chose him, and would not hesitate to hire him again in the future.

tic presence that made taking the photos - particularly the portraits - enjoyable! He’s a true professional who knows exactly how to direct people for the right shots but also knows how to capture the perfect candid moment. We were amazed by how many photos he took given he was just one person! What really impressed us was how he spent a little extra time at our wedding to capture the final moments, even though we didn’t expect him to. I was amazed by how he sent several of the best photos the next morning too! His gallery is well organized and he’s very responsive. I cannot recommend working with Trung enough — he will make your special occasion unforgettable in the best way!

Trung is an awesome wedding photographer! Our wedding reception was inside a hotel ballroom, so we knew we needed to hire someone who could handle indoor lighting and 150+ guests. ...

Trung and his assistant totally crushed it, capturing the energy and pure joy at our event. He was also upbeat, relaxed, and easy to work with. Now we have hundreds of fun, amazing photos to relive our day over and over. Highly recommend if you want to capture the fun vibes at your wedding.

rt of the wedding day timeline. He even gave me (the bride) a ride to the venue because all of the cars were filled! On top of that, he helped us record our ceremony and first dance as a stand-still recording when we asked. Above and beyond in every sense. And throughout the event, he was additive to the vibe. Beautiful pictures, awesome guy, and chose a great second photographer for our event as well. If you're wavering, don't! If you're unsure, just choose him. If you're still looking around, you can stop now. We loved working with Trung, we love the photos he took for us, and we cannot recommend him enough.

ook for our engagement and wedding. I instantly knew that he was going to be the perfect fit after he did our engagement photos. My husband and I are both camera shy and feared the moment we were going to be on the spotlight. To make it more complicated, our schedules made planning extremely difficult. But Trung was patient along the way and showed us he was very easy going. He made us feel stress-free, making us laugh and getting to know us so it felt more natural. He’s very organized and ensured he had our venues schedule well ahead of our big day. On our wedding day, it was raining off and on. Trung was very flexible and came up with a game plan on his own of when we would do the outdoor photos and where we would do indoor photos. My family also had certain request, and he respected all of them, no questions asked. Our photos also turned out stunning. I like his style, his edits look very natural and the photos turn out bright and vivid. Trung, thank you for making our special day relaxing and giving us photos we will truly enjoy for the rest of our lives.

I normally do not leave reviews, but I had to for Trung! My husband and I recently got married exactly 1 week ago, and we are still over the moon about how everything went. It was ...

quite literally the best day of our life. I can say that Trung, 100%, added to it. We were lucky enough to work with Trung as our photographer for both our engagement shoot & our wedding day. I found Trung’s work while planning for the wedding, on a blog. And I immediately fell in love with his work. I would describe it as “the ability to capture candid, intimate moments, where you can palpate the genuine emotions in a photograph.” I’ve been to >25 weddings, with me being in half of them as a bridesmaid. I knew what I didn’t want, which were forced, fake smiles, stiff poses. I wanted photos that felt real through paper. Trung did that for us, plus more. For me, I am 100% uncomfortable in front of a camera. Awkward smile, stiff hands. How do I pose? My husband is also the same LOL. Trung has the magical ability to help us relax, have a good time, and enjoy the process. I don’t think he took 1 photo I didn’t like! Which was surprising, because there were moments where I did look like a hot mess in person LOL. I was BLOWN away by the photos. I think my husband and I said “WOW!” several times. Trung’s ability to capture lighting, landscape, emotions.. bar none. Everything appeared natural, but you could tell were, professionally done. For him to capture such unforgettable moments, on the best day of our life, was truly priceless. He is both fun to work with, and in my opinion, his work is at the top of his field. I will be working with Trung in the future for other life events for sure. I trust him wholeheartedly to make photos come alive, and for people to come alive, too :) we love you Trung!

After an exhaustive search, we chose Trung initially because we liked his pictures, he matched our low-key vibes, had great reviews, and offered his services at a reasonable price....

We are so happy we did. His pictures of our wedding are outstanding, and a few days after the event, he sent us a large preview of photos that made the whole family happy. He sent us the full photo list 6 weeks later and we were so impressed with the way he organized it to allow us to quickly find our favorites. He was also friendly and fun during the wedding. He vibed with our guests and integrated seamlessly into the event. He made both of us feel comfortable during the initial staged couple shots and never rushed us. Finally, Trung is very well organized. He was able to take all of the different permutations of group photos we asked and directed family and friends assertively but kindly. We highly recommend Trung!!

foremost, we loved his photography style, which captures warm, true-to-life colors that flatter a wide range of skin tones and work well with all types of lighting. He did a wonderful job of capturing spontaneous/candid moments during our Indian and Western wedding ceremonies, as well as efficiently getting through our (long) list of family portraits! He and his wife also were a true pleasure to work with over the entire weekend -- flexible, easy and fun to hang out with, but also incredibly efficient/focused on capturing great photos. Lastly, compared to other photographers we had looked at, his pricing was quite reasonable (a great bonus!) We absolutely love our photos and would highly recommend Trung to anyone looking for an exceptional and easy-to-work with wedding photographer!

We hired Trung as our photographer for our wedding in November and it honestly was the one of the best decisions we made! Trung is a truly talented and professional photographer an...

d artist. We reached out to Trung and scheduled a virtual meeting so we could get to know each other. This was helpful since we’d be coming from out of state to San Francisco and we needed as much organization and simplicity as possible. Trung’s pricing structure, contract, and timelines were clear and concise, minimizing our to-do checklist and keeping us within budget. The days leading up to the wedding, he was very communicative on scheduling and last-minute details. The morning of the wedding, he arrived early to our hotel and ready to document the day! Although he had never worked with our videographer, Trung had great professional chemistry with him and worked in tandem without being disruptive or “in-the-way” while everyone was getting ready. He floated seamlessly between the two rooms the men and women were getting ready in, which allowed so many different moments to be captured. Trung was also very helpful while we were both getting ready- he even helped my husband tie his bowtie! He was very charming and charismatic, which put me, my husband, and our families at ease. Trung was fantastic at giving direction as to where to look, how to change our body language, and even how to walk so he could capture natural moments. After the few hours spent working together, Trung really did become an extension of our small family wedding. Looking back, we would not have had the same wonderful experience if he was not part of our special day. Our families look back at the photos quite often and we happily relive the day through the stunning photos Trung took. Do yourselves a favor and hire Trung immediately!

From our engagement photos to the wedding day itself, Trung has been an easy-going, friendly, and witty personality that accompanied us on our journey. He was able to make us laugh...

and feel more comfortable when we posed for photos. Now that we’ve gotten the preview of the photos from the reception, we can confidently say that Trung was able to capture the magic of that night -- the colors, the lights, the energy. He made us look like how we felt: on top of the world. On top of that, he helped me tie my bowtie! His wife Julie served as the second shooter and complemented him well, capturing the behind-the-scenes getting-ready portion of the day without us feeling awkward. She was super nice and friendly, and captured so much of that night without us really noticing. But the photos are the proof. It was so nice not to have to think about using our phones to capture any of the night, as we knew we’d have full coverage thanks to Trung and Julie. They even stayed an extra half-hour to the end, to finish off the night with us.

He is speedy while still getting beautiful shots, and we are so happy with our photos from both our engagement (taken in the beautiful Marin headlands) and our wedding ceremony and reception. He was so flexible and clearly comfortable working in a wide variety of settings; his natural, candid style comes through no matter what.

Trung was so enjoyable to work with! He is professional and fun, and good-natured to the max. After a quick reply to our initial email, we met once before the big day, and let me t...

ell you: Trung really understood what we wanted to have captured at our wedding, and executed it beautifully. He captured wonderful moments of our ceremony, and with our friends and family before and after. He also took lovely photos that we didn't know we'd want, that are now core memories of our wedding. Not to mention that he is really good at making a last-minute boutonniere, and going with the flow during a spontaneous day-of hangout with some dear friends (again capturing dear memories of our last morning as fiancées). In short, I highly recommend Trung to photograph your wedding - we are SO happy with the memories he captured in his beautiful photos, and to have had such a warm and relaxing presence at our wedding <3

Trung and his wife Julie are a dream team. We discovered Trung through a google search and instantly loved his photographic style and personality. We met with him over Zoom, and he...

was genuine, kind and straight forward (amazing how his personality came through a webcam). As my husband and I are both kinda awkward in front of the camera, we knew that we wanted someone who would be super chill and put us at ease; Trung was the perfect person. He was extremely easy to communicate with throughout the process and answered all of my pesky emails thoughtfully and promptly. He sent us multiple examples of his wedding photography specific to our venue (not just the highlights! the full albums for each wedding) and what impressed us most was how he and Julie seamlessly captured both artistic portraits and priceless candids, with beautiful natural lighting and rich colors that felt real and timeless. When I asked for videographer recommendations he shared his favorites and we ended up choosing Denis with Splendent Films - he and Trung have worked together before and we had an amazing experience with Denis as well. If you want a phenomenal videographer/photographer duo, we strongly recommend both Trung and Denis! The wedding day was one of the happiest and shortest days of our lives! We cannot be more grateful for all the priceless photos which we will cherish for years to come. Trung sent us so many sneak peek photos just the day after the wedding, and we received the entire album under a month later. We recommend him and Julie to any couple looking for a genuinely kind, selfless, and talented team with a style that excels at capturing timeless memories, with each photo telling a story and helping you relive your wedding day. We will be reliving ours through the amazing photos for years to come.

an absolute pleasure to work with. He was so fun and calming during our photo session that I didn't realize where the time went. We got so many beautiful shots, in so many different poses/locations/settings and it was one of the best photography experiences I have ever had. Between the shots, he kept us laughing and enjoying the day. Even after our session, when we needed an expert opinion on another set of photos, he was more than willing to share his thoughts. Trung is a great guy and just as talented a photographer.

On the day, he did a great job handling our large and disorganized families and corralling them for all the group and individual photos we had discussed. Trung is personable, respectful, and has the polite assertiveness necessary for getting everything done on the day. We recommend him highly and very much appreciated his transparent and fair pricing!

He is easy to work with and we were so happy to have him at our wedding and feel so lucky to have documented the memories so beautifully.

If you’ve come here looking for a photographer to capture an important moment in your life then we want to help you on your search and tell you that Trung is the photographer for y...

ou. It took us a while to find Trung, we interviewed multiple photographers for our wedding, some doing wedding photos as a side job, others doing it as a team while in college, and some who would have cost more than the entire wedding put together. Having decided to do the reception in South San Francisco we did a google search for photographers in the area and Trung came up first. We sent a request to Trung to meet over zoom and learned about each other. Since the beginning all the way up to the day of our wedding Trung was professional, personable, considerate, and punctual. Trung had made sure to find out before the wedding the types of photos we were looking for, who would be in the photos and the location of each so on the day of the wedding he was well prepared and captured all photos that were a must have. Not only did Trung work well with us, but he worked well with the other vendors and was even able to help direct those who mostly spoke Vietnamese. We are glad we found Trung, he is the kind of person you would want to invite as a friend to your wedding. And finally, getting to see my beautiful wife on our wedding day and getting to relive the day through Trung's photos is the best money we've ever spent.

ecious moment and captured it in time for us to save and cherish it forever. Trung is incredibly talented, and his photos are authentic, romantic, impressive and just fabulous. His work speaks for itself. But let me talk about how easy and memorable it was to work with Trung. He makes you feel at ease and comfortable during your session, you completely feel you can be yourselves! He put so much effort into making us feel relaxed and making memories all while capturing beautiful photos! With a unique photo style, every moment is so accurately expressed, the love and passion he captures in his art is so incredibly amazing. Trung is fine art style of photography that really makes you feel all kinds of great emotions! He is very creative and knows how to direct you without making you feel awkward or uncomfortable. Our session with him was light and fun, and most importantly, personal! We loved all the photos that came back to us! He was super quick in his responses and very helpful and informative. We couldn’t be happier with how our photographs turned out! We were very fortunate to work with Trung! We would highly recommend him! 10/10 recommend! Nataša&Vladimir

Trung was an amazing photographer to work with, and the easiest of our vendors to work with. He and his wife, who typically shoots with Trung, came to the venue to tour it with us ...

and get a feel for the area. His communication and organization are top notch. Most importantly for my wife who is camera-shy, Trung is great at making people feel comfortable around a camera, and directing poses and looks that he thought would be nice. As a hobbyist photographer, some things I really appreciated about him are he is someone who is completely ok with you taking the digital files he gives you and editing them yourself, which some photographers do not allow. He also takes amazing landscape photos, and brings those skills and artistic sensibilities into his editing and wedding photography. Other things about Trung: 1) Punctual 2) Flexible (our wedding ended up running behind and suffered a blackout at the venue, both of which he took in stride) 3) Captures great photos, posed and candid! My wife and I would hire Trung again in a heartbeat!

He made everyone feel comfortable and our friends and family loved working with him. We got sneak peek photos the very next day, and the full set was delivered in under 4 weeks, where he took extra care to make sure they landed in our inboxes just hours before we landed from our return flight at the end of our honeymoon. Overall just a super professional, fun, thoughtful, and talented photographer that you won’t regret hiring!

Trung exceeded our expectations for a photographer. My now husband and I opted for a very low key wedding at SF City Hall, but wanted to have nice photos to remember the day. We “...

splurged” on getting a professional photographer, but really we got an outstanding deal for the quality and professionalism delivered. Trung knew exactly where to have us stand for optimal lighting, and how to have us pose while still looking natural. Since he’s had experience with city hall weddings, he helped walk us through the process and where to go. He also stretched the amount of time to more than what we agreed on to ensure we got all the photos we wanted with our families. Overall, 10/10 experience; would recommend to anyone!

I needed someone I could trust to be in my personal bubble for many hours that day. Trung exudes a confidence that was crucial for our time frame and our to do list. We chose the two-photographer package and it was perfect for what we wanted. I highly recommend this if you want to cover all the formal and candid moments of your wedding. Trung was able to completely focus on us, our close family and wedding party; at the same time, we felt happy knowing our guests and the little details were being captured as well. Now for the photos - they are INCREDIBLE! I love Trung's photography style. We are so grateful to Trung and how he captured us on one of the most important days of our lives.

helped put everyone at ease. He was able to make the family photos happen quickly and they looked great. He and his second shooter managed to be everywhere during the wedding while blending in seamlessly. He turned the final photos around quickly and they are wonderful. His online albums are nicely organized. It's easy to access and share the photos. He took a great mix of portraits (that don't look too fake/posed) and candids. And, his prices are reasonable in the scheme of Bay Area photographers - and the quality of his work far exceeded what we saw from more expensive photographers. He exceeded our expectations and we highly recommend him!

ve and present: having him at our wedding helped keep us comfortable throughout the day. Weeks, days, and hours before the wedding, Trung coordinated where/when to meet, helped iron out plans in case of rain, helped us pick out venues to take photos in, etc. He captured beautiful, candid moments but also provided enough structure to get all the photos of our families and friends that we wanted. It was the perfect balance of staging and capturing genuine moments. He made sure to get the required staged family photos but also turned our quirkiness into some of our favorite photos (like when we unexpectedly came across a vending machine). He and Julie were always there when we wanted a photo, but never in the way--they only ever added to our day. And, of course, the photos they took were beautiful--consistent in quality but with a variety of styles and effects. They took a stormy and rainy day and somehow made it romantic and intimate. They scoped out the best tiny spots of the venue before the day--spots that we hadn't seen even having visited multiple times! But more than that, they captured the feel of our wedding perfectly. It was chaos, hilarity, and love; that was all captured in the story of photos Trung sent us!
