It was clear from the first Zoom call that Brandon was going to be our DJ/MC for our wedding day. As a couple, we love dancing and opted for a longer reception so we wanted our gue...

sts to have as much fun on the dance floor as possible. His years of experience DJ and MC-ing coupled with his genuine enthusiasm and approach to such a crucial part of our big day gave us confidence. He also offers an array of services from a Photo Booth, disco ball, lighting, musical accompaniment, etc to really round out the experience. We felt comfortable and excited to brainstorm ideas, review our wishes and concerns, and throughout Brandon gave us true advice and feedback to make sure everything was perfect. On the wedding day Brandon was very mindful of our needs and checked in with us. He set the tone and we were all ready to party! On the dance floor he took us across decades and genres and kept guests of all ages on the dance floor - even some people that I’ve never seen dance before! He said, “I DJ with my eyes more than my ears” and boy did it show! We had so much fun and could really see that our guests were enjoying. We were flooded with texts from our family and friends about how much they loved the music and didn’t want to leave the party. SUCCESS!!! Nailed it! Even beyond the music, the little things are also a big deal. Brandon and his team were so professional, kind and exuded so much energy! They gave 10000% which made us feel cared for. We loved that this team was part of our day and we know we absolutely made the right choice. STOP SEARCHING! HIRE THEM NOW!
