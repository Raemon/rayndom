"The Etsy bride is someone who embraces individuality, whether that's through a breezy bohemian look, an elegant minimalist slip or a dramatic vintage puff-sleeve gown," says the platform's resident trend expert, [Dayna Isom Johnson](https://www.instagram.com/daynaisomjohnson/). An Etsy wedding dress isn't something you'd find in a catalog or on the runway; it's unique, often handmade or restored, and it tells a story. "Most of our brides are looking to put a personal touch on their attire, seeking looks that emphasize storytelling and meaning for the couple."

The key to shopping for wedding dresses from Etsy is finding a trusted seller and communicating with them every step of the way. Here, Isom Johnson helps us peg a few of the best Etsy wedding dress shops and offers some tips for buying a wedding dress on Etsy.

## Can You Buy Wedding Dresses on Etsy?

Yes, you can certainly buy wedding dresses—and wedding shoes, veils and accessories—on Etsy, and the platform offers a notable bang for your buck. "Etsy offers exceptional value and craftsmanship at a price point option for everyone, particularly those with moderate budgets," Isom Johnson says. "You can find everything from exquisite vintage gowns for a few hundred dollars to elaborate, highly custom gowns that represent a significant investment."

## How to Find the Best Wedding Dresses on Etsy 

Etsy wedding dresses range from restored vintage to sleek and modern, but regardless of what style you're looking for, there are a few hacks to finding it. Here, we outline the best practices for [buying a wedding dress online](https://www.theknot.com/content/virtual-shopping-guidelines-wedding-attire) via Etsy. A quick tip to start? "Keep an eye out for our 'Etsy's Picks,'" Isom Johnson says. "These are items that have been hand-selected by our in-house style experts for quality, reliability and elevated style."

### Nail the Keywords

When it comes to searching wedding dresses on Etsy, "keywords are absolutely your best friend," Isom Johnson says. "Terms like 'bohemian' and 'romantic' work brilliantly because they capture a specific aesthetic. But don't stop there: Get super specific about the details and dress elements you love. Try keywords based on silhouette, like 'A-line' or 'slip dress,' details like 'lace appliqué,' or even fabric like 'silk crepe.'" 

### Use Filters 

In addition to keywords, shoppers can use the built-in filters to narrow their search. "You can filter by everything from sizing and color to more specific design elements like hem length, sleeve length and silhouette," Isom Johnson says. This is particularly helpful if you have a specific vision in mind—but if you're open to different styles, simply filter by price to fit your budget (just note that dresses are sometimes more expensive than listed once customizations are factored in). 

### Read Reviews 

This is a hugely important step on the platform, where reviews are paramount to the success of any Etsy wedding dress shop. Dive in to see what other customers' experience was like, both in communication with the designer and in the quality of the final piece. **"** Once you narrow in on some shops, check their reviews and look at the photos brides have shared—it can give you an authentic look at the garment," Isom Johnson says. 

### Message the Seller 

"Most Etsy wedding dress sellers create gowns to order, meaning the back-and-forth communication is a natural and wonderful part of the process," Isom Johnson says. "Sellers will often initiate detailed conversations, requesting specific measurements, sharing fabric swatches for approval, and even sharing progress photos during construction. It's one of the best parts about shopping on Etsy—you get that human connection." Don't be afraid to inquire whether a piece can be made in a different fabric, hemmed into a [short wedding dress](https://www.theknot.com/content/short-simple-wedding-dresses), or any other alteration you might desire. 

### Plan Ahead 

With traditional wedding dresses, it's recommended to shop at least 9 to 12 months in advance of the wedding, if not more. You should stick to a similar timeline if you're shopping on Etsy. While some shops may offer quick delivery, truly custom pieces take time. "Always check the estimated processing and shipping times," Isom Johnson suggests (you can usually find this in the right-hand column, under item details). "Plan ahead, communicate with your seller and enjoy the magical process of finding something as unique as your love story!"

### Complete the Look

As with any wedding dress, the styling of a modern or [vintage-style wedding dress](https://www.theknot.com/content/vintage-style-wedding-dresses) is key—and Etsy is a one-stop shop. "Etsy is a treasure trove for accessories that complete your bridal moment," Isom Johnson says. "Think outside the box for items like bridal capes, oversized hair bows or personalized embroidered veils." 

### Have It Altered

Most custom Etsy wedding dress designers require you to send very specific measurements in order to craft a dress to the closest possible approximation of your body. Still, though, it will likely need some finishing touches, such as a hem to the length. "Final tailoring at a local seamstress is normal and recommended," Isom Johnsom says. 

### Leave a Review!

Lastly, if you love your final wedding dress, keep the love going. Good reviews on Etsy shops help engage new customers and bring more business, so if your experience was good, share it! 

## Etsy Wedding Dress Shops to Explore 

There are seemingly endless wedding dress storefronts on Etsy, which can be daunting. But, "we make it easy to identify the best of the best," Isom Johnson says. "Our Star Seller badge signals the shop has consistently achieved high standards for things like response time, on-time shipping and five-star reviews." Here are eight shops we recommend for buying wedding dresses on Etsy.

[**LilyMarksBrand**](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6220&awinaffid=565019&campaign=&clickref=Theknot.com-etsy-wedding-dresses&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fshop%2FLilyMarksBrand&platform=pl)**:** In just three years on Etsy, owner Ksenia has more than 2,000 wedding dress sales and hundreds of five-star reviews. She sends customers a detailed video on how to take their measurements, and uses those to create the made-to-order dresses, which are hand-sewn in her family workshop. The aesthetic is modern: some smooth and sleek, and others with floral appliqués, billowing sleeves or peekaboo lace detailing.

[**VagueAtelier**](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6220&awinaffid=565019&campaign=&clickref=Theknot.com-etsy-wedding-dresses&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fshop%2FVagueAtelier&platform=pl)**:** For an incredible selection of vintage wedding dresses on Etsy, check out this Star Seller based in Italy. Most of the shop's listings are one-of-one vintage pieces, like this incredible [silk organza strapless dress](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6220&awinaffid=565019&campaign=&clickref=Theknot.com-etsy-wedding-dresses&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Flisting%2F4380044633%2F318-organza-in-bloom-a-line-wedding&platform=pl) with oversized rosettes, or this tiered [sheer-skirt dress](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6220&awinaffid=565019&campaign=&clickref=Theknot.com-etsy-wedding-dresses&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Flisting%2F4376528890%2F315-pout-pourri-by-stili-vintage-sheath&platform=pl) from the 1990s.

[**TesoroSiNYC**](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6220&awinaffid=565019&campaign=&clickref=Theknot.com-etsy-wedding-dresses&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fshop%2FTesoroSiNYC&platform=pl)**:** Owner Hanna was formerly a dress tailor in Europe; now based in New York, she partners with European ateliers to sell their dresses in the US via Etsy. Look for stunning contemporary designs with a romantic feel, from a [draped satin dress](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6220&awinaffid=565019&campaign=&clickref=Theknot.com-etsy-wedding-dresses&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Flisting%2F1648116246%2Felegant-classic-satin-wedding-dress-with&platform=pl) with detachable sleeves and train to sexier sheer lace dresses and corseted two-piece styles. 

[**BLUSHFASHION**](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6220&awinaffid=565019&campaign=&clickref=Theknot.com-etsy-wedding-dresses&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fshop%2FBLUSHFASHION&platform=pl): This label out of Tel Aviv has more than 20,000 sales on Etsy and thousands of stellar reviews. Its dresses have a bohemian feel—think long bell sleeves, lots of lace and elements that flutter in the breeze. Plus, the [wedding dress cost](https://www.theknot.com/content/average-cost-of-wedding-dress) is great, with many styles falling under $1,000.

[**FaithCauvain**](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6220&awinaffid=565019&campaign=&clickref=Theknot.com-etsy-wedding-dresses&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fshop%2FFaithCauvain&platform=pl): This French designer was a finalist in the 2025 Etsy Design Awards and has a Star Seller badge. Her dresses are fresh and floral and have a touch of whimsy, like [this dress](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6220&awinaffid=565019&campaign=&clickref=Theknot.com-etsy-wedding-dresses&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Flisting%2F4323532723%2Fetsy-design-awards-2025-modern-boho&platform=pl) with a mesh floral bodice or this one with [pops of pink](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6220&awinaffid=565019&campaign=&clickref=Theknot.com-etsy-wedding-dresses&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Flisting%2F4356032848%2Fetsy-design-award-pink-and-white-wedding&platform=pl). Most styles are handmade and customizable. 

[**VivianEliseVintage**](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6220&awinaffid=565019&campaign=&clickref=Theknot.com-etsy-wedding-dresses&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fshop%2FVivianEliseVintage&platform=pl)**:** If you're looking to wear an ethical design for your wedding, opt for vintage. Shopowner Courtney Elise sources vintage pieces and lovingly restores them, including information about what decade they came from. Each dress is one-of-a-kind, meaning it only comes in one size, and the seller is transparent about whether there are stains or marks on it; but when you find that perfect piece, it feels like a true diamond in the rough. 

[**CaribisAtelierUA**](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6220&awinaffid=565019&campaign=&clickref=Theknot.com-etsy-wedding-dresses&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fshop%2FCaribisAtelierUA&platform=pl)**:** The Ukrainian designer specializes in corsets (currently topping just about every list of [wedding dress trends](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-dress-trends)), with a large selection available to order either on their own or as part of a wedding dress. Corsets are made to each shopper's size and specifications and can be rendered in black, white, beige or custom colors for the daring bride. 

[**HandmadeGarment**](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6220&awinaffid=565019&campaign=&clickref=Theknot.com-etsy-wedding-dresses&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fshop%2FHANDMADEGARMENT&platform=pl)**:** Started in Ukraine in 2017, this label offers not just wedding dresses but bridal suiting, getting-ready looks and even bridesmaid and Etsy wedding guest dresses. There's a notable collection of well-priced Mulberry silk slip dresses, a chic [cashmere skirt suit](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6220&awinaffid=565019&campaign=&clickref=Theknot.com-etsy-wedding-dresses&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Flisting%2F1825841168%2Foff-white-cashmere-skirt-suit-womens&platform=pl) we love for a rehearsal look, and a variety of classic, modern and vintage-leaning wedding dresses.
