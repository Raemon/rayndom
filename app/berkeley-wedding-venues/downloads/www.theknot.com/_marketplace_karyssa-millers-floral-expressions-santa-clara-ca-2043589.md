Karyssa Miller’s Floral Expressions - Artistic - Floral - Design Based in Santa Clara, CA, I specialize in providing floral arrangements for weddings and special events in the greater San Francisco Bay Area. Every arrangement should be unique and reflect your personality and style, ensuring that your big day is truly special. I offer fully customized floral estimates to cater to your specific needs and wants. I offer everything from bouquets, corsages, boutonnieres, and flower girl or boy accessories to centerpieces, cocktail hour, and bar decorations, not to mention flowers for the cake. I also offer altar or arch flowers, aisle decor, and anything else you can think of to make your special day even more magical. As an artistic colorist, I ensure you get the perfect pop of color or natural greenery that brings your floral arrangements to life. I have rental items for décor, such as wooden arches, candles, vases, string lights, lanterns, and small fabric for draping. My background in art and textiles is reflected in my distinct approach to floral arrangements. I studied at the Kansas City Art Institute in Missouri. I am a Master textile weaver, which means I handmake fabrics on a loom. I also have extensive experience in event management in the corporate world and bring consummate professionalism to my work. I have a background in event coordination.

Karyssa Miller

Owner

As an artist with a passion for floral design, I approach each arrangement with a unique and creative outlook. While I have the skill to create traditional floral displays, my true joy comes from crafting personalized and extraordinary pieces for my clients. I thrive on being innovative and infusing each creation with a fresh, imaginative perspective. I earned my Bachelor's in Fine Arts from the Kansas City Art Institute in Missouri, MO, with a double major in fiber and ceramics.

As soon as I first spoke with Karyssa, I knew I wanted her to be our florist. She immediately saw my vision, and she was able to fit everything we wanted into our relatively modest...

budget. I was so happy with her creations for the arch for the ceremony, our bouquets, and our centerpieces. The flowers were gorgeous and went so well with the rest of the landscaping. The ceremony site looked incredible. She was super communicative and took the initiative to reach out to us to check in, which I really appreciated. I would recommend Karyssa to anyone planning their wedding!

Karyssa is not only so incredibly talented, she is truly the sweetest person. I absolutely loved working/planning with her! Her attention to detail, organization, thoughtfulness, a...

nd professionalism made each of our meetings so effective yet easy. I'm by no means a floral expert so I really leaned on Karyssa's professional advice when it came to which flowers to pick or what looked well together based on my inspiration photos. She brought my vision for my wedding to life, but far beyond what I thought was possible. She was able to bring even the smallest details to life in the most beautiful ways. Not only did she create stunning bouquets and boutonnieres for our wedding party, but she set up our reception room with all of our decor. It was stunning, and by far my husband and my favorite part of our whole wedding day. I can’t recommend Karyssa enough!! Not only does her pricing blow her competitors out of the water, but her patience and fun made her my favorite vendor to work with :)

During our initial consultation, Karyssa took the time to listen to our vision and ideas for our wedding day, and she worked closely with us to bring that vision to life. She offered helpful suggestions and guidance along the way, while always remaining flexible and open to our input. On the day of the wedding, the floral arrangements were simply stunning. From the bouquets to the centerpieces, every detail was executed flawlessly. Our guests were in awe of the beautiful flowers and greenery that adorned the venue. Not only were the flowers gorgeous, but the level of service we received from Karyssa was top-notch. She was always professional, prompt, and easy to communicate with throughout the entire process. It was clear that she truly cared about making our day special and memorable. Overall, I would highly recommend Karyssa Miller's Floral Expressions to anyone in need of a talented and reliable wedding florist.
