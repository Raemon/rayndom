### About this venue

Kunde Family Winery in Kenwood, CA On your California wedding day in Sonoma Valley, you can celebrate with family and friends in one of a number of stylish indoor and outdoor event spaces. Rolling vineyards and tall oaks define the countryside and provide a scenic background for your post-ceremony photographs. Among aging caves and barrel rooms, you will dine and dance with your loved ones, creating one unforgettable moment after another. A Brief Glance at The Kunde Family After acquiring what was then known as Wildwood Vineyards ranch, Louis Kunde founded the Kunde Family Winery in 1904. Before his passing in 1922, he bequeathed ownership to his son Arthur, who steered the business through the difficult Prohibition years and the Second World War. Arthur's sons would eventually take ownership, and the business would grow stronger to where it is today, with 4th and 5th-generation Kunde family members still operating the estate and tending to the farm. The Intimate Caves or the Elegant Boot Hill Depending on the size of your guest list, you can take your party on a journey through the Aging Caves or fall in love as one with Boot Hill's sweeping vineyard views. The Caves is a more intimate location with a capacity of 50, while the spacious Boot Hill can accommodate 250 people. Two further venues, Winemaker's Plaza (capacity of 200) and Magnolia Room (also 200), enable you to celebrate both indoors and outdoors. Imagine that first dance as newlyweds, while the skies fill with stars and the moonlight creates a spotlight on you and your partner. Pictured it? Good. Now you can get in contact with Melissa Harper and begin planning your dream wedding day.

This location is beautiful! My husband and I got married there a month ago at Boot Hill, and guests were amazed at the scenery. The panoramic views of the vineyard made the event f...

eel intimate. Even though it was the hottest day of the year at that point, the many oak trees provided shade and the evening breeze gave plenty of relief. Everyone at Kunde was a joy to work with, the wines were delicious, and really that view can not be rivaled.

We were at Boot Hill and it was absolutely the perfect place to get married! The views are stunning and make it so that there is very little that you have to decorate, they even h...

ad bistro lighting. How can you beat huge oak trees, sweeping views of vines, and beautiful lighting. Everyone was in awe of the place. Not only is the place pretty, but the people there are fun to work with and certainly know how to make you feel special. Melissa was a blessing. She helped in ways that I never expected and made the planning process fun. Melissa gave us some recommendations for our other vendors and she was spot on, everyone she suggested was great, and loved her too. We made sure to go to Kunde a few times before the wedding, partly to pick out our wine since you use their wine, and it was relaxing and fun. Melissa was always ready for us. The day of the wedding the girls got to get ready in the house there, which is huge, and Melissa drove the girls up to the site (we wanted this). Kunde was truly spectacular.
