I had my initial (and very first!) wedding dress appointment at Grace Loves Lace and brought my sister and best friend. I went into the appointment admittedly nervous about it all,...

but right from the start Jazmynn and her trainee McKenzie were INCREDIBLE. Immediately my nerves were eased by their kind, open and calm demeanor. I was so impressed by how nothing felt rushed (we went way over the 1 hour timeslot) because they truly cared so much about helping me into and out of each gown and letting me take my time trying each on. Not only were they kind, but SO complimentary and really hyped me up in the dresses I loved. I felt so comfortable the entire time, and honestly am now scared to go anywhere else as I know it won't be as great of an experience. I couldn't recommend this location more, I can't wait to go back for another fitting!!!

nufactured. The dresses were marginal quality- many had swimsuit-like cups built into the bra and many samples were worn down from use. They also don't use clips to fit the samples to you so it's hard to visualize your dress when many are falling off. I unfortunately did not feel sexy or comfortable or wowed during my experience.
