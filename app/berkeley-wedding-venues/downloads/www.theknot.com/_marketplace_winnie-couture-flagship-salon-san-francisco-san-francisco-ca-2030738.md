stunning dresses drew me in, and the designs are phenomenal! This was my first visit to a boutique, and I am extremely glad and grateful to have discovered them! I was given a lovely and very kind stylist, and I adore her personality and how helpful she was, from selecting dresses to assisting me in putting them on! She gave me her undivided attention and seemed to understand exactly what I was looking for. All of the dresses I tried on were reasonably priced and budget-friendly. I'm on a tight budget, and I didn't go over my initial budget, which is incredible. Finally, I chose the Hazelyn dress because it fits me perfectly, and I believe I instantly turned into a princess. Lol I am overjoyed that I found the dress and thrilled with the entire experience. I wholeheartedly recommend them!

I honestly had trouble choosing just one wedding dress, which I believe is a nice problem to have. My experience with Winnie Couture was wonderful! I had the most wonderful wedding I have dreamed of! I will keep referring them to my friends. If you're thinking about going to any bridal salon, I'd contact and arrange an appointment right away with Winnie Couture!

lpless until my friend mentioned about Winnie Couture, so we went to their website and fell in love with the designs! They have so many styles of their wedding gowns and I had a lot of options so I could not find easily what to wear. A great thanks to my stylist for being so professional. In the end, I was able to have my dream wedding dress and it was indeed a great shopping experience with Winnie Couture. They genuinely care about me, and I am grateful for their sincerity. So, if you're a future bride, don't waste time and come here first! Thank you for your assistance and love, Winnie Couture.

histicated showroom, which was filled with the most exquisitely chosen collection of their wedding dresses. Working with my stylist was the real highlight of our time there. She has captivating energy, a happy outlook that makes everything better, and extensive knowledge of wedding gowns. I believe I had five wedding dresses all throughout the process. She carefully considered my choices and responses to each, and as she absorbed my comments, she went to grab another gown that was really perfect for me. The process was enjoyable, fruitful, and stress-free. We never anticipated finding my gown in a single day here at Winnie Couture. We are so thankful to Winnie Couture and would highly recommend to any future brides.

Let me share to you all my experience with Winnie Couture. I anticipated that finding a wedding dress would take a long time, and I was correct. If I recall right, I visited more ...

than three stores, but neither the wedding dresses nor the service fully satisfied me; they're all terrible! With barely six months till my wedding, I realized I needed to move swiftly or risk buying something less than ideal. I needed to get things done as soon as possible. When I found Winnie Couture, I then hurriedly booked an appointment with them. My stylists made certain that everything looked fantastic. I can't express how lovely they genuinely were. Everything was perfect and a wonderful experience from start to finish. I did really love my wedding dress and I'll be eternally grateful to Winnies.

across Winnie Couture! The store is very welcoming and my stylist was friendly and excellent at understanding. Instead of just trying to push a sale, she seemed sincere in helping me find the wedding dress of my dreams. I experienced a great deal of comfort, which I hadn't had at prior appointments. When we finally found my wedding dress, I was ecstatic! I would highly recommend Winnie Couture to any bride looking for a beautiful wedding dress and an unforgettable experience!

of those girls who daydreamed about wearing a wedding gown. LMAO! I visited Winnie Couture's website after hearing about them from a friend, and as soon as I did, I was attracted to each and every dress they have. I needed something like their designs, and they had it! By far the most beautiful bridal boutique I've ever seen, with excellent customer service. We had a lovely day at Winnie Couture and were treated like royalty throughout. I found my dress and had a wonderful wedding. 😊 Winnie Couture you’re the best! A highly recommended store. 5 Starssss!!! XOXO

was bored with my gown hunt and had almost given up hope- until I got here! My bridal consultant was lovely, kind, and helpful!

I cannot express how great my experience was! Highly recommended!

I DO NOT recommend purchasing your dress from here and if you do, put your emotions aside and examine your gown from head to toe, seam to seam. Bring your seamstress to the shop wi...

th you if possible. I purchased the Winslet dress in Nov 2021 and paid a 1 month rush fee of $234.45+tax. I received the dress in April and when I tried it on, I was ecstatic! I trusted the associates that all was fine so I took it home. I opted for the hollow to hem measurement so I was expecting to only take it in at the waist. The associates at the store also agreed that this is probably all I needed to do. When I tried on the unaltered gown for my seamstress, who's super experienced by the way (15+ years working only on bridal gowns), the first thing she said to me was, "One side of your neckline is crooked." WHAT?! I looked where she was pointing and sure enough, it was crooked. My dress is a V-neck so the V needs to be perfect because it's basically the center of attention. I snapped a bunch of photos and compared it to the gown that I tried on in store when I bought the dress. There's definitely something wrong with my gown. I immediately brought this to Rakhi Patel's (sales person at Winnie Couture) attention via text message with photos. She tried to assure me that it's because the dress is brand new and with some steaming and time and also, once it's altered to fit my body, the fabric will soften and the neckline will straighten out. This makes no sense because why is the dress that I purchased brand new, not already in its perfect shape when it was handed to me? I understand that the sizing is incorrect, but it doesn't make sense that when it sits on the body, it'll be crooked. After some back and forth, I consulted my seamstress again and she confirmed that it's not a fabric softness issue and even if she tried to fix it, it won't be perfect. This was unacceptable. After more back and forth, first, Winnie Couture said they would cover the alterations for the neckline and refund the rush fee. Eventually, Rakhi said she would send a new dress and they would cover the cost to alter it to be like my current dress. The new dress was delivered directly to my seamstress on May 21. I met the seamstress on May 24 to try on the new dress. The seamstress confirmed that the dress's neckline was also crooked on the new dress. She also confirmed that even if the dress was ok, it would take too much time and cost significantly more to alter it to be the same as my current dress. For this reason, I had no choice but to accept the original dress that I was given. Note, my wedding was on July 30 and I was panicking because I wasn't sure if there'll be enough time to fix it the way I wanted it. Since the original solution that Winnie Couture proposed didn't work and was going to cost the company much more, I requested that the entire cost of my dress alteration be covered instead. I also requested that the 1 month rush fee that I paid be refunded. Ultimately, Winnie Couture covered the full alteration cost of the dress, but REFUSED to refund the rush fee. Their argument was that the dress arrived on time. Yes, the dress arrived on time, BUT it wasn't PERFECT. If I paid for a product to arrive earlier, but it arrived with flaws, this doesn't mean it arrived earlier!! You sent me a bad apple on time, not the perfect one I bought. It's been 4 months and I still haven't received my refund for the rush fee. I expected more from a brand like Winnie Couture.
