## Most Popular Wedding Flowers

These are the all-time most popular wedding flowers, according to The Knot research. Any of these [wedding flower ideas](https://www.theknot.com/content/unique-wedding-flower-ideas) would look beautiful, whether you're searching for types of flowers for wedding bouquets, boutonnieres or reception centerpieces. There's a reason these pretty wedding flowers are the most commonly used varieties—they're all absolutely stunning. Here are the wedding flower names you need to know:

FEATURED VIDEO FROM THE KNOT

### 1\. Rose

![A beautiful and romantic peach-toned rose](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/828dcd4e-dabb-4b13-9e15-6ab5909c982f~rs_768.h-cr_0.147.1875.1553)

What's the most popular flower used in weddings? A romantic rose of course. Roses are beautiful, fragrant and versatile, which contributes to their status. From their use in many [different types of wedding bouquets](https://www.theknot.com/content/a-glossary-of-bouquets-and-wedding-flowers) to dramatic ceremony arches, there's room for roses in just about every part of a wedding. 

"A rose is a timelessly beautiful bloom with different shapes and qualities: standard, spray and the super-romantic garden shapes," says Hunter. "They're available in a really wide variety of colors and are fairly robust, even on warmer event days." The flower comes in myriad hues including orange, pink, purple, red, white and yellow.

[Rose Bouquets to Have & Hold](https://https://www.theknot.com/content/rose-wedding-bouquet)

### 2\. Ranunculus

![A dreamy pink ranunculus](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/a4d96863-6c62-4529-b701-092084114207~rs_768.h-cr_0.247.1875.1653)

_Photography: Jamie Chung,__Styling: Sarah Smart,__Art Direction: Sarah Evans_

Ranunculus is one of the most beloved types of wedding flowers because of how lush the botanical's petal structure is. "I feel like I can stare at ranunculus blooms and lose track of time," says Hunter. "They're romantic, quintessentially spring-y and have a sheen to the petals that really makes their colors unique. The color options range from white and soft pastels to highly saturated hot colors, and they perform well in no-water applications like boutonnieres and corsages."

A standard ranunculus is seen here, but butterfly ranunculus, which has a more open petal structure, is another popular variety. Beyond coming in a few different shape varieties, ranunculus comes in a range of colors including burgundy, peach, pink, red, white and yellow.

### 3\. Peony

![A dreamy white peony](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/1f33744f-ae05-46d2-8193-fc9713041902~rs_768.h-cr_0.147.1875.1553)

_Photography: Jamie Chung,__Styling: Sarah Smart,__Art Direction: Sarah Evans_

If you want a voluminous, lush flower with cloud-like petals, then the peony is your ideal type of wedding flower. Although the flower can be pricey and hard to procure because it has a limited growing season, it isn't hard to see why so many couples believe it is one of the best wedding flowers. 

"Peony is just the quintessential bridal flower. It's large and fragrant," says Hunter. An especially popular variety of peonies is the coral charm peony, identifiable by the bloom's yellow center. Peonies will work well in most of your [wedding bouquet ideas](https://www.theknot.com/content/unique-wedding-bouquet-ideas), but we also love to see them used in low reception centerpieces.

[Pretty Peony Bouquets](https://www.theknot.com/content/peony-wedding-bouquet)

### 4\. Hydrangea

![A gorgeous, cloud-like white hydrangea](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/6d099c67-3f3c-403f-a750-28eca52be3cf~rs_768.h-cr_0.420.1875.1826)

_Photography: Jamie Chung,__Styling: Sarah Smart,__Art Direction: Sarah Evans_

Hydrangea is another popular wedding flower if you want something full and pillowy. White hydrangeas are often used as flowers for bridal bouquets, but the botanical comes in blue, pink, purple and green as well, which look stunning in flower installations, like arches and flower wall backdrops. Additionally, they're associated with New England coastal summers, so preppy couples, take note.

[Hot Hydrangea Bouquets](https://www.theknot.com/content/hydrangeas-wedding-bouquets)

### 5\. Dahlia

![Romantic pink dahlia flower](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/633d145d-3dcd-4d56-b324-8a57e441a3a6~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1000.750)

_[Liron Erel & Co.](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/callie-hobbs-photography-denver-co-763698)_

It's not hard to see why dahlias are a popular wedding flower. Their lush petal structure is stunning and the amazing wedding flower type comes in a variety of colors and species to fit any couple and any wedding style. Cactus and pompon dahlias are two especially popular types of wedding flowers.

"Dahlia is my absolute favorite flower," says Hunter. "They come in a very wide range of colors, from subtle pastels to mixed color petals that seem iridescent or layered, and really richly saturated deep colors as well. There are many plant breeding enthusiasts who specialize in dahlia growing, so there are constantly more special colors and shapes of blooms becoming available. They also do not ship well, which makes them all the more special to harvest and design with as a locally grown flower."

[Dahlia Bouquets That Slay](https://https://www.theknot.com/content/dahlia-wedding-bouquet)

### 6\. Calla Lily

![Dreamy white calla lily](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/a154f2ab-599f-4304-bd59-84bcf213b675~rs_768.h-cr_0.264.1875.1670)

_Photography: Jamie Chung,__Styling: Sarah Smart,__Art Direction: Sarah Evans_

Known for their trumpet-like shape, calla lilies are an iconic option for minimalist couples. They work especially well in bouquets for to-be-weds who want a long-stemmed option. And they come in an array of colors from maroon to pink, white and yellow.

### 7\. Gardenia

![A gardenia boutonniere on the lapel of a neutral-toned suit](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/f03dbc78-dff4-4b6c-9f1b-e7b43e89463e~rs_768.h-cr_0.227.675.733)

_[Jillian Rose Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/jillian-rose-photography-westlake-village-ca-768116)_

Gardenias are a great choice for personal arrangements, like boutonnieres and corsages, because they smell divine. But if you have guests or loved ones who are sensitive to smell, these flowers should be used sparingly.

[Gardenia Bouquets, This Way](https://www.theknot.com/content/gardenia-wedding-bouquet)

### 8\. Orchid

![Gorgeous tangerine-colored orchid flowers](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/8edcf33e-3adb-4105-9c87-1723b89fb8b5~rs_768.h-cr_0.347.1875.1753)

_Photography: Jamie Chung,__Styling: Sarah Smart,__Art Direction: Sarah Evans_

There are many varieties of orchids, all of which are beautiful and could be considered as flowers for wedding bouquets and arrangements. Dendrobium orchids are one of the most popular varieties of this eye-catching bloom. If your color palette includes purple, white or yellow, then consider orchids as wedding flowers.

_Photography: Jamie Chung,__Styling: Sarah Smart,__Art Direction: Sarah Evans_

Protea are a fun and dramatic wedding flower that has gained popularity over the last few years. A king protea is seen here, but pincushion proteas are another popular variety of wedding flowers. Protea is a good type of wedding flower if you have a bold color palette filled with shades of orange, pink or red.

[Punchy Protea Bouquets](https://www.theknot.com/content/protea-wedding-bouquet)

### 10\. Lilac

![A purple lilac flower arrangement](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/7089e314-4074-4cd9-b441-c91ba237b802~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1000.750)

_[Amy & Jordan Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/amy-and-jordan-photography-scottsdale-az-564599)_

Similar in appearance to hydrangeas, lilac is a great option for purple-loving couples. Lilac is a great type of wedding flower because it adds height and structure to wedding flower arrangements. Additionally, lilac is a fragrant wedding flower and a nice option if you want to scentscape the wedding day.

[Lovely Lilac Bouquets](https://www.theknot.com/content/lilac-wedding-bouquets)

### 11\. Lily of the Valley

![A petite lily of the valley bouquet tied with a white ribbon](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/fa6fa600-4ff3-4fd5-a5ba-40a671db1974~rs_768.h-cr_0.36.750.599)

_[Laura Gordon Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/laura-gordon-photography-richmond-va-559656)_

Also known as andromeda, this petite bloom is the preferred choice of British royals. While not technically a member of the lily family, lily of the valley is a popular wedding flower type nonetheless. In addition to being a good flower for wedding bouquets, the small blooms look great in boutonnieres as well.

### 12\. Anemone

![A stunning rosy-peach anemone flower](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/db733198-9d68-4c49-8a5e-ffd22178e832~rs_768.h-cr_0.277.1875.1683)

_Photography: Jamie Chung,__Styling: Sarah Smart,__Art Direction: Sarah Evans_

Anemones are delicate flowers that come in a variety of colorways and are easily identifiable by their black centers. Many to-be-weds chose anemones as wedding flowers because of this dramatic and eye-catching center, which look great at modern weddings. You're probably most familiar with white anemones that have a black center, but anemones also come in berry, purple and red.

[Eye-Catching Anemone Bouquets](https://www.theknot.com/content/anemone-bouquet)

### 13\. Tulip

![A romantic pink and pale yellow tulip](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/69289d0c-471c-4982-9af2-ccc5de9adad6~rs_768.h-cr_0.304.1875.1710)

_Photography: Jamie Chung,__Styling: Sarah Smart,__Art Direction: Sarah Evans_

"Tulips are wonderful because they come in a wide variety of colors," says Hunter. "They also are available in some really stunning double or peony-shape blooms for specialty work. We also sometimes will reflex their petals for a unique, ethereal effect."

![A wedding flower girl with a baby's breath flower crown](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/2c6798fe-8fdc-4d98-8781-057f7f32862f~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.750.563)

_[Molly Lichten Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/molly-lichten-photography-pasadena-ca-818836)_

Baby's breath was long used as simply a filler, but in recent years, more and more florists have taken to using the fluffy white flower to create dramatic installations. Although the popular wedding flower is naturally white, many floral designers will spray paint the botanical to use it with a unique color palette.

_[Lindsay Hackney Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/lindsay-hackney-photography-portsmouth-nh-994695)_

Carnations are [affordable wedding flowers](https://www.theknot.com/content/top-ten-inexpensive-flowers) that are hearty enough to be used in a variety of ways. Similar in appearance to marigolds, carnations are often included in Indian wedding decorations.

Hunter mentions that she loves carnations for their versatility: "They grow in a zillion different colors, including some really special antique-y tones that work really well for the subtle creamy or muddy tones that are so popular in wedding work. They're also super resilient to heat, so they still look great even on the most sweltering days."

[Cutie Carnation Bouquets](https://www.theknot.com/content/carnation-wedding-bouquet)

### 16\. Sweet Pea

![Sweet Pea florals](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/a85db342-e519-41a4-a75b-cd76788d7e3d~rs_768.h-cr_0.16.1158.1560)

Sweet pea is an incredibly popular wedding bouquet flower, but because it's fragile, it needs to be treated with care. If you're considering this flower for your wedding bouquet, talk with your florist about how you can include it and ensure the arrangement is durable.

"Sweet pea is intoxicatingly fragrant, delicate and romantic, and evokes a bit of grandma's garden in the best possible way," says Hunter.

### 17\. Anthurium

![Man holding a bouquet of Anthurium flowers](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/5dd22925-4f23-40c9-b6b4-de61b3b92502~rs_768.h-cr_0.33.1094.1492)

Want a unique and bold type of wedding flower? Anthurium is just the botanical you should consider. This popular wedding flower has a distinct look consisting of a waxy heart-shaped petal and prominent stamen. The flower is great for tropical and beach weddings.

"It's shiny, large and unique," says Hunter of the tropical bloom. "It signals luxury anywhere that it's included."

### 18\. Amaranthus

![Fresh Amaranthus bouquet](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/397556af-6a71-4e9d-a7d4-31ef1f55310b~rs_768.h-cr_0.35.1080.1475)

_[Photo: Callaway Gable](https://callawaygable.com/),__[Photo: The Velvet Poppy](https://www.the-velvet-poppy.com/)_

If you've always dreamed about a cascading wedding bouquet or arrangement, then consider this popular wedding flower that's definitely trending. Amaranthus is made up of dense clusters of flowers on weeping vine-like stems that drape and waterfall gracefully.

"We're seeing a ton of it on Pinterest boards for this coming season and we're here for it," says Hunter. "It's textural, the green is a beautiful icy-olivey color and the rose and burgundy tones are gorgeous. It just adds drama to anything you put it in."

### 19\. Marigold

![Marigold table decor](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/f13863a7-3b62-41a5-958b-6503b3fcb591~rs_768.h-cr_0.91.1094.1550)

_[Photo: Cassie Valente Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/cassie-valente-photography-san-francisco-ca-ca-1019089),__Flowers: Acme Floral Co_

Yellow and orange marigold flowers are popular at Indian weddings. The flowers are affordable and durable, making them a good choice for garlands and installations.

Hunter says: "Marigold seems to have been on a steady rise over the last couple of seasons. It works well in lush farm-to-vase style designs as well as mono-bloom work. They're also classically used in flower strings, which we love. They're robust and heat tolerant, and available in the most vibrant orange and yellows as well as softer, more romantic ivory."

### 20\. Daisy

![Daisy table decor](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/1f0aba7a-13b0-4b63-916d-8171a2222882~rs_768.h-cr_0.182.1094.1641)

Even if you aren't a flower aficionado, you likely know what a daisy looks like. Daisies are not only a popular type of wedding flowers, but they're commonly used in everyday arrangements as well because they're affordable and beautiful, which is a winning combo. (P.S.

_[Lizzie and Marco](https://lizzieandmarco.com)_

Astilbe is a great filler flower. While it's similar in color to amaranthus, its shape is the complete opposite of amaranthus. Astilbe, also referred to as false goat's beard and false spirea, has a strong stem with bright plume-like flowers.

### Astrantia

![A romantic bouquet of astrantia flowers](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/617e9b09-ae75-4f77-aaec-0de25ae1d591~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1000.750)

Why does this popular wedding flower bear an avian moniker? Because it almost looks like a bird with its beak-like structure. If you're planning a modern tropical wedding and looking for good wedding flowers that are also a little edgy, this is the bloom for you.

### Black-Eyed Susan

![Summery and friendly black-eyed susan flowers](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/e39fe82e-0431-472a-8719-7ed538fa6762~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1000.750)

_[Julie Nicole](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/julie-nicole-lodi-ca-359071)_

_[Photography: Off BEET Productions](https://offbeetproductions.com/),__[Floral Design: Faye and Renee](https://www.fayeandrenee.com/)_

Chrysanthemums are similar to dahlias with their abundance of petals. But chrysanthemums differ in that they're easier to procure and more affordable than dahlias. Pink, yellow and orange are popular shades for this type of wedding flower.

### Clematis

![A wedding bouquet with purple clematis flowers](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/3fc4d882-b562-401a-a9c5-56dd776222a7~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1000.750)

_[Laura Watson Photography](https://lauraannewatson.com)_

Clematis is fairly fragile when it comes to kinds of flowers for a wedding, so it's best used in stationary arrangements, like centerpieces. The popular wedding flower is identifiable by its single layer of pointed purple petals.

### Cornflower

![An autumnal bouquet with cornflower blooms](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/4d034531-43d9-41f3-9c0e-a0176c3bd92b~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1000.750)

_[Heidi Ulman Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/heidi-uhlman-photography-chicago-il-1089029)_

Yet another great wildflower wedding bouquet bloom, cornflower is a bright blue flowering plant native to Europe. Not many flowers come in blue, so cornflower is a good wedding flower option if you're looking to infuse blue into your color palette and decor.

### Cosmo

![A romantic wine-colored cosmo flower boutonniere](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/f7583be1-5341-4895-abb1-37965a17fb49~rs_768.h-cr_0.143.4480.3503)

_[Photography: Alicia Wiley Photography](https://www.aliciawileyphotography.com/),__Floral Design: Loblolly Organic Farm_

Cosmos look like pink daisies. The flowering plant, which is related to sunflowers, is one of the nicest types of flowers for a wedding. This is especially so if you're planning a casual wedding and want rustic, simple flowers.

_[Photography: LINCZAK PHOTOGRAPHY](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/linczak-photography-summerville-sc-316070),__Floral design: SWEET ARRANGEMENTS_

Like tulips, daffodils are one of the best flowers for weddings for spring couples. With their vertical petals and trumpet-like center, this popular wedding flower is hard to miss.

### Delphinium (Larkspur)

![A pink delphinium flower arrangement as a wedding ceremony aisle decoration](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/7b6ccb49-c41b-45d5-8202-fc077a1508fe~rs_768.h-cr_0.317.750.880)

_[Michael Radford Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/michael-radford-photography-yorba-linda-ca-763548)_

Delphinium, or larkspur, is a good wedding flower to use in aisle arrangements because it has strong, tall stems that add structure to any arrangement. The most common color for delphinium is blue, but it can also be procured in pink, white and purple. Despite being a popular wedding flower, delphinium is poisonous to humans and animals so it should be avoided if you have lots of your children or dogs attending.

### Dogwood

![Romantic flowering dogwood branches](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/7423f20d-8375-4f30-9926-4f3152dade1c~rs_768.h-cr_0.230.675.736)

_[Amanda Watson Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/amanda-watson-photography-oklahoma-city-ok-768934)_

One of the most classic types of flowers for weddings in the South, dogwood blossoms are readily recognizable by their green centers and four white petals with notches at the edges. Because dogwood blooms grow on branches, this popular wedding flower works well in installations.

### Flannel Flower

![An invitation styled with flannel flower blooms](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/1842cd1b-7172-40b9-a6d0-ae79a1910605~rs_768.h-cr_0.41.750.604)

Although Miranda Priestly famously hated on freesia in the movie _The Devil Wears Prada_ , this flower is actually one of the more famous wedding flowers. Freesia blooms grow in a unique curved manner along the plant's stalk.

### Goldenrod

![A bride holding a yellow bouquet of craspedia and goldenrod flowers](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/1cf4bf6a-91d9-44f9-9961-867ba430d1cf~rs_768.h-cr_0.329.750.892)

_[Whims and Joys](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/whims-and-joy-minneapolis-mn-986231)_

### Hellebore

![A romantic and dreamy hellebore flower](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/a5559f5d-7a91-4788-b660-1b5719cad48b~rs_768.h-cr_0.350.1875.1756)

_Photography: Jamie Chung,__Styling: Sarah Smart,__Art Direction: Sarah Evans_

Hellebore is a great winter wedding flower if you want something moodier, rather than typical pink or red wedding flowers. Hellebore comes in black, green and purple. It looks great in corsages and boutonnieres.

### Hyacinth

![A wedding bouquet with beige roses and white hyacinth flowers](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/eafc3b4d-01de-444f-8c22-7012321c4ef8~rs_768.h-cr_0.117.750.680)

_[Love and Covenant Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/love-and-covenant-photography-inc-tampa-fl-1045419)_

Similar in appearance to lilac, hyacinth is a small plant with bulbous clusters of colorful blooms. Hyacinth comes in blush, pink and purple. Surprisingly, hyacinth is closely related to asparagus.

### Jasmine

![Jasmine flower recessional natural confetti](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/68eefcd4-2944-4bb8-914f-4bcb689d45f4~rs_768.h-cr_0.580.1080.1390)

We love seeing couples include jasmine in their wedding plans because the popular wedding flower is marked by a beautiful, subtle scent. Many couples use jasmine buds to toss during the ceremony recessional, as they're soft enough not to cause any harm but fragrant enough to enhance the scene.

### Iris

![A church altar arrangement with purple iris flowers](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/d831946b-48a8-46c4-87e0-777e35b490d8~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1000.750)

_[Craig Paulson Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/craig-paulson-studio-new-york-ny-124836)_

_[J & N Studios](https://www.jandnstudios.com)_

Like jasmine, lavender is fragrant and a great option to use for a grand-exit petal toss. Since lavender buds are so small, consider scooping lavender into cones for guests to easily hold beforehand.

### Lily

![Gorgeous peach-colored lilies](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/a34fad1e-116a-4d12-9051-5c362c179ef7~rs_768.h-cr_61.0.1033.729)

Lilies are a popular wedding bouquet flower because they come in many varieties and colors, so there's almost surely an option that will match your aesthetic. Stargazer and tiger lilies are two especially popular types of this wedding flower.

### Lisianthus

_[Photography: Lauren Larsen Studio](https://www.laurenlarsen.com/),__[Floral Design: Designs by Ahn](https://www.designsbyahn.com/)_

### Muscari

_[Liz Banfield Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/liz-banfield-photography-minneapolis-mn-306799)_

Muscari is like a miniature version of lilac. Muscari is a petite blue flower made up of a small vertical cluster of bell-shaped blooms.

### Narcissus Paperwhite

![A blue bud vase filled with white narcissus paperwhite flowers](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/bdf58eaa-22e3-4df4-8024-785690451bb3~rs_768.h-cr_0.154.736.706)

_[Adelyn Boling Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/adelyn-boling-photography-raleigh-nc-1070370)_

Related to daffodils, narcissus paperwhites are kinds of wedding flowers that are smaller and, you guessed it, white in color. If you like the shape of daffodils but don't want yellow flowers, then this popular wedding flower is a solid alternative.

### Nasturtium

![Four-tier blue wedding cake decorated with orange nasturtium blooms](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/73036ffe-5926-4fe3-8e84-b52aae52912c~rs_768.h-cr_0.39.750.602)

_[J & N Studios](https://www.jandnstudios.com)_

Unlike delphinium which is poisonous, nasturtium is one of the few popular wedding flowers you can eat. Because of this, nasturtium is often used to decorate wedding cakes.

### Passionflower

![A bud vase with ranunculus and passionflower blooms beside pillar candle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/fea5f211-23d5-488e-baa5-05eb0215a342~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1000.750)

_[The de Jaureguis](https://www.thedejaureguis.com)_

Passionflower looks like it belongs in a sci-fi movie. Passionflower blooms have purple petals, squiggly purple needle-like tendrils and point green middles. Few popular wedding flowers are as unique as passionflower in appearance.

### Plumeria

![Two-tier wedding cake with monstera leaves and plumeria flowers](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/e29d894b-3861-41a9-9520-228df9a62c05~rs_768.h-cr_0.255.750.818)

_[Nathan English Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/nathan-english-photography-grand-rapids-mi-372527)_

Like amaryllis, poinsettia is a great flower for Christmas weddings. Poinsettias are poisonous to animals so the plant should be avoided if you're including a dog on the big day. Poinsettias are commonly red, but they also come in white and pink.

### Poppy

![A wedding flower arrangement with orange Icelandic poppies](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/bb89c012-51fa-4e6d-855f-5d86e88412df~rs_768.h-cr_0.219.750.782)

_[Outland Weddings](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/outland-weddings-dallas-tx-962244)_

Although they're beautiful, poppies are fragile so you should work with your professional wedding florist to discuss the best way to include them in the wedding. Icelandic poppies are especially popular with weddings because of their dainty parchment-like petals that come in colors ranging from orange to pink, white and yellow.

### Pansy

![Farm table with rustic cake decorated with pansy blooms](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/07c11b4b-7e09-484b-9c35-ad6304a9d5a0~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1000.750)

### Queen Anne's Lace

![Chinoiserie vase with Queen Anne's lace](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/6cd572dc-26c7-4aa7-a6a1-ed4c3eda91a5~rs_768.h-cr_0.144.750.707)

### Scabiosa

![Flatlay with engagement rings and pink scabiosa blooms ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/43528002-2225-4a74-a923-350c125c284a~rs_768.h-cr_0.48.750.611)

### Snapdragon

![White and green snapdragon flower bouquets](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/5e9f1bc2-151f-4d9a-9c25-a62d4ad4cac3~rs_768.h-cr_61.0.1033.729)

Snapdragons can sometimes be confused with foxgloves because of the verticality of the plant. However, foxglove blooms are bell-shaped, while snapdragon blooms have a more ruffled appearance. Snapdragon wedding flowers are available in pink, orange and yellow.

### Stephanotis

![A bride holding stephanotis wedding bouquet](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/1e6b6908-a7cd-4a8b-9cf4-9f1c9818c052~rs_768.h-cr_0.219.750.782)

_[The Day by Ire Lippke](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/the-day-by-ira-lippke-new-york-ny-135353)_

Stephanotis is a very small bloom that is sometimes called Madagascar jasmine, but it's not actually related to common jasmine (which is part of the olive family). Because of its miniature nature, stephanotis works great in boutonnieres.

### Stock

![Ceremony aisle marker flower arrangement with stock, eucalyptus and rose](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/13ce0259-61b1-454a-9243-ad1cef84f122~rs_768.h-cr_0.111.750.674)

Stock flowers closely resemble snapdragons and work well to add volume to wedding flower arrangements. White stock is most commonly used in weddings, but stock also comes in pink and purple.

### Sunflower

_[Caitlin Alohilani Photography](https://www.caitlinalohilani.com)_

Looking for the best wedding flower for a rustic wedding? Enter: sunflowers. Sunflowers are a popular wedding flower because they're very sturdy and can withstand the wear and tear of a long, hot wedding day.

### Thistle

![A white bud vase with blue thistles ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/a55aef9d-5271-42c6-a736-9bbd04c65bac~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1000.750)

### Tweedia

_[DOLA Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/dola-photography-philadelphia-pa-606024)_

Veronica closely resembles celosia with its finger-like flowering spikes. The plant is also known as speedwells and comes in a few colorways, but purple is the most popular for weddings.

### Viburnum

![White viburnum flower arrangements](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/38299305-7784-4c9e-a67f-57cc491937e8~rs_768.h-cr_0.163.1094.984)

### Wax Flower

_[Lauren Gabrielle Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/lauren-gabrielle-photography-cleveland-oh-968285)_

As the name suggests, a wax flower is a waxy wedding flower. The flower is petite, pink and durable. Because of its durability, it's incredibly versatile in wedding flower arrangements.

### Yarrow

_[Samantha James Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/samantha-james-photography-grand-rapids-mi-528414)_

Yarrow almost looks like the yellow cousin of Queen Anne's lace. It is a sturdy flower with a flat bloom structure.

### Zinnia

_[Shanell Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/shanell-photography-st-clair-mi-629139)_

If you like marigolds and camellias, then you'll surely also like zinnias. Zinnias are a petal-rich flower that comes in a variety of bright hues ranging from pink and red to orange and yellow.

## Popular Wedding Greenery and Foliage

Now that you have a thorough understanding of the best flowers for weddings, let's look at popular wedding greenery. Though, you can also go for a monofloral look. The common varieties below are some of the most popular wedding greenery options used by couples.

### Air Plant

![Wedding reception centerpiece with cactus in terrarium and assortment of air plants](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/46794417-e582-4501-b6d4-d23b5afbe74d~rs_768.h-cr_0.60.750.623)

_[Jenny DeMarco Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/jenny-demarco-photography-austin-tx-380666)_

Air plants paradoxically don't need dirt to thrive in the way that most popular wedding greenery varieties do. This greenery works best in centerpieces as opposed to wedding bouquets.

### Bunny's Tail

![Arrangement of bunny's tail stems used as wedding ceremony aisle decor](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/9cbfa319-afbf-4b24-95b4-e3c377035a0f~rs_768.h-cr_0.145.750.708)

_[Katie Edwards Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/katie-edwards-photography-santa-barbara-ca-976272)_

Bunny's tail is one of the few wedding foliage options that isn't green in color. This grass is identifiable by its fluffy white ends that look like rabbit tails.

### Cactus

_[nbarrett photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/nbarrett-photography-dallas-tx-598654)_

If you're planning a wedding in a hot, arid climate, like the American Southwest, then consider including cactus in your lineup of greenery for your wedding. There are many varieties of cactus to think about—you could even get creative and decorate with prickly pear cactus and also serve prickly pear cactus margaritas as a signature cocktail.

### Dusty Miller

_[Misty Miotto Photography](https://www.mistymiotto.com)_

Dusty miller is a popular greenery for weddings. This popular wedding greenery is also known as silver ragwort and is made of soft leaves with textured edges.

### Eucalyptus

![Engagement ring on eucalyptus branch](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/0ad5704c-4501-4694-a8be-effa97a219da~rs_768.h-cr_0.133.750.696)

_[Callie Hobbs Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/callie-hobbs-photography-denver-co-763698)_

Eucalyptus is the most popular greenery for wedding bouquets. There are many varieties of the popular wedding greenery to consider, such as silver dollar eucalyptus, seeded eucalyptus, willow eucalyptus and true blue eucalyptus. "Its muted blue-green tones and resilient leaves are beautiful, especially in a rustic romantic context," says Hunter.

### Fern

_[All Bliss Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/all-bliss-photography-charlotte-nc-875286)_

Ferns are a great green foliage wedding option for rustic or woodland nuptials. Because of the greenery's large, feather-like leaves, it works well as a filler, especially if you're planning on a greenery-only foliage wedding bouquet.

### Fresh Herbs

![Fresh herbs decor](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/aef2d428-3d10-4828-997d-c3a4e9f6fbe2~rs_768.h-cr_61.0.1033.729)

Fresh herbs are an unexpected addition to your typical slate of wedding foliage ideas. "We really love incorporating fresh herbs into our designs, like mint, oregano, sage and rosemary," says Hunter. "Their generally mild fragrance is pleasant, and they bring texture and a seasonal centering that we really like."

### Hops

![Dried hops used as wedding decor](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/600dcf5f-205a-43a1-b930-561589af6400~rs_768.h-cr_0.219.750.782)

_[Jenn Emerling](https://jennemerlingweddings.com)_

Beer lovers, this one's for you. If you're planning to host your wedding at a brewery, why not consider decorating with dried hops to complement the space?

### Hypericum

![Groom with hypericum berry boutonniere](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/4f886ac7-d740-46a1-84a8-62f4a2dc41dd~rs_768.h-cr_0.219.750.782)

_[Karson Photography](https://karsonphotography.smugmug.com)_

Hypericum berries are a unique way to add texture to a flower arrangement. We often see to-be-weds include these hardy berries in boutonnieres as some winter wedding greenery.

### Ivy

![Ivy covered white wedding cake](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/8ff4d415-22d0-479a-b28f-abcb2e44bef1~rs_768.h-cr_0.45.1094.866)

_[Jen Huang Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/jen-huang-photography-new-york-ny-204000)_

If you're planning an English garden-inspired wedding then ivy may be the perfect wedding greenery option for you. Ask your florist to drape ivy vines around banisters and ceiling beams to make your venue feel like a secret garden.

### Lamb's Ear

![Lamb's Ear boutonniere](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/799be385-d921-4404-a218-566de40d2184~rs_768.h-cr_0.1253.2333.3003)

_[Photography: Terri Baskin Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/terri-baskin-photography-fredericksburg-va-523362),__[Floral Design: BCG Events](https://www.bcgevents.com/)_

Lamb's ear is similar in appearance to dusty miller, but has rounded edges instead of textured ones. As the name suggests, the leaves of this wedding foliage are soft like a lamb.

### Lunaria

![Dried lunaria leaves in floral arrangement](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/03937030-d190-4632-90a6-77bbd31834d8~rs_768.h-cr_0.79.750.642)

_[Jeff Brummett Visuals](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/jeff-brummett-visuals-bedford-tx-822082)_

Lunaria is a unique plant whose dried seed pod branches are commonly included as wedding foliage in arrangements. The round seed pods have a translucent parchment-like appearance when dried that gives an ethereal feel to any arrangement that includes them.

### Magnolia

![Magnolia leaf wreath with monogram sign on vintage getaway car](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/ac2a1cf9-61cb-4294-8893-833ce9cc4298~rs_768.h-cr_0.283.750.846)

_[Mike Cassimatis Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/mnc-photography-st-louis-mo-567165)_

Magnolia leaves are hardy and large—two great qualifications for wedding garlands and installations. Magnolia leaf wreaths and garlands are especially popular with weddings in the South.

### Monstera Leaves

![Monstera leaf bouquet](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/d5ba048f-b5d8-4a4a-9acf-59365687b40d~rs_768.h-cr_0.394.675.900)

_[Photography: Mary Costa Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/mary-costa-photography-los-angeles-ca-391745)_

You're probably familiar with these Swiss cheese-like leaves, even if you didn't know they were known as monstera leaves. Monstera leaves are large tropical leaves that are popular at beach weddings.

### Olive Leaves

![A white wedding cake decorated with olive leaves](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/92bcd09c-b8be-404d-9e32-626657ba5779~rs_768.h-cr_0.124.1094.945)

_[Gideon Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/gideon-photography-st-george-ut-398083)_

Olive leaves are a nice option for romantic vineyard weddings because of their soft, muted green appearance. They act as a greenery filler without being visually overbearing.

### Palm Leaves

![Boutonniere with dried palm leaf](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/b615e562-93fb-4fae-8ae4-888d81e9d8c2~rs_768.h-cr_0.219.750.782)

_[Love and Covenant](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/love-and-covenant-photography-inc-tampa-fl-1045419)_

Dried palm leaves are especially popular with boho weddings these days. Dried greenery is a good option if you want something that will last a long time.

### Pampas Grass

![Pampas grass round ceremony altar arch](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/8c54d5e6-13a8-44c0-97d9-f8b792074ff1~rs_768.h-cr_0.255.750.818)

_[Katka Koncal](https://www.katkakoncal.com)_

Pampas grass had a moment in the spotlight and it's not hard to see why so many couples loved this wedding foliage. The grass adds soft texture to any design and is durable since it is used dried, as opposed to fresh.

### Rosemary

![Rosemary wreath boutonniere](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/c6b4cca9-c8d9-4a9a-9a8a-5479c1cb5210~rs_768.h-cr_61.0.1033.729)

_[Photography: CASSANDRA ZETTA](https://www.instagram.com/cassandrazetta/)_

Most wedding greenery options aren't fragrant, but if you want something to scent your big day then consider rosemary. We see many couples place a sprig of rosemary at guest place settings' the savory smell complements dinner smells while fragrant flowers would compete with entrée scents.

### Ruscus

![Bride holding bouquet with Ruscus and roses](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/36df3fa1-bab9-4502-90dc-bc5f311837e1~rs_768.h-cr_0.262.675.768)

_[Cotton Weddings](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/cotton-weddings-houston-tx-647642)_

Ruscus is similar to smilax and is often used as a greenery filler in arrangements. Ruscus is beloved as wedding greenery because it is simple and reliable.

### Smilax

![Smilax on tent pole of sailcloth tent](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/d8afd5b3-9b75-4bc2-bc66-bba68e966115~rs_768.h-cr_0.108.750.671)

_[Lauern Galloway Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/lauren-galloway-photography-tampa-fl-828704)_

Smilax is one of the most popular wedding greenery varieties you've likely never heard of. When florists need a durable, generic greenery to serve as the base for a large-scale design they often use smilax.

### Succulent

![Groom with wool suit jacket and succulent boutonniere](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/696d71e5-fcf5-438f-96b4-bfdcb5bbfb1d~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1000.750)

_[Pat Robinson Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/pat-robinson-photography-wilmington-de-969302)_

Succulents are a mainstay in DIY and rustic weddings because they're durable and affordable. Even if you don't use succulents in your main arrangements, many couples choose to give succulents to guests as favors.
