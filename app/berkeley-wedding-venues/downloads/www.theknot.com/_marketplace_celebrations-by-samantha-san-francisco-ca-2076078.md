Sammy was a DREAM to work with, I’m so so glad we found her through a friend and I’m SO grateful we booked a coordinator. I was on the fence a little about whether we’d need one si...

nce we planned everything ourselves, but thank god we had Sammy. If you’re thinking about doing the whole day of coordination yourself or putting it on a friend—don’t. Get. a. coordinator. Sammy’s flexible, affordable, expert, and sweet. She made our wedding day so relaxing and fun I could cry when I think about it. She is the easiest person to communicate with, and took care of every single potential loose end for us. She worked directly with our florist, bakery, driver, musicians, photographer, and restaurant (and more I’m probably missing). She made sure everything was worry-free for us so we could have the best day ever. She thought of about a million things I didn’t and made it so easy for us to fork over contact details to her on our big day and was the point person for everything from holding phones to my mom’s non-heel shoes. Our wedding was as smooth as could be and all our vendors loved Sammy too. I have no desire to get married again because we did it right the first time, but I’d recommend Sammy to anyone in a heartbeat. You’ll be so freaking thankful to yourself for booking her—not just because you’ll have a coordinator to help you enjoy the day, but also because you have Sammy specifically.

Working with Samantha was truly a joy! She’s fun, bubbly, and incredibly organized, which made the entire planning process so much more enjoyable. From the beginning, she took the ...

time to really understand our vision and was so patient as we worked through our wants and needs. She went above and beyond to accommodate us every step of the way. On the wedding day, her expertise and calm presence were flawless—she handled everything so seamlessly that we were able to fully relax and enjoy the day. We truly couldn’t have done it without her, and we’re so thankful for all that she did to make our wedding so special.

We LOVED working with Samantha! We hired her for a day-of coordinator, but she exceeded our expectations. We had a vision for our wedding to incorporate vintage celestial elements ...

with Star Wars, and Samantha helped make our vision a reality. She was a gem to find! Samantha held regularly scheduled planning meetings via Zoom leading up to the wedding, and we chatted about milestones and our wedding vision. She attended our venue walkthrough with us as well. On the day of, Samantha effortlessly got decorations in place, people in the right place, and handled every single vendor arrival and departure including the dj, food, table and chair rentals, photographers, quartet and officiant. Throughout the evening, Samantha was tactful, kind, professional, and a joy to work with. Absolutely recommend if you're planning a drama free, joy-filled event.
