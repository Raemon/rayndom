g along to every word to their incredible set list. It was really like a rock and roll wedding party! My friend told us they even learned the songs for their special requests!! They nailed it and really set the mood for the rest of the evening. At the after party everyone was still talking about how amazing Pop Rocks was and we all joked about how they will be playing our wedding someday. Well, we are now engaged and will definitely be hiring Pop Rocks for our wedding next summer!! They really blew us away and we are excited to have them play at our wedding!!! Highly recommend.

Hiring Poprocks was one of the first decisions that we made for our wedding, and they exceeded even our high expectations. We had seen them at another friend’s wedding and we were ...

just blow away by the energy and interaction with the crowd and we knew we had to have them. A great mixture of songs to choose from and we couldn’t be happier with our decision. We also enjoy going to see them whenever they play out. An amazing band and the horns are killer!

ing about Pop Rocks weeks after our wedding -- saying that they are the best wedding band they have ever seen! Their main singers are INCREDIBLE and can hit any note. The brass team was insane and their solos were electric!! Pop Rocks was such a joy to work with. Jay and Courtney - were the main POCs we spoke with prior to our wedding day. Their communication and planning was top notch. They guided us through all that had to be done before the wedding day. Pop Rocks is so professional and really catered the music to the vibe and energy of our guests and the night. THEY TOTALLY ROCKED!! I would recommend Pop Rocks to any wedding or event. It truly brought our wedding to the next level. THANK YOU POP ROCKS!!!

Pop Rocks were basically the ultimate. In every way, from booking to ceremony to cocktail hour to dance party. This was a big move for us to hire someone for so many parts of our w...

edding, and they addressed everything with such care and love and expertise. We opted to hire the band as a 9 piece with the horn section which was a great choice. There was a ton of dancing, choreography, CROWD INTERACTION, fun and singinging along. We did not want to end up with a typical cheesy wedding band, so after seeing them live we got the impression we were heading in the exact right direction. Pop Rocks just nailed this all the way!

rancisco and they absolutely stole our hearts. This was SUCH A PERFECT CHOICE in every way. Brad, the band leader, payed attention to every single little detail. He poured his heart out into the performance, and it was EXTRAORDINARY. This band really went over the top, and Ive been to so many weddings. Im 1000% certain we had the best band would could dream of. This band is so much fun every way. I cannot rave enough. please contact me if you need a reference or additional insight. POP ROCKS! We love you! J & G 2022!

Experienced Pop Rocks at my friend's Sept '19 wedding. Had planned early escape with my partner after dinner - we're older and out of the "wedding scene". Got engrossed in conv...

ersation with our table so lost track of time for the planned exit and then the band started. Next thing I knew I was on the dance floor dancing like it was 1980-something! They were incredible, and so was I, moving like nobody's business. They covered the hits and more from the 80s, 90s and today and they were the best cover band that I've ever seen. They even played Boz Scaggs, a personal fave of mine! So glad we stayed on at the reception - when the band was done for the night, we begged them to come back on for an encore - seriously - when does that happen? They granted us that favor and we got down for another 30 minutes - sheer heaven! I've become a huge fan and even brought my "bad moms" squad out to see them live - they were as good at the bar scene (their female lead is amazing and covered Lizzo perfectly). Musically, stage craft, interaction with the audience- all top marks. At both the live show and the wedding, every person was out there shaking their groove thing. I'd even get married again just to have them play at my wedding. My friends keep asking when we're going to see them again. Book this band if you can - they are the best out there.

They played a great cross section of upbeat hits from every decade and then ended their show with "Bohemian Rhapsody", and the singer came into the audience and had everyone singing along and jumping around.It was EPIC! I've never seen that at a wedding! So much fun (insert rock fingers emoji!)

hen they played their first dance songs it was so, so good! So we stuck around and it steadily turned into a full on event! Pop Rocks was amazing. They played every song to perfection. You can tell they've been playing for a long time together and that they are an actual BAND! They were magnificent and forever changed what a band at a wedding should and could be. You can tell they love what they do, have a really fun time doing it and they played their a**es off! There was no "phoning it in" with them. Everyone was on that floor the entire time. They even had our friends, the bride and groom, on stage singing with them. A real rock star moment for them and they really did deliver a great time to a very special wedding for some very special people. In fact, my husband and I are making our friends come with us to see them at one of their public shows next month and we can't wait!

uite a few groups around the Bay Area, and Pop Rocks is hands down the best. It's the perfect mix of current radio hits mixed with rock classics for me and my crew, and I knew they were going to be the right choice for my shindig.

t to over 10 shows from various groups. When we finally saw Pop Rocks, we connected with them as a group of musicians who really put care and heart into their show. And it showed in every step of the process. Their management team was great, their sound engineer was fabulous and Brad and the band could not have been wonderful to work with. They absolutely crushed it the entire time with an intuitive set of songs that packed the dance floor literally the entire three hours they performed. We had grandparents and kids on the dance floor at the same time, and they won over ever single person at the wedding. A huge shout out to everyone on team Pop Rocks for making this such a dream. 5 million stars! I cannot wait to see the photos and video from the big day. Coming soon!

nt vendors we dealt with on our wedding, they were by far the easiest and most fun to go over details with. Pop Rocks had EVERYTHING! Energy, audience participation, the perfect song selection and were so engaging. It was a perfect mix between romantic and nostalgic dances and music to a full on rock concert! We've heard form guests since and all of them raved about the band. A bunch of them have even gone to see Pop Rocks at public performances since then and have become fans! They really are THAT Good!!

on the dance floor! Many people have since told us that Pop Rocks was the best wedding band they have ever seen – and are still demanding an encore! The entire band and crew were so great to work with – they were flexible with our timeline at the venue and maximized their sets to keep great music going all night. Their ability to read the crowd and keep the energy up was unbelievable. The band also worked with us to learn a song for our first dance that wasn’t on their original set list, which meant so much to us. I could not recommend Pop Rocks more as the best wedding band (including the incredible horn section!). Pop Rocks made our wedding unforgettable, and we will cherish our memories singing and dancing with them forever. We are already planning to attend one of their concerts in the Bay Area to keep the party going :) Thank you Pop Rocks!!!!!

Guests partied so hard there were injuries. One of our guests danced so much she was in a leg boot the next day. She had zero regrets; said she had the time of her life. Pop Rocks...

made our wedding perfect! We had an un-responsive caterer, crappy weather, and a food truck that never showed, but we forgot all about it when Pop Rocks took the stage. All we wanted to do was dance with each other, and they delivered like the rock stars that they are. Even my shy mother danced. It's amazing how much energy that have, to get people on the dance floor.

ily. These guys really have the energy and also were super easy to work with, and the JSP team along with Sarah took great care of us and we had some tricky parts to navigate. We were picky in our choice of band and we'd heard so much about these guys in the Bay Area that we had to have them. There's a lot of chain bands out there that aren't even really bands, and we wanted to make sure that we didn't hire one of those because you just don't know what your gonna get. They played some particular songs that meant something to us that we're not on their song list and we appreciated that. Can't say enough good things about these guys and I'd hire them again in a second.

We've been to several weddings and the music can make or break the entire reception. These guys put on such a fantastic show you can't help but dance and have such a blast. My buddies, who don't dance, were out there dancing like Lionel Richie...ALL NIGHT LONG!!! Which they played! We knew as soon as we saw them at a local club that they were the perfect band for our wedding. From MC'ing our entrance and wedding party, to playing our first dances perfectly to making us dance and have such a fun end to our night. Their list of songs is superb and have a little of everything. And they were really funny and engaging with everyone from our nieces and nephews to our grand parents! They all loved these guys. Also, special shout out to Jay and Sarah who are nothing short of amazing to work with from the very beginning. Was effortless and painless, even when we hit a tiny snafu. They knew what to do and made it all happen. Thank you all so much!!! We highly recommend POP ROCKS!!!!

ig day and our friends and family kept talking about how amazing the band was at the reception and that they'd never seen a band take over a wedding reception like Pop Rocks did. "Turned into more of a rock concert" my father kept remarking. The band members were personable, attentive to our music requests and the whole process from initially hiring them to working out all the details beforehand couldn't have been an easier, less stressful process. 5 stars for Pop Rocks!

This review is overdue, but I needed about 2 months to come down from the high of our wedding in early February and be able to articulate my thoughts. When my husband and I were ...

thinking about music options for our wedding, we already knew what we wanted for our first dance, and a couple of other important moments. I had about a 45-minute conversation with Jay Siegan, wherein he asked what we were looking for, and a little about us. In summary, our first dance song was going to be Radiohead's Creep, and I wanted to walk down the aisle to Johnny Cash's Walk the Line. The reason we had selected Pop Rocks as a potential band was that their song list included Everlong, so we figured Creep might also be in their wheelhouse. Boy, was it. I'm not 100% sure if they knew it beforehand, but they're willing to learn a song or two for you, and they killed it. Working with everyone, from Jay (who handles the initial booking), to Sarah (who is the details lady), was a dream. They were super responsive, and Jay also made sure to put us on the list when the band was playing nearby, so we could see them in action and wouldn't just have some randos playing our wedding. Brad and the gang rock. They are so nice, and FUN. They obviously love what they do, and it comes through in a major way. For the ceremony, we hired Clay to do background music as people arrived, and also do the music for the ceremony. I can't speak highly enough of his performance. Again, we had some interesting requests (recessional: Kenny Loggins' Danger Zone), and he either learned it or just pulled it out of his repertoire and slayed it in front of 150 people. We have gotten more compliments about the ceremony music, and I agree with all of them! On to the reception. Usually at weddings, there is a song or two that I use as 'bathroom songs,' where it's not really my cup of tea, so I use that time to leave the dance floor and take care of other business. This song list made those times like Sophie's Choice. You are able to request some songs, and also request some NOT to be played, and I had given them a few requests/nonrequests (I don't love Madonna, Chris likes Billy Idol, etc.). Additionally, I remembered a couple of especially awesome moments from their concert we went to (Prince medley is unbelievable). They took my requests, and filled in the blanks expertly. They played Paul Simon. They played Billy Idol. They played the Foo Fighters. Andy Grammer. Toto. The last song(s) of the evening was Blur's Song 2 into Smells Like Teen Spirit. Side note: My husband was really bummed before the wedding that he couldn't find his Slayer socks (yes), and mentioned it to the band later on when he was chatting with them. The drummer pulled up his pants leg, and was wearing the. exact. same. pair. I'm not saying it's kismet, but it felt like they were supposed to be at our wedding. Chris hates dancing (I had to negotiate to have a first dance at all), and he was on the floor the whole time. TL;DR- Book them. They're a dream.

Pop Rocks is hands down the best wedding band in the universe. They played at my best friends wedding back in June. From the moment they started playing people were out of their se...

ats and on their feet; and it didn't stop. Everyone danced all night long. We recently got together with a group of friends who all attended the wedding, and everyone was still talking about Pop Rocks. They played everything and anything people wanted to hear. I could sing along to every song.

My husband, Adam, and I were lucky enough to have Pop Rocks perform at our wedding at the San Francisco Design Center on 6/24/17. We knew we wanted to have a band instead of a DJ...

for the reception music, and the process of selecting a band who we KNEW would be amazing was not easy! Taking into account budget, style, talent, vibe.... there was a lot to consider when we went and saw a lot of different potential bands perform live while we were trying to make a decision. When we saw Pop Rocks perform live in the summer of 2016, Adam and I looked at each other and just knew. They were IT! I was so excited to see them perform at our wedding, and they DID NOT DISAPPOINT :) We had very high expectations, and not only were we more than pleased, our guests were sooooo impressed. We are still receiving compliments from wedding guests months later about how fun and talented Pop Rocks was. Many guests told us that having Pop Rocks perform set our wedding apart from so many other weddings they've been to. One guest told us it felt like they were at a concert, not a wedding reception. Pop Rocks is just that good! They listened to our requests, and learned and performed several songs that we requested that were not already on their very extensive song list. They interacted with the crowd, played a variety of fun, up-tempo, music... everything from classic 80s pop and rock songs to current hits, and everything in between. Pop Rocks is the best, and I would HIGHLY recommend them for your wedding if you're looking for top-notch entertainment!

From start to finish, our experience with Pop Rocks and Jay Siegan Presents was top notch. The way they make sure you get everything you want, but also take the lead, is fantastic....

We wanted our wedding to be memorable, and they certainly helped us achieve that. Their energy was contagious and everyone had such a fun time. I highly recommend them for your wedding band - they're so much more than that!

Pop Rocks is THE band to book for your wedding. While my husband and I were looking for a band every vendor we talked with recommended Pop Rocks and we booked them before we had ev...

en heard them perform. For our wedding I wanted to make sure it was a massive dance party and Pop Rocks made that happen. They were super easy to work with, fun, energetic, and even a week later people from our wedding are still talking about them. New Orleans is a very special place for my husband and I so when we booked Pop Rocks we requested the horns section and used them as a "big band" during the cocktail hour. Highly highly highly recommend!!!

I can not express to everyone how incredible Jay Siegan Presents and POP ROCKS is! We booked through Jay Siegan the band Pop Rocks for our wedding, because live music is the ONLY ...

way to go! What an incredible experience we had for our special day! Great communication and details from Jay and Sarah. They gave us options on best fits in our price range and where to see them live. POP ROCKS was it for us. After one song we knew we would book them. JSP attention to detail and addressing my endless questions promptly and directly put me at ease. We received endless compliments on POP ROCKS our entire guest list ranging from 20's to late 60s LOVED them and everyone danced the night away. POP ROCKS are incredible! Great energy, amazing musicans, nice people and costume changes. We are so very happy and our memories will be treasured. Having a live band and POP ROCKS was INCREDIBLE! We cant wait to throw another party and have them there - all in good time! If you didn't get it they are INCREDIBLE - I cant say it enough!

Wow. Where to begin. I was well acquainted with the talented and energetic guys and gals from Pop Rocks before our wedding. My wife and I had attended multiple Pop Rocks shows a...

t a variety of venues over the years, and always had a blast. This is an important point as I knew ahead of our wedding that they are flexible and can make a variety of set ups work. I had also worked with Pop Rocks for other events, and have had fantastic experiences across the board. They've always been professional, deliver consistently energetic performances and perhaps most importantly - and this is what sets them apart - is the interactive nature of their performances. This is why I've worked with them so many times. So it's safe to say that my wife and I were fans. Our wedding was in in Lake Tahoe and the evening went off without a hitch. I knew they would kill it, but they blew away our friends and family who had not seen them before. What an awesome night. Don't bother looking for another band. Pop Rocks is the truth.

Pop Rocks were one of the first, best, and easiest decisions made while planning our wedding. We can't possibly heap enough praise on the band, or the coordination through Jay Sie...

gan Presents. Jay, his team, and this band helped make our wedding endlessly fun, memorable, unique, and very very special. Months later, we're still getting compliments on the music. Pop Rocks & JSP were fantastic to work with from first contact through the event itself. They worked well with both us and our wedding planner, accommodated any requests we had, and consistently offered to go above and beyond any crazy suggestion we threw their way. These folks really care about making every event special, obviously have a deep love for music, and go well beyond any reasonable expectation to make it great. Pop Rocks are hands-down the best party band in the Bay Area (and beyond). Having seen them perform at several venues for different crowds, we can tell you that they are experts at reading the room and delivering the right show to get your guests happy and dancing. They're experienced, professional, sound great, and the fun they have playing together is infectious. Great dressers as well. This band works hard for the crowd. I don't think I have ever seen my parents dance before, EVER, and Pop Rocks made it happen. It's one of the things I'll always remember about our wedding celebration. In addition to the live entertainment, they provided stellar MC services and a fantastic playlist for the time they were off-stage. Their repertoire is large and versatile, and again they embraced every special request we threw their way (my wife and I both snuck in a few musical surprises for one another, and the band turned these into amazing moments for both of us--and kept our secrets well). If you're hosting an event and want great live music and an easy experience, do not hesitate to contact Pop Rocks and Jay Siegan Presents - they will not let you down.
