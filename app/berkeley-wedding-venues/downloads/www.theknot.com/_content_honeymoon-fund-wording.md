Updated Mar 27, 2025

If you and your partner value experiences over things, a traditional wedding registry might not be for you. Instead, consider a honeymoon fund—a unique way for guests to contribute to your first big trip together as newlyweds. But like any [wedding registry wording](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-registry-wording), you'll need the right honeymoon fund wording to inform your guests of your wishes. 

[READ MORE Ready for a Vaca? Add a Honeymoon Fund to Your Registry ](https://www.theknot.com/registry)

Here, we've included lots of sample wording for a honeymoon fund—because we totally get that [asking for money for a wedding gift ](https://www.theknot.com/content/asking-for-money-wedding-gifts)can feel a little unnatural. Whether you'll be including a short mention on your wedding invitation or adding a blurb to your wedding website, we'll show you how to word a honeymoon fund. 

And remember—a honeymoon fund can be used alongside a traditional registry ([The Knot Registry Store](https://www.theknot.com/registry) is the place to get that done) or on its own—it's your choice! We recommend registering for your honeymoon at [Traveler's Joy](https://www.theknot.com/registry/travelers-joy-registry), one of the [best honeymoon registries](https://www.theknot.com/content/best-honeymoon-registries). Link it to The Knot Registry to make it easier for guests to find.

## Honeymoon Fund Wording for Invitations 

Your invitation (wedding or shower!) is a great place to include information about your honeymoon fund. While some couples choose to include a sentence about it at the bottom of their main invitation, another option is to include a separate card that gives your guests all the details. You can find [invitation suites on The Knot](https://www.theknot.com/paper/invitations/wedding) in an array of colors, themes and formats.
