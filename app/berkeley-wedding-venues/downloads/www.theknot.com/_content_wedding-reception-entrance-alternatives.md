If you and your partner bonded over tee times or weekend golf trips, honor that shared passion with a tunnel of raised golf clubs for your reception entrance. Ask friends or wedding party members to line up on either side of the walkway and hold the clubs overhead to create a celebratory arch.

### Ring a Church Bell

After you say "I do," literally ring in your new marriage by ringing a church bell. If your ceremony or reception isn't near a church, use small handheld bells to announce your marriage. 

### Military Saber Wedding Entrance

_[Photo: Spark & Tumble](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/spark-and-tumble-oakland-ca-766053)_

If you or your partner is in the military, honor that service with a traditional saber arch as you enter your wedding reception. Members of the honor guard hold their sabers overhead to form a ceremonial tunnel for you to walk beneath, which is a really nice gesture that symbolizes respect, unity and support for your marriage.

### Enter Wearing Jerseys From Your Favorite Sport

Show love for your favorite sports team by entering the reception wearing jerseys over your wedding attire. This couple showed love for the Cleveland Cavaliers at their nuptial celebration. 

## Easy Wedding Entrance Ideas

Prefer keeping your wedding entrance simple? Then we have options for that too. And don't worry. Your entrance can still be grand with these easy ideas. 

### Head Straight to the Dance Floor

![Bride and groom dancing in front of guests. ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/70fba0ab-0b3b-4038-9199-16cee3826861~rs_768.h-cr_150.0.2550.1800)

Once wedding guests have gathered in the reception space, use your special entrance to make a beeline for the dance floor to take your inaugural spin as newlyweds. You can have your wedding party members join you after [your first dance](https://www.theknot.com/content/classic-first-dance-songs) or peel off to do your parent-child dances.

### Enter With Your Wedding Party

![Bride and groom dancing with wedding party at the reception.](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/f5f88a2f-96ab-4b36-8512-fd6466c8d685~rs_768.h-cr_300.0.5100.3600)

_[Photo: Jen Lynne Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/jen-lynne-photography-new-york-ny-543750)_

Share the spotlight with your bridesmaids and groomsmen before your grand entrance. A choreographed wedding dance will definitely pump up the crowd. Guests will be seriously impressed by everyone's performance skills.

### Roll Out the Red Carpet

![Bride and groom walking down a red carpet.](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/5d7a6282-4ffa-438f-a31b-f8a9eb363650~rs_768.h-cr_113.0.1888.1331)

_[Photo: Jen Lynne Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/jen-lynne-photography-new-york-ny-543750)_

For this glamorous Hollywood-themed, a red carpet was a must. Pretend you're a celebrity and strut your stuff on a red runner. You can even hand out disposable cameras to your guests to act as paparazzi. 

### Give a Welcome Toast

![Bride and groom making a wedding welcome speech.](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/be9f1667-10a0-4196-b2b8-1fa100c74f99~rs_768.h-cr_15.0.1455.1080)

_[Photo: Gage Blake Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/gage-blake-photography-toeldo-oh-427550)_

If you'd rather break the ice and announce yourselves with a few words, take the mic, a glass of bubbly and give a brief [welcome toast](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-welcome-speech). Thank everyone for coming, shout out your parents and raise a glass to love.

### Start Off With Karaoke

![Bride and groom singing karaoke with their guests.](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/6e6a39bb-2e88-47ac-b297-32bd0f5099c1~rs_768.h-cr_320.0.5440.3840)

_[Photo: Emily Jean Images](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/emily-jean-images-san-francisco-ca-970215)_

An easy way to get your guests excited and happy for the reception is by bringing out a karaoke machine. Start singing your favorite [karaoke song](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-karaoke-songs) with your partner, then invite your guests to take the mic. 

### Elegant Staircase Entrance

![a couple entering their wedding via staircase](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/12b62c95-5e2f-4593-800d-a55d07e5da2b~rs_768.h-cr_54.0.1351.973)

_Photo: Imagen Photos_

If your venue features a dramatic staircase, turn it into the ultimate statement moment by making your grand entrance from above. Glide down the steps hand-in-hand (or pause for a twirl halfway down) while your guests look up in admiration.

### Cut Your Wedding Cake First

![Grooms cutting wedding cake together. ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/c7ae7de6-709d-4ac9-83b6-9a5605a42629~rs_768.h-cr_0.183.1080.1623)

_[Photo: inly co](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/inly-co-detroit-mi-2012033)_

Feeling rebellious? No rule says you can't have cake before dinner. If you're not into a grand spectacle, start your reception by [cutting your wedding cake](https://www.theknot.com/content/cutting-the-cake). It's a sweet way to kick off your celebration and get everyone in the party mood (and it doesn't require choreography).

### Subtly Sneak In

![Bride and groom slow dancing on the dance floor. ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/35b7dad0-a88d-43fa-beea-daeb007247fd~rs_768.h-cr_0.418.2507.3761)

Low-key couples will love this understated wedding entrance strategy. Everyone's heard of an Irish exit (when you slip out of a party without saying goodbye), so consider this the Irish wedding reception entrance. After [taking wedding portraits](https://www.theknot.com/content/must-have-wedding-photos), quietly join cocktail hour for some face time with your nearest and dearest. (No emcee announcement, spotlights or cheering necessary.) The reception is busy, making it hard to talk to everyone. Take advantage of whatever cocktail time you can to make the rounds and enjoy the party you spent so much time planning.

## Wedding Entrance Ideas FAQs

Have some questions? Here's some helpful information you might want to consider when it comes to wedding entrance ideas.

### What is a grand entrance for a wedding reception?

A wedding grand entrance typically happens at the start of the reception. This is when you and your partner are announced and introduced to your guests as an "officially" married couple. It's common for couples to allow their [wedding party](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-party-entrance-songs) members to make their entrances first, so they act as the grand finale. Also, speaking with your DJ or emcee about your name pronunciation and how you'd like to be introduced for your entrance is important so everyone is on the same page.

### What are some fun wedding entrance dances?

Your wedding entrance dance can be as silly and spontaneous, or thought out and [choreographed](https://www.theknot.com/content/reasons-to-take-dance-lessons) as you'd like. Some fun and easy wedding entrance dance ideas are the Two-Step, the Dougie or body roll. And if dancing isn't one of your strengths, look at [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4wLQT4EJgeckZexDlHINag) or [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@theknot?lang=en) for helpful beginner-friendly wedding entrance dance ideas.

### What is the best music for your wedding entrance?

Base the music you play during your wedding reception entrance on the vibe of your wedding reception playlist or the tone you want to set when your guests initially see you as a newlywed. Still don't know where to start? Then look at this [wedding entrance song](about:blank) list that works for any wedding.
