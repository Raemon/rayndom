If you know you're getting engaged soon, it's likely that you and your partner have discussed whether to buy an engagement ring with a lab-grown diamond or a natural diamond. To make an informed decision, you're probably wondering what is a lab-grown diamond, how is it different from a natural diamond and why are they so popular? For the first time, more than half of couples (52%) have an engagement ring with a lab-grown stone, according to The Knot 2025 Real Weddings Study* survey of nearly 17,000 US-based couples who got married in 2024. This was a 6% jump from the previous year and a 40% surge from 2019. We called the experts to find out everything you need to know about lab-grown diamonds to decide what is the best fit for your love story.

## What is a Lab-Grown Diamond?

Let's start with the basics: a lab-grown diamond is a diamond that was grown in a lab instead of mined from the Earth. "Natural diamonds are formed deep within the earth over billions of years. Lab diamonds, on the other hand, are grown in a matter of weeks using advanced technology that replicates that natural process—but they're still real diamonds through and through," says Jillian Sassone, the founder and creative director of the jewelry company [Marrow Fine](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=59345&awinaffid=565019&campaign=&clickref=Theknot.com-lab-grown-diamonds&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.marrowfine.com%2F%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOooHKXGw60P4LF2o6QNrGDPrJavede5qewND2_VUtCSb7XEuxm8r&platform=pl), which sells both natural and [lab diamond engagement rings](https://google.com/url?q=https://www.theknot.com/content/lab-grown-diamond-rings&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1761151929554575&usg=AOvVaw0d2-2b3x1z5AipVLjC9mRp). 

## When Did Lab-Grown Diamonds Start?

While lab-grown diamonds have surged in popularity relatively recently, the [history of man-made diamonds](https://www.gemsociety.org/article/brief-history-of-lab-grown-diamonds/) dates back farther than you might expect. In 1954, General Electric (GE) manufactured the first lab-grown diamonds using High-Pressure High-Temperature (HPHT) technology. However, the stones were only used for industrial purposes because they were too small to be used for jewelry. In 1971, GE was able to create a gem-quality diamond. Still, throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the diamonds GE and other manufacturers made were mostly small and yellow. A new technique called Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) hit the market in the 2000s, making it possible to create larger, higher quality lab-grown diamonds. Lab-grown diamonds became [mainstream in the mid-2010s](https://www.jewelersmutual.com/resources/individuals/diamonds/history-of-lab-grown-diamonds), and there have been continued quality and energy-efficiency improvements.

## Are Lab-Grown Diamonds Real Diamonds?

Yes, a lab-grown diamond is a real diamond. "At the core, a diamond is a diamond—whether it's formed in the Earth or grown in a lab. Chemically and visually, they're identical. Both are made of carbon, both are incredibly durable, and both deliver the same sparkle. The real difference is just the origin," says Sassone.

Lab-created diamonds shouldn't be confused with moissanite, white sapphire or white zircon, which look similar to diamonds but are chemically different from both lab-grown and [natural diamonds](https://www.theknot.com/content/natural-diamonds).

## How are Lab-Grown Diamonds Made?

There are two methods for creating a lab-diamond: HPHT and CVD. "The HPHT method approximates the conditions found deep within the Earth. Carbon is subjected to extremely high pressure and temperature until it crystallizes into a diamond," explains a GIA spokesperson. "The CVD method involves placing a thin diamond seed into a chamber filled with carbon-containing gas. This gas is then ionized, causing the carbon atoms in the gas to precipitate out and bond layer by layer onto a diamond seed and grow into a diamond," they add. 

## How are Lab-Grown Diamonds Certified and Graded?

Also referred to as diamond grading, diamond certification is a system that evaluates the quality of a diamond based on the GIA's [Four Cs](https://www.theknot.com/content/engagement-ring-diamond-grading)—carat, color, clarity and cut. It's important to buy a certified diamond so you know exactly what you're paying for and can compare the price of your stone with similarly graded diamonds. Gemstone grading organizations evaluate lab-grown and natural diamonds. While some will provide the Four Cs for both, GIA has a different grading system for lab diamonds. "Since laboratory-grown diamonds can be created within a narrow range of color and clarity, it is no longer appropriate to apply the 4Cs terminology, which is more relevant to the broader range of diamonds available in nature," a Gemological Institute of America (GIA) spokesperson told The Knot.

## What are the Benefits of Lab-Grown Diamonds?

If you ask someone why they chose a lab-grown diamond, they're likely to mention the cost, sustainability and ethical sourcing, with cost being a leading factor. "Lab diamonds are usually more budget-friendly, which means you might be able to go bigger or choose a higher quality stone without stretching your budget," says Sassone. 

While producing lab-grown diamonds can be more sustainable than mining, it is important to evaluate the production and mining practices. "Not all lab diamonds are created the same—some are made using fossil fuels, which can leave a bigger carbon footprint. Others are produced with renewable energy, which makes a big difference. If sustainability is important to you, it's worth asking how the diamond was made," says Sassone. She also says a more sustainable option is to buy an [antique diamond](https://www.theknot.com/content/antique-engagement-rings). "Since they're already in circulation, they don't require new resources, making them one of the most sustainable choices. And, they come with a sense of history and character you won't find in a newly cut stone."

One of the key reasons people buy lab-grown diamonds is that they think it eliminates any uncertainty about supporting unethical mining practices or, although it is extremely rare, buying a conflict diamond. However, there are also safeguards in place to ensure that natural diamonds are ethically sourced. Many leading jewelry companies are part of the [Kimberley Process](https://www.kimberleyprocess.com/) which means they can guarantee that a diamond is not a conflict diamond. Many jewelers also buy directly from mines to make sure they only support mines with ethical and more sustainable practices. "Lab diamonds are often considered the more ethical choice since they don't require new mining. But if you're leaning toward a natural diamond, you can still make a thoughtful decision—just look for brands that are transparent about their sourcing practices," says Sassone.

## Are Lab-Grown Diamonds Cheaper Than Mined Diamonds?

Yes. Lab-grown diamonds typically [cost](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-much-to-spend-on-engagement-ring) 30 to 40% less per carat than natural diamonds, according to The Diamond Registry. 

## Do Lab-Grown Diamonds Pass a Diamond Tester?

A lab-grown diamond is a diamond so it will pass a diamond tester, however there is technology that can differentiate a lab-grown diamond from a mined diamond. "To the naked eye, laboratory-grown and natural diamonds appear identical. The differences between them are detectable with the use of specialized equipment. All laboratory-grown diamonds can be accurately identified by qualified gemological laboratories, and some can also be detected using screening devices available within the trade," says the GIA spokesperson. 

## Do Lab-Grown Diamonds Hold Their Value?

For both lab-grown and mined diamonds, there is a difference between the purchase price, appraisal price and resale value. The purchase price is typically much higher than the appraised value because of markups. The appraised value is based on the 4Cs, setting and commodity market. The resale value for natural diamonds is typically 25% to 50% of the purchase price, according to [The Diamond Registry](https://www.diamondregistry.com/resale-value-of-diamonds/). There is not a lot of data on the resale value for lab-grown diamonds, but they are likely to have a lower value. However, if you plan on wearing the engagement ring for the rest of your life and possibly passing it down to the next generation, the resale value doesn't need to be a leading factor in your purchasing decision.
