Having your photo taken straight out of bed might sound like your own personal nightmare—unless of course, it's the morning of your wedding. There are certainly no rules about what to wear before you say your I dos, but it's common for brides and their wedding party to don coordinating loungewear.

Not only will a matching set of bridesmaid PJs ensure your squad looks cohesive as your photographer captures those coveted glam shots, they're practical too. While some wedding merch can be tricky to reuse, a pair of pajamas is something that'll easily be worn again.

## Where to Buy Bridesmaid Pajama Sets

The good news is that there are so many places to find bridesmaid pajama sets online. The bad news is that having a plethora of options can make your decision even harder. That's why I've curated my favorite stores to buy bridal party PJs. These brands offer the best quality, the best prices and the cutest prints, which is exactly what you need when searching for a great gift for your VIPs. 

[**Birdy Grey:**](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=9ibcrDa*U1o&mid=44848&u1=TK-bridesmaid-pajamas&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.birdygrey.com%2Fcollections%2Fbridesmaid-getting-ready-outfits) If you're a bride on a budget, bridal party PJs might not be the area you want to splurge on. Luckily, Birdy Grey offers plenty of options, many of which are under $50. Plus, you'll save as you shop: For orders of four or more styles, you'll save 10% off. As an added bonus, they're available in the brand's signature shades, so you can match them to your bridesmaids' dresses.

[**Azazie**](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=88935&awinaffid=565019&campaign=&clickref=TK-bridesmaid-pajamas&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.azazie.com%2Fall%2Frobes%3Fsort_by%3Dpopularity&platform=pl): Azazie offers bridesmaid dresses in hundreds of colors and silhouettes, and their selection of bridesmaid PJs boasts the exact same variety. Not only is their sleepwear elegant and affordable, some offer customization options to make your girls feel even more special. And thanks to surprise sales throughout the year, you might be able to score a deal, like 10% off orders of three or more PJ sets. 

**[Etsy](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6220&awinaffid=565019&campaign=&clickref=TK-bridesmaid-pajamas&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2F&platform=pl)****:** Looking for custom bride and bridesmaid pajama sets for you and your crew? Don't sleep on Etsy (pun intended). If you've got a vision in mind for your prewedding looks, there are plenty of talented designers and artisans on the platform that can help bring it to life, like [Le Rose Gifts](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6220&awinaffid=565019&campaign=&clickref=TK-bridesmaid-pajamas&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fshop%2FLeRoseGifts&platform=pl), [Taniri Designs](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6220&awinaffid=565019&campaign=&clickref=TK-bridesmaid-pajamas&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fshop%2FTaniriDesigns%3F&platform=pl) and [SS Weddings](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6220&awinaffid=565019&campaign=&clickref=TK-bridesmaid-pajamas&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fshop%2FSSweddings&platform=pl).

[**Lulus**](https://lulusfashionloungellc.sjv.io/c/64733/1810759/21545?subId1=TK-bridesmaid-pajamas&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lulus.com%2Fcategories%2F1866%2Fintimates-and-sleepwear.html)**:** Lulus is another one of my go-tos for bridal party attire, including bridesmaid pajama sets. I'm a big fan of their satin designs, and I think you will be too. Not to mention, they have plenty of matching options for the bride, all at reasonable prices. 

[**Anthropologie**](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=9ibcrDa*U1o&mid=39789&u1=TK-bridesmaid-pajamas&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anthropologie.com%2Fbhldn-bridal-lingerie)**:** Although the loungewear at Anthropologie is a bit pricier than some other bridesmaid PJ shops, it's attire your girls will definitely wear again. Browse an array of pajama sets and nightgowns with elegant lace trim, whimsical floral prints and sweet details like tiny bows and satin sashes. 

[**Show Me Your Mumu:**](https://www.pntra.com/t/8-10469-88550-130194?sid=TK-bridesmaid-pajamas&website=177979&url=https%3A%2F%2Fshowmeyourmumu.com%2Fcollections%2Fmumu-weddings-getting-ready%3Fshop_type%3Dbridal) Take a look at the bridesmaid jammies from Show Me Your Mumu and try to tell me they aren't some of the cutest designs you've ever seen. Available in long pants, short sets and nightgowns, the elevated loungewear at this retailer will make your wedding morning feel oh-so luxurious. Plus, you can shop [bridesmaid dresses](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridesmaid-dresses-online) on the same site. Talk about convenience.

[**Petite Plume**](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=96951&awinaffid=565019&campaign=&clickref=TK-bridesmaid-pajamas&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.petite-plume.com%2F&platform=pl): As the proud owner of a Petite Plume pajama set, I can attest that the hype is real. These ultra-soft PJs are the comfiest in my rotation, and the pink floral print sparks the utmost joy. Given their higher cost, consider investing in these bridesmaid PJs if you have a smaller bridal party, or if you're looking for one knockout gift to treat your crew to something high-end.
