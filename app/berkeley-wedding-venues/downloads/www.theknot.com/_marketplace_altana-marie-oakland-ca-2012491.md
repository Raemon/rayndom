ing and Altana was our first consultation - needless to say we didn’t need to chat to any more jewelers. Everyone was so warm and welcoming, and from start to finish, really saw what we were trying to do with our rings. They answered our every question - there were tons - and were always responsive and prompt with us, even during busier seasons. We worked on our rings with this team for a little under a year and could not be more pleased with how they turned out. I have recommended Altana and team to many other friends who are beginning to look around, and will continue to for years to come!

We are so glad we decided to go with a small business jeweler instead of a big box store! We decided early on we wanted to design our own wedding rings and they came out perfectly!...

The staff is so delightful to work with and they are really meticulous with the details. We worked together for months designing our rings and are elated with how they turned out as well as the story they tell! We used some heirloom diamonds from my grandmother's ring in mine and have some leftover- so I will absolutely work with them again!

Altana helps you navigate through all of the above and helps you find the ring that actually speaks to you and your partner. If you are local to the bay, or near the bay, or just want to work with someone with artistic prowess to help make your rings and engagement/wedding experience unique to you, definitely check out Altana!

red her heart into hearing our love story and translating it into wearable art. She came to every meeting with ideas and a warmth that made the whole process so seamless from start to finish. The women she has working with her match her spirit and were so supportive and communicative as well. She and her team are so busy all of the time with many different custom and on custom projects, but we never felt like she did not have time for us, or that her attention was somewhere else. She gave her full self to each meeting and the end products absolutely reflected that. I can't wait for the many projects we will have with her in the future!

We can't speak highly enough of the Altana team. Altana, Sakura, Ana-Sofia, and everyone else behind the scenes worked meticulously with us to craft our dream custom wedding rings....

We had candid conversations about budget, materials, design iteration, production process, and even insurance procedures. Sakura in particular worked tirelessly to locate the perfect stone and facilitate iteration loops with us, listening carefully to our detailed feedback, and ultimately delivering beyond expectation. Our rings are everything we wanted, and it's all thanks to the team at Altana. If you're looking for a jeweler to make your vision a reality, then stop reading this and get in touch with Altana!

w anything about rings going into this. From educating us about stones and types of metals to taking time to answer our questions about sketches and the CAD model, Altana and her team always took time to make sure we were comfortable with taking the next step forward. We found a ring in our travels that gave us inspiration for the general band style we liked, but the band we found was thicker than I wanted. I also wanted to keep the stone as close to my finger as possible since I'm always on the go and was worried about it snagging on things. It was definitely hard to tell exactly what the ring would look like from the CAD, but Altana 100% captured the delicate design we had hoped for in the end and it was even better than we could have envisioned! We are so grateful!

Altana came through in such an incredible way for me this past year. I cannot even express... My girlfriend and I were at the place in our relationship where I was ready to propose...

to her, and I wanted it to be special. I contacted Altana because I wanted to have a custom ring made for the proposal, but all I had was an idea and a simple drawing on some paper. Altana not only was able to take that simple concept, and help me to bring to reality better than I had imagined, but she did it on the timeframe that I needed it by. She took time to discuss everything with me, drew up multiple prototype options for my choosing, and was able to add some special touches that brought my idea to life better than I had hoped. What's more, the fact that she brought it to fruition in only a handful of weeks blew me away. It was honestly one of the most professional experiences I have had getting anything custom like this accomplished. She was reassuring, capable, and delivered the piece better than I expected and on time... Truly, Altana is a professional who can be trusted to deliver. ~ And in case you are wondering, it was a "Yes, of course!" from my now fiancée! She LOVES the ring, and we are now working with Altana on the wedding rings together... A++, 5 stars, 100% recommend Altana for anything that you need!

Originally, we were thinking of ordering my stack of rings (sapphire emerald-cut solitaire, marquis diamond reset, and gold band), but I contacted Altana and asked if she would also make my partner's ring during the process. We are so thankful for Altana and it's really special how she incorporated our ideas and made a stack of beautiful rings. I would highly recommend her store.

Let me preface this review by saying I had been hunting for the perfect jeweler for about a year before stumbling upon Altana's work. Before Altana, I could not find someone I comp...

letely trusted to create the most important piece of jewelry I would ever own -- my engagement ring. From the consultation to the finished piece, my partner and I felt assured throughout the entire process. Altana ensures that her customers feel empowered in their decisions, regardless of whether they know exactly what they want or have no idea where to start. She can even anticipate questions before they are asked! As a lifelong learner, I truly appreciated Altana teaching me about her industry. I will always remember her taking me outside in the natural sunlight to view some diamonds through a diamond loupe firsthand. Above all, I have the utmost respect for her transparency, both on her website and during our appointments. I believe the relationship built through this journey was equally as crucial as the ring itself. I am ecstatic that my partner and I found a woman-owned jeweler a mere 20-minute walk from our first apartment together. Beyond her expertise and craftsmanship, Altana has an effervescent spirit and a can-do attitude that is so essential. Thank you, Altana and Cassandra, for helping create my perfect engagement ring and for building my confidence!

After an unfortunately horrible experience with my poorly crafted & constantly breaking original engagement ring, I brought the piece to Altana and she rebuilt it and redesigned it...

with me. I was in awe of her ability to take all the things I loved/didn’t love about it, respect the initial design, and put her stamp of quality and artistry on it. I am so in love with the ring I have now and it feels so sturdy and solid. Her artistry ran free when we asked her to build my wedding band to compliment it. My husband and I had very different ideas and in our consultation she laid out different patterns and helped us, through her creative lens, to find something we both love. She made my husbands ring as well! And I got a ring made for my extra daughter with the same stone as my band. I appreciated how she made something so simple, appropriate, in budget and so completely special. She was so genuinely excited to hear the story of how I gave her the ring - it was so kind of her. I’ve recommended a few friends to Altana and she never disappoints. Her work is always well made, stunning, and special. And her customer service is unlike anyone I’ve ever met - so genuinely excited to help be a part of your journey through her art. Couldn’t recommend anyone more!

A friend had recommended working with Altana because of their wonderful experience, and Altana did not disappoint. Altana is an artist first, jeweler second, thus all of her creations are unique, beautifully crafted, and reflect a piece of you and your partner. She treats you like a creative equal partner during the entire process, rather than just another transaction. If you're thinking about buying an engagement ring (or any jewelry really), Altana Fine Jewelry is a must stop! Altana - thanks for helping us create a memorable engagement, a magnificent ring for my grandma, and for the wonderful, safe, and inclusive ambience. (PS shoutout to Salami and Cassandra as well!)

Altana was amazing - - she was very professional from the start, worked with our original concepts and ideas to craft something unique, and the quality of her work was outstanding...

. She was also flexible with last-minute changes due to some indecisiveness on our end, which I appreciated. We will see her soon for sizing optimization and purchasing insurance, so she continues to be supportive and attentive after delivery. Excellent all around!

Altana is incredible! She worked with us for several months on custom engagement rings and wedding bands, culminating in beautiful matching sets with incredible texture and detail....

My rings have excellent excellent weight, fit, and sizing; Altana worked with us through the design phase, as well as test fitting, final finish, and even on-site delivery. We love our rings and would look forward to working with Altana again for future pieces!

eading the positive online reviews we scheduled a visit. I was surprised at how fast they responded back to me and fit us in within 24 hours of reaching out. We felt soo special and comfortable throughout the entire process as was a lot more fun and insightful than we both expected. Altana is so knowledgeable and friendly. We learned a lot and after trying a few options my partner found her perfect ring! Then to make things extra special Altana & Cassandra even helped me surprise my partner by expediting the ring to be ready within a week of our visit which made it possible mee to propose on Christmas Eve. Whether you’re new to the ring process or have visited a few places before we would both recommend Altana as you’ll be in very caring and supportive hands.

We came to Altana with very unclear ideas of what we might want for our wedding bands. She was super patient and guided us with so much care and attention. She has a ton of jewelry...

experience and helped us understand the ins and outs of metals and gemstones. Neither of us wear a lot of jewelry, so it was great to be able to talk through what we would be comfortable with. She is also aces in design and helped us crystallize what we uniquely wanted. We hadn't planned on having rings and we were on a super tight timeline, so we weren't expecting to have the rings in time for our ceremony. Altana really wanted us to have them in time and graciously made space in her schedule for us right before the holidays. She really cares for her community and customers and I would recommend her in a heartbeat to anyone who wants something unique and beautiful.

I went to several jewelers before finding Altana. While they were all fine it felt more like a "pick from our menu" type of experience and I had so many questions and wasn't sure w...

hat I was looking for. Altana was the last jeweler I reached out to and she responded within hours. From the first appointment I knew I had found my jeweler! She was so patient answering all my questions and explaining the experience and all about diamonds and settings in detail. She kept me informed every step of the way and was so helpful in describing the intricacies of the different diamonds in helping me choose the perfect stone. She is passionate about her work and her clients and it shows!

We had a tight deadline for creating our engagement ring, and were set on working with a local jeweler in the Bay Area. We feel so fortunate to have found Altana, and cannot recomm...

end her enough! Communicating with her and her sister Cassandra felt personal and genuine from the start. We knew Altana's style was the right match, with a perfect balance of classic and modern aesthetics. The custom design process was wonderful, and she facilitated a collaborative experience for us that resulted in a beautiful 8 petal prong, peach sapphire ring. The quality and craftsmanship of the ring is outstanding, and reflects Altana's care and thoughtfulness. I am so happy to see Altana's storefront open and thriving in Oakland, and hope that many others choose to have Altana join their ring journey!
