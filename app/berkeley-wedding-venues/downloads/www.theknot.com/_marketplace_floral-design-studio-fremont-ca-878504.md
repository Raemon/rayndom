NONA. IS. THE. BEST. Floral Design Studio came highly recommended to me by a friend who had a great experience with them with her own wedding. I met with Nona once just prior to t...

he pandemic to discuss my options and vision. Then COVID happened. I communicated with Nona via email throughout the remainder of the process and she was very responsive. Nona was extremely understanding and flexible when I needed to make changes to my floral order due to downsizing our wedding. Nona was so kind and said whatever we needed, she was there to help. I only showed Nona a few pictures of what I wanted but really didn't give her much direction. I trusted Nona and her talent to work her magic. And she did not disappoint! My bouquet was absolutely stunning, the centerpieces fit well with our color scheme, and the boutonnieres/corsages were all made beautifully. Everyone was very happy with the flowers. I would definitely recommend Nona and Floral Design Studio for a wedding or any special event and plan to use her services again in the future.

Nona is the BEST florist I could’ve asked for! Flowers at weddings are super important to me - they’re the first thing I notice at any wedding. I don’t know much about flowers, at ...

all (ie, don’t know the names, don’t know how much they cost, don’t know how to arrange even a basic bunch in a basic vase lol). But Nona made my vision for wedding flowers come to life. And we got SOO many compliments from guests about how beautiful our floral arrangements were! During my first meeting with Nona, I had nothing finalized - I showed her my ideas for my bridal gown, bridesmaids dresses, and groom/groomsmen color ideas. I also showed photos of flowers/colors I liked, along with some examples of arrangements I liked from her yelp page. And we reviewed/finalized all those ideas a couple weeks before the wedding. And that was all Nona worked off of to bring my vision to life. I had no clue what I would see the day of, but the moment I saw the flowers, I was 100% satisfied and so very pleased. I kept admiring the flowers every day for as long as they lasted, and even tried to dry as much as I could to make them “last” longer. Additionally, Nona is flexible. I let her know my budget, and she helped me get as close to my budget as possible by making some changes to the initial proposal she sent (ie, shrank the tall/large centerpieces by 2-4 inches, which was fine with me - they were still huge & larger than average!) THANK YOU NONA for helping me create the most beautiful wedding florals I could’ve imagined! I highly recommend her & would use her again for any future floral arrangement needs :)

One of my friends recommended Nona from Floral Design Studio after she had a great experience with her own wedding. I have to chime in with my enthusiastic agreement that Nona is f...

antastic to work with and her flowers are phenomenal. On top of that, she has so many beautiful decor items for rent that it eliminated us needing to go through other rental shops for additional things. We met a couple times in person, first to design the overall look, choose a color scheme, and figure out the amount of floral pieces needed. Just prior to the wedding, we finalized the order and discussed the exact kinds of flowers that would be available. She has many flowers at her studio to give clients a better idea of the color tone and type of flowers that she'll use. As someone not very familiar with gardening or plants, this was super helpful. Also as mentioned in many other reviews, Nona is great at thinking of ways to repurpose ceremony flowers to decorate tables and other locations during cocktail hour and reception. And she and her team helps move them as well. The final quote seemed very reasonable. In particular I have to mention that it was difficult for us to find an arch that I liked, but Nona came through and saved the day with the perfect arch and then decorated it beautifully with drapes and florals. She even helped attach the strings of tissue paper flowers my mom made to the arch as well. Along with her team, she will also do breakdowns right after the ceremony (cleaning up petals, etc) and will return later after the reception for the rest of any rental items. Our venue took care of the rest, but the guests loved the flowers and they all disappeared by the end of the night anyway ;) Would highly recommend Nona for any of your floral needs. She is a wizard with putting together flowers and also staying at the budget you need.

She was very accommodating with our schedule, and even though we couldn't give her as much set up time as she wanted, her team did an incredible job working quickly and professionally to put everything together before the start of the ceremony. They also stayed behind to wait until after the ceremony to move the flowers to our reception area just below. Such service! Nona and her team are absolutely amazing - thank you for your beautiful work and for helping making everything transition smoothly on the day of the wedding!

During our process we were not sure how we wanted our center pieces and reception area decorated and she helped us come up with a beautiful design that fit into our color scheme and BUDGET. The final meeting was days before the wedding and regardless of time frame she still fit in some last minute items that I needed for the wedding. The day of was stress free, all of our bouquets were absolutely beautiful and beyond my expectations. All of the arrangements and decor came together beautifully and she did an outstanding job. She is definitely worth every penny and her warm personality is just the icing on the cake.

d sat at her desk, she was 100% focused! I had a consultation with Nona for personal flowers only (no floral centerpieces, no floral aisle decorations). Nona still gave me a full hour consultation to discuss what type of design I was interested in and even gave me recommendations on how I could keep costs low. I really felt that she was on my side throughout my consultation with her and never made me feel cheap because I was only interested in personal flowers. (I had my own DIY centerpieces). However, because my wedding venue is in Sonoma and her store is in Fremont, logistically pick-up and/or delivery did not make sense. But, I would definitely recommend Nona based off of my consultation with her and having seen the space she uses to make all her arrangements I would use her if I had a wedding closer to the Fremont/San Jose area.

ons about my wedding including the colors, the style and the mood I wanted to set. (all questions that no other florist asked me to bring) She also asked me to bring a photo of my wedding gown and the bridesmaids. When we met she had already brainstormed some ideas and looked at the pictures I bright her and helped me create the look I waned and even matched the style of my dress with the wrap of the flower steams on the bouquets for my bridesmaids. She is very talented and helped me get all the ideas that i had in my head and create a vision in which she elegantly delivered on our wedding day. If I would have met her before I booked my caterer which included our centerpieces in their package, I would have had Nona make those as well, however she did an amazing job with the bridesmaids bouquets, the groomsmen/fathers/grandpas/pastor boutonnieres, the corsages for our moms/grandmas as well as decorating a birdcage which we held out cards and the cake flowers. I loved Nona's work and she was so amazing to work with! She'll help make your day look more beautiful with her floral designs.

Furthermore, she was very reliable and easy to work with. I added hair flowers to my order last minute, which she happily did for me.

so comfortable it was as if we had known each other for years. We seriously considered putting her dog in our wedding. That is how incredible she is. She also tries to help you save money. She has this vision that I don't see it when she's describing it because I'm a visual person but I totally trusted her with everything and it was just how I wanted. When I saw my bouquet on the day of my wedding, I was in awe! I went to her in a panic because I had chose to do my on centerpieces to save money but I couldn't do it. I went to her and she calmed me down and it would have cost me more to do them on my own. She saved me money again! She was absolutely awesome! I also had her provide me the flowers for my wedding cake. I really had no idea of what flowers I wanted on my cake but she took care of it and the cake was beautiful. I would definitely go to her if you have a wedding.

I don't know much about flowers, but she helped put my vision together with photos of the flowers she suggested. Other florists we met with only threw out names of flowers with no photos and I was left dumbfounded not knowing how they looked. We had a lemon raspberry cake, so as part of my brown/yellow colored theme, I wanted to use lemons from our tree as part of the decorations. We had a few centerpieces with lemons and sunflowers. Nona even put a few whole lemons on the venue's ledges and around the cake table as decorations. This was a surprise to us but we absolutely loved it! We received so many compliments from our guests about them and about all our floral decorations. We were extremely pleased with the service and attention to detail and would recommend Floral Design Studio to anyone looking for a florist.

Throughout the planning process, she was extremely considerate and flexible. It was such a pleasure to work with her.

Nona is simply the BEST! She's really pleasant to work with. She's very perceptive, as she was able to grasp what I had in mind in terms of the the look-and-feel-and-mood that I ...

was going for. I was thrilled with her ideas! She's got wonderful vision and creativity. Then, about 3 weeks before the wedding, we had to change our room -- from a formal parlor with a grand fireplace and heavy draperies, to an enclosed garden/patio -- she never even missed a beat; she just said "no problem" and switched gears without any drama. Her revised design was breathtaking. It was fresh and airy, while also being elegant and sophisticated. There was a large HVAC duct overhead, and I suggested that we hang some crystals from it, in order to sort of camouflage it. She liked that idea, but wasn't sure quite how she would do it. I left it in her hands. The way she ended up hanging them was simply spectacular! She made the duct-work beautiful! There was a black baby-grand piano in the room, and she created a grand arrangement in a very tall vase which was breathtaking. My hubby and I are foodies and cooks, so she also created a unique arrangement for the sign-in table that consisted almost exclusively of edibles. I just can't recommend Nona's Floral Design Studio strongly enough.

I can't speak highly enough of Floral Design Studio, they are the best possible florist you can hire in the bay area. From the beginning to the end of our wedding process Nona and ...

her staff were extremely professional, flexible, artistic, amazing, and reasonable! I truly believe that flowers create the wedding atmosphere. When I walked into Nona's office, I not only got a florist willing to work with my vision and budget, I got an artist with ideas that were beyond my highest expectations!! Once it came to the wedding day and actual set up and display of the flowers we were beyond elated!! Floral Design Studio created everything from alter arrangements, to centerpieces for 20 table, and little touches I couldn't even imagine!! I received so many compliments on our flowers and our pictures turned out amazing!! Thank you so much Nona and to your staff!! We would without a doubt recommend you to anyone with floral needs, you are the best!! Kimya

Nona has an amazing talent for designing both large and small flower arrangements that are unique and stunning. Other designers I interviewed asked me what flowers I wanted and sh...

owed me many books but none gave me constructive advice. Nona listened to what I wanted and then came up with a beautiful vision for our wedding day. She was also very accommodating to some last-minute changes I made. I would recommend Nona in a heartbeat.

I am so glad that I went with Floral Design Studio to do the flowers for our wedding. I went in not knowing everything I was looking for, and Nona had great ideas to complement min...

e. She really knows what she's doing and was able to draw up some sketches to give me an idea of what things would look like. She was also so friendly and easy to work with! On the big day, when our flowers arrived, I was blown away. They were even more beautiful than I could have imagined! They were just what I wanted and more. We've gotten a lot of compliments on how beautiful they looked. Also, the Floral Design Studio staff was very friendly and helpful the day of the wedding. They even stayed to move some flowers from the ceremony to the reception. I would recommend Floral Design Studio to anyone looking for great flowers and great service!

I cannot express enough how fortunate we were to have been recommended to Nona Tai by our wedding coordinator, Debbie Rino Santos. All it took was visiting Nona 2 times at her stu...

dio! One time was to share our budget (which was humble), our color, (between a cornflower and midnight blue) and our overall tone of the wedding (simple and elegant). And the second time was to confirm colors, vases, time frames, and payment. Nona took it from there! She showed us beautiful, in-season flower options in our hues of blues, what the latest design trends were versus what is classical beautiful, and empowered us to do some steps ourselves with her guidance. It was just the kind of balance my husband and I needed to convince us that, yes, flowers Could be doable at our wedding, and that we were not going to break our bank on these fresh floral arrangements for one gorgeous day. I am SO grateful for Nona's expertise and collaboration with our cake decorator too- she knew exactly what to do to top our cake with style. One more thing- I LOVED my bouquet and am so happy every time I look at it in pictures!

Nona works magic with flowers! She is very professional and a pleasure to work with. She always responded to my emails right away and she tolerated my many color palette changes :)...

Her prices are also very reasonable for what she delivers. The florist I had planned on hiring before I met Nona was charging way more for the same arrangements! The 4 star review though is for the arrangements she made for the ceremony. They were beautiful and they were the flowers we discussed, but WAAAY too small to even make a difference. I thought she had told us she'd been to St. Ignatius church before so I thought she knew how huge the church was, but judging from the pew arrangements, she didn't. Definitely could of saved some money if I knew that she was envisioning such small arrangements. Good thing the graduation from that morning had huge flower arrangements that were left in place for the wedding, otherwise it'd look like there were no flowers at all! Reception, bridesmaids bouquets, boutennieres, and my bouquet were ON POINT though! Gorgeous arrangements. I'd still definitely recommend her to everyone!

Two of my friends used Nona as their florist in their weddings, back in 2003 and they had nothing but wonderful things to say about Nona and her flowers. We met with several flor...

ists before deciding to go with Nona. We were so glad we did and would recommend her to everyone! She gave us wonderful suggestions on how to get the most out of our modest budget. She suggested going with flowers that were in season. I even supplied all our vases for our reception tables (we had 25). Pink and Orange were my wedding colors and a lot of people were a little skeptical, even my husband, but Nona was not. She took those colors and ran with it. I was just blown away by Nona on my wedding day, from the bouquets, to the centerpieces, the ceremony flowers, the cake flowers...even the boutinerres and corsages. Words can't describe how beautiful the flowers were on my wedding day. Thank you so much Nona! Also, Nona gets an A+ on her communication! She's always so quick to respond to all our emails and phone calls. I never had to follow up with her on anything. She was always on top of things!

My husband and I got engaged in mid-February, and scrambled to plan for our wedding in late August. After searching 3 weeks for a reasonably-priced florist whose style I actually l...

iked, I found Nona &amp; FDS through my sister- she'd done her wedding 7 years earlier. I remembered her outstanding work from 2003, and she remembered my sister! Unbelievable. She was so fun &amp; great to work with, as well as her assistants. She gave great suggestions in making ceremony arrangements that not only honored my culture, but could also be used again (but very differently) for the reception. She was super patient &amp; very organized. Her assistants were wonderful as well- thanks Molly for all the emailing back &amp; forth! A big plus was how she designed my 1-yr old niece's "bouquet". I thought of a flower ball because that's what I've seen used most but was worried about a 1-yr old handling it. I've heard horror stories about those balls falling apart. Instead, Nona gave her a fun fairy wand with one very large &amp; beautiful rose on top- my niece loved it! Waved it around everywhere and held it just like all the bridesmaids held their bouquets. Everyone raved about the flowers! Our guests all said they'd never seen floral centerpieces done the way she did ours. Nona even provided some beautiful mirrors after we found out the hotel didn't carry them anymore- at no extra cost! And her price, the same as it was when my sister got married. No joke- I checked!! For 20 candelabra wreath arrangements, 20-30 corsages &amp; boutonnieres, 5 bouquets, and 20 wreaths transported to the hotel &amp; transformed into 20 centerpieces with floating petals &amp; votives, we paid well under $3000. If you check around, that's a steal! All in all, Nona was amazing to work with. She's engaging, fun, has great vision, and is so accommodating &amp; understanding with her clients. She's upfront &amp; honest- what she quotes is what she charges, and she's consistent too. The quality of her work is outstanding- she really puts her heart &amp; soul into her arrangements. Thanks in large part to FDS, we had a beautiful wedding &amp; beautiful pictures to show for it! We love you Nona!!

Nona (owner) my preliminary contract was about 2x more than I had expected to spend on flowers so there were some things I had to cut back on, but Nona worked with me. Half of the centerpieces were done by Floral Design Studio which were orchids in a trio of tall cylinder vases filled with gel/water and a candle on top.. everyone loved it and wanted to take them home! My bouquet was beautiful and simple.. just the way i like it... I was able to dry it and frame it as well. The bridesmaid's bouquets were cute and lovely as well and complimented their dresses. Nona was wonderful to work with and always responded to my emails promptly. Thank you, Nona!!

As soon as I walked into Nona's Shop I knew she was going to be my Florist. I had been to other florist before and they didn't see my vision of Stargazer lillies and Orchids. Nona...

had the most beautiful Stargazer lillies fresh in her shop the day I walked in! She made my vision come true for my wedding flowers! She has beautiful arrays of every orchid you could imagine and her romantic and contemporary style was perfect-Not too busy but the perfect amount of romantic elagance! She was very honest with my decisions always giving me great insight but never shooting down my ideas. She is very complimentary with her style and arrangements to what your dream wedding flowers are going to look like. Her quality of flowers, her sweet personality and hard work makes her one of my favorite vendors from my wedding. I am definitly recommending her to others! She is also the best value for your flowers-trust me I shopped around. We had 200 people attend and she made ever aspect of the wedding gorgeous from mine and my bridesmaids bouqets to the ceremony and reception flowers. I loved my bouqet and all of the beautiful high and low centerpieces on our tables. Our Arbor was so beautiful and she was able to bring it in for our head table as well! I am going to be giving her pictures from our wedding if you want to sample her work -it is everything I dreamed of!

Nona is the best florist and after meeting with her for the first time I just knew she was the one - especially after meeting with other florists in the Bay Area. She did our wed...

ding on October 2nd and everything was simply gorgeous. I started looking for a florist 6 months before the wedding, and after a lot of back and forth I just wasn't confident with the way things were going. When a florist starts asking for pictures of what you like, rather than understand your vision and what you are trying to achieve, you just know something isn't right and so, my search continued to the point that I was almost giving up until I met Nona 2 weeks before the wedding - yep, 2 weeks, so the stress level I was in and also my frustration was very high. Before our meeting, she asked me to bring a picture of my dress and I brought our wedding invitation so she could see the color scheme we were going after. I spent 1 1/2 hours with her and she completely understood what I wanted and never asked me for any floral photos. She just knew what I was trying to achieve and took it to a completely different level. I wish I would have found Nona when I first started looking for a florist, because it would have saved me a lot of time and stress. She also gave us so many ideas and design elements on the color of the linens to bring out the color of the flowers. I loved my bouquet, which complimented beautifully my dress and so did my bridesmaids. All the floral arrangements were beautiful and we received so many compliments.

a farm wedding - how unique of me). Instantly she sketched a concept centerpiece and started listing all the great flowers that could go with it. She was a lifesaver when she agreed to come TWICE to the wedding site just because of my cake, which couldn't be out for more than an hour before we served it. She was also very cost-conscious and helped us save money in the right places without compromising on style and beauty. I don't know what we we would have done without her! Thank you Nona!!

I didn't have a specific budget for my flowers but it all worked out since the prices were pretty reasonable. Nona was also very flexible to last minute changes so that was a big plus. It was definitely a positive experience of my wedding day. The flowers on my special day were so brilliant from the wedding bouquet to the boutonnieres, the centerpieces - the guests loved them so much that by the end of the night, they were all gone- which is the best compliment one florist can receive. Thanks Nona and her team for contributing in making my special day as smooth as it did.

pulled through! We gave her a budget and she completely worked with us with the pricing and the presentation! We ended up getting amaz-ball ceter pieces for our traditional reception she created this orchid chandelier drop inside a tall cylinder container with crystals at the bottom. EVERYONE loved them! I can't even tell you how many complements we got on the center pieces! The bouquets were lovely! I just told her what kind of flowers I wanted and colors and she completely designed something that was exactly what I wanted timeless and classy and girly all at the same time! I cannot tell you how much I love the flowers! For our Chinese reception she created red floating orchids in the same cylinder vases. They were perfect as well! everyone loved them and complemented us on them as well! All and All the flowers were a BIG hit! and i'm completely satisfied with the amount we spend she kept our budget in mind and work with us through the entire thing! The flowers looked like we spend 10's of thousands instead of a couple thousand!

Nona also doesnt use pins for the corsages, she has these great magnets! So there is no poking into your mom's dress! She also threw in a flower arrangement of peonys that matched my bouquet since we didnt use a toss bouquet (which is complimentary). The fact that anything was complimentary was nice.. i rarely hear of any florist throwing items in. I would definitely recommend Nona to any bride to be.

Nona really is wonderful to work with. I used yelp and websites like the knot to check out which vendors were the best for me to work with and Nona lived up to all the rave reviews...

. She was organized and the delivery of the flower arrangements she made were above and beyond what I expected. In fact, the centerpiece that I had in mind was so simple and she held true to the essential design, but far exceeded my imagination in what she delivered. The prices are also reasonable and quality is dependable. The flowers really added to the magic of my wedding day and I will always remember how Nona made sure to keep it special.
