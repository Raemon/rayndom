## What Is a Semi-Naked Wedding Cake?

You can think of a semi-naked cake as a sort of peekaboo cake. The sponge cake layers and filling are left slightly unfrosted, leaving them to "peek" randomly throughout the wedding cake design. This cake style is achieved by spreading a thinner amount of buttercream or frosting than would normally be used—it's similar to a crumb coat, which is a [cake decorating technique](https://www.theknot.com/content/a-glossary-of-wedding-cake-terms) used by bakers to quickly coat the cake with frosting before adding a smoother, more thorough layer. In this case, the crumb coat acts as the final and only layer of frosting. Semi-naked cakes are different from [naked wedding cakes](https://www.theknot.com/content/naked-cake-designs), which don't have any frosting at all (unless it's part of the cake filling).

## Semi-Naked Wedding Cake Ideas

Ready to start imagining how you actually want your dessert table to look? Check out some of these beautiful wedding cake ideas from real couples.

### 1\. Semi-Naked Chocolate Cake with Roses 

![three tier semi naked wedding cake with blush roes and white ranunculus](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/217b6d70-bf01-45d4-91a0-03798f7b4eda~rs_768.h-cr_0.341.2048.3072)

_[Photography: Danielle Bennink](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/danielle-bennink-gendora-ca-848529),__Cake: Petit Sweets_

Blush pink roses accented this sweet, three-tiered cake with chocolate sponge peeking through, creating a faux bois effect that feels rustic yet chic.

### 2\. Whimsical Semi-Naked Wedding Cake 

![two tier semi naked wedding cake with eucalyptus and fringe pennant banner cake topper](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/e33cc169-6004-4afa-918d-7aa80c2ebf04~rs_768.h-cr_0.649.3214.4934)

_[Photography: Jenny Haas Photography](https://www.jennyhaas.com/),__[Cake: Blush Arrow Cakes](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/blush-arrow-cakes-columbus-oh-870817)_

If a boho wedding theme is more your style, top off your cake with a playful bunting banner with macrame tassels and fresh eucalyptus.

### 3\. Four-Tier Semi-Naked Wedding Cake with Fresh Fruit 

![four tier chocolate semi naked wedding cake with grapes, apples and sliced oranges](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/45bf7368-789a-498d-bd15-8e38897e7d92~rs_768.h-cr_0.444.2667.4000)

We love fresh fruit as a wedding cake garnish, not only because of how it looks, but because you can eat it too, so nothing goes to waste. Use a variety of berries, grapes, apples and citrus fruits to bring in all the color.

### 4\. Three-Tiered Wedding Cake with Geometric Design 

![modern semi naked wedding cake with geometric shapes on fondant bottom tier ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/42bb3eb7-6519-4823-9259-525de40239c7~rs_768.h-cr_0.180.1080.1620)

_[Photography: Wyeth Augustine](https://wyethaugustine.com/)_

You don't have to decorate all of the tiers on your cake with semi-naked frosting. Cover the bottom tier with fondant and a bold design, like these geometric shapes, to create an eye-catching base.

### 5\. Pink Macaron Semi-Naked Wedding Cake 

![two tier semi naked wedding cake decorated with pink macarons and greenery sprigs](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/dd520a3a-e938-4138-984f-361b906e600a~rs_768.h-cr_0.619.3715.5572)

Give your semi-naked cake a hint of Parisian flair by adding macarons or meringues as decorations. The best part? Your cake baker can customize them in any color to match your wedding decor.

### 6\. Unique Semi-Naked Wedding Cake with Tilted Tiers 

![unique four tier wedding cake with tilted tiers and flowers in between each tier](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/ec012524-8dfe-4f56-8cde-d011c06b1d48~rs_768.h-cr_94.455.1944.2922)

The tilted tiers of this cake instantly add a unique, whimsical element to the design. Fresh flowers in between each tier bring in color and texture.

### 7\. Mostly-Naked Wedding Cake Adorned with Berries

![Naked Wedding Cake Decorated With Fresh Berries](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/f8ff2111-653f-4e00-a182-95932295b2ef~rs_768.h-cr_29.0.995.1288)

_[Photography: Amber Marie Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/amber-marie-photography-pittsburgh-pa-256838),__Cake: Cake Ambition_

If you're not relying on traditional frosting to decorate your wedding cake, you can use a cascade of flowers instead. Clusters of cream, white and blush garden roses wrap around the front of this cake, giving it an elegant, romantic look.

### 9\. Red Velvet Naked Cake with Pez Cake Topper

![Red Velvet Naked Cake with Pez Cake Topper](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/df728af2-2a03-4822-800c-c34b87127aee~rs_768.h-cr_0.9.1026.1377)

_[Photography: Lauren Fair Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/lauren-fair-photography-pennsburg-pa-396575)_

Considering a totally naked wedding cake? A red velvet is a great way to go about it. Without frosting in the way, the bold crimson layers take the stage. It's striking, romantic and dramatic in the best possible way.

### 10\. Classic Three-Tier Semi-Naked Wedding Cake 

![classic three tier semi naked wedding cake with white roses and votive candles](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/6920511e-5764-4767-ae0c-5d809da0c7cf~rs_768.h-cr_106.51.1080.1350)

While half-naked cakes are often thought of as being super trendy, you can make them classic with the right approach. Decorated with timeless white roses and votive candles, this three-tier cake is sophisticated and chic.

### 11\. Semi-Naked Cake Idea for Winter Wedding 

![three tier semi naked wedding cake with blackberries, raspberries and white roses](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/d8d8e033-afe9-46c2-9ede-317b297d50c7~rs_768.h-cr_0.367.2200.3300)

_[Photography: Kristen Nicole Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/kristen-nicole-photography-sylvania-oh-284667),__Cake: Earth to Oven Bakery_

Raspberries, blackberries and mint leaves evoke a festive, wintry look when paired together on your wedding cake. An optional dusting of powdered sugar is an easy way to finish the design with a snow-inspired detail.

### 12\. Modern Boho Semi-Naked Wedding Cake 

![modern three tier semi naked wedding cake on whitewashed wooden table decorated with blush roses and bleached greenery](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/a06873e6-0c79-4c26-906d-5ac346ff8ee9~rs_768.h-cr_132.244.4222.5697)

Bleached ferns, blush roses, mismatched candlesticks and a whitewashed wooden table all contribute to this dessert station's boho, shabby chic vibe.

### 13\. Naked Carrot Cake with Custom Topper

Don't just think outside of the box when it comes to frosting your wedding cake—get creative with the garnishes too. For a fall wedding, colorful autumn leaves are a great way to tap into the season (just ask your florist to help you source clean, food-safe options).

### 24\. Semi-Naked Wedding Cake with Fondant Tier 

![white wedding cake with bottom fondant tier and two tiers with semi naked frosting decorated with red peony](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/179ea3f3-3541-4d98-b28b-f1179636dc0f~rs_768.h-cr_38.148.1024.1463)

### 25\. Summer Wedding Cake with White Flowers

This sweet and simple semi-naked wedding cake is an excellent choice for couples who don't want anything too flashy. The mix of dark and light cake paired with white icing and flowers gives it an elegant and understated look that won't overwhelm your wedding photos.

This semi-naked wedding cake is all about the floral decoration and personalized cake topper. Keeping the base simple allows for these extra elements to pop. 

### 31\. Semi-Naked Wedding Cake with Pops of Red

A semi-naked wedding cake with pops of vibrant red flowers is basically romance served on a platter. The minimal frosting lets the natural texture of the cake peek through, while those bold red blooms add just the right amount of drama.

### 32\. Semi-Naked Cake with Pink Cabbage Roses

Looking for quaint semi-naked wedding cakes? The type of flowers you choose can make all of the difference. While the pink cabbage roses are minimal, the effect they give is soft, romantic and vintage (kind of like your cake wandered straight out of an English garden). 

### 33\. Semi-Naked Cake with Sliced Figs

Figs are a go-to ingredient for autumn and winter cuisine, and they just so happen to look lovely on wedding cakes too. Keep them whole and use a few as a seasonal cake topper, or slice them and place them around the edge of each tier.

### 34\. All-White Wedding Cake with Pampas Grass

Dark-colored cake flavors, like chocolate, will naturally bring more contrast to the thin layer of buttercream. Play up the brown tones by adding earthy accents, like pampas grass, a wooden cake stand and a gauzy table runner.
