I recently stayed at The Mansion on Sutter during my visit to San Francisco, and it was truly a beautiful experience. I stayed in The Juliet Room, which was elegant, comfortable, and full of charm. The service throughout my stay was excellent, ...

everything felt thoughtful and top-notch. The front desk was absolutely exquisite, and I want to give a special shoutout to Amanda. She was incredibly helpful and so trustworthy. I really appreciated her kindness and professionalism. She made me feel right at home. I definitely plan to stay here again on my next trip to the city. I loved the staff, the atmosphere, and the attention to detail. Highly recommend!

The mansion has been around since before the 1906 earthquake so I figured it would have historic charm, but I didn't expect it would be so beautifully restored inside, with brand new high quality furnishings throughout. We were also very well t...

I had the best stay at the Mansion on Sutter. The hotel is in a perfect location — central but quiet and safe, which made it incredibly convenient and relaxing. My room was spacious, spotless, and thoughtfully designed, making it a perfect plac...

The hotel is advertised as 5 stars other than the price and the setting it is anything but. Unfortunately the hotel seems to be closing down changing ownership or just gone completely down hill. It came highly recommended but a 5 star hotel sho...

uld offer a certain standard which this hotel did not. The decor is stunning the rooms comfortable. However, there seems to be minimal staff running round doing everything. You walk in to a closed restaurant an empty bar with no bartender. The rooms are comfortable but they sometimes don’t even make the bed a bare minimum in my opinion for any hotel let alone a 5 star hotel. there isn’t even a fridge or mini bar in the room. The poorest of it all is the lack of breakfast there is literally just a bagel, cheese and yogurt and some days they don’t even bother doing that. The chairs were stacked in the room as if it was closing down, the paintings off the wall the hotel feels almost abandoned. Really disappointed for a hotel that charges $300 a night. Unfortunately it’s a 5 star advertised and priced but 3 star offering at best.
