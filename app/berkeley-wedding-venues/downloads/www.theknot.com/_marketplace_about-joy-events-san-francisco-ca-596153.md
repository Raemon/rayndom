Jackie Chaban

Events Director

I have been planning my friends and family events for many years. My official wedding business started after my own wedding in 2010, when my husband's friends started asking me to help plan their weddings. I have worked in different industries but always feel happiest in the hospitality field. I look forward to working with happy couples planning their dream event.

We could not be more grateful for Jackie and Cookie! They are truly the dream team that made our wedding everything we envisioned and more. From the start, they understood our visi...

on for a funky garden party and brought it to life with such heart, creativity, and precision. A special shout-out to Cookie, our design genius, who went above and beyond to craft a cohesive, personalized aesthetic that reflected who we are as a couple. Every single detail from the florals to the tablescapes to the custom Tony’s Chocalonelys felt intentional, joyful, and effortlessly “us.” Cookie somehow managed to balance whimsy with elegance, creating an atmosphere that our guests are still raving about. Jackie was equally incredible, keeping everything running smoothly and making sure we were relaxed, present, and able to actually enjoy our day. Together, they made the planning process feel fun, organized, and stress-free. If you’re looking for planners who care about you as more than clients, but as family and will do just about anything to give you the best day of your life, hire About Joy Events!

We LOVED working with Jackie and Cookie of About Joy. If we could, we would give them a 10 out of 5 star rating for how much they went above and beyond for us. Even before we off...

icially hired her, Jackie was acting like our wedding planner, and immediately began throwing out ideas that showcased our main focus for our wedding (delicious food and a beautiful outdoor venue). We could tell right from our first call that Jackie was truly excited about our vision and “got it.” From there, Jackie was a true creative/collaborative partner, and helped make our special day a reality. Jackie brought a wealth of knowledge and wisdom to our planning - while she was always encouraging of our vision and would find a way to make my crazy ideas possible, she also was quick to offer a reality check based on her extensive experience (ex: she very smartly and politely informed us that using scented candles at our reception - while trendy - would likely summon bees and might get overwhelming given all the other floral scents in the garden reception area). We almost exclusively used vendors from Jackie’s recommended list and each and every one did an absolutely stellar job. Jackie also did a phenomenal job of working with our outside vendors, and was even able to use her extensive professional network to solicit feedback on vendors we wanted to use outside of her list. She made the wedding process seamless and significantly less stressful than if we planned it ourselves, which allowed us to truly enjoy our wedding weekend and be present with our family and friends - if anything went wrong on our big day, we had no clue because About Joy had it handled! Once we had finalized all the major items with Jackie, Cookie worked closely with us to pull together details that added a very special touch to our wedding. She custom designed and drew our wedding signage, table numbers and menus to showcase our unique tastes and personalities. We had an outdoor venue and wanted to incorporate the plant life from the venue in our wedding materials, and Cookie drew 12 separate custom menu covers and table numbers that highlighted this plant life, and then hid custom sketches of our dog (in different adorable poses!) into each table number to bring in one of the important pieces of our life to our wedding - we love the designs so much they’re going to be framed and put up in our home! Throughout the design journey, Cookie brought us along and solicited feedback, always taking our garbled thoughts and seamlessly translating them into a beautiful end product. She also brought so many unique ideas and suggestions to the table, including turning our escort table into a “meadow” and hiding our dog in the signage. It’s clear that Cookie is passionate about design and her excitement for our wedding specifically really helped sustain our own energy & enthusiasm in the final months leading up to the big day. Jackie and Cookie were truly dream wedding planners, and were lucky to say that they’re now friends for life. Would 100% recommend hiring Jackie and Cookie from AboutJoy for your wedding!

hat instantly made my husband and I feel like we were in the best hands. Wedding planning can be overwhelming (especially within the last month of planning), but with them, it felt manageable, thoughtful, and soooo fun. They are the perfect balance of detail-oriented and big-picture thinkers. About Joy Events / Jackie & Cookie were anticipating our needs before we even voiced them, kept everything running smoothly behind the scenes, and made sure no detail (big or small) slipped through the cracks. On the day of the wedding, they were absolute pros: calm, efficient, and somehow everywhere at once, while making it feel effortless to us. What truly sets Jackie and Cookie apart is how much they care. They allowed us to be fully present and enjoy every moment, knowing everything was handled seamlessly. We are so grateful for them and couldn’t recommend them enough!!!

She printed out signs for us, collected small things here and there (bouquets, speakers, speaker stands, etc). Brought the items to all the locations, coordinated with all the vendors, and made sure everything was in place by the time we got there. Our wedding went SO smoothly in the end, everyone told us it felt effortless and had a lot of fun. This is largely thanks to Jackie and her team!

We were introduced to Jackie less than 2.5 months before our daughter's bat mitzvah at a time when we recognized our original planner was not going to work out. I feel SO LUCKY th...

at we had an opportunity to work with Jackie and Cookie. Some brides/grooms may disagree, but I honestly believe Mitzvah planning is more complex than a wedding- a service, a party that appeals to both kids and adults, etc. So, if About Joy could deliver on our event, I am 1000% confident they deliver on amazing weddings. They listened to our vision and ideas for a broadway themed bat mitzvah party and not only executed but provided suggestions to make it even better...from introducing us to an amazing caterer, to finding our a pianist to accompany our broadway singer, to painting the stage door that we used as the sign-in board to creating a logo for our sweatshirts that every 13 yr old guest wears with pride, there was no detail left undone. We wanted this to be a joyful event and with Jackie and Cookie-- it was an 11 of the 1-10 joy scale. I miss them both dearly and can't wait to do another event with them! My guests commented on how they saw me enjoying every moment of the event- being so present and engaged- and that was because I knew Jackie and Cookie had all the details handled.

Jackie from About Joy Events did an amazing job for our SF City Hall wedding. From the moment we engaged her services, it was clear that we were in capable hands. We chose Jackie b...

ecause she had a City Hall package, which showcased her expertise in organizing City Hall ceremonies and receptions at Wayfare Tavern. And she did not disappoint! As she guided us through the process, Jackie's wealth of knowledge about the venues and her organizational skills put us at ease. She effortlessly coordinated with our chosen vendors, ensuring that everything fell into place perfectly. On the big day itself, Jackie coordinated the ceremony at City Hall, while her assistant Cookie managed the reception setup. Their detailed planning and execution ensured that our guests remained on schedule so that everything went off without a hitch. A few months later, we brought her back to help plan and organize a traditional Chinese wedding banquet. Once more, Jackie went above and beyond, providing valuable support in navigating family dynamics and unforeseen circumstances. Jackie is so thoughtful, outgoing, and brings a lot of fun to the process. It's clear that Jackie genuinely cares about her couples and their happiness. We are very thankful that we found Jackie and About Joy Events and would 100% recommend their services to the next happy couple. Thank you, Jackie, for making our wedding day and subsequent celebrations truly unforgettable! A + C

Jackie and Cookie were fantastic. From our first call, I felt like Jackie got “us.” She didn’t try to push us in any direction we weren’t comfortable in, and was really respectful ...

of our price point. In fact, she gave us really good feedback about areas that were worth our investment, and others that she would recommend we don’t spend money on. For example, we didn’t want to prioritize florals, and Jackie connected us to a fabulous florist who worked with us to create floral arrangements within our budget that also looked beautiful (and lasted for a long time!). We also hesitated on hiring a DJ, and Jackie talked us through the tradeoffs of not having a DJ. In the end, she connected us to a DJ who was wonderful - in fact, we got a lot of compliments on the music. She also helped us get really good rates on hotel blocks, and recommended our photographer who we loved. Leading up to the day and on the day, Jackie made sure we were completely taken care of. She even helped wipe down all of the chairs when it rained right before our ceremony! If you’re looking for someone who can provide you with quality guidance, support, and vendor recommendations, I highly recommend Jackie. We’re so happy we got to work with her (and Cookie!).

We met Jackie through a preferred vendor list and felt a genuine connection with her since our first phone call. We are from Texas and wanted to have our wedding in San Francisco. ...

She helped us navigate around the city and find our dream venue at the Mark Hopkins Hotel. She is extremely professional and has many connections within the wedding industry. We did not have to worry about searching for vendors, she gave us many options and once we picked one, she was on top of it! She is very genuine and guided us in the best direction, with also making sure to stick within our budget. Now, I came to Jackie with no vision for our wedding at all, no color scheme, no nothing in mind, just that it needed to be in SF. She took my blank vision and turned in into a masterpiece of a wedding! We had our ceremony at City Hall, our cocktail hour at the Top of The Mark, and reception in the Room of the Dons! Top tier service! Jackie took any stress I had off of me, I didn’t have much to worry about because I knew she had everything under control. The day of the wedding went so well, all of our guest were very impressed with how smooth everything had gone. There was not one mishap and if there was we did not know because Jackie had it all under control. She also had everything on hand that day too, mints for our guest during the ceremony, water and snacks for me, and later I found out she had also sewed one of our guest dresses with floss! She took care of us and our family as if it was her own! Trust me, Jackie is the wedding planner you want, that you need! You will not regret it!

Every time I had a question or anxiety crept up Jackie was there to calm it down. On the day of the wedding, Jackie ran things, kept tabs on the vendors, and made sure the show was moving forward, while wonderful Cookie helped calm me down and helped me change outfits, stayed with me so that I could regulate myself.

Jackie is everything you would want your wedding coordinator to be. She is experienced in the industry, kind, assertive, reassuring, and quick to respond. Jackie has your back. She...

steered me in the right direction when I needed help with finding various vendors. Through her, I ended up choosing my DJ, florist, transportation, and cake vendors. I loved working with them all. During the day of my wedding, she was not feeling her best, but she still constantly communicated with me from the start to the end of the day. She showed up to coordinate my City Hall ceremony and though she could not make my reception due to not feeling well (rare in her case), her colleague Cookie handled everything amazingly. I highly recommend Jackie for your wedding. I miss her now that my wedding is over.

Jackie (and Cookie!) are absolutely fantastic. My husband and I got married in November 2022, and we hired About Joy in the beginning of 2021. We spoke to a number of planners and ...

Jackie stood out from her enthusiasm, honesty, openness, and energy. We could tell immediately that she loved what she did and would really put her all into planning our wedding. We hired them for full service planning, which meant they could dedicate a lot of time and energy into our plans because they don’t have many full service clients in a year. Their pricing was also very reasonable for what we got in the full service package compared to some others. Jackie was the one who found our venue for us, which in itself was worth the money - I never would have known about it otherwise! Jackie and Cookie made the trip out to the venue (over an hour drive for them) multiple times with us for viewings and tastings. The parts of the wedding that we got the most compliments on - decor, DJ, food, venue - were all Jackie. She has a great eye for design and an awesome network of vendors in the area which made things super streamlined because she had worked with the majority of them before. One thing that sticks out was the fact that we had to make plans for heating lamps less than a week before the wedding date, because the weather was forecast to be colder than expected. Jackie coordinated everything related to that last minute. We had such an incredible day that went off without a hitch - it was truly the best day ever. I wish I could plan another wedding with Jackie and Cookie!!

Jackie and Cookie were absolutely God sent! After attempting to use another planner and the venue fell through last minute I was left scrambling. I called several wedding planners...

, I kept getting turned away due to such short notice. Not Jackie. She swooped in and immediately started giving recommendations on venues and caterers. Our wedding wouldn’t have happened without her, I had no idea what I was doing. She found us phenomenal vendors- a photographer, caterers, hair and makeup, and flowers. Everything went smoothly, she is organized, she thinks of everything, she’s honest, and best of all she is passionate and loves what she does. Anytime I felt stressed about the upcoming day she put the wind back in my sail and brought the excitement back. Aside from marrying my best friend, hiring Joy Events was the second best decision I made for our day. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts Jackie and Cookie for making our day so so special.

We appreciated her creative ideas and her guidance with questions we had. The day of she did a wonderful job (along with her assistant) setting up our venue and even the DIY floral set up we had decided on! We couldn’t have made it through the day without her help!

Jackie was an invaluable resource from the minute we hired her. Most of our wonderful vendors were from her recommended list, and she was so helpful with my many questions throughout the planning process. On our wedding day, Jackie and Cookie made sure everything ran seamlessly. We could relax and fully enjoy our wedding day knowing that we were in Jackie’s expert hands. It was truly a joy to work with her, and our wedding was everything we dreamed it would be. Thank you, Jackie!!

You know that feeling when everything clicks on a first date, and you know that relationship's going to work out wonderfully? And then you go on one or two dates with other people ...

because you're "supposed to see what your options are", but you know right away that those aren't going to work out? That was exactly how my wife and I felt after our first call with Jackie. We got in touch with her while looking for help with wedding planning after our jobs devolved into twelve-plus hour days of corporate mayhem, and we couldn't be happier that we did. (We had two other initial calls with other planners. They were lovely people, but we knew we were set on Jackie.) From the first call, it was clear Jackie understood what we wanted our wedding to be and the kind of support we'd need to make it real. And boy, did she follow through. Every single one of her vendor recommendations (photographers, florist, makeup artist, DJ) worked out amazingly for us- both in terms of the quality of their work (top notch!) and in their personalities (absolute gems of people!). Every phone call left us confident nothing had slipped through the cracks- Jackie's excitement and attention to detail really shined through. If we had a particular opinion about something, she made sure it happened; if we didn't, she had tons of beautiful ideas for us to consider. Her dedication to making sure our wedding was perfect was unreal: One of our signature cocktails featured cucumber, so she special-ordered ten pounds of it from "her guy at the farmer's market" to make sure we'd have plenty day of. We wanted dim sum desserts for our wedding, so she toured dim sum restaurants all around San Francisco to find the best ones she could. (Spoiler: my very-much-a-tiger-mom mom was impressed.) As for the wedding day itself: utterly seamless. (I really mean this: people from our wedding party have since been in other weddings, and continue to comment on how calm and organized our wedding was. We did none of that; it was all Jackie.) We were able to relax, stay present, and enjoy each moment of our wedding, and we can't thank Jackie (and Cookie!) enough for all of the work they put into making our wedding day the best it could be.

She helped ease my nerves when I texted her at like 4am the morning of my wedding that I didn't think I could walk down the aisle with my dress with m parents (because it was too big and poofy). On the big day, she said to my wedding party that she apologizes for putting her mean face/attitude on, but I didn't think she was mean at all. She was professional and she got things DONE. The day couldn't have gone on without her and her sister Cookie. Even after the wedding, Jackie is still there for us to help us navigate some logistic issues we had with one vendor. Jackie pointed out to us that the vendor didn't deliver common services and she wanted us to make sure we wouldn't be overcharged. Highly recommend her. We love you Jackie!

g with Jackie, even about the most stressful parts of planning, was frequently the highlight of my day because of what a great energy and spirit she brings to every interaction. I could just go on and on forever--she always had brilliant ideas for every scenario and hiccup. You can tell in the back of her mind her wheels are always spinning to come up with more ideas, thoughts and touches to make sure your event is as special and personalized as it can possibly be. She knows the industry and its vendors backward-and-forward. Our engagement was rather protracted due to COVID-19, (and we had a last-minute venue change, yikes!) but Jackie never lost her patience nor her zestful energy, and instead remained steadfastly dedicated to the event, constantly going above and beyond. I felt from the first phone call she truly values getting to know a couple and figuring out what's going to make them happy. I'm eternally grateful to About Joy Events for ensuring that such an important event was truly special, memorable, and stress free day-of-- particularly as stakes and tensions can tend to run high for weddings these days. Last thing I'll say: Jackie is magic. She doesn't eyeroll or get defeatist, dismissive or negative-- she embraces input and makes things happen! I simply can't express how glad I was to have her magic on my side leading up to, and through, our wedding day.

As we got closer to our wedding day, Jackie made sure we had every detailed lined up, including things my husband and I didn't even consider. She helped take care of signage, shipping, confirming with vendors, table/space set-up, and more. On the day of our wedding, she directed vendors, guided guests, and dealt with unforeseen emergencies. Our wedding could not have gone smoother and it was in a large part because of Jackie!

We had a year-long planning timeline in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic and no matter how anxious I got, Jackie was always able to calm me down and for every problem that popped up in my mind, she had a solution. She made me laugh on our calls and when I was faced with a problem with one of my vendors, she was quick to validate my feelings, work through difficult conversations with the vendor and when it resulted in having to fire that vendor 3 weeks before the wedding, Jackie was already sending me suggestions for replacements. There was never a moment where I felt like she didn't have my back. And the day of the wedding...she and Cookie were so supportive! My mom had rave reviews and was so thankful to have their support on my wedding day. I highly recommend About Joy Events!

The day of our wedding Jackie and Cookie allowed us to completely relax because they took care of all the details. Jackie brought our bouquet and boutonnière to the hotel and oversaw all the transportation logistics of getting our family to and from multiple locations across San Francisco. Cookie ensured our vendors dropped off the cake and flowers to our dinner reception, made sure the table was set with place cards, candles were lit and music was playing. When we walked into our dinner reception it was exactly what we had hoped for. We would highly recommend Jackie and Cookie for your wedding day needs.

ares for you and your husband's needs. Jackie was an excellent hire! She's now become a good friend now that my wedding is over! Woohoo! Jackie, and her assistant Cookie, were a great help at our wedding in late October 2021. They set up my wedding exactly as I imagined, though I recommend that you as a bride organize and label everything clearly. Up until that date, Jackie had been consultive since the very beginning of the contract. She and I would have regular calls monthly then closer to the date, weekly. While Jackie isn't the most organized person, she acts with urgency and she genuinely cares about my needs. Jackie was basically a therapist, who not only gave advice on love and navigating planning with my husband, but she also gave great advice on whether vendors were a great deal, her opinions on the industry, and recommended excellent vendors including our DJ, florist, and more. My only regret is not paying a bit more to get an extra hour or so for her help with cleaning up our BYOAlcohol wedding! All of her recommendations were top-tier vendors – and that's extremely important when planning your wedding! You want your wedding planner to work well with other vendors, but you also want to trust that your planner knows good people who will show up on time and produce A+ work. Hire Jackie.

She was a huge lifesaver and our wedding wouldn't have been nearly as smooth and fun without her. For the day-of-coordination, not only did Jackie and Cookie make everything seamless and easy for my partner and I, but they also made everything in our wedding look absolutely stunning. They managed everything from setting up the flowers and coordinating with the caterers on timing to figuring out the layout for ceremony and handling the rearrangement of the backyard for the reception.

Thankfully, nothing went wrong and we had a great day. But knowing that we had the same outlook on the day was very reassuring.
