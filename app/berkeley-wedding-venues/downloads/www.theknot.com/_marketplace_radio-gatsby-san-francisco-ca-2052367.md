If I could give Radio Gatsby 10 stars I would! From the very first call with Noam, our experience was AMAZING! The band truly made the party. The dancefloor was filled the ENTIRE n...

ight with all generations dancing together to music from across the decades. The musicians are clearly a tight group of professionals. We were frustrated by the proliferation of marketing companies posing as bands and Radio Gatsby was the exact opposite! We started with a single keyboard for the ceremony and made a special, somewhat unconventional song request for the bride that Noam executed flawlessly. Then, a Radio Gatsby Trio played upbeat, fun music for the cocktail hour, setting the tone for an amazing reception. For the reception, Noam acted as MC, keeping the speeches, cake cutting (they play a special and wonderful selection for the cake cutting that we didn't request but absolutely loved!) and first dances on track. We invited all guests to join the first dance and from that moment on, the dance floor was full. Radio Gatsby has a very extensive song list across genres and played exactly what the bride and groom requested. They were a dream and such an important part of making the wedding a memorable, amazing night!

My husband and I got married last month and Radio Gatsby played at our wedding at the Mark Hopkins Hotel in San Francisco. To say we had an amazing experience with them would be a...

n understatement! At the wedding, their music was high energy, fun for all ages, and full of so (so!) much soul :) BUT, just as important to us was how easy and pleasant it was working with them before the wedding itself. We worked closely with Noam (the manager) for a month before our wedding and he took so much time with us to iron out all the details of the night. We appreciated so much that Noam was on board with us either being hands off in the music selection process or completely hands on (we were hands on!). Noam spent over 45 minutes with us on our first phone call and from then on out was SO communicative, professional, and kind. He responded to texts, emails, phone calls promptly and never thought our requests were too weird or extravagant. My partner and I handpicked every single song for the night (from their HUGE list of songs they play) and then when we requested a few more they were gracious enough to learn them! In addition to that incredible gesture, I was worried the music might be too loud for our event and Noam assured us that the volume of the music was completely up to us and that on the night of the wedding we could approach them about going louder or softer. That really meant a lot to us to have that kind of control. I really can't stress enough how thoughtful Noam was in helping us curate such a special night in our lives. It felt like working with the kindest friends (who are incredibly musically talented). In addition, on the night of our wedding the MC'ing got a little messed up and so we approached Noam about announcing our speakers giving toasts and Noam agreed on the spot! He took over the MC'ing of our wedding in the moment and saved our wedding from appearing unorganized. We really can't stress enough how fun the music was, how classy the communication beforehand was, or how many people told us they loved the band the next day! 10/10 we would recommend Radio Gatsby!

Radio Gatsby exceeded all my expectations for our wedding band. Noam was professional, responsive, and guided us through picking a great set of music for our ceremony, cocktail hou...

r, dinner, and dance party. While some bands we reached out to were either unresponsive or arranged everything through a non-member of the band, Noam is both the keyboardist and manager, giving you a much more direct connection to the music, and was a joy to work with. The band itself was absolutely fantastic! We had Yvette Pylant as the lead vocalist and she is a Broadway level talented singer. They started off the dance party with the classic "I wanna dance with somebody", and I swear it sounded better than the original recording. The horn hits and groove of the band gave so much energy to the dance party. You can tell that the band is made up of professionals. For the father daughter dance, Noam decided that we use the recorded version of "Count on me" to keep more of the original feel. However due to a technical difficulty, the song stopped in the middle of the dance. But without missing a beat, their bass player picked up the bass line and started singing, filling in where the recording dropped out! The rest of the band quickly picked up the song as well, and the audience ended up singing along too, making for a very special moment. Thank you to the whole band for an amazing evening!

Communicating and coordinating with Noam prior to the event was a breeze as well--he is very thorough and diligent! In terms of performance, the eight-piece ensemble was incredibly talented, and their energy was contagious. Our guests couldn't stop raving about the band--who could blame them??

Radio Gatsby played at my 70th birthday party. From the beginning, Noam was attentive and always receptive to our ideas. We were able to choose songs from their extensive set list...

and added a couple of requests. The mission for the party was to have excellent music which would get people dancing. The evening started with jazz for cocktails and dinner, a perfect combination of songs which allowed guests to get settled in. When the dance party started, the music built throughout the night to the point that everyone was on the dance floor. The music exceeded our expectations, and everyone said how great Radio Gatsby sounded. They allowed me to sit in with them on drums for two songs which was an honor and incredibly fun. I highly recommend Radio Gatsby for your special event. Bruce Simon.

From our intro call to ceremony to late night dance party, Noam coordinated the timing and flow of our entire day. He offered loads of advice and his expertise on throwing a smooth event/killer party was invaluable. He even came to the redwoods and played piano while we took pictures.

Radio Gatsby are professionals in every sense of the word. First things first, they are phenomenal musicians. So many of our guests can't stop telling us how great they were. Not ...

only did they sound fantastic, but they chose the right songs that kept people on the dance floor all night long -- and that's saying a lot given we are millenials and our guests ranged from children to 70-somethings! We are especially appreciative that, even though they have a huge, diverse repertoire, they learned, and went above and beyond in performing, our first dance song. It was magical. Second of all, not only are they professional in a musical sense, Noam, the bandleader/ point person, was so incredible to work with in the planning process. He always responded in a timely manner, made sure to get all the details he needed about our event (even giving us ideas and valuable advice along the way), and was just super, super nice. The ease of working with Noam took so much weight off our shoulders during a time that easily could have been stressful with a less experienced or communicative vendor. Every time we ended a call with him we felt excitement and peace of mind. Even more, we really felt like he "got" what we wanted, and the payoff at the actual wedding only confirmed that. In short, do yourself a favor and hire Radio Gatsby.

arrived. When the reception moved upstairs to a larger space, the full band and a singer performed. Everyone agreed the band exceeded expectations. On a personal note, I want to thank Noam for the special assistance he provided me. Unbeknownst to the bride and groom, I had rewritten the lyrics to a popular song as a tribute to the new couple. I asked Noam if the band's singer would lead the guests in singing the song while he provided keyboard support. We exchanged emails, phone calls, and even audio files for a week as we planned the surprise. Noam was able to convince me it would be more meaningful if I led the song myself, which I ended up doing, and it was a rousing success that I'll remember fondly all my life. Noam and Radio Gatsby provided me with both moral and musical support at the reception. I'm eternally grateful. If you're looking for music for your wedding, I wholeheartedly endorse Radio Gatsby for their musical ability, professionalism, and flexibility. Totally awesome!

Booking Radio Gatsby was one the best decision we made across our entire wedding. I can’t say enough good things about Noam and his crew of talented musicians . Our wedding was ...

complicated! Five performances each with unique sound needs, including a musical surprise from the bride, a musical surprise from the bride’s mom and the need to keep THOSE TWO secret from each other, a transition to DJ, external performers. You name it, we had it. Radio Gatsby handled it all. Noam made our lives easier at every turn. He was kind, thoughtful, extremely open and collaborative, communicative. A performer’s dream. The band was incredible - every musician talented, and just the right vibe for each unique moment. They were able to orchestrate a last minute first dance song for us that wasn’t in the repertoire. They can play seemingly anything, do it well, and with high energy and class. Can’t recommend enough!

adio Gatsby’s seven-piece band add an unexpected and fun flair to the evening, but they also set the mood for the entire event and created the most perfect vibe! I cannot thank Radio Gatsby enough for their advice, great communication, and time planning during our event. From the start of the cocktail hour, Radio Gatsby set the tone for the evening getting guests in the mood for an evening of fun and fundraising. As the evening progressed, Radio Gatsby seamlessly upped the tempo of their music and got guests in the spirit of bidding for our live auction. All the band members were professional and courteous, and even more so, appreciative of our collaboration. The band was very attentive to our needs and expertly cleared and re-set their equipment before and after our live auction, which also took place on our stage. At the conclusion of our live auction, Radio Gatsby instantly had every guest on their feet dancing the night away and singing along to popular hits with that special Radio Gatsby twist! As the co-chair of the evening, there was nothing more satisfying then hearing our guests chanting “encore encore!” at the conclusion of the band’s last set. Noam and Radio Gatsby were a pleasure to work with from our very first communication to our last. Without a doubt, I would not hesitate to hire Radio Gatsby for a future event. What an amazing evening the Gatsby Gala was! Thank you Radio Gatsby! I only wish that when I was married 13 years ago you had been around!

Radio Gatsby played our wedding for 120+ people at the Berkeley City Club, and exceeded our high expectations! The band brought awesome energy that had everyone - young and old - o...

n the dance floor the entire night. They did a great job reading the room, playing some soulful classics along with their own twists on more modern jams. Rhonda Sauce killed the vocals; amazing range. And impressive solos all around the band. The band is clearly experienced playing weddings, and it showed throughout the planning process and the performance itself. Noam worked with us on our entrance and first dance, did a great job listening to us on the vibe we were going for, provided input/insight where needed, and generally instilled confidence through the entire planning process (including covid rescheduling). Multiple of our wedding guests told us that they were the best band that they'd ever seen perform at a wedding. We couldn't be happier with our choice to book them!

Radio Gatsby as a jazz trio performed at our sonoma wedding and set an incredible ambiance to a flower filled, vineyard, starlight vibe. The double bass was especially a hit -- he...

had the smoothest voice and perfect for some Frank Sinatra! The band was classic, fun, and brought a special touch to our wedding -- my mom called me after the wedding to say that Radio Gatsby was one of her favorite touches! Noam organized everything, set up all the equipment, thought of all the logistical details like extension cords, and worked seamlessly with our planner. He's a total pro. So kind and wonderful for your special events -- highly recommend. They also DJ'd our dance party and brought the house down!!
