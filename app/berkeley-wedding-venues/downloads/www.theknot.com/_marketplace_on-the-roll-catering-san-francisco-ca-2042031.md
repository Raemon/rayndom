Leading up to our wedding, working with On the Roll Catering and Events was a great experience. Lena was incredibly responsive and helpful throughout the planning process. The tast...

ings were excellent, and we truly felt heard. They were open to our feedback and made adjustments based on our preferences. The cocktail hour was a highlight – the food was delicious and beautifully presented, and our guests were raving about it. However, the dinner service didn’t go quite as smoothly. We were running a bit behind schedule transitioning guests from cocktail hour to their seats, and the catering team served all the food before everyone was seated. As a result, our meals – and many of our guests’ – were cold by the time we ate. Additionally, wine and water weren’t placed on the tables before the food service began, despite having discussed our wine service preferences in detail during a planning meeting. My husband, my dad, and our venue coordinator all voiced their frustration during the event, and it took longer than expected for the situation to be addressed. Some of the groomsmen even took it upon themselves to grab bottles of wine and serve guests directly, which was helpful, but clearly not something they should have had to do. On top of that, far too many bottles of wine were opened unnecessarily, so we had to send open bottles home with their staff instead of saving them for another occasion. That said, our guests still commented that the food itself was good. We just wish the day-of coordination had matched the quality of the planning phase. With a bit more attention to timing and execution, this could have been a five-star experience.

njoyed it—and they definitely did! We had several special requests and last-minute add-ons that most vendors would probably decline, but Masha, Lena, and the entire team accommodated everything we asked for, making our wedding truly special. The drinks were delicious, the crew was fantastic, and they even helped us secure rentals just a week before the wedding—I’m still impressed they pulled it all off! Highly recommend!

nd tasty. We didn't need to lift a finger to support them and they went above and beyond to help us with any extra needs. Not to mention the constant stream of contact in the months leading up. They truly made our day SO easy and we would absolutely book them again in a heartbeat.

For our wedding, we wanted a caterer who met the trifecta: 1) delicious food with a distinctive taste, 2) affordable, and 3) easy to work with. With Masha Matveyeva from “On the Ro...

ll” catering, we hit the jackpot! We tasted a variety of caterers prior to the wedding (which you should do as well), but hands down, Masha’s food was the most unique, flavorful and highest quality. And what you taste in the samples is what you get at the wedding—amazing appetizers and delectable dishes that everyone at our wedding raved about. Working with Masha was a delight. From the first menu planning to wrapping up final details close to our wedding, we were seriously impressed with how consistently responsive, helpful and willing to go the extra mile she was. Masha always had our backs and was friendly and down-to-earth. Our other wedding vendors were good, but let’s just say they paled in comparison. Finally, a word about her staff on the day of: they were absolutely marvelous! Hardworking and professional, but also sweet and human. One of the memories we will cherish is the impromptu toast they gave us (with paper cups) after all the guests were gone. Masha and her crew are a special bunch. We recommend them to anyone looking for a caterer whose warmth, quality and professionalism can bring just a little extra flavor to your wedding or special event.

On the roll catering was referred to us by a mutual friend and we were relieved right after our first meeting. Masha and her team made us feel so comfortable and they took care of...

all our needs from delicious food to rentals and everything in between. Also I wanted to note that the venue didn’t have an excellent kitchen to say the least and we didn’t hear a word of complaint from any one of the team. I would highly recommend these wonderful catering crew. It’s very important when you don’t have to worry about a thing on your wedding day.

as delicious! Everyone was raving about the deviled eggs and chimichurri steak bites. The servers and bartenders were a joy to talk to yet very professional at the same time. It really felt like the entire catering team was a part of our huge family. Main courses were so not your typical wedding steak and fish !! They had stuffed Cornish hens and miso glazed cod and various healthy and truly inventive sides. The overall experience was at the 5 stars level and above !!! We are happy and proud to recommend Masha and her On The Roll Catering team. They will make your evening 100% effortless and absolutely enjoyable.
