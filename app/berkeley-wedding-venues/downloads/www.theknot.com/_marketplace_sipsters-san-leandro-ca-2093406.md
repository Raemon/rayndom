y worked closely with us to curate a custom drink menu that fit our theme and our guests' tastes. The bartenders arrived on time, set up efficiently, and were ready to serve drinks in no time and even offered help with other things non bartender related. The service was top notch throughout the entire event. They set up, they cleaned up and left it as though they were never there making party planning and clean up so much easier and less stressful. Sipsters exceeded all of our expectations and we thank you so much!
