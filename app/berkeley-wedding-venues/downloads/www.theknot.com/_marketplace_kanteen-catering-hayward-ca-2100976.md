### About this vendor

At Kanteen, we craft unique, personalized catering experiences that turn every occasion into a lasting memory. From large weddings and private celebrations to corporate events of any scale, our team brings thoughtful planning, beautiful presentation, and bold, soulful flavors to every table. From classic Indian cuisine to creative fusion and international flavors, they get to know your personal tastes to design a menu that is all "you". Proudly serving the San Francisco Bay Area, surrounding regions, and the entire West Coast, we’re dedicated to creating events that feel effortless, elevated, and unmistakably you. Born From a Passion for Food: Kanteen was founded by Chef Dinesh & Vishwas — two food lovers whose journey began in the most unexpected place: a badminton court. During the Covid years, Chef Dinesh created a unique 5-course Friday night menu for home delivery. Around the same time, I (Vishwas) was finishing his MBA at Wharton. The menu’s bold flavors and creativity struck a chord so deeply that I dropped my plan to move into finance and instead followed my passion. I left the corporate world to build Kanteen with Dinesh. We both shared a love for food: one with extraordinary culinary skill, the other with a clear vision and plan. Together, we created Kanteen. What began as a simple idea has grown into one of the Bay Area’s most trusted catering teams, delivering elevated, heartfelt experiences for weddings, corporate events, and private celebrations. Menus Made Just for You: Choose from live stations, vibrant buffets, or elegant plated dinners, showcasing the richness of regional Indian cuisines—Andhra, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala, and Gujarat—paired with globally inspired menus. Kanteen happily accommodates vegan, Jain, gluten-free, and other dietary needs. Reach out today to start creating a menu that you and your loved ones will never forget.

We chose Kanteen for our family event, and this was our third time working with them — they continue to be an outstanding partner. The team is consistently thoughtful, organized, a...

nd genuinely invested in getting every detail right. The food was a highlight once again, especially the Old Delhi Chicken and Tres Leches Ras Malai, both of which received rave reviews from our guests. A great experience all around.
