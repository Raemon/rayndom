Mei and her senior stylist, Nancy, did my hair and makeup for my wedding in Saratoga. She also did hair and makeup for my 3 bridesmaids, mother, and mother-in-law. We LOVED it. Mei...

and Nancy spent a lot of time with us making sure we were happy and they were both very kind and easy to work with. Could not recommend more.

Absolutely amazing! Mei was a pleasure to work with both for our ceremony and for our reception a few days later. I had two different dresses for the events with different styles...

. All I had to do was show Mei my outfits and the hair ornaments I was thinking of using, and she created stunning and different looks for each one. Mei also was ingenious in taking apart and rearranging a live flower and succulent hair comb I had brought. Her husband Robert was also super communicative and helpful in coordinating. Highly recommend!

Hire Triple Twist and Mei! Here's what you'll get if you hire Mei: 1\. Quick and detailed responses: Mei and her husband, Robert run the company together, with Robert handling the ...

business and scheduling side of things, resulting in email responses that took sometimes less than an hour to receive, while I had to wait a few days or weeks to hear from other companies. Given I am in another state and time zone, this helped me with my own scheduling and planning. 2\. A personalized hair and makeup trial: I highly suggest opting for the hair and makeup trial in Mei’s studio beforehand. Her studio is located in Union Square, which was a 5 minute walk away from my hotel, making it super convenient. Her studio is small yet open, airy, and beautiful. She has music playing, making the mood light and comfortable. I showed her pictures of the hairstyle and makeup I wanted and she asked me a few follow-up questions to better understand the colors and setting of my wedding. She immediately understood my vision and quickly replicated and exceeded my expectations. 3\. A prompt, speedy yet perfect wedding day: Mei and her additional team member, Anna, showed up early to our hotel on our wedding day to set up. And because I had a hair and makeup trial, my estimated 2-hour time slot only took 1.5 hours- but Mei’s work was flawless! Everyone in my wedding party absolutely loved their makeup and hairstyles. And Mei and Anna were so relaxed yet professional, and getting ready with them around was like having two additional friends to chat with. 4\. A natural, enhanced look: Mei specializes and emphasizes that her makeup style is natural, which is exactly what I wanted. Her philosophy is to enhance the natural beauty of all her brides, and as an artist, she really does achieve that. I’m usually apprehensive to get my makeup done because I sometimes don’t recognize the person staring back at me in the mirror. But Mei made me feel the most beautiful, inside and out. She was so lovely to chat with and get to know. I do not regret hiring Triple Twist- they made my wedding experience stress free and joyful and I can’t thank them enough!

ur hair and makeup turned out - it far exceeded expectations! Many of us don't typically wear a lot of makeup and Mei and her team did a great job at listening to what we wanted and helping us look natural, yet elevated on the wedding day!

Triple Twist did the makeup and hair for all the women in our wedding party at Saratoga Springs in August 2021. Robert managed all of the logistics, while Mei and her team did our ...

hair and makeup. In addition to being very easy to reach, Robert and Mei were also very responsive to my feedback after my hair and makeup trial (which was done with them in March 2021). They were also exceptional in making all of us feel safe and comfortable with their COVID-safe protocols, making sure to state their vaccination status, sanitize, wear masks, and keep areas well ventilated -- especially because there were members of our wedding party that were at higher risk for COVID and we do have to take our masks off in order to do makeup. :) Day of, Mei and her team were punctual and fun -- requesting some party music so we could have a more festive getting ready session. The team was also bilingual, which helped a lot because they could communicate with my mother in Chinese. They are all talented makeup and hair artists who were able to take my bridal party’s inspiration photos and turn them into reality. Everyone looked fantastic in photos. Most impressively, my makeup held up for the 12 hours that I was partying with a mask on. Mei provided a touch-up kit, but I ended up not using it and my makeup still looked fantastic in the photos. I did a low updo for my hair, which did start to fall out as I was dancing (but I was going pretty hard so this is not Mei’s fault and it still somehow looked like it was on purpose...). We all loved Triple Twist so much that one of my bridesmaids ended up booking them for her wedding. Highly recommend. :)

ause of a pandemic they were flexible and kind and able to accommodate my changes. As for Mei's artistry, when i walked into her studio and saw the costume makeup she had done on Robert, I knew I was in the right place. I was very clear, that I did not want to be the typical blushing bride and brought some ideas with me to my trial and Mei brought my dreams to life. The day of, my bridesmaids and mom had a ton of fun at her portable studio and were able to capture some great pictures of me getting ready. Thank you for bringing the drama, and making all of us feel even more beautiful.

eam made myself and the entire wedding party look beyond amazing! Mei even helped when my brother broke out in a last minute allergic reaction that left red dots all over his face near his mouth. After 8-10 minutes it was as if it never happened and stayed that way throughout the evening. Her artistry made all of us look flawless with a timeless beauty and elegance. She also nailed every hair style request from photos we had off websites. She even remained flexible when I had two attendants arrive late and miss their spot in the timeline and we were able to rotate people around to make everything work (I had 6 + myself). I would highly recommend Mei and Triple Twist for your wedding make-up and hair needs.

only for two more, as we wanted an early start on pictures before the ceremony. Even though it was a tight schedule, they did a great job with everyone's hair and makeup and stayed on schedule. I was SO SO happy with my hair and makeup. I didn't want the makeup to look heavy, yet I wanted it to look good in the pictures. I also don't usually wear a lot of makeup so I didn't want to look too made up. Mei listened to what I wanted and she did it perfectly! I LOVED my hair and makeup and all of the bridesmaids looked amazing!! Communication with Robert was easy and they were really flexible when it came to timing for my trial, as well of the wedding day schedule. I loved that after the trial they sent the pictures in both black and white and color from all different angles. It was definitely worth the extra cost to do the trial. Mei also understood what changes I wanted from the trial hair and executed them perfectly on the day of! Robert and Mei showed up promptly the morning of the wedding with their whole setup and once they were set up in our hotel suite, Mei and Marcela got to work. My hair and makeup lasted ALL day (basically from 10am till past midnight!) and didn't even have to be re-pinned/fixed up after taking some windy pictures at the Palace of Fine Arts and Baker Beach. Both my hair and makeup lasted through the hours of dancing later in the night! Mei, Robert and Marcela were nothing but professional, knowledgeable and amazing from start to finish! I would highly recommend Triple Twist!!!

ei's work! She did exactly what I was envisioning for my wedding day. Every concerned I had was acknowledged and when I would hesitate to answer a question if I liked something or not, Mei would reassure to be honest and that she is there to make me look how I want and for me to feel beautiful. Her studio was also beautiful and spotless. Her husband Robert was extremely prompt and wonderful with returning emails and phone calls. After Mei was done with my hair and makeup, Robert instantly turned her studio into a photo shoot space and took professional pictures from all angles so us brides can get an idea of how we will look in our wedding pictures. I received the pictures within a couple of hours of leaving the studio and I loved them! I would defiantly recommend Triple Twist for any occasion in which you are looking to get your hair and makeup done!
