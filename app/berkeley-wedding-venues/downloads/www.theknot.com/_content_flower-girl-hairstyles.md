  * What to Consider Before Choosing a Flower Girl Hairdo
  * 33 Adorable Flower Girl Hairstyles She'll Love



## What to Consider Before Choosing a Flower Girl Hairdo

Before diving into all of the flower girl hairstyle inspiration, there are some important factors to think through. Below, we've included all the details to take note of for your littlest bridal attendant. 

  * **The length, texture and growth-pattern of the hair:** Let your flower girl's [hair length and texture](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-hair-type-tips) be your style compass. For instance, if she has long straight hair, reinforce it with a bouncy ponytail, or if she has short natural curls, let them shine as they are and top off her 'do with a cute hair accessory.
  * **The person styling the hair:** Many styles are simple and can easily be DIY-ed by a loved one or friend. If complex styling is required, you may want to work with a [professional stylist ](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/beauty-services)who specializes in flower girl hair.
  * **Styling time:** it's important to remember that flower girls are typically between the ages of three and eight years old, so their desire to sit still can vary. Some styles take just a few minutes to pull off, while others require a bit more time and patience. Generally, the more complex the hairstyle, the longer it will take to execute. Take this into consideration if you're working with a particularly energetic mini.
  * **Wedding style:** Keep the wedding theme and style in mind when looking for hair inspiration. It can also be helpful to send style ideas to the couple in advance so they can give their thoughts on the flower girl hairstyle you're loving.
  * **Hair accessories and flowers:** Flower girl accessories like tiaras, bows and headbands are the easiest way to transform the simplest of styles into something elegant without the extra time or effort. If you're going the flower crown route, you should discuss that with your florist well in advance of your wedding day.



## 33 Adorable Flower Girl Hairstyles She'll Love

There are plenty of adorable ways to style the littlest member of the bridal party. From cute curls to pretty updos, we've rounded up some of the best flower girl hair inspiration that will help her shine on the big day.

FEATURED VIDEO FROM THE KNOT

### 1\. Half-Up Flower Girl Hairdo With Pastel Flower Crowns

![Half up flower girl hairstyle with flower crowns](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/9fc4fc3f-01d0-4232-b362-05fd1f65796e~rs_768.h-cr_0.699.1400.2099)

_[Photo: Ashleigh Coleman Photography](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=2866X1446373&isjs=1&jv=15.9.1&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theknot.com%2Freal-weddings%2Fflower-girls-in-pink-dresses-flower-crowns-and-fairy-wings-follow-the-bride-photo%3Fcontext%3Dwhimsical-flower-girl-dresses-photos&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ashleighcolemanweddings.com%2F&xs=1&xtz=300&xuuid=942387f598fe55b2357970e9581a29b8&xjsf=other_click__contextmenu%20%5B2%5D)_

If the flower girl attire leans more maximalist, consider keeping the hairstyling on the simpler side. A simple half-up hairstyle ensured these youngsters' flower girl hairdos didn't upstage their floral accessories. Both attendants donned floral angel wings with pink and blue blooms that perfectly complemented the ribbon-clad flower crowns that adorned their heads. 

### 2\. Flower Girl Updo With Garden-Inspired Flower Crown

![Flower crown flower girl hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/34df5166-70ba-4cdb-bea5-c874f2d1d47d~rs_768.h-cr_0.146.1400.1546)

This flower girl's curly locks were brushed back into a simple ponytail updo so that her springy flower crown could shine. The adorable attendant rocked a flower crown made of hellebores, daisies, lisianthus and hypericum berries. Since her blue-and-white [flower girl dress](https://www.theknot.com/content/flower-girl-dresses) had such a distinct pattern, keeping her hairstyle on the simple and elegant side ensured the look felt cohesive. 

### 3\. Simple Flower Girl Hairstyle for Short Hair 

![Simple clip flower girl hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/02bc664d-4a50-4b80-9757-7f716e214238~rs_768.h-cr_0.501.1400.1901)

_[Photo: UNIQUE LAPIN Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/unique-lapin-photography-new-york-ny-556303)_

How adorable is this little attendant? Just because a flower girl has short hair doesn't mean you can't still do something fun for their look. A simple pearl-encrusted clip adorned the girl's hair. If your flower girl has bangs, make sure to get them trimmed shortly before the wedding so they don't fall in the child's face during the wedding processional. 

### 4\. Flower Girl Hairstyle With Goldenrod Flower Crown 

![Goldenrod flower crown flower girl hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/676c83c1-6038-4c7d-8899-01a3b709bede~rs_768.h-cr_0.266.1068.1334)

_[Photo: Ledia Tashi Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/ledia-tashi-photography-riverview-fl-876959)_

Goldenrod, a vibrant yellow flower, was used throughout the ceremony decor at this wedding. To add cohesion to the event, goldenrod was also formed into a flower crown to sit atop this kiddo's curly short hair. While flower crowns are adorable in photos, keep in mind that young flower girls may be eager to take them off if they start to feel itchy or bothersome. Thankfully, this girl's curly hair was kept simple so that she would look just as cute sans-flower crown as she did with it. 

### 5\. Short Flower Girl Hairstyle With Pink Rose Flower Crown

![Short hair flower crown flower girl hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/b8d46657-ed17-4f45-a5d4-ae9bb66d7944~rs_768.h-cr_0.206.1400.1606)

_[Photo: Ilse Salinas Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/ilse-salinas-photography-mcallen-tx-2031933)_

What's not to love about a pop of color? This flower girl's dress had colorful flower embellishments so, naturally, vibrant flower hair accessories were the way to go. Instead of a traditional flower crown, this girl's accessory was a headband with flowers. Going this untraditional route had the added benefit of keeping her hair out of her eyes. And to bring the entire pink-centric look together? Rosy lip color.

### 6\. Children's Wedding Hairstyles With Bejeweled Accessories 

![Flower girlf hairstyle with bejeweled accessories ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/b025c104-3068-475d-bedb-64afa3ec33f3~rs_768.h-cr_0.201.1363.1564)

_[Photo: Elizabeth Fogarty](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/elizabeth-fogarty-germantown-md-768810)_

Guess what? There is no rule stating that your flower girl hairstyles have to match if you're having multiple attendants. Here, one kid's hairstyle was a fun updo while the other younger had loose curls. To bring cohesion to the duo's look they both sported bedazzled headbands as a finishing touch.

### 7\. Half Braid in Child's Hair for Wedding

![Half braid flower girl hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/2f8ade76-29e5-4d18-b7a0-478bd9ae5e34~rs_768.h-cr_0.373.1400.1773)

_[Photo: UNIQUE LAPIN Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/unique-lapin-photography-new-york-ny-556303)_

Wondering what makes a good children's wedding hairstyle? Something that is as practical and durable as it is cute. Here, for example, some of the flower girl's hair was braided to help keep it out of her eyes. A style like this is nice because it'll stay put all evening long, whereas a style that involves clips and accessories could fall out (or the kiddo may be prone to play with it). 

### 8\. Various Easy Little Girl Hairstyles

![Various easy flower girl hairstyles](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/ffd4354a-7ebf-48e7-873f-233a75df2401~rs_768.h-cr_0.450.1400.1850)

_[Photo: Nirav Patel Photography](https://niravpatelphotography.com/home/)_

Just like each of your bridesmaids may want to lean into personalization with their hairstyle, the same goes for flower girls. Even if you have multiple young attendants, it's ok to plan on a different hairstyle for each one. One of the flower girls at this wedding had a half-up style while another sported a bow to pin back some of her locks. Lastly, the third youngster simply wore a natural look for her short curls. 

### 9\. Elegant Chignon Kid Hairstyle for Wedding

![Elegant chignon flower girl hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/c5dae041-7aaa-4e67-8126-a8bf23318979~rs_768.h-cr_0.170.1575.1745)

_[Photo: Melissa Stimpson Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/melissa-stimpson-photography-wilbraham-ri-380078)_

For a more-formal wedding, like a black-tie affair, hairstyles for flowergirls should match the mood. A simple bun is a nice option, as evidenced by this adorable flower girl who rocked a sleek chignon for her wedding party duties. 

### 10\. Flower Girl Hair With Large Bow Accessory 

![Flower girl with large bow accessory](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/fdc8aea3-f903-4cf3-845e-ae389ac0c745~rs_768.h-cr_0.73.1400.1473)

_[Photo: Lynette Boyle Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/lynette-boyle-photography-daly-city-ca-764039)_

What do you do when a young flower girl doesn't have much hair to style? One option is to lean more heavily into [wedding hair accessories](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-hair-accessories). At this wedding, they decked out the youngster with an adorable large bow to bring her look together. 

### 11\. Flower Girl at Korean Wedding With Traditional Hair Accessory

![Flower girl at Korean wedding with traditional hair accessory](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/92c6a2bc-6ed3-4570-b675-41b4c25835e1~rs_768.h-cr_0.391.1400.1791)

_[Photo: Emma Lili Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/emma-lili-photography-charleston-sc-1087837)_

The flower girl at this Korean wedding sported a small hanbok and finished off the look with a traditional hair accessory to complement the Korean attire. If you're wondering whether the flower girl outfit should lean into tradition, consider what the rest of the wedding party will be wearing. If the bridesmaids will also be in traditional garb, consider a [flower girl outfit](https://www.theknot.com/content/flower-girls-attire) that'll match.

_[Photo: Sposto Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/sposto-photography-signal-hill-ca-620447)_

Given that a flowergirl's role is all about flowers, how fun would it be to include a flower crown as part of their wedding hair? The attendants at this wedding had their long hair curled into lovely ringlets and then topped with fresh white crowns of baby's breath. 

### 13\. Half-Up Kid Hairstyle for Wedding With Fresh Flowers

![Half up flower girl hairstyle with fresh flowers](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/4a1c3c48-9e5e-427a-bfca-dd28b921e099~rs_768.h-cr_0.572.1400.1972)

_[Photo: Maura Jane Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/maura-jane-photography-santa-fe-new-mexico-nm-766906)_

Flower crowns are the only way to elevate children's wedding hairstyles. A burst of fresh blooms acted much like a bow often would atop the hair tie in their half-up styles. This is an especially lovely look for a spring garden wedding. 

### 14\. Elegant Bun Flower Girl Hairstyle

![Elegant bun flower girl hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/7e9a8599-e6e4-448a-9da2-4998ff559746~rs_768.h-cr_0.565.1600.2165)

An updo is a great way to show off a unique [flower girl dress color](https://www.theknot.com/content/what-color-flower-girl-wears). At this wedding, the attendant's blush dress took center stage and her sleek bun ensured that her hairstyle didn't detract from the beautiful look.

A tropical wedding calls for a hairstyle that fits the locale. This flower girl's hair was pulled back into a simple ponytail. To finish it off? She sported a crown of white blooms and fresh green leaves that looked absolutely stunning. 

### 16\. Simple Ponytail Flower Girl Hairstyle With Blue Bow

![Flower girl ponytail hairstyle with blue bow](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/3fe030bf-5ce8-4a6c-8caa-0a54991c4a2d~rs_768.h-cr_0.255.1400.1655)

_[Photo: Madeleine Collins Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/madeleine-collins-photography-laguna-beach-ca-1091021)_

Is your chosen flower girl a rambunctious bundle of energy? Rather than fighting against their proclivity for running around, lean into it by elevating a simple ponytail with an adorable bow accessory. 

### 17\. Intricate Flower Girl Hairstyle With Top-Knot

![Top knot flower girl hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/07bc0292-27ec-4949-8f4e-5c0b9389747d~rs_768.h-cr_0.30.1400.1430)

On the hunt for a great style for textured hair? This adorable flower girl got a hairstyle that sectioned her locks out, similar in style to box braids, before it was all tied together in a high bun. A pearl-encrusted bow finished off the style. 

### 18\. Curly Updo Idea With Crystal Headband

Do you remember making daisy chains during recess during elementary school? That's what these minimalist flower crowns remind me of. Even though each of these five flower girls sported a slightly different hairstyle, there was consistency across the kids' looks with their flower crowns. 

### 30\. Half-Up Flower Girl Hairstyle With Two Braids

How fun is this unique take on a half-up flower girl hairstyle. The top portions of each girl's hair was sectioned into two parts and then French braided. The result balances durability, elegance and creativity in an effortless way. 

### 31\. Flower Girl Hairstyle With High Ponytail and Flower Crown

While many junior attendants rock flower crowns while wearing their hair down, this flower girl sported a high pony to go with her ring of blooms. 

### 32\. Whimsical Flower Girl Hairstyle With Bow and Blooms

Having a hard time choosing between a flower girl hairstyle with a bow and one with fresh blooms? Why not just have both? This flower girl did and she looked absolutely adorable walking down the aisle. 

### 33\. Simple White Bow Flower Girl Hairstyle

Less is more with this adorable junior attendant's pulled-back hairstyle secured in place with a white bow.
