DJ. When planning our wedding, great music was one of the most important things and we specifically wanted someone who spun vinyl, James absolutely delivered. He created an incredible atmosphere during dinner and then transitioned into a full-on dance party. The dance floor was packed from the first song to the last, and we had multiple guests tell us they loved the music. James was easy to work with, understood our 'must-plays,' and made the night unforgettable, we are so happy we picked him!

beginning of our cocktail hour to the last song, Benji threw down... all while staying within the parameters of the music that we like and providing a ton of variety along the way. He even spent some time chatting with some of our drunk friends that just wanted to nerd out about music and vinyl; truly a great emcee and entertainer. He did a great job of reading the room and keeping the energy high -- exactly what we wanted. Working with Benji and Jamie leading up to the wedding was both enjoyable and easy. They didn't put too much pressure on us to curate a perfect playlist or anything like that. They made it clear from the beginning that you can really give them as much direction as you want. Trust them; they are true professionals who know what they're doing. I would recommend them to anyone planning a wedding where the music is truly a point of emphasis.

low, curated playlists with us, and best of all - spun vinyl. He played everything on our must-have list, but was able to feed into the sound and genres from that list to expand further, making it non-stop incredible. We wanted so many different types of music (literally nothing mainstream or basic), and he made it flow so easily. Our friends still talk about how he was the best music dj at any wedding hands down. We cannot recommend him enough.

At our first meeting, Jamie and Benji came prepared with what was clearly comprehensive, hard-earned knowledge about all of the complexities of coordinating weddings, along with in-depth knowledge of soul music. They were ready to plan for every contingency, and happy to talk us through even things we hadn't thought of before. On our wedding day, Benji ran through an incredible set of music that was exactly what we were looking for. All of our guests were thrilled with the music selection, and the experience that they had. If I had another event, I would be overjoyed to work with this crew again.

Do yourself a favor and hire Ceremony DJs. They’re the real deal. Benji was our DJ, and he is a master of his craft. Without hesitation, I will go to them first for any future e...

vent. Things start moving the moment you hire them. In the months leading up to the event, we had several very productive meetings with Jamie and Benji. Not only do they help you pick your music, but from their years of experience, they give tons of advice on planning and scheduling the actual wedding. In fact, our general outline for the events of the actual wedding came from their suggestions! This is super important since every phase of the wedding is accompanied by music to some degree, and they are very deliberate about how they pair the music with each phase. The actual process of picking music is super fun. Jamie and Benji are SUPER passionate about music of all genres. They met with us several times to gauge our taste both at a high level and for specific artists and songs. They also asked about our family and friends’ tastes, and how we wanted to incorporate that. Ultimately, we provided multiple lists of songs to fit each phase of the wedding (cocktail hour, ceremony, dancing, etc…) and asked Benji to fill in additional songs that fit the vibe. All in all, it was a seamless and super fun process. Their professionalism, planning, and organization was top tier the day of the wedding. Everything went SO smoothly. We were worrying about 100 different things, but Benji was not one of them. All he needed was a table and he took care of the rest (setting up multiple speakers, lights, soundcheck, etc…). He’s clearly done this countless times. He came hours before the guests arrived, and for teardown, he stayed hours after they left, both of which were seamless. Now let’s talk about Benji as a DJ. He’s a master who’s been DJing at a high level for decades. I can’t think of a single thing I would change about his set (which technically lasted 6 hours, from start until the end of the dancing). He really set the vibe of our wedding, catering to our specific taste while enhancing the beautiful setting of our backyard wedding. Even the small things were perfect, such as the music/microphone volumes, transitions of music to and from the speeches, etc… I would love to have Benji as a DJ for any future event.

They put in serious effort to make it all feel personal. Our friends and family kept complimenting the DJ being top-notch, A+ all the way, and we're still hearing about it weeks later. Benji's energy and smooth mixes had the dance floor packed non-stop. If you're looking for a DJ who's truly talented and super dedicated, go with Ceremony DJs.

to set expectations, share the unique elements that set apart Ceremony DJs (like that they compensate their DJs fairly and competitively), and describe their SUPER impressive list of artists on both digital and vinyl. Then after learning about our musical tastes, he identified a perfect DJ - Benji - to help us out that day. We got so many compliments from our guests about the music and so much of that credit goes to Benji who expertly crafted set lists that drew from our favorite artists.

er's Power, Corruption & Lies album art in their profile. Our initial call with Jamie was fun and exciting. We immediately started to discuss ideas and visions for how we wanted the wedding to sound. It felt like I was nerding out with a friend and just talking about music and events in general which was different from other vendors we had calls with. Our wedding was in Los Angeles in May 2024 so Jamie connected us with their local DJ, Aaron Castle. I really enjoyed all our creative discussions with Jamie and Aaron throughout the process. We handed off several large playlists for different parts of the night and covered various genres as inspiration for Aaron to work with. On the day of the wedding, Aaron and his assistant handled all the logistics as we transitioned from one space to another (ceremony, cocktail hour, reception). Their speaker setup sounded good. We also had one of our guests performing live during our cocktail hour. The Ceremony Team handled all the logistics for our musician friend and she was able to deliver a beautiful performance. Aaron curated a pretty eclectic and fun playlist for the night and he DJed it live starting from the reception all the way to the last song. We kept getting great feedback on the music selection throughout the night and afterwards. Yes, we noticed minor issues here and there but those didn't take away from how well the music was executed on our wedding day. The night flew by pretty fast and my wife & I both wished that we had an extra hour of dancing at our venue, instead of an after party at the next location. Overall, I would highly recommend working with Ceremony DJs if you care about music in general and looking to curate a unique sound for your wedding.

nd their New Order-inspired logo, I had high hopes. And Jamie more than delivered. The vibes were… the best. Exactly what we wanted. We had a wide range of requests: 60s girl groups, Japanese psychedelic rock, Taylor Swift, Indian dance music, the 80s pop that inspired the original outreach, and everything in between. Jamie wove everything together seamlessly and had the dance floor moving all night (even with a wide range of guests—many ages from all around the world). Besides the music selection, he’s super personable, professional, reliable… all the stuff you want in a DJ! Can’t recommend Jamie and Ceremony enough. A few of my friends asked for his card at our wedding, so hopefully we get to see him again soon!

Ceremony DJs did an incredible job with our recent wedding! We worked with Jamie, and enjoyed the entire process. We had multiple calls ahead of the wedding with him where he asked...

a bunch of questions to learn about our taste, our vision, and our family and friend’s tastes. He drove down from SF to the South Bay for a site visit to make sure there were no venue surprises and everything looked good. He was clearly invested in making sure that not only we but also all of our guests had a great time and that everyone hit the dance floor. As an indie music lover, I loved that I could trust Jamie to make my eclectic request list work! He played everything from Cocteau Twins to The Chicks to Donna Summer to MUNA to Talking Heads, and made it all work. I really felt like the wedding music from pre-ceremony to the end of the night reflected my taste and both of us received compliments from guests and family. Jamie nailed MC duties and killed it on the decks too. It was a treat to get an all-vinyl dance set and guests were super impressed! I would absolutely recommend Ceremony DJs to any couple looking for wedding music with a personality that really feels like them - and if you don’t know, trust Jamie to help you figure it out.

that went into getting to know our and our guests music tastes in order to create a perfect soundtrack for our day. Not only were we thrilled with the music throughout the evening, but our guests were showering us with compliments for the experience! Watching Jamie witch out vinyl covers as he moved through the set was a blast and had all our music lovers glued to the stage. Thank you for helping create a truly fun and magical day!!

I will say without shame that my husband and I are a little snobby about music. Early in the planning process when we discussed what we wanted to hear at our wedding we agreed tha...

t we didn't want a "wedding DJ" at all...we wanted a good DJ who would just happen to be playing at our wedding. (No offense to Earth, Wind, & Fire, but if we never heard "September" ever again, it would suit us just fine.) With this as our North Star, we started looking and were mostly disappointed in the selection, until we found Ceremony DJs. I admit that I first reached out to Ceremony because I noticed they used a New Order album cover as their cover photo, and I assumed from this that they'd be cool. Well, I was right. From the moment my husband and I first spoke with Jamie Guzzi, we knew we were being understood and that our music was in good hands. Although his company is based in San Francisco, Jamie has connections in cities all up and down the West Coast and are expanding Eastward. Jamie hooked us up with an LA-local DJ, Aaron Castle, and we had an hours-long conversation about the music that shaped us, the artists we love the most, and what we definitely, not under any circumstances, did not want to hear. It was like having drinks with new friends and by the end, we were convinced we'd made exactly the right choice. On the day of the event, Aaron ran sound at the ceremony, set the vibe at the cocktail hour, and kept the dance floor packed at the reception. All night people were coming up to my husband and I to rave about the musical selections. My husband and I could not be happier with this vendor and we would recommend them to anyone. If you care about music, hire Ceremony DJs.

From our very first phone call with owner James to midnight on our wedding night with DJ Aaron we couldn't have been happier or more fulfilled than with Ceremony DJs. They managed ...

to strike an almost impossible balance catering to our particular music tastes while ensuring over 150 guests danced all night. They were professional and personable, and each step of the way we felt completely cared for and attended to. We had very specific music cues during our ceremony and Aaron nailed every one. And they’re affordable! I'm lucky and honored that they were a vital part of my wedding and would enthusiastically recommend them for yours. Also, our wedding was in LA, so if you're not in San Francisco don't let that stop you from reaching out to them.

We hired Ceremony DJ's for our wedding and they did an excellent job. We had an initial meeting w/ Benji (our DJ) and Jamie (the founder) to discuss what musical vibe we are going ...

for. Their knowledge of music is extensive, these guys know their stuff. You will get something different than the typical "Wedding songs", and they don't just click play on a playlist and walk away - they were actively DJing the whole night. Their catalogue is extensive (90+ page document!). We got a ton of compliments on the music from our guests. We opted for the disco ball upgrade (it is giant!) and the upgraded sound package (definitely worth it). Jamie has done a ton of weddings, so he had good advice regarding the general flow of the day, what key songs to pick, and other useful tips. Music is really important to us, and Ceremony DJ's nailed the vibe of the day. Our wedding was a ton of fun, and we would hire them again in a heartbeat.

ur wedding. Working with them was definitely, by far, the most fun part of the wedding planning activities! James and Benji really exceeded my expectations! I knew they were going to be good, but what they ended up delivering was pure magic. They worked really hard into assembling a perfect playlist for our wedding, and they really put a lot of thoughts into it, and they definitely cared about us. Their passion of music really shined during the months leading up to our wedding and on the day of. I was so impressed by their extensive knowledge of music through so many genres and decades. Having a DJ who could spin actual vinyls was a must for me, and I liked that they could also pull up digital files seamlessly if needed. They definitely helped a lot in making our wedding day the best of our lives so far. We met over video a couple times before the wedding to discuss our musical preferences, where they asked us about bands and artists' names we liked. They 100% listened to our suggestions, and I never felt judged, and they were able to mix both our diverging musical preferences together on the day of. We also gave them a Spotify list containing about 200 songs in total to help preparing the final playlist. I think they must have played all the songs we requested on the day of, and Benji who was spinning vinyls for us that day and evening (4:45pm to 11:15pm) even found a way to play some more really good songs that were not in our initial playlist! The after-dinner party was so epic and everyone had a blast on the dance floor! I think the best part is that Benji even accepted to play some of my vinyls that I had brought to the Palace, and when he slapped on Your Hand in Mine by Explosions in the Sky as we were sitting down for dinner, I almost cried of happiness, it felt like a dream. One of my sisters and my mom actually said those words exactly, that the wedding day and evening felt like a movie, just like a dream. My only regret is that our wedding was at the Palace in SF, and they forced us to leave at around 11:15pm, and I feel like we were just getting started, it felt so good I could have kept dancing until the early morning. I will be recommending James and Benji at Ceremony DJs very strongly to friends and family.

If you have a niche musical taste and the music is of the highest importance for your reception, I highly recommend booking Ceremony DJs. We were very particular about what we did ...

and did not want to play at our wedding, and James absolutely knocked it out of the park for us. He spent time with us going over our individual music tastes as well as the music tastes of our loved ones for a beautifully curated experience. On the night of the wedding, their DJ booth was set up in a way that perfectly complemented our venue, and that extra touch added the perfect amount to the overall vibe of the party. I really appreciated the care and thought that they put into our playlists for the evening and how everything just fit together so well with our venue (as well as our personal style/taste). No offense if you like top 40 music, but we can’t stand it and we loved that ALL of the music played was only music that felt like “us”, nothing generic, or soulless. Basically, if you’re punk or goth or emo, or maybe just have a really diverse taste in music, you will be in perfect hands with Ceremony DJs. A true musical gem, this is a DJ company that I will continue to recommend to all the cool people in my life for years to come.

to have anyone with a good sense of music come tell you that they're experiencing the "coolest wedding ever!!". No joke. If Mick Jagger was hanging around for the vibes I wouldn't have been surprised. Working with Ceremony DJs is like flipping through your good friend's record collection and saying "Oh yeah!! This has a great track on it..let's play this for sure!". I'm pretty sure the crew at Ceremony DJs could simply write for Rolling Stone or NME and make a fine living off their extensive knowledge of music and it's interplay with culture but no.. us folks planning weddings are blessed with their insight and taste being channeled for the purpose of throwing what you'll know is the coolest wedding you've ever been to.

Care about music? Want to work with some personable professionals who love what they do? Contact Ceremony DJs and enjoy the ride! Working with them was easily some of the best part...

s of planning our wedding. From the start, my husband and I agreed that music and atmosphere were really important to us. We knew our crowd wasn’t likely the dancing type but we still wanted a top notch DJ for the night. Jamie and Aaron were a perfect fit for us. If you want, they will nerd out with you and go over all your musical interests (not just for the party!) Or, you give them enough info and you can trust that they will take it from there. The “homework” we got from them - putting together a playlist of our favorite tunes - was honestly some of the best bonding time for us as a couple in the weeks leading up to the party. Aaron was our DJ for the night and filled the Fairmont Penthouse with the best soundtrack. He handled some initial tech issues without batting an eye, and his set sounded great on the equipment he brought. The night flew by and I wish we had more time to hear Aaron’s stuff. From our initial call (super responsive) to contracting (straightforward agreement with very fair pricing) to the prep (a few fun calls in the weeks leading up to our event) to the actual night of, Ceremony DJ were great. They have worked with so many different couples and events, I’m certain that they have the music you want and can create an awesome soundtrack for whatever you want for your party.

I had a Napa wedding of 182 people that I was mostly planning by myself so you can imagine the stress. And yet any call we had with Jamie, immediately put me at ease. I kid you not he was the ONLY part of the wedding I didn't have to worry about. He also has experience coordinating weddings and it really helped to have someone who could anticipate the other aspects of a ceremony and reception. My whole family and all our friends were WOWED (which is not an easy thing to accomplish considering there were so many types of personalities and backgrounds). Jamie felt the energy of the room and just ran with it from cocktail hour through the reception. And the rate was more than reasonable. He even threw in some equipment no charge!! I'm bummed I'm based in LA because I would hire his company to play any event I have. I HIGHLY recommend anyone searching for a DJ to hire Ceremony DJ's. You will not regret it. Guests are still raving about the music.

It was so fun discussing music with him too during the planning meeting—his knowledge of music is vast and from the get-go we knew we were going with a DJ who not only knew his stuff but also totally understood our music taste. He blended indie rock/folk and ’70s rock perfectly for the cocktail hour and dinner, and for dancing he stuck to a fun ’80s / new wave set list. He used vinyl throughout the night and threw in some fun surprises (we loved the Julee Cruise during dinner). He also put his own spin on some guest requests, like playing a double length version of Billy Idol’s “White Wedding” with an extended instrumental breakdown. We also appreciated that even when the dance floor wasn’t bustling, he still kept the energy up. Thank you so much, Jamie!

He did a great job making our wedding music suit us and also reading the room and playing music from all eras that everybody could dance to. If you love music you can't find a better DJ. Jamie was friendly and professional throughout the planning process and our wedding night. His MCing of the wedding was exactly what we wanted to—the announcements for dinner, our entrance, and toasts were casual and not cheesy. When the dancing started there wasn't a moment when the floor wasn't filled. So many people came up to us that night to say that they loved the DJ.

our vendors, we had a two hour long Zoom meeting during which we hung out, drank beers, and chatted about all our musical interests and influences. We clicked with him immediately during this initial meeting and opted not to look at other DJ options even though he was more expensive than we originally budgeted for. That was okay with us though because we wanted to prioritize making our wedding a party and we could envision that happening with Jamie behind the decks. During the planning process, Jamie asked about everything: each of our musical preferences throughout the years (high school to college to the present day), what our friends listen to, and what our families listen to. Then we made a collaborative Spotify playlist that he used to create his wedding day set, but we also gave him some creative control since he obviously knows what he's doing. He stayed very available throughout the planning process via text and phone call, which made it easy to work with him. On the actual wedding day, the DJing was absolutely perfect and so much fun. He did a great job controlling the energy of the event, from the guests arriving, to cocktail hour, to the actual reception. Our playlist and preferred music leans towards electronic in terms of genre, particularly house for this event, but he also mixed in tons of fun hip hop and old indie favorites in a way that flowed really nicely. Since the event, multiple guests have told us that that they had fun specifically because the music and DJing were so good, so thank you Jamie for helping to make our wedding a success!
