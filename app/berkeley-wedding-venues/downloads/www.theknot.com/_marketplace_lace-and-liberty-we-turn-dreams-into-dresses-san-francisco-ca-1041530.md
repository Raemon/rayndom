I can’t say enough about how easy and amazing it was to work with Lace & Liberty to bring my wedding gown vision to life! I’m from Michigan, and even with Ali being all the way in ...

California, she was able to take everything I imagined and turn it into my dream dress. My fairytale gown became a reality because of her! I’m sharing my experience everywhere I can because I want other brides to know—if you’re looking for something unique and not off-the-rack, give Lace & Liberty a call. It’s so worth it!

I worked with Lace & Liberty to make my dress for my 10/12/24 wedding. The process was simple, but not seamless. Ali listened to what I wanted and the sketch she sent back was ever...

ything I wanted my dress to be. We picked out fabrics and that was that. The issue came eight months later when I got the first progress pictures. I’m a Black bride, and I mentioned during the consultation that I wanted the illusion back to match my skin tone. The pictures showed a dress with an illusion back clearly intended for a white woman. The fabric was also really pink. The swatches I received to pick from were champagne and blush, and though I chose the blush, what appeared in the photos was a LOT pinker than I thought it would be. I work in a field where I give notes on projects like this all the time, and I know that big notes need to be brought up ASAP to avoid lost work, so I mentioned both issues. To their credit, they jumped right on fixing the illusion issue and sent out swatches of the lace so that I could pick one closer to my skin tone. But when it came to the fabric, the response was: “It only looks that way because we have it under intense lighting.” In retrospect, I think they just didn’t want to redo the work, but if they’d offered the opportunity to replace the fabric, even if it was at a fee, I’d have taken them up on it. Instead, they minimized my concerns. I should have stopped them there, but I know that things photograph differently, and because I wasn’t in the same state to see it in person, I took their word for it. The next progress picture I got, the dress was complete and ready to be shipped, and it was very pink. Again, I voiced my concern, but the dress was already made. They offered a discount on a new one, which I recognize they didn’t have to do, but I was only able to afford the dress in the first place because of the promotion they were running when I originally booked, so I declined. The dress arrived and was stunning, but very pink. To add insult to injury, when I removed it from the bag, I could hear the beading falling off and hitting the floor. It turns out, most of the beads on my 3d floral lace were not secured and are very loose/dangly. The arm holes were too small, causing the lace to dig into my back and underarm. The zipper caught at the pocket, and when I brought this to L&L’s attention, I was told a seamstress would just have to remove the pocket that I’d paid them to put in. I was excited for months to finally get my dress, and I could not have been more disappointed. The dress is beautiful, and now that I’ve seen a seamstress, it fits in the underarms and zips without the removal of the pocket, but if I had to do it all over again, I’d have just bought one off of the rack. I avoided doing that because I wanted the vision I had in my head, but I still don’t have it, and I have probably spent more for the privilege.

ses I had tried on and explained which part of each I liked. Alison had a drawing ready to go at my first appointment, we made just a few tweaks, and that was it – super easy! In fact, it was so easy, I’d spent less than an hour between phone calls and the appointment, that I was a touch nervous. But there was no reason for concern! Lace & Liberty sent me the progress pictures, I asked questions, and was assured that they were executing my vision. Then the dress was ready by the end of October and it was marvelous!

oking at in the bridal shops. They are located in San Francisco, and I am in New Mexico. They were quick to respond to all my emails and phone calls. And even though I had all my consultations and measurements done via zoom, it fit like a glove. They sourced all the fabrics for me, considered my must have details, and listened to all my needs. I could not be happier. I am short plus size bride who got the wedding dress of her dreams because of the dedication of the Lace & Liberty team. Run, don't walk to them!!!

gn and it was a very smooth and stress-free process. The dress was PERFECT! I did a custom gown, mixing a satin top with a tulle skirt. I also changed the design of the top. It was so me and I am certain I couldn't have created a more perfect dress elsewhere. When I brought the dress to a tailor, she was shocked by how well it fit based on the measurements I sent. She also commented on the high quality of the materials. A huge thank you to L&L for being a bright spot during an otherwise difficult time to plan a wedding. They have my highest recommendation!

If you are interested in creating a custom wedding dress, I would NOT recommend Lace & Liberty. During my initial consult, everything went well. I shared with them in great detail ...

what I was looking for in my wedding dress and was told how excited the were to design my gown. Their designer Ali chose several laces, which were beautiful. After multiple emails about finalizing the design, I was suddenly told that they were unable to use the lace that their own designer selected for me. There were no alternative options provided just an email saying that they were unable to go forward with it and to go elsewhere. It was a waste of time and really hurtful. I ended up going with Anomalie and the entire experience has been wonderful! From the get go, Anomalie was much more organized, knowledgeable, kind, and the construction of their dresses looked better in my opinion. I'm looking forward to seeing my wedding dress.

I came to L&L after trying on sooo many dresses at other salons. I must have tried on all the dresses available by then. I was a mess and fed up with the whole thing. I'm surprised...

L&L even let me in the door, I was such a mess. L&L handled my craziness perfectly from start to finish. They helped me get the exact look I was going for, did everything they could to accommodate my timeline and delivered an impeccable dress (within my budget, no less!). Thank you to both Ali and Danielle for being so accommodating, helpful, and thoughtful throughout the whole process. You turned my nightmare into a dream come true. We've had to postpone our wedding but I cannot WAIT to show off my incredible dress. Thanks so much to the entire L&L team. You guys are one of a kind.

Lace & Liberty is the most amazing place! From the moment I stepped into their San Francisco showroom, I felt comfortable and welcomed. I had previously tried on some dresses at Da...

vid's Bridal and knew I wanted a lavender dress/skirt of some kind but was having a hard time finding something I liked. Enter Annie and Lace & Liberty! Annie is the absolute best and I love her. She helped me narrow down what I wanted and suggested great combos of their tops and skirts. She gave me enough space to express my thoughts/likes/dislikes while also providing excellent guidance and insight. I ended up choosing a beautiful lace top and a sparkly skirt that Annie was easily able to customize and make purple for me. PLUS IT HAS POCKETS. They were so easy to work with and provided timely updates and honestly I want to do my wedding over again just to buy more dresses from them. My dress is exactly what I wanted - it's beautiful and fun and sparkly and pretty and SO comfortable. Plus, I got a custom dress (that didn't even need alterations!) that was the color I wanted for less than $2000. I can't recommend them enough! Finding my dress was the part of wedding planning I dreaded the most and Lace & Liberty made it one of my favorite experiences.

Love love love my dress. I wish I could post photos on this review... The girls at Lace & Liberty were friendly, helpful, & an absolute pleasure to work with! They made my dress as...

a skirt & a top. I fell in love with the skirt right away. I found a top that I liked, but asked them to add boning to it. The end result was gorgeous & sooo comfortable. I had every expectation that I would change into sweat pants right when the dancing started. On the contrary, this dress was so comfy & I loved it so much, I didn't want to take it off at the end of the night!! Thank you Lace & Liberty for creating the perfect dress for me!!

Lace & Liberty in an incredible hidden gem. I had spent weeks going to traditional bridal salons with no luck, and was starting to get really discouraged. I felt like the dresses t...

hat were popular and trendy just weren’t me; nothing felt right or looked good. I would like the top of one dress and the bottom of another, or the lace on one skirt and the sleeves on another top, but no single dress had come close (or if it did, it was thousands of dollars over my budget). When I found Lace & Liberty and learned that I could choose the top, bottom, lace, and sleeves I wanted to form something totally custom, sized for me, and in my price range, it was a game changer. Now I don’t know why anyone would settle for anything else! The whole experience was lovely and relaxed, from my first visit at the small and adorable design studio to emailing measurements and pictures back and forth to finally picking up my dress. They were willing to work within my budget (which by current standards was small, around $1,000) and designed something truly gorgeous, comfortable, and personal. It also felt great to work with a small creative business after seeing so many marked up, cookie-cutter dresses at generic shops. I would recommend Lace & Liberty to absolutely anyone and plan to bring all my engaged girlfriends here!

A funny story - I'm originally from NY, but live in SF. I was looking on Pinterest for a dress with a shorter skirt in front and long in the back while I was in NY for the holidays...

. I happened to stumble across the Soho Skirt from Lace & Liberty and immediately fell in love. Turns out the shop was only 3 blocks from my house in SF - it was too serendipitous to not check it out. Annie and Danielle were unbelievable kind and helpful. They helped me make decisions about my style and how I might accessorize the dress. I loved that it was a minimalist, classic look, so I was able to do other weird things like shoes and jewelry. Annie and Danielle kept in touch with me the whole time about when I could expect my dress and when to come in for fittings and such. Turns out it didn't need any alterations when it came in! I am so happy how the dress turned out - it looks phenomenal in the pictures I've gotten so far. I absolutely recommend Lace & Liberty if you're looking for a fun dress, a friendly experience, and some really major designers. :)

xtremely reasonable prices. And they have a great try on at home program! You have to check out L & L... they're the best! UPDATE (post wedding): Lace and Liberty is the best bridal dress shop in the country, hands down. The entire experience for me, from beginning to end, was so enjoyable and calming. I looked at several other bridal dress shops before finding L&L and was finding the whole experience increasingly draining and stressful. Once I found L&L and worked with the amazing Annie, all of my worries subsided. Annie helped me decide on the Wonderland Skirt in Champagne (to go with the white top I had already ordered) and I am still SO in love with the skirt. I am already finding excuses to wear it again! I felt the most beautiful ever on my wedding day and am so grateful to L&L for developing such a fantastic business model with excellent customer service and the most gorgeous/highest quality bridal gowns. I cannot recommend Lace and Liberty highly enough.
