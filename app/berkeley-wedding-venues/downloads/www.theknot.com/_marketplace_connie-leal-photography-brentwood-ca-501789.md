It is with no hesitation that I’m giving Connie a 5 star review for her outstanding photography services. When we first met with Connie about doing our wedding she was so easy to t...

alk to and she really got to know us right away. This helped her with taking our engagement session because she knew how to talk to us and position us for photos. Overall we were super comfortable with Connie and she communicated well with us and felt like a friend! She ended up finding a beautiful venue for our wedding pictures as well as the engagement pictures! I always felt so confident with Connie taking my picture with her genuine compliments and her sweet and funny personality! The photos were one of the most important parts of my wedding day to me and now I have such beautiful ones to look back at forever! I loved her style and I also appreciated her letting me know I could send her some different ideas for pictures if I had any that were really important to me! She made sure to get everything I wanted and more! I was sent over a thousand gorgeous photos that I am in love with between the bridal party, getting ready, detail shots, reception shots and most importantly my husband and I. There’s not a single complaint I could have about Connie Leal Photography! Now we have someone absolutely amazing to come back to in the future for any photography needs :) we love her!

I cannot stop raving about Connie! An absolute gem of a find, I’m still getting compliments from guests about save the dates I sent out over a year ago using one of our engagement ...

photos. She listened to what we wanted, but also is so creative and came up with great ideas, took the time to really get to know us, and coached us through the engagement session/made us feel comfortable in front of the camera. By the time our wedding rolled around, we were so grateful we had already worked with Connie – it felt like hanging out with a good friend on our wedding day! Prices are very reasonable for the Bay Area, but don’t be fooled – you are NOT compromising on quality!

Connie is easily our favorite and best vendor in our whole wedding experience from beginning to end. When first reviewing her portfolio, we were captivated at how well she captures...

candid shots and how she utilizes the landscape and different lightings. Her packages are well rounded and of good value. She is responsive and on top of her emails, as well as compiling our photos (1 week after engagement shoot, and 4 weeks after wedding shoot). The photoshoots themselves were fun and efficient. We had a lot of great shots and direction from Connie, and she made us feel very comfortable, checking in on how we were feeling. She is the best!

Her and her colleague took plenty of photos and gave us the best. It was hard to choose 80 of our favorites because we love so many. We have large families and she managed to capture everyone by being everywhere throughout the entire day. She got our best angles and captured all the special little moments too. I am so grateful for such quality photos at a fair price! I can not recommend her enough.

r personalities come thru in a photo. Not only did she capture all the important moments of the Wedding day, as one can imagine of the bride and groom on the wedding day, Paul and I were going in every direction trying to see all our guests and take care of all the wedding formalities, we probably missed some funny and sweet moments that happened amongst our friends and family. Thankfully Connie was intuitive enough to capture those moments, making it seem like we were there with them the whole time. It takes a certain something to know when to capture a moment with a photograph, and Connie knew every time. We now have those images to treasure forever. I enjoyed working with Connie because she was so professional, a great communicator, and made me feel like a real person and not just some client. The overall experience was, easy going, stress fee and so much fun! We love our engagement pictures and our wedding pictures. We would highly recommend hiring Connie if you get the chance.

My relationship with Connie spans over a few years. She asked to take my photo, we did a fashion shoot, and from there I started modeling, all because of her. When I got engaged th...

ere was no question who my photographer would be. Connie Leal Photography had to do it! The way Connie works with you, makes you feel so comfortable that you are capable of getting better photos than you thought. My now husband has a great smile but he doesn't like being the center of attention and I knew that Connie would make him feel comfortable. After our Engagement shoot Thomas was thrilled, stunned, and confident. He was thrilled with the end product, stunned that he was so handsome, and through Connie's photography, saw himself the way I did. That is the gift Connie has given my husband and myself!! I never thought I would model, it was never a dream, but when I saw the very first photos from Connie I saw a completely different person than what I saw every morning in the mirror. What I love about Connie is that she is up for the challenge. She isn't "stuck in her ways" as to what wedding photography is or should be. I recall telling her, " I don't want 'wedding photography' of myself" For the photos of myself and my husband I want photos I would do on a shoot. I wanted high fashion, different. I wanted ART!! I wanted to hang it in my house and have people question where I bought "that piece" I know that is what I am getting. If you want someone who can do it all, who has fun, who is invested in you and your wedding, you want Connie. She sees the beauty in every person, every wedding, and in what makes you, you, and what makes your relationship special. By looking at your photos you will see the love you have unfold right before your eyes, because Connie has that elegance, unique eye, and passion for what she does. It was an honor to have her do my first photo shoot that kick started a career, my husbands first photo shoot that revealed another dimension, and our first photos as a married couple. Yes, needless to say, Connie Leal is the photographer I will always use for many events to come!
