Justin was absolutely phenomenal! From the start and throughout our journey he was very helpful and answered all of our questions in great detail. With the concern of what we like ...

as music vs being respectful to our families he made sure that we were comfortable with everything that was going to happen and succeeded tremendously. The conversations were easy but informative and he made the effort to get to know us as a couple and individually. When we discussed the details of the wedding we were blown away at the amount of detail he incorporated for the music, introductions, announcements and so forth. When the wedding day came we were absolutely blown away with how everything turned out. He even checked in with us when a specific request was made from one of the guests which we really appreciated and that was super respectful of him. The music was perfect AND he even joined in on one of our traditional dances making the wedding even more memorable. We would one million percent recommend anyone and everyone to book DJ Just-IN for any event! We even had several guests tell us that he was one of the best wedding DJs they have experienced. Thank you Justin for making our wedding spectacular with everything you did!

so easy and fun. On the day itself, Justin was an excellent master of ceremonies, keeping everything flowing smoothly with warmth, humor, and great energy. The music was perfect — he blended our song choices seamlessly with his own selections, and our guests were dancing all night. We also added his photobooth option, which was a huge hit! It ran so smoothly thanks to his hardworking assistant, who kept everything organized and fun for our guests. We feel so lucky we got to work with Justin — he brought such great energy to our day and helped make it truly unforgettable.

A truly phenomenal DJ!! A great dj not only has all the great songs lined up but can read a room and pump the party up and Justin did just that! We had a "happily ever after party"...

after our same day elopement, a bit unconventional so I was a little nervous about the flow of the day but he made an absolutely seamless experience. So many people after the event were gushing about him and were sad when he had to leave! 10/10

t 3 other of our friends weddings and knew that we had to get Justin for our wedding. He was kind enough to meet with us multiple times prior to the wedding to make sure everything was perfect - even though we are the ultimate procrastinating couple. On the day of my wedding, my bow-tie wouldn't fit around my neck and Justin gave me the bow-tie right off his neck - what a guy! He also provided smart uplights and our photobooth for the venue which were all great! If you are in the Bay Are, California or anywhere really, I couldn't recommend Justin strong enough!

super responsive and helpful. Justin used this app Vibo to collaborate on the song list, which made it very fun and easy! We also really enjoyed working with our DJ Yuka. We and many of our guests are Chinese/Taiwanese. Also a Taiwanese, DJ Yuka was a great fit. She was able to make all the announcements bilingual and blended world music ranging from Justin Timberlake, to Gangnam Style, to Chinese folk-rock fusion. It was a great way to showcase our heritage as well as being inclusive of all of our guests cultures and tastes.

DJ Justin was the BEST DJ and MC for our wedding this past April 2024 at the Bernardus Lodge & Spa - if you aren't sure who to book, I could recommend Justin more! From the first ...

meeting, I spoke with Justin for about an hour understanding his offerings, his style, and how we would work together - I knew I wanted to work with him right away. Justin was always patient, knowledgeable, and extremely helpful. He always made himself available whenever we needed him and he was able to work with close family and friends to coordinate support for a friend who was singing for us live and a family member who was videoing our wedding. Outside of the communication, Justin has a fantastic application including a timeline of events, music options via spotfity to upload, and a questionnaire to help you easily set up the entire wedding day. Prior to the day of, you review the application to ensure he's set for the day of the wedding! The day of the wedding couldn't have gone any smoother! Justin nailed everything from the music, to being our MC, and creating the party for us on the dance floor. Our friends and family like music across genre from country, to hip hop and R&B and Justin accomplished it all seemlessly. We absolutely loved working with Justin and couldn't recommend him more! Thank you, Justin, for everything you did to make our wedding day so incredibly special and better than we could have dreamed!

On top of his musical talents, Justin is a thoughtful MC who really knew how to read the room, entertain and energize our guests, and keep them partying all night long.

DJ Justin was literally one of the best decisions we could have made for our wedding day in November 2023. The lead up to our big day was so simple — he created an online portal fo...

On the day of he provided sound for our ceremony, and even changed out a faulty microphone 3 minutes into our ceremony without any guests even noticing. During our reception he did an incredible job commandeering the room, making announcements and introductions as necessary, but not cutting into the dancing whatsoever. He was amazing at reading the room and keeping the music fresh and upbeat, as to keep as many guests on the dance floor as possible. Seriously, best choice we could have made in terms of music. DJ Justin will make your wedding a party, highly recommend for couples trying to get downnnn on the dance floor on their wedding night <3

First things first, we had heard nothing but great things about DJ Justin and JustINtertainment from friends and cousins. They were right! His whole team is talented! We went with ...

a team DJ, the Photo Booth, and uplighting. DJ rotation made our wedding on September 16th so fun from the way he did announcements and played the right songs at the right time. I love the way he read the room and played the perfect thing. Except he didn't really take requests. Our guests and my wife danced all night! I loved that we were able to use a payment plan and the Vibo app to pick all our music. DJ Rotation even made a custom mix for our processional in a last minute idea session. So grateful. The team was great at checking in. And the quality of their equipment just made our wedding look more fancy. Our guests loved the Photo Booth. Best part!? Our DJ rotation surprised us with a video of our wedding day on social media. I cried happy tears it was soo sweet to relive! I highly recommend, 10/10!!!

We can’t say enough good things about Ryan, our DJ from JustINtertainment! Thanks to him, the vibes were flawless for our entire wedding reception. He made sure that we were taken ...

care of throughout the entire day and coordinated with the rest of our vendors to make sure the event was seamless. Also, our dance floor was LIT!! We had to drag guests off the dance floor after last call because they were having so much fun. Ryan was truly collaborative in wedding planning and such an integral part of our big day and he really knows how to get guests to the dance floor!

We worked with JustINtertainment for our wedding in April 2023 and had a wonderful experience. We worked with Justin on all of the details for the wedding, including uplighting and...

a photo booth. Communication throughout the entire process was transparent and punctual. He was always available to help us out if we had questions. Additionally I thought the pricing was very fair for everything that was provided. On the wedding day we had DJ Ryan Jay. He was great to work with, did a fantastic job as the Emcee and played great music throughout the event. I really enjoyed that they had an app for us to put the desired music into, which made the wedding day run super smoothly! I would recommend Justin and his team to anyone who is planning their wedding!

day-of to check in and see if there was anything we needed or had questions about. Also, the vibo app they use was awesome and simple to use to create the songs and vibe of our wedding. We chose DJBigCali as our DJ and it was one of the best decision we made for our wedding. He did not disappoint! Our dance floor was turned up the entire wedding, and we had so many of our wedding guests come up to us and rave about DJBigCali. They kept telling us he is the best and most fun DJ they have ever seen at a wedding. These DJ's are the REAL DEAL! They actually mix the music and groove with everyone, not just standing there with a playlist. The energy was incredible and truly made our day the best ever! I highly recommend JustINertainment and would book them again and again and again if I could do the day all over again...I wish! :) Short version: If you're looking for a DJ, book them. Don't hesitate. Don't think about it. Just do it. Make it the easiest decision so you can focus on the other planning. They got you handled!

r wedding. He gave us an app that makes the planning process super easy. Justin and his team were always available for questions and responded quickly any time we reached out. Ceremony: Justin set up the speakers and wireless mics for the officiant and groom. They worked perfectly, even though it was very windy during our ceremony. Cocktail hour/Dinner: Justin got everyone on their feet and excited for our introduction as the new Mr. & Mrs. Walking into that energy was a perfect start to the evening. He did a great job with introductions for each person giving a toast, he took some last minute changes in stride, ensuring everything went smoothly. Dancing: We provided only a handful of songs for the dancing portion of the night. Justin was able to create a full playlist from those few songs and we didn’t have to worry about anything. We basically told him that we wanted to “have a party” and boy did he deliver. Everyone loved him. We received numerous compliments from guests on how good his mixes were and how much fun they had. Justin read the room perfectly, knowing what to play and when to make sure people were on the dance floor and having fun!

The day of our wedding was a dream….during dinner, Justin played the perfect mix of R&B that catered to older and younger crowds. When it was time for the party, Justin delivered! He knew just what songs to play to keep everyone on the dance floor all night. I got SO many compliments on the music at our reception. He also provides the full package! Not only did we have him as our reception DJ, he did our ceremony sound, dancing on the clouds, uplighting, AND provided a Photo Booth with fun props. It’s so nice to work with vendors who make your life easier….do yourself a favor and hire Justin NOW!

The ultimate hype man! Don't look any further for a DJ for your wedding. DJ Justin is INCREDIBLE and my husband and I (and our friends) will be talking about our wedding reception ...

for years to come! I had one goal when it came to the reception: No dull moments and DJ Justin DELIVERED! From lighting to reading the crowd to see what song to play next, he is a GENIUS and made the entire night feel like a fun nightclub! That being said, Justin is also incredibly friendly, courteous, and was so great to work with throughout the entire planning process. He answered questions whenever I had them and gave me suggestions about songs to play during the cocktail hour. I really valued his expertise and guidance! Keep crushing it, DJ Justin!

I think JustINertainment is good overall, when we communicated with Justin he was always friendly, open, and positive. I think there were some small communication/organizational ...

things that could be improved - but most likely due to busy season with different DJ's and points of contact. I was disappointed to hear a few of the songs I selected on the app were not played at the right times. Like before the bridal entry and during the father/daughter dance. I think advice to anyone who has very specific song/vibe requests – double check with the DJ and by Justin by phone call to ensure so. We had a phone call and follow up email to ensure, but I can understand that maybe things like this should be by phone or meeting to ensure clarity. I think the app was great - they mainly use Youtube to host songs, but I also think main takeaway is if you're a couple with specific song/genre requests – don't just rely on the app they provide to communicate that and make sure you double, triple communicate with the team there. I did so, but I think maybe it didn't come across as seriously as I meant it! My friends were requesting songs to the DJ by the end of the evening (which I am aware can be annoying to DJ's) but I actually appreciated it since we wanted songs we knew we loved (and had taken time to had put them into the app.) I know this can be tricky in general, so I say this knowing that overall our DJ did the best they could, and most likely didn't know that we were a bit picky about our song selections. Our photobooth pictures and options were great and I'm very happy about that! Overall, I will say that everything seemed professional, and I think they did the best they could. I don't regret going with them, but if you're looking for anything different at all with a cultural aspect, special unique moment, or very specific genre aspect – be very clear.
