After researching wedding locations and narrowing the list to your potential favorites, you could be stuck wondering what's next on your [wedding venue booking checklist](https://www.theknot.com/content/booking-reception-site). You might think visiting the site is the next step, but there are at least 64 questions to ask wedding venues you need to know even before you set foot in a space. While it's important to see the venue in person, you must prepare yourself to ask specific wedding planning questions so you can book your wedding venue with confidence. "By asking the right questions at the right time, couples can make an informed decision that ensures their wedding day is as smooth and stress-free as possible," explains Brittany Alexander, Catering Sales Manager at [Yours Truly](https://www.ihg.com/vignettecollection/hotels/us/en/washington/wasvc/hoteldetail) in Washington, DC.

But even before asking these questions, you can narrow down your wedding venue options by using the convenient filters on The Knot Venue Marketplace. You can sort by everything from guest capacity to [wedding venue cost](https://www.theknot.com/content/average-cost-reception-venue) and even certain amenities to help with [finding wedding venues](https://www.theknot.com/content/finding-a-wedding-reception-location) near you that fit your needs. From there, it's time to dive even deeper with your wedding venue research. For example, you'll want to ensure there's enough parking if your guests are driving in for the occasion. Or that the venue has [ADA-compliant facilities](https://www.theknot.com/content/handicap-accessible-wedding-venues). With everything from the number of bathrooms to alcohol restrictions, our list of wedding venue questions has you covered. See the list of inquiries to know about before, during and after your site tour below.

## Questions to Ask a Wedding Venue Before Your Tour

You can ask the below wedding venue questions over the phone or in an [inquiry email](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-vendor-email-templates). Just ensure you sort out your wedding details ahead of time so that when the venue staff responds, your answers aren't vague.

### 1\. When is the venue available?

If you have your heart set on a specific wedding date and aren't flexible about moving it, you definitely need to ask this question. Hopefully, the venue is available for your desired date––otherwise, you'll have to keep looking. If you don't have a particular date in mind, ask the venue about what dates are open for your preferred season and year. Kelly McKinney, Social Catering Sales Manager at [Fairmont Royal York](https://www.thefairmontroyalyork.com/), explains that "unless you have a specific desired wedding date, try keeping your options open by providing a range of a few months you are looking for. For example, I'm looking for a Saturday or Sunday between April and June." 

### 2\. How far in advance can I reserve the venue?

For couples who've had their hearts set on a particular wedding venue, we suggest asking how far out you can reserve it. This question is especially important for popular locations. Some venues require a year in advance, while others are more flexible on timing for signing the [wedding venue contract. ](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-reception-venue-contract)

### 3\. What is the venue's rental fee?

On average, couples spend 37% of their total wedding budget on the venue's rental fee and catering, according to [The Knot Real Weddings Study](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-budget-ways-to-save-money). With such a hefty sum going towards the venue, it's important to know exactly how much you'll be spending. 

Remember that your [venue's rental fee](https://www.theknot.com/content/average-cost-reception-venue) and [catering](https://www.theknot.com/content/average-cost-wedding-catering) will likely take up about half of your total [wedding budget](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-budget-ways-to-save-money). Allison Jacques, Director of Events at [Hyatt Regency Lost Pines Resort & Spa](https://usw2.nyl.as/t1/51/1j57q8mu75m3rhu3fcysbmhqu/0/bf1608e8e656157c1612cef6a850e26e449378bd2d074858ce142376ac31537b), encourages to-be-weds to ask what costs are associated with the space. "It is important to understand what fees apply to rent venue spaces as some may require a room rental, food and beverage minimum, or both combined." If the entire venue cost (not just the food and beverage minimum) doesn't fit within your budget, you may have to move on unless you're open to cutting something else.

### 4\. What is included in the venue rental fee?

Don't simply ask for the total number, but ask for specifics regarding what is included in the fee you're paying. This could be rentals, assistance from a venue coordinator or an in-house wedding baker. As Lauren Rodriguez, Event Producer at The Line DC, explains, "you want to make sure you're budgeting for a well-rounded event." The reverse of this question is to ask "what does the venue _not_ provide that I need to handle myself?" Forman Eadie is partial to this question as she notes that "clients like to know what the venue provides versus what they need to bring in." It's always best to ask rather than assume.

### 5\. What is the style of the venue?

This will likely be the most obvious yes or no decision about your venue. Are you envisioning a romantic rustic atmosphere, but the venue staff describes the place as a sleek and modern loft? Then you'll probably need to cross the space off your list immediately.

### 6\. Does the venue have space for a ceremony and reception?

To take some hassle out of planning and traveling for guests, some couples try to have their ceremony and reception at the same venue. If keeping everything at one location is important to you, ask the tour guide if there are separate ceremony and reception spaces.

### 7\. What does a tour venue tour entail?

Shelby Getsla, Wedding & Marketing Manager at [Dream Inn Santa Cruz](https://www.dreaminnsantacruz.com/) offers this advice: "Before a venue tour, be sure to ask what the tour entails. How many spaces are available for viewing? Does the venue offer a menu tasting or equivalent? This will help you maximize your time and gather all relevant information before you commit." 

### 8\. What is the space's capacity? How many people does the space accommodate?

A venue's capacity directly relates to your [guest list](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-to-make-your-wedding-guest-list) and wedding budget. If you love the space but it only comfortably fits 75 people and your guest list is close to 200 (not including your pros), you have to decide if having the venue or your guest count is more important to you. Forman Eadie explains that "it is important to ensure the venue they are interested in can accommodate their guest count before inquiring further about the event."

The capacity is more than a simple number. If you're envisioning a sit-down event with space for a dance floor, but the capacity is based on a standing cocktail-style event, you'll end up in a tough spot. 

Jacques notes that "understanding the capacity of the space based on your event needs is key. Venues may be able to accommodate a larger group in a reception style setting versus a seated dinner when seating is not required for all guests." 

### 9\. Can we hop on a call before I come for a tour?

"If possible, it's a good idea to start with a preliminary call with the venue to discuss your needs and request an initial proposal," says Jules Miller, Social Events Manager at[ Hotel Lilien](https://www.hotellilien.com/) in Tannersville, NY. "This helps ensure you don't fall in love with a venue that doesn't align with your budget or vision. By the time you schedule venue tours, your list should ideally be narrowed down to locations that fit within your budget. Once on-site, you can focus on discussing event logistics like flow and power sources while also taking the opportunity to connect emotionally with the space."

## Questions to Ask a Wedding Venue During Your Tour

Once you've scheduled a venue tour, it's time to get answers to the crucial details that could influence whether you book or not. Here are the top questions to ask when touring a wedding venue.

### 10\. Is there an area to have the cocktail hour?

Who doesn't love a fun [cocktail hour](https://www.theknot.com/content/ultimate-cocktail-hour-guide) with tasty drinks and food? But before you create the menu, you have to talk about logistics. Ask if the venue has a place for guests to mingle after the ceremony. 

### Find your kind of venue

From barns to ballrooms, discover reception venues that feel like you.

### 11\. What's the walking/driving distance from the ceremony location?

If you're hosting your wedding ceremony and reception in different locations, this is an important question to ask the reception venue as you'll need to know how long it'll take to get from one site to the other. Also, ask what the traffic is like around your wedding time to ensure you and your guests don't get stuck on the road.

### 12\. Is the venue near hotels, and can you recommend any?

Don't know what to ask a wedding venue? Try this inquiry since it could impact whether you book. If guests have to drive a long way to get from their hotel to the venue and back, we think it's best to avoid that venue––especially if you're not providing [wedding transportation](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-transportation-tips). Usually, anything over 30 minutes is a big ask.

### 13\. Is the venue near public transportation?

You'll want to know if the venue's close to any public transportation, cab or ride-share services in the area for guests to use. After all, nobody should be driving a car after consuming alcohol.

### 14\. What aesthetic features does the venue have?

You should ensure any of the venue's standout features blend in with your decor vision. For example, is there a rooftop or pool? Is the venue on a waterfront? Are there any breathtaking views, incredible interiors or nature areas?

### 15\. What does your outdoor space look like?

This is one of the most vital questions to ask when looking at wedding venues. So if you want an outdoor soiree, ensure there's enough room to comfortably fit guests, pros, rentals, the cocktail hour area and reception.

### 16\. Does the venue have a tent or backup plan if I want an outdoor ceremony?

It doesn't matter which season you want your wedding in; you should always have a [plan b for outdoor weddings](https://www.theknot.com/content/outdoor-wedding-backup-plan). "If your venue has an outdoor space, always ask to see what the weather back up is," says Rodriguez. Ask the venue staff if they have tents or an indoor area for you and your guests to move to if there's inclement weather or other issues. "You want to love both options equally, as the weather is completely out of anyone's control," advises the pro. 

Miller goes on to add that couples should "make sure you're comfortable with the rain plan your venue offers, including how it accommodates your guest count without incurring significant additional costs. Keep in mind that renting a tent for a rain plan is quite common and should be factored into your budget if your wedding includes outdoor elements."

### 17\. How many hours does the rental cover?

Besides the ceremony and reception, you'll want to know the exact time frame you have to set up, celebrate and clean up your wedding. You don't want to be charged extra if the venue has to keep the lights on for 30 more minutes.

### 18\. How many weddings does the venue allow within a day?

"Many venues have multiple ballroom spaces for weddings, so it is best to inquire about what spaces you'd share with another event," explains McKinney. If you're having an evening wedding, you don't want your guests arriving to see the afternoon wedding's rentals being packed up. It's normal for venues to host more than one wedding in a day (especially at a hotel), but make sure there won't be any visible crossover.

### 19\. What are your electricity capabilities?

This question is twofold: You want to know if the venue has enough outlets and power for every pro requiring electricity, and you also want to get an idea of the lighting. Is it extremely fluorescent or dim? Can the venue project the uplighting hue you want onto the dance floor? These are all crucial things to know—especially for evening receptions.

Getsla explains that "this is especially important if you are interested in live music or large DJ setups. The last thing you want to do is book a venue or music services that are not compatible—or worse yet have unexpected 'quiet time' if a breaker flips on wedding day." 

### 20\. Is the venue ADA-compliant?

Your [wedding should be as disability-friendly](https://www.theknot.com/content/accessible-wedding) as possible. That includes but isn't limited to a leveled or ramped primary entrance, accessible doors, bathrooms and parking, working elevators and inclusive seating.

### 21\. Is there parking for guests on-site? If so, is there a fee?

For traveling guests, you'll need to have a place for them to park their vehicles. Ask the wedding venue staff if there's an area for cars, how many parking spaces there are and if there's a fee. Consider paying for the guest parking fee if your wedding budget allows.

### 22\. How many restrooms does the venue have?

You don't want to have long restroom lines at your wedding. Talk to the venue staff about how many bathrooms are on the property. If you feel like there are too few, but you love the venue, consider renting portable bathrooms––there are some really luxurious ones nowadays.

### 23\. Where can we safely store wedding gifts?

This might not be something you have considered, but [wedding gift theft](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-to-prevent-wedding-gift-theft) is a real thing. Find out if there is a room with a lock where you can place your gifts so there are no issues.

### 24\. Does the venue have a dance floor?

If getting down on the [dance floor](https://www.theknot.com/content/12-ways-to-customize-your-dance-floor) is a top priority for you and your guests, ask the wedding venue employees if there is one. If the venue doesn't have one, ensure there's enough space in the reception area for you to add a rented one.

### 25\. Are there rooms for the couple and wedding party to get ready before the wedding?

For those who've selected a venue that works for their ceremony and reception, you'll need a dressing room to start the getting ready process. Check if the venue has suites for you, your partner and your attendants so everyone can prepare for the big day together. This will also help decrease your chance of running late since you'll already be on the property. 

### 26\. Do you require a wedding planner? 

Getsla advises to-be-weds to "be sure to ask if there is a venue coordinator included in your booking or if a wedding planner is required. Some venues require this, some offer the service internally. Keep in mind, not all venue coordinators work the same. Get into the specifics. This will help you determine if you need additional planning or day-of services, or if the venue can take care of it all.

### 27\. What coordination services, if any, does the venue offer? 

While some venues require an outside planner, others include some level of coordination as part of their rental package. This is something that Joe Volpe, co-founder and CEO at[ Cescaphe](https://www.cescaphe.com/) (the event partner of [The Bellevue](https://www.thebellevuehotel.com/) in Philadelphia, encourages to-be-weds to inquire about. "Some venues simply provide the space, and then you are in charge of every other aspect. There are full-service venues who guide you through the process so you stay on an appropriate planning timeline and are thinking about everything you will need ahead of time."

### 28\. How long have you been at this venue?

Joy Ehlert, Senior Catering Sales Manager and Marriott Certified Wedding Planner at[ The Joseph Nashville](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/bnalj-the-joseph-a-luxury-collection-hotel-nashville/overview/?scid=f2ae0541-1279-4f24-b197-a979c79310b0) encourages nearlyweds to get to know the venue manager as they'll have a hand in making your experience at the venue a smooth one. "With any profession, there is always a learning curve, an adjustment period when you are in a new environment. From simple tasks, like finding equipment in a pinch, to the art of knowing which way the wind will carry your veil during your first look on the terrace, time spent nurturing the ins and outs of a location can be a critical element in which people you can trust with an occasion as big as a wedding."

### 29\. How long have you been in the industry? 

In addition to asking how long a pro has worked at a given venue, Ehlert also suggests getting to know their overall background. According to her, "Your event professionals should be connected within the wedding community to make referrals, offer ideas to create the experience that your inspirations suggest, pinpoint alternative arrangements (a backup plan!) should an emergency arise." 

### 30\. Can you walk us through a typical event here? How do things normally flow?

"During the tour, it's helpful to ask for a walkthrough of the event day flow," says Janine Anderson, Director of Sales and Catering at [Hutton Hotel](https://www.huttonhotel.com/) in Nashville, TN. "Understanding how the venue transitions from the ceremony to the reception clarifies logistics and enhances the guest experience." The team at [Keeneland](https://www.keeneland.com/) in Kentucky concurs. Hannah Sawyer (Direct of Events) and Mandy Vaughn (Director of Hospitality and Sales Experience) offer this advice: "Couples should ask about how a typical wedding flows in a venue to ensure it aligns with their vision for the day." 

### 31\. Any unusual regulations to know?

From noise ordinances to fire codes, it's wise to get a sense of the legal constraints you may have to deal with. For example, "it helps to know what is allowed or not allowed since there may be components to your wedding day that require a flame for the ceremony," says Jesse Gonzalez, Weddings and Social Catering Manager at[ The Joule](https://www.thejouledallas.com/) in Dallas, TX.

Check to see if there's a noise restriction after certain times. Many venues don't allow you to play loud music past 10:30 p.m. or so, which won't work if you want to dance until midnight. "It is crucial for clients to know this before signing with a venue so their event doesn't end abruptly and they are aware of any noise constraints and venue curfews," says Forman Eadie.

### Questions to Ask a Wedding Venue Regarding Finances

If you and your partner are happy with all the above, you're ready to move on to the next step. Here are key financial questions to ask your wedding venue. Getting clarity on these questions will help with [saving on a wedding venue](https://www.theknot.com/content/save-money-wedding-venue-menu). 

### 32\. What's the deposit, cancellation and refund policy?

Before accepting a new job, you'd want to look at your benefits and official offer letter before you sign on the dotted line––the same goes for your venue. Ask if you can see a sample contract or have their deposit, cancellation and refund policy outlined on paper. Things happen, and it's better to know you can recover losses _before_ you book your venue.

### 33\. Are there any additional fees we should be aware of?

It's critical that you uncover [the 'why' behind venue costs](https://www.theknot.com/content/why-are-wedding-venues-so-expensive). [Hidden wedding fees](https://www.theknot.com/content/hidden-wedding-costs) can add up, making a sizable dent in your budget. "Make sure to ask what additional fees apply to include service charge, taxes, and other labor fees," advises Jacques. "Oftentimes you will need to pay for additional labor related to bars and food action stations." Be sure to ask about taxes, gratuities, service charges and more to ensure you're clear on your venue's total cost. There is also a chance that the venue may charge a fee for bringing in vendors that are not on their pre-approved vendor list—clarify this ahead of time so you don't encounter unwanted sticker shock. 

### 34\. Do you have liability insurance?

If a wedding venue doesn't have [liability insurance](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-insurance-101), you'll have to purchase your own. This is important in case someone gets injured, your venue is damaged or some other mishap occurs on the big day.

### 35\. Does the venue offer flexible payment plans?

To serve couples of different financial backgrounds, some wedding venues offer payment plans. The venue is only one of many things you'll be putting your money towards, so don't be afraid to ask if they have this option if it will help take some of the financial burden off your shoulders.

### 36\. What payment methods does the venue accept?

Don't assume your preferred payment method works for the venue. There might be a possibility the venue takes only checks or certain credit cards.

### 37\. What kind of packages do you offer?

Getsla encourages nearlyweds to "ask if there are additional packages that the venue offers—setup, enhancements, unique additions. It's your wedding day! Take as much stress off your plate as you can and take advantage of venue packages. Who doesn't love a one-stop-shop?"

### 38\. What is the typical budget range for weddings at your venue?

While tools like The Knot Budget Advisor can let you know information about average wedding costs in your area, it can be helpful to ask the venue about the typical price range for weddings hosted at their venue. "Asking and understanding the price range for weddings at the venue is essential for establishing budget alignment, which saves time and ensures expectations are managed," notes Anderson. 

### 39\. Do you prices change by day of the week or time of year? 

If you have your heart set on a certain venue, consider being more flexible on your specific date. Often a Saturday will be more expensive than a Monday, for example. "The best advice I can give a couple is to not get stuck on a particular date. Fall in love with your venue, and then find a date that works within your budget and guest count," advises Volpe.

## Questions to Ask a Wedding Venue Regarding Food and Beverages

[Wedding catering](https://www.theknot.com/content/average-cost-wedding-catering) is one of the most significant parts of the celebration because it fills the belly and warms the heart. Here are food and drink-related questions to ask a wedding venue before booking.

### 40\. Does the venue have an in-house caterer?

Some venues want you to use their services from beginning to end, which is why in-house caterers are provided. If they do have one, ask them about their menu offerings, if they can accommodate dietary restrictions and when you can schedule a menu tasting.

### 41\. If catering is provided, what is the food and beverage minimum?

Gonzalez says that "the food and beverage minimum is crucial as a first step to understanding, as there are typically additional fees, such as service charges and taxes, applied to the minimum spend requirement. It's always best to review the minimum, the venue's service charge and state tax." 

### 42\. Do you allow outside catering?

If a venue has an in-house caterer, they may require you to use it and not bring in a separate caterer. "Hotels often prefer to provide all the catering from our kitchens, so it is best to confirm ahead of time," notes McKinney. 

### 43\. Is there a kitchen on-site?

You've probably already guessed it, but if the venue doesn't have its own caterer, you'll have to hire one yourself. That isn't a big deal in itself, but you do need to ensure the venue has a full kitchen for your desired catering team to work.

### 44\. Am I allowed to bring our own alcohol?

Bringing alcohol is one way to cut corners on costs, but some venues, especially hotels, don't allow you to bring outside alcohol. Some wedding venues may not permit alcohol at all on the premises. So, ask if there are any alcohol restrictions and if the venue has a liquor license, which means you can only have wine and beer.

### 45\. Is there a corkage fee?

If your wedding venue permits you to bring your own alcohol, they most likely will charge you a corkage fee. This is the same setup restaurants have if you bring your own bottle of wine. This fee sometimes includes the venue waitstaff helping open and serve the [wedding wine](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-to-choose-wine-wedding).

### 46\. Does the venue have an in-house baker?

There are a few venues that require you to use their in-house cake baker, while others allow you to select an outside baker. If you must use the venue's baker, look at photos of their work to ensure you're comfortable moving forward.

### 47\. Is there a cake-cutting fee?

Also known as the cakeage fee, the [wedding cake-cutting fee](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-cake-cutting-fee) is a rate venues charge for cakes made at other bakeries. The wedding cake-cutting fee pushes the couples to use the in-house baker, but it also gives the venue waitstaff fair compensation for cutting, plating and serving the cake, which is usually a service included in the price.

### 48\. Do you offer a menu tasting? 

If the venue is going to be handling the catering, it's important to understand what their process is for aligning on, and tasting, the menu that's being planned. McKinney encourages to-be-weds to get clarity on these aspects of catering tastings: "Do they offer tastings? How many guests can attend? Can you bring in your own alcohol? If so, what is the corkage fee?"

## Questions to Ask a Wedding Venue Regarding Vendors

As you would for your guests, you should ensure your[ wedding pros](https://www.theknot.com/content/ones-to-watch) are taken care of. These are the questions to ask the wedding venue tour guide on behalf of your vendors.

### 49\. Can the venue accommodate a DJ or live band?

Before you book DJ Pauly D or ask your uncle's blues band to perform at your wedding, you'll need to know how much space the venue has for your acts. Some venues have limited space that could prevent you from hosting a [DJ or live musicians](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-reception-music-bands-vs-djs).

### 50\. Do you have a sound system and microphones?

Whether it's for your ceremony prayers, a live band or the reception wedding speeches, you'll need a sound system and microphones. Some vendors provide these items themselves, but it doesn't hurt to ask the venue employees what equipment they have.

### 51\. What time can my vendors start setting up?

This is one of the most important logistic questions to ask at a wedding venue––especially if your potential venue hosts numerous events in one day. Knowing when your vendors can arrive will help you plan your event and determine if there's enough time for them to set up before the ceremony.

### 52\. Can I hire outside vendors?

This is a prime question to ask wedding venues because some have strict rules around which outside services they allow on their property. The wedding venue might even have a [preferred vendor list](https://www.theknot.com/content/approved-vendor-lists) you can choose from, while others could require lengthy contracts for outside vendors due to liability issues.

### 53\. Do you require all vendors to provide a COI (certificate of insurance)?

Lots of great things can happen on your wedding day, but there can be some accidents. The champagne tower assembled by the bar team could topple over, or sparklers set up by the lighting staff can catch a curtain on fire. You want to be covered for every possibility, and so does your venue.

### 54\. What are the logistics for pros and rentals?

Some rental companies charge extra if they have to walk up and down stairs, so you need to know if there are stairs, a service elevator, a loading dock or a separate entrance for them. You should also ask if there are additional charges for any weekday/weekend drop-offs or pickups if they want to start delivering rentals ahead of time or pick something up a day later and what their time windows are.

## Questions to Ask a Wedding Venue Regarding Decor

Most likely, how your wedding looks is extremely significant. That's why you need to have the things to ask a wedding venue below on your checklist.

### 55\. Can we bring our own decorations?

Some vendors have restrictions on the kinds of outside decor they permit. Share this information with your wedding decorator and planner so they can know what they're working with.

### 56\. Am I allowed to rearrange anything at the venue? Can we remove art that's hanging on the walls?

This is an especially important question to ask wedding reception venues. There are some wedding venues that have strict rules around rearranging anything on site. Whether it's a liability or safety issue, it's best to ask this wedding venue question upfront. This will allow you to begin imagining what the venue would look like on your special day. 

### 57\. What decor, if any, is included in my rental fee?

Along with understanding what you can and cannot bring from outside regarding decorations, be sure to ask what kind of decor they provide. This will keep you from doubling up on items, bringing anything that may clash or spending money unnecessarily.

Jacques explains that "each venue is different in terms of what is included in the rental. Some venues may provide the space only and all other equipment items are rented separately. Hotels historically will include tables, chairs, staging, dance floor, chinaware, glassware, silverware, and linens creating a one-stop-shop approach to venue selection."

### 58\. Do you have open-flame regulations?

If your perfect wedding involves an aisle lined with lit candles, you need to talk to the venue team about their open-flame policy. Some venues allow candles but have a restriction on the amount, while others prefer you to have flameless candles.

### 59\. Can you share lighting and decor ideas you've done for past events?

Some venues provide their own decorating and lighting services. If your potential venue offers this, we suggest asking them to show photos and videos of their previous work so you can decide if their look is right for you.

### 60\. Does the venue offer set up and break down services?

Setting up and breaking down the wedding might be a courtesy in the contract or an add-on to the final bill. Either way, you need to ask this wedding venue question to compare fares with other vendors.

### Questions to Ask a Wedding Venue at the Final Meeting

You're almost at the finish line. Before you book, bring these questions to ask a wedding venue team member.

### 61\. When is the final venue payment due?

Ensure you're on the same page about the venue's payment schedule. You don't want to lose out on your favorite wedding venue because you didn't confirm the payment deadline.

### 62\. Who can we contact throughout the planning process?

You might not believe it, but you probably have more questions for the venue staff down the road. Ask if you'll have a point of contact, like an on-site wedding venue coordinator, to answer your questions and help coordinate your planning needs. Exchange phone numbers and emails so you both can communicate efficiently and as quickly as possible.

### 63\. Do you provide signage, or will we have to bring our own?

To keep your guests in the right place at all times, you'll need [wedding signs](https://www.theknot.com/content/pretty-diy-wedding-signs). Whether it's to guide them to the restrooms or direct them to the parking area, clear signs are a must. Ask the venue employees if they can provide signs for your event.

### 64\. Can we visit the venue a few days early with our vendors so they can see the layout?

This is one of the best questions to ask during the final wedding venue walk-through. Vendors like your photographer, videographer, caterer and more might want to walk around your venue to get a better look at the layout. This helps them better visualize setups and make their jobs easier. Ask the venue staff if doing this two to three days before the wedding is possible. We also advise coordinating all necessary vendors to be there on one day so the walkthrough is done in one fell swoop.
