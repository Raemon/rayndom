Got a wedding shower on your calendar? You might be wondering if you [need to buy a gift](https://www.theknot.com/content/is-wedding-gift-necessary) or if your dazzling presence is enough. While showing up ready to celebrate is always appreciated, a bridal shower gift is typically expected. The prewedding tradition has long been about helping future spouses stock their home for married life, so it's considered good etiquette to bring something for the bride or the couple. Unless the invitation specifically says "no gifts, please," plan to arrive with both your social charm and a thoughtful present.

That begs the question: What's a good wedding shower gift? To help you out, we've rounded up classic and creative ideas, starting with some top picks from our editors. Keep reading for a comprehensive list of the best bridal and couple shower gifts.

## **What to Get for a Bridal Shower**

Don't show up empty-handed! Here's what you need to know about shopping for gifts for a bridal or wedding shower.

### **What kind of gift do you buy for a bridal shower?**

Home essentials and wedding-related items are popular couple and bridal shower gift ideas. Think: small kitchen appliances, cookware sets, elegant tableware, personalized home decor, spa gift baskets or travel accessories for their honeymoon. Some showers may have specific themes, like a "[Stock-the-Bar" party](https://www.theknot.com/content/stock-the-bar-gift-ideas), which can help guide your gift choice. If the celebration is just for the bride, it's okay to choose something personal for her, like a classic white lace robe or [lingerie](https://www.theknot.com/content/lingerie-shower-gift-ideas). The challenge often lies in understanding the couple's preferences, such as which coffee machine they'll use most. You can ask the event host for guidance and, of course, check out the couple's wedding registry. To-be-weds spend a lot of time curating their wedding gift wishlist, making it the ultimate resource for selecting a bridal shower gift they'll truly need and want. (Use our guide to [find a couple's wedding website](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-to-find-a-couples-wedding-web-page) and, thus, their registry on The Knot.)

When you want a bridal shower gift that stands out, wine probably isn't the best choice—or is it? This custom-etched wine bottle is a special bridal shower gift idea. After the couple marvels at their beautifully inscribed names and savors the full-bodied cabernet sauvignon inside, they'll hold onto this keepsake forever. They could even transform the bottle into a photo holder. Simply add a [wire card holder](https://www.amazon.com/Holders-Picture-Birthday-Accessories-Decoration/dp/B07XGHW351?tag=tkcommerce-218-20) that they can stake into the cork once all the wine is gone to show off their wedding stationery or printed pictures.
