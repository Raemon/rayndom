Olivia and her team, wow. Just WOW. I had a vision for what I wanted for our florals (pastel palette), and I almost made the mistake of not splurging a little on our flowers. Trus...

t me, as my photographer reminded me, your flowers are in basically EVERY PHOTO! Olivia really truly understood the assignment. And she was so easy to get ahold of and she even let us take home the flowers from our mock-up. Her pricing is super transparent, which we were so grateful for! We got so many compliments on how all of our flowers were done. From the seating chart, to our welcome sign, to the WEDDING ARCH AND BOUQUET of my literal dreams - I was just in awe. She even helped us package the florals so that we could take them home! AND she knew I wanted to preserve my bridal bouquet, so she gave me some flowers at the end of the night that looked not as sad 😅 If you’re looking for an amazing garden-style vibe with your florals, even if it’s just your bouquet - go with Olivia!! You’ll love it!!

I carried my bouquet around all night and even forced my now-husband to drive two centerpieces to our honeymoon to decorate our room because I wasn’t quite ready to say goodbye, lol! Beyond that, she’s so kind, easy-going, and hardworking. She and her team made our wedding day a dream! Thank you, Olivia! I hope to work with you again!! I would highly recommend for any and all projects!

I cannot express enough gratitude for the exquisite floral arrangements provided by La Olivia for our wedding. From the moment I met with Olivia, I was blown away by her creativity...

, professionalism, and passion for her craft. Every detail, from the breathtaking bouquets to the elegant centerpieces, was meticulously curated to perfection. Working with La Olivia was an absolute dream. She took the time to understand our vision, style, and color palette, and then transformed our ideas into floral masterpieces that exceeded our expectations. The flowers were not just arrangements; they were works of art that added an enchanting and romantic ambiance to our special day. The quality of the flowers was exceptional. Each bloom was fresh, vibrant, and fragrant, showcasing the expertise and care that La Olivia invests in their work. The variety of flowers and foliage used in the arrangements created a harmonious blend of colors and textures, making every bouquet and centerpiece truly unique and eye-catching. What impressed us the most was the attention to detail in every arrangement. The creativity and artistry displayed in her work were truly remarkable. My bridal bouquet was a showstopper, with a carefully curated selection of flowers that perfectly complemented my gown and added a touch of elegance to my overall look. The bridesmaids' bouquets were equally stunning and coordinated flawlessly with the theme of the wedding. The centerpieces at the reception were nothing short of spectacular. La Olivia effortlessly captured the essence of our wedding theme and translated it into the floral decor. The tables were adorned with lush arrangements & delicate blooms, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere for our guests. Her ability to transform a simple space into a romantic haven with its flowers was truly magical. Throughout the entire process, La Olivia demonstrated exceptional professionalism and a genuine passion for her craft. She was responsive to our ideas and concerns, offering valuable suggestions and expert guidance along the way. Her dedication to ensuring our complete satisfaction was evident in the final result – a breathtaking floral display that left us and our guests in awe. On top of it all, Olivia graciously styled our space with extra flowers to tie everything in. In summary, La Olivia is more than a floral service; she is an artist who has a deep understanding of her craft and a genuine desire to make dreams come true. If you're looking for wedding flowers that are not only beautiful but also crafted with love, creativity, and attention to detail, La Olivia is the perfect choice. Our wedding day was made even more magical thanks to her incredible talent and dedication. We are forever grateful, thank you so much!

Olivia has put together the flowers for my wedding earlier this month at Nella Terra and she is beyond amazing!! She was very easy to talk to and was super helpful in finalizing ...

on the floral details as she also has wedding planning experience. As with many planning, as I added more items on my wish list, the final quote nearly doubled my initial budget. When I shared my concern with her, without any hesitation, she thought of several solutions to still get the look of what I want at a more reasonable price range. On the final planning call before hanging up, she told me "please enjoy your big day because we will make sure everything is perfect" and this was SO reassuring and touching because I was getting very stressed as the big day approached. She sure kept her promise because everything was everything I had imagined and more. Many of my guests complimented the beautiful florals and the candles arrangement and I received several pictures the next day for the guests who were able to take the flowers home. I definitely recommend Olivia as your wedding florist. Thank you Olivia for making me the happiest bride!

Hiring Olivia was one of the best decisions I made for a number of reasons! First of all, she is true artist who can do it all, from the most modest to the most extravagant wedding...

s - just take a look at her impressively extensive website! I told her I was on a tight budget but was still hoping for the elegant, high quality look that she creates, and she really worked with me to stay within my budget and was always so kind about it even though I know she also does a lot of higher end gigs! She was reliable with her communication and I always felt confident that she would deliver with beautiful arrangements and professionalism, but she really outdid herself on the actual day! Not only did she deliver much more than I expected with extra floral touches she added, she literally saved the day when my aunt forgot to pack her traditional Korean outfit's skirt! We had it overnighted and it still didn't show up on time, but thank God Olivia was my florist because she actually had han boks to rent and rented us a skirt for such an affordable price! She's such a sweetheart and really cares about her clients - don't hesitate to book her! You'll be lucky to have her <3

My husband and I got married on April 10, 2023 at the Brazilian Room at Tilden Park in Berkeley, CA. Olivia provided our floral arrangements for the arc, aisle, bouquets, boutonnie...

res, flower girl basket, and centerpieces. From our first conversation, Olivia was really great. She took time to understand our vision and even worked with me to help come up with options in our price range. I crafted our centerpiece structures myself - and I am not at all a professional so they were super fragile - but Olivia worked with them so gently and they came out beautifully. She even made some last minute adjustments because we'd ended up adding a few more tables on short notice. On the day of, she showed up and helped place all of the florals and it all looked so perfect - exactly what we wanted. I would definitely recommend her for all of your florist needs! Thanks so much again Olivia for making our day even more beautiful!

My husband and I loved working with Olivia! We initially reached out to her to acquire her services for our wedding. Olivia sent over her extensive catalog and set up a Zoom call. ...

We absolutely loved that she had a full catalog built out with photos and pricing. This allowed for full transparency and no unexpected surprises. During our initial call, she pulled up an itemized spreadsheet to track all of our selections which included centerpieces (flowers, eucalyptus leaves & floating candles), a floral arrangement for the mantel, florals for the sweetheart table, bridal bouquets, boutonnieres, corsages and much more. We had also been looking on Etsy for our signage items. Come to find out, Olivia does that as well! This was a life saver because she was able to print our seating chart, place cards, dinner menus, bar menu, table numbers and welcome sign. Everything turned our perfect and absolutely stunning! We are still receiving rave reviews and compliments from friends & family about the details. Olivia listened to our desires and made each and every one of our dreams come to life! She's professional and a joy to work with. I highly recommend her services for future brides!

Olivia made that easy for me by providing a catalogue of everything she offers (florals, centerpieces, rentals, table settings, you name it!) this made my life so much easier so I could just pick what I needed! On the day of, Olivia delivered and decorated our reception room beautifully. She even brought an additional 2 large floral centerpieces she used for another wedding! They really filled the room nicely. I am beyond grateful to have worked with Olivia who made planning my wedding easier and I can’t recommend her enough

First let's just start by saying that Olivia is an artist. She knows her way with flowers, greens, and everything in between. She offers a range of decor items but I have to say th...

at her way with florals is magical. We met Olivia through a friend who also used her for their wedding. They had a tight budget and so did we! I had already known she did great work for our friends so we had no hesitation when it came to our relationship. Our friends had wanted a large floral arch but their budget couldn't support both an arch as well as florals throughout the venue so after the ceremony was over, Olivia repurposed all of the flower from the arch throughout the wedding! For us, our budget was even smaller (and we were working with post-COVID increased floral rates) and all we wanted were just some florals/greenery on the tables. We didn't think we could afford anything more and to make things easy, I just gave her a color palette to work with and asked her to put together whatever she wanted/could that would work with our venue and budget. When our day came - Olivia did not only deliver what we asked for but she went above and beyond. She had florals for the tables, around the venue, ourselves, AND she was only supposed to drop off and set up the flowers but she stayed longer to set extra flowers at everyones place settings to make each guest s experience even more special. Without her, our wedding would not have felt as ethereal as it did, and for that we are grateful. Bottom line: Olivia is talented. Start the conversation and take a look at her work, you will not be disappointed.
