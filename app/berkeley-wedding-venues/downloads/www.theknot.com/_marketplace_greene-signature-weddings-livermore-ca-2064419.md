er, she made contact with our established vendors and then helped us make additional connections through her trusted vendors. And from the moment those vendors arrived on the day, she was there coordinating and organizing everything until the last vendor and guest was gone. Throughout our time together, she used a system to track our progress and help us stay within budget. She felt like family from the beginning and became a family member by the end. She made our wedding day extraordinary.

I can’t express how truly blessed and lucky my husband and I feel to have had the opportunity to work with Ana. We are not from the Bay Area, and knowing how stressful wedding plan...

ning can be—especially while planning from afar—we knew we needed professional help. We had already secured our venue at The Club at Ruby Hill, so we were looking for a day-of coordinator to help organize everything else. Ana was at the top of Ruby Hill’s preferred vendor list, so I quickly reached out to her. That same day, we already had a meeting scheduled. From our very first meeting, she was professional, organized, and committed to understanding our vision. Ana was in constant communication with us, always checking in to see if we had any questions or if there were any changes she needed to know about. Her close attention to detail and the vision boards she created to capture everything we wanted show the time, passion, and creativity she pours into her craft. For the first time in my wedding planning journey, I didn’t feel alone or overwhelmed. Not only was she consistently communicating with us, but she also kept in regular contact with all of our vendors throughout the entire process. (Side note: even though she’s technically a day-of coordinator, Ana begins working with you two months before your wedding date, so it truly felt like we had a full-time wedding planner.) Thanks to her, everyone knew exactly what they needed to do, when to do it, and how. She even created a master timeline that was shared with us, our wedding party, the venue director, and all of our vendors. This ensured that everything ran smoothly and that everyone was on the same page. Hiring Ana was a huge weight lifted off our shoulders. Learning about her own wedding story became a driving force behind her work. She takes the difficult parts of her personal experience and turns them into a promise—that her couples will never feel that way. Her passion is evident not only in the love and care she pours into every couple, but also in the breathtaking final product. From décor to design, she brings each couple’s vision to life with beauty, intention, and grace. You can truly see that her heart is in every detail. When I saw everything come together for the first time in person, I was in awe. It was exactly as I had imagined—only more beautiful. On the day of our wedding, Ana went above and beyond. She checked in on us constantly, made sure we ate and enjoyed our food, and carried a calm, peaceful presence that grounded us. Lastly, Ana will fight and vouch for her couples until the very end. We ran into a few issues, but she ensured that our vision was heard and never compromised. She is a lovely person inside and out, and we are truly honored to have worked with her. This won’t be the last time we do. She has become part of our love story, and she gave us an unforgettable experience. To us, Ana is now family.

Ana at Greene Signature Weddings was THE SINGLE BEST vendor I could have booked for my wedding! She is AMAZING at what she does! My wedding was in May 2025, and I hired Ana about ...

8 months before my wedding. There was so much to plan, and on top of that, my wedding was at a private residence so she truly coordinated everything. She made the experience as easy as it could possibly be and truly brought our vision to life! From the very first Zoom meeting, she established a trusting, professional, and friendly relationship with me and my husband. Our families and bridal party got to know her during the rehearsal dinner and the day of the wedding, and EVERYONE was raving about how amazing she was! She made sure everyone was on the same page. Her ability to instantly click with people of all ages, personalities, and backgrounds is amazing. Ana was so organized throughout the whole planning process. She uses an online portal that makes checklists, due dates, guest info, vendor details, and moodboards (everything really) centralized and easy to follow. With a little less than 8 months to plan, she found and helped me secure amazing vendors. She communicated with all the vendors and after every meeting, she clearly summarized all notes and to-do’s that made it so easy for me. She responded to all emails, texts, and calls promptly. She always checked in to make sure we were on the same page and that I was satisfied. On the day of the wedding, she completely relieved my husband and I of all stress. She even provided my maid of honor and sister with walkie talkies so that we were always in communication. A few issues arose the day of the wedding that were out of our control. She calmly handled all the issues seamlessly. We weren’t even aware of them until later! She truly made sure my husband and I enjoyed our day! Ana is truly Superwoman! After the wedding, she took care of issues that arose from the vendors from the day of (that were out of our control) and made sure I was compensated. I am sad I will not be working with Ana anymore, and we joke (but truly hope) that we will see her again when my sisters get married! I am 1000% satisfied with Greene Signature Weddings’s planning services. She deserves all the amazing reviews she receives and more. Brides, you can fully trust that Ana and her team will take care of you! <3

Ana was the wedding planner for our wedding, and she did such an incredible job! We originally tried to do our wedding without a wedding planner, but our vision was very ambitious,...

and it soon became clear that we needed some help. Once Ana joined the team the whole process went from stressful and uncertain to fun and possible (and still a little stressful of course, weddings are always a lot of work 😅). She listened to our ideas about having a fairytale theme, a drag brunch, and 10 distinct wedding cakes and instead of saying we should scale it back she said “I love it, let’s do it. What if we also…” She helped us figure out the steps to making our dream wedding happen while providing creative ideas and suggestions as to how to make it even more special. She was so attentive to the small details from making sure my immunocompromised mom had a safe isolated place to eat to bringing my baby brother toys and activities to keep him entertained during the ceremony. She was truly a pleasure to work with, and we genuinely feel we’ve gained a lifelong friend in the process. Thank you for everything Ana!!!

TLDR: Ana brought our modern fairytale wedding to life—saving us from a scam caterer, embracing our wild ideas, and handling every detail with heart, skill, and magic. Long: Whew… ...

where do I even start? My fiancé Nathan and I got engaged in 2023, and we had a clear vision from the beginning: A Modern Fairytale wedding. Think Bridgerton vibes (even though I haven’t seen it). We booked the venue first and were told we needed a “day-of coordinator.” Hiring a full planner wasn’t even on our radar—until the planning actually began. As we started dealing with rentals, catering, and a million tiny details—all while juggling full-time jobs—we realized we needed help. So, we started looking. We met a lot of planners, mostly through The Knot. Some were kind, but many left us feeling discouraged. More than one ended our intro call the moment they heard our budget, saying something like, “Let’s not waste each other’s time.” Ouch. Then we met Ana, and everything changed. Instead of shutting us down, Ana explained why planners might say that—and how our vision wasn’t impossible, but would need some thoughtful adjustments. She made us feel confident, not small. She treated our wedding not just as a job, but as something she genuinely believed in. Ana listened. She made smart suggestions. She told us where we’d need to compromise, and where we could push for magic. For example: we wanted to skip a traditional wedding photographer and have five of our college friends (who ran the photography club with us) volunteer to shoot the day in shifts (which made it more affordable) while I edit the photos myself. A lot of planners might’ve faltered and encouraged us to hire an experienced photographer instead. Ana embraced it, gave us a game plan, and made it feel exciting. Our wedding was full of unconventional ideas—ten cakes instead of one, a two-hour drag show, a theatrical set instead of a photo booth. Ana never made us feel like anything was out of the picture. Instead, she helped us dream bigger, while also guiding us toward what was doable. And then, there was the catering disaster. Before we met Ana, we signed with a caterer who seemed perfect. Great reviews, gorgeous kitchen, uniformed staff, and an unbeatable quote. But after we hired Ana, things unraveled fast. They missed deadlines. They ghosted us. They canceled walkthroughs—twice. When they finally showed up, they knew nothing about our wedding. Ana stepped in immediately. She took over communications, gathered evidence, helped us file a dispute with our bank, and spent hours researching their shady history. Turns out, their marketing photos were stolen, and the chef’s credentials didn’t add up. We realized we’d been scammed. Thanks to her, we got a full refund. But that’s not all—this was less than two months before our wedding. Ana still managed to introduce us to a new caterer, one she trusted and had worked with before. She helped us rework our menu, stayed within budget, and somehow made it all feel seamless. The food was amazing. It was like the first caterer never existed. Ana was our planner, yes—but she was also our advocate, our creative partner, and our fairy godmother. Because of her, our wedding stayed on track and true to our vision. She made the impossible feel effortless. If you’re lucky enough to have Ana in your corner, you’re in the best hands possible. She doesn’t just plan weddings—she makes dreams come true. We hope she gets to bring your own fairytales to life too.

The wedding of our dreams! A beautiful cultural Indian-Mexican celebration. Several of the attendees have stated that our wedding was the best wedding they have ever attended. Ana ...

made it all happen. Initially my husband and I thought we could handle the big task of planning our wedding. Boy… were we wrong. As time flew by, we became more and more nervous about the big day. We decided to call in a professional. We hired Ana about 5 months prior to our wedding date, found her via The Knot. I reached out to Ana and within the same week she responded and included an info sheet + prices of the services she provides. Ana’s prices are standard and very reasonable for the Bay area. We let her know our interest in hiring. The next step was a zoom call. Prior to call, she sent us a questionnaire to be discussed during the zoom call. We reviewed budget, venue and pending items needed. We purchased the Partial Wedding package, that included: Partial vendor selection, Planning Checklist, Wedding day timeline, Vendor & client meetings, Email & phone support and Day of coordination and management. Ana set up a lunch with us and we discussed the vision of our wedding. From our initial consultation and meeting with Ana, I knew we had found the perfect planner and made the right decision to hire her on. Ana is, personable, detailed orientated, knowledgeable, customer focused, organized, an active listener and kind. Anna is a “Do-er” in my line of work, we call her the Unicorn. She always made us feel good and happy about our big day. Wedding planning is no easy feat. Ana does it all with a smile. Ana is beyond knowledgeable; she is a true professional and provides good insights and guidance on negotiating with Vendors. Ana is beyond thoughtful. For our wedding day Ana provided the Groom and Bridal suite with a basket of goodies, things such as face blotting paper, tide pens, floss, breath fresheners, lip balm, deodorant and protein bars. This gesture blew me away. Ana also gifted the ring bearer and flower girls gift bags, the parents were so appreciative of this gesture. The day of the wedding day, she checked in regularly asking if I needed anything, kept us fed and on time. Ana took care of all – place cards, signage, guest book, small décor, and overall creative vision for our wedding. She sent me images she created on Canva. Truly above and beyond customer service. Our guest were floored by all details and beautiful representation of both cultures. Ana is organized and thorough; the timeline of wedding left no detail out. This helped with the flow of the wedding and making sure we/guest enjoyed every minute of it. The bridesmaids/groomsmen were very given a printed itinerary on day of rehearsal. This was so crucial to yielding off questions they could easily find answers for. She is anticipatory to your needs. Truly a top tier skill to have as a planner. Ana even surprised me (Bride) with floral decoration of a statement piece we rented. Its like she read my mind. A very special moment for me was my father telling me how special Ana made him feel. This blew me away. Ana made our dreams come true with her impeccable attention to detail and genuine personality. Our big day was perfect in every way and that is thanks to Ana and her team. Thank you for making us feel so special and supported. The Chowdhury's.

It's hard to express how wonderful Ana and team are. My husband and I agree that working with her was the best decision we made about our wedding. Ana made our wedding perfect. Hon...

estly, I wanted to plan/coordinate my wedding myself. I'm very organized and do a lot of project management for work. About 2 months out, things were going very well, but everyone I know who is recently married recommended we hire a coordinator. I didn't think I needed one. I was very wrong. There is so much I didn't know! From the start, Ana was a dream. Great communication, warm personality, and she put us at ease. After our first meeting, both my husband and I noted that it felt like we had met with an old friend. About a month out from our wedding. Things started to feel hectic with coordinating. If we didn't have Ana, I don't know how we would have managed. She completely took over (while ensuring our voice was heard through the process). At first, it was hard to relinquish control. But it was immediately apparent Ana understood our vision and had amazing style of her own. I appreciated her recommendations and input. It felt like working with a friend who had my best interests in mind, but also had better style and vision! Ana's ability to coordinate with all our vendors was such a game changer. It's hard to identify her biggest strength, but communication and relationship building are up there. Ana's charm and existing relationships with our vendors went a long way. She knows how to navigate this world. Since she was such a pleasure to work with, they often made exceptions that made our day even better. Like everyone told us, our wedding day went by too quickly. My stress was super low, mainly because of Ana. I'm not even aware of anything that went wrong because she took care of it. I am not exaggerating when I say that literally every person in our family and bridal party came to us at some point during the day to say how amazing Ana is. I had 6 crazy "on-top-of-things" bridesmaids who let me know how lucky we were to have Ana throughout the day. In the days since my wedding, I'm hearing more stories from the day. I can go on about how good Ana is at her job. But she truly went above-and-beyond. There were so many personal touches throughout our wedding. She made our wedding feel like "us". We included our 2-year-old nephew as our ring bearer. We knew he was a wildcard and it became apparent from the rehearsal that he was a bit overwhelmed. My brother and sister-in-law told me after the wedding that Ana had put together a care package for him with his name. It was so incredibly thoughtful. Just one example of the above-and-beyond. I could say so much more, but will end by giving you my word that Ana will make your wedding the best it can be. I cannot recommend her enough. My only regret is not hiring her earlier in the process.

opposite! I had a vision for my wedding that Ana captured perfectly. Not once did I have doubt that things weren’t going as planned. Ana was a joy to plan with. She was efficient, organized, communicative, and pleasant all the time. Collaborating with her on ideas for the wedding was such a joy! She shared our excitement every step of the way. One of the best things about Ana is that she was pretty much a one-stop-shop. Need silverware that matches your theme? She has it! Whatever candle, vase, statement piece you need she had it or she would go out of her way to procure it for us. In a nutshell, our wedding day was as perfect as I could’ve ever imagined. It would never have been that amazing if we didn’t have Agreeneandco on our team.
