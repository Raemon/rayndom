d reception in an HOUR LONG video filled with lifelong memories of all the important parts of the ceremony and reception in addition to us getting ready, family and all the smiles. They were there and didn't miss anything. They are both extremely easy to work with, price points very clear, affordable and worth every cent. I hired another photographer which was not necessary but they worked smoothly together, capturing all the memories I could ever hope for. I would hire them both again without a doubt.

ke a photo of the everyone who attended the wedding in one big group shot (which I really really wanted). My album is gorgeous too! But the thing I was most impressed with was my wedding video. The highlight video and long video of the whole day were so well done. The production value was amazing! I knew it would be good, but I was taken aback by how great it all turned out. I felt like the video was made by a Hollywood film company! Would definitely recommend.

My husband and I hired Andy to do both photo and video for our Chinese bridal party, wedding ceremony at San Francisco City Hall plus 2 outdoor SF locations, and Chinese dinner ban...

quet at Koi Palace in Daly City. On the bridal party day, he was very punctual and arrived at my mother-in-law’s home earlier than the planned meeting time. My husband and I met him for the first time that day and we immediately had a great first impression. He was very friendly and easy to work with. All of my family members complimented how hard working he was as he went around the house photographing every single detail. The house had lots of decorations and bridal food set up by my two mothers and he made sure to capture literally every inch. He was very respectful to all of my family when instructing everyone how to pose or organize in different areas of the home. I have a large family so there were many rotations of different groups for photos but he made it fun for everyone by offering suggestions for fun and candid poses. It made everyone feel more relaxed and less stiff. He really made us feel like we got all the shots we could possibly get. Everybody was happy and the event went smoothly. A week later, we got married at San Francisco City Hall. Andy and his partner arrived earlier than planned and got all of their equipment set up and ready so we would have all the entrances of us and our family captured before the ceremony. He captured our signing and the entire ceremony at the rotunda. He always made sure to get the best angles without people in the background and politely asked others to please move aside so we could get a great shot. Our ceremony was on a Friday, which is the busiest day at City Hall for marriages, so there were so tons of people everywhere. But Andy tried so hard for us and always found the open spots for our chance. After taking every possible shot at City Hall, we headed out for outdoor shoots in SF. First we went to Fort Point and took photos inside and around the Fort building. It was a very cold and windy day so Andy did his best to work fast and allow us time to warm up in between different shots. He was very considerate and always checked with us to make sure we were okay and could continue in the cold. We were able to walk to many different spots in the Fort for a nice variety of photos. Then we went to Palace of Fine Arts. He also had past experience here so he knew great places for us to sit or pose at. The following day was our dinner banquet at Koi Palace. Once again, Andy and his partner arrived earlier than the expected meeting time and got to work photographing all the details possible inside the restaurant. When people started to arrive and sign in, he made sure to capture candid moments as well as take the posed photos with every single group. He was so friendly to all of our guests and made everyone feel comfortable to take photos. The whole event went smoothly and we got everything we wanted captured. All of our photos turned out amazing and we got so many compliments from friends and family. He always knew how to make us feel relaxed and comfortable. It really boosted our confidence and helped us get amazing photos that we never knew were possible. He is truly a hard worker who is passionate about his job. We could not have asked for a better photographer and were so lucky to have found him. We highly recommend Andy and his team to anyone for their special day.

If you are looking for a wedding photographer- I highly recommend Andy for ANY and ALL photography needs! A five-star rating is well-deserved for the phenomenal service we've recei...

ved! Our wedding was at Crystal Springs Golf Course in Burlingame- it was a very intimate weekday wedding. Due to financial restraints and a pretty tight budget, we decided to book Andy for a two hour period. This time period would have limited us to having professional pictures during our ceremony, a few family portraits after, and some pictures of the two of us after the ceremony. It would have meant that we would not have any professional photos taken during our reception. However, Andy being such the great person he is- did not let that happen. His generosity blew us away- at the end of our "Bride and Groom" portraits, he offered to continue to take pictures of our reception! This act of kindness moved us both to tears! I highly recommend Andy for ANY and ALL photography needs! He is so professional yet extremely personable! Andy showed up early to our wedding in order to capture some pre-ceremony shots. We also received our wedding photos early- they are absolutely beautiful! His photography style is timeless. He goes over and beyond to capture beautiful and creative shots- photos that will truly capture the essence of such a beautiful day! He has an eye for photography- a definite calling and truly a gift! Andy's attention to detail, compassion, passion for photography and kind demeanor stands out! We are so thankful that we selected Andy to be our photographer for our Wedding- he honestly is the best! If you are looking for a photographer to capture your most cherished, precious moments and memories- Andy is the perfect person! From the bottom of our hearts, Andy we want to say thank you so much- all of your hard work is truly appreciated!

xibility and insistence that this was all about us is what impressed us the most. He was on time and the photo shoot itself was fun. He did additional work for us without complaining and made sure he covered everything artistically speaking rather than being rigid about time etc. We reciprocated by adjusting the final payment to reflect his hard work. As for the final product, we are very happy with the results and will recommend him with full enthusiasm.

I first met Andy in 2012 when he photographed my cousin Kristal and her husband, Steve's wedding. I was so impressed with his early arrival to the venue to capture the getting read...

y process and the ambiance. He further impressed when he would get on the ground so that he could capture the right shot at the right angle. When I got engaged to my now husband, I didn't have a second thought about our photographer and knew that I wanted Andy to capture the day. He was very thorough in the planning process so that when the wedding day arrived, things went very smoothly. He arrived early and got wonderful shots of the venue, wedding party, and guests as they were arriving. The quality of his photos, the candid shots, and the artistic use of lighting are all things that were expertly captured in our wedding photos. We are so grateful to have had Andy as our photographer and highly recommend him and his skills.

I first contacted Andy for my son’s civil service wedding in June 2017 at City Hall in San Francisco. My daughter-in law’s family was not able to come to the US due to cancer surg...

ery and other circumstances and her parents agreed to her getting married right away. After explaining the circumstances to Andy, he offered to turnaround the photos and the video quickly so that her Mother and Father could see and enjoy their daughter getting married. Andy went over and above what we contracted for and we couldn’t have been happier with the photos and videos. The second time we used Andy was for the same son’s marriage redo and reception at the Hotel Majestic in August, 2017. My daughter-in law’s family flew in from South Korea. The bride and groom were very specific and only wanted photos taken on-site along with family photos. Andy gladly accommodated their requests. Andy barely took a break during the wedding and reception. Again, we couldn’t have been happier with the photos and videos (short and long one). One of the things that touched my heart about Andy was his response to my niece’s son who is 9. He had been watching Andy intently all day long. As Andy was packing up he asked Andy if he would take pictures of his mom, dad, brother and new baby sister. Andy could have said my time’s up but said yes without hesitation. Along with being a great photographer, he is a wonderful and kind person who knows what family means. Would I use Andy again? Without hesitation the answer is yes. Andy provided excellent photography and videography services on both occasions. He is a very hard worker, shows up on time and is very professional. Andy understands lighting and finds the right location for pictures. On both occasions Andy captured the joy and love of my son’s wedding day perfectly.

By far one of the best vendors I had at my wedding! It was a 104 degrees the day of my wedding in Cloverdale, CA and that did not stop Andy Sandy Photo from getting the best shots!...

These guys are very professional and such a pleasure to work with. Definitely reccomended!

There are many great qualities that my husband and I valued about Andy and this team. First, they are extremely hardworking! You can tell that his team works well together b/c each...

person knew their role and took direction from Andy. Throughout the day, they communicated via their headsets which was extremely vital in getting pictures from different angles and distance. This was also helpful during the "getting-ready" part of the day as my husband and I were getting ready in separate locations. Andy is a great leader and he knows exactly what he wants from his team. Andy works hard to get the shots that he wants. He understands lighting and will find the right location for pictures. He barely took a break during our wedding day because he wanted to be available to get shots of us and our guests. Overall, Andy and his team are simply extremely kind people and it was great having them capture our special day. Andy was super responsive and accommodating to our needs. We were in regular contact during the months leading up to the wedding and it was easy to communicate with him our wedding schedule and any special requests we had (e.g., location of 1st look). We are super happy with our pictures and video. We would absolutely recommend Andy to other couples getting married!

lity of their service and their level of professionalism are truly the very highest - I cannot imagine how they could have been any better. Andy and his crew showed up early to the pre-wedding activities and let us know exactly what shots they intended to take. In the morning, Andy worked skillfully and assertively to get many memorable shots of the door games and preparations (the games are part of our Chinese wedding). During the wedding ceremony itself, Andy and his crew worked in the background and captured so many angles of the ceremony that they seemed to be in more places than were possible! There were brief moments of tears and emotion from us and our guests, and Andy photographed those as well. Andy suggested a big group photo before the start of the portrait session, and it turned out beautifully. Finally, Andy worked tirelessly through the reception, and took excellent photos of the toasts, dinner, our conversations with the guests, and the cake. Andy processed the photos from our portrait session (~400) so quickly that we were able to send prints to all of our guests in the thank-you cards. We ended up with nearly 2000 photos in all from a 9-hour day, and the photos were exactly according to our wishes; the colors, focus, and artistry were perfect, with only light post-processing so everything looked natural. In summary, Andy photographed our wedding perfectly and I would not hesitate to recommend him with the highest enthusiasm to any potential customer.

sional, humorous (always a plus), and most importantly, punctual. Our agreed upon service length was 1.5 hours but he ended up taking our pictures for almost 3 hours because there were a number of spontaneous shots we wanted to do (our theme was city chic so we were strolling around San Francisco). Fast forward a few days, we were extremely surprised to receive an email from Andy saying our photos were ready. We were not expecting to get them until a couple more weeks so once again, Andy has raised the bar!!! Not surprisingly, we are hiring Andy and his team to cover not only the photography but also the videography of our wedding. We are happy customers indeed :)

y and I’m so glad that I did. Andy quickly responded to my inquiry and we were ready to do the shoot by the following week!! While emailing him, I told him about our concerns about not receiving enough instructions or feedback while doing our last shoot and I felt that we lost some good photos due to it. The day of our shoot, he was already there before us and ready to shoot. He listened to my concerns and made sure to give us directions and suggestions on new poses to ensure that we got the best shots. A few weeks later, we received over 100 photos! We went from not having any options from our first shoot to not knowing which of the amazing 100 shots we were going to choose for our save the dates! Every photo was beautiful! We liked him so much that we decided to hire him for our wedding photography and cancel our last photographer! We cannot wait until May 2018!! I know our pictures are going to come out beautiful!! I highly recommend him as he's extremely professional, knows so much about photography, and very affordable! Don't make the same mistake I did! You won't regret it!

Ahead of the wedding, Andy is very good at making sure everything is prepared for the day of, as far as scheduling, shot lists, etc. This was very helpful given that you have to worry about several other things for a wedding. On the day of the wedding, Andy and his team were great. They knew how to keep the day moving to ensure all photos were captured with family, bridal party, etc. The final product was beautiful! We were more than satisfied with the quality of the photos and our video. Andy even personally delivered the wedding album to my work!

We had the honor of working with Andy and the staff of Andy Sandy Photo and Video and Makeup Home For Brides. We were impressed with our wedding photographs. Was much better than...

we expected. They did a great job at capturing the sights of our wedding day. On top of that, the slide show montage that was orchestrated was absolutely fabulous. Slide show montage displayed the essences of our special day in a very emotional collection. From the initial meeting with Andy, we were both excited to work with him. He was not only professional, but utterly easy to talk to. He listened intensely as we described what our wishes were. He assured us that he was the right person for the job and he was indeed. On the day of, he was punctual and had everything set up with time to spare. Andy and the staff were never in the way and did a great job blending in. There were times that I totally forgot that they were there. This was not an easy feat since we had five locations for our wedding: Bride's Place, Groom's Place, Andy Goldworthy's Wood Line, Chapel of Our Lady at the Presidio in San Francisco, and Tai Wu Restaurant in Millbrae. Andy delivered the finished product to us in the time frame that he had promised.

I found Andy Sandy Photo & Video on the knot and I am glad that I did. Andy Sandy really offer excellent photography and videography services. My (newly wedded) wife and I went ...

with Andy Sandy Photo and Video after going down to our short list. For our wedding, we were going to have quite a few relatives who were going to be unable to travel, so photography and videography was a very critical element for us. Hiring Andy for the photography and videography was one of the best decisions we made. Although we only discussed over the phone, we could tell that Andy was an excellent fit for our needs, especially as we had a hybrid catholic wedding ceremony with a traditionally-influenced Chinese wedding banquet. We could also tell from his sample photography that we really liked his style, especially some very striking candid shots. Andy is extremely reasonable and tries very hard to do his best. If you are looking at wedding photography and videography, look no further, Andy is your man.

Photos: The wedding photos are beautiful! Andy and his team captured every single moment that we wanted. My husband and I were very impressed by and appreciative for Andy’s energy and hard work ethic. It was a very windy day (our wedding was outdoors), and Andy did everything he could to capture the perfect photos. In order to receive the photos, however, my husband and I had to purchase a 1 TB dropbox for one month in order to view and download all of the photos. It would have been really nice if the photo service included an external hard drive, or something similar, that had all of the photos on it. Wedding Video: The wedding video is also great! Andy’s music selection suited the video very well, and he captured all of the most important moments from our wedding. However, the garter toss was not filmed clearly (the recording was tilted and focused on the floor), and he did not include the song that we requested. Also, some of the scenes had multiple cuts – so many that my husband and I even got a bit dizzy watching them! Photo Book: The wedding photo book is nice, but simple. My husband and I were able to select pictures that we wanted, and then Andy chose a subset of those to include in the book. Overall: Andy is passionate about what he does, very hard-working, and energetic. He is also very quick to respond to emails, which is very helpful when planning a wedding! All in all, my husband and I were very happy with Andy’s photo and video services, and we highly recommend them to anyone searching for a wedding photographer and videographer!!

elped immensely with planning for our Engagement Photos and Wedding day. Andy paid attention to our special requests for specific photos, seamlessly took the standard "wedding photos" of the bridesmaids and I & the groomsmen and my husband, and worked with us to coordinate the flow of our family photos in the church to get those done efficiently. Andy worked very well with all of our other vendors, and coordinated with our videographer and coordinator at the Church ahead of time to ensure the teams would work well together day of. Andy captured the joy and love of our wedding day (and engagement shoot) perfectly. He and his team work extremely hard, captured all of our moments without being intrusive on my husband and I, and he helped us plan out our day to be just what we wanted! Andy delivered all of our photos quickly after both the engagement shoot and wedding day! He sent a few preview photos right away which was so nice, and allows his clients to have access to all of the photos his team took! He does great work with unique color edits and fun photo angles, and we simply adore the photos. We recommend Andy and Home for Brides to anyone looking for a professional photographer with excellent quality. The memories we have because of Andy are simply perfect!

I'm sooo happy and grateful to have chosen Andy and his team as our wedding photographer AND wedding videographer! He worked with me at every step of the process (before and after...

the actual wedding) to ensure that I would end up with finished products that I really LOVED! He met with me beforehand to assess the venue, he was willing to add some of my desired shots to his shot list, and he added tons of awesome ideas that I wouldn't have thought of, like having my husband and I take some "couple portraits" after dinner... those ended up being some of my favorite shots! Andy ended up sending me more gorgeous photos than he had promised, worked with me on edits for our album, and did such a great job on our video that I cried. Planning the day with Andy ahead of time had me really think through the timeline, which resulted in a fantastically smooth and pleasurable experience on the day of the wedding. Investing in one of his higher-end packages made this the largest single budget item for our wedding, but now that I've seen all the love, expertise and work he put into the process and how gorgeous everything turned out, I feel like we got the deal of a lifetime! I can't recommend Andy highly enough!

One of the decisions I am glad I made for my wedding was to hire Andy as my photographer. He definitely went above and beyond what I thought a photographer would do for a client. ...

When I first emailed him and booked him for seven hours, he offered to give me a free hour because he didn't believe that 7 hours would be enough after discussing my wedding timeline with him. He is very quick to respond to emails and will answer any questions you have. He will also work with other vendors on your day to coordinate with them. On the day of, he came on time and he and his assistant started making my bed in the hotel room! I was astonished to say the least. Another thing he did that I thought was really sweet was that I was having my makeup done and mentioned to no one in particular that I was starving. Andy took it upon himself to grab a bagel I had brought and started tearing off bite-sized pieces and hand fed it to me! Talk about personalized service :) Aside from his professionalism and service, he is also a great photographer. There were so many beautiful photos he took of our wedding and for the majority of it, I didn't even realize he was even there. He is very incognito but will also let you know when he wants to capture the special moments. If you have any doubts, let me assure you that booking Andy will be one less headache you have to worry about for your wedding.

nd everything ran smoothly with taking the pictures. He gave us his expertise in how to stand or lean for the pictures without being aggressive of invasive. Because of this, I have beautiful poses and candid pictures of my day. Like they say, a picture is worth a thousand words and mine are exactly that. Thank you again Andy for being professional and wonderful.

It was a great pleasure to work with Andy. He definitely went above and beyond what was expected and I am glad that we went with Andy for our wedding photos. Initial Meeting: ...

Andy was very accommodating and drove to coffee shop that was convenient for me for our first meeting to go over the different package options. He came prepared with two suitcases full of some of his previous wedding photos (all of which were fantastically done). Andy listened carefully to what I wanted with the pictures and made helpful suggestions for things that I missed or didn’t think about. He asked follow-up questions which showed how he really wanted to capture exactly what I wanted. Following Email Correspondence: Andy was quick to clarify any muddy details from our first meeting through email. I never felt like I was left hanging when it came to communication with Andy. Wedding Day Photographs: We decided last minute to not have “first look” and “getting ready” pictures. Andy was very accommodating when we asked if we could shoot pictures before the wedding ceremony at a different location instead. We chose to take these pictures at our alma mater and Andy shot some amazing pictures there. His pictures captured the story of wedding day but also had some great artistic shots too. There was the perfect blend of photos that we could put into a picture book and that we could frame individually. Andy worked tirelessly throughout our wedding ceremony and wedding reception to capture the candid moments as well as the group shots. He even set up extra cameras at our reception to capture video just so that we could have that footage. I really appreciated how organized Andy was with the group pictures too. It could be pretty hectic trying to gather everybody together, but Andy was patient and helped guide those pictures along. Andy worked above and beyond what I expected and I think a picture that really captures his dedication was at the end of the night when guests were leaving. I saw Andy packing up his gear and finally getting a chance to eat. He went through the whole day taking photos and didn’t stop to eat because he wanted to dedicate his whole attention to capturing my wedding day. Now that deserves the highest possible rating! Post Processing Photos: I was told that it could take 2 or 3 months for a photographer to process all of the photos after the event. So I was pleasantly surprised when Andy sent us a link to the storyboard of our wedding day 3 or 4 weeks later. About a week later, a hard drive with our wedding photos arrived. I have no doubt that we got these photos back so quickly because Andy made it an effort to get them to us quickly. Andy even included the RAW picture formats for me in case I wanted to edit them a different way later down the line. He included all of these for no extra charge and I really appreciate him going this extra mile. Needless to say, the photos were amazing. They captured the day perfectly! Overall: Andy went above and beyond and worked tirelessly to capture our wedding day. He had a quick turnaround time when processing our photos and did an amazing job with the post processing. All this for a fantastic rate! I would recommend Andy for any photography needs in the future!

If you're looking for a photographer that is willing to listen to your vision of what your wedding photos should look like, Andy Sandy Photography is the one. My husband and I orig...

inally went through a highly recommended photographer that was suppose to take spectacular pictures for our wedding day, but the photos did not come out the way we wanted at all. I was very upset and frustrated with the results and my videographer referred me to Andy Sandy Photography. He walked me through what he does as a wedding photographer and what he expects of himself at such event compared with the result of our photos. Andy took the time and guided me through what is expected in wedding photos and what he can do to help make our nightmare go away. He was kind enough to help us react our wedding day photos for our wedding party, family photos, and photos of just us. He scheduled two photoshoots for us: one of just us and the other with our wedding party and family. He took many photos with different angles, used different sceneries from our wedding photo site, used different cameras to get different focus, and worked non-stop for hours to help capture unbelievable moments. On our wedding day we only had maybe 5 photos taken of the two of us and Andy was able to help us retake photos that looked as it it was the day of our wedding. He took the photos from our first photographer and the pictures he took and created an album that looked as if everything was taken on the same day. We are very happy with the result of this vendor and would recommend anyone who is looking for a quick responsive and tentative photographer. He listened to what we wanted and was very patient with us. I'm sure every girl has a "good side" in photos and Andy was able to see that on his own before I even said anything. He made sure I stood on a certain side or way and made sure my hair, veil and make up was set for every pose. Andy Sandy Photography turned our magical day's nightmare into a fairy tale.

We recently had our engagement photos done by Andy. We found him on yelp after reading all the great reviews, and so glad we decided to go with him. His prices are very reasonable,...

he responds so quickly to email and phone call (same day- a lot of times within minutes), he was very organized, a lot of fun to work with, and most importantly, his photos are fabulous. It was so smooth working with him. We got a sneak peak of some of the photos he took during our engagement shoot and they looked great, the lighting and angles were perfect and he got great shots during sunset which is what we wanted. I also like how he took his time and did not rush us. What was amazing is that he had our photos done within days. I'm really pleased with his professionalism and his work. Would hire him again.

gement session. Before our wedding, we sent him a long shot list and Andy was very patient and efficient and was able to finish all those specific shots we requested. He even got a 2nd photographer for us on part of the wedding day to make sure they didn't miss any special moments. The videographers were also very nice and professional and came early to start shooting. The team worked really hard during our wedding day (it was a long 12 hr day and they made sure they documented all the important moments). Andy gave us all the pics much sooner than expected. Very very happy with how the pics and HL video turned out. We are soooooo happy that we picked Andy Sandy for our pics and video. VERY VERY PROFESSIONAL AND GREAT COMMUNICATION. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!

a 12+ hour shooting on the wedding day. Andy is as dedicated as they come and I am grateful for his patience and expertise. He is always punctual, if not earlier, and has good communication to ensure you are well planned for your big day. You can rely on him for recommendations and ideas. He takes pride in his work and doesn't mind going through great length to capture that "perfect shot". The outcome of your photos will speak for themselves.

photographers and Andy was the only one that did not sound bothered, every other photographer I spoke with made it seem like I was a bother or not worth their time for just an engagement. Andy's desire to capture the perfect moments and attention to detail helped me to not worry about a deposit, especially when he scouted the location for me, had a well written contract, and we got all the small details figured out. I proposed at Point Reyes, which is a bit of a drive for Andy too. My experience with Andy was nothing short of phenomenal. He was able to capture the full proposal and then we had a two hour photo shoot. Andy got so many great pictures in that short time frame. He moved around the park a bit and got lots of great backgrounds and he used the environment around us to craft perfect pictures. He even impressed me with how much he cared about the photos he took. He has multiple memory cards and a portable backup hard drive the cards saved to so he had 3 copies of our sessions photos. I can not recommend Andy enough; fun guy, cares about his customers, responds quickly to email, and best of all he genuinely wants you to be happy.

Having Andy do our engagement session is San Francisco and Napa was one of the best decisions I've made for our wedding! We flew in from Houston for a mini vacation and figured it ...

would be a great opportunity to get our engagement pics taken there. Upon doing extensive research, I ran across Andy's website which included so much information that led me to feel comfortable enough to reach out to him. He made communicating super easy as he was always responsive with his emails and was super flexible with what we were looking for. He was straight to the point and answered any and every questions I had. I felt really bad when our flight was delayed which pushed us back with meeting with Andy but he was super understanding. That right there was a good sign as to how nice he is! We started our session at Baker Beach where we discovered how funny and easy going Andy is! By all means, my fiancé and I were not ever meant to be models but Andy definitely made things easier for us. Andy is so passionate with his work and continuously aimed for the best shots during each scene. He showed us certain shots that he liked right after he caught them and I was absolutely stunned. I've worked with some other photographers before and they were generally strict about the amount of hours booked but Andy was different. He did not for one second, rush us to finish, instead, he even went over the time we booked to ensure we had the right shots. We thought that was so nice and generous of him, which was another reason why we are so glad we went with him. The following day, we met in Napa and of course, Andy was there early and ready to go. He was super patient with us as my fiancé began to get a little discouraged due to the heat but Andy continued on with a smile. He would consult with me and ask if I liked certain shots and if I replied "no", he would continue to recapture that moment to where I would like it. He was also honest when he said he didn't like certain angles/poses and explained to us why so we can keep trying to get the right one. From beginning to end, Andy made our experience nothing short of awesome. He managed to edit a few photos the same day to give us a little sneak peak and I was pleased as is so I can't wait to see the rest of the photos! Thank you Andy!

m the very first email. He responded in a day & answered all my questions. I had so many questions but he was patient. We set up a contract & it was a breeze everything was laid out in the contract with no surprises. Days before the wedding he contacted us to confirm & the day of the wedding sent a text that he was at city hall 40 minutes early to set up. What a true professional! It was our first time at city hall & we were completely lost but Andy took charge & not only was he our awesome photographer but a lil bit of our event coordinator. He totally guided not only my husband & I but our family. My family was so impressed how he took charge. We even nicknamed him mr. awesome. He not only stayed way past his time to shoot family pictures but came back after he left to take a shot of our rings. Great service! Having a professional photographer was the best decision we made. He was worth every penny & to be honest after the wedding we felt like we owed him more than what we paid because he was working his butt off to get as many pictures he can get within the 2 hours. Amazing! Andy was very easy going and my husband & I felt comfortable right away. The pictures ended up being gorgeous! He totally knows how to work san franciso's city hall & it's beauty! We get tons of compliments on the quality of the pictures. I never take the time to write long reviews but Andy truly deserves one.

We hired Home For Brides for wedding photography and wedding videography for our big day. To say they were fantastic, would be an understatement. Email communication pertaining to ...

and prior to the event, was very quick and concise. They answered all of our questions and accommodated any changes or add-ons we wanted to our package. They day of the wedding, Andy and his team showed up on time and ready to work. They were a very impressive bunch. Every member of the crew dressed all in black, each with a tool belt full of different cameras and gadgets. They bobbed and weaved through the action and gorgeously caught some truly incredible moments. They did a fantastic job keeping our unruly bunch of Alaskans corralled for photos and video. The guys were an absolute blast to be around and honestly fit right in with everyone at the wedding. (Wedding tip: feed these guys a good meal, they work their butts off and totally deserve it!) The product we received was TOP NOTCH. Our wedding music video is absolutely stunning, and is by far our new most prized possession. The photos they caught...wow! So so many photos, each better than the last. And the full length video allowed us to catch all of the action we missed, and will help us relive our special day forever. If you are reading this review searching for the people you want to be in charge of capturing the memories of your event, wedding, graduation, or ANYTHING; I'll save you some time. Hire these guys! They are absolutely phenomenal. Joel and Jeannie Napa Valley 10-18-2014

We recently gotten married on December 27, 2014. It was sometimes in July when I was searching for a photographer for my wedding. I stumbled across the reviews I've read on Yelp ...

on Andy Sandy Photo and figured I'll inquire on his package to see what he can do for us. Andy was one of my best vendors that I have chosen for my wedding. He was very professional and punctual in regards to our schedule itinerary. I am truly grateful for the accommodations/suggestions that Andy have made for us. I would highly recommend Andy for any of your photography needs, for all occasions!

r photos I wanted (I just emailed him a file of the photos I had seen on Pinterest/other websites that I wanted at my wedding). In addition, he was willing to TRAVEL to my wedding venue without raising the cost of my purchase by much (only $80 charge for hotel for overnight). I got married in Redding, CA, which is not exactly close to SF/Bay Area. When the weekend of our wedding arrived, Andy emailed me saying he was going to bring an extra photographer, no charge to me, but just to help make sure he got the quality/number of photos he wanted. I was so pleased by this bonus! It was so thoughtful of him to include. The whole wedding day, we got all the photos we wanted. It was over 100 degrees that day, so I know both photographers were sweating just as much as we were. They worked incredibly hard to make all our dreams come true. The photos took about 2-2 1/2 months to get back to us. We didn't ask for any books or specialty prints, just touched-up digital files. He sent us files on both DVD and on the card from the camera. This made sure that we had them in multiple places, and that we wouldn't loose them. In addition, he created an online album for us to view photos while we were waiting for the "real" ones to get to us, and posted some on Facebook for friends/family to see as well. In total, he ended up providing us with over 1,000 images from our wedding day. Here is what we had on our contract: Wedding photographer from 2pm-9pm (wedding ceremony started at 4) 1 photographer (he brought an extra) Digital touched-up image files It was a simple contract and a simple decision. You won't be disappointed with his work!

s, he even included a second photographer at no additional cost! He and his assistant showed up on time or early. We ended up with over 1,600 photos and plenty of fantastic shots for print. He was a little hasty getting everyone organized, as you have to be, in order to get us all the shots we'd want/need. Make sure you allow an hour of extra time after you're done with hair/makeup to take prep photos!

I made for the wedding. I came across his videography company after searching high and low over the internet and I was so thrilled about his reasonable pricing after viewing his amazing work online. Communication with Andy during the whole planning phase was so easy. He was professional, prompt and on top of the game. I was extremely impressed with how responsive he was with all my emails and phone calls. It seemed I always received answers within a few hours. Everything went perfect on the day of. Andy and his team's professionalism and dedication really shone through. The final products were absolutely amazing and exceeded my expectations in every way.

He was extremely organized and was on time and was very detailed oriented. He and his team did an exceptional job on everything. The photographs were truly amazing and exceeded my expectations.

We had an excellent experience with Andy as our wedding photographer and can’t recommend him enough. Not only is he a fantastic photographer but he’s also wonderful to work with. ...

He did both our wedding (12 people outside at the beach) and our reception 4 months later (150 people indoors at the Regency in San Francisco) and for both events he did an outstanding job. We LOVE our pictures! Andy is the utmost professional: First thing you should know about him is he answers every email almost instantaneously, at any hour of the day or night (‘til 11pm or so). In probably 2 months total of emailing him I never had to wait longer than 30 minutes for a response. For stressed out brides that’s a great asset!! Before the wedding we Skyped with him as we had some questions and wanted to get to know him a little, and right away we could tell how professional and yet easy-going he was. For our wedding he was willing to make an exception to his usual time minimum and let us hire him for 1 hour only (we knew our ceremony was only going to be 15 min, and with only 10 guests how many pictures can you take, really). In fact he got there an hour early (same for our reception) to scope out the place and figure out what lighting etc he needed, and ended up shooting pictures for 90 min instead of 60. He didn’t charge us any extra and ended up sending us over 250 pictures for that hour and a half. Awesome!! For the reception he got there early enough to take several pictures of the room set-up before the guests arrived, which is something I didn’t even think about but I’m so glad he did. He did an amazing job of getting a picture of every single guest in attendance, solo shots and in groups, formal and informal, etc. A friend of mine who’d recently hired a professional photographer for her daughter’s bat mitzvah was so impressed with Andy, because unlike her photographer, “everywhere she looked, Andy was.” He sent us over 500 pictures for our 4-hour event. Do yourself a favor and hire Andy as your wedding photographer. His prices are a bargain, he’ll provide you with amazing pictures, and he’ll be completely pleasant and friendly about it the whole time! :)
