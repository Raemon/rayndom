Nelly's was the second bridal store I decided to visit after my friend had recommended it to me. I'm so glad she did since I was able to find my wedding dress at Nelly's! There wer...

e two dressing rooms (areas enclosed with curtains). My four bridesmaids were able to join me and had seats in front of the mirror and podium. Their customer service was top notch and had a wide variety of selections. They were super helpful with pulling dresses for me, giving me their opinions, and just really catering to me. I not only found my beautiful wedding gown here, but also received a wonderful experience. The previous bridal boutique I had visited didn't have as much of a selection within my price range, but Nelly's definitely did. They do not alter wedding dresses, but recommended me to a place that did an amazing job. I'm so happy I said yay to the dress here!

I had the best experience at Nelly's both trying on dresses and when I went back to pick out the "one" and get my first fitting. Trying on dresses is stressful but they made it s...

o much fun and personal. I also really like that I was able to buy local in my community as that's something that's important to me.

Nelly has a beautiful selection of gowns and they are reasonably priced. I definitely suggest looking here for your gown. I was so happy with mine.

I went to Nelly's for a bridesmaid dress for my best friend's wedding last year. When it came time for me to search for my own wedding dress, I decided to look there after going to...

horribly overpriced and snooty shops in downtown San Francisco. When I walked in, both Nelly and Leticia remembered everything about my husband and me, a trip we had taken, and our jobs. They were genuinely excited for me to be engaged, as they had met my now husband when he was only my boyfriend. I told them what styles I was interested in and my dress budget, and they pulled dresses that fit those criteria plus some others that they thought would look good on me. I loved two that Leticia picked out that were nothing I would have tried on otherwise. By the end of the day, I had decided to buy one of them and end my search (a Pronovias that Nelly had just gotten in). On my wedding day, I got more compliments than I could have imagined.
