Working with Gianna at Floral Luxe was wonderful. My husband and I had a clear vision for what we wanted our wedding to look like, but no clue how to describe it. Gianna heard us a...

nd brought our vision to life. She was flexible with small changes as we got closer to the big day and we couldn't be happier with how everything turned out.

Gianna was the first florist I spoke with. I immediately loved her personality and ability to share my vision. On our initial call we talked a little bit about wedding and a little...

bit about life, and a lot about flowers. Gianna kept my dreams appropriately in check (I had no idea Lily of the Valley was all the rage, and cost reflected such). Gianna was conscientious and understanding of our budget. I still had spoken to a few other florists after speaking with Gianna, both traditional flower shops who do wedding florals and wedding florists. Gianna’s proposal came in slightly over the discussed budget, but I still really wanted to work with her. After explaining to her that I felt that way, she spent an additional hour with me on the phone to reach a happy middle ground so we could work together. Gianna had written us a couple of proposals as our needs changed throughout the wedding planning process. On the day of the wedding everything was STUNNING. The chuppah was exactly how we discussed it and what I had envisioned. I got so many compliments on the flowers from guests, how beautiful they were, how fresh, and that they smelled amazing. The flowers were perfect for our perfect day!

Just incredible! Florals for a wedding are a bit nerve-wracking because you don't really get to see what's going to transpire on the day of, but man oh man does Christina's team de...

liver! I knew the work was amazing based on Instagram, but I also obviously wanted my twist on things I had seen previously done! I spoke with Gianna about all of my requests including installations for a champagne wall, greenery and candles for dinner tables, and nuanced details for my bridal bouquet. I believe Gianna's attention to details and asking questions along the way to ensure my vision was brought to life set Christina up for success to create exactly what I imagined! I was STUNNED day of by everything and honestly had no feedback to provide. Everything was perfect and I highly recommend.

We asked for moody, jewel tone flowers and Floral Luxe delivered! Our flowers were so cool and unique. We loved them and so did our guests!

Wasn’t emotional all day until the flowers started coming. The amount of detail and beautiful that Christina did was beyond amazing and I will recommend her always!!

Christina is amazing. She has such a wonderful heart and her floral arrangements are incredible. As a COVID bride, we had to completely pivot how our wedding looked. We went from a...

200 person wedding to a small intimate ceremony with family in my aunt's backyard. My husband and I believe that investing in photography and florals are the most important, so even though we had a small wedding, we wanted breathtaking florals. Christina went above and beyond to make our day special with a bouquet, a boutonniere, aisle florals, arrangements for pedestals and an amazing arrangement for our arch. She took my aunt's backyard and turned it into a venue and made our day so special. Her florals aren't the main reason we work with her, it's her heart for others. She is always putting her couples first and making sure every thing is perfect for their day. During COVID, it was heartbreaking to decide to move our reception to 2021 to safely celebrate, but she was supportive throughout the process and encouraged us to follow our heart. Christina is not a vendor to my husband and I, but a friend. We look forward to see what our florals look like next year, because I can't imagine how she'll one up what she did for us this year.
