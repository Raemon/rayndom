My experience with Peacock Gap was nothing short of exceptional. When I found the venue in January 2023, I knew it was the one. From the beginning, our coordinator was transparent,...

easily reachable, and accommodating. However, when she departed Peacock Gap, I became nervous. It wasn't until Stacey immediately reached out and assisted me right away. I had many walk-throughs at the venue before the wedding date and each time Stacey helped us bring our vision to life by offering many suggestions and new recommendations that we had not thought of. She was very responsive and attentive to our questions and numerous changes. We did hire an external wedding planner/coordinator to help assist with our event, but the staff on-site for both the rehearsal and wedding, were just as helpful to not only our guests but the wedding party. The food was AMAZING! I have not stopped receiving compliments for the fabulous food. We chose the Flat Iron Steak, Lemon Dijon Halibut, and the Gnocchi. Everything was perfectly cooked and served in a timely manner. I would like to point out that the Executive Chef, John, even reached out to me before the event to inform me he was going to elevate our dishes further with more seasonal garnishes. The attention to detail of the entire team at Peacock Gap has made this such an easy process for me. They brought to life my vision and then some with their fantastic recommendations and suggestions. You will be in great hands with this venue and team!

(I posted this on Yelp, but I wanted to post here as well so any future married couples are well informed). The Clubhouse at Peacock Gap hosted our wedding ceremony and reception ...

in November 2022. I now feel distanced enough from the date to provide a fair evaluation. Firstly, the wedding itself was beautiful thanks to our external wedding planners, the venues we found, my sister and family who helped coordinate a lot of things, all our friends and family who could attend, and my husband. However, the events leading up to the wedding were a mess. Our wedding coordinator from The Clubhouse at Peacock Gap changed at least 3 times. They took weeks, sometimes months to reply to an email, and often failed to answer our basic questions and follow up on things I had asked about a while back. I had asked for a tasting, and if that wasn't possible, at least a chat with the chef about what menu to pick. They didn't even manage to schedule a phone call with the chef despite my following up multiple times. We ended up choosing the Italian buffet menu, which didn't have enough food with our guests, and let me say, my guest list was largely Asian people with small appetites. Furthermore, the menu we had been shown from didn't even match what was served. I attached a screenshot of the menu we had been presented. We did not get garlic braised chicories and white beans nor did we get a roasted root vegetable ratatouille. Instead, plain, steamed vegetables were served. During the wedding preparation, someone also barged into Coordination overall with this venue was a mess and left my husband and me stressed to the very last minute. I am thankful we at least had our wonderful wedding planners from an external vendor to help.

We had our wedding reception at Peacock Gap last weekend and I couldn't have asked for a more perfect venue! Moira and her team were amazing to work with and I cant recommend them ...

highly enough. We rented all 3 sections of the clubhouse for our 250+ guest event and it was comfortable, spacious, and beautiful! Guests raved over the food (especially the salmon entree and lamb lollipop appetizer), said the bartenders were top notch, and loved taking pictures on the patio during cocktail hour. Also, it was wonderful having our own getting ready suites for taking breaks throughout the evening. Overall, we had the best time at our wedding at Peacock Gap and I would recommend them to anyone!

What an Amazing Venue!! We could not have been happier on how our wedding turned out. From the start, communication with the event director(s) were timely. There was a change in th...

e event director in the beginning, which caused some anxiety, but it went smoothly and without incident. The grounds were pristine and I liked how the clubhouse was set apart from the main golf course. I worked predominantly with Tricia, who was fabulous and super helpful throughout the whole process. The day of the wedding, everything went smoothly and the food had rave reviews by my guests. Stephen, the banquet manager, was also excellent during the planning process. The day of the wedding he went truly above and beyond with whatever we needed. Words cannot express how truly grateful we were for making our special day so memorable and perfect.
