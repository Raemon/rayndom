bly dreamed of. He was flexible with our schedule, provided location recommendations, delivered the photos promptly, and best of all was such joy to spend the day with. Weddings are generally chaotic and stressful but Dave was the most wonderful partner to work with. There wasn’t a single moment where we questioned that Dave would deliver exactly what we’d imagined. If you’re looking for editorial, timeless, and candid photos that truly capture the moment, Dave is your guy. We could not recommend him enough!

Over the past 15 years, I’ve had the pleasure of working with Dave Medal as a photography assistant and second shooter at many events, and through that experience, I learned firsth...

and what it takes to be a successful professional photographer. His steady encouragement and mentorship played a meaningful role in helping me develop my own skills, and I’m proud to say I’ve now been able to make a living as a photographer for almost three years. When I got married last year, there was no one else I wanted to trust with capturing our day. Having worked alongside Dave at countless weddings, I knew he would bring a calm, thoughtful, and artistic presence, and that he would be able to photograph my wife and me as we see each other, and as we see our friends and family, in all the joy of the day. Whether it’s an intimate elopement or a 300-person celebration, Dave has a rare ability to make people feel seen and at ease, and to reflect the heart of the day back to you through his images. He shows you your wedding in a way you’ll be able to return to and share with loved ones for years to come. I recommend him wholeheartedly.

My husband and I aren’t the most comfortable in front of the camera, but Dave helped us relax and chatted with us the whole time. We had such a great experience! On wedding day, he was prompt and attentive, and our guests had great things to say about their interactions with him. I honestly don’t know how he managed to get so many angles of our ceremony. He was everywhere, all night long! We’re so glad we chose Dave!

Dave was introduced to us from a friend whose wedding he shot. We worked with him to shoot our wedding photos around a few locations in the city. First of all his work is amazing...

. His images are beautiful and artistic. He truly has an eye for such lovely moments and interesting lighting. We didn’t have exact locations picked out, but rather a couple areas of the city to shoot in. We walked around and found serendipitous back drops and scenes. The result was editorial style photography. We LOVE our photos! In addition to being a talented photographer, he is such a pleasure to work with. He is relaxed and flexible. I would consider myself shy and awkward in front of the camera but the shoot felt like we were hanging out with a close friend. My husband and I laughed the entire time and had a bunch of fun. After the shoot, he was very communicative and on time with turning around the edited photos. I know Dave does family photo shoot sessions as well. I’m definitely going to reach out to him when we ready for one.

Dave came recommended to us through our wedding coordinator Lillian Phan, and from the moment we exchanged emails with him- we know he was going to be fantastic. He was responsive...

, polite, fully answered all of our questions and made us feel comfortable right from the beginning. When we met with Dave for the first time, it was a feeling of this is someone whose known us for a long time. There was lots of laughter, ease and communication about what exactly we were looking for our wedding photographer. We knew we wanted someone with a more photo journalist aesthetic, and that’s exactly what we got. From that first meeting to the day of our wedding Dave was available via phone and email, and even met us right before the wedding to talk last minute details. He was fully versed on the timeline and all requests we wanted before the big day. The day of the wedding was the less stressful day ever working with Dave. He arrived in my room to take photos of me getting ready and my bridal party finishing up. He took amazing photos of all of our dresses, heirlooms- and made his presence quietly known. My husband had the same experience getting ready in his room. For a man that didn’t want a camera crew following him around the day he was getting married, Dave made him feel incredibly comfortable. We travelled from our hotel to the venue for me to get into my dress, first looks and family photos before the ceremony. Dave and his team were efficient, kind and captured the most heartfelt and beautiful photos of these moments. He was simply REMARKABLE. During our ceremony Dave was not “front and center” a request we had made but also his preference. He captured so much emotion, beauty and thought of our ceremony but allowed those photos to be captured from afar. This was the main sentiment from our guests throughout the evening as well. They knew we had a a photographer, but they never felt like he was in the way, or such a focal point. He captured everything amazingly and made us feel so so happy with the results. Dave is by the far the best photographer we have ever worked with. As we move through the next stages of our life, I know that we will call on Dave for more family photos/life moments. He is such a wonderfully warm, generous, talented, thoughtful guy, and we feel incredibly lucky to know him. To work with Dave is to get a gem of a human. Thank you for everything. We can not recommend him enough!

What you can’t tell by looking at his images is how wonderful it is to spend time with him. Your photographer ends up being one of the people with you through your whole event and Dave is someone you want to be around. He manages the group really well for family photos, he is kind and supportive and completely unobtrusive. He also has creative ideas that rethink portraiture and traditional wedding photography and knows exactly when the light is just right for the perfect moment. Can’t say how happy we were. We love Dave!

summate professional, an upbeat person who radiates positive energy. He was a real pleasure to work with throughout the entire wedding planning process. In a sea of professional photographers, however, what makes Dave really stand out, and the reason we felt like we won the lottery in securing his availability, is that Dave is a true artist. His understanding of light is masterful. And beyond all the technical elements of composition, Dave was able to beautifully capture on film all of the raw emotion of the day, everything that made our wedding special. I couldn't ask for a better record of the best day of my life.

Dave was simply awesome, and a pleasure to work with! From when we first spoke on the phone to having him photograph our wedding, we were completely at ease. I felt confident that ...

Dave would take beautiful photos, and be someone I wanted to be around on our wedding day, he’s just a happy guy and very personable...it felt like having a friend there with us! One of the best things about working with Dave is his personality. He has both a calming demeanor and yet is also professional, making sure the day ran smoothly and he captured incredible photos. He did a great job of providing guidance or suggesting shots to take, while also listening to what we wanted him to capture on the day. At one point we were considering taking a photo post-ceremony of the entire wedding (which was in a small space). I appreciated that Dave was totally on-board with making it happen if we wanted, yet he was also realistic with us about the logistics of it and outcome of the resulting photo (lots of little heads crowded together ha). It was evident that it was important to him that we were really happy and that we could actually enjoy our wedding day. During the ceremony and reception, he was completely a non-factor, which I mean in the best way...I knew he was there capturing everything but I never felt there was a paparazzi or felt distracted...yet somehow he was snapping away! His photos are incredible. He’s very talented and has an ability to capture the essence of a moment--his photography feel both intimate and special, yet authentic and not posed or fake. We couldn’t be happier having Dave as our wedding photographer. I’d highly recommend him to anyone - you won’t be disappointed!

Several times throughout the night I found myself pausing to admire how quickly and seamlessly Dave could change the lenses on his camera. When the photos finally came in, I was in love!
