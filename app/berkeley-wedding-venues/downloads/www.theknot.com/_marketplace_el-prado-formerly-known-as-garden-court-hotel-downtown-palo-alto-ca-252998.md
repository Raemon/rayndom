Highly recommend el PRADO if you are looking for something intimate and charming for your wedding. We had our 90-person wedding ceremony, cocktail hour and reception all on the sec...

ond floor (Terraza Ballroom, solarium and hotel lounge), and it was a decent size for our number of guests. The hotel staff was professional and courteous, and the food was great as well. A special shoutout to Sherry for going above and beyond in helping us throughout the planning process and being flexible with last minute changes!

el PRADO absolutely exceeded our expectations! So many of our guests (family AND friends) told us el PRADO was beautiful. Our moms specifically were wow'd by the opening of the b...

allroom at the end of the cocktail hour, and our foodie relatives loved the food! (which means a lot as they can be very... critical). Sherry took great care of us through all the planning, and both her and her staff were flawless and flexible in their day-of execution. We were able to fully immerse ourselves in the celebration with our guests, which means so much to us.

FIVE STARS in Every Aspect of a Wedding Venue! Our wedding reception at this venue was truly exceptional – better than we could have ever imagined. Highly recommend! The Team: It ...

all started with Jesse’s impeccable planning and coordination. His expertise and attention to detail were a huge relief, making the entire process seamless and stress-free. The Venue: El Prado’s courtyard and patio are simply stunning. With its large fireplace lit at night, beautiful Spanish-style balconies and string lights, the ambiance created a beautiful, global, and inclusive atmosphere that made the evening unforgettable. The Food: As many others have mentioned, the food was incredible – some of the best you can get at a wedding! The steak and salmon were fantastic, and the hors d'oeuvres, especially the lamb and twice-baked potatoes, were a big hit. We also used the second-floor lounge for an after-party, which was absolutely perfect. Accommodations: Having the venue as a hotel was the icing on the cake. Our family was able to stay together in the rooms, adding so much convenience and comfort to the celebration. Overall: Our experience was nothing short of amazing, and we couldn't have asked for more. Highly recommend for anyone looking to host an event here!

Jesse, the events director at el PRADO, is exceptionally diligent, responsive, organized, and kind! We are only at the early stages of wedding planning (we'll update this review la...

ter), but we wanted to write a review just to emphasize how meaningful it is to us to have someone like Jesse on our team. We've learned that the role of the events lead at one's wedding venue is critical from the very beginning – Jesse never made us feel rushed during our walk-through, sent a simple sample quote in a clean and easy to adjust Excel sheet so we could estimate costs quickly, compartmentalized the steps of venue planning so we could focus on what matters at the initial contract stage, and was flexible with us to ensure we had everything we needed.

t. If you are planning a wedding I highly recommend doing it here - not only is the food amazing (I was getting compliments all night), but the Terrace room is absolutely lovely and there are so many amazing perks with hosting a wedding here - among those complimentary stay in one of their lovely suites and also complimentary stay at one of the sister hotels in Spain for 5 nights. Everyone I interacted with from the Garden Court was so amazingly sweet and helpful and I received endless compliments on the venue and food.

If not the best, one of the best reception venues in the Bay Area! We had our wedding reception at the Garden Court Hotel on 12.31.16, and it was definitely a NYE that no one will ...

ever forget! First and foremost, this place is the definition of class. From the valet to the concierge to the event manager, Jesse, every single person you encounter is incredibly nice and respectful. The reception was beautiful, the banquet manager and staff were on top of everything and made sure every last detail was setup the way we had requested. We truly feel like this place was home for the 2 days we stayed here for the wedding. We had an expedited wedding plan in just under 6 months, and Jesse was the absolute best to work with. Incredibly flexible with his time, always was there for any question we had and more importantly was just a great person overall. The hotel rooms are beautiful. Our guests had about 38-40 rooms for NYE (out of 61). Every single person that stayed there had nothing but great things to say about their stay. Each room is slightly different and has its own little touch. Whether you are planning a wedding or just looking for a beautiful place to stay, we highly recommend the Garden Court Hotel for everyone! We will definitely be back!
