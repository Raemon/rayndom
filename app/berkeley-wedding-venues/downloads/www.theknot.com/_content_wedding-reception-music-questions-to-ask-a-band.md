## Printable Wedding Live Band Questions Checklist

If you're unsure of what questions to ask a band for a wedding, don't stress. Here's a helpful visual for you to use during the interview process––just print or save it to your phone. 

![Free, Printable Guide on Questions to Ask a Wedding Band](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/6c4370e3-6769-449a-87a2-a0d0e30acf4c~rs_768.h)

## Logistics Questions to Ask a Wedding Band

Before you can even talk about the wedding setlist, there are specific logistics-related details to sort out. Below are 14 questions to ask when hiring a wedding band during the initial contact stage.

### 1\. Are you available on our wedding date?




You might've already asked this question in your [wedding inquiry email](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-vendor-email-templates), but it doesn't hurt to double-check in person. The answer to this can help you move along with the other questions on our list.

### 2\. Do you bring backup equipment?




Most wedding bands prepare for an unexpected event like an amp blowing out. Although it's rare (and we hope it doesn't happen at your wedding), it doesn't hurt to be on the safe side by asking if they have extra equipment. 

FEATURED VIDEO FROM THE KNOT

### 3\. How much space do you need for yourself and your gear?




Every vendor you hire will need a certain amount of space to set up at your venue. Ask your potential band how much room they'll need so you can plan appropriately.

### 4\. Do you have any special requirements for your vendor meal?




Because they're on-site for most of your reception, you need to provide your wedding band with a [vendor meal](https://www.theknot.com/content/have-to-feed-wedding-vendors). Ask about each band member's allergies or dietary restrictions so they can get a tasty dinner like everyone else.

### 5\. What's your plan B for inclement weather for outside events?




Ask the band what's needed if your wedding will be outside and what [their plan B](https://www.theknot.com/content/outdoor-wedding-backup-plan) is if bad weather becomes an issue. "Any outdoor performance needs a cover. Sound equipment is expensive and can be damaged in sunlight or inclement weather," says [George Loreto](https://undercoverlive.com/), music expert and owner of [Undercover Live Entertainment](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/undercover-live-entertainment-costa-mesa-ca-571466), a team of professional musicians and MCs based in Orange County, California. 

### 6\. Will you have a soundcheck on the day of?




The band should do at least one soundcheck on the wedding day to ensure everything sounds like it should. Confirm when the band would like to soundcheck so your planner can add it to the schedule. 

### 7\. Do you require liability insurance?




[Wedding insurance](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-insurance-101) helps guarantee that you, your venue and your guests are protected in case of an accident. A true pro will offer to show you their certificate (and some wedding venues may even require a copy for their records).

### 8\. What's your cancellation policy?




Whether you change your date or your mind on the music, it's important to know the repercussions. Get a copy of this policy so you can reference it later. 

### 9\. How many breaks do you need throughout the evening?




It's helpful to know how many breaks your band will need and how long they'll last. What'll happen during those breaks is something to inquire about too. Will the band play approved filler music, have one musician step away while the others continue or will you need to plan [wedding games](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-games)? 

### 10\. What time will you arrive at the venue?




Another coordinating question to ask your band is their arrival time. Some venues have rules about when they allow vendors to start setting up. Ask what they need, then tell your venue and wedding planner.

### Get your party started

Find every kind of expert from DJs to musicians and more

### 11\. Do you perform at more than one event a day?




If your music entertainers don't have another event after your wedding, you've hit the jackpot. But if they have one before, ask what'll happen if the other event runs over and what they do to avoid that scenario.

### 12\. What is the deposit, and when is it due?




Don't be afraid to ask this question before leaving the first consultation. This will help you and your partner know how much money to budget and how much time you have to do it. 

### 13\. What will you wear to our wedding?




A potential band will usually have several attire choices for you to pick from. Tell them your [wedding dress code](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-website-dress-code) (if you have one) so they can know whether they should wear tuxedos and gowns or simple coordinated outfits, like black shirts and slacks.

### 14\. Do we need to rent instruments or equipment for your performance?




Find out exactly what equipment the band needs to perform so you know what you need to rent or borrow from the venue, like chairs or tables. If it's the band's first time performing at your venue, ask if they're willing to check out the space or connect with the venue's staff to confirm if they'll need extra equipment.

## Background and Experience Questions to Ask a Wedding Band

Don't make an avoidable [wedding music mistake](https://www.theknot.com/content/top-9-wedding-music-mistakes) by missing one of these questions. Here's what you should always ask a potential band when you meet them. 

### 15\. How long have you been playing at weddings?




This helps you determine how experienced the wedding band is. It's vital to know how long they've been performing at weddings, but you need to inquire about how often. Both are key to understanding how well they can handle your dance floor.

### 16\. Can we watch you perform before our wedding?




Seeing your potential band perform will give you a taste of what your wedding entertainment will sound and feel like. Luckily, plenty of bands host frequent public showcases or can share videos of their recent performances. "We encourage our clients to get to know a potential band before the wedding day," explains [Kurt Titchenell](https://www.bvtlive.com/), experienced musician and founder of [BVTLive!](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/bvtlive-bands-chadds-ford-pa-751692), a group of wedding bands and DJs in Philadelphia. "For example, every two weeks, our bands perform at venues, and couples can come and see them live and meet the band leaders."

### 17\. Have you ever worked at our venue before?




Wedding bands that are familiar with your venue space are a big plus. This means they'll know the best spots for acoustics, where to put their equipment, understand the venue's rules and more.

### 18\. Can you send us a list of reviews from your other clients?




This is one of the most important questions to ask when vetting a band for a wedding. Through reviews from _real_ couples (which you can find on [The Knot Vendor Marketplace](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/live-wedding-bands)), you can get an idea of how professional the musicians are, how many people liked their music style and if they brought the right energy to the event.

### 19\. How many people are in the band?




In your interview process, ask if the band ever makes member substitutes and how often, since this may indicate their style as a unit. "A band that performs more often together will inherently be tighter musically as opposed to a band that substitutes musicians regularly," Titchenell explains. "We recommend that couples consider this when looking for pros."

### 20\. Are there different options for how many musicians we can hire?




You might only have a small area available at the venue for your live band. If that's the case, a 10-piece brass ensemble probably isn't the best choice. See what options you have for your potential band and ask if the number of musicians can be adjusted accordingly. 

### 21\. What makes you different from other live wedding bands?




Put your potential vendor in the spotlight. See if the band members talk passionately about the work they do. The more energetic they seem about the topic, the more likely they are to give an amazing performance and you'll leave your wedding happy.

## Budget and Packages Questions to Ask a Wedding Band

Let's be honest. The [cost of a wedding band or DJ](https://www.theknot.com/content/average-cost-wedding-band-dj) is a big determining factor when deciding who to book. Take your time going through each question below so there are no surprises. 

### 22\. What's included in your pricing package?




Every wedding band will have different perks in their packages. Get a detailed list of what's included, like how long they perform or if they can bring dance floor lighting. Also, ask about what add-on services they offer and what they cost. 

### 23\. Will you also act as an emcee?




There's no guarantee the band leader will act as the emcee during the reception. This role can also fall on your planner, venue coordinator or even a wedding party member, but clarify if they can take on this role and if it's included in their package.

### 24\. Does your contract include an overtime clause?




Inquire about overtime charges if you and your partner don't want the party to end right away. "Most [wedding band contracts](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-reception-music-contract-points) include an overtime clause, which is often portioned by 30-minute additional slots," Titchenell tells us. And though it's crucial to ask your wedding band about this, reach out to your venue too. While Titchenell notes that most wedding bands would be happy to keep playing, some venues have strict time limits. 

### 25\. Does your rate include setup and breakdown services?




Not everyone thinks about these [hidden wedding costs](https://www.theknot.com/content/hidden-wedding-costs). Some pros include them in every package, while others don't. Ask what the charges are for the setup and breakdown so you know what you're getting into financially.

### 26\. Does your package include lighting or special effects? 




Beyond music, some pros may bring special lighting or effects, like a fog machine or disco ball. If your pros do amp up their performance with production enhancements, it may come with additional costs. We recommend asking about this early so you can [properly budget](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-budget-ways-to-save-money) for all add-ons.

## Music Style Questions to Ask a Wedding Band

For you and your wedding band to be a match made in musical heaven, you must know their music style. These are the questions to ask your wedding band to determine if they're 'the one.' 

### 27\. What's your performance style?




You need to figure out if how the band performs works with the vibe you're going for. If you want a low-key [cocktail hour](https://www.theknot.com/content/ultimate-cocktail-hour-guide) with lots of casual conversation, a hard rock band will most likely be a music mismatch. Seeing videos of them or watching live helps you make your decision too. 

### 28\. What type of music do you specialize in?




Is their style what you want to hear at your reception? Asking a group that loves to play surf music to switch to jazz standards may not be the best fit. Chat through your musical preferences to know if the band is the right fit.

### 29\. How do you ensure a comfortable sound level for all guests?




It doesn't hurt to have a plan for dealing with volume control and sound-sensitive guests, because what your 14-year-old cousin thinks is the perfect volume is different from what your 89-year-old grandma is willing to put up with. You don't want people trying to socialize shouting to hear one another.

### 30\. What are your favorite wedding songs to play?




Get to know the group's style by chatting about their [favorite wedding songs](https://www.theknot.com/content/billboard-most-popular-wedding-songs) to see if you align musically with each other. This also helps you get to know your pro a little better. Making a connection with the people you're working with is never a bad idea. 

### 31\. Does your band perform live or to tracks?




Some bands may supplement their performances with pre-recorded tracks, while others perform everything live. Ask this question so you know what to expect on the wedding date.

### 32\. Can you supply your music setlist in advance?




Every good band has a diverse song list. Review the current rotation and indicate your favorite selections so you can help them curate a crowd-pleasing playlist. And for those wondering how many songs a wedding band should know or have on their setlist, the consensus is about 30 to 40 songs––depending on how long they're performing and how many sets are agreed on. 

### 33\. Can we give you a list of must-hear and do-not-play songs?




There are songs you just [don't want to hear at your wedding](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-songs-to-skip) and others you desperately need to hear before the night is over. Ask your wedding band if they can avoid certain tracks and ensure others are definitely on the setlist.

### 34\. Will you take song requests from guests during the event?




Check what the protocol will be for making sure your guests hear their favorite tunes (if you even want them to have that creative control). Some pros may prefer to receive a list of songs before the big day, while others could be open to receiving requests during the event.

### 35\. How do you encourage a shy crowd to dance?




Some wedding bands will teach the latest viral dance or verbally encourage guests to step onto the dance floor, while others will select songs that naturally get people moving. Either way, it'll be helpful for you to get a feel for how a potential band will interact with the crowd. "Keeping the dance floor full becomes second nature after years of doing it. This mostly comes down to the selection of songs and keeping an eye on the audience's energy level," Titchenell notes. 

### 36\. Can you play the songs that are most important to us?




When booking a band for a wedding, the questions to ask should also reflect your taste. Your pros should be able to play your favorite music, so ask if they can perform your dream [first dance song](https://www.theknot.com/content/classic-first-dance-songs) or the tune you've always wanted for the [father-daughter dance](https://www.theknot.com/content/father-daugher-wedding-songs). Band members often talk to you about your musical preferences to get to know you and your spouse-to-be to curate a custom playlist. "Connecting on a personal level with clients is always the best approach. I like to know what they listen to when they're driving together on road trips, for example. This lets us know what their favorite songs are as we discuss their wedding vision," Loreto says.
