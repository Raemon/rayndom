## 1\. "Forever," by Natasha Niemi 

"It took me awhile/ But I finally asked you on a date/The years have passed by,/ And we have grown together/ I feel in my heart/ That we are forever/ Each night that we are apart,/ My heart is pierced with a burning dart/ Please tell me/ That wonderful things last forever/ By agreeing to be in my wife/ For now and always/ Marry me."

## 2\. "The Marriage Proposal," by Richard Randolph

"I built my house of wood and stone/ I built my house with sinew and bone/ I built it strong to withstand war/ but I put a welcome mat at my door/ I built it here near the sea/ so I can watch the ships sailing free/ And I built it with windows wide/ to better understand the world outside/ From here you can feel the ocean breeze/ and hear the birds singing in the trees/ The fireplace I built of solid stone/ for cold winter nights when I'm reading alone/ For me, it's a beautiful, almost magical place/ filled with a sense of both mystery and grace/ But as I contemplate all that I've done/ I realize my real goal is yet to be won/ It'll all be meaningless without you by my side/ so now I must ask you to please be my bride/ I love you more than anyone I've ever known/ so, if you love me, please, please come home."

## 3\. "A Lover's Pledge," by M.I Pernar

"Throw down a blanket and sit beside me/ On dew covered banks and soft grasses/ A lifetime's tomorrows I'll spend with thee/ Each new day, the last, surpasses/ There'll be music and song and love ever after/ And people will smile when they see/ The love that we bear, the joy and the laughter/ And the children that rest on your knee/ Will I still love you when day turns to night  
And the leaves rustle dry on the ground?/ Will I still hold you when green turns to white  
And winter gales rage all around?/ Mountains may crumble, the seas roil and tumble/ But ne'er will my heart's fire diminish/ While fainter hearts cool and lesser men stumble/ I'll be there still at the finish/ Be my love now and take now our vows/ To be faithful and true to each other/ Each other's by vow, we'll be, then as now/ A husband, a wife and true lovers."

## 4\. "Will You Marry Me?," by John Mangalindan

"It's been a while and now i know/ That i can never ever let you go/ From the first time we met and your first hello/ I knew you're the one where my heart will grow/ You are my dream..the angel from the sky/ Who showed me what life is and how I can cry/ How I can have someone who I can always rely/ To be there forever and never say goodbye/ The one I can hug when I am in need/ The one who give love.. that no one can exceed/ The one who'll shed tears …if my heart ever bleed/ The one I have wanted..to share my life with…/ So, Now i ask you this …will please you take my hand/ And be the person… who will always understand/ I want to grow old with you..i'm down on one knee/ You're the only one I'll ask…"will you marry me?"

## 5\. "Marriage Proposal," by John Campbell 

"You are in my dreams a future with you I hope to come true/ My life will never be complete without you/ True love did not exist until you came into my life/ I kneel before you with a ring in hand hoping you will become my wife/ The room goes silent nothing to be heard/ My stomach fills with butterflies awaiting her word/Tears begin to flow from her adoring eyes/ My body has become frozen in time awaiting her reply/ She reaches over and whispers in my ear/ A hug and a kiss and those magic words I yearn to hear/ Now a new life begins two hearts as one/ Our journey through life has just begun."

## 6\. "If Love Were Enough," by Sharon Chira

"If Gratitude were enough/ I'd fill the oceans with mine for having you/ If laughter were enough/ I'd make you laugh till your last breath/ Just so I can hear that beautiful sound for eternity/ If dancing was enough/ I'd waltz and foxtrot with you till your feet hurt/ If tenderness was enough/ I'd then spend the rest of the day massaging those feet/ Just so I can take the aching away/ If life were enough/ I'd trade mine for yours in a heartbeat/ Just so you can live to fulfil all your heart's desires/ As all I want for you is your never-ending joy/ Your gentleness, coyness, kindness/ And if love were enough/ I'd love you in and out of time/ As I love you from this day onwards/ I will love you beyond my final breath"

## 7\. "My Everything," by TommyGPoetry

"Please take my hand and walk with me.../ Through sunny fields, past sights unseen/ I will caress your face, to me you will sing/ While kissing your lips, we will dance with glee/laughing and hugging for all to see/ Please take my hand and walk with me.../ Over mountain peaks, we share a dream/ together forever, a loving team/ We will travel upon golden streets/ or fly above, our hearts one beat/ Please take my hand and walk with me.../ I get on my knee with this diamond ring/ because you are my everything!"

## 8\. "I Carry Your Heart With Me," by E. E. Cummings

"I carry your heart with me (i carry it in/ my heart) i am never without it (anywhere  
i go you go, my dear; and whatever is done/ by only me is your doing, my darling)/ i fear no fate (for you are my fate, my sweet) i want/ no world (for beautiful you are my world, my true)  
and it's you are whatever a moon has always meant/ and whatever a sun will always sing is you/ here is the deepest secret nobody knows/ (here is the root of the root and the bud of the bud/ and the sky of the sky of a tree called life; which grows/ higher than soul can hope or mind can hide)/ and this is the wonder that's keeping the stars apart/ i carry your heart (i carry it in my heart)."

## 9\. "The Proposal," by CMGrimm

"A soft breeze gently rustles/ the golden leaves that have fallen/ scattered about/ below the twisted grey branches/ of the tree/ from which we used to swing/ Our names, carved by the hand/ of this tenderhearted young boy/ still echo love/ of youth and of each other/ I now take your hand in mine/ and beneath the shadow of this tree/ a testament and reminder of our love/ I ask that we never allow it to fade/ into the grayness of those limbs/ or to dry and crumble like the leaves/ that have fallen to the ground/ But that we allow it to grow/ ever upward, and to be strong/ as the trunk of the great tree itself/ that bears the evidence of this great love/ which beneath its arms began/ A soft breeze gently rustles/ the golden leaves that have fallen/ scattered about/ below the twisted grey branches/ of the tree/ from which we used to swing/ Our names, carved by the hand/ of this tenderhearted young boy/ still echo love/ of youth and of each other/ I now take your hand in mine/ and beneath the shadow of this tree/ a testament and reminder of our love/ I ask that we never allow it to fade/ into the grayness of those limbs/ or to dry and crumble like the leaves/ that have fallen to the ground/ But that we allow it to grow/ ever upward, and to be strong/ as the trunk of the great tree itself/ that bears the evidence of this great love/ which beneath its arms began."

## 10\. "Marriage Proposal for Eternity," by James Aguilar 

"I kneel and hand you this ring/ That symbolizes our marriage and eternal love / Maybe it's intuition/ Some things you just don't question/ Like in your eyes/ I see my future in an instant/ And there it goes/ I know I've found my best friend/ I knew I loved you before I met you/ I believed and dreamed you into life/ I have been waiting all my life for you/ I've found my meaning to live again/ I am complete now that I have found you/ Anytime I need to see your face / I just close my eyes/ And I am taken to a place/ Where love is born and secured/ Sweet like fine sugar/ I don't need to try to explain/ I just hold on tight and if it happens again/ I may move into to your heart/ Look into my eyes they are not telling lies/ I'm the kind of person who endorses a deep commitment/ Getting comfy seeking true love is what I live for/ A smell of perfume knocks me down to your command / It's like I'm down on the floor inside our heart/ And/ I don't know what makes love and perfume/ Have so many similarities that make two people bond/ Using symbols, using words can be linked/ When love shoots it should be aimed for eternity/ Eight things that make our love's constitution strong/ I believe Jehovah God makes marriage last/ I believe the sun should never set upon an argument/ I believe you can't appreciate real love until you've been burned/ I believe the most attractive features are the heart and soul/ I believe that family is worth more than money or gold/ I believe the only ones who disagree are players or evil spirits/ I believe forgiveness is the key to true happiness/ I believe in love surviving death into eternity/ I want to move in time with you/ I want my heart beat match yours/ I want to feel your hand in mine/ And do all the things you want me to/ The autumn/ breeze that comes from the mountains/ Will be the legitimate witness of my proposal for our love / So I ask you to take this time to answer would you marry me?"

## 11\. "A Marriage Proposal," by Dane Ann Smith Johnsen

"Oh vow, thy love, eternally/ A marriage filled with bliss/ Promise your heart beyond a kiss/ Together living strongly, we/ Sing out fulfillment rosy, dreamy/ Our royal goal, prince and princess/ Let not decisions be amiss/ Pledge now, forever-loyalty/ Let two hearts soar to merriment/ Embark with zest; set sights above/ Dwell in faith's arms/ which heaven sent/ Let love rely on God…white dove/ My faithfulness shall not relent/ Please marry my eternal love."

## 12\. "I Love You," by Ella Wheeler Wilcox

"I love your lips when they're wet with wine/ And red with a wild desire/ I love your eyes when the lovelight lies/ Lit with a passionate fire/ I love your arms when the warm white flesh/ Touches mine in a fond embrace/ I love your hair when the strands enmesh/ Your kisses against my face/ Not for me the cold, calm kiss/ Of a virgin's bloodless love/ Not for me the saint's white bliss/ Nor the heart of a spotless dove/ But give me the love that so freely gives/ And laughs at the whole world's blame/ With your body so young and warm in my arms/ It sets my poor heart aflame/ So kiss me sweet with your warm wet mouth/ Still fragrant with ruby wine/ And say with a fervor born of the South/ That your body and soul are mine/ Clasp me close in your warm young arms/ While the pale stars shine above/ And we'll live our whole young lives away/ In the joys of a living love."

## 13\. "Love Sonnet XI," by Pablo Neruda

"I crave your mouth, your voice, your hair./ Silent and starving, I prowl through the streets./ Bread does not nourish me, dawn disrupts me, all day/ I hunt for the liquid measure of your steps./   
I hunger for your sleek laugh,/ your hands the color of a savage harvest,/ hunger for the pale stones of your fingernails,/ I want to eat your skin like a whole almond./ I want to eat the sunbeam flaring in your lovely body,/ the sovereign nose of your arrogant face,/ I want to eat the fleeting shade of your lashes,/ and I pace around hungry, sniffing the twilight,/ hunting for you, for your hot heart,/ like a puma in the barrens of Quitratue." 

## 14\. "Basket of Figs," by Ellen Bass

"Bring me your pain, love. Spread/ it out like fine rugs, silk sashes,/ warm eggs, cinnamon/ and cloves in burlap sacks. Show me/ the detail, the intricate embroidery/ on the collar, tiny shell buttons,   
the hem stitched the way you were taught,/ pricking just a thread, almost invisible./ Unclasp it like jewels, the gold/ still hot from your body. Empty/ your basket of figs. Spill your wine./ That hard nugget of pain, I would suck it, / cradling it on my tongue like the slick/ seed of pomegranate. I would lift it/ tenderly, as a great animal might/ carry a small one in the private/ cave of the mouth.

## 15\. "To My Dear and Loving Husband," by Anne Bradstreet

"If ever two were one, then surely we./ If ever man were loved by wife, then thee./ If ever wife was happy in a man,/ Compare with me, ye women, if you can./ I prize thy love more than whole mines of gold,/ Or all the riches that the East doth hold./ My love is such that rivers cannot quench,/ Nor ought but love from thee give recompense./ Thy love is such I can no way repay;/ The heavens reward thee manifold, I pray./ Then while we live, in love let's so persever,/ That when we live no more, we may live ever."

## 16\. "To Be In Love," by Gwendolyn Elizabeth Brooks

"To be in love/ Is to touch with a lighter hand./ In yourself you stretch, you are well./ You look at things/ Through his eyes./ A cardinal is red./ A sky is blue./ Suddenly you know he knows too./ He is not there but/ You know you are tasting together/ The winter, or a light spring weather./ His hand to take your hand is overmuch./ Too much to bear./ You cannot look in his eyes/ Because your pulse must not say/ What must not be said./ When he/ Shuts a door/ Is not there/ Your arms are water./ And you are free/ With a ghastly freedom./ You are the beautiful half/ Of a golden hurt./ You remember and covet his mouth/ To touch, to whisper on./ Oh when to declare./ Is certain Death!/ Oh when to apprize/ Is to mesmerize,/ To see fall down, the Column of Gold,/ Into the commonest ash."
