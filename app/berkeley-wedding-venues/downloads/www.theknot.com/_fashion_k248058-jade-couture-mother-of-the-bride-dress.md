Description

A magnificent Stretch Soft Crepe and Adeline Sequin Lace Fit & Flare gown with a slightly plunging portrait neckline, below the elbow sleeves and beautiful sequined lace appliqués trickling down below the waist. The back neckline gently goes across your shoulders and the back has a wonderful look and fit. The front of the skirt has a ruffle cascade that gently comes from the sequined lace appliqués and then creates the sexy slit.
