If you and your partner are passionate about the arts, looking at [museum wedding venues](https://www.theknot.com/content/museum-wedding-venues) is a great option for you. We love how guests could be seated among dozens of eye-catching paintings during dinner. 

### 2\. Campground Venue

If you're putting your guests up at a nostalgic campground, consider getting married in the same area as your accommodations. At this glamping wedding, Airstreams and tents were the reception backdrop and where guests slept that night. 

### 3\. Concert Theater Venue

![Theater unique wedding venue](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/d5e7206c-686e-40ac-b101-07a2eaf4f1a5~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1488.1116)

_[Photo: Jana Marie Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/jana-marie-photography-independence-mo-389986)_

Having some relationship history attached to your wedding venue always makes it unique. So if you have fond memories of a concert together, try out a theater venue. The couple chose this glamorous venue because it's where they attended their first concert together.

### 4\. Tree House Venue

![Tree house unique wedding venue](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/8dee0cc2-3113-48b1-85fd-985e19ecd388~rs_768.h-cr_0.180.1080.1620)

If [fairy-tale wedding ideas](https://www.theknot.com/content/fairytale-wedding-theme) are on your mood board, you need to book a [castle](https://www.theknot.com/content/enchanting-wedding-castles-venues) for your event. By choosing this type of venue, you and your partner will feel like royalty. 

### 7\. Beachside Venue

![Unique beachside wedding venue](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/a94abf23-76d1-4fa0-b2d9-bdb502b318a0~rs_768.h-cr_0.61.919.1286)

_[Photo: Danforth Neal](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/danforth-neal-palm-springs-ca-950140),__[Venue: Delek Tulum](https://delektulum.com/)_

You can't go wrong with a reception on the beach. Put your toes in the sand while you dance the night away with loved ones.

[More Seating Chart Ideas](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-to-seat-guests-at-wedding-reception)

### 8\. Retro Seating Chart

![Unique retro seating chart](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/766e5c1c-33b3-40a1-a2dc-e4e0068533d4~rs_768.h-cr_0.61.919.1286)

_[Photo: Cloud Craft Wedding Films](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/cloud-craft-wedding-films-austin-tx-1058801),__[Venue: The Addison Grove](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/the-addison-grove-austin-tx-969127)_

For this disco-inspired wedding, the couple created a seating chart that matched their groovy theme. We love the bubble font and vibrant color scheme they chose. 

### 9\. Clipboard Seating Chart Display

![Unique clipboard seating display ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/e5e334be-e404-487b-950b-1bd97477b01a~rs_768.h-cr_0.59.1080.1499)

_Photo: Mae Stier Photography,__Calligrapher: Lydia Writes Good_

We suggest going the unconventional route for your seating chart if you're planning an alternative wedding. For example, the bride, who's a graphic designer and copywriter, used hand-lettered typography to reflect the quirky feel she wanted.

### 10\. Mirror Seating Chart Display

![Unique mirror seating chart ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/59ae0288-ce32-4196-8e61-3dc957676d84~rs_768.h-cr_0.149.1080.1589)

_[Photo: Apollo Fotografie {Photo + Video}](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/apollo-fotografie-photo-+-video-novato-ca-542367),__[Calligrapher: Margo Designs](https://www.etsy.com/shop/MargoDesignsStore)_

Give guests the opportunity to check out their wedding look as they see where they're seated by writing your seating chart on a mirror. If you want to steal this idea, you and your partner should go thrift shopping for the mirrors so you can save some money and add a nice personal touch to the display. 

### 11\. Potted Plant Seating Chart Display

![Unique potted plants seating chart](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/811374ef-3537-4c77-ab19-2e6b7dc766dc~rs_768.h-cr_0.166.2000.2833)

_[Photo: Bo Shim](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/bo-shim-new-york-ny-980553),__[Venue: Blooming Hill Farm](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/blooming-hill-farm-blooming-grove-ny-1012917)_

Potted plants are the perfect option for a rustic affair. To create this easy seating chart, use each pot to represent a table, then write guests' names on them. We suggest planting flowers or herbs that promote positive omens in the pots, such as lavender, which represents purity, calmness and devotion. 

### 12\. Cutting Board Seating Chart Display

![Unique cutting board seating chart display](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/b50de74b-c19f-4807-9a88-25010e2bc813~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.919.1225)

If farm-to-table cuisine is a must-have for your wedding, hint about the meal to come through your seating chart. We think this display of wood cutting boards does just that, while also adding warmth and texture. 

### 13\. Illustrated Seating Chart

![Unique illustrated seating chart](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/d8580be9-a96f-4610-b8d1-fd10ef0b1c35~rs_768.h-cr_122.0.1899.1333)

_[Photo: The Grays Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/the-grays-photography-kansas-city-mo-391271)_

We guarantee that a hand-drawn seating chart will always turn heads. At this Art-Deco wedding, the bride's sister illustrated the seating chart using graphite.

### 14\. Faux Tropical Leaf Seating Chart

![Unique tropical leaf seating chart](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/4bff5144-2e00-4c14-b76e-7c1046b63b5f~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.919.1225)

If you love Greece but can't swing a destination wedding, bring the Aegean Sea's charm stateside. This couple's escort cards took the form of little tags adhered to mini bottles of olive oil and were displayed within a Santorini-style white wall. 

### 19\. Soccer Ball Escort Cards

![Soccer Ball Escort Card Wall in warm beige tones](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/5973a8ce-4151-41fe-9042-a10fd7227502~rs_768.h-cr_0.15.1094.1474)

Sugar and spice and everything nice was the name of the game with these place cards. Calligraphed canisters of fragrant spices were positioned at each place setting to let guests know which seat was theirs.

What's not to love about this [Lambeth wedding cake](https://www.theknot.com/content/lambeth-wedding-cakes)? This maximalist trend (where the cake is "over-piped") has been having a moment and we hope it doesn't end anytime soon. 

### 37\. Floating Illusion Wedding Cake 

![Green and Gold Wedding Cake with trailing leaves](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/3b9d137f-9bbb-411f-a7cb-3645ab794701~rs_768.h-cr_0.91.1094.1550)

While the last cake we saw had a floating tier, this entire bake is suspended in the air thanks to a cool swing. The white-and-silver cake looks straight out of _The_ _Great Gatsby_ , and we're not mad about it. 

### 39\. Retro-Inspired Wedding Cake

![Retro wedding cake in bright primary colors](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/5b1fe08a-c921-4a2c-8849-f878cc6b0c26~rs_768.h-cr_0.90.1080.1530)

### 40\. Wedding Cake With Cold Sparklers

Sparklers inside? Don't worry, cold sparklers are, as the name suggests, a cool product that's safe indoors. This couple upped the ante by sticking the pyrotechnics in their wedding cake. 

### 41\. Colorful Wedding Cake Display 

![Polka-dot wedding cake display for a dessert buffet](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/a7b5ea99-ba02-45ce-9dad-77c8e44c8d38~rs_768.h-cr_122.0.1094.729)

This couple's pets couldn't attend the wedding so they decided to include them in cryogenic form. A dramatic ice sculpture bore the likeness of the couple's furry friends in addition to the lovebirds' monogram.

## Tips for Planning a Unique Wedding 

After perusing the unusual wedding ideas above, you're sure to start wondering how you can come up with your own fun wedding ideas. We tapped some of our [favorite wedding pros](https://www.theknot.com/content/ones-to-watch) to get the inside scoop on creating unique wedding ideas for the reception. Keep these must-know tips in mind as you start planning your celebration. 

### Let Your Shared Hobbies Inspire You

If you've looked at all the newest [wedding reception trends](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-reception-trends) and still can't come up with original ideas for your event, use the activities that bring you and your partner joy as thought starters. "Think about what you both love and if there are experiences you've had together that you would want to relive or incorporate," suggests Diana Lin, a passionate wedding planner and the owner of [Cóllectives by Diana](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/collectives-by-diana-new-york-ny-2046692). She adds: "I take inspiration from my travels, art and fashion. It's always a great starting point because it can guide you the rest of the way. Don't think about what's normal or traditional, instead, think about what makes your day uniquely yours." 

Virginia Frischkorn, an experienced wedding planner and the founder of [Partytrick](https://www.partytrick.com/), concurs. "Think of activities you've done as a couple that have brought you the most joy. Recreate that for your guests so they can have a peek into what makes you happiest. Genuine moments or experiences are what create the strongest bonds," she says.

### Keep Practicality in Mind

Even though the sky is the limit with unique wedding ideas, do keep in mind that they need to be feasible for you and your wedding planner. Ashley Mason, the owner of [Saunter Weddings](https://www.instagram.com/saunterweddings/?hl=en) for more than 11 years, says that taper candles are one such idea that looks great, but isn't the most practical for a large wedding reception. "Ever since the boom of Pinterest, photos of mass taper candles have been in inspiration folders across the board. As beautiful as they always are, many indoor venues don't allow open flames and require candles to be enclosed for safety. It's always a good idea to check with the venue's decor policy before booking. Ensure your heart-set ideas can be made possible before signing the contract," she says.
