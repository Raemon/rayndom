If you and your partner want to impress your guests with live entertainment that pays homage to your heritage, a bagpiper for weddings can help. "Bagpipes add an additional element to a wedding that really stands out to your guests and it's a tradition that many families keep for generations," says [Brian Caltabiano](https://www.instagram.com/brian_the_bagpiper/), New York City-based bagpiper.

[READ MORE Enter a Location and Filter By Instruments and Pricing ](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/wedding-soloists-ensembles)

To learn more about having bagpipes at a wedding and the factors to consider when hiring bagpipe players for weddings, we tapped Caltabiano, Scotland-based bagpiper [Jason Faulkner](https://bagpiperjasonfaulkner.scot/), Marty McAndrew, band manager of [Shannon Rovers Irish Pipe Band](https://shannonrovers.com/) and Craig McIntosh, [Royal Deeside Bagpiper](https://theyorkshirebagpiper.com/). 

**Wedding Bagpiper Tips:** Should I Have a Bagpiper at My Wedding? | Cost | Timing | How to Hire | Who to Hire




## Should I Have a Bagpiper at My Wedding? 

Whether you should have bagpipes for your wedding ceremony will depend on your music preferences and the type of atmosphere you want to create for you and your guests on your special day. In addition, Faulkner notes that bagpipes can bring people together, especially if you are Scottish, have any Scottish relatives or want to incorporate [Scottish wedding music](https://www.theknot.com/content/scottish-wedding-songs) (or [Irish wedding songs](https://www.theknot.com/content/irish-wedding-songs)) into your wedding. 

[READ MORE Enter a Location and Filter By Instruments and Pricing ](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/wedding-soloists-ensembles)

If you have room remaining in your wedding budget, a bagpiper can serve as a quality investment that will engage guests and leave a lasting impression. That said, it's a decision that should not be taken lightly as bagpipes are loud and occupy a lot of space which could potentially take attention away from you and your partner. 

## How Much Is a Bagpiper for a Wedding? 

As is the case when hiring any form of entertainment for your wedding festivities, it is important to know how much money you should allocate. Many factors can influence the [average cost of wedding musicians](https://www.theknot.com/content/average-cost-wedding-band-dj), such as the time commitment, years of experience, special song requests, the number of pipers hired (if a band) and travel (if needed). 

FEATURED VIDEO FROM THE KNOT

"A solo bagpiper costs anywhere from $200–500 to play, and it all depends on how long you want the pipes played and the piper's travel time," Caltabiano explains. "A full set up of playing pipes when the groom/groomsmen arrive, guests arrive, when the bride arrives and then playing for about 20 minutes at the conclusion of the ceremony will be in the $400–500 range. If this is too expensive, you can always ask for less music. Pipes playing when the wedding ceremony has concluded for about three to five minutes would put you in the $200–300 range." 

That said, the price to hire bagpipes for a wedding can vary depending on location. For a [wedding budget planner](https://www.theknot.com/wedding-budget) who can help you learn more about how much real couples pay for wedding bagpipers and other wedding vendors in different locations across the US, use The Knot Budget Advisor. It's a great resource to utilize throughout your wedding planning process. And, it's free. 

As far as tips are concerned. If you'd like to conduct some further research about how much to tip your wedding bagpiper, refer to our [wedding vendor tipping sheet](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-vendor-tipping-cheat-sheet).

## When Do Bagpipes Play at a Wedding? 

One of the reasons couples hire bagpipe players for weddings is that there are many points throughout the celebration during which they can be played. Although you can request your wedding bagpiper to play at any point throughout your special day, Caltabiano and McIntosh note certain times tend to be more popular, such as while guests arrive, before and after the ceremony, at the start and ending of cocktail hour and during the wedding party's entrance into the reception to name a few. "The best times for bagpipes are before and after your wedding ceremony," explains Caltabiano. "I have played outdoor Scottish weddings where 'Scotland the Brave' is requested as the newly married couple walk out of the ceremony." 

### Find your kind of venue

From barns to ballrooms, discover reception venues that feel like you.

Although knowing the popular times bagpipes are played during weddings is key, it is equally important to know the points during which many bagpipers wouldn't recommend playing, as the sound may interrupt the flow and/or guest interactions throughout your celebration. "Try not to have bagpipes in the middle of your ceremony as there's no need for bagpipes in between a poetry reading or after exchanging vows," Caltabiano explains. "They are an incredibly loud instrument, so having pipes in the middle of your ceremony can be rough." McAndrew also notes that you might want to request that your pipers not play during mealtime. 

## How to Hire a Bagpipe Player for Your Wedding

Once you've decided to hire a wedding bagpiper, it's time to start finding a suitable wedding bagpipe player for your special day. Similar to [finding local vendors](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-to-find-local-wedding-vendors) (whether it be wedding venues or caterers), you'll want to reserve your wedding bagpiper sooner rather than later. McAndrews notes that booking a piper should ideally be done anytime between 30 days and nine months from your event, depending on the piper's schedule and piper type. "If you have any special tune requests, book your piper at least a month in advance," Caltabiano advises.

When looking for the perfect bagpiper to fit into your special day, you want to make sure both you (and your partner) and the piper have the same expectations regarding how the day will go. One way to ensure you are on the same page is to ask clarifying questions during the first few initial exchanges. "Some questions you can ask pipers of interest include 'How long have you been playing?', 'Do you play with a band or just play solos?', 'What tunes (or [bagpipe wedding songs](https://www.theknot.com/content/bagpipe-wedding-songs)) do you play?', 'Do you have examples of your previous engagements?' and 'Can you send over references or testimonials?" McAndrew says. Additionally, Caltabiano notes that you want to ensure your piper knows the exact times they are expected to be present and what tunes they're expected to play at each time to ensure they are being fairly compensated for their time and can meet client expectations. 

Although you can ask relatives who hired bagpipes for their weddings for references, you can also find bagpipe players near you on [The Knot Vendor Marketplace](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/wedding-soloists-ensembles).
