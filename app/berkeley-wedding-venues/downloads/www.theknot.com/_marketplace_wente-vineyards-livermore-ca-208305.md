Pretty solid winery venue in the Bay Area. I captured a wedding here in 2015 and then again in 2023 - the getting ready spaces are some of the worst I've ever seen. The main coordi...

nator for the property did not treat the photo and video team that well, she took us up to spots in a golf cart and told us what her favorite photographers do. She was on her phone most of the time. Everyone seemed happy, especially the couple which is the most important. This was a huge South Indian wedding and it was a good time overall. I think there are better venues in the area

Stunning views, picturesque golden hour photos. We had just over 100 guests and held the reception in the Event Center. It is a bit of a tight squeeze at that number, and the dan...

ce floor is awkwardly off to the side. If you're looking to invite more than 100 I would recommend having the reception on the great lawn where there's more space - you will need to rent outside flooring and lights externally which range upwards of $10K from vendors. They have 3 different locations to hold events, 2 lawns and 1 event center -- the lawn with the string lights is a bit of a long walk to the bathrooms and kitchen, so be sure to utilize golf carts back and forth or make your guests walk. I will say the monetary value doesn't quite add up to the overall value. $15,000 for the space only on and basic tables/chairs. This doesn't include any vendors, the cost of wine which must be purchased at 4 case minimum, or even heaters - which are $150 per heater. If you're looking for a blank slate to pick and choose everything for your wedding, this is a great option, but be prepared to spend a ton of money. This isn't a budget-friendly option. Makenna was fantastic on the day-of coordination and was so supportive! Thank you to everyone for your communication and day-of support.

ccommodating and patient through everything. They allowed us to take our time to make a decision, always answered our emails (we had several during this time!) and never made us feel like a burden. In the end we decided to cancel our wedding celebration, and plan for a future event at a later date. But from the initial walk-through, to the food tasting (omg the food was amazing and am sad our guests never got to taste the amazingness that's Wente Catering!), and cake tasting, we were always made to feel like our wedding celebration was the only event they were planning. We cant say enough good things about Wente, and hope you all get to experience an event at their spacious venue. They has also recently redone their bathrooms, which looked amazing at our last walk through in February. If you want a stress-free wedding planning experience, Wente is the best option out there. Their catering and sales staff take care of everything!

We did not have to worry about a thing the day of the wedding. Wente was perfect, and we highly recommend it!

Overall, Cresta Blanca / Terrace lawn is a disappointing venue for a wedding. From bland white washed architecture to dull and inexperienced staff, Northern California has so much...

more than the offerings of Wente. The newly renovated restaurant is well on the right track aesthetically but the event center is lackluster at best. Bridal rooms are big empty rooms with zero character, all furniture pushed against the walls and a giant ( not working ) TV being stored in the room was sadly in most photos. Lawn grass was patchy, uneven and an eye sore. Our assigned coordinator was not helpful, bridesmaids had to ask her to do things she should have done correctly the first time ie set up the signage properly, ensure that the ceremony started on time etc. The coordinator was confused about which side the bride and groom took - yikes. The lights in the reception were cranked up, it felt like a cafeteria and weren’t dimmed when we asked them to be. Prior to the ceremony guests arrived and sat in the restaurant for a wine tasting but when it was time for the ceremony the server expressed her annoyance that they didn’t spend more. One thing the venue does get right is provisions. Wente makes a killer Cabernet and an even better steak. Unless you’re getting an amazing deal at Wente, consider seeking other options.

ing went wrong, everyone loved the food, the sunset was perfect and the marquee lights were a great touch. So glad we chose the Vineyard Lawn because you have more privacy (ie. no wine tasters or dinner patrons staring) I was worried everything would be close together but it’s actually a huge lawn once all put together. I wish I could add pictures but feel free to email me ashleyrose6743 at gmail dot com and send some! The fact you get food, tables, chairs, open bar with everything, day of coordinator, assistant and full planner (plus MUCH more) is insane. I still can’t believe we got all that.

d one that had history and culture associated with it. We ate at the Wente restaurant and the food was to die for, plus the scenery was gorgeous. we met with their event staff to discuss having our wedding there, and when we heard they offer a wedding coordinator that was included in the venue fee, we knew that this would be the perfect place. Our wedding coordinator was Christine and our day of coordinator was Kayla. Bother were amazingly responsive to all of my questions (there were a lot) and they set us up with each of our vendors. Since we had our reception outside, they were able to get us all the quotes for lighting, dance floor, etc. I had multiple requests to see prices of different items and Christine happily went back to the vendors each time to request something new. A few days before our wedding there was a chance of rain, and in no time at all Christine had helped come up with a new plan if needed (but it didn't end up raining!) They have a great facility above the Cresta Blanca room to get ready for the girls and the guys, and on the day of the wedding Kayla our day of coordinator made sure we were taken care of. Having a coordinator who knows the property made everything a breeze. She helped us stick to our timeline, gave us wine whenever we needed, and was the sweetest person to work with! Wente also makes the cake and will do whatever design you would like- we went with chocolate fig and pistachio - both were delicious. The food portions are very large, not like typical small wedding portions, and everyone commented that it was probably the best pork chop they had ever had and that the salmon was cooked perfectly. The day of service staff was courteous, quick, and helpful. They give you a list of vendors who they prefer to work with and I would definitely go with those people- we did and they were all amazing and know the property so it makes their set up super easy. I can't say enough how these girls, as well as Wente, truly made our wedding more perfect than we could have ever imagined!

This review is a bit overdue. I got married at the Event Center in November, and it was incredible. We set the date one year in advance, in November, 2016, because Saturdays were...

filling up fast for 2017. Throughout the next year we worked with Tricia to plan our day. Tricia helped us pick out the menu, the room upgrades (linens, lighting, draping), and all the logistics (processional, timing). At the rehearsal we met with Stephanie and Kayla, the Day of Coordinators. They were both very sweet and professional, going over all the details with us to make sure it was perfect. When we arrived on our wedding day, everything was taken care of us for us. Here are the highlights of the day: \- Our ceremony was supposed to be on the Terrace Lawn, but it rained and was super cold that day, so Tricia made special arrangements for us to be moved inside their barrel room. It turned out so romantic and intimate. \- The food was incredible. We did the plated dinner with salmon and pork chop options. I didn't have the pork chop but many guests said it was the best they had ever had. \- Our cake was provided by Wente and it was so beautiful. We paid the upgrade for it to look like birch bark with cascading leaves down it, but it was so worth it. The pastry team outdid themselves. Stephanie sent me home with a slice from each layer after the wedding and it was so good! \- The organization and timing was impeccable. Everything we laid out was right on track. As a very prompt person, I appreciated this. From when our dinner was served, to when we did our first dance, we kept right on schedule. \- The service was spot on. Before the ceremony, Stephanie kept checking in with me on updates on how many guests had arrived, and the service kept going from there. Stephanie and Kayla made sure I always had a glass of my drink of choice on hand, waiting on me while I was busy with guests. My groom and I had appetizers at our table (from what we missed at our cocktail hour). At the end of the night, they packaged up all our items and gave us slices of cake and a bottle of bubbles. Really, Wente outdid themselves. Our guests loved our wedding and so did we. Great job!

Amazing venue. I had my wedding at the terrace lawn and event center. Even though it was the pricier option of the three they offer, I loved it because you have the flexibility of ...

having both the indoor venue and the outdoor venue which both are large areas. Additionally, you also get the two changing rooms with the most beautiful window for the bridal changing room for pictures! On our wedding day, there was a heat wave and luckily we had the indoor venue for guests to cool off. We had the ceremony and reception dinner outside on the lawn but moved inside for cake cutting and dancing. It was the best! And most importantly, the service that Wente offered was incredible. From the planning process, with Tricia, she was always attentive and accommodating to my many ideas. The day of wedding coordinators, Camille, Kristin, and Dominique, were also incredible. They made sure everything was the way we asked and myself and the whole wedding party and guests were not stressed! And lastly, the servers at Wente were so attentive to my guests! We were so impressed with the entire Wente team and the experience. Our guests are still raving about the venue for the beauty and service.

It really helped me relax knowing that our coordinator had all the details and was ready to go. The service all night was extraordinary and I strongly recommend any couple take a look at Wente. I would be remiss not to mention the FOOD! Everyone complimented us and literally everything tasted incredible. I can't imagine getting married anywhere else.

We received so many compliments, and kept telling eachother we were so glad we chose Wente. There are a lot of great spots for photo ops, whether its in front of the rolling hills, or out alone the green grape vines. I am so happy and would do it all over again in a heartbeat. Beware, it isn't cheap. Best, Ashley

We chose to have our wedding at Wente Vineyards for a few reasons: (1) their food is fabulous! (2) the venue had special meaning for me as my family would go to their restaurant fo...

r special meals and (3) it had a laid-back but beautiful feel to the grounds which matched our styles! We rented the event center and concert lawn but chose to have our ceremony elsewhere. While the venue is definitely not cheap, the food was worth every penny and the grounds were beautiful (which meant we didn't have to add much to it). All our guests had a fabulous time, loved the food and the views of the hills and vineyard!

Not only are the grounds just GORGEOUS, but Georgine went above and beyond to assist me in planning my wedding. She was always prompt to respond to my emails (I planned this weddin...

g from Florida!), had all the answers, and provided excellent recommendations for local vendors. What I particularly love about Wente is that they provide the cuisine (with lots of delicious selections), alcohol, they even make your cake, AND they provide you with a day-of-coordinator. Wente was flexible with everything. My husband and I asked for specific signature drinks to be prepared and they accommodated without any hesitation :) The facilities are top notch as is the service. I LOVED my wedding day and I wouldn't change a thing about it.

Wente is an amazing location for wine tasting and events. My husband and I chose this venue because it was the best value for our money. It included a lot of things that other site...

s did not, like the cake! Our coordinator was very helpful and responsive to questions. The staff was very receptive to our instructions for setting up the venue. It was so nice not having to worry about all the detail set up or clean up. They set up everything perfectly and I did not have to worry about a thing. There was a small issue right before the ceremony when a vase blew over and shattered. They were on it immediately and had it cleaned up in less than 5 minutes. They even fixed up the flowers so it looked like the vases were never intended to be there. I had my heart set on an ice cream bar and they created a very rustic, beautiful one for a very small extra fee. The whole event went flawlessly. The food service ran on time, almost impossible for weddings, the booze never stopped flowing and the staff was friendly and professional. Their cost is not cheap, but it is worth every penny. They are still much more affordable than other venues in the same area. I can't wait to celebrate other events here.

The whole process with Wente was an absolute dream. The location was beautiful, food was the best wedding food I've ever had and the service could not be beat. Our planner, Tricia,...

was phenomenal. She was friendly, helpful and full of good advice. She really cared that we had the wedding we wanted. It wound up raining on our wedding day and the entire event was planned as an outdoor event. In just a few hours before the wedding, Wente was able to entirely transform the event to be indoors and it went off without a hitch. Our guests never knew it was intended to be an outdoor wedding. We have nothing but great things to say about Wente!

What can I say but THANK YOU to Wente Vineyards? Georgie the event coordinator was wonderful throughout the entire planning process. I had originally put a deposit down for their...

Murrieta's Well venue. About five months before the wedding, Georgie called with bad news. Due to newly implemented city laws, Wente had to retro-fit the Murrieta's Well building and therefore had to shut down for a few months. Unfortunately my wedding was during those shut-down months and I would not be able to have my wedding there. This was not Wente's fault since city ordinances are out of their control. Georgie and her supervisor at Wente were very accommodating and helpful in moving my wedding to the main Wente Vineyards site and working with me to retain the vision I had for my wedding. Sarah the day-of coordinator was kind, calming, and made the big-day proceed flawlessly. All the wait staff were professional, courteous, and attentive. They readily refilled beverages without needing to be flagged down. Service was for the most part timely. The catering was fantastic, delicious, well proportioned. Even my "foodie" friends praised the food. The beer and spirits selections were limited, but the wine was very nice. It's a winery, I did not expect them to have a plethora of beers. The behind the scenes staff went above and beyond to set up and make the venue extraordinarily beautiful and orderly beyond my expectations. All my guests enjoyed themselves.

As much as I would like to give this place 5 stars but I am afraid, I cannot because of the following reasons below: My friend had her wedding here at Wente. It was outside cer...

emony and the reception is inside the hall. Ceremony - It was OK. I feel that their assigned wedding coordinator did not help that much. They played music but you can barely hear it at least they should have at least mention to my friend about the music and whatnot. Reception: 1\. IT WAS HOTTTT inside! I know it was hot in July but my gosh, their AC is not strong enough to handle too many people inside the reception hall. As much as I wanted to savour the unlimited wine and drinks but we cannot because it was extremely hot! My friend's guests were going in and out of the hall cause we couldn't take the heat. I am sure they have been doing many wedding events and by now know that upgrade their AC. My friend's guests were going in and out of the hall cause we couldn't take the heat. 2\. Unlimited wine - why ask the guests 'do you want more wine?' my friend, the bride, was upset about that! They paid a fortune for their wedding and she heard them asked if her guests wants more wine? She came up to the server and tell them to pour the wine if they are half empty...Like I've said, I like their wines but I just didn't enjoy it that night. 3\. Service - their assigned wedding coordinator didn't even do anything to see if the guests are happy. I am positive that she is also experiencing the hotness inside the hall but didn't do anything about it. When I saw her at the bar area, I feel like she just want to get this wedding over and done with, I could tell from her facial expression/gestures. We have to keep on looking for the servers if we want something...hayy...the food is good though. I enjoyed the combo - chicken/fish! All in all, it would have been perfect if my friend had an outside reception but oh well...these are just my opinion. I suggest to visit their wedding reception first (if you want it inside the hall) before making your final decision. Don't get me wrong, I love Wente Vineyards but was not impressed with their wedding ceremony/reception. Sorry!

and the cake was great and looked beautiful. Didn't have to worry about a cake vendor flaking out. The venue itself is BEAUTIFUL. Set amongst trees and hills in the Livermore wine country. Just amazing. The coordinators at Wente are professionals, know what they are doing, and helped make the planning process as painless as possible. Our day-of coordinator was great, right there when we needed her and took care of last-minute details with grace. The food!!!!!!!! Cannot say enough how good the food was. Not some dinky small portion of food that tastes like it has been warmed for 2 hours before serving. Food was warm, fresh, and generous portions! We have received so many rave reviews on the food and cake. Wine was great, as we know it to be since Wente is one of our favorites. Would highly recommend Wente to anyone looking for a wine country wedding that won't break the bank. We booked on a Friday and it worked out well.

was inclement weather. So many possibilities. The most important thing to us was they had a special permit that we could have our band play music outdoors as long as we wanted.;The only thing we didn't like was that we originally wanted to have a cocktail reception outside and based on how the venue wanted to do things we could only do a sitdown dinner or buffet. If you want to have a cocktail reception this is not the place for you. Also we didn't like there could be 2 weddings a day so it limited when you could get onto the venue and how much setup time you had for your vendors.

Wente has a great lawn area and indoor facilities. The planners and coordinators were really on top of things. And the onsite catering and cake were top notch the guests ...

were very impressed.;Because they hold 2 weddings per day there is less flexibility in terms of timings. It can also be very rushed especially if you are there for the day wedding. Throughout the planning process there are many changes in staffing. We only got to find out that our original planner had left when we received auto-replies when we tried to email her. Although the planners taking over are very competent it does add some stress to the bride and groom to have to work with a new planner after having discussed everything with the previous one.
