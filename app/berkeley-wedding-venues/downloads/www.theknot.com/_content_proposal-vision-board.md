Vision boards are a tale as old as time, bringing us back to our school days and cutting up magazines to make our wildest dreams a reality. So it's no wonder proposal vision boards are having a serious moment. Whether you're the one getting down on one knee or the one expecting the proposal, this is a must-have tool for any couple. And while it may not necessarily tell you [how to propose](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-proposals-how-to-propose), it sets the scene for a lasting memory that you'll love to share whenever people inevitably ask, "How did you two get engaged?" Grab your favorite arts and crafts supplies and get to work on making a wow-worthy vision board.

## What is a Proposal Vision Board? 

A proposal vision board is crucial for gathering all of your marriage [proposal ideas](https://www.theknot.com/content/romantic-ways-to-propose) in one place, but it's also a great way to collaborate with your partner on this next journey together. (And you can also use one for your [wedding vision](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-to-make-an-inspiration-board)). This type of vision board is centered around the engagement, with photos of your ring, where it'll happen and other key details. Either one of you (or even both, together) can work on this mood board, or if you're the one proposing, you can work with your future spouse's loved ones to make it a surprise.

[READ MORE How to Make Your Dream Wedding Inspiration Board  ](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-to-make-an-inspiration-board)

There aren't any set rules about what a vision board absolutely has to have, but we do have some guidelines and general ideas that are easy to follow, so you're not overwhelmed. Planning your "just said yes" moment doesn't have to be daunting, especially when you have a vision board to help you visualize and know what to expect.

## What to Include on Your Proposal Vision Board 

A vision board (specifically for a proposal) requires you to consider certain elements, like the ring and overall theme. Even the most low-key proposal can benefit from a mood board, so here's what you need to add when planning things out.

### Ring Inspiration

With the world of [unique engagement ring ideas](https://www.theknot.com/content/unique-engagement-ring-ideas), what will your partner want? Maybe they've given you some choice in the matter, and you can use the vision board to narrow it down to the dream ring. You can also use multiple ideas on a mood board to work with a jeweler to create a custom design.

### Dream Location

When you picture the moment, what does the backdrop look like? This is where you'll either decide on planning a special getaway for your engagement, or even curate ideas for an at-home proposal with all the bells and whistles, like petals, candles and a celebratory menu.

### Decor and Extras

No matter the venue, having the right [proposal decor](https://www.theknot.com/content/proposal-decorations) can truly make the moment even more spectacular. Has your love always wanted a flashing neon sign asking, "Will you marry me?" Or what about their favorite flowers in bouquets around the space? The options are limitless—this is your chance to get creative.

### Overall Theme

This step may not apply to all proposals, but it's worth considering on your mood board. A cohesive theme, like a starry-night picnic or spa day at a resort, can set the tone for the engagement. Add your partner's favorite colors, places, food and more if you want something more personalized.

### Proposal Vibes

What vibes are you going for? Something intimate and simple, or something you can capture on film to share with loved ones? Keep your future spouse's personality top of mind when aiming for the right vibes, because not everyone will want a Jumbotron proposal, but they also might want their friends and family to be a part of it.

### Quotes and Phrases

Will you include any meaningful quotes or a sweet speech in your proposal? Then incorporate some of your favorites onto the mood board. This can even help you jumpstart other ideas, such as the theme or vibes.

## Tools for Making a Proposal Vision Board

Whether you want to craft a physical mood board or something digital, these apps and sites make it easy to bring that marriage proposal vision to life. And if you want to surprise your future spouse, a digital vision board is much easier to keep under lock and key.

[**Canva**](https://www.canva.com/s/templates?query=vision+board)**:** With both free and premium options, Canva is a handy resource that's user-friendly and budget-friendly. Upload your own photos or search through their selection of graphics, fonts, themes and more.

## How to Make a Proposal Vision Board

There's no right or wrong way to make a vision board, but there are some goals you'll want to achieve when creating one. Here's what you need to know when diving into this exciting endeavor.

![How to make a marriage proposal vision board](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/fd3fbe56-0a85-4370-80b8-73da5806e0a2~rs_768.h)

### Define Your Goal

While the marriage proposal may be the ultimate goal, now's the time to really nail down what you want to achieve from this big moment. Is it a private proposal with candlelight and champagne? Or something involving your loved ones and a flashy routine? This will help steer you toward the right ideas, photos and inspiration to fill your board.

### Source Inspo and Customize

Gather images either digitally or through classic methods, like magazines and old photos, or you can search your favorite celebrity's Insta post (like [Taylor Swift's proposal](https://www.theknot.com/content/taylor-swift-proposal-ideas)) to give your S.O. an unforgettable moment like their style icon. Knowing what your spouse-to-be will love is the perfect guide for sourcing the right materials for the mood board.

### Choose the Right Vision Board Tool

You can choose from the list we added above, or you can opt for something that fits your specific needs. Everyone benefits from a vision board differently, and you may already be using some software that you're used to that will make the proposal vision really pop.

### Create the Mood Board

Now that you've gathered all your materials, it's time to arrange your photos throughout your board with all the extras, from quotes to cute embellishments (especially if it's a tangible board). And now that it's all right in front of you, you may see some areas that need work or changing, like if some elements don't necessarily match up or fit the overall vibe.

### Share It With Your S.O.

You can still keep the element of surprise on your side, but giving your future bride or groom a chance to look at the overall vibe can plant some serious excitement in their mind. They may even have a few suggestions, and starting this big step in your relationship with communication sets you up for a happy future.

### Use It to Book Vendors, Travel, Etc.

Maybe you've idealized this proposal and see that you're going to need a photographer, a hotel stay or other vendors. There are plenty of engagement vendors you can work with to create this magical memory, and having all of it in front of you on the board makes planning that much simpler.

### Display It or Save

A vision board is there to help you manifest something, of course, but it's also a map of sorts to lead you where you want to go. Displaying it somewhere or keeping it on hand will be a constant reminder so that the proposal day goes as smoothly as possible.
