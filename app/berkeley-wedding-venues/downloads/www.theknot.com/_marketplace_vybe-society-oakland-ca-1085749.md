We worked with Vybe Society over two nights of our wedding. Catherine was very knowledgable and helped us understand the right package for us, and the whole team was very flexible ...

as we figured out we'd need two nights of support instead of one! The first night was actually just for a mic set up during our ceremony and some pre recorded music over dinner. It was really important to us that our guests could hear us during the ceremony and the mic and speaker set up was FLAWLESS despite being in the middle of a field! The team really figured it out and I was so grateful to not be worrying about static or the sound cutting in and out on this special day. The second night we hired them as a band and as a DJ add on! The live music was AMAZING, truly. Our guests loved it and they sounded amazing. The team was again flexible as we figured out the best set up for them in our family barn, and we feel really lucky to have worked with them. The DJ was a fun way to end the night and we all had a great time dancing. The team came out for a site visit and was easy to work with! My only advice for other couples here is I wish we had taken the time to make a specific playlist for the DJ to play, he played great songs but the hour flew by and there were some songs we wish we would have more specifically asked for. Additionally, as compared to some of our other vendors, Vybe Society sometimes took longer to get back to us during the contracting phase - but the level of service and quality of work was so great we are really grateful to have worked with them! We would highly recommend to others and also will seek out their music in the future!

On top of their talent, this company was extremely professional and easy to work with throughout the entire process, which made everything stress-free for us. We highly recommend Vybe Society to anyone looking to elevate their wedding or event with unforgettable live music to your liking. Thank you again!!

They also worked in a few special request songs into both the reception set list and ceremony backdrop. We had dozens of people tell us after the wedding that the band was amazing and a highlight of the night - we’d recommend them for any event!

It was a true 5-star experience, and we couldn’t be happier. If you're thinking about hiring Vybe Society—do it! You won’t regret it. I wish I could relive that dance floor all over again!

I hired Vybe Society to play at my wedding recently and the band was amazing! The musicians were super talented and put on a great performance. They really got the party going and ...

got all the guests out on the dancefloor. They also provided beautiful instrumentals during my ceremony and cocktail hour. I got so many compliments after the wedding on how great the band was. They truly helped to make my wedding special and unforgettable. The band management was a little difficult to communicate with in that I had to reach out to them multiple times to get a response to simple questions. This happened a few times. But honestly the band itself was so good that I'm still giving them five stars despite the fact that communication during the planning period could have been better. In the end it all worked out so well though, I would highly recommend hiring this band for your event!

We wanted our wedding day to be about music that celebrated who we are as a couple, but Vybe Society’s performance left us feeling disheartened at every turn. The ceremony began on...

a sour note—my aisle song started late, and my wife’s was both late and in the wrong section. These might sound like small mishaps, but they set a jarring tone for what came next: explicit lyrics during the grand entrance, improvised renditions of our carefully choreographed dance songs, and an abrupt end to the night that left our guests with no dance floor music at all. Initially, Vybe Society assured us everything was “doable” and took great care to collect our detailed instructions. But once the day arrived, those preparations seemed forgotten. Even more frustrating was how they handled the aftermath. While they tried to address our concerns, the gesture felt more like an attempt to quantify how much they had, in their view, “messed up”—a calculation that didn’t come close to acknowledging the emotional impact or the sheer scope of their mistakes. And when we pressed them on the extent of the damage, we were met with a sudden shift in tone that felt more accusatory than apologetic. From my perspective, the day’s biggest heartbreak was seeing my wife in tears—she had poured so much care into her song selections and dances, all for it to unravel. If we could do things again, I wouldn’t hesitate to pick a different band.

nice if you had honored your word and written an apology to our female vocalist as you stated on our call. Regardless, we wish you all the best. \----------- Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. We are truly sorry to hear that your experience with us did not meet your expectations. Our mission is always to provide exceptional service and performances that enhance our clients’ special moments, and we regret that we fell short of your hopes for your event. Regarding your request for a full refund in exchange for a five-star review, we want to address this openly. While we value every client’s satisfaction, we felt that agreeing to this would have been both dishonest and unethical. We expected that a review like this might follow, but we stand by our commitment to integrity and transparency in all our interactions. As for the event itself, we offered several recommendations based on our professional experience to help ensure the day flowed smoothly. Unfortunately, each of those recommendations was declined. As a result, what we feared might happen did in fact occur on your wedding day. Also to clarify, we never declined to play longer. We actually said we would perform a few more songs even though your event had already exceeded the venue’s contracted hard stop. However, during the performance of the first song of that set, after the venue’s designated stop time, your husband, who seemed very inebriated, came on the stage multiple times and used aggressive and profane language toward our female vocalist while she was performing. This behavior was not only deeply concerning to her but also shocking to the entire band. In light of this, we made the difficult decision to stop the live performance and transition to the recorded version of the song for safety reasons before proceeding to pack up. We understand that weddings are emotionally charged events, but the conduct we experienced was both unprecedented and unacceptable. It is regrettable that this situation unfolded the way it did. Please know that our intent was never to cause disappointment. We truly wish we could have created a better experience for you. As always, we remain committed to learning from every event to continually improve our services. We sincerely wish you and your spouse a happy marriage and all the best in the future.

By all accounts, one reading this webpage would be persuaded to hire Vybe Society for any event; indeed, the 5-star reviews certainly convinced me to hire Vybe Society for my weddi...

ng. Unfortunately, the reviews on this page, while painting a rosy picture of what happens when things go well, do not provide a complete picture of what happens when things go poorly. To be sure, that is completely understandable, as many couples may not want to relive their negative experiences by recounting them in a review. The pain of suffering through those harrowing details from my wedding day is what kept me from writing this review sooner. However, I feel compelled to offer my perspective to those who find themselves in my position now or in the future; I know personally how important it is to make informed decisions when it concerns your wedding day. Above all, it is important to find vendors who place the client’s goals and vision above all else, and who pride themselves in a professionalism and accountability towards their work. That professionalism and accountability was lacking in Vybe Society’s performance on my wedding day, and in how they have handled our interactions thereafter. Vybe Society’s blunders on my wedding day include embarrassing both my husband and me by failing to play either of our aisle songs as we began walking down the aisle; indeed, each of us was over halfway down the aisle before the band began either of our songs. For my aisle song in particular, the band failed to honor the specific clip we specified in advance, which further humiliated us as the band continued onto awkward lyrics from the song we were hoping to avoid. This happened again during our grand entrance song, when the band failed to cut the song off before explicit lyrics were shared with our guests. Making matters worse, the band did not honor the specific clips we requested for both our first and second dances as a couple, which was especially problematic as the band was informed that we had prepared choreographed dances for both; instead, the band—without informing us—elected its own version of both songs, which made it difficult for us to perform dances we had spent months rehearsing (including with our entire extended families). My husband had to plead repeatedly for the band to simply play the original track—a fact that Vybe Society later shamefully twisted around to suggest that he was inebriated. The icing on the wedding cake is that we had zero dance floor music that evening—when asked whether the band would afford us a few additional minutes of live music, they declined. Ultimately, Vybe Society’s attention to our wedding day speaks for itself; every detail that was specified in advance was missed and there was zero indication that the band had reviewed any part of the lengthy questionnaire they insisted I complete (months in advance, at that). Nor were we informed in advance that any one of those details would be challenging or infeasible; to the contrary, Vybe Society assured us that everything was doable. When we confronted Vybe Society afterwards, they refused any accountability for our wedding music, instead blaming the wind, other vendors, our guests, and me and my husband. They also offered belated excuses, such as that they advise people to use original tracks for choreographed dances (even though they actively advertise their ability to play choreographed dances live, and specifically assured me that our dances were “definitely doable”). Worse still, they insulted us when we attempted to resolve our disagreement amicably. Perhaps the biggest disappointment—one that is particularly troubling—is that the band prevented us from enjoying the moment with our people during our special day; I spent precious moments of my wedding day in tears, humiliated by the missed cues, delayed songs, and other failings of the band. If I could do it over, the band is the only thing I would change. Professionalism means to have care and attention to important details when providing a service, and, equally important, to hold oneself accountable when that work product falls below the mark. If you are looking for these qualities for your special day, Vybe Society is unlikely the right choice for you.

My wife and I got married in June and having Vybe society as our band was AWESOME! We heard them at a wedding the year before and immediately knew we wanted them at ours too. They ...

had such amazing energy and kept everyone dancing all night. Adding horns was a great decision. Erin has an INCREDIBLE voice and also emceed, she did a great job. We asked them to do Hava Nagila and they absolutely crushed it. Afterwards a friend asked for the recording because it was the best rendition she’d ever heard!

TALK ABOUT A PARTY. Thank you so much to Vybe society for absolutely CRUSHING it at our wedding. We had a really hard time picking a band, youtube and website videos can only do ...

so much! We are music lovers who really wanted people grooving and rocking out all night and Vybe Society did just that and MORE. The dance floor was absolutely electric! We had the opportunity to talk about our music taste and our vision for the night prior but when it came down to it, the band was totally reading the room and giving the people what they wanted in the moment and we couldn't have asked for anything better. Thank you to Catherine and Lisa for being so easy to work with on the logistics side. Thank you to the band for sharing your incredible talent with us and for putting on such an epic show. We feel so blessed and will never forget you. I will be recommending Vybe Society to everyone and anyone.

We couldn't have asked for a better band for our wedding in Carmel, CA this past February than Vybe Society! They were truly the highlight of our special day, and each one of our g...

uests is still singing their praises. From the moment they started playing, they had everyone on the dance floor all night long. The female vocalists, Mickala and Erin, are absolute powerhouses. Their voices added an incredible energy and emotion to every song they performed. And Catherine, the manager, was an absolute pleasure to work with. She was organized, professional, and made the entire process seamless. Vybe Society is not just a band; they are a group of incredibly talented and synchronized musicians who know how to keep the party going. Their ability to read the crowd and play the perfect songs at the perfect moments is unmatched. We would highly recommend Vybe Society to anyone looking for a band for their wedding or any other special event. In fact, our friends are already looking to book them for their upcoming weddings! Thank you, Vybe Society, for making our wedding night unforgettable.

Together with Catherine and the rest of his team the whole process was effortless and stress-free. We had several special requests he accommodated effortlessly and boy did the band keep the party going. If you need a killer band for your wedding or corporate event, look no further than Vybe Society! Looking forward to hearing Vybe Society at one of their gigs to rekindle the memory!

Hiring Vybe Society may have been the best decision we made for our wedding (other than saying "I do" of course). Having been to many weddings I had always noticed the difference...

on the dance floor and with the wedding energy between a live band and a DJ. While there's no doubt you will save some money with a DJ, a great live band will likely be the highlight of the evening or even weekend. There are a lot of wedding bands out there, but none compare to Vybe Society. At least none in Northern California. Having worked at a live music venue and booked bands, I can confidently say that Vybe Society has the talent to do anything that artists on the Billboard Top 100 do. In case you still haven't reached out to Vybe Society here are a couple more reasons... 1) They are willing to learn just about anything you ask and it made our first dance so much more special. 2) The variety in configurations the offer, from small standard set ups to entire horn sections is so nice. 3) Day of they were professional, super easy to work with, and so gracious to our guests the whole night. Be careful, this band is busy and does book up. Make sure you get your date scheduled and be patient as the weeks lead up to the special day. Just know that everything, even what may seem like a pretty penny, will be worth it ten times over. While I don't plan on getting married again, I will be suggesting Vybe Society to family, friends, co-workers, and anyone that needs some event entertainment. I hope to have another opportunity to work with them in the future.

nergy kept the dancefloor going all night, and many of our guests came to us afterwards to tell us how amazing the band was. Not only were they great performers, but they were a pleasure to work with as well. Catherine was super helpful coordinating before the event. The band took my long unorganized list of requests and arranged them into 3 beautifully crafted sets. They were very accommodating to my special requests as well. Elijah helped set up a mic and sound for a song I had prepared as a surprise for my bride, and they let me sit in with the band as well! Dale did a great job of MC’ing our toasts, and they were all fantastic guests all around. We also booked the string quartet through Vybe Society. There could not have been a better accompaniment for our ceremony. Their repertoire was a great mix of classical and covers of various genres, which brought an element of fun to the classiness of the string quartet. Their timing of songs with the ceremony really brought it to the next level! I cannot recommend Vybe Society enough! They are a shoo in for the best wedding band in The Bay!

What we loved so much about them is that they felt like real musicians, jamming and playing great music instead of a "wedding band" phoning it in as it sadly can feel like at times. We booked Vybe and immediately they became one of our most detailed, responsive, thoughtful, and professional vendors. But the day of the wedding was where they SHINED. They brought such energy, joy, and incredible music to our wedding. I cannot thank the band enough. I would HIGHLY recommend them. They are GIFTED musicians, true professionals, and an incredible deal. I can't recommend them more highly!!

She was also easily reached (not true for every vendor) by phone or email and very responsive which made me feel better. I do have to say that when everything was said and done, our entire wedding party was in AWE of the fantastic job the band did. They played through the evening and were truly spectacular with every song. I wasn’t particularly picky about any songs but guests did get their requests played which they really enjoyed. As an out of state bride in medical school, this was truly a delightful experience to plan due to their ease of scheduling, quick questionnaire, and responsiveness when needed. Thank you again to our amazing strings trio and the entire Vybe Society team! A million praises for your musicians!!

Society. Vybe was extremely professional and responsive (a stark contrast to the band we had initially hired) - even when working under such a short time crunch. My now-husband and I are kind of music snobs; we both love music and he has been a singer/musician his whole life. The musicians in Vybe were truly amazing and so talented! The style and mix of musical genres was exactly what we were looking for and we danced the night away with all of our guests. The band even let us steal the mic at the end of the night for us to sing a final song together for our guests. I highly recommend Vybe Society!

Vybe Society included special details unique to us that made the experience outstanding. The band incorporated our name in the songs and even small details from the speeches. We were absolutely blown away! Every single song they played had the whole wedding on the dance floor - in fact the dance floor was overflowing and people were dancing in the grass. It was the dance party of our dreams. Our wedding would not have been the same without them. They were the talk of the night and we could not have been more happy about that.

VYBE has the groove retention tactics in full effect. They bring the heat. They did a great job playing specific song requests that we made in advance, particularly the songs that ...

were played when my wife and I walked down the aisle--including vocals! Catherine, the event coordinator, was incredible. So kind, responsive, and accommodating. My only two critiques are that their sets seemed short. I would have liked to have gotten more music from them. And I was disappointed that they were unable to play a song I requested during our reception that I thought would have been a guarantee because I put it on our pre-questionnaire, and it is a song (Learn How to Love You by TTB) that is on their own list of songs that is supposed to be within their repertoire.
