Monte Verde Inn is a wedding venue located in Foresthill, CA. The venue’s team believes in a collaborative approach to planning meant to ensure a wedding that highlights your character and personality. This property has a sophisticated quality that presents an ideal surrounding for a romantic day. Located on a ridge in central California, the town of Foresthill was once a hub for miners who were looking to strike it rich during the Gold Rush. This remote town provides stunning views of the Sierra Nevada Mountains but remains an easily commutable distance to larger towns and cities like Sacramento. The many nearby lakes and rivers can provide a peaceful adventure for your out-of-town guests. The staff at the Monte Verde Inn wants to invite couples to showcase their personal style among their six acres of enchanting forests. A truly natural setting, the feeling of romance is abundant from first glance. A canopy comprised of varying types of native foliage creates an intimate space to exchange vows while your guests look on lovingly. Manicured gardens with gently flowing fountains become serene backdrops for your most cherished portraits. The building’s interior boasts a series of large picture windows which flood the event space with natural light. The classic character of this room’s intricate millwork and beautiful chandelier harken back to days gone by. It sets the stage for a night of dancing and mingling that won’t soon be forgotten. The Georgian Manor House built in 1939, has a facade of white siding with black shutters that somehow strikes a balance between quaint and stately. The premises have the ability to host weddings of up to 250 guests for outdoor events and up to 80 guests for indoor events. Monte Verde strives to make your wedding planning experience as seamless as possible. As a result, they offer comprehensive wedding packages that can help to ease your mind and reduce wedding-day stress. Get-ready rooms, setup and teardown of your event, and day-of coordination are all available through this venue. They can provide decorations and tableware to complement your style.

We are so glad that we booked Monte Verde Inn for our wedding! The venue was absolutely stunning and the food was delicious. Our coordinator, Kailyn, was also great. She took over ...

coordination services after MVI went through several coordinators in quick succession. The repeated changing of coordinators was stressful, but it worked out in the end and we were very happy to be working with Kailyn. We would definitely recommend Monte Verde Inn!

Sydney was able to organize a flawless ceremony, while reassuring us, and pivoting our seating arrangements from outdoor to indoor in a matter of minutes. The food was AMAZING. The staff was so kind and were so helpful to all of our guests who kept remarking what a fairytale location it is. You do not want to miss out.

orried about planning a wedding up in NorCal while living in SoCal but I believe we chose the perfect venue to do it with. The venue is beautiful and mostly all inclusive with is very helpful when planning from afar as I had to do much less by myself. The venue includes catering, alcohol, cake, reception florals and so much more. The only vendors I had to hire separately were a dj and photographer, and the venue even has recommendations for those vendors which was so helpful. I TOTALLY recommend Monte Verde Inn for your wedding, Sydney and the staff are so kind, helpful, organized, and committed to making your special day one to remember.

I came to Alicia in a complete panic last year because our original venue had cancelled on us 5 months out from our originally scheduled date. Even in a pandemic, she worked with u...

s through every hurdle and change to still have our special day as close to the way we envisioned it as possible, and she stayed a voice of calm and optimism the whole time. Right before walking down the aisle, when I was losing my patience with my photographer and my bridesmaids, she was the one who reminded me to take a breath, remember why I was here, and be in the present when getting to finally marry my husband. The venue is gorgeous, intimate, inclusive, and easy to access, but Alicia is really what made the wedding process fun and easy. She was on top of everything, very responsive, flexible, accommodating, and sweet. She was also amazing about keeping my vendors in line and always following my wishes, not my vendors. We are having an anniversary party/reception there later this year, and I cannot wait to work with Alicia again!

We fell in love with this venue, and were initially treated very well. Unfortunately, we had to cancel, due to unforeseen circumstances, and then it all changed! We cancelled, unde...

rstanding that we would get our $5,000 deposit back if another couple booked our date. We reached out to Alicia and her response was that unless someone were to choose our original date, we were out of luck and should not expect any kind of refund. I questioned how we could be at fault in that a global pandemic hit, but could not get any clear answer. The bottom line is, if someone was unable to take our date, due to the pandemic or otherwise, we had no recourse, and would forfeit our deposit. We accepted the fact that we canceled pre pandemic and tried to make it right by explaining that we would forfeit $1,000 as a cancellation fee. Alicia became very uncooperative. She told us she would contact us for a time to talk, but it would be over a month before we could began our dialog again. We tried to resolve this, but could not get any kind of reasonable agreement. She and Monte Verde Inn would do NOTHING more than just take our deposit and wash their hands of us. They made no effort to make a good faith refund, of any kind. This has truly been an eye opener for us especially during these hard times. We are sad that this venue and the couples interested in the property are being dealt with this way.

MVI gave us the best day ever. Everything was absolutely perfect! Lexi is the mastermind behind it all and she ensures everything runs smoothly and she really thinks of everything ...

down to the smallest of details. She is very easy to communicate with and was honestly there every step of the way, including the entire day/night of our wedding. We live out of state so the fact that they take care of most everything helped immensely. The venue is beautiful and intimate. We got married at the end of August and my biggest concern was the heat. It was a warm day, but by the time the ceremony it had really cooled down and was not bad at all. We still can’t stop talking about the day and we are so glad we chose MVI! Thank you Lexi & the entire staff!!

kes all the stress away from the couple. We were engaged for a little over a year and we were constantly asked by family and friends "oh my god aren't you stressed out??.. (annoyed face)."I can honestly say as the bride I was not and I am an overplanning kind of person. The coordinator Lexi and her staff have everything down to the exact minute and down to every single detail. Many details are taken care of for you and all you and your partner simply need to do is choose your details and then show up(cake detail, cake flavors, linens, all food, all bar drinks, florist for centerpieces, servers etc. ALL DONE FOR YOU) It was so nice! The only vendors we had to hire on our own were photographer/photobooth, videographer and DJ (all of which Lexi provides recommendations.) And the food was really good which is definitely a plus. We need to give a special shoutout to the wedding planner and day of coordinator Lexi. She is AMAZING. She is awesome at communicating and providing honest feedback and opinions of what she thinks couples actually need versus what they see on pinterest that would cause a lot more work. She is VERY detailed oriented and thinks of so many things before the couple even does. On the day of she does an amazing job running the night and is always in the right spot at the right time holding exactly what it is that you are looking for. Monte Verde is definitely worth the money. It is nicely tucked away off of Foresthill road. You feel like you are out of town getting married in a magical forest covered in twinkle lights but in reality you are about 20 minutes out of town. I also loved that everything was at one location (ceremony, reception, getting ready, etc.) The house itself is beautiful and has a lot of vintage traditional details that are to die for. There is also an inside ballroom that can be used in case of rain or in colder seasons. We felt like our wedding was a movie. Everything went perfect and everything was so beautiful! I wish we could re-live the night over and over again!!

for our special day. I cannot describe how painless the planning process was with Lexi (coordinator). Everything is laid out very plainly and you can decide from there. But it is also as customizable as you could want. She is flexible and accommodating when need be, to ensure your wedding is exactly how you want it. The way they do their pricing makes it easy to understand where your money is going and the prices are very reasonable for what you are getting. The food was excellent. The cake from Divine Desserts was incredible, honestly the best cake I've ever had. People raved and almost all of it got eaten! The flowers were gorgeous. Everything turned out better than what I had anticipated. It was a completely stress-free day for me, I am sure thanks to Lexi's hard work at keeping any issues away from me. There is nothing I would change about their process, it truly guarantees you have the wedding of your dreams.

Do the research, find the right people and let them handle it. We found the right place with Monte Verde Inn and Alexis Winblad. Part of Lexi's magic is having great vendors to refer people to. Trust the preferred vendor list!! Everything was perfect!!! Thank you for an absolutely magical wedding day!!! Beth & Paul Vergnani

She is extremely organized, and As the biggest control freak ever I felt 100000% comfortable leaving everything in her control. She made the day run SEAMLESSLY . I truly appreciate that the coordinators work hard to make us a priority day of wedding and they make sure everyone knows it! :) from things as small as going to get us drinks from the bar so we didn’t have to leave the dance floor, to putting my vans sneakers on when the heels became too much. The wedding and venue were MORE than we could have dreamed of. We love and appreciate you guys. \- the Bini’s

the inn to the vineyard, oak tree and barn in the back. It's so naturally beautiful that very little extra decor is needed, and if you're not super crafty like me, that was a plus. The staff sets up everything so tastefully and Martha, who does their flowers, is amazing. She can do anything. The servers were very professional. I honestly didn't notice they were there! Lexi and Ali were amazing coordinators. I'm pretty sure they have experienced just about everything and know how to handle anything. They were essential in ensuring our wedding ran smoothly. I literally did not worry about one thing during the whole event. My husband and I highly recommend Monte Verde Inn for its gorgeous venue and professional and highly experienced staff. We received so many compliments on how beautiful the wedding was. It was more perfect than I could have ever envisioned. I truly cannot say enough good things about Monte Verde Inn.

impression. We heard great things about Tina so we were a little worried when we found out we’d have a different coordinator. Lexi ended up being an amazing coordinator, even before meeting in person I could tell she was going to do a great job! She’s very organized and has a lot of experience and great advice. The fact that the venue is all inclusive was sooooo nice. It was great not having to coordinate with a bunch of different vendors for the cake, food, table rentals, dinnerware, etc. Both Lexi and Ali were there for the big day and everything was so wonderful and stress free! It was so great just being able to relax while getting ready and not have to set anything up or worry about last minute things. Lexi and Ali came and checked on us a few time throughout the day and made sure that we were eating and staying hydrated. I highly recommend Monte Verde, it was perfect and I wish we could experience it all over again!

use she soon took over as the coordinator. She was wonderful and the whole experience made wedding planning so much easier! Communication with Lexi was easy and she understood all of our wants/needs for the perfect wedding. We used many of the preferred vendors and it made for a flawless night. Many of our 100 guests commented on how beautiful the ceremony was and that the reception was very enjoyable (free booze probably helped- we opted for the Open Bar, which was another great decision). And although no one had control of the weather, the venue provides guests with a ceremony/reception set at optimal times... it turned out to be a great temperature! The setting was gorgeous and for being all-inclusive, Monte Verde Inn is actually a reasonable price when compared to other venues in the area. Overall, Monte Verde was the best decision for us, which led to the perfect wedding!

We knew we wanted an outdoor ceremony and reception venue within reasonable driving distance from Sacramento, California (easily accessible by car, plane, and even train for our gu...

ests). Set in the foothills, Foresthill is a lovely escape from city hustle. I was confident in its professionalism as many of my initial questions were readily answered on the website. Kudos to the owners for hiring Lexi to oversee wedding coordination not to mention sales and marketing. Honestly, it's too much for one person. Packages and pricing delivered great value for decor, tables/chairs & silverware, catering, and especially (setup, clean up) labor. The list of recommended vendors (DJ, photographer, florists, baker) gave us options to find talented individuals who better understood our goals and budget, as well as fit our personalities... and were experienced at working with Lexi and maximizing the advantages of a wedding at Monte Verde Inn. I also loved the intimacy of the estate: the ceremony site under a canopy of evergreens is steps away from the reception site with lawns, cocktail patio and ornamental trees. The front of the inn, front lawn and fountain are ideal for group photos; they provide more visual variety for pictures that capture your special day. Behind the ceremony site, photographers also know to creatively employment vineyards, the red barn and more forested areas to make details more sentimental to the couple (and wedding party members). Special thanks to Lexi for her "tough love" comments during rehearsal to make sure everybody understood their role on game day! The most distinct aspect of a wedding, here, is the 10 minutes deliberately set aside after the ceremony -- so bride and groom spend time together exclusively, sip bubbly and grab bites to eat. We knew the day would pass quickly; MVI purposefully making time for just us was my favorite aspect of planning (and important for my husband to check his blood sugar to manage his diabetes).

autiful grounds, and amazing staff. We had a smallish wedding, with about 50 close family and friends. The wedding was a great success, thanks to the staff at Monte Verde Inn, especially Lexi. Lexi was very attentive to details, and understanding of our needs. The wedding day can be very busy and stressful, but Lexi took charge and kept everyone on task. She watched out for us, and our needs and coordinated everything, and everyone perfectly. Having an onsite wedding coordinator, like Lexi, at an all inclusive venue is the best decision we made. Alexis is calm and collected, but takes charge and get things done when needed. She has many years of experience, and was always ready with an answer or solution when needed. We had many little unique details at my wedding, and it was executed as we had wished. Her advise and personality got us through without any issues. Thank you Lexi, you were amazing, keep rocking!!! We will be eternally grateful.

We had an absolutely amazing experience getting married at Monte Verde in May. The venue is beautiful and in the spring everything is blooming and adds to the beauty of the venue. ...

We did both our ceremony and reception outside and we loved it. Food is included in the package as well as the cake and reception flowers. When we signed our contract with the inn, they had a different coordinator. About 10 months before our wedding, we were informed that the coordinator would now be Lexi. Initially, we were nervous but Lexi made the transition seamless. She was a big part of the reason that our wedding was so wonderful. She helped us so much leading up to the wedding and answered all our questions. Her and her assistant Ali helped make sure our wedding day went smoothly. They checked on us throughout the night, made sure we were fine with the timing, and made sure we were having fun! My husband and I were able to relax and enjoy our wedding instead of worrying about anything.

While the pricing might initially seem a little high, it's important to realize that it includes the venue, food, nonalcoholic drinks, decor, decor flowers, high quality staff and service, and, of course, the amazing Lexi. It is well worth it. During our planning period, Lexi took over as our coordinator and blew us away with all that she did for us. Lexi quickly assured us that we were in good hands.

The food was incredible, everyone raved about it. The bartenders were so friendly, and all the final touches were set exactly as we wanted. My food allergies were dealt with so well, and each little ask made to seem as though it was nothing. Kelsey and the entire staff thought of everything. Most of the time we never knew they were there, but the moment we needed anything before we could even ask they were on hand and taking care of us.

We really wanted to give Monte Verde Inn 5 stars, don't get me wrong. This venue is GORGEOUS to say the least. When we toured this place with Tina last year we were blown away. Tin...

a is seriously so amazing how can we not have our wedding here?! So,of course, we decided to have our wedding here. Literally everything went smoothly until about 3 weeks prior to our wedding. Yeah, that's right THREE weeks! That's when everything went crumbling down and FAST! We found out that Tina had decided to move on from the venue and quite honestly, I do not blame her. When we met with the new coordinator she was bashing on Tina and told us lies. Tina has been very sweet to us and when Lexi told us some unnecessary things we were definitely put in an awkward position. Lexi is very unprofessional and if we had toured with her in the very beginning, we wouldn't have come back. Also, she had told me that she wasn't able to be at our wedding rehearsal and asked us to move our rehearsal to the DAY OF our wedding. I didn't even know what to say to that. Oh and on top of that, she was also going to "bounce around 6pm" (her words) so she can go to her best friend's bachelorette party, but told us not to worry because "anyone can coordinate a wedding." Her exact words. Also, she lied to us about her being the manager and writes her own checks. We wanted to talk to someone above her to let them know what's going on because this was a little much for me. She refused to let us through to management, but my friend ended up being able to contact him. We talked to Raj, the owner, to let him know what is going on because we paid way too much for this to all happen last minute!! He pretty much ignored what is going on and proceeds to say negative things about Tina. I am sorry but if you have a problem with your previous employees or present, you DO NOT say it to your clients! It's so unprofessional. Anyway, we ended up with Martha, who is their florist to be our wedding coordinator. She is the sweetest lady ever! Absolutely loved her! The staff was great. Everything day of was fine. We never got to eat our cake and usually they box it up for us but I'm sure with things that happened prior to our wedding day, they could care less and wanted us out. It's seriously a beautiful venue and food was great, but the people running this place really need to step back and really think about how the present themselves. I've been in customer service pretty much all my life since my parents owns a business and I was astonished by how these people talk to their clients. I had emailed Nick, the manager, to thank him for the day and also wanted to let him know that his staff were wonderful. No response back. Shocker right? I have so many mixed feelings about this place. I seriously wished that we had Tina for our wedding day, she's seriously the best and this venue definitely lost their best employee. I've also talked to some of the staff members after and some are considering the same. By the way, Raj is the new owner of this venue and he had taken over half way through last year's wedding season so this is his first full year with wedding season. I seriously hope for the best, this venue is too gorgeous.

If you choose this venue or you are on the fence, just know that it is such a fun process working with Tina and her staff from start to finish, and you won't be disappointed! Also, if you can, I highly recommend renting the inn overnight!

We do not have enough good things to say about our experience planning and implementing our August 2016 wedding with the Monte Verde Inn in Foresthill, California. To be honest, ou...

r decision to even tour MVI stemmed mostly from seeing their delicious menu options on their website. Our tour was the Monday before Christmas and Tina, the lead wedding coordinator and really the face of the Monte Verde Inn, greeted us outside in the pouring, freezing rain. Even in the storm you could feel Tina’s warmth, and we couldn’t help but fall in love with the venue. It’s so beautiful and has a little bit of something for everyone, including the Inn itself, the garden, vineyard, fountain, and red barn. From the moment we decided to sign the contract until our departure the morning after the wedding, everything was smooth and easy. We never second guessed our decision to have our wedding there, even when we learned that the business had been sold to another owner shortly after we booked with them. You couldn’t tell the difference. Tina always communicated clearly and patiently, and the vendors they contract with are top notch. And even though Tina was too sick to work on our actual wedding day, we completely trusted the staff – especially Tina’s assistant, Lexi – to make sure the day was amazing. The Open House was a good thing to attend before our planning appointment because it really helped us narrow down our food choices (there are so many). Needless to say, it really paid off on the wedding day: so many of our guests stated that their meal (spring greens with raspberry vinaigrette, prime rib, stuffed chicken, asparagus with pancetta, fingerling potatoes, and mushroom risotto) was the best wedding meal they ever had – and it was served buffet style! Part of booking with MVI means that your linens, utensils, chairs and tables, wedding cake and decorative floral (except the arch and personal flowers) is included with your main package. This means you have fewer vendors to seek out independently, which is awesome and reduces the planning stress big time! Cathy with Gimmie Cake Too (cake baker) did such a great job. We enjoyed our cake tasting and trusted her explicitly, and the staff at MVI said they had never seen cake disappear so quickly! Martha with Blooms by Martha (decorative floral) really listened to our vision and brought it to life. Our friends couldn’t stop taking pictures of the floral arrangements! We also used MVI’s preferred DJ, Joe Kalamaras (SJ’s DJ) and boy, was that a smart choice! We LOVE Joe. We also chose one of MVI’s recommended photographers, Jessica Roman (Jessica Roman Photography), and that beautiful and wonderful woman became this bride’s saving grace. Talk about a wedding dream team!!! We strongly recommend Monte Verde Inn as your Gold Country wedding venue, especially if you are a couple wanting your special day to be beautiful, stress free, and memorable. We wish we could get married there every weekend!

Tina and the team at the Monte Verde Inn were such a help to us in preparing for our wedding day. We live in Los Angeles, so planning a wedding from afar was a bit of a challenge -...

it was important to us to find a venue that was all-inclusive so we could cut down on coordination with numerous service providers. Tina helped us coordinate music, provided all of the food (which was so good, by the way!), handled the open bar, received and put up all of our decorations for us, and did all set up/take down for the event. On top of everything, the Inn is unbelievably beautiful. I work in historic preservation and my (now-husband) works with plants, so we wanted a historic building located in a forest-like setting.. and we found EXACTLY that in the Inn! The location is unbelievably stunning and the setting is beautiful. We were up in the air about having our reception indoors or out (because they can do either) but we got hit with a hailstorm on the day-of and the weather gods chose for us. (that's the price we pay trying to beat the wedding rush by getting married in mid-April.) Tina and her team were so accommodating. They provided umbrellas, set up chairs just for our elderly guests outdoors for the ceremony right before so they wouldn't be wet, and moved everything inside last-minute. We are so lucky that we found the Monte Verde Inn! I cannot recommend them enough. They are absolute pros and can handle ANYTHING!

The Monte Verde Inn was the first and only venue that my now-husband and I looked at. We had found it online and seen all sorts of photos and as soon as we saw it in person we knew...

we didn't need to look anywhere else. My coworker had also gotten married there and spoke very highly of her experience. It is an absolutely beautiful place. The big beautiful redwood trees to provide a canopy over the outdoor ceremony site/dancefloor had me swooning. There are so many different background options for photos too. From the vineyard, to the beautiful old inn, to the fountain, to the tree lined path, and so many more. Kelly and her team at the MVI are so wonderful to work with. She is an absolute professional and I felt completely comfortable in her hands. She is quick to respond to emails and happily answered any and all questions I had. Working within our somewhat modest budget was never an issue either. She takes away the need for a wedding planner, especially a day-of-coordinator - which is a huge cost-saver and stress reliever. Everything that is included in the cost - dinner, cake, drinks, chairs and tables, table linens, most of the flowers, etc. make it a great value. It may sound more expensive, initially, but when you add up the cost of getting all of those things from individual vendors (especially unforeseen costs like cake serving or having a plated dinner vs buffet), you realize you are saving a lot of money, and a lot of hassle! Which is exactly what I wanted, so that I could stay as stress-free as possible! The day of the wedding couldn't have run more smoothly. I didn't have to worry about a thing! And someone from her team was always there to make sure I had anything I needed, from a sip of water, to a glass of champagne :) And the food! Kelly's husband, Doug, is a professional chef and cooks the best wedding food you will ever taste! We received so many compliments on what a beautiful, magical, wonderful wedding it was and we couldn't agree more!

Of course it would rain on my wedding day! :) Only making our knot tighter! Working with Kelly at Monte Verde Inn was easy and fun! She actually spoke to you like a normal perso...

n and didnt sugar coat anything! As the bride everyone is afraid to tell you "No" or give you any bad news but Kelly gave it to me straight. The day before my wedding she was watching the weather, she pulled me and my new husband aside and gave us the plan B. We had planned for an outside ceremony and reception but that wasnt looking like it was going to happen. She knew how bad we wanted to get married outside under her beautiful arbor and great big redwood trees that she held out hope and still set up for an outside ceremony. We knew an outside reception was out of the picture due to the rain that was forecast-ed. Luckily the rain stopped for the ceremony and we even got some sun that peaked out. It lasted until the dinner was served so thank you weather and thank you Kelly and the Monte Verde Inn team for making everything go smoothly. Now we planned for an outside reception but let me tell you that reception inside was amazing! We were all warm and the inn was set up beautifully! All the flowers from the ceremony outside were brought in and filled the Inn with color and life. The lighten was romantic and Kelly and her team set up the tables perfectly. I love this venue and the Monte Verde Inn Team. The bar tenders were a crack up and all the guests liked talking to them. Rain or Shine this is the most beautiful venue!!! Thanks again Monte Verde Inn!! Especially Kelly and Lindsay!

As soon as my now husband popped the question we started looking for venues as we knew the great ones would go by fast. We made an appointment with Kelly and booked the same day. ...

Monte Verde was everything we were looking for, beautiful vineyard, garden, natural pavillon. It was perfect. I knew when planning my wedding I did not want to be a stressed bride. We loved that Monte Verde inn was inclusive - cake, food, linens, drinks, wedding coordination all included. Trust me that takes a lot of the stress out. What's nice about this inclusive venue is that you do not get a cookie cutter wedding. Everything is individualized. You get to choose everything about your day. Kelly and Lindsay are here to help you a long the way. We have no regrets choosing this venue. The venue itself is beautiful - perfect for pictures. And also Kelly bakes the cake. My husband is lactose and gluten intolerant and she made two different cakes so that he could have his own cake. Both were out of this world! Mike could not stop eating it after the cake cutting. Kelly and Her crew are amazing. Words cannot express my gratitude to Monte Verde Inn. They really delivered the storybook wedding we envisioned.

My wife and I chose to be married at The Monte Verde Inn, in large part, because they are extremely LGBTQ friendly! What we were hoping for was an affirmative marriage equality wed...

ding venue where we could start our new life together as wife and wife with our family and friends in attendance. What we got was so much more and beyond our expectations. Choosing the Monte Verde Inn is among the top best decisions we have ever made and were married there in May of 2014. We knew, from the moment we met with Kelly, that we were truly working with the best of the best. Our guests continue to remark on the perfection of our special day, from the gorgeous design of the venue itself, the stunning mountain greenery that surrounds the estate, the detail on each table, the work of art in the cake and the superb, five stars worthy cuisine prepared by the incredibly gifted chef, Douglas Dalisa. You will not experience such exquisite food at any other wedding venue in our experience. Each of these could easily stand on their own merit for a review, but combined, they are simply perfection. Kelly and her team did not miss a single detail in the creation of our dream wedding…and I mean, NOT A SINGLE DETAIL! I could write pages on this without exaggeration. Kelly and her team took our vision as outlined in the planning meeting and turned it into an incredible fairytale-like reality. Our vision for the alter decorations was delivered to perfection with fabric cascading onto the steps beside us. The event was planned and fulfilled well beyond our hopes and expectations as was the entire design and timing sequence of the event. We did not have to worry or think about a single thing on our wedding day, except for the joy and happiness we felt. The entire day unfolded with precision and dedication to flawless and meticulous beauty and grace. Kelly and her team were there to assist us and guide us through the entire event. In fact, at the end of our event, as we changed into our honeymoon clothes and the guests waited downstairs to wish us farewell, we realized we had forgotten to assign someone to drive our car from the lot to the front of the estate (gasp!) and without skipping a beat, Kelly stated that she had it handled and like magic, the car did indeed await us as we descended down the stairs and made our way off! Incredible! We are unable to express enough words of appreciation and recommendation about the Monte Verde Inn. Absolute professionals! We very highly recommend The Monte Verde Inn!

My husband and I just got married here a week ago, 4/21, and it was AMAZING. Kelly and her staff took such good care of us. They realized the day before that with the weather being...

so hot in April that it would be a good idea to move the dinner outside and were able to give their professional opinions on things like that and it really made the day perfect. Had we been inside it probably would have been too hot, but with the large umbrells they utilized to keep the outside tables shaded we had the perfect dinner. Kelly was so attentive to have flip-flops ready for me when we had to walk all around the property to take our pictures, and had bug bite cream ready (and it was applied without me even having to ask!) for when I ended up with a mosquito bite that itched. The Food was AMAZING, as was the cake-- which was one of my favorite parts of this venue. I have been to too many weddings where the food has come out cold, over cooked, or dry- none of those problems here. They have such a beautiful venue, whether you are looking for an outdoors wedding or an indoors venue. The ballroom is gorgeous with a romantic chandelier and large windows and the arch way outside makes for the most beautiful ceremony location. Our guests raved about the food all evening. Finally, one of the parts that makes the wedding planning easy is that Monte Verde really does take care of so many of the little details (tables, linens, set up and take down, the catering, the cake, the table flowers, the alcohol, etc) that it made the wedding planning process much easier.

If she doesn't agree with what you want to do she will end up convincing you why her way is right. There were a few times during the wedding that I wish I had stuck to my guns on a few things. Nearest "nice" hotel is the holiday inn and they do not offer any sort of shuttle service, you will have to coordinate transportation services on your own if you want it.

sals efficiency, the incredible cuisine and truly personal attention at every step of the way, Monte Verde Inn is real gem. Absolute professionals! Thank you especially to the 'master of ceremonies' Kelly Dalisa. She listens to your requests and executes them with absolute perfection. Her entire staff, especially Megan ( who was on hand the entire time) and the calm and cool Lindsey are phenomenal. The venue, let me just say, magical! It was the perfect combination of a charming B&B, a mountain sanctuary and an enchanted forest! The grounds are perfectly manicured and make for outstanding photographs! The gorgeous grove of trees that the ceremony took place in was straight out if a fairy tale. One of the best things about Monte Verde inn, besides the staff was the 'all inclusive' feeling it provided. For a bride to sit down at one meeting and decide on the cake, center pieces, food, table linens, cocktails, wine list and then some, was a dream come true. Kelly was so accommodating and very flexible. Her husband, the talented chef even let me create my own halibut dish....which brings me now to...the FOOD! The chef, Doug, Kelly's talents husband is a genius. Every last morsel of food was exquisitely presented, flavorful and absolutely delicious. I am a bit of a 'foodie' and boy was I impressed! The duck egg roles ( my personal favorite) and the freshest raw seafood bar were some of the highlights from cocktail hour. The main dishes were perfectly cooked and unbelievably delicious! For people who truly appreciate good food, this is a winner for you!! The wedding cake (designed by no other than Kelly) was gorgeous and so divine! Every last bit of the meal was perfection. I would also not have done without the talented and incredible 'preferred vendors' that Monte Verde Inn recommended. The partnership between Rebecca Ford-Ford Family Photography, Joe Kalamaras-SJ's Disk Jokey and O'Shays florist made for a truly seamless day. I highly recommend every single one of these talented vendors and thank them very much. If I could get married all over again I wouldn't think twice about choosing Monte Verde Inn. It was a dream come true, a perfectly magical evening that I will treasure forever. Thank you to the entire staff at Monte Verde Inn for a perfect wedding!

tiful nestled in the foothills east of Sacramento. Surrounded by trees, the reception area is always shaded in the evenings. We had the misfortune of having our wedding during a heatwave, but even so by the time the guests needed to be seated, the shade had moved into place and the heat was quickly dropping. The inn itself is beautiful and its ballroom is an excellent location for a morning after breakfast before heading out. It is an inn and you can renting the rooms as part of the wedding package. This helped us a lot with removing any rush from the end of the evening and breakfast afterwards was excellent. We had a number of people from out of state in our wedding party and putting them up there helped reduce the cost and trouble for them considerably. The inn has a tasting every year where you get to sample all the food and hors d’oeuvres. The food is amazing and it was hard to pick our favorite. They also handle the wedding cakes and we look forward to defrosting ours next year and having some more. Kelly, the owner, was very helpful and worked closely with us to make sure our event turned out the way we wanted it as well as making sure we stayed on track with our preparations. Her team had excellent coordination and made sure things went smoothly. Any problems we might have had were dealt with promptly and professionally. After the wedding when we returned from our honeymoon, I found out that that my parents had left a set of keys and a spare suit at the inn and they graciously shipped them back to my parents.
