Where to start? Masara and her team were truly the most incredible, talented, sweet, and kind people I could have asked for on my wedding day. As someone who doesn’t normally wear ...

a lot of makeup, I was really nervous about how I would look on my day. Masara completely exceeded any and all expectations - my makeup looked perfect, better than I could have imagined. Elevated, glowy, bridal, and natural, all at the same time. Not only did she do an amazing job with my makeup, but she was such a calming and reassuring presence for me. I was jittery and nervous all morning, but she helped me feel comforted and calm. It’s so clear to me that she is in the exact right profession - a truly talented artist in every way! My entire bridal party, my mom and mother in law were all in love with how they looked that day - and that is saying a lot because a lot of them are hard to please! Just a testament to the incredible talent of Masara and her team - I can’t thank you, Maddie, Jules, and Lupita enough for being such an important part of my perfect day!

I have never felt more beautiful than I did on my wedding day and it’s all thanks to Masara!! I felt like a princess all day because of how beautiful my makeup looked and how confi...

dent it made me feel. Masara also did my spray tan for the weekend which turned out perfect. I felt like I was glowing all day and it looked equally amazing in the photos as it did in person. My maids of honor, mom, and mother in law also absolutely loved their makeup and all looked so incredible. Masara is not only incredibly talented but extremely kind and professional. From the make up and spray tan trials to the actual wedding weekend, she was so calm and was such a great presence to have around while getting ready for the wedding. I highly recommend booking Masara if you want to look and feel your absolute best on your wedding day! Thank you so much Masara!

ailed it. Every single one of us felt so confident, beautiful, and taken care of. My bridesmaids couldn’t stop raving about how perfect their hair and makeup turned out—it was everything we hoped for and more. We were getting compliments from guests all day long, and the makeup stayed flawless well into the night. My sister even woke up the next morning still in full glam… and she looked amazing (LOL). And my mom, who normally isn’t big on makeup, looked stunning and genuinely felt beautiful. She’s already dreaming up a party just so Masara can come back and do a makeup lesson for her and her friends. Beyond their talent, the whole team brought such a fun, calming energy. They were warm, professional, and made the getting-ready process feel relaxed and joyful. You could tell they truly cared about making us feel our best—and they absolutely did. Thank you, thank you, thank you for being such an unforgettable part of the day. We couldn’t have asked for a better team!!

The goal on your wedding day is to feel the prettiest you have ever felt in your life. Masara delivered that for me and I couldn’t be happier with how my makeup turned out. I have ...

gotten my makeup professionally done by various artists throughout the years and I have to say, no one has been able to apply concealer the way that she does. IT. DOES. NOT. MOVE. I felt airbrushed all day long. My makeup did not gather in my fine lines whatsoever and I feel like only a magician can achieve that. It was amazing. Additionally, she really listened to what I wanted. I felt like I didn’t want classic bridal makeup and she was able to pivot and deliver the look that I envisioned for myself. I could not recommend her enough.

sonality put me at ease. She took the time to listen to my preferences and tailored the look to suit my features perfectly. The attention to detail was impeccable—every stroke of the brush was done with precision and care. My makeup stayed flawless all day and night, and I received countless compliments! Whether it's for a special occasion, wedding, or just a glam day out, Masara is the only person I trust with my face. An absolute artist and a joy to work with!"

This review is loooooooong overdue. I was an October 2023 bride and I am still raving about Masara constantly. I am still so obsessed with how me and my bridesmaids make up turned ...

out for my wedding. Masara is so sweet and personable and I loved spending my wedding morning with her so much that when my friend asked me to be in her 2024 wedding I immediately referred her to Masara and again the makeup was everything and more! I am so happy I crossed paths with Masara I can’t recommend her enough!
