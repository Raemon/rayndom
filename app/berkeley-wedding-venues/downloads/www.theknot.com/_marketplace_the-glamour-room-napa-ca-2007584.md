Gabriela showed signs of needing help being organized since the beginning with typos in scheduling. She also has a very rude and harsh tone when trying to communicate what the diff...

erent styles of hair and make up are. As a designer I know there is a nice way to educate a client where you don’t try to make the client feel stupid. She does the opposite. She also completely changed the hair and makeup schedule two days before the wedding. After calling to revert back to the original, she still continued with her schedule and was very rude about it the morning of the wedding. She was very unkind to my non English speaking family and was visibly irritated and impatient. Overall she was rude, unorganized, unprofessional, and impatient. She says she’s been doing this for river 10 years but her unprofessionalism says otherwise. She also showed up 15 minutes late.

de’s worst nightmare but Gabriela saved the day! After she communicated with her next client l, she went straight to work doing my makeup. I was so grateful for her! She made sure she stayed true to who I was and made me feel beautiful on my special day. I would recommend her 100x over. She was so professional, a real talent and just overall made the experience great.
