g ceremony space, and a wonderfully indoor reception area. A very special shoutout goes to Hannah, our incredible wedding coordinator. From the start, she was attentive, organized, and genuinely invested in making sure our day was exactly how we envisioned it. What truly went above and beyond was her thoughtfulness in capturing photos of the decor as it was being set up. Also, helping us staying calm and always checking in on us throughout our wedding day. It's little things like that that show just how much she cares about her couples. Thank you to the entire team at Wedgewood for making our wedding unforgettable, and an extra big thank you to Hannah for being such a key part of making everything run so smoothly. Highly recommend this venue and team to any couple looking for a beautiful, well-run, and truly special wedding day!

agined. Throughout the whole process, Jackie, our coordinator, was by our side, helping ensure every single element of our wedding was exactly what we wanted, going above and beyond. She was always understanding, accommodating, responsive, bubbly and smiling, making me feel reassured. Jackie and the Chef were very accomodating of food allergies and preferences among our guests. And Jackie helped at every corner during the wedding, helping me prep to walk down the aisle, ensuring we were fed and hydrated, helping the photographer get the best pictures, and bustling me before our first dance. We were not expecting such an amazing, high level of service from the team! The venue turned out even more beautifully than expected and our day was amazing. We enjoyed working with the various vendors that partner with the venue, including the florist, DJ, and lighting. We did not have a good experience with the officiant, but our Wedgewood team was able to step in and help course correct.

Hannah and Tiana were great to work with throughout our entire planning process. Many friends asked why we were so relaxed throughout the year leading up to our wedding, especially...

the week and day of. The Stonetree Estate team made it simple: laying out plans, guiding us, and providing clear step-by-step instructions on how to get the most out of our wedding day and how to minimize stress or unexpected moments. The team knocked it out of the park on getting things done, and Hannah especially shined during the wedding day. She kept us on track, on time, and in the right place without feeling pushy, condescending, or rude. She knew when we were having a moment and didn't interrupt, and she was invaluable to both of us, not overly focused on the bride or the groom at any point. All staff/in-house vendors worked well with our outside vendors (photographers, videographers, and florist) and helped them get the most out of the venue. The only downside was we felt the open bar was pouring lightly (I had 5 or 6 Long Island ice teas and only felt a slight buzz). This was commented on by several of our guests, but as far as bad things that could happen on a wedding day, we felt that this didn’t do anything to ruin the mood at the reception, and we’d recommend Stonetree Estate to all of our friends and family. So many friends, families, and even a few of our vendors commented on how happy the entire wedding felt. One of our friends who is getting married in September commented, “This was the perfect wedding. Can we steal your whole idea board?”. So, thanks, Stonetree for making us the cool couple amongst our newly wedded friends!

I honestly can’t begin to describe how wonderful of an experience I had getting married at Stonetree Estate by Wedgewood weddings. It was truly a wonderful experience from start to...

finish. From the planning binder you receive upon booking with them, to each meeting with the planning team and the extravaganza, every stone is overturned. My wife and I had the absolute honor to work together with Jackie, who is a member of the planning team. She immediately made us feel comfortable from the moment we met her and I knew that we chose the perfect venue. She laughed and cried with us as we went through the planning process and then on wedding day as we committed to one another. She not only decorated beautifully and brought every detail of my wedding vision to life, no matter how silly my requests were, but she was also a friend, a confidant, a shoulder to cry on and a listening ear whenever it was needed. The venue itself is gorgeous. The golf course grounds are pristine and the sweeping trees and water features make for incredible photo backdrops. There is parking for guests and small shuttles can fit fine for hotel to venue drop off services with their recommended vender. Inside the ballroom is gorgeous with the wooden beams on the ceiling. The buffet was plenty of food for our guests to go back for seconds, and the bartenders were very professional and quick. I had so many guests approach me on my wedding day to tell me that it was the best wedding they had ever been to. I wish I could do it over again every weekend!

enjoyable. Jackie was our main coordinator and was exceptional. She was so organized, friendly and attentive to every detail. From the moment we met Jackie and went on a tour of the venue we knew this was the place for us. We were operating on a tight timeframe (2 months) so it was truly a team effort from Wedgewood to pull of the wedding of our dreams. We wanted to shout out both Tianna and Hannah who also helped along the way. The meetings we had with all the coordinators made wedding planning fun and not as stressful when you think of pulling off a 2 month wedding! They were super responsive and always available to jump on a call to talk through all the minute details we had along the way. You could tell they all genuinely cared about making our day perfect and went above and beyond to accommodate our requests. One of the best parts of working with the team at Wedgewood is their all-inclusive package. They made it so easy to customize our day and stay within our budget. The decor of the ceremony area, hallways and reception area was flawless. If something wasn't included in the package, they had vendors that were top-notch. Our guests couldn't stop raving about the setting, the food, and how smoothly everything ran. Our wedding day was everything we dreamed of and more, thanks to the amazing team at Wedgewood Weddings. If you're looking for a venue with impeccable service, beautiful spaces, and a team that genuinely cares, look no further!

My husband and I toured multiple Wedgewood Venues, but Stonetree was by far our favorite. The beautiful driveway caught our attention right away, it was straight out of a movie. Ou...

r initial tour went great, we even spotted an otter in the near by pond which we took as a sign since I work with animals. Planning went smoothly, each email and question was promptly answered in a timely manner. We were given a planning binder as soon as we booked our date, and each detail that the venue needed was specifically asked in the planner. They made it so easy from the very start. When I had a communication issue with another vendor they were there to iron out the wrinkles. At our final meeting we met with Tianna (who was filling in for our day of venue coordinator), and instantly we clicked. So much so that she requested to switch to be our day of! She brought each vision to life, including when I requested to enter from a different door at the reception, or when I specifically asked if I can have my vendors eat with the rest of the guest so that they were in arms reach. Tianna also helped run our practice rehearsal and made everybody feel confident about each part of the ceremony and their part. I applaud her for being able to wrangle my crazy family. The day of the wedding I was introduced to Taylor (our banquet captain), and honestly we were so blessed with a dream team. Taylor was so kind and always made sure we had a drink in our hand. We didn't know about all the small fires they both were able to put out until AFTER our big day, including improvising on seating arrangements, or moving our dessert table from the patio to inside the reception because the wind started to pick up. I was even told by a bridesmaid that Tianna stopped to ask if she was OK since she seemed a bit overwhelmed, and Tianna also created a codeword for another bridesmaid and the bartender who was requesting no alcohol in her drinks. Tianna also took the time to bustle my dress and get me into my party shoes when were running behind during our photoshoot/cocktail hour. Clean up was also a breeze, Taylor and the rest of the banquet team were able clear up the whole reception so quickly. Taylor was so sweet and personally helped us packed all of our decor items and even packed my husband and I some of the extra food and desserts. She even stayed a bit to chat while we packed up the car. She literally was icing on the cake. We were beyond impressed by this venue and their team, and received nothing but good reviews by our guest. We cannot recommend them enough!

From the beginning to the end Wedgewood at Stonetree was the perfect venue for us. When we first toured the venue we were debating between Wedgewood Stonetree and San Jose. We ulti...

mately chose Stonetree because of the huge bridal suite and upstairs pool table area for the groomsmen to hang out. Novato was also very close to where my husband and I met, so it was also sentimental to go back to the same area to get married. When we made the decision and booked with them, they were soooo organized. We live in Hawaii and chose a Wedgewood venue because it was all inclusive and would be the easiest to plan from another state. They shipped the wedding binder over to us that contained all the details we needed to know. The coordinators then set up a handful of appointments to make important wedding decisions. The coordinators were very attentive, answering all of my many questions leading up to the wedding. We were able to meet virtually for some appointments if we could not make it back to the Bay. In October, we were invited to an extravaganza with all the other wedding couples that booked. We were given a chance to see all the different types of decor, upgrade options, and try out the food. There were also many vendors that we met and a raffle for a chance to win upgrades. We loved this since we were able to preview all our options in person and had a great time. With only a little over a week leading up to the wedding, we had our final meeting with Jackie. Jackie was our assigned day of coordinator and she was thoughtful, attentive, organized, and super caring. Jackie made sure everything was in shape for the day of and lead our rehearsal. She instructed our wedding party how, when, and where to stand during the ceremony. Jackie also decorated and laid out the wedding day decorations just how I envisioned it and made everything look so beautiful. On the day of, Jackie was also SO wonderful. She checked on Max and I many times throughout the day and made sure we were well fed and hydrated. Jackie’s organization and reliability also gave me the chance to relax and just focus on us the day of. I did not need to worry about any logistics because she had everything covered. The food at the banquet was also FANTASTIC. The salmon, prime rib, and panko crusted chicken were all so delicious. Appetizers during cocktail hour was also very yummy. After the dinner service, it was Jackie’s time to go and she was swapped with the banquet captain. Since there wasn’t much time left, I didn’t get to interact with her much but she ensured that all our client provided items were packed and ready to be loaded in our car. Overall, I would highly recommend Wedgewood at Stonetree. They have a beautiful venue, wonderful staff, and exceptional food. Everything was so organized and executed very well. Thank you so much for making this day unforgettable.

team made sure that did not ruin our day! I will say that I didn’t use all their preferred vendors but all the ones we did use were wonderful! I just can’t say enough about how amazing this team was and they will make your day the absolute best day! I would recommend choosing the good weather months if you have a large guest count. We had a large guest count and luckily the team made it work flawlessly but of course we would’ve loved to have our ceremony outside. All in all it was a great experience, and we were very appreciative for all of the help we received along the way. Highly recommend working with this team!

This review is long overdue! We had our wedding back in December 2023 and I can say that we truly loved working with the Stonetree Estates Wedgewood Weddings team! I had a lot of...

anxiety trying to figure out where to even start when planning a wedding, but the team handled all of our concerns with the best quality and professionalism my entourage and I could have asked for. Also, they genuinely care about making your day special and will be sure keep you on track with the next initiatives so you never feel like you are planning this huge event alone! Kimber, Jackie, and the rest of team were such a pleasure to work with! From start to finish, the process was broken down and explained so seamlessly! Once the actual rehearsal and wedding days arrived, I was a bucket of nerves. But the team made sure to give me so much reassurance and are constantly on standby for me if I had any questions! They made everything so convenient! The Stonetree team really gave me and my entourage lots of confidence, love, and dedication! We had such an amazing wedding! Of course this is our happily ever after, but if I EVER for some reason had to help with someone else’s wedding, I will be sure to let them know of Stonetree Estates By Wedgewoods Weddings because then they’d be in amazing hands!

people are still talking about my wedding and how beautiful it was. Wedding stress? With stonetree, it never existed. The only stress I had was who was showing up and who wasn't, but stonetree made sure everything was handled. It may be a little pricey, but omg it is worth it. The food was amazing as well and your wedding coordinator made sure the bride a groom were able to eat. They also made sure my hand always had a drink. 😆 I guarantee you. You will have the dream wedding you wanted since you were a child with StoneTree.

we were prioritizing with our venue: wheelchair accessibility, ceremony, cocktail hour and reception in one general area, an indoor reception space and just good photo spots all over. This venue was all of that and more. The wedgewood team made the planning process so easy and we felt like we only really needed to book a few outside vendors like our photographer, boba bar etc. They did all the heavy lifting and all we really needed to do was pick our food, napkin colors, florals, cake etc. The one piece of feedback we had was for the photobooth that they own. The photos weren't the best quality and the printer ended up running out of paper. We shared this with the team afterwards and they immediatly responded to resolve the issue. Overall Stonetree ended up being our dream venue. Tianna who was our day of coordinator also deserves all the praise! She was so kind and helpful through the whole day and really kept us on track. Outside of the photobooth mishap, Stonetree and the wedgewood team really were incredible and we think any future brides/grooms would love the venue just as much as we did!

Seriously, the lovely wedding experts gave us a binder with everything we need to do and know, and periodically checked in with us. By the end of the first meeting, Wedgewood's planning team walked us through every little detail, and we felt that the planning was 80% done. Using their preferred vendor list made things streamlined and pain free as well. All we had to do was little decorations and guest gifts that made our wedding unique. My husband and I were cruising through the whole planning process with no stress. The day of the wedding was so much fun and our guests were having a great time. Im glad we picked Stonetree and had a great team that supported us. I would 100% do it all over again.

ollowed by an overview of the details. Shortly after we signed our contract and it began. A few weeks later we were invited to the venue to a dinner where we could try appetizers, drinks, meals and see table/decoration options. We then had a few other meetings throughout the next few months to ensure everything was running smoothly. The day of the wedding Kimber and Mae made everything look great and ensured we had a great time. 125 total guests and i've received nothing but compliments about the ceremony, venue, food etc. Can't recommend the location enough.

The whole team there was super sweet and really helped us have an amazing day. The fact that the venue is all-inclusive cut down so significantly on the stress of planning and honestly the time that we needed to plan a wedding (which is a lot). We were able to work with Stonetree and get exactly the day we wanted, they were super accommodating with any specific/unique things we wanted to do. Honestly the team there was so much fun to work with as well and made the process and the day feel like fun! Oh, plus the venue is beautiful and the food is delicious. I'm still dreaming about the apple phyllo kisses. Seriously, you should get them as one of your appetizers.

Our venue turned out beautiful and our guests could not stop telling us how much they loved the location, THE FOOD and the amazing drinks made by the bartender. Our DJ recommended by Wedgewood, DJ Steve, was also the most amazing person! He made sure all my song choices throughout the day were covered and was so personable on the mic. I did not have to think about a single thing the day-of because they made sure I was where I needed to be and just let me enjoy the experience. They even made sure I was all packed up before it was time to leave so I didn't even have to worry about it!!! Danielle, Mel and Angie were the greatest and I cannot recommend this location, the team and the Wedgewood package enough!!!

was professional, nice, patient, and attentive to every detail. They helped with adjusting our reception schedule (speeches, dancing, cake cutting, etc.) at very short notice and smiled the whole time. I never heard them say "no" or that nothing was possible. The team found a way to make everything work which made my bride and me very happy. Quick story. I waited too long to put on my boutonniere. Just before i walked down the aisle, the wedding coordinator retrieved the boutonniere from my relative, put it on very quickly, and it looked great. It all happened so fast and i appreciate her taking the initiative to help. This is just one of many examples of the staff's incredible efforts. StoneTree made our wedding very special and we wouldn't change a thing. I highly recommend working with them because they'll do everything to enhance your experience, just like they did for my wife and me.

After a long awaited wedding, my husband and I wanted this to be a PARTY and the DJ, Steve from Wedding Belle Music, did not disappoint! The flowers by Angella Garrett were absolute gorgeous and exactly what we had discussed. The StoneTree staff throughout the night were so thoughtful and enhanced the experience. I had guests the next day asking about the Photo Booth and commenting on how fun it was! I was grateful for our photographer, Thomas from A Perfect Impression, who had an eye for detail and made taking pictures a breeze. I cannot eat gluten and not only was StoneTree extremely accommodating, they also had tons of gluten free options. Christian from Krumb Cakes made the most delicious 4-tier gluten free cake (tier flavors: chocolate cake with salted caramel filling and vanilla cake with lingonberry jam and bavarian cream filling). The entire experience with StoneTree was wonderful and I am so grateful for all they did to make our special day so great! Thank you! Jennifer & Mike

Our initial wedding was on Sept of 2020 and we had to reschedule our date to May of 2021. At first, Stonetree was hesitant on changing because everything at the time was up in the ...

air, but as the date got closer and it was evident that weddings had to postponed, they helped us set a new date. Since our initial deposit could not be refunded due to corporate policies, they gave us free upgrades and discounts on our new dates which we really appreciated. They were very understanding of our situation and did not enforce a hard payment minimum because most of our guests could not come so we can't thank them enough for that. Stonetree's package definitely made planning and working with vendors very easy. The lighting, florist, cake, and DJ all work directly with Stonetree so they knew exactly what needed to be done and there were no real headaches to make sure everything gets delivered. Stonetree also provided a day of coordinator which was really helpful to make sure the wedding went smoothly. Unfortunately, our coordinator had to leave in the middle of the event so we didn't know we were behind schedule after dinner time. But the DJ was on top of it since he worked the event so many times and helped us get back on track! Overall, Stonetree was great and we heard great things from our guests that attended our wedding. We recommend them to others!

to change our date to a year later (we just got married April 25th, 2021) with a discount and the flexibility we needed for our family/friends. Wow - our loved ones cannot stop talking about how incredible the day was. It was truly a dream and we cannot thank Lili and the entire Wedgewood team including DJ Steve, our photographer Andy, Angela for the flower arrangements enough for making it better than we could have ever imagined. The outdoor ceremony is just incredible with the beautiful scenery, which makes for perfect photos! My wife and I are busy surgical resident physicians in Sacramento, which made choosing Wedgewood a no brainer for us based on previous reviews. And they lived up to it! It was so easy to work with everyone and to pick things we wanted and didn't want based on the very flexible and interchangeable packages they have. Also being on a budget, we never felt that we were being pushed to add things we thought were unneeded. We compliment the entire team for helping us schedule things around our schedule! We truly cannot recommend Wedgewood enough. We would choose this company and venue many times over.

In January 2020, we signed the contract with Wedgewood and were to be married in January 2021. We had paid the initial deposit in January 2020 and the second installment was due in...

June 2020. Due to the pandemic, we asked before the second installment was due if we could reschedule or postpone our wedding, due to concerns for family members who are at-risk. They said they felt that our "event date was viable and that changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic will be minimal if not dissipated by that time." They said they were going forward with all events from August 2020 on. Even now in December 2020, the Bay Area is under a Stay at Home Order. They weren't willing to reschedule or offer any type of reimbursement. I understand that it has been difficult for businesses during this time, but their inflexibility to reschedule or even offer a refund when barely any work was done is disappointing and frustrating.

r person, venue etc. was very stressful and overwhelming for us until we discovered Wedgewood's All-Inclusive event. We were able to schedule an appointment with one of their wedding experts, who made our dream wedding become a reality. We booked our wedding date with her after receiving a phenomenal tour of their property. I cannot explain the joy and excitement my wife and I experienced after signing our contract. Then, less than a month before our wedding we received a phone call stating that Wedgewood could hold our wedding at our scheduled date due to the COVID-19 pandemic that was taking place throughout the Bay Area. We were devastated and at a lost of words because we have been planning for our special day for nearly two years so that we could become Husband and Wife. After the call, we were able to reschedule our wedding a few months later, but then with there was a surge in corona virus cases after restrictions were beginning to lift throughout the Bay Area. Ultimately, Wedgewood proposed for us to have a ceremony at our new scheduled date and gave us the option of having a reception for a celebration at a later date. I must say that COVID-19 was an unprecedented time for everyone and I read many articles about lack of professionalism, empathy, drama, disappointment etc. that other couples received from their wedding venues. BUT!!! I must say that Wedgewood maintained their professionalism throughout their entire process and money was not their concern. Their priority was to fulfill my Wife and I's dream wedding and our event was nothing short of AMAZING!!! I am so happy that Wedgewood made our dreams come true and I highly recommend this company for any and everyone who is prepared to tie the knot with life partner.

ng more money down on a non-refundable establishment. Luckily we only put down the initial deposit that we will be losing on. But they insisted even in this uncertainty... that we must make the 2nd installment payment and would not offer any type of reimbursement if the wedding had to get cancelled. Can you believe that???? Put more money down. Because of them demanding the additional payment with no reassurance of a refund. I am no longer going to be having the wedding that I imagined. I understand that they have a business to run, and that this pandemic has impacted them. But the manager Rachel promised, "we are a family company. We will do what's right!". In my opinion, and in a state of emergency... if someone doesn't want to postpone, getting a partial refund is right. Not everyone wants to be in wedding limbo for the unseen future. Because the truth is... this COVID-19 issue could go on for years.

To put all our beyond satisfied feelings we have for the Wedgewood team at StoneTree is going to be a challenge, but here we go. First of all, we got engaged in January 2018, visit...

ed our wedding fair the next month in February where we ran into the Wedgewood booth who mentioned "all-inclusive" which intrigued the both of us, visited the Novato location in March where we fell in love with the location and met the best team, and then booked our date in April! We booked November 2019, so we had a little over a year and a half to plan everything. Throughout this time, I emailed over 100 emails back and forth with the team. They are so fast to respond, and always have an answer for everything. As the day got closer (and oh, did time fly!), we met our two event captains Lili and Alma. These two ladies did SUCH an amazing, flawless job at organizing, facilitating the chain of events, communicating to the bridal party and the guests, and overall throwing together the best day of me and my husband's life. To this day, the both of us say we literally did not have to lift one finger that day; we felt like a King and Queen. I truly feel every bridal couple should feel this way. There should not be any stress the day of your wedding because it is your day to enjoy every single second because it goes by right before your eyes. This venue is beautiful. The courtyard had romantic string lights, the archway was decorated by the talented florist Angella, DJ Steve was a great host and DJ who really got the crowd settled at the ceremony and then lively with good vibes at the reception, the food was delicious, including the sweet cake by Krumbs, and the awesome Wedgewood staff did such a great job at making sure the guests were all taken care of. Can't forget the great open bar the whole night and also the add-on of sliders and fries at the end of the night. All our guests keep saying how great the wedding was, and 100% agree. Everything was more than we could ever ask for. Thank you a million times, Wedgewood StoneTree!

Everything was so fluid . My favorite thing is all through Wedgewood we received: a DJ (Steve was the best). Florist (Angella is amazing) and our cake (crumb cake was delicious). We used an outside photobooth but i would guarantee there’s is amazing we just decided last minute to do one :) I never wanted my night to end. I wanted to relive the moment over and over again.

out how beautiful the space was. Danielle was our coordinator and she was so helpful in setting up all of our decorations and made it look amazing. The food was AMAZING - our guests seriously could not stop talking about the Panko Parmesan Chicken! We also used their DJ and he was great at keeping people on the dancefloor. Danielle was so great during the wedding, making sure we were taken care of. She also helped direct our rehearsal the day before and made sure everyone knew where to be and when. My husband and I live out of state, but Wedgewood was great at being flexible in terms of meeting with us and even FaceTiming us a few times to help us visualize the space and answer any questions we had. Overall, we had a magical wedding and are so glad we went with StoneTree. Thank you, Danielle and the Wedgewood staff!

My husband and I got married in September of 2018. Both Rachel and Katy did a phenomenal job making my wedding dreams come to life! They were so accommodating and understanding wit...

h our demands regarding my husband's military schedule. We needed to change the date twice due to work conflicts on his end, we couldn't make all the in person appointments, etc. This was no issue for the Wedgewood team! They did everything they could to make sure each phone appointment was as detailed and enjoyable as an in person appointment. I really appreciated all the hard work the team put in to make this day absolutely perfect. Right after my husband and I finished walking down the isle they snapped a photo of us and had it printed out and framed within minutes sitting at our head table when we walked in for our reception! It's the little details that made this day so special!! I highly recommend anyone searching for a wedding venue or company to go through Wedgewood! They really take care of everything for you and make wedding planning completely enjoyable!!
