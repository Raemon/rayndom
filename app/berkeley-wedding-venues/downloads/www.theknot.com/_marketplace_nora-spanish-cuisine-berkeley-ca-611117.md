We hired Nora Spanish Cuisine to cater the welcome dinner for our wedding and got *so* many glowing reviews from our guests. We ordered the Paella de Pollo, Paella de Carne, Paella...

Huertana, Ensalada Verde, Montadito de Piquillo, Tortilla, Ceviche, and Champignones Rellenos con Chorizo, and it was all absolutely delicious. A few highlights for me were the Paella de Carne and the Ceviche! Highly recommend their food and service!

We have always loved dining at La Marcha, so when we learned that they also did catering, we knew we had to have them at our wedding. Throughout planning, Emily and her team were s...

uper responsive to all of our questions and helped us plan the best menu given our guest count and budget. They worked seamlessly with our coordinator to ensure that everything would run smoothly on the day of, from cocktail hour to dinner service to dessert. They also took care of all of our rentals and answered probably 87 questions about napkins and forks from us. We had many guests with dietary restrictions, and Nora was so accommodating and made sure all our guests were well fed and taken care of. On the day of, the staff who worked the event were so kind and attentive to our guests! Dinner service ran smoothly, and cocktail hour went great with the Nora bartenders mixing our signature cocktails. Having the paella cooking in the background of cocktail hour was great, and it made guests especially excited for dinner. And last but not least, the food was incredible. So many of our friends and family told us that this was the best wedding food they had ever had, and many are planning on visiting La Marcha in the future as a result! Having Nora cater our wedding was such a special part of the day, and we’d highly recommend working with Emily and her team!

lt forgotten about. Lynn was our catering team lead the day of and she was OUTSTANDING!! She went above and beyond. The food was absolutely incredible. Everyone was raving about it. And everyone loved how they cooked it in front of the guests. This was the best vendor decisions we made for our wedding.

ys so positive, flexible and supportive as we navigated the craziness. When it finally came time to celebrate this May (2021), everyone was completely FLOORED by the quality of food provided. The appetizers were incredible (they even made a gorgeous plate for us post nuptials to enjoy during photos!), fresh/hot/tasty. And of course, the paella was a huge hit. It was a beautiful, interactive experience for guests to watch the paella come to life during cocktail hour, and was SOOOOOO TASTY! We had three types of paella available, and the servers were very generous with portions, while making sure everyone was able to try all three if they wanted. There was plenty of food to go around, and offer seconds to those interested. The team was great to work with and our venue had nothing but wonderful things to say about them. They also helped coordinate all rentals needed for the evening which was such a nice perk (and we got a 10% discount!). We can't wait to enjoy their paella at their restaurant and re-live our wedding dinner! Venue: Taber Ranch (https://taberranch.com) Photographer: Liz Erban (https://lizerban.com)

We hired Nora's Spanish Catering for our wedding in July 2019 which was down in Carmel Valley. They were absolutely amazing!!! I highly recommend! We originally met with Adrian fo...

r our first meeting and tasting. The food was to die for and the prices were pretty decent. Adrian left Nora Catering and handed us over to Ama. You would think that was a little stressful in the midst of wedding planning being passed around lol.. but when we met Ama, she was truly wonderful, sweet, accommodating, funny, and sooo much better to work with! There aren't even enough words to describe how great she was. We went back for a second and third meeting with Ama and I really felt like we became friends lol. She also acted as part of our coordinator, coming up with a timeline to follow, giving us numbers on how much alcohol we need to buy for our wedding (bc we hired Nora to be our bartenders as well), etc. Communication was great whether it was via text or email. On the day of, I just trusted that things will come together on it's own.. and it did! They were on time and helped us set up everything from tables, linens, glassware, china, desserts, etccc! Catering is one of the biggest vendors and we are so pleased with the turn out! Everyone is still raving about the food. It was different and unique than your typical American style wedding courses and more affordable! Ama went out of her way to give us an entire plate of tapas to make sure we ate. The staff were all so friendly and professional! We apparently had really heavy drinkers too (Vietnamese and Irish)... and later found out that the staff went to purchase more alcohol for us during our wedding because we were running low. That is going the extra mile and we appreciate it so much! I highly recommend Nora Spanish Catering for your wedding or any event!

We were so excited at first for this caterer because all the tastings were delicious. But, we just had a really poor experience with one of the event coordinators and it really tur...

ned us off. She just up and disappeared for a few weeks right before the event and then when I was freaking out, she didn’t see the importance in returning emails for three weeks and taking over a month to get rental quotes to me. So rude to me once we got in contact. It wouldn’t have been a big deal if we were months out, but we were less than two weeks out and at that point I didn’t know if we still had a caterer. Unprofessional and stressful. Plus, a lot of the communication we did have before the disappearance was so quick and brief in the reply that the emails led to more questions to clear up confusions or rephrasing the questions because they were not answered. After complaining to management about my experience, Nora came through though and switch event coordinators and the event ended up being a success. If this wasn’t the case, I would have only left 1 star. I would have left 5 if we had the service we had in the end all the way through. I would use them again if I could control who helped us.

Wow I cannot say better things about Ñora Catering. Ama is their coordinator and she absolutely rocks. I cannot stress enough that working with Ama is what made Ñora amazing. She...

was so thorough and organized and my day of coordinator couldn't stop singing her praises as a vendor who was really on top of it and handled everything. I don't know how much she makes, but she definitely deserves a raise! We had a backyard wedding at my parents home. Ama came out to our house a few months before the wedding and walked through the property, she dealt with the rental company for us and had an amazing staff who came and set it all up. Now the food. The tapas were impecable, and cooked to perfection. The paella we had was beautiful and was definitely a spectacle for our guests to watch being cooked, plus it was delicious. Since we missed cocktail hour, Ama made sure a plate of all the tapas was on our sweetheart table so we could taste them which was so thoughtful. The staff boxed up all the leftovers for us and left them in our fridge which made for amazing brunch food the next day. If you're considering working with Ñora, I can't recommend them enough.

ediately got super excited about working with her and her staff. Ama made everything seamless and so simple - we had such a stress free wedding day, a lot of which has to be credited to Ama and her excellent staff! She literally thought of everything before I/anyone had to say anything - THANK YOU, AMA! The food is beyond delicious - both in the restaurant, at the tasting AND at the wedding (which is a huge feat when cooking for a large crowd). The majority of our guests commented on the amazing food (veggie and mixed paella, brussel sprouts, naranja salad and mixed tapas) and mentioned it was by far the best wedding food they had tasted. We also had many comments on how excellent Ama and her staff were. I would highly, highly recommend Ama, her staff, and Nora catering without any hesitation!

the food within our budget. We visited their restaurant for our tasting and now its one of our favorite places to go! The day of, the team showed up on time, cooked delicious food and even helped to turn on our candles and make sure the tables looked perfect before the reception started. I would definitely book them again and already do recommend them!

We chose Nora to cater our 150 person rustic off-the-grid farm wedding in Petaluma in August 2017 and their food and service was amazing! We found them via Yelp, and also my mom ha...

d been to a party catered by them previously. We worked with Ama (as our day of catering coordinator) and Adrian as our contact throughout the planning process who were both very professional and accommodating, and their rates are very fair. Our wedding planner (Dandelion Events) also enjoyed working with them and expressed how nice and accommodating their service was (flexibility about having chefs and staff do certain kitchen tasks and making it work with our budget). The day-of staff and bartenders were so sweet to my groom and I -- finding us to ask if we needing anything, making sure we ate, and letting us know when our signature cocktail was running low and if we wanted a last one, etc. Fantastic service! The food was also amazing (food actually turned out better than we had during our 2 tastings at their restaurant) and many guests came up to say it was some of the best wedding food they'd had. We ordered the paella mixta, paella huertana, patatas bravas, Brussels sprouts (2 months later, several friends have brought up these Brussels sprouts in conversation!), and green salad. Their visual display and at the buffet was great too. My wedding dress was so form fitting that I couldn't have second helpings (lol), so we were so happy to discover the next day they had refrigerated 2 trays of leftovers for us! An amazing treat the day after your wedding when you're tired and still floating on a love cloud and get to enjoy your wedding meal again. Overall so pleased with the experience and would gladly recommend to anyone who wants to have amazing and unique wedding food!

The food and service from Nora’s Spanish Catering was amazing! All my guests raved about the food, and loved seeing it being prepared in the enormous paella pans. The presentatio...

n was beautiful, the food was delicious, and the staff was so helpful and accommodating. We had several gluten and/or dairy free guests (as well as a few vegetarians and vegans) – and this was the perfect way to accommodate these food restrictions without sacrificing flavor. I would happily rate them 5 stars for the event itself. However, a few weeks after the reception the coordinator called to ask about the envelopes containing the tips for the staff – one for her, and one for the rest of the staff. She acted confused by the amounts, and it felt a little bit like she was expecting more. Unfortunately, it was a tacky way to end an otherwise fantastic experience.
