Updated Jun 23, 2025

Bridal and wedding showers are among the most popular prewedding events, giving guests the opportunity to celebrate one or both of the soon-to-be-weds before the wedding. In fact, according to our [The Knot 2025 Real Weddings Study](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-data-insights/real-weddings-study), 64% of respondents celebrated with a shower before the big celebration. 

[READ MORE The Bridal Shower Checklist Every Host Needs ](https://www.theknot.com/content/a-bridal-shower-planning-checklist)

But now that you've heard the terms "wedding shower" and "bridal shower" used, you might be wondering if there's a difference between the two. Turns out, there is. "Essentially, a wedding shower is a modern twist on the traditional bridal shower," says Melissa Weiler, award-winning owner and principal designer of [Persnickety Invitation Studio](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/persnickety-invitation-studio-york-pa-250647). To get the inside scoop on these two affairs, whether you're planning a wedding shower or still deciding which type of party fits your needs, here's the full rundown of the differences between a bridal shower and a wedding shower.

**In this article:** What Is a Wedding Shower? | Wedding Shower Purpose | Wedding Shower Vs. Bridal Shower | Can You Have Two Showers?




## What Is a Wedding Shower?

The wedding shower is an opportunity for the couple's closest relatives and friends to meet and celebrate before the wedding. The party takes place a few weeks or months before the wedding and typically involves light hors d'oeuvres, games and watching the couple open their registry gifts.

FEATURED VIDEO FROM THE KNOT

A wedding shower's meaning and concept is pretty similar to a [bridal shower](https://www.theknot.com/content/what-is-a-bridal-shower), with the guest list being one of the main differences. "Historically, the bridal shower was an opportunity for guests—typically the female friends and family members of the bride—to help her assemble what she might need to set up her new home: kitchen items, linens and bedding, and china and flatware," says Weiler. "Since many couples already live together before the wedding, showers these days have evolved to become a celebration of the couple, shared by the friends and family of both," she continues.

## What Is the Purpose of a Wedding Shower?

The purpose of a wedding shower is to "shower" the couple with love, well-wishes and wedding gifts before their special day. Guests who are invited to the shower usually buy a gift from the [couple's wedding registry](https://www.theknot.com/content/rules-of-wedding-gift-giving) and bring it to the party for the to-be-weds to open. And while the bridal shower is traditionally only for female guests, a [couple's shower](https://www.theknot.com/content/couple-bridal-shower-basics) is a great chance for people from both sides to meet and mingle.

## Wedding Shower vs. Bridal Shower Key Differences

Even though a wedding shower sounds similar to a bridal shower, there are numerous reasons why they differ. Keep reading to learn what sets them apart from one another. 

![Differences between bridal shower and wedding shower](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/dea0096f-b153-4d31-b92b-e30cfd452051~rs_768.h)

**Key differences:** Host | Guests | Timing | Venue | Activities | Gifts




### Who Hosts and Pays

The first step of planning any shower is choosing the host or hosts. These loved ones will not only plan, but also pay for, the majority of the shower. Here's who typically hosts a wedding shower or bridal shower.

**Bridal Shower Host** : The bridal shower is traditionally planned and hosted by the bridal party, led by the [maid of honor](https://www.theknot.com/content/maid-of-honor-duties-in-detail). In the past, family members were discouraged from being the [bridal shower host](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-shower-host-etiquette), as it seemed like a direct plea for gifts. However, since MOH and bridesmaids are tasked with [planning the bachelorette party](https://www.theknot.com/content/bachelorette-parties-planning-checklist) as well, the bride's close family members are now being involved in the planning and also helping [pay for the bridal shower](https://www.theknot.com/content/who-pays-for-the-bridal-shower). "In the age of busy schedules and cross-country travel for weddings, some couples are reluctant to add shower planning to their wedding party's responsibilities, so we see the [mother of the bride](https://www.theknot.com/content/mother-of-the-bride-duties) taking the reins on the hosting the bridal shower at her home," says Weiler. "It's not uncommon for a few of the MOB's closest friends to assist with this—often this group has raised their children together and the bridal shower is an opportunity for them to share in this milestone with their friend and her daughter." The bride's future mother-in-law and/or her friends may also take the lead in planning a bridal shower.

### Find your kind of venue

From barns to ballrooms, discover reception venues that feel like you.

**Wedding Shower Host** : A wedding shower can be planned by any of the wedding party members, friends and/or family. The responsibility can also be shared among loved ones depending on who else is hosting other prewedding events, says Sumeta Satija, managing director of [One H'ART Events](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/one-hart-events-atlanta-ga-2044605). "I've seen a trend of an engagement party being hosted by one set of parents and a wedding shower being hosted by the other, especially if the families live in different states or countries," says Satija, who has over 10 years of event production experience.

_[Photo: Ruét Photo](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/ruet-photo-georgetown-tx-768995)_

### Who Is Invited

While the guest lists may differ somewhat between a wedding shower and a bridal shower, one shower etiquette rule remains: Those [invited to a shower](https://www.theknot.com/content/must-invite-bridal-shower-guests-to-the-wedding) must be invited to the wedding. However, not all wedding guests need to be invited to the shower.

**Bridal Shower Guests:** The [bridal shower guest list](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-shower-invite-etiquette) typically includes female members of the wedding party, as well as other close family members and friends. "Bridal shower guests usually—although not always—are the female friends and family of the bride," explains Weiler. It's also typical for the bride's parents to invite a few of their female friends to the event as well, especially if they were by their side as the daughter was growing up. Also, anywhere from 10 to 50 guests are usually invited to a bridal shower. Most importantly, does the bride's [partner go to the bridal shower](https://www.theknot.com/content/should-the-groom-attend-bridal-shower)? It's not traditional for the bride's partner to attend since it's a celebration specifically for the bride, but they can make a brief appearance towards the end of the event. If the bride's partner does come, it's common for the partner to bring flowers and stay for photos.

**Wedding Shower Guests:** A wedding shower's guest list is gender-inclusive and typically bigger than bridal showers, with the guest count ranging from 30–50 guests (or more). "The wedding shower will be a large group of close friends of the parents, close friends of the couple, and close relatives to the host family," says Satija. Also, the wedding shower party is an event that the couple attends together.

### When to Have

Wedding showers and bridal showers typically take place within the same timeframe—anywhere from two weeks to three months before the wedding day. The parties are often on a Saturday or Sunday and usually last between two and four hours. However, the time of day when these events take place tends to be the main difference between a bridal shower and wedding shower.

**Bridal Shower Timing:** A bridal shower is often a [brunch](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-shower-brunch), lunch or [afternoon tea](https://www.theknot.com/content/tea-party-bridal-shower-theme) event that usually starts between 10:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m. This [bridal shower timing](https://www.theknot.com/content/best-time-for-bridal-shower) leaves enough space for a variety of activities, gift giving and more, with everyone home before dinnertime.

**Wedding Shower Timing:** When do you have a wedding shower? Well, the timing of a wedding shower is a bit more flexible. While some wedding showers take place during the day, many are evening events centered around happy hour or dinner. This also encourages the events to be a little more lively, often with signature [shower cocktails](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-shower-drinks) or some type of entertainment.

### Venue

Once you have an idea of the guest count and a timeframe for when the shower will occur, it's time to choose a venue. Your location will depend on the type of event, but according to Weiler: "Both types of showers can easily take place at either a residence or a venue, but most often, bridal showers are held at the host's home and wedding showers are held at a venue."

**Bridal Shower Venues:** "The host's home, a local cafe or a tea room are the most popular [venues for bridal showers](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-shower-venues)," says Tonya Hoopes, founder and wedding planner at [Hoopes Events](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/hoopes-events-park-city-ut-769452). "If you're doing an activity-centered shower, it might be held at a nail salon, painting studio or location that works with the activity," she says with experience planning over 600 events.

**Wedding Shower Venues:** While a loved one's home is certainly an appropriate wedding shower location, these events are more often held elsewhere, like a private event space at the couple's favorite restaurant or bar. "Since many wedding showers are planned by the couple's friends and duties are being shared, it makes more sense to some to host it at a venue where the hosts can split the costs and cleanup duty doesn't fall to any one person or group," says Weiler.

### Activities

Mingling, eating [bridal shower food](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-shower-food-ideas) and drinking are mainstays of most showers, but there are other activities that usually take place. From games to gift opening, here's what activities might occur at each event. 

**Bridal Shower Activities:** According to Weiler, hosts tend to follow a pretty structured [bridal shower timeline](https://www.theknot.com/content/a-bridal-shower-planning-checklist)—for example, greeting, food, gifts, cake and games. While the bride opening gifts in front of the assembled guests is a traditional bridal shower activity, it's not mandatory. "Some brides resist being the center of attention and opt for a '[display shower](https://www.theknot.com/content/display-shower),' which is when gifts are brought unwrapped and displayed on a table, giving the bride more time to socialize with her guests," Weiler says. [Bridal shower games](https://www.theknot.com/content/a-complete-guide-to-bridal-shower-games) and icebreakers (such as [bridal jeopardy](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-jeopardy-questions) and [wedding Mad Libs](https://www.theknot.com/content/mad-libs-wedding-ideas)) are popular, as are activities like guests sharing marriage advice or toasting the couple. The bride's partner may make an appearance toward the end of the event and partake in an activity, like the ever-popular [wedding shoe game](https://www.theknot.com/content/shoe-game-wedding-reception-game-questions). Some bridal showers are centered around an activity, such as a cooking demonstration, painting class or spa services, which can help keep guests busy and entertained.

**Wedding Shower Activities:** "Wedding showers are by nature more organic and most often take the shape of a relaxed social gathering, with fluid seating, dinner stations and passed appetizers," Weiler says. Guests occasionally even step up to toast the couple. "While most attendees still bring a gift, many couples opt to either open gifts as they receive them, or to collect and open them later," Weiler adds. Consider doing the [Newlywed Game](https://www.theknot.com/content/newlywed-game-questions) or bingo for your wedding shower.

### Gifts

Gift giving is one of the most important activities that takes place during a shower. The gifts for both showers can come from the couple's [wedding registry](https://www.theknot.com/registry), however, the type of gift tends to differ between the two prewedding parties. (**Psst:** Check out all the [shower gift etiquette](https://www.theknot.com/content/is-wedding-gift-necessary) you need to know.)

**Bridal Shower Gifts:** Some [bridal shower gift ideas](https://www.theknot.com/content/classic-andcontemporary-bridal-shower-gift-ideas) include jewelry, lingerie, pampering and self-care products, or something to set up her home after marriage, says Marci Guttenberg, founder of [An Affair to Remember by Marci](https://www.rsvps4u.com/) with 30 years of event planning expertise. "Close relatives may also opt to provide family heirlooms passed down from generation to generation," she adds. There may also be a theme where guests are asked to bring certain types of gifts, like gifts for the kitchen for a kitchen shower or lingerie for a [lingerie bridal shower](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-to-throw-lingerie-shower).

**Wedding Shower Gifts:** In contrast to the bridal shower, wedding shower gifts should be items that the couple can use and enjoy together. These are typically taken from the wedding registry, but guests can also choose gifts that speak to the couple's relationship. "At a wedding shower, the couple receives gifts that can be shared as a couple, such as household items and linens. Nowadays, monetary gifts like [gift cards](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-shower-gift-cards) are also common," says Sheavonne Harris, founder of [Events by Sheavonne](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/events-by-sheavonne-new-york-ny-964818) who's been in the event planning business since 2004. Weiler adds, "Gifts for the wedding shower can also reflect the personality and shared interests of the couple. For example, barware for a couple who enjoys entertaining or a gift certificate for zip lining for a couple who loves adventure."




## Can You Have Both a Wedding Shower and a Bridal Shower?

If you don't know which type of event you want, you can always plan to have both a bridal and wedding shower, but there are a few caveats. The events should have different hosts, different guest lists, and be held in different locations. For example, a bridal shower can be thrown by the maid of honor in the city where the bride grew up, and a wedding shower can be thrown by the couple's friends in the city they currently reside in. "While it is okay to have multiple showers, ensure you're not inviting the same guests to both showers as this is seen more as a gift grab than a celebration of the couple," says Hoopes. (Don't know if either event is something you want? See what experts have to say about not [having a bridal shower](https://www.theknot.com/content/not-having-a-bridal-shower-etiquette) or a wedding shower.)
