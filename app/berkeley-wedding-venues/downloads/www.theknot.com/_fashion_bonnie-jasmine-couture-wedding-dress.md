Description

Bonnie is an elegant and romantic gown crafted from Eileen organza. The strapless corset top with satin trim creates a structured silhouette, while the satin waistband defines the waist. The voluminous A-line skirt flows gracefully, finished with a semi-cathedral train that adds drama and sophistication. Covered buttons trail down the back to the edge of the train. Perfect for brides who want classic beauty with a modern twist.
