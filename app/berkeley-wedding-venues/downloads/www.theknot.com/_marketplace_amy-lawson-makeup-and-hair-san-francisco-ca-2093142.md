Amy gave me a sense of calm and confidence on my wedding day, and I can't thank her enough for her time and effort! I needed a look that would wear comfortably all day, through two...

different ceremonies and an evening reception. On top of that, I also needed assistance for 6 other bridesmaids with hectic schedules. She patiently worked with me via email to arrange all of the details, even with some of my last minute changes to styling. During our trial we scanned through some photo-inspo, and landed on a look that I absolutely loved. On my wedding day, she and her team arrived promptly and set me and my bridesmaids up without issue. Between ceremonies she was there to help me fix my makeup, and before leaving, she provided me with a small touch up kit for my hair and lips. Working with Amy was also just good vibes! She's lovely to chat with, professional, and I'm grateful to have had her expertise on such a special day.
