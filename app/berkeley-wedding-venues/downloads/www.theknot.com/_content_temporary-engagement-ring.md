Take a moment to envision your [dream proposal](https://www.theknot.com/content/romantic-ways-to-propose). You probably imagine receiving your dream engagement ring (or presenting your partner with theirs). But have you ever considered getting engaged with a temporary engagement ring? Before you completely write off the idea, the concept might not be as far-fetched as you think. 

Buying the perfect proposal piece comes with a lot of pressure—not only because it's a significant financial investment, but also because you want to get it right the first time. Whether you're the proposer or the proposee, talking about the engagement ring beforehand—or even going shopping and [trying them on together](https://www.theknot.com/content/why-you-should-try-engagement-rings-on-before-you-buy)—is a great way to eliminate some of that added stress. But another option (and one you might not have even thought of) is starting with a placeholder engagement ring. 

FEATURED VIDEO FROM THE KNOT

The "right" decision will be different for every couple, and what makes sense for you and your S.O. might not be what your sibling or your bestie did. But if you're curious to know more about getting engaged with a temporary engagement ring, we break down everything you need to know about this alternative option. 

**In this article:**

  * What is a Temporary Engagement Ring?
  * Why Propose With a Temporary Engagement Ring?
  * Is it OK to Propose With a Temporary Engagement Ring?
  * Where to Buy a Temporary Engagement Ring



## What is a Temporary Engagement Ring? 

A temporary engagement ring is a stand-in ring presented during a proposal, which will eventually be replaced by a permanent engagement ring. This isn't to be confused with a [promise ring](https://www.theknot.com/content/what-is-a-promise-ring), which is a piece of jewelry exchanged while dating that symbolizes your intention to get married in the future. Instead, a temporary engagement ring is not the "real" engagement ring, per se, but rather a stand-in design that your partner will wear until the official ring is purchased. A temporary engagement ring can also be kept and worn in a daily ring stack, or be used as a travel ring.

While it may sound unconventional, couples have been revamping traditional [proposal "rules"](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-proposals-how-to-propose) in recent years—and this is one modern take to consider if you want to be heavily involved in the selection of the engagement ring, but don't want to spoil the surprise of the proposal. "[Temporary engagement rings] are becoming more of a trend, especially for wearers who might want to give some input or be involved in the search for the 'real' thing," says jeweler [Michelle Oh](https://michelle-oh.com/). "It allows the proposer to still ask the question with something in hand." 

## Why Propose With a Temporary Engagement Ring?

While it's common to get engaged with a ring, there's no rule stating that you _must_ present a piece of jewelry when you pop the question. According to The Knot 2024 Jewelry & Engagement Study, 94% of couples said that a ring was exchanged during the proposal—that means 6% of people either didn't get engaged with a ring, or they exchanged something else. 

There are a few reasons to consider proposing with a placeholder engagement ring. In Oh's experience, the most common rationale among her clients is that they want to make sure they get their purchase right the first time. One way to do that, of course, is to go shopping together after getting engaged with a stand-in ring. "If someone isn't sure they will be able to choose an engagement ring themselves, or if they don't feel confident that their partner would want them to choose a ring without their input, being able to decide together later on is never a bad idea," she says. 

The financial aspect of buying an engagement ring is another reason to consider getting a placeholder first. According to our data, the [average cost of an engagement ring](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-much-to-spend-on-engagement-ring) right now is $5,200. While that number has been steadily declining over the years, it's still a hefty chunk of change. If you aren't able to invest in your partner's dream ring right away, you might consider getting a more affordable version to propose with. Then, after you're able to save up for the real deal, you can invest in a design you know they'll love forever. 

## Is it OK to Propose With a Temporary Engagement Ring? 

Here's the simple answer: Yes, it is okay to propose with a temporary engagement ring. When it comes to getting engaged and planning your future together, you and your S.O. might determine that getting a placeholder ring first is the right decision. That said, if you plan on proposing with a temporary engagement ring, we recommend talking to your partner about it ahead of time, that way they won't be confused or disappointed by the gesture. After all, it's less about what you do, and more about the meaning behind it. "Our ideas about what is 'romantic' have changed over time," Oh says. "[Getting engaged] is no longer about being surprised, but more about your intentions during a proposal." 

Alternatively, if you want to wait to discuss it until after the proposal, be sure to explain your plan to replace the temporary design with a real one. Once the actual engagement ring is on their hand, they can always keep the temporary accessory and use it as a travel ring to keep their precious gem safe.

## Where to Buy a Temporary Engagement Ring 

Ready to start your search for a temporary engagement ring? Here are some of our favorite places to buy placeholder engagement rings. When you're ready to invest in a permanent piece, follow our comprehensive[ engagement ring shopping guide](https://www.theknot.com/content/engagement-ring-buying-steps) for help every step of the way. 

### Etsy

While a temporary engagement ring is significantly less expensive than a traditional engagement ring, that doesn't mean it has to be cheap (or poorly made). Plenty of small businesses on Etsy offer stunning handmade jewelry designs that can serve as a placeholder ring. Start by searching terms like "temporary engagement ring," "placeholder engagement ring," or "travel engagement ring." As with all online orders, we recommend reading reviews for the seller and their individual products to ensure that your purchase is legitimate.

Yep, Amazon has everything—even temporary engagement rings.
