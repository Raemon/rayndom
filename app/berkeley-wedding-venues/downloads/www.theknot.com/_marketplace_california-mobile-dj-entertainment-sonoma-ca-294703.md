Overall my experience with Cal mobile entertainment was very good. They were very responsive to emails and professional. Mike was a great DJ who was able to read the guests very we...

ll and keep the dance floor filled, also a nice guy! We also got a photobooth from Cal Mobile, and guests loved it! they also danced around with the props and costumes, which was fun and unexpected. The prices are competitive. One issue I had was that I did all my emailing and phone calls with Jeff. I think Jeff has a really good sense what I wanted, and said he would communicate all that to Mike. The day of the wedding was crazy, and I didn't get a chance to talk to Mike hardly at all before the wedding. Somehow, not all the information got from Jeff to Mike. There were a lot of announcements I wanted made that didn't get made, and some details were a little out of date. It all got worked out, and I still look back on my wedding as being fabulous and perfect. My advice if you are using this company is to make sure you have time to talk to the DJ who will actually be at your event and make sure they have all the accurate information and know everything you want.

We recently used California Mobile Entertainment for our wedding at Ramekins Culinary school on 11/9/13 for DJ and photobooth services. Firstly, I can say their pricing is competit...

ive for the area and they do a fantastic job! Secondly, all the people who work here are very friendly and we are glad they were part of our big day. My husband spoke to Jeff initially and he decided that we should use them for our DJ services, plus our coordinator had recommended them. Jeff and his other lead DJ Mike worked with us to put together a play list for our special dances and for the evening. Day of, Mike was our DJ. Mike is super friendly and did a wonderful job and always checked with us to make sure we were happy. We had a bit of a unique challenge in mixing all different generations of music plus mixing both Spanish and English. He did a great job of ensuring that there was a nice mixture and we had people on the dance floor all night (all ages too!). It was great! He also did well with accommodating requests and really had a good gauge on our crowd and what to play and when. Rachel is in charge of the photobooth side of the business. She is such a great person and really helped encourage our guests to get into the photobooth and have fun. She had awesome props and the best part was you get unlimited photos and it's a double print. So one goes into a scrapbook where people can sign and the other is a favor for your guests. You also get a disc with all the images, which is nice since not all the photos make it into the book. The scrapbook is such a wonderful keepsake. My husband and I will always be able to look through it and laugh. Our guests also LOVED the photobooth. We got a lot of comments on how fun it was. Thanks to everyone at California Mobile Entertainment for helping make our wedding a blast!

I gave my DJ very little to go on...a limited song list of what my husband and I liked, and a lot of last minute changes for the sound system he was setting up outside for the cere...

mony musician. But they were easy and flexible to work with. And our DJ - Mike - what an awesome guy! He seemed to really understand the crowd. I was worried no one would dance, but my dance floor was never empty! Such an awesome night was had by all! Would recommend to anyone!

;The sound system was not very good. People would cut in and out during the speaches.
