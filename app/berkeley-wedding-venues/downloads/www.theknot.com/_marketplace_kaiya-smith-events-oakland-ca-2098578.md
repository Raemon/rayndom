Kaiya was the PERFECT day-of coordinator for my client's wedding! The minute I met her in person you can tell she is seasoned in this industry and can think quickly on her feet wit...

h new information being presented to her. She is extremely professional, and very sweet and kept that same energy throughout the entirety of the wedding day. Your ideal day-of coordinator not only takes care of the little details, but helps runs a smooth timeline, communicates effectively with vendors during a short time frame, and adjusts/pivots as things arise, and that is exactly what Kaiya did and THEN some. I could not recommend Kaiya enough! You and your special day will be in more than great hands with her on your team!

problem solvers who are incredibly detail-oriented and rigorous, they were instrumental in the success of our special day. Kaiya and her team's day-of coordination and vendor wrangling prior to the event ensured everything ran seamlessly. I would 100% recommend working with Kaiya Smith Events for your wedding or event.

ur timeline, vendors, and must-haves for our weekend. From flowers, to DJ, to cake, and so much more she handled the coordination perfectly. We felt cool, calm, and relaxed to enjoy our special day. We couldn't have pulled it off without her and with our sanity intact. Thanks so much, Kaiya, you crushed it and we can't recommend you enough :)"
