If you've ever fantasized about getting engaged, you've probably envisioned _that_ moment when your partner opens a tiny box to reveal the gemstone of your dreams. But what if the ring isn't what you imagined? It's a valid thought. That's why experts recommend couples try on engagement rings before committing to the purchase. 

We know what you're thinking: Isn't it bad luck to wear an engagement ring before actually getting engaged? While the mere thought of [engagement ring shopping together](https://www.theknot.com/content/engagement-ring-shopping-together) may sound like an etiquette no-no, it's actually encouraged. After all, an engagement ring is a lifetime investment. Since it's a piece of jewelry you'll wear every day, it should be exactly what you want. Now, couples are tossing "traditional" wedding rules in favor of practices that realistically make the most sense. And if you're not sure exactly what kind of sparker you want, why not try on engagement rings to find the perfect one?

FEATURED VIDEO FROM THE KNOT

To break down everything you need to know, we tapped industry experts to share the biggest perks of trying on engagement rings with your partner. And for even more help, we've rounded up the best engagement ring try-on kits to use at home that'll help you pick the perfect ring style from the comfort of your couch.

**In this article:**

  * Should You Try On Engagement Rings?
  * Where to Try On Engagement Rings
  * The Best Engagement Ring Try On Kits



## Should You Try On Engagement Rings?

Fact: You're allowed to try on engagement rings before you get engaged. In fact, experts encourage it. "I always recommend couples try on engagement rings in person before making a decision," says Sara Beth Brown Prendeville, president of [Brown & Co](https://brownjewelers.com/). "There's really no substitute for seeing how a ring looks and feels on your hand, and it's the best way to make sure you get what you want and your partner knows what you want. It turns what could be an intimidating process for some into a really special and memorable experience." 

Not totally sold just yet? Here's why opting to try on engagement rings is a smart move before you make a purchase.

### An Engagement Ring is a Lifetime Investment

It's no secret that an engagement ring comes with a significant price tag. According to The Knot Jewelry and Engagement Study, the [average cost of an engagement ring](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-much-to-spend-on-engagement-ring) is $5,200. Since it's a serious investment, you'll want to make sure the ring is perfect before you buy it. The best way to do this, of course, is by trying on a variety of styles to learn what you like. Doing so will help you decide on important details that have a direct impact on the cost, like the [center stone shape](https://www.theknot.com/content/brilliant-tips-how-to-choose-a-diamond-shape), [carat weight](https://www.theknot.com/content/engagement-ring-diamond-grading), [metal color](https://www.theknot.com/content/engagement-ring-metal-types) and [ring setting](https://www.theknot.com/content/engagement-ring-settings-101). "An engagement ring is a long-term investment; you want to make sure you absolutely love it," says Nicole Wegman, founder of [Ring Concierge](https://ring-concierge.pxf.io/c/64733/863937/12049?subId1=Theknot.com-why-you-should-try-engagement-rings-on-before-you-buy&u=https%3A%2F%2Fringconcierge.com). "Now more than ever, couples are opting to go through the ring-buying process together. While there are plenty of questions that arise when choosing the perfect engagement ring, determining a budget is one of the trickiest."

Once you've made a budget and tried on styles that fit your price range, you'll be confident in your final decision. After all, knowing that your partner loves the ring you purchased—and will look forward to wearing it every day—is priceless.

### It'll Help You Learn What You Like

When it comes to choosing an engagement ring design, your options are quite literally endless. If you're not the person who's had their favorite ring style bookmarked for years, it'll be beneficial to try on a variety of styles in person. Even if you have a general idea of what you think you want, trying on different options is the best way to be absolutely certain. "Oftentimes, shoppers have one image in mind of their dream engagement ring," says Jamie Singleton, President of Signet Jewelers (which houses brands like [Jared](https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8213893-11556226?sid=TK-why-you-should-try-engagement-rings-on-before-you-buy&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jared.com%2F%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOorlwRUwcTuNPSwhCz8j1o57ql88ffQZmh5_95Wjnfrtts4L5u-D), [Kay](https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8213893-11554448?sid=TK-why-you-should-try-engagement-rings-on-before-you-buy&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kay.com%2F%3Fcid%3DSEM-goo-Ecomm%2520-%2520Brand%2520-%2520Top%2520Performers%26campaignid%3D1950372899%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds%26gad_source%3D1%26gad_campaignid%3D1950372899%26gbraid%3D0AAAAADqOWL-FFKpH88Ns0mqRMc4LyLa-s%26gclid%3DCjwKCAjwr8LHBhBKEiwAy47uUitKGk_pf2jM015mcfszoAJ3yYB3bqecTsOMOIknuiA0BcawvFdMnBoCbA8QAvD_BwE) and [Zales](https://zales.com/)). "However, once they see the rings in person and are able to mix and match styles, it really changes their perspective. Some come away with a forever ring that's completely different from the original style they had envisioned. Because of that, we always recommend to our customers to keep an open mind because you never know what you'll fall in love with."

With this in mind, it's recommended to try on a variety of styles to get an understanding of what you love. Do you prefer a yellow gold or rose gold band against your skin? Would you rather wear a solitaire engagement ring, or a design with multiple side stones? Are you into [trending diamond engagement ring shapes](https://www.theknot.com/content/engagement-ring-trends), like marquises and pears, or do you want to keep it classic with a brilliant round or emerald? With so many options on the market, testing them out in person is the best way to pick your favorite.

### Rings Can Look Different In-Person vs. Online

Some couples may prefer to [shop for an engagement ring online](https://www.theknot.com/content/should-you-buy-your-engagement-ring-online). Not only is this a convenient option, it can also be budget-friendly too. Some online-only brands are direct-to-consumer, which eliminates extra fees you might encounter in stores. But while there are certain perks that come with shopping online, know that rings can look different on product pages than they do on a real hand. "It's very common for clients to realize they like a different diamond shape or style on their hand when they try on rings in person. Even I had that experience," Prendeville says. "I was sure I wanted a classic round, but once I started trying on diamonds, I fell in love with an emerald cut instead. You really can't know until you see it on your hand. I'd compare it to wedding dress shopping: What you love in photos might feel totally different when you see it on yourself." 

## Where to Try On Engagement Rings

By now, you should be convinced that trying on engagement rings before you buy is the right move. But when you're ready to window shop, where do you go?

### Visit Your Local Jeweler

The first, and arguably most obvious answer, is to try on engagement rings with your partner in a store. Many fine jewelry retailers allow you to browse styles in a showroom, which can serve as a fun date night activity. Start your search with a platform like [The Knot Vendor Marketplace](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/jewelers) to find local retailers in your area. By choosing to try on engagement rings in a store, you'll get personalized attention and guidance from an experienced jeweler, which can be helpful if you don't know what you want or how to find a style in your budget.

### Order an Engagement Ring Try-On Kit

If you can't make it into a store to try on engagement rings, do it from the comfort of home with an engagement ring try-on kit. Some retailers allow you to customize a box with replica rings (made of metal alloys and CZ material, not diamonds) to help you experiment with different styles and shapes. Prices can range anywhere from $20 to $200, and the cost is often a refundable deposit or can be used as credit toward your engagement ring purchase. 

### Consider A Virtual Engagement Ring Try-On Experience

When all else fails, consider a virtual engagement ring try-on experience. While it won't be as interactive as an at-home engagement ring try-on kit or an in-store appointment, many jewelry brands have developed virtual technology that allows you to upload photos of your hand and see what rings look like digitally. 

[Our Favorite Virtual Try-Ons](https://www.theknot.com/content/virtual-engagement-ring-try-on)

"For a refundable $99 deposit, the customer will receive a kit that includes three center stone settings and three ring mountings. Customers can try on the rings for seven days before returning the kit."
