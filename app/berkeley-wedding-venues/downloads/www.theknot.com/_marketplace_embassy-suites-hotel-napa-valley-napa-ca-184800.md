We had a room block at embassy suites for our guests and hosted our rehearsal dinner there. We had an amazing experience- the staff were very helpful with coordinating our room blo...

ck and worked within our budget to make the rehearsal dinner reasonable. Although we had initially planned to host the dinner outdoors, when it started raining, they quickly transitioned everything indoors seamlessly. We did a taco style buffet which was delicious and open beer/wine for which they provided a surprisingly great wine selection. The hotel itself is additionally beautiful with a very scenic pond that has a swan. Would highly recommend!!
