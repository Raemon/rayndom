Katie Atsatt

Lead Photographer

Katie here! Lover of cats, coffee, and books. When it comes to wedding photography, yes, I love taking amazing photos. But what I really love is connecting with clients and making sure they have the best day ever. It is important to me that on your day, you get to focus on you and your partner. Whether that is getting you water, helping organize the fam, or holding your dress while you pee (oh yeah).

Devin Atsatt

Lead Photographer

Before meeting Katie, I was photographing real estate and products. She brought me into the wedding world and I never went back! Besides taking photos, I enjoy spending my days learning about construction on YouTube and being an old man. (Katie may or may not be writing this)

After I got engaged, before I even had a venue picked out, my best friend recommended Katie and Devin to me as potential photographers for our big day! I took one look at their ins...

tagram and INSTANTLY knew they were the ones. We immediately booked an engagement shoot with Katie, and the photos were STUNNING. I had never been photographed professionally (and my husband has only been once) so we were both a little nervous because we didn’t know what to expect. Katie made us feel comfortable and kept us laughing the entire time which made for amazing candid shots! She knew exactly how to pose us and by the end of the session all of our nerves went away! This was a perfect “practice” session for the wedding day because by then we were already familiar with Katie and Devin and super comfortable, so the shyness was completely gone! Katie not only helped me nail down a seamless photo schedule, but also a shot list (both for just us and the family photos) and with some other wedding planning questions I had! Her expertise came in clutch and she made sure everything ran smoothly and according to plan on the day of! They are a fantastic team and having two photographers made all the difference! While Katie was with us ladies getting ready, Devin got some great shots of the guys! And during the ceremony and reception, they were able to get twice as many shots from different angles to get the most incredible photos and candids of our family and friends! Both my husband and I were able to live in the moment on our wedding day and walked with confidence knowing that our photography team was killing it with the photos! Even the posed pictures look natural and they NAILED every single shot! Our family and friends are raving with how amazing they are! Both the photos and Katie and Devin themselves! Katie and Devin even got my “wish list” shots that I was nervous they wouldn’t come out as nice as the inspo pictures because of the cloudier weather the day of. I was so incredibly wrong because they came out even better!! We are so thankful for Katie and Devin going above and beyond on our wedding day to capture memories to last a lifetime. We will definitely be using them in the future for any other family photos or events! Love you guys!

Working with Katie and Devin was one of the best decisions we made for our wedding. They are incredibly professional, talented, and genuine. From the moment we saw their work, we k...

new we wouldn’t be able to book anyone else. Every meeting leading up to the wedding was thorough and helpful, and they never once made us feel like any question or concern was silly. They work seamlessly as a duo, capturing the most beautiful and meaningful moments throughout the entire day. As a bride, I could not be more thankful for Katie. She has a calming presence that truly makes you feel confident and at ease during all the wedding-day chaos. She consistently went above and beyond to make sure I was okay, and her knowledge and experience really shine through when things get hectic. My husband also loved working with Devin while the guys were getting ready. He felt Devin’s ideas were fun and creative, and the groomsmen were able to let loose and enjoy themselves while still capturing incredible moments. If you’re considering booking them—don’t hesitate. Katie and Devin are exceptional at what they do, and we feel so grateful to have had them as part of our day. Highly, highly recommend!

Highly recommended. We ran across Katie and Devin's booth at a wedding fair and were immediately drawn to their candid, artistic and warm style with excellent capture of movements ...

and life. We much preferred it over classic wedding photos that feel still, posed or staged. They were so good at capturing our personalities, and the feel of the moment. We absolutely love our album. My wife usually doesn't like her photos so it says a lot. We also loved their calm, fun and easy going personalities. It was surprisingly important, as they were the ones we spent the most time with on our wedding day, which was inevitably busy and stressful. They were also a pleasure to work with through the planning process. They were super responsive, caring and great problem solvers. They went far and beyond to help us with planning like vendor recommendations and site visits.

ommodate our late schedules as well as responding quickly to any questions that came up between meetings. When it came to the wedding day, they showed up with best energy and it made for such a fun, easy photoshoot to get the nerves out before the ceremony. They went above and beyond by checking in on how we were doing throughout the night and were always so quick to offer help for anything we needed! We were stoked to receive our photo gallery exactly one month from the date of the wedding, and were completely blown away by the quality of our photos! Each picture perfectly captures the essence of our wedding, and we will cherish these for the rest of our lives! We would highly recommend booking with them, you will not be disappointed!
