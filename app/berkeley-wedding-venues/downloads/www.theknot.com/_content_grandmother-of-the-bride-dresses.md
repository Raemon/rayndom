## Grandmother of the Bride Outfit Etiquette and FAQs

If this is your first grandchild to get married, you may be wondering what qualifies as appropriate grandmother-of-the-bride wedding attire. Below, we dive into the details of what makes for exceptional wedding outfits for a grandmother of the bride.

### How Do You Choose the Best Grandmother-of-the-Bride Outfit for the Occasion and Your Personal Style? 

As the grandmother of the bride, you deserve to look and feel fabulous, and that means choosing an ensemble you genuinely love. While personal style is paramount, there are a few etiquette standards to keep in mind. "The grandmother of the bride should follow the dress code, just like any other guest," Loscalzo says. "But if they're slightly overdressed, that is okay as well, since they are considered an honorable guest."

FEATURED VIDEO FROM THE KNOT

While dresses are the standard for cocktail or black-tie events, they aren't your only option. Loscalzo suggests mix-and-match separates for a "more modern" option, and adds that a sleek [pantsuit](https://www.theknot.com/content/grandmother-of-the-bride-pantsuits) can be equally sophisticated. Ultimately, comfort and mobility are key. Because you'll likely be walking down the aisle and appearing in many family photos, your outfit shouldn't hinder your movement. If a floor-length gown poses concerns about tripping, a high-low hemline or an ankle-length dress is a perfectly appropriate and stylish alternative. 

Don't forget to consider the venue and season. Breathable linen or cotton are ideal for summer, while plush velvet offers warmth for winter. Regardless of the season, Loscalzo recommends a chic "just-in-case" layer. If the dress doesn't already come with one, consider purchasing a shawl or formal cardigan. Venues can get chilly, and a coordinated layer ensures you'll stay comfortable from the ceremony to the final dance.

### What Color Should the Grandmother of the Bride Wear?

Grandmothers of the bride are an integral part of the wedding party. While you don't need to match the bridesmaids, choosing a gown that complements the wedding's color scheme will distinguish your honored role and ensure family photos look beautifully coordinated. When in doubt, Loscalzo suggests leaning toward timeless palettes. "Soft, classic colors are encouraged," she notes. "For a spring or summer wedding, I recommend pastels, whereas for a fall or winter wedding, I would suggest shades of blue or deeper jewel tones."

### Are There Different Rules for the Bride vs. Groom's Grandmother?

The good news is that there is no formal etiquette that requires distinguishing the grandmother of the bride from the [grandmother of the groom](https://www.theknot.com/content/grandmother-of-the-groom-dresses). However, to ensure both feel unique and celebrated, it's wise to ensure they don't arrive in the same ensemble. "I recommend for the bride to keep the flow of communication open just to make sure they both feel special, but also wear different colors and styles of dresses." Loscalzo says.

Whether you're a bride helping your grandma find the perfect wedding ensemble or you're shopping for yourself, our curated list of stylish grandmother-of-the-bride dresses ensures you'll find a gown fitting for the matriarch of the family.

Many brides and their grandmothers prioritize grandmother-of-the-bride dresses with jackets to ensure comfort, whether facing a breeze outdoors or a venue with the air conditioning on full blast.

There's no need to hunt for a coordinating wrap, because this dress for a bride's grandma includes a matching shawl. Crafted from lightweight floral burnout chiffon, the dress is perfectly suited in both style and structure for an outdoor spring or summer ceremony. The cowl neckline and graceful V-back offer a balance of modesty and charm, while the subtle high-low skirt flows effortlessly with every step. As the evening cools, drape the matching scarf over your shoulders for a polished finishing touch.

**Size range:** 6-18

For something more understated, but still attention-catching, try this Betsy & Adam gown. Made of a thick and stretchy crepe scuba fabric, it's surprisingly comfortable for a form-fitting dress. It comes in a few different colors and despite being a one-shoulder, still offers plenty of coverage.

**Size Range:** 2-18

Taupe is anything but boring. This versatile neutral serves as the perfect canvas for the blush blossoms found all over this structured gown. The bodice is subtly embellished with sequins and features a V-neckline that leads to an empire peak waist to lengthen the torso. Our favorite part, though? It has pockets!

**Size range:** 0-22W
