There was once a time when a wedding veil felt like an essential part of a bridal look; It was the finishing touch that, even in a dressing room, could make fiancés feel like brides and moms and BFFs begin to cry. But with the number of veil alternatives that have accompanied New York Bridal Fashion Week's [wedding dress trends](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-dress-trends) over the past few seasons, it's safe to say the sheer layers of lace and tulle are officially taking a backseat to accessories that can provide the same effect in a more modern way.

Maybe you're having the [veil or no veil](https://www.theknot.com/content/is-veil-on-wedding-day-necessary) debate, or maybe you're searching for an of-the-moment way to elevate your ceremony look. Whatever the case may be, the wedding veil alternatives that follow are sure to please any bride looking to go the nontraditional veil route. From minimal silk neck scarves to cascading capes, detachable trains and dramatic overskirts, we're doing a deep dive into the five most popular anti-veil trends straight from the NYBFW runways—plus inspo and ideas to nail the look yourself.

  * The Anti-Veil Trend
  * Top Wedding Veil Alternatives for 2025




## The Anti-Veil Trend

Among the flurry of [trending bridal accessories](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-accessories-trends) seen at New York Bridal Fashion Week, the anti-veil and its many iterations easily left the most lasting impression on our editors. "More brides are opting for veils that are not just ceremonial, but functional," says Anna Ramirez, head of design at [Pronovias](https://www.pronovias.com/wedding-dresses). "Think veils that double as capes, jackets, or even detachable trains." While the trend graced the runways in a variety of forms, many of which one could argue would still pair well with a traditional veil, what they all had in common was that they didn't need one to feel complete. Nadia Manjarrez, for example, topped a strapless drop-waist dress from her seventh collection with a floral-embellished, floaty tulle scarf that pooled into an elegant train. At Pronovias, the anti-veil trend appeared in the form of a long, off-the-shoulder cape bordered with a row of bold, oversized blooms. Both of these looks were, without a doubt, wedding day worthy—even without veils.

While couture bridal trends can feel unapproachable for real to-be-weds, this one is anything but. Alternative bridal veils are rooted in practicality—not just because they eliminate the need to put a metal comb into your hair, but also because they seamlessly allow for two looks in one. They can take a single dress from minimal to dramatic, provide additional warmth during outdoor ceremonies and add modest coverage for religious ones. But the anti-veil trend isn't just wearable—it's fun. "It's all about what makes you feel amazing on your big day and completes the look," says Caroline Thorpe Goldberg, bridal stylist and founder of [Little White Looks](https://littlewhitelooks.com/). "Brides have continued to reach out of the box for their bridal looks, and veils are no different." To show you what we mean, we've rounded up a list of the top five takes on the trend, along with a few shoppable products and images of brides without veils to inspire your own look.

## Top Wedding Veil Alternatives for 2025

And now, the top five alternatives to wedding veils you can expect to see all over your Instagram feed this year.

Scarves | Capes | Jackets & Dusters | Detachable Trains & Skirts | Bold Bows

### Scarves

While scarves have been trickling into the Western bridal fashion scene for the past few seasons now ([AnnaSophia Robb's](https://www.theknot.com/content/danielle-frankel-celebrity-wedding-dresses#:~:text=AnnaSophia%20Robb's%20Wedding%20Dress&text=The%20bride%20donned%20%22Anika%2C%22,and%20a%20gauzy%20neck%20scarf.) ethereal Danielle Frankel look is a memorable one), the trend is rooted in centuries of South Asian aesthetics and traditions. It's heavily influenced by the dupatta, a staple in [traditional Indian attire](https://www.theknot.com/content/what-to-wear-indian-wedding) that symbolizes modesty and grace and is often seen as a sign of respect, especially in the presence of elders or during religious ceremonies. But beyond its cultural symbolism, the dupatta is a versatile fashion accessory that adds grace, color and drama to an outfit. "The bridal scarf trend in South Asian weddings—often a modern reimagining of the traditional dupatta or chunni—has become a powerful fusion of fashion, heritage and symbolism," says Reena Mathur, Indian jewelry designer and founder of [ReeMat Designs](https://reematdesigns.com/). "Many brides now embroider their partner's name, wedding date or a mantra into the border of their bridal scarf. Some wear heirloom scarves from their mother or grandmother, creating a bridge between generations."

Bridal designers have recently debuted stunning takes that effortlessly combine this rich cultural history with Western styling. The trend made a major appearance at NYBFW in the recent collections of Lihi Hod, Mark Ingram, Nadia Manjarrez, Sassi Holford and more. From long tulle versions adorned with 3D florals to simple silk and gauze options, the neck scarf is one of the most approachable takes on the anti-veil trend—its effortless drape and flowing train feel just as bridal as a traditional veil but a little less fussy than the [hair accessories](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-hair-accessories) and strategically placed bobby pins they require.

### Capes

Pronovias, Marco & María and Hera Couture are just a few of the designers that showcased [wedding dress capes](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-dresses-with-cape) on recent bridal runways, and the style variations were endless. Whether ultra-sheer, off-the-shoulder, embellished with ribbon and lace appliqués à la [Naomi Biden](https://www.theknot.com/content/danielle-frankel-celebrity-wedding-dresses#:~:text=Speaking%20to%20Vogue,in%20Jackson%20%5BWyoming%5D.) or topped with a hood à la [Lily Collins](https://www.theknot.com/content/celebrity-wedding-dresses#:~:text=Lily%20Collins%27%20Wedding%20Dress), the elegant and sophisticated vibe they each share is undeniable. "Dramatic cape veils bring pure elegance and grandeur," says Ines Di Santo founder and designer of the namesake brand. "Flowing like a regal train, they create a stunning, goddess-like presence, especially with sleek gowns or intricate lace." One of the best things about this veil alternative is its practicality, allowing for a bit of additional warmth and coverage for virtually any wedding dress silhouette—along with an easy way to transform your look post-ceremony.

### Jackets & Dusters

A mainstay in the collections of Alexandra Grecco and Jenny Yoo, dusters and jackets that flow into long, floaty trains have the unique ability to add sleeves _and_ the vibe of a veil to any bridal ensemble. This is an especially fitting veil alternative for the bride who's torn between an understated look and a dramatic one, as the easy-to-wear layer can seamlessly transform even the simplest of dresses into something bold and daring. You'll find ruffly, lingerie-inspired options that double as getting-ready robes at Grace Loves Lace, while Alexandra Grecco offers sheer, ultra-detailed overlays brilliantly designed to coordinate with brooches and other outfit-making accessories.

### Detachable Trains & Skirts

With each and every Bridal Fashion Week, convertible wedding gowns only seem to become more and more innovative. Over the past few seasons, we've seen countless dresses from the likes of Savage and Hunt, Tony Ward La Mariée and Justin Alexander Signature completely transform with the removal of a seemingly attached train or overskirt. Whether you want to add dramatic volume or a sheer layer of length, these alternatives to veils provide a seamless way to do so. And while they can certainly still be worn with a veil, they can just as easily replace one for brides who want to keep things less complicated.

### Bold Bows

We're no strangers to an oversized bow, but we're also well aware that it's a daring choice for those afraid of commitment. Luckily, designers showcased detachable bows in all kinds of innovative ways on the latest NYBFW runwayas—Nadia Manjarrez and WONÀ Concept flaunted theirs at the back of the neckline, while Sareh Nouri and Anne Barge chose traditional placements at the waist. Julie Vino went for a more modern approach, demonstrating her take on the trend as a chic topper that delicately drapes off the arms. But each feels similar in the way it trails behind the gown, giving the effect of a traditional veil's full and glamorous train.
