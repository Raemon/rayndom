## Top Trending Wedding Hair for 2026

Recently, I've noticed a shift away from the boho hair styles that once dominated the wedding scene (like beach waves and braided updos), and towards more classic, simple styles (like slicked-back buns and uniform waves). This transition comes as viral internet trends, such as the "quiet luxury" and "clean girl" aesthetics, continue to have an influence on the beauty landscape. Now more than ever, nearlyweds are searching for wedding hairstyles that are elegant and timeless, but not over-the-top in a way that could distract from their outfit. [Sarah DeVore](https://www.instagram.com/sarahmdevore/), co-owner at [Aura Salon](https://www.instagram.com/theauraexperience/), master stylist, and [Milk_Shake](https://us.milkshakehair.com/) pro artist agrees. "I think that a more classic look is what we are moving towards in the industry over overly curled and pinned styles," she says. "The blowout, sleek buns and chignons are all timeless styles that are being appreciated once again."

Bear in mind, just because a particular hairstyle is trending, doesn't necessarily mean it's the right one for you. Bridal hairstyles for 2026 can certainly influence your final look, but they're by no means a blueprint you have to follow. When it comes to picking out your wedding hair for 2026 nuptials, you should focus more on your personal style, not just the current wedding hairstyles that are trending. "I always tell brides to think about how they feel most confident on a regular day and then to elevate from there," says [Sherri Ann Cole](https://www.a-frameagency.com/artists/us/hair/sherriann-cole), celebrity hairstylist and [Göt2b Curled](https://www.got2b.com/) brand ambassador. "Your wedding look should feel like the best version of _you_ , not a stranger."

So, how do you figure out which look feels the most like _you?_ It's simple, really: Book a wedding [hair trial](https://www.theknot.com/content/prep-for-hair-and-makeup-trial). "Your stylist cares more than you can ever imagine about how your hair makes you feel on your wedding day," says DeVore. "Doing a trial run lets you discuss with your stylist the styles you are drawn to, the styles they believe would be good for your facial structure and hair type, and the ones that are currently trending." Doing a bit of research beforehand never hurts either, and that's exactly why I put together this list. So, pull up a chair, relax and get ready to check out the top bridal hairstyles 2026, including intricate updos, [Black wedding hairstyles](https://www.theknot.com/content/black-wedding-hairstyles) and even some ideas for the groom. **Psst:** If anything catches your eye, you can save it to your [Favorites](https://www.theknot.com/your-favorites/inspiration) page by tapping the heart in the top right hand corner.

One style we can expect will make its way from the red carpet to the wedding aisle in 2026 is the updo with face-framing bangs. It's timeless, chic and pairs well with just about every wedding dress style. Not to mention, there are countless variations of this 2026 updo hairstyle, meaning you can achieve it with virtually any [hair length](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-hair-type-tips) and texture. Whether you're searching for [updos for long hair](https://www.theknot.com/content/updos-for-long-hair) or [wedding hair to wear with a veil](https://www.theknot.com/content/long-hairstyles-with-veils), you can't go wrong with this look. "Updos with face-framing bangs combine elegance with a bit of relaxed texture, making them perfect for a bridal look," says Los Angeles and New York City hairstylist, [Waz Shaiwayana](https://www.instagram.com/itswaz/), and personally, I couldn't agree more.

## 2\. Hollywood Waves

If you loved [Demi Lovato](https://www.theknot.com/content/demi-lovato-engaged-wedding)'s wedding hair, you'll love this latest bridal hair trend. Voluminous, structured waves (AKA: Hollywood waves) have recently replaced beach waves as one of the most trendy hairstyles for weddings in 2026. "Hollywood waves offer a more polished and refined look, making them ideal for formal weddings," says Shaiwayana. According to Los Angeles hairstylist [Sharon Yadegaran](https://www.instagram.com/sharon_yad/), however, they're versatile enough for any type of event. Simply put, "they offer the drama and glamour that beach waves can sometimes lack," she adds. This modern bridal hair style is achieved by creating uniform curls with a large-barrelled wand, which are then brushed out and sprayed with hairspray for a sleek finish.

## 3\. The Sleek Bun

Like I mentioned earlier, sleek wedding hair is the rage right now, and hair experts would tell you the same thing. "In no less than 24 hours after Sofia Richie's wedding, I styled my first '[Sofia Richie bun](https://www.theknot.com/content/sofia-richie-wedding-hair),'" says Cassi Ramona, owner and lead stylist at [Reverie Beauty NYC](https://www.reveriebeautynyc.com/). If you haven't heard of the Sofia Richie bun, I'll break it down for you: This sleek wedding hair style took the internet by storm following the celebrity's 2023 nuptials and has shown no signs of slowing down ever since. The reason so many nearlyweds are gravitating towards the sleek low bun is perhaps as simple as the style itself. "I personally see brides trending away from styles that require a lot of maintenance and moving towards more relaxed, effortless choices," Ramona reveals. "The slicked-back bun not only lifts and defines the face but also gives a polished, put-together look, whether you're walking down the aisle or running errands," says Shaiwayana.

## 4\. Half-Up, Half-Down

![Half-up half-down wedding hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/892e664b-e90f-4bae-bb74-13d8e90ef840~rs_768.h-cr_0.180.1080.1620)

If you're an indecisive bride who can't seem to [choose a wedding hairstyle](https://www.theknot.com/content/choosing-a-wedding-day-hairstyle), this current bridal hairstyle offers the perfect compromise. "Half-up, Half-down styles are great because they give you the best of both worlds," says Peyton Lambert, Los Angeles hairstylist and founder of the [Peyton Lambert Collective](https://peytonlambertcollective.com/). "Brides are able to customize their look with the amount of hair they pull up." she adds. According to Shaiwayana, "brides can also personalize their half-up, half-down style by adding braided details, loose waves or curls, textured volume or even a slicked-back half ponytail." Not only does a half-up, half-down look fit virtually any bridal vibe, it's also great for accessorizing (Psst: There are countless [bridal hair accessories](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-hair-accessories) to choose from). "A half-up half-down style is the perfect way to support a veil, but depending on your style, you could even add a [veil alternative](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-veil-alternatives), like flowers, a crown or decorative pins/embellished clips," says Atlanta hairstylist, Madison Bohannan.

Where timelessness meets practicality, you'll find the classic bridal ponytail (or what I like to call the "party pony"). "If you've ever been on a dance floor with your hair down you know just how irritating it can be to be weighed down by your hair," says Bohannan. Enter: The [wedding ponytail](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-ponytail-hairstyles). "This latest wedding hair look is great for brides that want the comfort of having their hair out of their face while also maintaining hair length," says Bohannan. "Not only does this style work with almost any bridal look, but it will also last throughout the entirety of your big day," says Yadegaran. According to Lambert, an unfussy style like a ponytail can be a great way for brides to highlight their natural beauty. All in all, "getting the hair out of the face allows for a worry free all-day style," she explains.

We have influencer [Matilda Djerf](https://www.theknot.com/content/matilda-djerf-relationship) to thank for this 2026 bridal hair trend. When the fashion and beauty creator announced her engagement, fans immediately started to speculate what her wedding hairstyle would look like. The obvious answer? _Her iconic bouncy blowout._ Experts agree that this look, often called the '90s blowout, makes the perfect bridal hair for 2026 to-be-weds. "The '90s blowout gives that timeless and effortless glamour," says Cole. "It's the perfect blend between nostalgic and modern, plus it photographs beautifully from every angle!" A stylist can help you achieve this sought after look, but if you're attempting it on your own, the key is to let your curls set in rollers for as long as possible before walking down the aisle.

So far, we've talked a lot about classic styles that brides will be leaning into in 2026, but what about the unconventional bride that wants to make a statement on their big day? I believe we'll see many of them opt for a bright, bold hair color to contrast against their white or monochromatic wedding attire. DeVore agrees with this prediction. "We are seeing brides being more daring and stepping away from some of the traditional looks when it comes to color on their wedding day. I foresee some soft baby pink and purple colors being brought into the hair to accent the gowns that are trending," she says. What makes a wedding the perfect place to debut your new look? Well, according to Wendy Burns, Lead Stylist at Henkel, the bold bride might seek to reinvent their entire look at the same time that they debut their new last name.

Social media's viral "clean girl aesthetic" is all about celebrating the beauty of simplicity, whether that means opting for light makeup that highlights your features instead of hiding them, or dressing in simple, understated styles that aren't overly flashy. When it comes to modern wedding hairstyles, that might mean skipping the straightener and embracing their natural curls instead. "Most brides want to keep true to their everyday look but feel a bit more done up," says Los Angeles hairstylist, [Sydney Stiff](https://www.vagaro.com/us02/sydneyraehair). Cole predicts we'll see an increase in brides wearing their natural hair to weddings this coming year "I see curly brides leaning into styles that are romantic, soft and true to their natural texture. From textured updos to voluminous curls with delicate accessories. It's all about the balance between elegance and authenticity," she says.

## 9\. The Textured Quiff

![Textured quiff wedding hair](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/163e6d17-36b0-43d8-b604-de588e3c056f~rs_768.h)

The textured quiff has been a coveted look for grooms since…well, as long as I can remember. It was first made famous by rock and roll legends like Elvis Presley and James Dean, and today celebs like Harry Styles and Austin Butler are carrying the torch. If you want to achieve this timeless style on your wedding day, DeVore recommends starting with damp hair and applying a generous amount of texturizing spray. "Blow dry it into the hair creating lift where needed," she explains. Next, apply some texturizing dust and, "use your fingers in a claw-like motion, or a wide tooth comb, to start placing the hair in the desired position. By using your fingers or the wide tooth comb, you will create texture, movement and separation into the style," she says. Pro tip: Burns recommends finishing off the look with a colored thickening spray. "It can add more texture, cover grays and even give a thickening effect for the big day," she reveals

## 10\. The Tapered Fade

Another [men's wedding hairstyle](https://www.theknot.com/content/men-hairstyle-ideas) I'm expecting to see make a comeback from last year is the tapered fade. As one of the most popular haircuts for men, it makes sense that many grooms are gravitating towards this look. A tapered fade is achieved when the hair is buzzed shorter at the nape of the neck, and longer the closer it gets to the top of the head. The result is a clean look that appears to fade right into the skin. "Since the style is relatively low-maintenance, it's perfect for laidback grooms," says Bohannan. All you'll need to do to get wedding-ready is comb through the top part of the hair, and apply a pea-sized amount of pomade to keep flyaways in check.
