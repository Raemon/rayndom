Please learn from the mistakes of others and NEVER trust Shayna Azevedo. Calling her a professional is a joke and her business is a total scam. If you want the short version of thi...

s review, here it is: Shayna canceled on me the day of my wedding, sent a replacement who could not honor my $300 deposit that I already paid her and is now refusing to return my deposit even though she is the one who canceled on me! I booked Shayna for wedding day makeup and hair services. Like many other poor reviews on yelp stated, I experienced huge delays in response times and had to keep following up with her just to keep things moving. That should have been my first red flag warning but I tried to be more understanding as she said she was a single mother trying to run a business. I figured the other reviewers were just overreacting. I finally got the contract and paid a $300 deposit to secure my date. I went in for a trial five days before my wedding and paid an extra $200 for this. The makeup look I walked out with did not look professionally done at all. She didn’t even put primer on my face so the foundation immediately started settling into the fine lines of my face, making them much more pronounced. The eye makeup she did on me starting transferring within an hour of being done, leaving me with dark smudges around my eyes. This trial should have been my second red flag but at this point I was less than a week out from my wedding and already signed a contract. We chatted about what worked and what didn’t work (which is the whole point of a trial) and she said she would come a bit early on the day of to make sure we got it right. The day of my wedding I received a text message from a random number saying that she received my number from Shayna and not to worry that I was in good hands. I was so confused because I had received zero communication from Shayna so I reached out to her asking what was going on. It wasn’t until then that she told me she had an emergency she was dealing with and that this other person was a coworker of hers that would be filling in for her. I was left to trust a total stranger with my wedding day look. It wasn’t until after all day of services had been performed that I was informed that Shayna and the replacement person she sent were two separate businesses and that my security deposit could not be honored. I had to scrape together extra money to pay the replacement and was told to ask Shayna for a refund on my deposit. I reached out to Shayna about the return of my deposit and she ignored me for several days. I tried to be patient and understanding, thinking that she may still be dealing with this emergency situation of hers. But then I see her post stories on Instagram! I called her immediately and was sent to voicemail so then I texted her again and also contacted her on Instagram. Finally, I got a response out of her saying that the deposit is non refundable under any circumstance. THIS HAS SCAM WRITTEN ALL OVER IT! So if you sign a contract with Shayna Azevedo you are accepting the fact that should she decide to cancel on you for any reason at all, she still gets to keep your deposit. Do not trust this woman! She gives small business women a bad name.
