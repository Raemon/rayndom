We had our wedding and reception here in August. The venue's event coordinator, Michelle, was fantastic. When we first toured the venue, she had mentioned that August tends to be w...

indy. We were worried but it turned out to be a gorgeous day - too hot at times perhaps! The venue has sweeping panoramic views of Berkeley, San Francisco, and the whole bay. It's stunning to watch the sunset and see the moon rise. Our guests loved the venue and space. The indoor is as beautiful as the exterior- one of many reasons we chose this venue. That way, if weather was bad or there was smoke from fires, we could do our ceremony indoors and it would still be beautiful with a view. Michelle was incredible throughout the process - so much so that we did not need to hire a wedding planner. She was easy to communicate with, fun, knowledgable, and super helpful day of. Her entire staff was stellar. Highly recommend.
