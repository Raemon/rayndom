Sean Kurtela

Owner

I have been shooting and editing video for around twenty years. What started as a hobby has turned into a dream job. I have been married since 2015 and am a father to two lovely little girls. I love what we do and nothing gives me more satisfaction than seeing our couple's reactions to their wedding videos.

We truly cannot say enough good things about Sean and his team. From the moment they arrived on our wedding day, the four of them brought such a calming, grounded presence that all...

owed us to fully enjoy every moment. They were incredibly easy to work with, professional yet casual, and made the entire experience feel effortless. The final video absolutely blew us away. The storytelling, the emotion, the pacing -- everything was beautifully done. The drone footage was a huge bonus and really elevated the film, capturing the setting and energy of the day in a way that still gives us chills. What made this experience even more special was their communication and care after the wedding. They delivered our video by Christmas Day, which felt like the most meaningful gift. Being able to watch and share it with our families during the holidays is something we’ll cherish forever. If you’re looking for a videography team that is talented, kind, calming, and truly invested in their couples — hire these guys. We are so grateful we did. :)

s completely respectful of that without sacrificing any quality. He was easily one of our most low maintenance vendors, and we only needed a couple texts and a quick phone call to get on the same page and make all our arrangements. We had hired a separate photography team and they all worked seamlessly together - photographers and videographers got all the shots they needed and didn’t have any conflict. We got both the highlight film and several complete videos (ceremony, first dances, etc). They all looked really professional and had a great pacing (good variety of angles and shots, but didn’t switch too quickly between them). We’re really glad we worked with Sean and his team and will treasure these videos on anniversaries to come!

I had watched a close friend's wedding video and knew I wanted to hire Sean before I even met my husband. My friend had him as her wedding videographer and I loved his calm, friend...

ly demeanor. When I saw the video, I knew I would hire him when I got married. Sean has a great artistic eye/vision and was excellent at capturing every little detail of our day. He did a fantastic job of directing us and making sure he got ever shot he needed the day of. We were blown away by the thought and attention he put into his work. I was truly so so happy we hired Sean. Not to mention, he was extremely gracious when we needed to postpone our wedding from September of 2020 to September of 2021 due to the pandemic. If you're on the fence about hiring a videographer, hire one! It's one of my favorite things to watch and relive our special day. Thank you so much, Sean!

I can't say enough good things about Sean and I highly highly highly recommend him. I chose the package to include the wedding ceremony, wedding reception and the short film of our day and they all turned out amazing and well worth every penny!

t issue. We're so glad that he did too because the finished product he gave us was 10/10! He captured every important moment and told the story of our wedding. His balance between traditional and modern is something I think will stand the test of time. Thank you again for literally EVERYTHING you've done for us Sean.

After hearing from several friends and family members that their biggest wedding day regret was not hiring a videographer, I knew this would be a must for my wedding. And because m...

y best friend kept raving about how much she loved her videographer (I was in her wedding in 2015 and 100% agreed), it was an easy choice for me to go with Sean Kurtela. After moving our wedding twice because of the pandemic, he continued to be flexible, professional, and super responsive. His entire team came on time and ready for the long day. We were so impressed by how many team members he had to assist, ensuring we didn't miss capturing any of the many magical moments that day. Not only did he make a highlight video that had everyone in tears when I posted it on IG, but he also went above and beyond to make sure we were happy. Sean's easy going, down-to-earth personality is so refreshing in an industry that can be so pretentious (particularly in Wine Country, CA). We loved that the footage he captured came together in the most sincere and sweet highlight video with so many different angles and shots, without being corny at all (like many wedding videos can be). We already plan to watch our wedding video at every anniversary. We really can't recommend Sean enough! Do it. You won't be disappointed.

If you’re questioning hiring a videographer…don’t think! Just say YES! Sean and his team did an incredible job capturing the true joy of our wedding day! We hired Sean back in 2019...

and he was so easy to work with when the pandemic forced us to postpone. With the ever changing rules of COVID he was flexible and able to adapt to our needs. Sean and his team were professional, fun, and helped keep the day flowing. It is a true gift to be able to look back at the footage and relive a day that means so much to us! Thank you Sean and the entire team for capturing our love - we are forever grateful!

ant factor when couples are spending 8-12 hrs with their photo/video team. He works well with photography teams, and doesn’t have the ego I have seen with other videographers over who is more important. A true team player when it comes to other vendors. Their videos are beautiful, and my clients have always been happy afterwards. He is on my recommended vendors list, and I absolutely love when my clients book him!

After having canceled our destination wedding due to Covid-19, my husband and I decided to plan a small local wedding at a beautiful bay area venue called Nestldown. Quite frankly,...

we were on the fence on whether or not we would hire a videographer. Sean came highly recommended by our venue so we decided why not explore the option. Sean was extremely prompt in communication and very open to discussing options with us given the unusual circumstances of 2020. We are so happy we decided to work with Sean and cannot imagine not having the beautifully captured footage from our special day. We were amazed at Sean's ability to capture such high quality footage at so many different view points. He is highly skilled and certainly had creative solutions to capturing a significant amount of footage, despite our shorter wedding (4 hrs), even though he was our only videographer filming for the day. We've looked back at our wedding videos many times in the past 6 months and every time are reminded how thankful we are to have to have these moments captured forever. If you are on the fence, I encourage you to do it - you will not regret it! Also, Sean is fantastic and I would highly recommended him. Thank you Sean for capturing such lovely memories for us for a lifetime!

the couple, but also of all the people who made our day special. On top of this, Sean pivoted with us when our wedding plans changed due to COVID. He was always careful and safe in his planning but completely supportive, flexible, and positive during a stressful time. The day-of Sean and his team were a pleasure to be around and gave us just enough direction while most often being somewhere without us even realizing they were recording. After the event, Sean's turnaround time with our video was quick, and I can say that the end result was worth the investment! I can't recommend Kurtela Video enough!
