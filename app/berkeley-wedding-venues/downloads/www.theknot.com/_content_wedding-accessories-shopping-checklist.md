These days, couples love switching up their look between their ceremony and reception, but what if we told you there was a way to do so without purchasing multiple outfits? "Swapping out your wedding accessories is an easy (and effective) way to change your look without having multiple dresses or complicated outfit changes," explains [Jennifer Behr](https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=2406622&u=1030781&m=146209&urllink=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Ejenniferbehr%2Ecom%2F&afftrack=tk-wedding-accessories-shopping-checklist), accessory designer and owner of the namesake brand. "Brides can easily swap out a classic ceremony veil with a sparkling headband, or change out of subtle pearl earrings into big crystal chandelier silhouettes to give their gowns a fresh and fun party look for the reception," she says. "Grooms can just as easily switch out accessories—changing a boutonniere into a crystal brooch that matches the bride is a fun way to change up the look of a tux from ceremony to party!" But when it comes to deciding on accessories, or rather, multiple to swap out throughout the day, where do you even begin? Below, you'll find a comprehensive list of wedding accessories to consider for your big day. You can bookmark the handy-dandy infographic to have on hand while shopping for your wedding wardrobe.

## What Accessories Do I Need On My Wedding Day?

So, what wedding accessories do you absolutely need? Well, it mainly comes down to your personal style. A maximalist, for example, will have a much lengthier list of wedding accessories than someone who prefers a minimalist aesthetic. Regardless of your style, we recommend incorporating accessories into your wedding wardrobe in one way or another. "Accessories are what people notice when they look at someone—both in person and in photos," says Behr. "The eyes are drawn to the face and what's around it, so it's worth splurging on accessories like a pair of earrings, and a matching brooch for the groom," she explains. "Investing in accessories that you love can really make wedding outfits more fun, individual and special!"

In addition to personal preference, your culture may also influence what accessories and [jewelry you choose for your wedding](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-to-pick-jewelry-to-match-your-wedding-dress). Indian weddings, for example, call for an abundance of [Indian wedding jewelry](https://www.theknot.com/content/indian-wedding-jewelry), while [Nigerian weddings](https://www.theknot.com/content/nigerian-wedding-attire) are a great opportunity to wear a gele. 

Consider booking a bridal accessory appointment with a [wedding stylist](https://www.theknot.com/content/working-with-a-wedding-stylist) to help you finalize your look and answer questions like [veil or no veil](https://www.theknot.com/content/is-veil-on-wedding-day-necessary). **Psst:** you can use [The Knot Vendor Marketplace](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace) to find a wedding fashion expert near you.

## Wedding Accessories for the Bride

After saying "yes" to the dress you can start to think about what kind of [wedding dress accessories](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-accessories-trends) you'd like to finish off your look with. The options are virtually limitless, making the decision tough, but we can help with that. This bridal accessories list outlines all the essentials for your wedding day.

### Engagement Ring and Wedding Ring

The first two items on this list should be no brainers: your engagement ring and wedding ring. You'll likely want to [wear your engagement ring on your wedding day](https://www.theknot.com/content/wear-engagement-ring-during-ceremony), so plan on packing it along with the rest of your bride accessories. You might, however, entrust a member of your wedding party with the task of holding on to your [wedding band](https://www.theknot.com/content/rules-for-choosing-your-wedding-bands) until it is time to hand it off to the ring bearer.

### Hair Accessories

[Bridal hair accessories](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-hair-accessories) have the power to transform your entire look. Whether you decide to go for something classic like a wedding veil, or a [veil alternative](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-veil-alternatives), such as a [bridal headband](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-headband-ideas-photos), hairclip or [tiara](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-tiaras), you can't forget about these elegant extras. There are countless options when it comes to bride hair accessories—You might even decide to wear a veil during your ceremony, then swap it out for other bridal accessories for hair later on in the day.

### Shoes

Another essential bridal accessory for weddings? Shoes, of course! Because you'll be on your feet throughout the day, it's important to choose a comfortable pair of shoes to match your bride accessories for the wedding. Best [wedding shoes for brides](https://www.theknot.com/content/best-wedding-shoes) include heels, wedges, platforms, sandals, flats and so much more—basically any pair that reflects your personal style! If you opt for stilettos during the ceremony, we recommend changing into your dancing shoes (a.k.a. [comfortable reception shoes](https://www.theknot.com/content/comfortable-reception-shoes?)) later on.

### Jewelry

Good news for all the brides who love bling: Your [wedding jewelry](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-jewelry) isn't just limited to your engagement ring and wedding band. Depending on the style of your dress, you might consider some additional sparkly accessories, like [wedding bracelets](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-bracelets-by-style) or [necklaces for brides](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-wedding-necklaces). Likewise, your wedding hairstyle will help determine the [best earrings for your wedding dress](https://www.theknot.com/content/earring-and-wedding-dress-pairings).

### Garter

You can't have a [garter toss](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-garter-tradition) without, well, a garter! If you're planning on taking part in the long-standing wedding tradition, you'll want to add a wedding garter (or set of garters) to your bridal accessories checklist. Pro tip: Opt for the set so you can toss one garter and keep the other as a memento.

### Clutch or Purse

You might be wondering where to store all these wedding accessories for brides, and rightfully so. When it comes to keeping your bride accessories for the wedding day all in one place, we recommend purchasing a [bridal clutch](https://www.theknot.com/content/unique-bridal-clutches) or purse. You can store other wedding day essentials in it as well, like makeup, tissues and blotting pads.

### Cold Weather Accessories

We're willing to bet that your go-to winter coat won't match your wedding gown, and that's okay. If you're getting married outdoors in the fall or winter, there are plenty of stylish cold weather accessories you can layer over your look. [Wedding jackets](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-day-jackets), [bridal shawls](https://www.theknot.com/content/winter-wedding-coats-wraps) and [bridal capes](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-dresses-with-cape) are all great options since they add warmth without distracting from the overall aesthetic of your gown.

### Trendy Bridal Accessories

Still feel like your wedding wardrobe is missing something? Why not try on some trendy bridal wedding accessories to see what fits your vibe? Some wedding accessories brides are currently loving include [wedding gloves](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-gloves), draped neck scarves, embellished [bridal belts](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-belt-sash-ideas) and even [bride sunglasses](https://www.theknot.com/content/sunglasses-wedding-accessories). 

![Bride putting on earrings](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/2b047387-9500-47bb-8d4a-0097977f1f65~rs_768.h-cr_0.92.1092.1548)

## Wedding Accessories for the Groom

You don't think we'd forget about the groom now, did you? While suiting is pretty straightforward, the real challenge comes with picking [groom accessories](https://www.theknot.com/content/must-have-groom-accessories). Suit accessories for weddings can vary depending on whether you're wearing a tux, suit or something totally different. Here, we're breaking down everything you need to know in this list of wedding accessories.

### Engagement Ring and Wedding Ring

Since part of your ceremony will involve exchanging rings with your partner, you don't want to forget these essential accessories for the wedding. When it comes to [men's wedding bands](https://www.theknot.com/content/best-mens-wedding-bands) and [engagement rings for men](https://www.theknot.com/content/engagement-rings-for-men), the same advice from above applies: Have a member of your wedding party hold on to the rings until it's time to hand them off to the ring bearer.

### Necktie or Bow Tie

If you've already started your search for wedding suit accessories, you probably noticed that the world of [wedding ties](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-ties) can be quite complex. There are so many [types of ties](https://www.theknot.com/content/types-of-ties) to choose from, each meant to be paired with a specific style of suit. When in doubt, talk with a wedding fashion expert at your local suit store. They can help point you in the direction of a tie (and a [wedding tie clip](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-tie-clip) if needed).

### Pocket Square

When it comes to groom suit accessories, [wedding pocket squares](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-pocket-squares) aren't a necessity, but there are plenty of reasons why you may want to consider wearing one. Pocket squares have the power to tie your whole look together. On top of that, they come in handy during emotional moments at the altar.

### Cufflinks

Did you know that you can instantly upgrade your look with a pair of [wedding cufflinks](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-cufflinks). That's right—these small wedding accessories make a big difference in your overall look. If you're wearing a tuxedo, consider investing in a pair that reflects your personal style.

### Belt

One of the essential suit accessories for weddings that should never be overlooked is your belt. It plays an important role relating to both fashion and function. Remember: If you decide to take off your suit jacket for the reception, your belt will show, so choose one that pairs well with your outfit.

### Shoes and Socks

Like we mentioned above, shoes are an essential wedding accessory for both brides and grooms. If you decide on a pair of lace-up [groom shoes](https://www.theknot.com/content/super-stylish-grooms-shoes), loafers or boots, you'll also be tasked with finding a pair of socks to go with them. Neutral tones are always a safe bet, but if you want to level up your look, choose a pair of socks in a color that matches your tie or pocket square.

### Watch or Jewelry

Want to add even more wedding day accessories to your look? Consider opting for a bit more bling by way of a [wedding watch](https://www.theknot.com/content/mens-wedding-watch) or other pieces of jewelry. Not only will you look extra sharp at the altar, but you can also wear them after your wedding to remember your big day.

### Suspenders

Whether you appreciate the support they give, or you just love vintage-inspired styles, [suspenders](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-suspenders) make a great addition to your wedding wardrobe. They'll have you looking super suave when you take off your jacket for the reception.
