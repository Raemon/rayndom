We had an incredible experience using DJ Saint Patrick for our wedding!! He brought an incredible energy and professionalism to our event -- we loved how detailed his pre-wedding i...

ntake form was and how many opportunities we had to provide input on song selections for different parts of the event. Our dance floor was probably the highlight of our wedding thanks in large part to Patrick's energy and some of the excellent remixes he brought out to surprise and delight us and our guests! By hiring Patrick you're hiring a real DJ with a gift for entertaining on the dance floor -- we felt super lucky to have the opportunity to work with him. We also really appreciated how he helped us to time the event well and keep all of the different parts of the evening on track, from moving us along from cocktail hour to dinner, to keeping the speeches rolling, to moving everyone smoothly into the dance floor portion. Plus he is just super nice and a great person to correspond with and collaborate with. We would not hesitate to recommend Patrick for any event!

I would 100% recommend Patrick and Golden State Productions for your wedding. They DJ-ed at my sister's wedding in 2013, and I knew I had to hire them for my own wedding 3 years la...

ter. Patrick is truly a professional, and makes the planning process so easy and care-free. He used online questionnaires and phone calls leading up to the wedding, that account for all the details, so you don't have to worry on the wedding day. His DJ style is not cheesy at all, and he really makes sure your wedding night flows smoothly. His music style appeals to everyone; All my guests were on the dance floor all night! Patrick definitely makes sure the music fits your taste though and can customize however you want. He not only managed the music for the reception, but handled the sound for my ceremony. Even with my outdoor ceremony on a super windy day, everyone could hear the speakers perfectly! I also ordered the photo booth, and it was so much fun, and went so smoothly; and we even got a flash drive of the photos that night. Overall, I can't say enough great things about this company; no complaints; my wedding was so fun, stress-free and flowed perfectly because of DJ St. Patrick!

Neither my wife or I have had much experience with DJs and didn't really know what to expect or what to look for. We ended up going with Golden State Productions and DJ Patrick bas...

ed on the recommendation of our venue. DJ Patrick got back to me quickly and soon scheduled an initial phone consultation to get an idea of what we were like and the type of music we liked. He was very easy to talk to, laid-back, and just gave off the impression that the most important thing was for us to enjoy this experience. They also provide a google docs spreadsheet that was very helpful for thinking about what music is needed when and helped us to build our playlist. He would also provide gentle reminders to complete the form which was again helpful as we often pushed this task to the back... 2 weeks before our wedding, we had a phone conference to run through everything. It was immediately clear that he had done his preparation, reviewed the spreadsheet, and even searched for, downloaded, and listened to the individual songs that we had chosen for the wedding party to walk out to. During this conference call, we were able to run through a detailed timeline and he was able to give some suggestions about timing of events which we found helpful. We were also relieved he was not at all judgmental about our somewhat eclectic taste in music. On the day of, he arrived well in advance of our start time and was set-up rapidly. The microphones/speakers for the ceremony and reception were set-up clearly so all our guests could actually hear the vows, thank-you speeches, and toasts. Throughout the day, he would check in with us in terms of timing and to help with transitions to the slide-show, cake-cutting, and first-dance. We were actually very nervous about the dance party as only some of our friends actually dance. However, with him manning the music, people seemed to really enjoy themselves and actually a lot of people danced until the very last song. All in all, it was a great experience. We would highly recommend going with Golden State Productions.

Patrick was, hands-down, the best vendor we had (outside of our event planner at the hotel). He spoke with us several times before the wedding (we live out of town, so meeting in p...

erson wasn't an option). We spoke for almost an hour once we had completed his online planning form so he could make sure he knew what we wanted. We had a small wedding, and he warned us that it would be hard to keep the dance floor full the entire time, which we completely understood. He said he'd try his best to gauge the mood of our guests. Well, that he definitely did! He kept our guests dancing from the first song to the last! He took our requests and didn't play any of the songs on our "do not play" list. He also did the music for our ceremony, as well as some additional lighting for the tent at the Oceano. The music level was perfect, the song selection was great, and he did a wonderful job. He was, without a doubt, worth every penny that we paid for him. We can't say enough good things about him!

DJ Saint Patrick was one of the best things to happen to our wedding! We actually planned our date around hiring him. We found him through another wedding we attended, and what we ...

loved about him was that he ran the show without making it obvious. He kept our timeline throughout the night and played all our favorite songs. His online template makes it super easy to organize the songs you are interested in hearing throughout the night. We had compliments on our DJ all night and continue to receive them. Thanks so much Patrick!

th guidance and suggestions. We got raves about the music and had a great time dancing all night and the photo booth was perfect for our guestbook and was roomy to get lots of fun group shots. Also, getting a CD at the end was such a nice touch, we listen to it and reminisce all the time.

Patrick is absolutely amazing! The music during the ceremony, cocktail hour, dinner and reception was perfect and more than I could have ever hoped for. Patrick is very thorough ...

regarding the type of music that you want for your event and also goes through the entire wedding timeline. Another plus was the fact that Patrick kept our entire event on track and on time. He would also check in on my husband and I to make sure we had everything we needed. He is such a sweet and nice person and has a lovely personality. Words could never truly capture my gratitude! I would highly recommend Patrick – you will not be disappointed!

Patrick is wonderful. He is so fun. He did everything thing that we asked. He was so helpful in everything that was planned. I would recommend him to anyone!

What a great DJ! The planner online you use to select your music is so easy to use and helps keep you from going crazy with what songs you have to have, and all the details of when...

to play what song. The ability Wayne has to keep with the party instead of freight training over the mood is perfect. He checked in with us before, during, and after the reception to make sure the volume was right, music selections were ok, and if we wanted to play anything special other than our requests from the planner. WE chose to have a select few to speak with the mic and he kept it under control. (THANK YOU!) It saved us time for dancing and fun instead of everyone getting a chance for their "five seconds of fame." I had also asked on the planner to not allow requests from guests to keep the mood the way my husband and I wanted it. He had no problem explaining that it was at my request, and handled it very professionally. The lighting he sets up is just enough to not be a disco, but is still fun. He was dressed professionally for his age, clean and neat. He's not an old fat guy in a tux from the 80's! Again, just the best DJ you'll find in the area.
