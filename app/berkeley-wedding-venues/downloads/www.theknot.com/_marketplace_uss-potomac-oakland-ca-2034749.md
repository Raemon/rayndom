Celebrate your wedding day on San Francisco Bay aboard the historic USS Potomac, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's fully restored presidential yacht. At 165 feet long, with three decks, we offer three-hour cruises on San Francisco Bay for up to 110 guests, or dockside charters where the ship does not leave the dock. You can depart from and return to Jack London Square in Oakland, he Ferry Building in San Francisco, or in Sausalito. Say "I do" on the bow of our ship or on the upper boat deck, then enjoy your reception as we cruise the Bay. We work closely with your vendors to create a very memorable, special experience that is unlike any other venue in the Bay Area.

It was a wonderful experience. I was disappointed that one young couple in their 30's, grabbed two prime seats, despite 90% on board we're senior citizens, and never offered anyone a seat for the entire cruise. Also pushed to get off the ship ...

If you are visiting San Francisco, or live here like myself, this is a must. The USS Potomac is a beautiful ship with great history that is easily accessible from San Francisco. A 25 minute ferry ride across the to Jack London Square and a sho...

rt walk brings you to FDR’s Presidential yacht. The staff and volunteers are extremely knowledgeable, friendly, and professional. If you wish to see the beautiful views of the San Francisco Bay on historical ship, this is your ticket.

Historic yacht, lovingly maintained by volunteers. It's a great glimpse into the past and history of the United States of America. If you can, she still sails for cruises around the bay, and is well worth a visit. Just remember to wear warm clo...
