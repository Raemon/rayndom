Working with All Seasons was such a highlight of our wedding planning process. From the initial tasting onwards, the team was incredibly professional, sincere, THOUGHTFUL! During t...

he tasting, the team included a floral arrangement integrating our wedding colors. It's these little touches that really go a long way. The tasting was absolutely delicious. My parents were in town at the time and we often talk about how lovely an experience it was. Above all, All Seasons food is next level. So many of our guests commented on how delicious the food was along with the beautiful presentation (edible flower petals delicately sprinkled in our butter dishes...truly just too sweet.) During the wedding, the team was incredibly organized, friendly, and timely! Can not say enough about All Seasons. If you're considering working with them, you will not regret it!

I'm a wedding planner that had a client use All Seasons for their 115 guest count wedding a few days ago. The entire process working with All Seasons was astounding. From the initi...

al tasting, All Seasons went above and beyond to make sure every detail about my clients wedding was represented, going so far as to bring in floral arrangements that matched the color scheme. Once we confirmed we were going to use All Seasons for my clients wedding, Rachael, Gay and Stan were on top of every detail to ensure everything went off without a hitch. During the day, we heard nonstop about how delicious the food was and how beautifully presented it was. The service was top notch and the dinner portion of the wedding went off without a hitch and directly on time for what we had planned for (which never happens with weddings). I'd use All Seasons Catering for all of my clients weddings and would highly highly highly recommend them for your wedding or event!

We had a great experience working with Rachael and All Seasons Catering during our (rescheduled) COVID wedding, and the food could not have been more beautiful and delicious. So ma...

ny guests made a point of telling us how wonderful our wedding food was, and we completely agree! We love the fact that our wedding food is something we will always remember about our day, and it helped show off the amazing flavors and ingredients of the season for both our local and out-of-town guests. From the appetizers to the bar to the amazing service and food, All Seasons Catering aced it. Rachael was so responsive, organized, and supportive throughout our 2 years of wedding planning during a pandemic. She even found a way to serve our non-conventional dessert of ice cream sandwiches and ensure that they would get eaten and not just melt into a pile. She also made sure to bring us a plate of appetizers while we finished up our family photos, which was so thoughtful and appreciated. Even with a day-before change to the tables and most likely many other things that we didn't even know about, the ASC team handled everything so calmly and with such warmth and attentiveness. They truly made our evening beautiful, delicious and relaxing, and we loved having them as part of our much-awaited wedding!

All Seasons Catering did a fantastic job catering our very hot (110 degrees!) wedding at the Outdoor Art Club in Mill Valley. Amy and Stan were very accommodating and flexible to o...

ur menu customizations (tacos, grilled cheese, and pizza) and we received many compliments on the food. Their waitstaff was very attentive (knowing whether each guest had been previously served red or white wine). My only criticism is that sometimes the communication was delayed or lacking in the handoff from Amy to Gay. Somethings had to be re-explained (overtime hours and linen orders), so I found myself having to triple check invoices for accuracy when things were getting down to the wire. That aside, All Seasons Catering made our date memorable and I highly recommend them for your special day!

food was from All Seasons, even a week after our wedding. We served hangar steak, salmon and the DELICIOUS ravioli family style - which was great because everyone could try everything. The appetizers were unique and delicious as well. Also, Gay and Stan and the All Seasons team were with us every step of the way and were super helpful in keeping everything organized before and during the big day. I highly recommend All Seasons Catering - they made our wedding meal unforgettable!

food and as a day of planner. Overall, All Season Catering was flawless. We served our guests family style, which was the best way I've ever seen food served at a wedding. Everyone was eating at the same time, including the vegetarians, vegans, and gluten-sensitive guests. Here we are two months later and people are STILL raving about how great the food and service was. Amy was our day of planner, and I do not know how we could have possibly pulled off our wedding without her. She was always happy and professional, and took away all the stress of the day. We truly were able to just simply enjoy our wedding day. I was especially impressed with her incredible ability to remember every face in our huge family, so pictures were a breeze. The timing was absolutely perfect (I guest even noted that the program was followed exactly with the stated times).

onsive, and very collaborative. Their food is beyond delicious! Our wedding guests are still talking about how much they loved every bite they tasted. In addition to being super yummy, their food presentation is impeccable, and the portions are actually enough to leave you feeling full. This is not your ordinary wedding caterer! Their menu is expansive without being overwhelming, and the options offered satisfy everyone, from the picky eater to the foodie. We loved everything we ate, and when we left our wedding at the end of the night, All Seasons had put together a delicious takeaway bag, filled with sweets and a few leftovers to enjoy later that night. My husband and I recommend All Seasons Catering. Gay and Stan are thoughtful and very easy to work with.

our menu choice tasting to venue walk through to the reception was the smoothest and most professional of our entire wedding experience. We had passed appetizers and a giant cheese and fruit platter outside near the bar all beautifully presented and attended to by the staff. The dinner, from an amazing salad to piping hot entrees were fabulous. Although we tried very hard to keep to our schedule for ceremony, pictures, toasts and speeches we could not. All Seasons Catering being the pros they are adjusted to our delays seamlessly. Truly amazing! The delicious food and incredible staff made this day perfect for us, memorable for our guests and even impressed our wedding planner. Thank you Stan, Gay and staff for a wonderful day that will not be forgotten. Cheers!

All Seasons Catering catered my friend Abbie's wedding at Cline Cellars Winery in Sonoma. They had the most amazing kobe beef sliders as appetizers with an aioli sauce to die for! ...

Usually, I don't like to eat chicken at weddings because it is so dry, but their tuscan chicken was so moist and had a scrumptious Boursin cheese in the center of it! More importantly, I was so impressed with the service of their staff. They had positive attitudes, professionalism, and were attentive to all our tables throughout the entire night.

The food and service were stellar! Later in the evening they brought out a beatiful Smores Bar filled with River Rock and it had 8 burners in it so 8 people could make Smores at one time. They also had homemade Square Marsh Mallows and Graham Crackers that All Seasons made them selves, they were so classy and beautiful. The Smores Bar was a comlete hit! We could not have been happier. All Seasons was a pleasure to work with from beginng to end. It was an excellent valur for the money spent.

o not only have amazing food, but quality of service and also that little extra touch. Stan, who owns the company with his wife Gay, is an amazingly creative chef and came up with a delicious menu that my guests still talk about. And Gay was my unofficial wedding planner, she is extremely organized, helpful and kind, so together they make a great team. They were so easy to work with and even recommended a local florist and baker for the wedding, which I ended up using. They also have a great staff that handled the wedding professionally and extremely friendly. I was amazed to see the food displays at the four stations I had for dinner. To my surprise there was not a metal chaffing dish in sight, everything was beautifully presented and kept hot and fresh by the waitstaff. I love that they went the extra mile and that they cared about the presentation and quality just as much as I did. (I have worked in the food business in for many years and can identify when quality is overlooked). I can't express how happy my husband and I are with our wedding day and I give All Seasons the credit for making the day go so smoothly and taking care of us. Our night even ended with a little gift basket from them that included a bottle of champagne, pieces of our wedding cake and containers with food from dinner which was greatly appreciated as we recounted the day in our hotel room. I would use them again if we had another wedding! But I'm pretty sure I will be attending more weddings they put on because most of my girl friends have already decided they will be using All Seasons Catering for their weddings!

We can’t say enough about how happy we were with “All Season’s Catering.” From the 1st meeting and 1st bite – we LOVED the food! Stan and Gay are warm and clearly enjoy their work....

They are seasoned professionals who are true experts. They were flexible with menu options and talked us through the different choices to create a menu that would be perfect for our wedding. Leading up to the wedding day they were available over e-mail for questions and advice. Two months before the wedding – we went on a venue walk-thru with our vendors so we were all on the same page. Fortunately, they were very familiar with the space and knew all of the ins and outs since they had catered many other weddings there, and gave great advice. On the day of the wedding- our friends and family couldn’t stop talking about how AMAZING the food was! From the appetizers to the salad to the main course- everything was perfect!!! Even some of our most difficult to please “foodie” friends loved the food. 3 days later – my cousin told me we had the best food she’s ever had at a wedding. WOW!!!!! We were so happy to take care of our family and friends in this way and pleased that they enjoyed everything as much as we did during the tasting. To top that off- Stan and Gay gave us a beautiful basket with a care package of food from the day that we ate at midnight that night which was perfect since we didn’t get a chance to eat much during the wedding. If you get a chance to work with All Seasons Catering for your wedding – it’ll be one of the best decisions you make!

ving the best food and presentation plus, when all was said and done, turned out to be the medium priced of the three. The menu consisted of three passed hors d'oeuvres, Coconut-Ginger PrawnsTomato-Basil Bruschetta Served On Garlic Crostini & Seared Sesame Encrusted Ahi Tuna Served On A Wonton Crisp With A Wasabi Aioli. The full sit down dinner with a pre-set salad of Baby Spinach With Fresh Raspberries, Toasted Walnuts & Sweet Red Onions Tossed With A Raspberry-Walnut Vinaigrette,with a choice of two entrees for our guests, the Sesame Crusted Salmon Served With An Orange-Ginger Vinaigrette or the New York Strip With A Portabella Mushroom Sauce. Our guests were seated, toasts were made, salads were eaten and cleared then the main courses came flowing into the dining room by a most professional staff. With our families and friends quickly served I turned to my new wife saying listen to that! Looking across the dining room it was silent except for the clinking of silverware to plates. The food was so delicious and presentation so stunning our guests are still talking about it with some commenting it was the best they ever had! After a few photos at the cake table the All Seasons staff handled the cake service flawlessly as they did our fabulous dinner. Working with Stan & Gay Vail, the owners, from the planning stages, the many changes, last minute ajustments including their advice on what works best, through the wedding itself was a pleasure. We can't thank them enough for our incredible and memorable wedding. Thank you again Stan, Gay and staff, thank you very much!

d it's a few weeks out from our wedding!! We actually went to a wedding in 2009 and ASC was doing the catering. We kept raving with the other guests at that wedding that the food was ridiculous... When Dave and I decided to get married in the same town, we knew we absolutely had to go with All Seasons! Stan is an extremely talented chef and his wife, Gay, is incredibly organized for the actual event. They took care of everything- we didn't even need a wedding planner! They organized renting tables, linens, china and silverware, glasses, etc. Gay provided guidance about timing and the flow of the night. The day of, their staff was incredibly attentive and the bartender was fabulous! We had 4 "stations" set up for our guests to mingle and help themselves multiple times to freshly made food by the chefs on the spot. You can start drooling over our menu now: -Salad Station: 1) Fall Panzanella Salad with Baby Arugula, Baby Spinach, Sweet Red Onion, Caramelized Butternut Squash & Panzanella Croutons. Drizzled with a Warm Honey Vinaigrette. 2) Italian Couscous, Pesto Orzo, Baby Garbanzo Bean, Quinoa & Sweet Corn Salad. Served with Dried Cranberries, Toasted Slivered Almonds & a Champagne Vinaigrette -Steak Station: Roasted New York Steak Served with Blackberry Ketchup, Garlic Lime Aioli & Horseradish Crème Vineyard Potatoes: Yukon Gold, Garnet Yam and Baby New Red Potatoes Oven Roasted and Tossed with Italian Parsley, Olive Oil, Garlic and Lemon Zest -Seafood Station: 1) Fresh Grilled Salmon Tacos Vera Cruz with Fresh Salsa & Green Olives 2) Mahi Mahi & Rock Shrimp Ceviche with Avocado & Cucumber -Pasta Station: 1)Butternut Squash Ravioli With Browned Butter & Sage 2) Rotini Pasta with a Fresh Basil Pesto & Oven Roasted Tomatoes mmmmhmmmm..... delicious!!! ... and their prices are completely appropriate! Gay and Stan and their staff really care and truly provided the best night of our lives. Don't look any further~ and congratulations to you!
