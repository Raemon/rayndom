Every year, I see big shifts in the wedding world, specifically what couples, VIPs and guests love. But I've noticed that the changes from last year's mom looks to the mother-of-the-bride dresses for 2026 are subtle. Slight adjustments are made to honor of-the-moment colors, patterns and fabrics, but silhouettes remain classic and flattering. "Mother-of-the-bride dress trends often reflect bigger industry and seasonal trends," Nicole Carrabine, the owner of [The Lake Forest Shop](https://thelakeforestshop.com/) on Chicago's North Shore, a go-to boutique for mothers of to-be-weds, says. "The MOB trends are less driven by bridal trends and more by what's hot that year. But, mostly, they're driven by what's most flattering for the client: the mother of the bride."

In fact, couples today want to ensure their mothers look and feel their best. "We're finding that the traditional cardinal rules have relaxed a bit," Carrabine says. "A dress from one of our designers, [Audrey + Brooks](https://www.audreybrooks.ca/), [went viral](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C9Nnyg0pdwP/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=M2M0Y2JmOTAyOA%3D%3D) because the mother of the bride's dress was a showstopper. There were some comments questioning if she was upstaging the bride, but her daughter loved her mother's dress and called it 'perfect.' Clearly, that's all that should matter."

It's one thing to know what's trending, but another to know how and [where to buy mother-of-the-bride dresses](https://www.theknot.com/content/where-to-buy-mother-of-the-bride-dresses). Carrabine strongly suggests shopping in person. (You can see where to try on gowns near you on [The Knot Vendor Marketplace](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/bridal-salons); enter your location, then click the "dress types" and "mother-of-the-bride dresses" filters.) "Shopping in person allows the mother-of to try on many different silhouettes to ensure she finds the one that's most flattering and, even more importantly, the one she feels most comfortable in," Carrabine says.

Keep reading to see Carrabine's and other knowledgeable stylists and salon owners' predictions on what's going to be trending for mother-of-the-bride dresses in 2026. (By the way, their thoughts will also apply to mother-the-groom outfits.) I've also included shoppable options for each trend, so you can find inspiration and the perfect dress all in one place.

## Top Trends for Mother-of-the-Bride and Groom Dresses in 2026

"Special occasion dress collections take cues from runway trends," says Allison Kaplan, the founder of [Mother Of](https://motherof.co/), an online resource for MOBs and MOGs. "Based on recent designer collections, we're seeing more modern draping and signs of maximalism in the form of sequins, brocades, bows and ruffles. But a wedding isn't the time to go overly trendy—those photos will be around for many years. You're better off choosing a timeless style with modern touches that, most importantly, you feel comfortable wearing." 

Brands know this, Kaplan adds. So, while there are subtle shifts and new collections each year, many stick to the classics. "Many brands popular with MOBs feature some of their bestselling styles year after year. Think: Sachin & Babi's [Brooke](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=9ibcrDa*U1o&mid=52872&u1=TK-mother-of-the-bride-dress-trends&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sachinandbabi.com%2Fproducts%2Fbrooke-gown-powder-blue-bouquet) gown or Amsale's [one-shoulder draped bodice gown](https://amsale.com/products/p707m-fuchsia)—worn by Gayle King for her son's 2024 wedding—because they're known to flatter," Kaplan says. 

I would be remiss if I didn't point out the number-one trend I've noticed at real weddings—and it doesn't involve wearing a specific fabric or silhouette. What's all the rage right now: Moms feeling free to be themselves. "Overall, moms are moving toward embracing their own style rather than sticking to tradition," [Carla Rockmore](https://www.tiktok.com/@carlarockmore), a Dallas-based fashion influencer and designer who champions self expression for those 50 years old and up, says. "It's such a special moment for them too, and their outfits should reflect that." 

One last thing before you look at [mother-of-the-bride dresses](https://www.theknot.com/content/mother-of-bride-dresses-available-now) and [mother-of-the-groom dresses](https://www.theknot.com/content/mother-of-the-groom-dresses) for 2026: You need to log in to your The Knot account. By doing so, you'll be able to save your top picks to [Your Favorites](https://www.theknot.com/your-favorites/inspiration) (just click the heart icon on each photo) so you'll remember to buy one (or more) of the beautiful outfits later. 

**Top MOB & MOG dress trends for 2026:**

  1. Halter Necklines
  2. Soft Fabrics
  3. Dazzling Metallics
  4. Focused Embellishment
  5. Column Silhouettes
  6. One Shoulder
  7. Cape Details



## 1\. Halter Necklines 

Are you a mom that loves to show off your shoulders and arms? Then "halter mother-of-the bride or groom dress" is the number one filter you need to click while online shopping. "Some moms are wanting to show off their shoulders or upper back with halter dresses. Bonus: These dresses are great for weddings anytime of year," Deborah Collins, the owner of [The Dress Matters](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/the-dress-matters-springfield-pa-950178), which has been open for more than 11 years, says. I love this trend, since mothers of all shapes and sizes can look great and feel confident in a halter-style dress. The main aspects you have to consider when finding the perfect halter for you is your bust size, how much of your back you want exposed and what halter style you want, like high neck or empire seam. 

### Halter Gown With Rose Print

![Blue rose print halterneck maxi mother of the bride dresses from Sachin & Babi ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/19afc279-0539-4ff2-b747-164c0d0f42ad~rs_768.h-cr_0.209.1400.2076)

If you're looking for a MOB or MOG dress for a spring or summer wedding in 2026, this crossover halter with a rose print is the one for you. My favorite part of this [garden-style mother-of-the-bride dress](https://www.theknot.com/content/mother-of-the-bride-dresses-outdoor-wedding) is the cascading tails that add grace and fluidity to the look. Plus, you won't need to wear a necklace given the eye-catching neckline.

**Size range:** 0–14

### Halter Maxi Dress With Sleeves 

![Red halter long sleeve maxi mother of the bride dresses from ELOQUII ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/ad776ac1-a9c7-4ffc-99ba-9033f3b68fe8~rs_768.h-cr_0.62.1380.1902)

_[Photo: ELOQUII](https://www.eloquii.com/products/keyhole-front-maxi-dress/1108396.html)_

Available in Tango Red and Night Sky, this stretchy knit jersey piece would be a great [mother-of-the-bride rehearsal dinner dress](https://www.theknot.com/content/mother-of-the-bride-rehearsal-dinner-dress) or fit for a casual event. Even though this dress has sleeves, which are ideal for a fall or winter celebration in 2026, it has cutouts in the shoulders for a subtle reveal.

**Size range:** 14–32

[$110 | ELOQUII](https://eloquii.pxf.io/c/64733/2101829/26536?subId1=TK-mother-of-the-bride-dress-trends&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eloquii.com%2Fproducts%2Fkeyhole-front-maxi-dress%2F1108396.html)

### Halter Dress With Keyhole Detail

![Black halter keyhole mother of the bride dress from Phase Eight](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/4ba386e1-9d31-4b73-a993-e5c06ca0f098~rs_768.h-cr_0.27.1000.1360)

There are a lot of great aspects to this comfortable 2026 mother-of-the-bride dress. From its cute keyhole detail in the front to the tie belt that perfectly accentuates the waist, this flowing frock is a good option for those who want to look relaxed, yet stylish. 

**Size range:** 4–14

### Gathered Halter Midi Dress

_[Photo: Karen Millen](https://www.karenmillen.com/us/polished-tailored-halter-neck-gathered-midi-dress/BKK27422.html)_

Show off your arms and back with this scoop-neck halter. I love the vibrant fuschia color for a 2026 summer mother-of-the-groom or bride dress, and the modern, gold cuffs that gather and drape the dress over the right hip. 

**Size range:** 2–12

## 2\. Soft Fabrics 

I'm not surprised that mother-of-the-bride trends for 2026 spring and summer weddings will prioritize airy materials—who doesn't love feeling comfortable during the warmer months? "Sheer lightweight fabrics, like chiffon and organza, are highly sought after," Julie Mersine Romeli, owner of the bridal and occasion salon [Mira Couture](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/mira-couture-chicago-il-504264) since 2014, says. "So many weddings are held outdoors, and not just the ceremonies—often the receptions are held partially or fully outdoors as well. Mothers don't want to wear a heavy, stiff, bulky gown all day in 80˚ weather. We love the movement of soft, flowing chiffons for walking down the aisle, dancing and blowing in the wind. And organza is a perfect fabric to create lightweight volume; it looks fabulous when pleated and can be used to create artful architectural elements."

### Ruffle Shoulder V-Neck Chiffon Gown

![Mac Duggal ruffled chiffon dress](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/3ddc9986-e07e-4753-bf5c-65eb2014255c~rs_768.h-cr_22.0.801.1039)

_[Photo: Mac Duggal](https://macduggal.com/products/48856_mint)_

"Many mothers are opting for chiffon, as it's light and flowy," Collins says. That said, I had to include a chiffon [mother-of-the-bride outfit](https://www.theknot.com/content/mother-of-the-bride-attire) on this list. What's great about this dress is that there's interest in the shoulder area to make it unique, but the rest is simple. In this V-neck style, lightweight chiffon is pleated at the bodice, ruffled down the skirt and gathered into a statement floral on the shoulder.

**Size range:** 0–16

### High-Neck Organza Overlay Gown

![Pink floral high neck organza mother of the bride dresses from STAUD](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/e7fd318f-6bab-4b9d-bd2d-e3c737345470~rs_768.h-cr_0.103.1179.1675)

_[Photo: STAUD](https://staud.clothing/products/calluna-dress-magenta-painted-floral-1)_

If you're looking for trendy mother-of-the-bride dresses, STAUD's famous organza overlay dress is a stunning and great option. (Fear not: Modest details, like the high neck and short sleeves, offset the sheer fabric.) It comes in a range of colors and patterns—my favorite being the Magenta Painted Floral as a [bridal shower outfit for mom](https://www.theknot.com/content/mother-of-the-bride-bridal-shower-attire).

**Size range:** XS–XL

[$495 | STAUD](https://staud.clothing/products/calluna-dress-magenta-painted-floral-1)

### Mermaid Off-the-Shoulder Stretch Satin Dress

![Blue mermaid off the shoulder mother of the bride dresses from Azazie](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/a75f2289-d189-41c0-81be-c89bb9f9c98f~rs_768.h-cr_0.29.1140.1549)

_[Photo: Azazie](https://www.azazie.com/products/azazie-boone-dark-navy-mermaid-off-the-shoulder-stretch-satin-floor-length-mother-of-the-bride-dress/83127653)_

Satin is another delicate fabric that always looks elegant. This dress shows off your shoulders, has a pretty sweetheart neckline and attachable spaghetti straps if you need support. 

**Size range:** 0–30

[$179 | Azazie](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=88935&awinaffid=565019&campaign=&clickref=TK-mother-of-the-bride-dress-trends&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.azazie.com%2Fproducts%2Fazazie-boone-dark-navy-mermaid-off-the-shoulder-stretch-satin-floor-length-mother-of-the-bride-dress%2F83127653&platform=pl)

### Crepe Embellished Neck Sleeveless High-Low Gown

![Mac Duggal blue embellished high low mother of the bride dresses from Nordstrom](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/83258d40-084a-46ab-9136-3021c3d6f8e8~rs_768.h-cr_0.101.1400.1968)

_[Photo: Nordstrom](https://www.nordstrom.com/s/womens-crepe-embellished-neck-sleeveless-high-low-gown/8260483)_

Want to know the pros of choosing crepe fabric? It has a subtle, yet unique rippling look and it won't make you hot while you're sitting at your child's outdoor ceremony. Bonus: You'll be able to catch a pleasant breeze with this gown because it's sleeveless and has a high-low hem.

**Size range:** 2–14

[$498 | Nordstrom](https://nordstrom.sjv.io/c/64733/1960196/23920?subId1=TK-mother-of-the-bride-dress-trends&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fwomens-crepe-embellished-neck-sleeveless-high-low-gown%2F8260483)

[$498 | Bloomingdale's](https://www.bloomingdales.com/shop/product/mac-duggal-crepe-embellished-neck-high-low-gown?ID=5481846)

## 3\. Dazzling Metallics

"Metallics are another trend we're super happy to see for mothers of the bride and groom," Romeli says. "They're almost the 'new neutrals': Whether it be silver, shades of gold, rose gold, gunmetal or a combination of different metallics, you never have to worry about clashing with someone else's dress color or the room or decor." 

Dresses that incorporate metallics can easily elevate any look. "Metallics are a nice way to add some flare without too much drama," Carrabine adds. I've seen hundreds of wedding dresses and I can confirm that a glossy sheen can bring an otherwise casual silhouette into the black-tie world. The best part about metallic mother-of-the-bride dresses is that there are so many different styles to choose from. "Our favorite metallic looks are: unexpected combinations of metallics, geometric designs with a metallic sheen, metallic with florals and a subtle metallic underlay," Romeli says.

### Sequin Gown With Faux Belt

![Blomingdale's silver sequined mother-of-the-bride gown](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/aec16b80-d5e0-4348-9c3f-86d47fb8f677~rs_768.h-cr_22.0.678.875)

_[Photo: Bloomingdale's](https://www.bloomingdales.com/shop/product/aqua-belted-sequin-gown-exclusive?ID=2761764)_

A trellis pattern of silver sequins gives this short-sleeve stunner by AQUA an allover sparkle without weighing it down. Some of the sequins even create a belted-waist effect. Wondering what [mother-of-the-bride accessories](https://www.theknot.com/content/mother-of-the-bride-accessories) to wear with this dress? Pick simple studs so they don't take away from the outfit's shine.

**Size range:** 0–16

[$278 | Bloomingdale's](https://www.bloomingdales.com/shop/product/aqua-belted-sequin-gown-exclusive?ID=2761764)

### Brocade One-Shoulder Floral Gown With Bow

![Mac Duggal shimmery jacquard mother-of-the-bride dress](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/9cf8491f-db7d-4be7-b284-0f6652c1f1d4~rs_768.h-cr_44.0.816.1029)

_[Photo: Mac Duggal](https://macduggal.com/products/27546)_

Rockmore says she'll put her money on seeing "liquid metallics that catch the light without screaming disco ball" next year, and I agree. Shimmery threads in this weighty brocade give this dress a lovely luminesce without being obnoxious. A tiered ruffle at the bottom and bow detail are fun elements that lend to the dress's interesting structure and architecture. (**_Psst:_** While metallic MOB dresses in 2026 is the focus here, this frock also embodies another trend—namely, a one-shoulder bodice—making it a perfect, of-the-moment pick.)

**Size range:** 2–16

[$798 | Mac Duggal](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=9ibcrDa*U1o&mid=47862&u1=TK-mother-of-the-bride-dress-trends&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fmacduggal.com%2Fproducts%2F27546)

### Full-Sequin Strapless Dress

![Black sequin strapless mother of the bride dresses from STAUD](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/1bba8a70-c2a4-47b9-a431-1657ef751d04~rs_768.h-cr_0.89.960.1369)

_[Photo: STAUD](https://staud.clothing/products/cece-dress-espresso-black)_

Inspired by STAUD's best-selling [Casey dress](https://staud.clothing/products/casey-dress-bronze), the Cece dress is the form-fitting option for moms of a to-be-wed because of the cinched empire waist detail. Wondering where this sequin style will look best? Collins says: "For couples having a black-tie wedding, many moms are seeking an all-over sequin dress. This type of dress is elegant and makes a statement." I love the Cece dress in Espresso Black for 2026 fall or winter weddings or opt for Turmeric Black to satisfy a maximalist dress code. 

**Size range:** 00–16

[$595 | STAUD](https://staud.clothing/products/cece-dress-espresso-black)

### Foil Leaf Short-Sleeve Gown

![Foil leaf shirt gown mother of the bride dresses from Adrianna Papell](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/bcce96d8-2909-4c6d-8117-f473b3da3d26~rs_768.h-cr_304.0.1659.1806)

_[Photo: Adrianna Papell](https://www.adriannapapell.com/products/foil-leaf-short-sleeve-gown-with-draped-details-in-light-blue-gold-ap1e211045)_

The dress doesn't sparkle, but it shines brilliantly in the light because of the foil leaf fabric. (This makes it an ideal pick for those who want to participate in the metallic trend without feeling too overwhelmed.) Is this the dress you've been looking for? **Use our exclusive code: THEKNOT25 to get $25 off any purchase of $100.**

## 4\. Focused Embellishment

Even though metallics in all forms are becoming more popular, there are still those who prefer more toned down [wedding attire for the mother of the groom](https://www.theknot.com/content/mother-of-the-groom-attire) or mother of the bride. "Some moms are taking a less-is-more approach, but we're seeing pops of embellishment—like a detail on the neckline or a floral pattern on the side of the bodice—that look super chic and make a gown extra special," Kaplan says. New York-based bridal stylist and author Julie Sabatino of [The Stylish Bride](https://thestylishbride.com/) agrees: "There are mothers of the bride and groom that are embracing fresh ways to shine, shifting away from dresses that carry all the drama."

### Floor-Length Gown With Beaded Appliqué

![Green floor-length mother of the bride dresses from AW Bridal](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/3fd03105-51a9-4b6b-95de-691c02fcd137~rs_768.h-cr_0.32.1022.1395)

### Scallop Neckline Gown With Bold Floral Detail

![Teri Jon black mother of the bride dress with scallop neckline featuring bold floral detail from Neiman Marcus](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/b58fc52f-3c03-41e0-9bde-2627cf5b50ab~rs_768.h-cr_50.0.1550.2000)

Modern and timeless go hand in hand when it comes to this floor-length mother-of-the-bride or -groom dress. The puff sleeves and flattering silhouette make this piece gorgeous, but the true highlight is the eye-catching flower detail that starts at the neckline and cascades down to the hips. A customer review for the dress says it best: "The photo doesn't really capture the embroidered detail—it's very elegant!"

### Pleated Satin Dress With Beaded Neckline

Don't want to worry about finding the perfect jewelry to match your mother-of-the-bride dress in 2026? Then buy a dress that covers your neck in all the right ways. "I'll forever champion embellished necklines because they allow you to skip the necklace and still look utterly finished," Rockmore says. 

**Size range:** 0–30

### Bandeau Maxi Dress With Cascading Embellishment

![Pink embellished bandeau maxi mother of the bride dresses from Karen Millen](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/9c3813f2-77e3-4533-8562-14aedf128939~rs_768.h-cr_0.69.1000.1402)

_[Photo: Karen Millen](https://www.karenmillen.com/us/embellished-figure-form-bandeau-maxi-dress/BKK26551.html?color=535)_

Another focused-embellishment mother-of-the-bride dress I can't get enough of, this frock is decorated with diagonal floral detailing that's made of sequins, gems and beads, which creates a dynamic visual effect. Another aspect I love is the back slit, which allows the wearer to move freely despite the form-fitting silhouette. To quote Cher: "Can I hear a little commotion for the dress? Now let's hear it for the back of the dress!" 

**Size range:** XS–L

## 5\. Column Silhouettes 

I can't talk about trendy dresses for the mother-of-the-bride or groom without mentioning column frocks. Why? Because I was amazed at how I saw luxurious column-silhouette mother-of-the-bride dresses on just about every wedding fashion site I visited. Rockmore confirms the upcoming craze and guarantees sleek column silhouettes, specifically ones with architectural draping, will be everywhere in 2026. And since this style, which naturally lays on the hips and blends into a straight, structured look, screams sophisticated elegance, I understand why the dress shape is becoming more popular. (Remember, even though they're similar, column dress silhouettes are different from [sheath dress silhouettes](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-dress-silhouettes#sheath-2), which use lighter materials.) 

### Beaded Fringe Column Gown

![Black beaded fringe column mother of the bride dresses from Mac Duggal](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/004117db-b3a6-4866-811d-78de93c6843a~rs_768.h-cr_51.51.1542.2039)

_[Photo: Mac Duggal](https://macduggal.com/products/6190)_

There's a lot to love about this hand-embellished column gown—my favorite part is the "messy" hem. From the cap sleeves with beaded fringe to the scoop back, this black dress will stun in all the right ways. 

**Size range:** 2–14

### Strapless Bow Column Maxi Dress

_[Photo: Lulus](https://www.lulus.com/products/marvelous-vision-red-strapless-bow-column-maxi-dress/2751911.html)_

Need a winter mother-of-the-bride or groom dress for 2026? Consider this red, bow-adorned beauty. (Black is also available, but I think the white bow can potentially look too bridal.) I guarantee you'll get lots of compliments on this simple, yet striking dress. **Use our exclusive code: THEKNOT25 to get 25% off first-time purchases on selected categories.**

### Sequin Top With Column Dress Skirt

_[Photo: Sachin & Babi](https://www.sachinandbabi.com/products/marlene-gown-silver-glacial-blue)_

Here's another outfit that checks off two mother-of-the-bride dress trends. Not only is there a silver sequin (hello, metallic) dress top with flounce sleeves, but the skirt portion is a column shape accentuated with a chic, wide belt. 

**Size range:** 0–22W

### Hip-Contouring Column Dress

Just because you're the mom of a to-be-wed doesn't mean you can't wear a dress that makes you look good. This floor-length outfit hugs the hips and has a twisted-tie design that gathers at the side waist to promote a subtle, alluring look. **Use our exclusive code: AWKNOT10 to get 10% off.**

## 6\. One Shoulder 

"One-shoulder dresses will continue to be strong," Carrabine says. Kaplan adds: "The draped one-shoulder is an update to the classic one-shoulder that has been so pervasive in recent years. That strap is evolving into more of a sculptural, asymmetrical neckline with an off-the-shoulder sleeve." The move reflects a [wedding dress trend](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-dress-trends) toward structured, architectural fashion and looks chic and sophisticated compared to a more casual sleeveless one-shoulder bodice. Besides varying one-shoulder styles, you should also consider the overall shape. Collins says: "The trend is on many different silhouettes, like A-line and fitted dresses." That said, opt for the silhouette that flatters you best and remain on trend.

### One-Shoulder, Satin Maxi Dress

![Purple one shoulder satin maxi mother of the bride dresses from Anthropologie](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/6b01f870-b686-42b3-83f8-6824828d272f~rs_768.h-cr_0.212.1450.2145)

**Size range:** XXS–XXL (some colors have more limited size ranges)

### Asymmetrical Off-Shoulder Cuff Gown

In this design from the master of [mother-of attire](https://www.theknot.com/content/mother-of-the-bride-attire), Teri Jon, a structured cuff serves as a built-in bolero. It provides coverage while giving sophistication to the nth degree. The gown's stretch mikado is a fabulous fabric that'll hold its shape all evening long.

### One-Shoulder Midi Dress With Front Slit

![Green one shoulder midi mother of the bride dresses from Tuckernuck](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/2829e02c-71b3-4c9a-8274-fcdb9f48991b~rs_768.h-cr_6.148.795.1200)

_[Photo: Tuckernuck](https://tnuck.com/products/emerald-one-shoulder-ainslee-midi-dress)_

Emerald is the perfect 2026 winter mother-of-the-bride dress color, which is why you need to hurry up and snatch this 'fit. This midi has the one-shoulder you need to stay on trend, but also comes with a bow detail, front slit and side cinching for an even more fashionable look. 

**Size range:** XS–L

### One-Shoulder Sash Dress

Collins says one-shoulder dresses are stylish and a great choice for mothers, and I have to agree. Check out this ensemble, which has a long, flowing, sheer sash that adds drama to the dress.

**Size range:** 2–16

## 7\. Cape Details 

For those looking for trendy, modern mother-of-the-bride dresses, I have good news for you: Capes haven't fallen out of favor, and fashion experts agree. "The love affair with cape details isn't going anywhere—they're dramatic without being fussy," Rockmore says. Whether you hope to feel like royalty or simply want more coverage on your arms, a dress with a cape or cape details is the way to go. But before you buy the first cape dress you see, consider the environment the celebration will be in. Will it be hot, on the beach or during the rainy season? You'll have to think about all of these things and more to ensure your cape fits your surroundings and you're not uncomfortable. 

### Embellished Beaded Cape Gown

![Gold embellished beaded cape mother of the bride dresses from Mac Duggal](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/9da72392-cefe-4772-97bf-cbc756df322c~rs_768.h-cr_67.26.1561.2018)

_[Photo: Mac Duggal](https://macduggal.com/products/93869)_

I must say, this is one of the best mother-of-the-bride dresses for 2026 on the list. If your child's number-one request is for you to go all-out, then you need to buy this dress. Embellished with sequins and gems, this gown and the cape's sweeping train will definitely complete the assignment. 

**Size range:** 2–22

### Sheer Cape Dress With Flower Detail

### Baroque-Style Embroidered Cape-Sleeve Dress

_[Photo: Karen Millen](https://www.karenmillen.com/us/baroque-embroidered-cape-sleeve-twill-woven-maxi-dress/BKK26115.html)_

The baroque-inspired print is eye-catching, but you can't miss the feather-like details added to the cape sleeves that make them look like a bird's wings. (I was super excited to include this dress in the roundup because it's unique and can work for a casual or artsy affair.)

**Size range:** 2–12

Last but not least: the Vittoria gown, with its regal cape, will look gorgeous as you walk your child down the aisle. Many customer reviews say they love the dress and its stunning embroidery, but that buyers should keep in mind that the fabric is on the heavier side.
