### Best Overall Carry-On Luggage: Travelpro Maxlite 5 21" Expandable Carry-On Spinner

![Black soft-sided carry-on luggage for newlyweds](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/c2f55e50-8cbd-441c-abb9-55f2a4e365af~rs_768.h-cr_454.0.1579.1500)

When it comes to the best carry-on luggage for a wedding registry, look no further than this pick from Travelpro. Hard-shell luggage might be more durable, but soft-sided carry-ons have advantages too. Travelpro has some of the best luggage to register for if you're looking for something simple and fuss free. The Maxlite 5 is a great example with a streamlined design. 

  * **Best features:** This thoughtfully designed luggage is one of Travelpro's lightest offerings coming in at an impressive 5.4 pounds. That means it 1) shouldn't take you over the weight limit and 2) is easy to carry. There are also lots of pockets for maximizing organization, including two handy front pockets, a full-length lid pocket on the inside and a side accessory pocket. The 360-degree wheels promote a smooth ride and the lightweight handle locks into two positions to suit your height. All in all, this soft-sided carry-on is a lightweight and budget-friendly option for your registry.
  * **Size:** Exterior (includes wheels and carry handles): 23" x 14.5" x 9, Interior: 21" x 14" x 9", Weight: 5.4 lbs., Volume: 46 
  * **Material:** Polyester fabric with DuraGuard® coating; ECOFAB™lining is made from 100% post-consumer recycled plastic bottles, then treated with H2O guard for moisture resistance
  * **Potential downsides:** Travelpro's Maxlite has an overall measurement of 23-inches by 14.5-inches by 9-inches when expanded, which is slightly larger than most airlines' requirements. However, when it's not fully expanded, the case should fit in the overhead bins of most major US airlines.
  * **Editor review:** "I've owned my Travelpro carry-on for years and it's still the first suitcase I reach for in my closet (I'm embarrassed to admit that I own quite a few!). I love it so much that I've also influenced many of my family members to buy their own Travelpro soft-sided carry-ons. It truly can fit so much and I've packed for week-long trips with just this expandable carry-on before. Honestly, it's a no-brainer with the price and versatility. I also really like that the handle has two height settings—I find that incredibly useful on escalators at the airport." –[Hannah Nowack](https://www.theknot.com/content/author/hannah-nowack), Senior Manager of Editorial Brand Content

### Best Overall Checked Luggage: Away The Large

![Away The Large, best checked luggage](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/485eeee2-006e-447b-9e2b-2994781b4a08~rs_768.h-cr_496.0.1996.2000)

Wondering about what's popular with current [wedding registry trends](https://www.theknot.com/content/new-wedding-registry-trends)? Away is the trendy luggage brand you've likely been seeing all over your Insta feed. The site's modern and practical suitcases are an instant hit with buyers. Choose from six solid colorways in Away's aptly named "The Large" and have your luggage personalized for an extra-special (and easy-to-recognize) touch. As a reminder, you can add Away travel gear (as well as any other brand) to your wedding registry on The Knot using our clever browser button feature.

  * **Best features:** What makes this suitcase the best luggage for registry wishlists? Away's biggest checked bag comes in at the typical maximum measurement of 62 linear inches. That means you'll get the most space possible while staying within the guidelines for most airlines. The outside is durable polycarbonate with luxe leather details (including a luggage tag). There's also a standard TSA-approved combination lock and gliding 360-degree wheels. Inside, you'll find two roomy compartments with an interior compression system for efficient packing. Bonus: A hidden laundry bag allows you to keep dirty clothes separate.
  * **Size:** Exterior: 29" x 20.5" x 12.5", Interior: 26.9" x 19.7" x 10.6", Weight: 12.1 lbs, Capacity: 99.2 L
  * **Material:** 100% polycarbonate shell; includes water-resistant luggage tab (crafted from 50% recycled leather) and a water-resistant polyester laundry bag 
  * **Potential downsides:** The Large has a whopping capacity of 99.2 liters, but keep in mind that many airlines have a maximum weight limit of around 50 pounds. Since the luggage itself weighs 11.6 pounds, that leaves you with a 38.4-pound allowance.
  * **Editor review:** "This is the first piece of luggage I truly invested in, and my only regret is not buying it sooner! It's so sleek and compact, yet I'm always blown away by how much I'm able to fit inside of it. The interior compression system is great for an overpacker like me, and I love that it comes with a laundry bag to keep dirty clothes separate. I can't wait to add more matching pieces to my Away collection!" –[Kate Boswell](https://www.theknot.com/content/author/kate-boswell), Fashion Editor

### Most Durable Carry-On Luggage: Monos Carry-On Pro

![Monos light blue carry-on luggage with front pocket for wedding registry](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/9b93be64-842e-4829-89df-5dd8dae44703~rs_768.h-cr_0.1.1499.2000)

_Photo: Monos_

You might've heard of Monos already—it's a pretty popular brand when it comes to travel gear, and for good reason. Pretty much every aspect of the site's Carry-On Pro suitcase demonstrates sleek functionality. Plus, it looks great too. The minimalist polycarbonate outer shell comes in eight core colorways, from neutral tones to pretty pink, blue and green hues.

  * **Best features:** So, what exactly makes Monos the best luggage for newlyweds? Let's start with the outside. A durable, water-resistant polycarbonate shell, unbelievably quiet 360-degree wheels, and TSA-approved combination lock set this suitcase up for success. There's also a genius front pocket (also protected by polycarbonate and a lockable zipper) that makes flight must-haves (like your passport and laptop) easy to access. Inside, there's an anti-microbial lining and the luggage also comes with two shoe bags, an anti-microbial laundry bag and a luggage tag. How's that as a wedding gift for a travel-loving pair?
  * **Size:** Exterior: 22" × 14" × 9", Interior: 20" × 13.5", Pocket: 15.3" × 10" × 1", Weight: 7.8 lb, Capacity: 29 L
  * **Material:** Aerospace-grade, water-resistant polycarbonate hard shell made from partially recycled materials
  * **Potential downsides:** While the Monos Carry-On Pro measures up to the exact maximum size specs given by most airlines (22 inches by 14 inches by 9 inches), some reviewers found it to be on the smaller side. If you're not the biggest fan of traveling light, the [Carry-On Pro Plus](https://monos.com/products/carry-on-pro-plus) is extra roomy. Just make sure it's not too big for your airline's overhead bins.
  * **Standout review:** "This is a fantastic carry-on suitcase! Extremely pleased with my purchase. I travel 200,000 air miles per year. I need a carry-on that is lightweight, durable and flexible. Also, I will be traveling extensively in Europe and thus need a carry-on that is compliant with the more strict international carry-on size limits." –Douglas V., [Monos](https://monos.com/collections/luggage/products/carry-on-pro)

**Honorable mention:**[Bric's Positano 21" Spinner](https://www.theknot.com/registry/store/products/positano-21-spinner-1)

### Most Durable Checked Luggage: Briggs & Riley Torq 2.0 30" 4-Wheel Checked Suitcase

![Briggs & Riley Torq 2.0 30](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/9528a09f-2c55-4ed6-864c-f7241ea507d3~rs_768.h-cr_247.0.1732.1980)

_Photo: The Knot_

Although Briggs & Riley luggage tends to be on the pricier side, it is renowned for its strength and durability. If you want to invest in durable luggage that'll last you years to come, consider this selection for your wedding registry. 

  * **Best features:** Instead of having the zipper go down the middle of the bag, it is designed to be positioned 70% of the way up the bag. This 70/30 split is intended to help users "efficiently pack and access bulkier items," according to the brand. 
  * **Size:** Exterior (includes wheels and handle): 30.5" x 20" x 12.5", Interior: 28.5" x 20" x 12.5", Capacity: 112.7 L, Weight: 10.5 lbs. 
  * **Material:** Makrolon® polycarbonate hardside shell
  * **Potential downsides:** The durability of this luggage comes at the expense of weight. At nearly 11lbs. it is heavier than other checked luggage options available. 
  * **Standout review:** "This is the perfect size for a long trip or 2 people in 1 bag. It is do light it gives plenty of room. We used to deal with 2 checked bags and now only need this L- spinner. Super easy roll. . . great wheels and it has shown to be super durable!" –Charles K, [Briggs & Riley](https://www.briggs-riley.com/products/torq-large-spinner-qu230sp)

### Best Lightweight Carry-On Luggage: Bric's Ulisse 21" 4-Wheel Expandable Carry-On Suitcase

![Bric's bright yellow carry-on luggage for newlyweds](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/d01fdd85-7ac2-46da-ba1e-ea1dafa38042~rs_768.h-cr_438.0.1563.1500)

_Photo: The Knot_

Inject some color into your travel ensemble with a bright yellow carry-on by Bric's. This cheery luggage is perfect for sunny getaways (but if you prefer to keep things classic, there are also black, navy and light pink colors.) The striking colorways aren't the only eye-catching thing about this carry-on. The stylish urban aesthetic comes through beautifully in the suitcases's unique grooves.

  * **Best features:** Bric's Ulisse carry-on has pretty much all the features you'd expect from a good piece of luggage: a durable polypropylene shell, an ergonomic, adjustable handle, 360-degree wheels and a TSA-approved lock. But that's not all. This awesome carry-on also boasts a USB port so you can carry your own battery for charging your phone or tablet. Inside, a printed lining adds an extra dose of luxury.
  * **Size:** 19" x 28" x 11", Volume: 90L, Weight: 8.8 lbs
  * **Material:** Polypropylene
  * **Potential downsides:** The polypropylene shell makes this suitcase more affordable than polycarbonate and aluminum options, but it is slightly less durable. The carry-on's interior doesn't have a lot of extras for organization, featuring two main compartments and one small pocket for accessories. If you're someone who likes everything to have its own place, you might prefer a carry-on with additional pockets and compartments.
  * **Standout review:** "I own Brics luggage and the 21" carry on were a great addition for quick trips. The quality of Brics can't be beat. These are lightweight and handle great." –StephanieAB, [Luggage Online](https://www.luggageonline.com/products/brics-b-y-ulisse-21-expandable-spinner)

### Best Lightweight Checked Luggage: Monos Check-In Medium

![Monos medium checked luggage for newlyweds](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/64e5b88e-4193-44b3-9dce-f95b07c3348e~rs_768.h-cr_438.0.1563.1500)

_Photo: Monos_

We're just as impressed with Monos' check-in luggage as we are with its carry-ons. The brand's reliable gear is exactly what you need for your future travels, especially if you plan to explore far and wide. The checked bags are available in the same eight core colorways as the carry-ons, so you can snag a matching set if you're in the market for both.

  * **Best features:** We love Monos' medium check-in for its versatility. Measuring just 55.5 linear inches, you should be well within the maximum range when it comes to sizing requirements. The convenient size is also less bulky to take through the airport or throw in the trunk of a cab. But don't let this compact size fool you—there's still a capacity of 70 liters inside. The outer shell is made from aerospace-grade polycarbonate that's sturdy and reliable. Plus, a TSA-approved combination lock adds extra security. The 360-degree wheels are designed to be ultra quiet and the handle has four different height settings. Inside, take advantage of compression straps, a divider and soft antimicrobial fabric.
  * **Size:** Exterior: 26.5" × 18.5" × 10.5", Interior: 24.4" × 17.7", Weight: 9.59 lb, Capacity: 60 L
  * **Material:** Aerospace-grade, water-resistant polycarbonate hard shell made from partially recycled materials; Anti-microbial lining, made from 100% recycled polyester
  * **Potential downsides:** Some reviewers have flagged that shipping is on the slower side, so if you've got your heart set on this suitcase, it's best to order well in advance of your next trip.
  * **Standout review:** "This was a wedding gift for my daughter's honeymoon. She loves it and thinks the color is pretty." –Shah H., [Monos](https://monos.com/products/check-in-medium?variant=30728351776842)

![Samsonite Freeform luggage](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/d13e52e6-b3a1-4976-91d1-2e1821d20c2e~rs_768.h-cr_165.0.1065.1200)

_Photo: The Knot_

Looking for luggage sets that are lightweight and durable? Luggage sets are fun because you can register for two colorways so you and your partner can have matching luggage sets. This Samsonite duo is one of the best luggage sets for wedding registry wishlists. 

  * **Best features:** Samsonite's 10-year warranty on this luggage set makes it a worthwhile purchase. This luggage is also very lightweight.
  * **Size:** Carry-On luggage: 23" x 15" x 10" (interior) and 20.5"x14.5"x10" (exterior), Checked luggage: 31.1" x 20.9" x 13.8" (interior) and 27.6"x20"x13" (exterior), Weight: 16.1 total (6.5 lbs for carry-on, 9.6 lbs for checked) 
  * **Material:** Polypropylene
  * **Potential downsides:** The polypropylene construction of this luggage makes it lightweight and affordable, but it is also more prone to damage than polycarbonate. 
  * **Editor review:** "I really like Samsonite. Their luggage is durable and takes very minimal damage—mine has fallen down a flight of stairs and an airport baggage handler accidentally dropped it. My favorite features about the brand's luggage is that it's budget friendly (but not low quality), has a TSA-approved lock, smooth wheels and plenty of room for the six pairs of shoes I feel like I need to bring for a two-day trip." –[Chapelle Johnson](https://www.theknot.com/content/author/chapelle-johnson), Associate Editor

_Photo: The Knot_

Under $150 for a carry-on? Yep. Not only is this American Tourister selection affordable, but it's also cute to boot. 

  * **Best features:** Multi-directional spinner wheels for easy maneuverability; Features 3 interior pockets for organization; Adjustable push-button locking handle for ease of use
  * **Size:** 20.25" x 14" x 8", Weight: 8 lbs. 
  * **Material:** Polycarbonate
  * **Potential downsides:** This is a no-frills piece of luggage—it doesn't have many of the add-ons, like batteries or TSA-approved locks, that some folks look for when evaluating what is the best carry-on luggage to buy. 
  * **Standout review:** "Super light, super-maneuverable wheels, beautiful ombre lavender-purple. Most important, it meets airlines carry-on size requirements." –Jan, [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/American-Tourister-20-inch-Spinner-Slate/dp/B0BN4CK363?tag=tkcommerce-218-20&th=1)

_Photo: The Knot_

As far as check-in baggage goes, the best luggage for newlyweds is sturdy, secure and spacious. Since you'll be parting with this bag (and everything inside) once you get to the airport, durability is more important than ever. Enter: Samsonite's hard-shell Freeform suitcase. It comes in four chic colorways, including black, white, navy and green.

  * **Best features:** The Freeform 29.5-inch check-in suitcase has a durable yet budget-friendly polypropylene shell. Like we said before, it strikes a perfect balance between longevity and lightness. A TSA-approved combination lock secures the inside, which boasts two spacious compartments with handy interior dividers. Internal cross straps help keep clothing in place during travel, so when you arrive you'll be opening the same neatly packed suitcase.
  * **Size:** 28" x 20" x 13" (without wheels), Weight: 9.59 lbs. 
  * **Material:** Polypropylene
  * **Potential downsides:** Again, polypropylene isn't the _most_ hard-wearing of all the hard-shell suitcase materials. If you're particularly worried about damage to the contents of your suitcase or plan on packing fragile valuables or souvenirs, opt for luggage with an aluminum shell (or at the very least, polycarbonate).
  * **Standout review:** "I recently took the Samsonite Freeform 21-Inch Hardside Carry-On on a week-long trip, and I couldn't be more impressed! From the moment I packed it to the moment I rolled it through the airport, this suitcase exceeded all expectations." –Celeste R., [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Samsonite-Freeform-Hardside-Expandable-Spinner/dp/B01LY047AR?tag=tkcommerce-218-20&th=1)

  * **Material:** Polycarbonate hard-shell luggage 
  * **Potential downsides:** While the luggage has features to accommodate device charging, the set does not come with batteries and those must be purchased separately.

This expandable lightweight spinner is an absolute game-changer for frequent travelers like myself.

If you and your partner are adventurous (and your ideal getaway involves camping!) then a duffel bag may be the way to go when it comes to settling on the best value luggage for your lifestyle. "Thule Chasm is a rough-and-ready duffel bag that can be thrown into your trunk or roof box, perfect for short trips or multi-day adventures," says the brand. 

  * **Best features:** This duffel can be carried with a single shoulder strap but it can also be converted into a backpack for easier carrying. The wide mouth of the bag also makes it easy to pack and access. 
  * **Size:** 34" x 18" x 16.5", Weight: 5.73 lb
  * **Material:** 100% recycled 900D polyester, Phthalate-free laminate
  * **Potential downsides:** Items are generally more prone to damage inside a duffel bag when compared to a traditional suitcase. 
  * **Standout review:** "This bag is fabulous. It fits so much, so well, has the perfect amount of compartments and zippered pouches. The style and structure (shape), quality of the bag is amazing. It's also super easy and comfortable to carry on the back even when packed completely full." –Kater, [Thule](https://www.thule.com/en-us/luggage/travel-duffel-bags/thule-chasm-130l-duffel-_-3205001)

_Photo: The Knot_

If you like the space-saving nature of a duffel, but don't want to have to deal with carrying a duffel then a wheeled option may be the way to go. 

  * **Best features:** This duffel bag has multiple compartments for organized storage and two wheels for easy transportation. Additionally, it is made of recycled materials which is appealing to many folks who want eco-conscious products. 
  * **Size:** 16.5'' x 9.63'' x 28.75'', Weight: 10 lbs., Capacity: 94 L 
  * **Material:** Main shell: 300D recycled polyester tarpaulin with TPU laminate, Back: 840D recycled ballistic nylon with non-PFC durable water-repellent (non-PFC DWR) finish 
  * **Potential downsides:** Since this is a hybrid between a duffel and a suitcase it has some benefits of both. However, since it isn't fully a duffel it doesn't have the same level of versatility as other duffel bags. Similarly, since it isn't fully a suitcase, it doesn't have the same protective structure and convenience of a suitcase. 
  * **Standout review:** "I have 5 base camp duffels of all sizes and have been traveling with them for years but finally I decided I was tired of carrying them through the airports got this and was sooo happy!!" –Aaron B., [The North Face](https://www.thenorthface.com/en-us/p/bags-and-gear/luggage-and-duffels/rolling-luggage-224545/base-camp-voyager-29-roller-NF0A52UE)

### Best Luxury Carry-On: TUMI 19 Degree 22" 4-Wheel Continental Carry-On Suitcase

![TUMI carry-on suitcase](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/3e5471c6-7bc8-4c71-9de3-9817c0482928~rs_768.h-cr_164.0.1139.1300)

TUMI is a higher-end luggage brand, ideal for couples who like to pay a little extra in return for quality and reliability. You can add this bad boy to your wedding registry directly through The Knot Registry Store (or purchase it right away if you can't wait that long!). The classic black exterior has a sharp, textured finish that looks good up close and far away.

  * **Best features:** The outer shell of this sturdy suitcase is hands-down its best feature. It's made from aluminum, which is even more durable than polycarbonate. The adjustable handle is made from aircraft-grade aluminum, which is lightweight and sturdy. There's also a unique patented system in place to further protect the handle from damage and patent-pending DuraFold construction at the corners for even more resistance. Ultimately, this luggage is designed to last.
  * **Size:** 22" H x 16.5" W x 9" D (Dimensions include wheels), Weight: 7.12 lbs
  * **Material:** Aluminum
  * **Potential downsides:** Aluminum might be extra reliable when it comes to keeping your things safe, but it's also what makes this carry-on pricier than some of its competitors. Additionally, while aluminum is lightweight as far as metals go, it's heavier than polycarbonate. This suitcase weighs in at a total of 7 pounds, which could get in the way if your airline has a weight restriction for carry-ons.
  * **Standout review:** "Love this suitcase! It has ample room and is sturdy and rolls so well. Perfect weekend bag!" –Paul M, [TUMI](https://www.tumi.com/p/continental-expandable-4-wheeled-carry-on-01396841041/)

### Best Luxury Checked Luggage: RIMOWA Original Check-In M

![Rimowa medium checked luggage in titanium hue wedding registry idea](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/a3b6cded-495d-443b-8726-6e8a2ace984d~rs_768.h-cr_375.0.1200.1100)

RIMOWA makes aluminum hard-shell luggage, like this titanium-tone suitcase (which also comes in quartz pink, black and silver by the way). You can rest assured your belongings are extra safe in the confines of aluminum. But that's not the only thing we love about it. The iconic grooved design is undeniably sleek.

  * **Best features:** This medium suitcase measures just over 53 linear inches, so it should be well within the maximum size limit for most, if not all, airlines. It also has plenty of space inside divided into two compartments that are each fitted with an adjustable divider. On the outside, TSA-approved locks add an extra layer of security and top-of-the-range wheels make steering effortless. The handle has stage-free adjustment, meaning you can set it at the perfect height for you. What more could you ask for from a check-in bag?
  * **Size:** 26.4" x 17.8" x 9.5", Weight: 11.9 lbs, Volume: 58.2 L 
  * **Material:** Outside: Aluminium, Inside: Polyester, Handles: Plastic, Wheels: Hard Plastic, Dividers: Polyester
  * **Potential downsides:** Luxury luggage comes with a luxury price tag. This long-lasting aluminum suitcase will go the extra mile, but it doesn't come cheap. Depending on your lifestyle and your [wedding guests' typical budgets](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-guest-cost), it may be a little too expensive for adding to your wedding registry (but that's where cash funds and group gifting come in!). 
  * **Standout review:** "Best luggage!! I've owned a couple of luggage pieces in the original and still going. They're handsome and extremely easy to maneuver." –Ann, Google

Looking to support a small business when building your wedding registry? Enter: Walker Family Goods. This Utah-based luggage and bag company is worth checking out as you're building your wedding registry. 

  * **Best features:** This bag, which is available in a whopping 16 different colors, has three compartments to help with organization and ease when packing. 
  * **Size:** 14" x 22" x 9", Capacity: 45 L
  * **Material:** 1000D Cordura and PC plastic, interior lined w/ Ripstop
  * **Potential downsides:** Shopping from a small business isn't the same as click "buy" on Amazon—while you're supporting the business more directly, you may have more limited options that you'd find at a larger retailer. 
  * **Editor review:** "I own multiple products from Walker Family Goods and love both the quality as well as the company's ethos. The family-owned business aims to instill a love of adventure and travel in the lives of the folks who purchase their products. I find it hard not to purchase one of everything in every color!" –Hannah Nowack, Senior Manager of Editorial Brand Content

Did you know that cult-favorite [Béis offers monogramming](https://beistravel.com/collections/personalized-monogramming)? Yep! If you like the idea of "his and hers" luggage, then go all in and get monograms.

  * **Best features:** The Large Check-In Roller is BÉIS' biggest checked luggage, measuring 61.25 linear inches. It has an impressive capacity of 112 liters distributed between two compartments and two separate pouches. Use one for small accessories and the other for storing laundry before you get home. There's also a compression flap and straps to help you make the most of the space. On the outside, the case has a durable polycarbonate shell, TSA-approved locks, 360-degree wheels and an extendable handle.
  * **Size:** Exterior (including wheel and handle): 31.3" x 19.6" x 12.6", Interior: 29" x 16.5" x 11", Weight: 11.84 lbs, Capacity: 112 L
  * **Material:** Polycarbonate, PVC, Polyester, Nylon Zipper, Hardware Metal
  * **Potential downsides:** A bigger suitcase means you get more space for your belongings, but it also weighs more, so you can only take advantage of more space as long as it's still under your airline's weight limit. This suitcase weighs 11.84 pounds, leaving you with a little over 38 pounds to work with. But there's a pro here too: The case has a weight limit indicator that lets you know if you're toeing the line.
  * **Editor review:** "At some point, I'm sure we've all heard the buzz around Beis. After dipping my toes in with [The Weekender](https://beistravel.com/products/the-weekender-in-maple) bag, I fell in love with the features Beis luggage offered. As a self-proclaimed over packer, the weight indicator has saved me money at the checked baggage counter while also helping prep ahead for souvenirs, making it free according to girl math, right? Notably, the organization (pockets on pockets), expandable nature and smooth 360 wheels are standout features. Last but certainly not least, I cannot forget to mention the stunning color ways, which make for the perfect matching couple moment." –Taylor Whitten, Content Strategy Manager

Chances are you've seen folks online heaping praises on Dagne Dover. The brand is experiencing a bit of an online craze and for good reason. The bags are incredibly practical and great for staying organized. Plus, nearlyweds can utilize the site's "Build a Kit" functionality to save 25% by mixing and matching with other products from the brand. 

  * **Best features:** The bag's neoprene fabric (the same material wetsuits are made of) is durable and water resistant. 
  * **Size:** Size: 16.5" x 9" x 11", Volume: 29 L, Weight: 3 lbs, Handle drop: 10", Crossbody strap length: 16"–28"
  * **Material:** Exterior: Premium neoprene, Interior: 100% REPREVE® recycled poly, Hardware: Color-plated zinc alloy
  * **Potential downsides:** The bag contains multiple compartments so you need to pay attention to where you put your belongings or you run the risk of forgetting where items are. 
  * **Editor review: "** While Dagne Dover bags are a bit of an investment, they're worth every penny. I have the Landon in Deep Olive Green and am absolutely obsessed with it. It has plenty of compartments and even comes with convenient additional bags for organization." –Hannah Nowack, Senior Manager of Editorial Brand Content

CALPAK is a frequent traveler's dream brand—in addition to solid suitcases, they also carry plenty of wonderful travel accessories, like packing cubes to keep the inside of your luggage organized. 

  * **Best features:** This set of packing cubes has containers in a variety of sizes to fit your needs. Additionally, there is a water-resistant pouch that's perfect for damp bathing suits. 
  * **Size:** 3 sizes: 13" x 10" x 1.5", 12" x 8.8" x 3", 15" x 11" x 3"
  * **Material:** Durable mesh fabric, envelope pouch is water-resistant
  * **Potential downsides:** The mesh fabric of the cubes make experience wear over time. 
  * **Editor review:** "Can I let you in on a secret? I own so many packing cubes it's actually a bit ridiculous. I simply love the convenience of separating out items when packing. With this in mind, I feel well-equipped to weigh in on packing cubes. I am a long-time shopper of Calpak and in addition to packing cubes, I also own a [toiletry bag from Calpak](https://www.calpaktravel.com/products/terra-hanging-toiletry-bag/blossom). I simply love having my suitcase contents all coordinate." –Hannah Nowack, Senior Manager of Editorial Brand Content

Like to travel light? If quick, overnight trips are more your speed, choose a carry-on that reflects those needs. You don't have to choose a bag that measures up to the maximum size restrictions if it won't serve you. Having extra space is great, but so is having a lightweight, easy-to-transport suitcase. Trust us, this mini carry-on will be a welcome (and adorable) new addition to your collection. (_Psst_ , CALPAK also has some of the best [luggage sets](https://www.calpaktravel.com/collections/luggage-sets) for your wedding registry if you want to invest in matching suitcases.)

  * **Best features:** This compact case has a hard-wearing polycarbonate shell, 360-degree wheels, a smooth extending handle and a TSA-approved lock. It's basically got all the features you'd find in a regular carry-on, but downsized. The interior is designed to help you make the most of the space, including compression straps and an interior divider with pockets.
  * **Size:** 16" x 14" x 8.5", Weight: 6.4 lbs 
  * **Material:** Polycarbonate
  * **Potential downsides:** If space is something you're usually lacking when you travel (or you plan on bringing back souvenirs), the Hue Mini Carry-On may not be your best choice. That said, it may fit the dimensions of some airline's personal bag specifications, meaning you could take it on board in addition to your regular carry-on. Check with your airline to find out if a 16-inch by 14-inch by 8-inch bag will fit under the seat.
  * **Standout review:** "Perfect size! I recently traveled internationally with the mini as my carry-on. With a small backpack and a carry-on size checked bag, I had enough for weeks and two climates, and room to spare for purchases. I fit all essentials in it for the rainforest portion of the trip, and had the mountain cold items in the checked bag, along with other stuff. The mini is so perfect! I can't say enough about it. It is so nimble. " –Arlene F., [Calpak](https://www.calpaktravel.com/products/hue-mini-carry-on-luggage/emerald)

## Why Are Suitcases So Expensive?

The quality and features of suitcases affect the price. Mylene Hebert, the product development director at [Lambert](https://lambertbags.com/) encourages to-be-weds to pay attention to what's included with their luggage when shopping. "Some brands offer great deals by including extra packing cubes, shoe bags, or a luggage tag. Sometimes, you can get a lot more for the same price with these super useful add-ons." 

### Hard vs. Soft Luggage 

The material of a suitcase (whether it is hard shell or soft shell) affects the price as well. According to Hebert, "Hard shells are known to be durable, easy to maintain, and they protect your personal items from water and impact. But it's important to choose one made of the right material as some hard shells can crack and break during travel. They're also heavier, which isn't ideal considering the weight limits for checked baggage. Soft luggage can expand a bit more and won't ever crack. But because they're soft, some of your personal items could get damaged. They also get dirty more easily and the material can wear out over time." FUrthermore, not all hard-shell luggage is the same. There are a few different types of hard-shell luggage available, but the most popular are made from polycarbonate, ABS or polypropylene. Polycarbonate is the most durable (but it's not quite as lightweight), ABS is a great budget-friendly option, and polypropylene offers a nice balance of durability and lightness. So which is better? Fish says that "ultimately, it comes down to your personal style and travel preferences." 

## How to Choose Luggage for Your Wedding Registry

Packing for a long trip can be a pain, even if it's for something as fun as your postwedding getaway. From trying to stay organized to attempting to fit all those souvenirs into your carry-on, it can definitely add stress to your trip. Mitigate any travel anxiety ahead of time by making sure you've got the right type and size of luggage. Figuring out the best option for you is actually pretty simple—you just need to know what to consider.

**Luggage considerations:**Travel Needs | Storage | Durability | Value | Size Restrictions

### Travel Needs 

What kind of travel do you normally engage in? This should guide your search. "Do they travel a lot and for long periods, or more occasionally? This will determine whether you need larger or smaller-sized luggages," says Hebert. Fish adds: "When adding luggage to your registry, I always encourage couples to think about how they truly travel. Not just the honeymoon, but all the adventures ahead. Consider your usual destinations, how long you typically travel for and whether you pack light or like options. You'll want luggage that's durable, easy to maneuver and versatile enough to grow with you as a couple! From weekend road trips to dream vacations down the line." 

Depending on where you usually jet off to, you might want to think about adding special suitcases to your wedding registry. For example, if you love exploring different wine regions, [wine luggage](https://flywithwine.com/) is a must for bringing back souvenirs. This specialty type of suitcase is designed to hold bottles in place and protect them from shock.

If you prefer hiking or camping vacations, regular luggage may not be your best bet either. Instead, opt for a large adventure-ready backpack or duffel that's easy to carry and won't weigh you down. Wheels will come in handy at the airport, but they're not so useful on grassy, muddy or rocky terrain. 

### Storage 

In the grand scheme of things, your luggage will be stored more than it will be used. Where are you going to store it? Hebert notes that you need space in your house to store luggage. "This is something to think about if you don't have a lot of space. There are some options that are collapsible, or you have sets that fit into one another." 

### Durability 

Luggage is an investment so you want it to last. For Hebert, she says that her go-to is a 100% polycarbonate shell for durability. Meanwhile, Fish notes that investing in quality wheels and a sturdy handle is important as well. 

### Value 

While you might be eyeing one very expensive suitcase, it's important to consider the breadth of the collection you want to build. Most folks invest in multiple pieces of luggage so you'll want to weigh value (the balance of cost, quality, and style) when registering. "A well-rounded luggage capsule usually includes at least a carry-on, a medium checked bag, and a large checked bag—that way, you're covered for quick getaways and extended trips," says Fish. Hebert adds that registering for luggage sets is a great way to save money.

### Size Restrictions

Before you start shopping, it's important to be aware of size restrictions. Each airline has its own carry-on requirements, though luckily, the majority of these are actually the same. In most cases, your carry-on should not exceed 22 inches long, 14 inches wide and 9 inches high. You should include the wheels and handle when taking your measurements, and always double-check the guidelines for the airline you're flying with before you go to the airport.

Luckily, the rules are a lot easier to follow when it comes to check-in luggage. The most common size restriction is that your bag should not exceed 62 linear inches. The length, width and height of your suitcase added together will tell you how many linear inches it is. There's also a maximum weight limit. This varies depending on the airline, but in many cases it's 50 pounds. Again, you should always double-check your airline's guidelines before you fly as size and weight restrictions can change.
