### About this venue

Rotunda Building is a wedding venue and cutting-edge conference center in the heart of Oakland, CA. Embodying Oakland's iconic history, this lavish and lovingly remodeled locale invites you and your loved ones to embrace the city's past, present, and wonders yet to come. With infinite opportunities in store, you and your soon-to-be spouse will have the time of your lives as you make each and every one of its spaces your own. Rotunda Building boasts many beautifully designed facilities that accommodate up to 1,500 guests. The Rotunda, the most exquisite of its ballrooms, was first constructed in 1912 and has remained true to its original charm with its Romanesque archways, accent walls, patterned tiling, and grand, gilded staircase. This fabulous function area, ideal for ceremonies and receptions, shares its grandeur with the Seven Spokes venue, home to lavish cocktail areas and a multi-sport simulator. Rotunda Building's more modern event spaces include Pier 35, a cool, urban-chic banquet hall with a bar, industrial interiors, a stylish underground feel, and an open floor plan. Pier 27 features a fun, vibrant foyer with gorgeous indoor greenery and colorful cocktail tables that are perfect for celebratory drinks after the vows. For a ceremony, reception, or after-party under the stars, look no further than the Transportation Area, an open-air site with plenty of room for dining, dancing, and food trucks. Your loved ones can bask in its breathtaking city views while they celebrate you. Here at Rotunda Building, no two weddings are the same, and their in-house coordinators go above and beyond to make your milestone occasion an expression of your style and personality. With the help of customizable packages, you get to celebrate exactly as you'd envisioned. From tables to chairs and lighting, all your equipment will be ready for you to use on the day. An eight-hour rental period gives you plenty of time for your event, and guests will have full access to the on-site parking at an additional fee. With setup and cleanup provided, you won't have to lift a single finger as you say, "I do."
