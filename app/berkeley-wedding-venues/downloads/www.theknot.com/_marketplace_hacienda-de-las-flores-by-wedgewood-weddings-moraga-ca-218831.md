rie (florals) did an amazing job on the flowers! The cake from Karen was great too. I would like to give special mention and recognition to the Hacienda de las Flores team - Steph (our wedding coordinator), Sarah (who we initially toured the venue with), and the banquet/bar staff (Jose, Rafa, and James) who made our experience so wonderful. The day of the wedding was carefully curated to fit my husband and I's needs. If I needed something, Steph was always there to step in and help. She's so sweet and lovely - we loved working with her! She went above and beyond what we expected and made our day so special. The only downside of our special day was the pre-recorded announcements were too quiet for our guests to hear. Our photographer had to rally our guests back from the bar to get everyone to sit down for our father-daughter dance, mother-son dance, and the parents speeches. Just note there is a noise ordinance/limitation with the reception.

lanning this wedding without the WW team which for us took care of most thing (food, decor, drinks, DJ). We went with the recommended florist (A love is in bloom) and bakery (Old towne danville) and thought both were wonderful. We did chose our own Officiant and Photographer however. The venue is gorgeous and the weather thankfully cooperated for a beautiful early fall day. They were great about working with us and our decor ideas and playlist ideas. We loved our wedding! The only downside to be aware of is the noise ordinance which prevents use of microphones in the outdoor patio during reception (only pre-recorded sound/speech is ok). this was not ideal but we knew this was the case when we booked the venue because it is that gorgeous. We did speeches indoors in the dance hall which worked out fine though not ideal. We also had a tiny sound mishap during our grand entrance due to the pre-recorded nature of things but overall not a big deal. Overall think this venue is awesome and would recommend though of course depends on what's most important to you!

ce to celebrate our big day. Not only is it stunning, but it’s also dog-friendly—which was a huge win for us since we got to include our dog in the celebration! The venue is all-inclusive, which took a huge weight off our shoulders during the planning process. From tables and linens to catering, dj, photobooth, bar, dessert and floral centerpieces, everything was handled with care and professionalism. And speaking of catering—the pork belly appetizer and beef carving station were absolute standouts. Our guests are still talking about how amazing the food was! Our coordinator, Steph went above and beyond to make everything seamless. They were incredibly responsive, detail-oriented, and calm under pressure. On the day-of, everything ran smoothly and we were free to just soak in every moment. One thing we really appreciated was the flexibility to bring in our own vendors. It gave us the freedom to personalize every aspect of our wedding while still having the support of a top-tier venue team. There was a bit of overlook on the table numbers which resulted in confusion with table seating but everything else was top notched! Thank you team for making our wedding day as magical as we imagined it will be. With love, George and Merril

wedding planning experience and she made it really easy for the two of us who were planning in under 5 months and totally overwhelmed! She totally saved us! And when unfortunately Chrissy got sick on the big day Jonny was able to step in and carry the big day forward without a hitch! All of our guests were super pleased with the easy and sophisticated flow of the service to dinner to dancing and they were thrilled by the dinner Buffet. We were comfortable the whole day, well taken care of and loved watching our loved ones have fun while we, new husband and wife, were able to concentrate on each other and really soak it all in. We are absolutely 1000% happy with how everything turned out, how the team made us feel unique and special by working with our special touches and requests, sending us home with a little meal to have later, and helping us pack everything back up. The florals were Spectacular! The music was perfect, the dessert buffet was delicious, the sparklers were a huge fun surprise for my husband and the photos were gorgeous! We have the most special memories of our wedding and love thinking back through the whole day. A huge thanks to everyone at Hacienda de las Flores by Wedgwood! We recommend them wholeheartedly to anyone looking for a down to earth special day with your love and your loved ones!

Rose sent me an email asking for a review of their services for my wedding. It took me almost a month to response due to the fact that all my close family and friends in attendance...

try to do our very best to just forget about it. But, since she insisted, I'll tell you my big problem with Wedgewood Weddings. After spending roughly $16,000, my DJ played the completely wrong song for my wedding party walking down the aisle (no he did not contact me in any way to tell me he couldn't find my song we discussed or anything). The girlies at Wedgewood did this really cool thing where they put all the outdoor games we wanted under a large tree in the dark with not even so much as a flashlight for my guests to enjoy themselves without rolling an ankle. It was very unsafe for anyone that attempt to play, and ultimately a total waste. They assured me that there would be heating for my guests as we were seated outdoors for our reception, but all my guests, including ones from North Dakota were freezing. I come to find out that the heaters were turned off at the request of a guest. Wedgewood neglected to run that past me before doing anything, however, they did interrupt me to ask if it was ok to turn the heat back on after hours of us freezing. I recall saying "well you didn't ask for my permission to turn it off... YES, turn it back on immediately." The whole schedule of my wedding was out of whack and not consistent with what we had discussed over video meetings numerous times. The DJ wasn't sure what to do, and once we were at about nightfall, the Wedgewood girlies were acting like they couldn't wait to leave. My beautiful filet mignon was cooked WELL DONE, and there was not a single soul from Wedgewood to check with me on how the meal was. My wedding party had to cut pieces of theirs to share with me! Another lovely experience my wedding party had was being scolded like children for drinking a particular alcohol that they erroneously left out for hours on the bar counter in the kinda lounge area they had set up for us to relax after the ceremony. My guests had no idea what was off limits as there were hors d'oeuvres, beer, liquor, and champagne all over it. The last nail in the coffin was the bartender being incredibly rude to my professional photographer that happens to be a good personal friend. Once my friend was done working diligently to capture as much beauty as she could from what was supposed to be my special day, she asked the bartender for a drink. The bartender looked my friend up then down and snarked "ya snooze, ya lose!" and continued packing up the bar. The only good thing this particular venue has about it is the aesthetic. Using Wedgewood is the biggest regret of my life. The only people that had any attention to detail or genuine helpfulness was the late night kitchen crew that Cristina was so eager to hand us off to so she could get out of there. I don't know if it was just the staff they had (because I know they have a lot of turn around) but Hacienda de las Flores by Wedgewood Weddings doesn't care about anyyyything once they get that last payment from you. You guys literally ruined my dream wedding. Also, I encourage Wedgewood Weddings to reach out to me via email and I will happily go into great detail about everything in this review. As for others that have used them and had a beautiful dream wedding, consider yourself lucky.

Wedgewood was extremely helpful throughout the process and made everything seamless. It was literally like you're at a restaurant and you're picking the items you want, and they'll...

take care of everything for you. I especially loved the DJ vendor they had as a recommendation. The sets were exactly the mood we were going for. One thing that sucked which it just makes sense for the layout of the venue, is the 'buffet' isn't much of a buffet once the dancing begins because the buffet is inside where the dance floor is so the food had to go away. Hopefully there could be some type of improvement here but it was totally understandable of the layout of the venue how they did it. I believe if you're considering a wedding here, it is best to book both areas for the ceremony AND reception. So easy for your guests and also beautiful for a cock tail hour. There is a lot of parking (FREE) so you have no issues with street parking. The layout for the dinner is also awesome because there's a lot of nice lighting they can hang while maintaining the greenery. 5/5 would get married here again. The day of coordination was also seamless. Photography was a bit behind but that's because we were all being drunk and stupid...in a fun manner. The costs might have gone up but we were fortunate enough to book during covid so if you want a deal, just wait soon enough for the next economic collapse.

Hacienda is a beautiful space for an outdoor wedding and has a lot to offer! My husband and I found the staff easy to work with and they were very responsive over email, which put ...

us at ease throughout the process. We were happy with the Wedgewood preferred vendors that we chose to work with, although we chose our own vendors for some services. Overall, they paid attention to detail and executed expertly. We appreciated little details, like when our day-of coordinator, Chrissy, brought us water bottles after the cocktail hour and how the staff even printed and framed a picture of our first kiss as husband and wife and placed it at our dinner table. The facilities are comfortable and beautiful. The bridal suite is spacious and great for photos. The venue has so many different beautiful spots for portraits - everything from manicured gardens to the Spanish architecture to the pavilion to the redwoods and the creek. There were a few minor things we wish had gone differently. We provided our own wine, and the venue forgot to serve it during dinner until we reminded them, and they also forgot to serve the rosé we bought for the cocktail hour. We had asked that wine be passed during cocktail hour and had been told that could be accommodated, but unfortunately they were not able to follow through, and that meant the bar line during the cocktail hour was very long. When we originally booked the venue, we had been told that the doors to the indoor space for dancing could remain open for the duration of the event, and that it would be free flowing from indoor to outdoor. Unfortunately, this was not the case. The security that the venue requires clients to hire was manning the doors during dancing, making sure they stayed closed at all times. This meant the dance floor was not very inviting, and it also meant that there was no music audible for guests who were outside eating cake, getting drinks, or mingling. If having a big dance party is the priority, this may not be the right venue for you. Overall, we were very happy with our experience at Hacienda. We would recommend other couples considering Hacienda work with the venue staff to find ways to make the bar line move faster and discuss how the venue handles the neighborhood noise restriction.

I had my wedding at Wedgewood Hacienda Spring 2023, and couldn’t have picked a better venue and place to have it at. Main points: Beautiful venue, Great service, and friendly staff...

. For a bride, it all went so smoothly, they were so great through the whole planning process, made it super easy to put the event together. I was never a big wedding person, so I was nervous about what kind of stress it would take to plan a wedding in the Bay Area, but Wedgewood guided us through all of it and I can’t recommend them enough if you want a pain-free wedding planning experience. There are still PLENTY of decisions to make and ways to customize, but they really help take care of all the logistics. The day-of coordination with Sarah was flawless. I had not a single worry day of and we felt so taken care of. She kept everything moving and perfectly on schedule. The venue itself is gorgeous and I couldn’t stop getting compliments from friends and family. Every single point of contact/vendor through Wedgewood was a gem, we loved our DJ & Photo Booth attendant through imobile and added on some additional vendors that they recommended. I was a little worried about the noise ordinance and having the dance floor indoors, but it turned out wonderfully for me, I like having the separate dance space and the music was bumping, we danced hard! The team at Wedgewood always went above and beyond whenever we met or I had random questions/requests, and really made my wedding special. I couldn’t have asked for a better day and wedding planning process with the Wedgewood team at Hacienda!

Coordinator: Sarah Banquet Captain: James Banquet Staff: Jenn, Jane, Kinzy, and Telitha Chef: Vince Florist: A Loves in Bloom DJ and Photobooth: iMobile Djs (Mike and Leo) Cake: Old Towne Danville Bakery I would recommend any of the vendors they use and of course, book your special day here.

We loved Hacienda de las Flores! They really brought our dream wedding to life. Sarah, the event coordinator, was organized and punctual, and the banquet captain, James, was super ...

helpful for the remainder of the night after she had to leave. All of the service staff was great (I wished I had gotten/remembered their names, but it was such a fast-paced night) and I want to give them a special shout-out for making my family feel so comfortable, conversing with our guests, and even hyping us up on the dance floor! An even more special shout-out has to go to the DJ, Mike, or DJ MaveWave. He made the night SO fun. Our guests couldn't leave the dance floor and stayed until the very end! He took the playlist I gave him and made it a masterpiece and so balanced! Also, the photo booth coordinator, Leo, was so nice and made everyone feel so at ease. Both of our families are Filipino, and so is he, so he had some awesome cultural props for us to use that our families for a huge kick out of. There were a few hiccups. For example, we paid for the package that came with an open bar for beer, wine, and well liquors. However, the bartender that night (I didn't get her name) was charging my guests for small sodas to chase their shots of alcohol, some of my guests got charged for wine and beer while others didn't, and the ones that did get charged were getting charged with inconsistent prices throughout the night. People came expecting to be able to enjoy drinks on us, but that wasn't the case and many people were very confused. As the bride and groom, this wasn't exactly a fire we wanted to have to put out on our special day, but we were getting comments left and right about this. I asked about this and she (the bartender) said that yes, beer, wine, and well liquors are free, but when I mentioned what was happening, she implied that my guests were mistaken with their orders and did in fact order other things that they had to be charged for. That didn't seem the case when I spoke to people, but it was a minor inconvenience to an otherwise perfect night that ran so smoothly. In the end, people didn't mind paying here and there to have a good time, it just wasn't what we had expected to happen. By the end of the night, our guests had nothing but positive things to say about the venue and how beautiful and hospitable the staff was. Clean-up at the end was also a breeze. The staff had all of our personal decor cleaned up and packed with care, ready for us to take home. All in all, I thought the night was magical and the venue played a really big part in that. Personally, as a bride, I expected to be pulled left and right by the staff to keep on schedule, but I was rarely pulled aside or bothered. Everything just happened naturally and I was able to spend the time with our guests that I wanted to.

We were probably one of the early couples to use this venue after Wedgewood took over and had a great wedding! Perhaps the only drawback is the early end time required by the city ...

(10pm). Other than that, I can only say positive things! The Wedgewood team was a star to work with: kind, polite, organized, prepared, and as accommodating as possible. And all of that is not to mention the actual space, which is truly stunning. Highly recommend.

When we booked this venue, we booked through Town of Moraga (before Wedgewood took over as event /property management). For the price through the Town, size of multiple outdoor loc...

ations, and the incredible natural beauty of the venue, we fell in love with this venue immediately. The Town contract had a lot of misc rules (relating to sound, decor, and liquor) but totally manageable for a modern traditional wedding. The transition of vendors to Wedgewood was overall okay but some hiccups in terms of what indoor space we signed for and were told we could use by the Town and actually could use - this became an issue as we did have rain during our wedding week. Alissa the GM addressed issue with professionalism and care, and we lucked into their rain tent and contingency plan. We wished this solution was shared upfront and didn’t require us to escalate and point to our signed contract. Beyond this, we loved the space and would recommend to other couples, though the pricing, preferred vendors and specifics will be through Wedgewood and more structured so be sure to review their packages closely.

I had my wedding here October, 2013 and we had a great time. We had a ~60 person count (guests and wedding party). First, the rules are a little restrictive (no flower petals/r...

ice/confetti, no hard liquor, certain time restrictions) but it actually wasn't a turnoff for us. We didn't want to have hard liquor anyway and we weren't expecting to have a crazy party that went until 2 am. We wound up getting an extra hour on top of their standard package so that our vendors would have enough time for setup and we would be able to have the venue as late as possible (music off and bar closed at 9 pm, guests out by 10, vendors out by 11). We really had enough time to do everything we wanted (with a 3:30 ceremony start time... that actually started at 3:50, but hey, that's normal). To get around the no flower petals/confetti/rice rule, we went with full flowers for the flower girl (she passed them out to the guests) and bubbles! Bubbles are really nice and my sister actually used them for her wedding years ago. We got both the Pavilion and the Hacienda, and I would really recommend that. We had our ceremony at the Pavilion, dinner at the fountain at the Hacienda and then the after party back down at the Pavilion. Doing this gives the vendors a chance to work on one space while all the guests are at the other. The pavilion was nicely transformed during dinner and we got what we wanted for both the ceremony and the dancing. Kimberly was really helpful in answering questions and working with us to make sure we got what we wanted while not breaking any of their rules. They are actually very accommodating with how they handle their rules and can make suggestions for optional ideas. They provide a list of recommended vendors. If you use a DJ or Caterer off their list you will have to provide an additional deposit, but their lists are fairly extensive and unless you have someone specific in mind you shouldn't have to go off their list. It was a big help during the planning process to have this list as we got our caterer, DJ, lighting, florist, and photographer from them. The space is beautiful and actually quite cheap as far as venues are concerned. I would recommend it as long as the rules aren't a deal breaker.

I fell in love with this venue the moment I drove onto the property! The grounds are huge and were amazingly beautiful for our October wedding! It fulfilled all of my requirements ...

on paper, but in person it exceeded my expectations - especially for the amount we paid. I learned quickly that city owned parks may offer fewer services with event rental, but they charge much less than an exclusive wedding venue. Even after having to hire rentals, my own dinner caterer, and dessert caterer it was still significantly less money. PROs: 1)The Grounds - Gorgeous and abundant, even in the fall. Plenty of flower, historic and has lots of character. Several options for ceremony placement and endless excellent places for wonderful photos! And, we had the ceremony and reception both at the Hacienda so there was no time wasted on travel. 2)The Staff - fast and efficient when answering my (many) questions and inquiries. 3)The Fireplace Room - we had a wonderful indoor option for the ceremony just in case the weather was bad (and we ended up using it). It did not rain on the day of, but it did for 3 solid days before and so the grass where we had planned on having the ceremony was a little soggy. In the end, I think the fireplace room was perfect for our ceremony anyway, so it worked out for the best. 4) Bride's Dressing Room - there was a large room for me and my girls to get ready in so that we did not have to travel in our dresses. 5)HUGE kitchen - our caterer had plenty of room to work his magic. 6)More than enough free parking! CONs: 1) Music must be off by 9pm and everyone must be off the grounds by 10pm 2)Caterers, servers and all of those extras are NOT provided. They provide a "recommended" list but you must provide a deposit for off-list caterers and/or DJ or Bands. The deposit check is only a security deposit that they hold and only cash if there is damage - we got ours back, no problem. 3) Due to Liability Issues they cannot store any parishables at all and have very limited space for anything else overnight. It is understandable, but be aware that you will need to plan ahead where all of it will go and who will be in charge of it all. 4) No throwing of rice or scattering of petals ...no sparklers allowed... and no isle runners on the lawn. This was no issue for us, but I know some brides would be disappointed to not have an isle runner or flowergirl that can scatter petals. We had bubbles instead! It was a perfect day for us!

The Pavilion at the Hacienda de las Flores is the perfect venue for an intimate wedding ceremony. My husband and I were married there on October 1st, 2010. The secluded walled gar...

den emphasized the intimate feel of our 40-person wedding. The corinthian columns of what used to be a private pool house were a beautiful backdrop for our simple and understated aesthetic. The dinner room further promoted a close and intimate feel during our sit-down dinner, and the patio and lawn were a perfect setting for wine and dessert under the stars. If you are planning an intimate wedding, with a small guest list, check out the Pavilion at the Hacienda de las Flores. If, like us, you don't care about having a weekend wedding, you will be very pleased with the amazingly affordable rental rate for weekday events.
