I seriously cannot hype up our wedding videographer and content creator enough, Zach & Dakota. They’re such an amazing couple and honestly just good people to have around on a big,...

stressful day. They made everything feel easy and fun, and they captured moments I didn’t even realize were happening. I’m so thankful to have these videos to look back on, especially because my husband’s brother is currently deployed in the Navy. Being able to send him the video so he could still feel a part of our day meant so much to us. That alone made the whole thing priceless. And honestly, one of my favorite parts? They didn’t just film the wedding; they were part of the energy. They even danced with us on the dance floor, and it was so awesome having them hype everyone up. It felt like they were guests who just happened to be insanely talented at capturing everything. The videos turned out beautiful, but what I loved just as much was how comfortable they made us feel. Nothing felt forced or awkward; everything was super natural and genuine. Honestly, choosing them was one of the best decisions we made for the wedding. We’ll treasure these videos forever, and I’m just really grateful for how much heart they put into everything. Highly recommend them to anyone getting married.

Where do I even begin?! Zach and Dakota were truly incredible! From the moment we had our meeting and met them, they were an absolute dream to work with: kind, professional, and su...

ch a fun duo to have on our wedding day. They brought such a calming, joyful energy that made everything feel effortless. Now, let’s talk about our wedding video…I have no words. The moment I watched it, I was in tears!! It was everything I hoped for and more. Zach’s attention to detail is unmatched. We had a couple of edits we needed, and he made those changes quickly and graciously, always checking in to make sure it was exactly what we wanted. Since we don’t post our daughter online, Zach even went above and beyond to create two versions — one with her blurred and one just for us to keep. That thoughtfulness meant the world. The final product had that dreamy, filmy, grainy aesthetic I adore and it was executed perfectly. You can just feel the passion Zach pours into his work. He truly captures moments with such emotion and artistry. I genuinely can’t recommend Zach and Dakota enough. They are talented, compassionate, and just amazing humans to have on your team during such a special and once in a life time moment. Thank you both for giving us memories that will last a lifetime.
