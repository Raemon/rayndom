Hi I'm Minh. I am a simple man who loves making photographs and videos. I am fortunate to be able to spend a good amount of time on personal projects, traveling and collaborating with a team of rad people. I make my bed in Conway, Arkansas and am a sucker for weddings where I have the opportunity to travel.

Words can barely express the gratitude we feel for Minh and Phaminh Cinematography for making our Jamaican wedding incredibly special. We faced multiple postponements due to COVID,...

but Minh stuck with us through thick and thin. We chose Jamaica for its stunning landscapes and delicious cuisine, and Minh made sure to capture the essence of this beautiful island and its significance to us in the video. His attention to detail in documenting our preparations at the Hyatt Ziva Rose Hall Resort, our intimate first look, and our lively indoor reception was truly remarkable. Staying at the venue for five days, Minh gave us his all — capturing not just the big moments but also the nuances that make a wedding personal and unique. The food was phenomenal, and the hospitality was unbeatable, something Minh also managed to capture in our wedding film. We felt exceptionally lucky to celebrate this chapter of our love story surrounded by our closest friends and family, all of whom have been beautifully memorialized in the footage. Minh, thank you for being more than a videographer; you were a part of our family during those days.

He is very accomadating to your needs and budget, and also very entertaining to work with. He will go the extra mile to make sure your video really captures the essence of your wedding and will give you all the feels. I really reccomend to all future brides to consider hiring a cinematographer for your special day. A video really helps you relive your wedding day in a way that photos can’t. Not discrediting photographers ( I def recommend both!). Years from now, you’ll be able to share your wedding day with your children and loved ones. Choose Minh to capture that day, you won’t regret it.
