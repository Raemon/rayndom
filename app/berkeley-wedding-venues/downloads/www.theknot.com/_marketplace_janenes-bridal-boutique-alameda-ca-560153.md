I had a fantastic experience with Janene's in Alameda for both shopping and alterations! I had two appointments to try on dresses - the first (with Leslie) was just to explore and ...

see what I liked. The second (with Sabrina) was to revisit my three favorites and place the order. I was *very* nervous about wedding dress shopping, but I was so pleasantly surprised by how fun it was. I didn't feel any pressure and the stylists were knowledgable about their inventory and made great recommendations to help me make the right choice. I'm in LOVE with my dress - Derrick by Maggie Sottero. Milka in the alterations department helped me with tailoring to make sure the fit was perfect and to remove some volume so it didn't overwhelm me - I'm only 5'2" and it's a big ballgown! I knew I'd be paying more to do alterations in-house, but for me it was worth the extra cost for their expertise and the convenience of having everything all in one place. Also, my (now) husband worked with the staff to secretly buy me a beautiful bracelet that would work with my whole look on the day and he said they were very sweet and helpful. I definitely recommend Janene's!

I had the most incredible experience at Janene’s Bridal in San Francisco! The entire appointment felt so special & personalized. I booked a 1.25-hour appointment for myself and 3 ...

guests—my mom, sister, and grandma. We were able to order a bottle of champagne, which came a cute bar cart, with complimentary chocolates & fresh berries—a lovely touch. Even though my scheduled time was supposed to be just over an hour, Kimberly went above and beyond, allowing me to try on well past the time, so that I could try on every dress my family & I had selected. Her patience, attentiveness, & warm personality made what could have been an overwhelming day feel effortless and fun! It was a meaningful moment to have my guests there, and so comfortable. , I’m so grateful for how accommodating & welcoming the team was. I look forward to my next visit to Janene’s Bridal & recommend them to any bride-to-be looking for a special, stress-free, & memorable dress-shopping experience!

king. It was a "surprise dress" in that it wasn't the style I had in mind, but was the easiest yes! The shop itself is so cute and we loved the mimosas and macarons add on. I also had a fantastic experience with Jennifer and Milca during my fittings and alterations! Both were so knowledgeable and great to work with. I had some significant changes in mind and they took great notes/videos/photos to make sure the alterations team had all the info. It was a fun and exciting experience. Everyone I worked with was friendly, welcoming, and made me feel like the most important person in the room. I am proud to be a Janene's bride!!

friends did. It was lovely to have a side of tea, and biscuits. There was also champagne. The booking of an appointment was easy and the alterations done at this space made it much easier for a one stop shop. I appreciated that part. Overall, great choices and I was happy to say I found my show stopping dress here!

Buying my dress at Janene's was actually great. So please keep in mind the review below is ONLY for my experience with the alterations department. Let's start with a timeline. 12...

/16/2022- I had my fitting and bought my dress for my wedding on 8/19/23 (thinking I had PLENTY of time). I decided that I wanted to have a keyhole put in the back, so alterations were needed. 12/20/2022- I was sent an email with descriptions of the type of lace, and costs. I respond back the same day and pay the next day 12/21. 3/18/2023-I come in for my first fitting, excited I bring a girlfriend. I try on my dress (still excited at this point). Alterations doesn't do anything really and when I mentioned the keyhole, they had NO idea what I was talking about. I told them I paid and ordered it back in December...Nothing. So we make another appointment to come in and they'll order the lace. 4/19/2023- I arrive for my now second fitting. Fabric still has not been purchased. No note in my file about wanting a keyhole. I told the alterations person (Austin, who was VERY helpful and kind) but was then left there, in my dress standing for 30 minutes while they tried to "resolve" the situation. 4/20/2023- I write a frustrated email asking for a a refund on the $50 worth of lace that has yet to be ordered but that was paid for (which was ignored). I get a call from the head of alterations saying that the lace WAS ordered, but that the dress manufacturers prioritize fabric for the dresses not alterations... even though it was "ordered in December" opposite of wedding season. I didn't have time to argue but was feeling gaslit. I just wanted to get my dress done and be done with it all. I was assured the lace would be there by my next fitting. At this point, I felt I still had time. 5/18/2023- Third fitting. No lace. All we did was pin some batting down to get a shape of the key hole but my dress' seams are all out and I cant get any idea of how it's going to look. We literally take a picture and draw it with an ipad so I can at least imagine what it will look like. By this point I'm just completely defeated. I'm told, we have the shape so when the lace comes in it will be ALL done and we don't have to do anything. Also, they'll call me as soon as the lace gets in. Late July I called them since I still had not received a notification of the lace coming in and now I'm actually nervous my dress wont be ready for my freaking wedding. Nothing, no call back. 8/10/23 (a little over a week before my wedding and supposedly my LAST fitting). The key hole is FINALLY on with the lace. my friend meets me there, we do the bustle, but the dress is too long. Fine, that's why we planned early and of course I have to come back. 8/17/2023 TWO days before the wedding, I try on the dress one more time and an quarter of the bustle is missing and dragging on the ground. We wait for 45 MORE minutes for them to fix. No alterations person comes out to talk to me but sends their messenger to give me a discount on the bustle... I'm SO over it. I love my dress, I love how it came out. But I also had all the fun and excitement of getting a wedding dress taken out of the entire process and when I look at it I also remember this frustrating process. I felt gaslit and ignored and really because I wasn't a loud complainer they didn't try to make things better. Unless you have MORE than a year before your wedding, take your Janene's dress somewhere else for alterations. I wish I had.

Janene's is a great place to buy a dress, especially if you're plus sized. They actually have a selection. There was a bit of a snafu with the rush order on my dress as it arrived...

a month later than expected. But they worked with the designer to make sure it got here as quickly as possible. I also did my alterations with them, and while they weren't cheap, they did an excellent job and it was done on time by the date!

Shopped for my dress at the San Francisco location and it was such a fun, exciting (of course) experience. A wonderful selection of dresses for all fashion types. My dress consulta...

nt was a joy to work with and her patience was very appreciated. I leave off 1 star for 2 reasons… 1/2 star deduction as at time of purchase I was unexpectedly presented with “tipping” my consultant. It’s been 14 months since I purchased my dress (2/2022) and if I correctly recall the explanation for tipping is that they do not receive commission/bonuses, but do have required sales goals. Further explained that a tip is optional; my consultant was so helpful & accommodating that I would have felt bad not giving her a tip (tips can be any dollar amount or percentage you feel appropriate). The additional 1/2 star deduction is for measurements taken at time of ordering & alterations. I neither gained nor lost weight in the 10 months between ordering and first fitting yet my dress was extremely too small. The alterations took 5 fittings and an additional cost of $1,500 (dress [before alterations expense] with tax & tip was $3,600). I believe there must have been some sort of error when my measurements were initially taken as the consultant may not have been measuring in exactly the correct places. It may be wise to have an actual seamstress take the measurements. I am fortunate that the unexpected expenses were manageable, but just think it is important to note these 2 items for others. In the end though, I was extremely pleased with my dress and how I looked.

ress. Had a few questions and Janene came out with EXTREME attitude, fat shamed me, did not listen when I answered questions she asked me, and threw a mirror and after leaving that day I second guessed my choice in dress, and lost all confidence. Would highly recommend trying elsewhere and wish I listened to others when the told me not to go here and especially avoid the alterations department.

I had the most incredible wedding dress shopping experience at Janene’s Bridal. First of all, the place is absolutely stunning and welcoming with a wide variety of wedding dresses....

Most importantly my stylist, Maesa, was simply the best and made the experience what it was. Maesa was kind, compassionate, knowledgeable, and attentive throughout the whole process. They never made me feel rushed and I felt 1000% beautiful and comfortable throughout the entire appointment. Maesa asked all the right questions and helped me pick the whimsy dress I’ve always dreamed about since I was a little girl. It is truly a dream. They made wedding dress shopping a magical and fun experience all around. I couldn’t be more grateful. Because of Maesa and Janene’s Bridal Boutique, I said YES to the dress. I can’t wait to come back to try on my dress. Thank you again, Maesa!

My mom and I even ordered custom jewelry from their jeweler put together on the spot that matched perfectly with our dresses. I know multiple people who have gotten their wedding dresses from Janene's since and it's obvious why, they are amazing.

d the whole ambience of the store is romantic and fun and whimsical. I went shopping with my mom and my sister which felt like the perfect number given the space for our dressing room. All three of us explored the dresses on display to tag which ones we wanted to try, and the Janene’s staff also helped pull a couple options once they got a sense for my style. They were extremely patient while I tried on dresses more than once and did not pressure us when we left without purchasing that day. My mom and I returned a couple days later to revisit a favorite dress and Maesa assisted us, who was AMAZING! He ended up pulling one last dress for me that he thought I would like and it ended up being the winner. We also used Janene’s alteration group for some pretty straightforward alterations, and everyone on that side of the business was so sweet and helpful and easy to work with. They did an incredible job with the dress and made some great recommendations on shoes, jewelry, veil, and hair accessories as well. From scheduling to staff interactions to the final product, Janene’s was so easy to work with and gave me exactly what I wanted. Highly recommend!

Being a bride during the pandemic definitely has it's challenges, especially with the shipping delays. Prior to Janene's, I had already tried on dresses at a few different shops so...

I already had a style in mind that I really liked so I came prepared. My stylist picked a few different dresses but had found the (almost perfect) dress. The plunge neckline was a bit too revealing for my conservative family, but luckily, the designer has a modest version of the dress which was perfect. Fast forward 4 months later, I get the call that the dress is in and I was ready for my first fitting! However, when I showed up, the dress that had arrived was the original plunge and not the one I had ordered! YIKES! Definitely didn't help the stress levels. It took a few days to resolve but Jen was on top of it. Turned out to be a system error when the order was placed, and re-sending the correct dress would mean the dress wouldn't arrive until a week before the wedding so that was not going to be an option. Jen comped the alterations for the added modesty, and assured me that no one would ever know alterations were made. Jen is fantastic and really helped alleviate some of the stress because the final product with the modesty alterations was a mystery until I went to pick up my dress a few days prior to the wedding. While it was a little more stressful than I had anticipated the dress experience to be, Jen really made sure that I was taken care of and provided the reassurance I needed. I'd have to say tough, both the dress and the alterations were a bit pricier than I had originally anticipated. Overall, the customer service and experience was good despite the hiccup. And the dress came out great!

Janene's is the best. One of the best experiences I had while dress shopping, and that experience continued through the dress buying process and alterations. Staff were super helpf...

ul and let you really take your time (I've stayed past closing more than once). Once I found "the dress" they took my measurements and ordered the dress, which took about 5 months to arrive. Once the dress arrived, I picked it up and they offered to start alterations. I was hesitant at first to decide on alterations before pricing out some other places, but ultimately happy to choose them because they did a good job. Alterations were expensive though!! Almost cost as much as the dress itself (which was relatively affordable) - just be prepared!! I had 3 fittings total. The first fitting was just to get my measurements as soon as the dress arrived. The second fitting was about 1 month before the wedding to make sure nothing had changed and to start work on the hem and bustle. The bustle was by far the most expensive part, and honestly looks a bit weird in the end... I wish detachable trains were a more popular style! But with my dress design, I didn't have much of a choice. The final fitting was the week of the wedding where they make sure everything is perfect and teach out how to walk, sit, and move around in your dress. They also teach your people how to do the bustle and help you go to the bathroom! Really helpful stuff. During the "final" fitting, I found a couple of issues with the dress. They agreed to fix them on the spot before I officially picked up the dress, and everything was perfect for the big day. For dancing, etc during the reception, I needed the dress to be bustled and I took the shoulder straps off so I could move my arms. This worked really well for me, and I was able to dance all night with no issues at all. Overall, I think their prices (for dresses at least) are very reasonable and the shopping experience was unbeatable. At least stop by to check out their impressive inventory!

t any of the other places. From the moment I walked in, I felt that I was never rushed and Asurah was so calming and helpful. She even took tons of photos from different angles to help me decide. When I came back with my sister to try on the two dresses I loved the most, she remembered everything I had talked to her about and helped me with ideas of various alterations that could be made. She even made sure she could price match for other places I had seen the same dress at. The selection is great and I never felt rushed or pressured at all. Not to mention, the option of adding a couple of glasses of prosecco for when I chose the dress was extra fun! This place has all of the small boutique vibes with the perks of a wide selection. 10/10 would recommend to any Bay Area bride.

ion or another. The dress I loved was a little over my budget, but they worked with me to come up with a payment plan and it all sorted itself out. I also got my dress altered through their alterations department and I was extremely impressed with every single person's professionalism and eye for details. Having never been fitted for a dress before, they were straightforward with me and answered any questions I had. As we got close to my wedding date I realized the neckline wasn't looking the way I hoped, and they quickly fixed it before my next fitting. They also altered my mother's veil, so that it would go with my dress, and it looked perfect as well. I didn't shop around for pricing at other alterations locations, but I would say that I never thought I was being over charged and I never thought my dress was in the wrong hands. I never worried that the dress wouldn't be ready for my wedding either. I would definitely recommend Janene's to anyone shopping for a wedding dress.

Janene's Bridal is wonderful. The staff are caring, kind, and warm, the salon is luxurious, and I felt like a pampered princess every time I was there. I'm a plus-sized bride (si...

ze 22), and was very self-conscious about fitting into dresses in a "normal" store so I went to a couple different places. Janene's sales staff made me feel like family. Janene herself is a no-nonsense woman who obviously loves making each dress fit the bride perfectly. She's also a genius with fabric. Once my dress arrived (9 months!) Janene worked with me to alter the dress to fit my vision. My fittings with Jennifer were fun, and I felt beautiful every time (something I rarely feel in any clothing store.) There's so much more to wearing a wedding dress than just putting on a dress, and Jennifer made sure I was comfortable in the dress and had all the tools to make it perfect on my wedding day. The dress ended up gorgeous, exactly what I wanted, and hemmed to perfection. I got married on grass so I was worried about stepping on it, but they compensated for that!

I bought and had my dress altered at Janene's and had such a wonderful experience throughout the entire process! Carla was my stylist and she so sweet and patient with my group an...

d me. She gave us a tour of the entire store, pointing out different designers and price ranges, gave us a bag of clips to mark any dresses we were interested in, and let us loose! I told her what I was looking for, so she added some selections of her own as well. Despite trying on a bunch of dresses (including a couple of over the top gowns just for fun), I ultimately wound up going with the dress she picked out for me, which turned out to be well under my budget. She really knows her stuff! We had such a fun time singing along to the music playing in the store and she even let a few members of my group try on some veils for a fun impromptu photoshoot. Since Janene's was my first wedding dress shopping stop, I was hesitant to commit to a dress without checking out other stores first. Carla was so understanding and didn't pressure me at all to make a decision on the spot. She told me that they would keep my dress information and measurements on file in case I decide later on to go through with the purchase. I shouldn't have had my doubts--I called back to order the dress immediately after a mediocre experience at another bridal boutique! Months later when my dress arrived, I worked with Brooke in alterations. She really took her time asking me if there were any changes I wanted to make to my dress to make it perfect and patiently explained all of my options and pricing. Then, Janene herself came by to pin my dress and make alteration recommendations. I came back for a few more appointments, targeting different areas of the dress each time. There was so much attention to detail and I could tell that the whole alterations team really worked hard to make every aspect of my dress perfect. I was also given suggestions on how to look best while wearing my dress and how to move in it. They also taught my bridesmaids how to get me into my dress and how to do the bustle. On the day before my wedding, they had me try on the dress one last time (it fit like a glove!) then had it fluffed and bagged, ready to go for the big day. I can't recommend Janene's enough. Every staff member I encountered was so sweet and I truly felt that they really cared about making everything perfect for me. They even gave me a discount for being a nurse! Thank you so much!

r trying on about 8, she combined the ideas I’d mentioned and pulled a dress out from the back for me to try on. That was THE ONE! An amazing experience and I have been continuously impressed with their level of service during the alterations process. One final note - I also very much appreciate the fact that they stored all of the COVID-19 brides’ dresses without a single worry. My wedding my next delayed, but my dress is in good hands. HIGHLY recommend!

I live in SC, but went to Janenes because I was visiting my brother and wanted him to be there with me. First of all, the store is beautiful. There are so many to pick from. I h...

ad done research and wanted to go as a plus size bride because of the great amount of plus size dresses they offer. Jackie was my bridal consultant, and I legit can not say enough nice things about her. First she made sure I felt like I could pick any dress in the store, not just plus sizes. I ended up picking plus sizes because I was nervous but I did show her one dress on Instagram I really loved. It was the only sample size one I tried on and I fell in love! I knew it was the one. Let me tell you, dress shopping is stressful. But Jackie made sure I did not feel over whelmed the whole time. She constantly checked on me. You could tell she was reading me the whole time to make sure I went at my pace. I was nervous to buy the dress in California and not closer to where I lived and what I liked is that they did not push me. They let me know they priced matched, which I liked even more when they honored that deal. I ordered the dress when I got home, and they were good about communicating with me even from two different coasts. When my dress got in ( a lot sooner than I thought!!) they sent me a good twenty pictures so I can see what it was like. I HIGHLY recommend this place. You will not be disappointed!

y there to help you find the dress of your dreams. I tried on a few dresses before they were able to piece together what I did/didn’t love and find the dress I fell in love with. I came back a couple months later during their sample sale and found my second dress here as well. Wouldn’t recommend any other place but Janene’s! Such a large variety in dresses in a very affordable range of prices. There is honestly a dress here for everyone’s style AND budget!!

hoped it would all work out! I was so surprised how smooth the process went, I said what I was thinking and we started to create it! At fittings I was weary because of course I couldnt see it finish till the end, but I said what I liked and didn't like at each fitting and it wasn't done till I said it was done. After about 5 fittings I was so happy, I couldn't wait! The girls are so nice and made me feel so good since my family couldn't come with me and Janene made me so beautiful! I didnt think I could look that good! Janene made me so happy! My wedding was perfect! Thank you Janene and their consultants!!!!! Don't go anywhere else for a custom dress!

d yummy treats. Their process of selecting a dress made it more special. I was given 7 yellow pins (6 girls and 1 for me) and I brought each of my bridesmaids with me around the store to select a dress they think fits me best. When it was time to try on the dresses everyone was able to help me narrow it down. Funny that I picked the dress I chose. All in all the customer service was awesome all around especially Briana and Julie who made sure we were comfortable and our glasses filled with champagne. What topped my experience was that I won a raffle for their 11 year anniversary and was able to apply my winnings toward the balance of my dress! Whaaat?! They have a great selection of different styles and designers neatly categorized. If you need a dress in the bay area go here! I can’t wait to head back for my first fitting!

any things you are most excited about and I felt like with two completely different looks, they were able to cater to my needs and vision. I even ended up bringing my bridesmaid dress to be altered there too, because why not? For the 4 months leading up to my wedding for dress alterations, I was able to have Brooke with me. That helped with the consistency of my vision and she knew exactly what I wanted and communicated with the alterations team. My dresses fit like a glove and I could not recommend them more! Every time I set foot in my appointments they were very attentive and asked questions about fit I didn't even think about. I felt like a bridal queen and loved the customer service experience, especially during a very stressful time. For future brides, definitely invest in a great alterations team, because you want to feel beautiful, comfortable and like the dress fits you like a glove and they were able to make that happen for me!

I had the best experience at Janene's Bridal. I scheduled my first try on appointment and had a great experience with my stylist, Leah. She really learned my style and made sure me...

and my support crew had a good time, despite the appointment being during COVID. Janene's did a great job limiting appointments and guests and asked that everyone wear a mask to ensure we were following the guidelines. We ordered some champagne and charcuterie, which made the try on appointment a lot more enjoyable. I didn't end up finding the "one" at the first appointment, so I scheduled another appointment at Janene's annual sample sale. They paired me with Leah again, which was perfect. She found the dress that wound up being the "one" and suggested the perfect veil that looked absolutely gorgeous with the dress. I never felt rushed or pressured to buy anything, which was very important to me. With my wedding a year away, Janene's is storing my dress until I start the alterations process. Overall, my experience buying my wedding dress at Janene's was a great experience and everything I could have hoped for from a bridal boutique. I can't wait to wear the dress next year!

And I highly recommend Jenna as your bridal consultant, she was never pushy but always gave the perfect amount of encouragement and support while also checking in on how I felt. She really made our whole experience.

Save your self from stress, tears, and emotional distress; don't go to Janene's Bridal Boutique. Horrible business ethics. Horrible customer service AFTER you buy the dress. They ...

are very dishonest. Wedding planning is stressful enough. Janene's Bridal Boutique added onto the stress and anxiety. Eventhough I ordered my dress 10 months before the wedding, yet I got my dress 2 months before my wedding. They don't make wedding planning easier. Worst experience ever. I spoke with the owner and she didn't care about the poor service they have. She simply blamed it all on her daughter. Apparently her daughter does the ordering and the owner does the alterations. At the beginning they provided me a date for when it will arrive but then the day comes and they don't know where it is and when it will arrive. Then a whole month passes. They call me to tell me they think they have an idea. By this point I start stressing because I only have 3 months before the wedding. Eventually, I get a call that the dress arrived, by this point I only have 2 months before the wedding. They pretty much force the customers to get it altered by them based on the little time frame they provide. Lastly, they over charge for alterations as well. At the end you leave feeling stressed and foolish for buying your dress from such a dirty boutique. Refer back to the many bad reviews it has on Yelp. They all have a pattern. This place is full of empty excuses.

p as a positive sign. I filled out the online form and within 24 hours, I confirmed an appointment within my desired time frame. I have to admit, I was a bit nervous going into my appointment given that I am very indecisive/picky when it comes to buying any type of dress. However, the staff member I worked with made me feel comfortable! She was very kind, patient and funny! I am forgetting her name (sorry!) but we bonded over our shared introverted nature! I tried on 5 dresses based off styles I favored via Pinterest and went with the one my stylist recommended (she found a happy median between two styles I was drawn too). During my appointment, I felt heard and the overall experience was easy. Now, my approaching wedding feels so much more real! I am so happy this boutique was my FIRST AND ONLY stop for wedding dress shopping! THANK YOU JANENE'S BRIDAL BOUTIQUE! REVIEW ON ALTERATIONS: I also completed my alterations here and wanted to express my greatest appreciation for how beautiful my dress turned out! I am so grateful that the alternations were done in such a short period of time - despite being delivered LATE by the designer! Your team made me feel at ease during such a stressful time and for that I cannot thank you all enough!

I also really appreciated the flexibility of the alterations schedule. Such a wonderful experience, I cannot recommend Janene's more!

g quaint in size. My appointment was in early March 2019, and my wedding date was set for August 31st, 2019, so I had a short timeline. I went in with a $4,000 budget for everything, dress, alterations, and veil and was able to stay within budget, and everything arrived on time. There were so many dresses to choose from in my budget; it was nice to feel like each dress I pulled I could purchase. My dress was a beautiful ball gown with a beaded bodice and a luxurious heavy satin skirt in a gorgeous ivory color that looked beautiful against my pale complexion. The alternations team was amazing, their hours were incredibly convenient as I live in San Francisco and needed to drive to Alameda for three fittings prior to the wedding, they have late hours a couple of nights during the week with the last appointment at 7:30 pm I was able to make it across the bay in traffic with time to spare. My dress was everything I had always dreamed of; it was so fun to dance and spin in, it fit perfect so I could walk, sit, kneel, and dance the night away. Thank you, Janene and team- my dress was absolutely stunning, and I felt beautiful every moment I was able to wear it.

After having an underwhelming dress shopping experience at a bridal salon closer to home, we decided to make the trek out to Janene's Bridal Boutique despite the long drive. Our c...

onsultant, Cynthia, was very warm and welcoming for our appointment. There was a wide variety of dresses available in the store from numerous designers and she assured us that there would be something from every price point. We were allowed to wander and pull dresses without any rush and she was very helpful in taking down our feedback on what we liked or didn't like for each dress I tried on. I ended up ordering a dress I had tried on elsewhere because the customer service at Janene's was exceptional. Communication was always prompt, such as informing me when my dress had arrived. Alterations were unexpectedly pricey, but I received a significant discount due to purchasing my dress during a promotional weekend. The alterations appointments were more frequent leading up to the wedding date, but any last minute changes were covered in the initial cost. During our final fitting, the alterations manager Jennifer was very patient in explaining to my bridesmaids how to bustle and maintain the dress to ensure maximum floof for photos. Parking outside the bridal salon could be quite difficult during busy hours. (It's mostly street metered parking.) This can be especially hard on dress pick-up days if you need to carry it to your car! They are very popular, so though our first few appointments were on the weekends, the last few alterations appointments fell on weekdays. Since you will need someone with you on your final fitting, it's good to have advance warning. My dress looked perfect on our special day and it fit like a glove. I couldn't recommend the lovely ladies at Janene's more!
