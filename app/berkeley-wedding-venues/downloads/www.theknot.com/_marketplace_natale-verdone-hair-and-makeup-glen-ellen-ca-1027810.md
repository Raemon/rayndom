My now husband and I used Natale for make up and hair for the women in our wedding parties. Everyone left the session with Natale feeling amazing! Natale is one of those 'I feel go...

od energy' types who is just so pure and calming. I can personally say that she was totally a partner in this process and made so much of our day easy, especially considering that this was the starting process to our day. Natale is totally an expert and helped so much with fine details and making sure everyone was looking perfect for our big day. You will totally be in amazing hands with her- she communicates regularly and does an incredible job in understanding what her clients needs are.

Natale was amazing! I was really worried about getting my hair and makeup done for my wedding. I wanted to look gorgeous obviously, but I wanted to look like me. From the moment I...

did the consult with her she made me feel comfortable and beautiful. She was on time and stayed for touch ups. My day was absolute perfection and I felt incredibly confident walking down that aisle. She was also able to deal with my wedding party and keep everyone with all their “different” styles happy. I would definitely recommend her.

Natale is an absolute gem! I reached out to her and booked her hair and makeup services as a gift to my sister in law who was getting married at the time. Natale is such a warm, lo...

vely person and it felt like we’d known each other forever! She provided excellent feedback and gave insightful suggestions on what makeup and hair styles would suit my sister in law and the bridal party best. We were all different ages, so it was amazing to have an artist who knew how to bring out the individual beauty of each of our skin types and styles. She is professional, thoughtful and funny!!! I would definitely book with her again in the future. You won’t regret including her as such a special part of any occasion.

Absolutely the worst experience I've ever come across with any business in my life. My wedding is 2 months away, and MONTHS ago we made plans for a trial ( which she never told me...

once i needed to make a deposit in our over 10 conversations) so she can do the makeup for my wedding. I had to reschedule the trial and RE BOOKED a new trial in the same conversation. She just let me know she is now booked for the summer and can no longer help with my wedding since I never put a deposit for our trial!! We had a booked day planned and a conversation saying the day and time and everything was set! Now I am two months away from my wedding with no hair and makeup and months ago when I was trying to find someone everyone was booked and now the chances are great I will no longer be able to get anyone else booked! I am so sad and should have known from all the times she failed to reply to me and would take over a week or more to reply to my messages. The whole experience was SO unprofessional and when I told her how upset I was and how we had this all planned, I texted her "theres a high chance I won't have hair and makeup for my wedding thank you so much" all she wrote me "Lovely. Good luck." Not a nice woman. HIGHLY SUGGEST GOING SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!

Natale was an amazing hair stylist on the day of my wedding. I got married in April 2018. I wasn't able to have a trial before my wedding because we lived on opposite coasts. (I l...

ive in NY but getting married in CA). Her communication prior to the wedding and the day of was fabulous. She did my hair (bride) and a couple of my bridesmaids. Everyone was so happy with the way their hair turned out. She had the best energy and made me feel beautiful. I would recommend her to other brides (or non-brides) looking for hair (or makeup) services.

justments. She arrived early on my wedding day and was a calming presence. Not to mention, my hair and makeup looked wonderful and wore well. I highly recommend Natale for your wedding hair and makeup needs. She won't disappoint.

Natale is a joy to work with - she is very sweet and has great presence. She really knows her stuff with makeup and is very detail-oriented. I loved how my makeup looked on my wedd...

ing day (and at my trial!) - it looked really great in pictures and in-person, and wore beautifully throughout the night. I wore my hair down and with loose curls waves and I ultimately loved how it ended up, though it did take a bit of tweaking. Two of my bridesmaids got their hair done and one got makeup done. Natale really shines as a makeup artist and I am so happy she was part of our big day!

Natale is absolutely hands down the best hair and makeup artist I have ever had. I am a professional actress, so I’ve had my fair share of hair & makeup and Natale exceeded my ex...

pectations! She listened to what I wanted, yet put her own professional and creative twist on top of it, making my look absolutely phenomenal. Plus, she is one of the coolest people you’ll ever meet and makes you feel incredibly comfortable. I could not recommend her more. I’ve since continued using her for special occasions and photo shoots because of her brilliance and expertise. She is my #1 choice. Book her now before she’s already booked!

I booked Natale for my October wedding and was so happy I did. I had more than a dozen in my party and she was able to accommodate and schedule everyone in a very clear and precis...

e timeline. Besides MY hair and make up being in a very natural style, she was able to appropriately add clip in extensions, and apply my make up to last the night. Her execution is above par. I could not have asked for a better stylist the day of my wedding! Thanks Natale.

Natale was fantastic! I had two makeup/hair trials prior to finding Natale on the knot. Disappointed with the trials, I frantically searched the knot and found her. We first met on...

my wedding day but she put me at ease beforehand by spending time to talk about what I wanted and hear more about my vision, wanting to look like myself but my best. On the day of, Natale put me at ease with her calming and positive presence and took great care and detail in making me look my best (and still like myself) for the day of. My girls loved her too. She's truly an artist and I would highly recommend her!

Natale did my bridal hair and make-up and did a fantastic job. She is so easy to communicate with, super friendly, and put me to ease on my wedding day! For my make-up, I asked for...

a natural look and Natale gave me just that -- I still looked like myself, just a more polished and sophisticated version. For my hair, I selected an updo that I'd found from a picture and she was able to completely mirror the look. Plus, she brought me lavender flowers on the day of -- such a sweet gesture! I highly recommend Natale; she's a lovely person to work with and an absolute professional.

I loved working with Natale! I looked and felt amazing on my wedding day, and I really couldn't have asked for more. Despite it being a 100-degree day, the makeup stayed perfectly...

the entire night (in fact, most of the time I didn't even notice that I was wearing any makeup). The photographer also commented that Natale really knew her stuff - that she was able to capture the shadows and highlights on my face such that I would look amazing in pictures (and I did). Natale's prices are very reasonable - I definitely felt that I got a lot of bang for my buck. During the trial, she took time to get to know me, my fiance, and my wedding and understand what kind of makeup I wanted for the big day. Natale did makeup for me (the Bride), my bridesmaids, and my mother; they all looked stunning. It was truly a joy to have Natale as a part of the wedding day.

Natale was amazing. She worked tirelessly and with grounded grace to do the make-up of three women and then my hair and make-up as the bride. She was with us from 10am-4pm and neve...

r stopped working. She even made me a flower crown in ten minutes while I put on my wedding dress. She made the day even more special and I can't imagine going through the prep without her. She also allowed for some quiet and breathing as I was getting ready to get hitched. My three friends who had their make-up done are all from New York and a bit "picky" when it comes to make-up and they all LOVED her. She was patient and encouraging and kind. Everyone looked amazing and I felt prettier than I ever have. If you're having a wedding in Sonoma or in the Bay Area, you should book her ahead of time! She's phenomenal and the best $ I spent for the wedding.

If you're thinking of hiring Natale Verdone, stop thinking and book her immediately! She is a true talent and artist. Natale styled my hair for my wedding in November. I requested ...

retro waves with a deep side part. I had an amazing trial, Natale immediately put me at ease the moment I met her. She patiently listened to all my thoughts. After the trial, I decided I wanted an even more dramatic wave, and she took it upon herself to buy special clips to hold the more dramatic curl. On the wedding day, she was awesome -- great energy, calm and collected working around all the chaos that comes on a wedding day. She made sure I was 100% happy with my look before she left. Thanks to Natale, I felt beautiful and glamorous!! I am so grateful to have found her and I cannot recommend her enough.
