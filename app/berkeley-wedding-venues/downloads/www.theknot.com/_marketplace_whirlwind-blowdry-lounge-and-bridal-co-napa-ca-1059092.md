My wife and I booked Whirlwind for our wedding hair and makeup. Having our hair and makeup done for our wedding was a stress free experience and we looked great thanks to Raquel.

onderfully and in the end my hair and makeup look STUNNING! I got so many compliments. In addition to this, all of my bridal party got hair and makeup done and none complained! They all loved it. The team was organized and asked for hair and makeup samples beforehand so they could ensure they had all the tools and each person was happy. I truly appreciated that and it helped make our special day amazing. I look forward to hopefully working together again soon!

I loved working with Whirlwind Blow Dry Lounge to create my wedding look! I started by only booking makeup services, but later changed my mind and booked hair services as well. The...

y were very flexible with this change and accommodated my request easily. Kylie was my stylist for both hair and makeup, and I couldn't have been happier with her work! Not only did she make me look and feel gorgeous, but she was easy to talk to and made me feel comfortable throughout the entire process. (She was also a total trooper for coming out to my venue at 5:00 am to get me ready for my morning wedding!) I can't recommend Whirlwind Blow Dry Lounge enough, from the ease of working with them to their surprisingly reasonable prices. I would certainly go back to them in the future!

Rachel and her team are wonderful. I truly felt like a beautiful princess on my wedding day thanks to Rachel's awesome touch. My makeup was gorgeous and my hair was just the way I ...

wanted. The best part of it all was her friendly caring, spirit. She had me smiling and joking on my trial day and on my wedding day. She, Crystal and Thomas came to us on the day of and were so wonderful. My mom and aunt had their makeup done by Thomas and looked stunning!! He took his time and did it perfectly. The bridesmaids loved their neat hair by Crystal as well! Accessories were lovely! I have to mention as well that this was a destination wedding and it was so convenient and nice that a lot of our guests were able to schedule blow drys at the salon in downtown Napa. The cutest salon in quaint little shop. I had my hair blown out as well the day before and felt great. I would highly recommend.

my updo, and my bridesmaids hair and makeup looked so natural and glamorous. Even my niece, who is 9, loved her experience! Amy even gave her a little bit of lipgloss and blush, which was a really special touch that she loved! I was really concerned about timing and didn’t want to spend hours and hours getting ready. Everyone was in and out SO quickly, which left ample amount of time for us to sleep in, relax and enjoy the day. I just can’t say enough great things about this wonderful team of stylists- -Thank you SO much!
