For brides-to-be who aren't over-the-top but like a little sparkle, a hidden halo engagement ring is the best of both worlds: It's minimalist upon first glance, but holds a special secret. "Hidden haloes are designed to be hidden from the top of the ring, when you look at it from directly above; they can be seen from the side, or when you tilt the ring," explains Emily Landmade, the bespoke design director at jeweler [Frank Darling](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=9ibcrDa*U1o&mid=48142&u1=Theknot.com-hidden-halo-engagement-rings&murl=https%3A%2F%2Ffrankdarling.com). "They add a bit of secret sparkle that is known to the wearer of the ring. _You_ know it's there, but the general public doesn't see it." Here, we dive into what is a hidden halo engagement ring, what types of stones it works best with and where to find unique styles of this [engagement ring trend](https://www.theknot.com/content/engagement-ring-trends).

## What Is a Hidden Halo Engagement Ring? 

"A hidden halo is a band of delicate pavé set into the basket under the center stone of a ring," Landmade explains. "In a classic setting, the pavé is set into the gallery rail, which is the bar of metal that holds the prongs together." It's important to note the difference between a hidden and traditional [halo engagement ring](https://www.theknot.com/content/halo-engagement-rings). In a traditional halo, which is designed to amp up the sparkle around your center stone, smaller stones surround the center and can be viewed from all angles. The hidden halo, on the other hand, refers to [pavé diamonds](https://www.theknot.com/content/pave-diamond-rings) _underneath_ , rather than around the center stone. While pavé diamonds are the most commonly seen hidden halo gemstone, you could also opt for something more personal: A hidden halo in your partner's birthstone, for example.

## Diamond Shapes for Hidden Halo Engagement Rings

Hidden halo engagement rings can be any size or [diamond shape](https://www.theknot.com/content/brilliant-tips-how-to-choose-a-diamond-shape); the design depends more on the setting than what's on top. An oval engagement ring with a hidden halo is classic with a twist, while a hidden halo radiant engagement ring is a more modern iteration. Cushion cuts are one of the most popular for traditional halo rings, but a cushion-cut hidden halo engagement ring is less common. 

As for the halo gems themselves, those will be round. "Pavé is always set with small round diamonds; think of the metal surface 'paved' with diamonds," Landmade says. "But their shape is so small that it's impossible to see." 

Note that the hidden halo feature is an integral part of the structure and design of a ring; it can't be added on later. "Baskets that have hidden haloes will have a slightly thicker gallery rail to account for the set stones, so these decisions would need to be made when the design is created," Landmade says. 

## Bands for Hidden Halo Engagement Rings 

"Because hidden haloes are set in the basket under the stone, and can't be seen from the top, you can choose any band," Landmade says. "Dress it up with pavé, go all in with an eternity, or keep it sleek and simple with classic solid metal." A pavé band adds a touch of visible sparkle to the engagement ring, but those opting for an engagement ring with a hidden halo typically lean toward something more subtle. In that case, opt for metal; mixed metals are a unique twist, with two different tones between band and basket. We also currently love a wider band with a hidden halo, like this hidden halo [marquise engagement ring](https://plumdiamonds.pxf.io/c/64733/1963708/23974?subId1=Theknot.com-hidden-halo-engagement-rings&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.plumdiamonds.com%2Fproducts%2Fhidden-halo-marquise-engagement-ring-wide-band-yellow-gold) from Plum Diamonds. 

Hidden halos require a gallery rail, though most rings have one (an exception being some bezel-set rings); that's the only real requirement when it comes to band or [engagement ring settings](https://www.theknot.com/content/engagement-ring-settings-101). "Hidden haloes are added to the gallery rail, which is the small band of metal under the girdle of the stone that holds the prongs together securely," Landmade says. "A hidden halo can appear on any setting that has a gallery rail."

## Where to Shop for Hidden Halo Engagement Rings 

While many jewelers can create a [custom engagement ring](https://www.theknot.com/content/custom-engagement-ring-design-101) with a hidden halo (psst, find a jeweler near you in [The Knot Vendor Marketplace](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/jewelers)), a few stand out for having a beautiful selection of engagement rings with a hidden halo already in their repertoire. Here are five favorites. 

[**Frank Darling**](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=9ibcrDa*U1o&mid=48142&u1=Theknot.com-hidden-halo-engagement-rings&murl=https%3A%2F%2Ffrankdarling.com%2Fengagement-rings)**:** This jeweler specializes in custom settings, so customers can work with a designer to create something totally unique, or add a hidden halo to one of the existing setting options. One of FD's signatures is especially unique. "The[ Plunge Hidden Halo](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=9ibcrDa*U1o&mid=48142&u1=Theknot.com-hidden-halo-engagement-rings&murl=https%3A%2F%2Ffrankdarling.com%2Fengagement-rings%2Fplunge-hidden-halo-emerald) is a classic solitaire from the top, but has a much more unique side view," Landmade says. "From the side, you see the dip in the hidden halo that gives the plunge its name and creates a more dramatic silhouette. Combined with the open gallery, which allows the stone to sit lower than it would in a standard engagement setting, this style is a new take on a classic solitaire."

[**Brilliant Earth**](https://brilliantearth.sjv.io/c/64733/1041908/13541?subId1=Theknot.com-hidden-halo-engagement-rings&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brilliantearth.com%2Fengagement-rings%2Fhidden-halo)**:** A search for hidden haloes on Brilliant Earth's site turns up more than 100 results, each more beautiful than the last. Some haloes are directly under the center stone, like in the [Freesia](https://brilliantearth.sjv.io/c/64733/1041908/13541?subId1=Theknot.com-hidden-halo-engagement-rings&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brilliantearth.com%2FFreesia-Hidden-Halo-Diamond-Ring-Gold-BE1D3939-19424930) setting, while others—like the [Secret](https://brilliantearth.sjv.io/c/64733/1041908/13541?subId1=Theknot.com-hidden-halo-engagement-rings&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brilliantearth.com%2FSecret-Halo-1.5mm-Diamond-Ring-Gold-BE1D13065-6495631)— are slightly more prominent, encircling the setting itself on higher-set solitaires. And, with both natural and lab-grown diamonds on offer, shoppers can find something stunning at any price point. 

[**Plum Diamonds**](https://plumdiamonds.pxf.io/c/64733/1963708/23974?subId1=Theknot.com-hidden-halo-engagement-rings&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.plumdiamonds.com%2Fcollections%2Fhidden-halo-engagement-rings): This Chicago-based jeweler is women-owned and operated, and works exclusively with lab-grown diamonds. Its hidden halo selection is large—and fully customizable. Shoppers can choose from options in band width, pavé size, metal color and more and see it digitally rendered right on the site, then spin it around with a 3D viewer (which offers an especially great look at the hidden halo). The hidden halo options include a low basket with minimal halo underneath, a tall V setting with slightly grander hidden halo and, our favorite, pavé prongs, the blingiest take on a hidden halo. 

[**Jean Dousset:**](https://www.pntra.com/t/8-12864-88550-287526?sid=Theknot.com-hidden-halo-engagement-rings&website=177979&url=https%3A%2F%2Fjeandousset.com) Founded by the great-great-grandson of Louis Cartier, this jeweler comes with serious industry chops—and its incredible pieces back them up. Many of Dousset's signature styles include a hidden halo; check out the [Hayden](https://www.pjtra.com/t/8-12864-88550-287526?sid=Theknot.com-hidden-halo-engagement-rings&website=177979&url=https%3A%2F%2Fjeandousset.com%2Fproducts%2Fhayden-round-brilliantsolitaire-lab-diamond-engagement-ring%3Fvariant%3D46121322250495%26), which can be made with stones hidden in the side of its wide band in addition to the hidden halo, making the profile nearly as shiny as the top view. The brand is also known for its less subtle halo options, including the trademarked "Seamless Halo," which appears prongless. 

[**VRAI**](https://vraiandoro.qyov.net/c/64733/615401/10025?subId1=Theknot.com-hidden-halo-engagement-rings&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vrai.com%2Fengagement-rings%2Fhidden-halo-setting%3Fpage%3D1)**:** VRAI has a wide variety of hidden halo designs in its repertoire, including some especially unique ones like this hidden halo pear engagement ring with a [split shank](https://vraiandoro.qyov.net/c/64733/615401/10025?subId1=Theknot.com-hidden-halo-engagement-rings&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vrai.com%2Fengagement-ring%2Ffloating-split-band-ring%2Fpear-yellow-gold-40431341371485) band, and this [double hidden halo](https://vraiandoro.qyov.net/c/64733/615401/10025?subId1=Theknot.com-hidden-halo-engagement-rings&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vrai.com%2Fengagement-ring%2Fregal-pave-dome-ring%2Fround-brilliant-white-gold-43596706152541) engagement ring (which also has a double pavé band, bling bling!). VRAI has seven showrooms across North America (plus a few more worldwide) and offers virtual appointments, so customers can try on the rings in person or talk options with a jeweler before committing to a purchase.
