Danielle was an AMAZING bridal makeup artist. Not only was her work excellent, but she is so lovely to work with as a person, which is extremely important on your wedding day. As I...

’m sure is common, I changed my mind about what I wanted for my makeup at least 3 separate times prior to the wedding day. Danielle was so patient and understanding about my evolving decisions, and we did two trials that really helped everything go perfectly and quickly the first time on the wedding day. Her second artist, Elise, was also fantastic and everyone raved about how good our makeup looked (and LASTED) all day! I also really appreciated how Danielle took lead with organizing everything with our hair stylist, who was also her preferred beauty partner, Netanya Lynn (also amazing!). Overall, I couldn’t recommend Danielle any higher. Every aspect of my experience was exactly what I needed for my wedding. Thanks Danielle! 💖

ter my make up trial with her, I knew she had to be there on my big day. She filled my champagne glass and showed me cat pictures when I started to get stressed. My make up stayed flawless all night (which is crazy because I'm a sweater!) Super reasonably priced and absolutely worth the money. She will not let you down, 10/10 would recommend to a friend.

I hired Danielle back in 2020 for my wedding after doing a makeup trial with her. Although I didn't actually get to use her on my wedding day, I still wanted to leave a review for ...

her because she is such a great person and is very professional. She couldn't work on my wedding because she was sick with Covid that week, but she was very upfront about it and called me as soon as she suspected that she was sick. We came to an arrangement that worked out really well on my wedding day and she was very apologetic about not being able to be there. I really enjoyed working with her during the makeup trial and I know that if she hadn't gotten sick that week, she would have done a great job at my wedding.

I highly recommend Danielle for all your wedding make up and hair needs!! I was not sold on having my makeup done for my wedding, so I waited too long to book someone. Danielle was...

so nice and accommodating when I reached out on the knot website. She held my hand every step of the way, and really respected that I wanted a more natural look since I don’t usually wear make up. Danielle was so kind and respectful and fun to work with. She did an AMAZING job on my hair and makeup. It was exactly what I wanted (even tho I didn’t really know what I wanted when we started). She is extremely talented and I’m soooooo glad I found her. She made me look perfect and beautiful on my wedding day! Thank you Danielle!

I can’t recommend Danielle enough! She was so patient through booking, sharing inspiration photos and on the day. I don’t typically wear make up so I don’t know exactly what I like...

but Danielle went slow and checked in with me the whole way through. She did the same with my mom, taking in both our inputs and making her own suggestions as well. Danielle even did both our hair with plenty of time to spare. I got SO many compliments on both my hair and make up on the day and I tell everyone it’s all due to her skills. Lastly, I was so nervous all morning long and Danielle was there to be a huge support system. You seriously need her on your vendor team for your special day!

wanted the most minimal look. They nailed every single vision. These two were timely, understanding to different wants and were beyond talented with their work. I would highly recommend using them if you are in the Bay Area.

Look. No. Further. Danielle is the epitome of professionalism, poise, and presentation, and she wraps it all up in her kit of magic to make you picture perfect! My best friend’...

s wedding couldn’t have been what it was without Danielle and her glamtastic skills. She brought everything she needed TO US for convenience, she came early, and she made us look beautiful. Our full beat lasted all day AND night, and the photos couldn’t have looked better if they were photoshopped. My best friend is White, I’m Black. Danielle has ALL the colors and knows ALL the necessary secrets to work with ANY body’s skin and skin color. I was shocked when I saw how poppin my melanin was, because everybody can’t do brown girls... but Hella Glam got you, sis!! (Insert claps for emphasis). Danielle made time in the moment for extra faces last minute, but she took her time to beautify just right! The love and passion that Danielle has for detail is unmatched, and unreal! When I think of #HellaGlam I think, HELLA GLAM! Let her let you be your best most beautiful self on your biggest day, it’ll be the best decision you’ll ever make... next to saying “yes” of course. Tip: book the consult appointment so you can tell her what you want, don’t want, like don’t like, and so you’re comfortable and have an idea of the time you’ll need on your big day. If it comes down to makeup or a photographer, book Danielle and take photos with an iPhone. It’s that serious! Congratulations, and I hope you give your big day the love it deserves by choosing Danielle and Hella Glam.

I really loved working with Danielle and I am so glad I found her through the Knot. She is reasonably priced and does great work while really listening to what you want as a bride....

She was super organized throughout the whole process, and after our trial run checked in with me multiple times in the weeks leading up to the wedding. She also coordinated with my hair person on scheduling. This was awesome since it made less work for me! Also on the day of she created a touch up kit including a brand new lip color of the same shade she used on me that day. Danielle really cares about the work she does and seems to care even more about the brides she is working with. I could not recommend her enough and I am really happy with her work!

ing being perfect. The one concern that I did not have was about make artist. My trial had gone flawlessly and Danielle had done exactly what I wanted. I had my trial done before a family party and I received so many compliments on my make up that I was more than confident that on my big day she would do even better. I was not disappointed. Danielle was on time, made sure we were on schedule and kept me calm. My makeup was perfect, exactly what I wanted and my bridesmaid and mom looked amazing. Danielle’s professionalism and attention to detail are like no others. She was fun and enthusiastic and more importantly made me feel amazing. I will be booking her again for other family events!

n smooth day of without any surprises. She made sure I was completely happy with my look. She nailed it first try on the trial alone! Day of, she showed up right on time. She quickly set up and brought everything needed for the day. She did not ask us to provide anything but a chair. Her bubbly and warm personality made everyone comfortable and happy throughout the day. She not only made me feel like the most beautiful woman on my day but she turned all my girls, mother, and grandmother into works of art. I had 13 girls to do the morning of my wedding and she helped me orchestrate a timeline to allow enough time to get everyone done and to our venue in-time without having to rush. She also followed us to the venue to ensure through pictures and travel I always looked my best. Her fun personality and attention to detail made it a true pleasure to work with. I felt truly lucky to have found her to do my wedding as well as my best friends wedding. I plan on using Danielle again for future events or anytime possible as I recommend her to anyone looking for someone she is truly that amazing!
