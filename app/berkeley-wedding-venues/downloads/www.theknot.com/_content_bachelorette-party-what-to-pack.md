## Bachelorette Packing List Items by Category

Before you start tossing things into a suitcase, first take a second to consider a few key details: How long is the trip? Are you flying cross-country or driving a couple of hours away? What's the scenery? Are we talking sapphire beaches, a mountain escape or a city crawl? Your [bachelorette itinerary](https://www.theknot.com/content/bachelorette-itinerary) will shape everything from what shoes to bring to how many outfits you'll realistically need. Here's what to pack for a bachelorette party. 

![Bachelorette party packing list](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/0973a4d4-4172-4946-a0c6-dad0144cab86~rs_768.h)

**Packing list categories:** Outfits | Makeup & Toiletries | Fun Decor & Accessories | Technology

### Outfits 

Your outfits have the most variables and depend entirely on the type of trip. If it's a beach getaway, then you'll want suits, sandals and sun hats. If it's a big city shindig, you'll want some statement looks for party nights, walkable shoes and something for that group brunch. Also, consider the vibe of the destination. Nashville calls for cowboy boots, while a mountain retreat definitely means a flannel something.

## Bachelorette Packing List Essentials to Add to Cart

The above packing list for a bachelorette party should have you and the "I do" crew entirely covered. For some more inspiration on specific products, though, we're sharing some of our favorite items to toss in your weekender or suitcase. From essentials (like travel-sized sunscreen) to just-for-funsies items, these [bachelorette supplies](https://www.theknot.com/content/must-have-bachelorette-party-props) are the little extras that can make your trip smoother, cuter and way more memorable.

### Travel-Sized Facial Sunscreen 

![Travel-Sized Facial Sunscreen](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/f2d6f100-a5e2-44f1-8a8c-544bf9751f07~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.2000.2000)

Sunscreen is a must year-round—rain or shine, mountain or beach, one hour in the sun or an entire day. ISDIN's Fusion Water Magic is super lightweight and comes in a teeny size you can toss in your purse, fanny pack or even pocket. 

[$38 | Sephora](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=9ibcrDa*U1o&mid=2417&u1=TK-bachelorette-party-what-to-pack&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Ffusion-water-magic-spf-40-sunscreen-with-hyaluronic-acid-vitamin-e-P516222)

You'll be a lifesaver (for yourself and the crew) with a portable charger on hand, but not all are created equal. You want to maximize lightness so you don't feel weighed down, while still having a lot of power in the charging bank. Try one of Clutch's super sleek, lightweight chargers. (Make sure to choose the right one for your charging needs.)
