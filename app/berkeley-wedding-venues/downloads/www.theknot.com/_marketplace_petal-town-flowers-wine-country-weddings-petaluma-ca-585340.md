Working with Petal Town Flowers was one of the most positive parts of our wedding planning experience. From our very first email communication, Elizabeth was warm, creative, and in...

credibly attentive to every detail. The floral arrangements were absolutely breathtaking - elegant, fresh, and perfectly tailored to our vision. Elizabeth was a joy to work with - organized, thoughtful, and genuinely invested in making the details of our day perfect. One of the most touching moments was when she helped me surprise my mom with a charm featuring a photo of my Nana, beautifully hung onto my bouquet. It was such a heartfelt gesture that brought tears and smiles, and it meant the world to our family. If you're looking for a florist who brings artistry, care, and personal touches to every arrangement, Petal Town Flowers is the one. We’re so grateful for their role in making our wedding unforgettable!

ugh the whole process, and met with me in their floral workspace to mock-up a sample centerpiece which was fantastic. We discussed a few adjustments, particularly to colors, and boy did they deliver! Watching Martin throw together a mock bouquet in 5 minutes while standing there was amazing - he is so skilled! While flowers are always expensive, they are fairly priced for the service you receive. I would highly recommend them to anyone hosting an event in Sonoma!!

I was blown away by the choice of flowers used and the backdrop was more beautiful than I imagined it would be! Everyone made sure to let me know how amazing the ballroom looked with the white and blush flowers, and my bouquet was perfect - I never did a bouquet toss because I wanted to keep it. You won't be disappointed going with Petal Town, they're awesome!

o our proposal (we decided to put greenery on our sweetheart table as we had less guests than initially expected and I also put flowers in my hair and on our cake). They also delivered the flowers on time and with a lovely presentation. The only issue we had was that some of the bridesmaids bouqs lost a flower or two between the first look/portraits and the ceremony - this may have been due to me using calla lilies and how delicate of flowers they are. However, my aunt happens to be a florist (on the other side of the country) and she was able to reattach 1 of the lost flowers to the 1 bouq and the other one you really didn't notice the missing flower, so still all went very well! My bouq and my bridesmaid's bouq were both absolutely gorgeous! Mine is currently drying, in hopes that I can salvage some of the flowers to save (again, calla lilies don't exactly press well, so trying a different trick). My hair and cake flowers, that I added at the last minute, were lovely and I think my hair especially really would have been missing something without those flowers! All in all, I would recommend Petal Town for brides looking for beautiful (locally purchased) flowers at a reasonable price.

Petal Town Flowers did my daughter Tina's wedding flowers this past fall. They were one of my favorite vendors that we used. Not only were they professional and personable, but th...

e quality of the flowers was stunning. The colors my daughter chose were fall colors, oranges, pale pinks, and greens. The bouquet turned out amazing - so fresh and just beautiful. Since we don't live in the area, we did a lot of the planning over email, and they were very responsive and sent amazing proposals which included photo samples and lots of description. We worked back and forth until we had it just right, then the flowers showed up to the wedding exactly as we had planned. Overall, we had them do the bouquets, corsages, boutonnieres and the centerpieces for the reception. They even let us rent (borrow) the vases from them so we didn't have to find a home for 15 glass vases after the wedding. I would highly recommend Petal Town Flowers to anyone planning a wedding, especially if they don't live in the area and need to work with a reliable florist remotely.

calls so it was kind of last minute I contacted Martin and Elizabeth Ramirez at Petal Town! They saw me very prompt for a meeting and I sat down with Martin and went over ideas that I wanted and liked( showed him some Pinterest stuff) and we thought of an idea!! It all went very smooth and went exactly how I wanted! My wedding was in Sausalito and he even delivered and set up! But two days before the wedding I realized I needed to get the bouquet and boutonnière's and corsages the day before so I called and asked if I could pick those up if they would be ready and it was NO PROBLEM AT ALL and they were perfect and beautiful when we got them on our way out of town and they kept over night perfectly. On the day of the wedding Martin delivered the big pieces and the center piece flowers. I had made my centerpieces before hand and he added the flowers to them. It was PERFECT! The price was right and he did an amazing job. Better than I ever dreamed! I'll always use, and recommend Petal Town for any of my floral needs. Thank you very much Martin and Elizabeth!!!!!

The day of our wedding I thought I knew what to expect, but seeing the flowers for the first time took my breath away. They were stunning, really elegant and so fresh.

Our bouquets were great, but my cousin's bouquet was absolutely stunning. The flowers he used were local and so fresh, and it looked so elegant. He also put flowers on an arch where the ceremony was and it looked like a fairy tale. I would highly recommend this florist. The customer service is great, and his design is such high quality.
