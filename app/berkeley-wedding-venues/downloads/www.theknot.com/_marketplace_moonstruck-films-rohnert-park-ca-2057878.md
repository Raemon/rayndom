Moonstruck films is a dream to work with. From our first video meet and greet with Lenon to our final wedding video being delivered. He was communicative, friendly, patient and so ...

incredibly creative. We absolutely loved working with him. He worked beautifully with our photographer the day of our wedding. After getting used to having a camera around on our wedding day we forgot he was even there! Our friends have all raved about how nice and professional he was. If you’re looking for someone to listen to your vision for your special day and have it come to life Moonstruck films is the way to go! Thank you so much Lenon!

Lenon deliver with excellence and you will not regret receiving your special days memories!

Professionalism aside, which was always present from start to finish, there is more to this company. Something beyond the business end of the production. Faces, words, and moments ...

that you can only capture with careful attention and curation of so many elements that are just a blur for anyone who attends. Before the wedding, Lenon made sure to connect with us a couple times over Zoom to get to know our vision and style. On the day of, he and his assistant were on time at all three of the locations we wanted to capture. They worked seamlessly and almost invisibly throughout the entire day. Everything went off without issue. Microphones, lighting, drones, coordination with other vendors etc. Lenon has the unique ability to stand behind a camera and not just point and shoot but capture the essence of two people and the unique energy of the celebration they have worked so hard to create. It is incredible how after getting to know us for such a short amount of time Moonstruck could produce something that felt so personal to us both. We received our sneak peek video within days of the wedding and our full content within weeks. It was an absolute pleasure to work with Moonstruck and we’d happily recommend them.

It was my dream to have a videographer for our wedding,.. one with a drone. But there was hesitation in adding another cost… is it really necessary ?? I’m here to tell you that it ...

is absolutely worth it! We are so SO glad that we chose Moonstruck Films. Lenon was very engaging and personable from the start. He truly wanted to know our story, so he could create the best product, and the end result was magical. He and Reine were amazing to work with and we felt how much care and thought they put into the entire event. We cannot thank Moonstruck Films enough for capturing our special day so perfectly. You can feel the love and emotion from the day and it brings tears each time we watch it. We highly recommend Moonstruck Films!

als, they are truly artists. From day one, Lenon doubled down on getting to know us as individuals and understanding our vision for the big day so that he could craft a film that truly reflected who we are and everything that made our wedding so special. Lenon is also a master of detail. As the big day approached, he ensured that no detail was overlooked and proactively reached out to our photographer to coordinate. On the day of, Lenon worked so seamlessly that I didn’t even have to think about what to do next or about missing any crucial details – Lenon was 100% on top of it! And the film…oh my goodness, the film!! I truly have no words. My husband and I can’t get through it without it bringing a tear to our eye. It so perfectly captures our day EXACTLY hot we hope to remember it forever. We are well and truly overjoyed and speechless. Thank you Lenon & team for making us a beautiful memory and piece of art that we will treasure forever!

Lenon and his team were AMAZINGGGG! We loved our video so much. We’ve watched it a million times since receiving it. Lenon was so professional and flexible with the whole process. ...

Especially since we ended up delaying our wedding twice and had it 1.5 years after we initially planned. He even moved to NorCal during this time but still stuck with us. He checked in with us every step of the way and was really intentional about getting to know us as a couple which made the whole thing feel very personal and we really appreciated it. The day of and the days leading up to the wedding he was very communicative and great with the timeline. While shooting he was always great with giving us instruction and making sure we felt comfortable and authentic. Overall it was a great experience and we loved the end result! 10/10 highly recommend Lenon and his team!

Where to begin! Lenon and his entire team at Moonstruck Films were absolutely INCREDIBLE for my wedding on 10/23/22 - we hired Lenon about 6 months prior to our wedding date and ev...

erything about the process of working with him was seamless, so easy, reassuring, and wonderful. He was always extremely attentive, never missed a meeting (sorry for being late to a few, Lenon!) and very understanding/accommodating about my schedule. I had no doubt in my mind that he was going to be perfect as he asked us many questions about our style, music preferences, etc. He really got to know us as people/ as a couple which made the design process very intimate with him! The day of the wedding, he and his teams were incredibly professional and gracious with us and were so so sweet. It was such a pleasure having you at our wedding Lenon! We appreciate all of the hard work you put in and made everything so easy for us!!! We got back the sneak peak video and were floored! It was BEAUTIFUL - I have no doubt the final video will be the same and we can’t wait to see it! We can’t thank you enough Lenon!

sionate in what he does. He had very great communication from the time I first reached out to him. He always kept in touch during the process with ideas and even delivered the products quickly. We loved the outcome of his videos- they always came out way better than expected. My husband and I are always in awe wondering "Wow! Lenon is awesome!" So true. He's so awesome at what he does. In every video he had to do for us, you can tell he was very organized and paid attention to what we wanted in the videos. He was right on time for our wedding timeline and respected the timeline of the wedding day since we had a tight schedule. On top of that, his personality and character made him very easy and fun to work with. Loved his work and highly recommend him to anyone for any videos!

even tell that they were there. The quality of work has also been one of the best I’ve ever seen. 100% better than most wedding videographers nowadays. Moonstruck films actually cares about their quality of work and it shows. For the price and the quality of work that they produce, you can’t get a better deal as well. 10/10 would recommend them to anyone who needs a videographer.

Lenon and his team were so kind, professional and thorough in creating an absolutely beautiful wedding film for us which we will treasure our entire lives. We are so grateful for t...

he way they used the beauty of the venue, music and voice-over to create our wedding video. Lenon and his partner even traveled all the way from LA to Malibu on a day about one month before our wedding to record video and audio of my husband and I sharing our story and our thoughts of each other which they then used in our wedding video. It was so thoughtfully planned and incorporated into the wedding video and we appreciated the extra effort. They kindly accommodated our requests to have a full ceremony video, a 3-5 minute highlight video, video of the speeches and dances for an affordable price. We received all of our videos on a beautiful wooden USB drive in the time period we requested after the wedding. Lenon was very prompt in all of our interactions and listened well to all of our requests. The videos were exactly what we hoped for and we highly recommend NVRLESS films for any wedding

d our event. Lenon shot our wedding, for a marathon 14 hour, producing an extraordinary video that we will cherish for a lifetime. Not only did he film our wedding, but he managed to capture our unique personalities and US as a couple. Family and friends have watched our video and absolutely LOVE it, and have nothing but amazing responses. More importantly, our friends that were not able to make it to the wedding, felt like they were there there with us just by watching this epic creation. I highly recommend Moonstruck Films as a videographer and hope you do the same.
