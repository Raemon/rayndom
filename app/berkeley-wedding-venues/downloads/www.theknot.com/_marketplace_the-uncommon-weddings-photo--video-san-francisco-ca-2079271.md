Sway Garcia

Founder

I founded The Uncommon Weddings as a way to be able to share my passion with others. One of the greatest opportunities we get is to tell the story of two people, beginning their journey together. Weddings are more than just two people getting married, there is a unique story behind every couple. My main priority, more than just delivering high-quality video and photo, is your EXPERIENCE. Furthermore, no two weddings are the same and your story is unique. We want to help you tell your story so that you can remember your special day for years to come.

r questions and reached out to us in a timely manner prior to our wedding date to ensure that we were in touch with the photographer and videographer of the day. Our team of photographers & videographers were rockstars the day of the wedding. We got our photos and videos back in time for the holiday season, and our guests were raving about the pictures we used for our newlywed holiday cards! Our package also included a video book which I never knew was a thing until we received ours!

We got a very full and fantastic package we are thrilled with! My husband can’t stop talking about how happy he is with them! We were quoted a town around time but they were delivered a few weeks early and I am so happy about it! The whole team, including the photographers and videographers were so easy to work with it made everything very easy, which is needed on such a big day! We got married at Saratoga Springs and it was absolutely MAGICAL! The photos we got were beyond amazing! Highly recommend!!!

We used Uncommon Weddings for our wedding this past summer in San Francisco and we could not be happier with our choice. We had a small ceremony on a Friday and then a multi-venue ...

wedding on the following Saturday and we had uncommon videographers for each event. For both days, they were easily some of the most professional and easy to work with vendors of the entire day. We coordinated with Sway before the event and he was very communicative and receptive to any ideas or desires that we had. The pricing was also very upfront and understandable on their website and there were no surprise fees or gotchas. The videographers worked fantastically with our photographers and our wedding coordinator and were always in the right position to capture the moments that we had highlighted to them. They also provided subtle mics to use during all of our speeches. The videos themselves were beautiful and the turnaround time and digital delivery mechanism were also great. We don't have any complaints and can't recommend Uncommon Weddings highly enough!

raphy with video as well. Sway was very communicative from start-to-finish, and made us feel at ease from one of our initial conversations. During our day, Cliff was our videographer - he captured all of our heartfelt and humorous moments. Cliff did a great job navigating our physical spaces and ensuring that he and our photographer were always in synergy. The video and highlight reels we received were evident of how much time the team spent editing and curating the content. Watching it for the first time made us very emotional, along with our friends and family that we shared it with. We also received a very cool video book! Thank you Sway, Cliff, and team for ensuring our special day is captured forever!

c wedding planning process. He is very organized, and you can tell his business is structured and organized. His communication and follow-up is consistent but not overbearing. We were on the fence about splurging on a videographer for our wedding; however, in the end, we are incredibly grateful to have the videos he provided to us. Nothing could capture the day better than the videos Sway gave us on the day of the wedding. Sway’s to employees were very personable and great to work with. We hardly knew they were there the day of our event. Overall, the experience working with Sway and his team was great. The Uncommon Weddings package was chose more affordable than a lot of the other quotes we received and the product we got was spectacular. They did a great job with the edits we asked for and were very open to suggestions. I would highly recommend Sway in his team to any of my friends or family members getting married or wanting a special day captured.

mmon Weddings team. As we celebrate our one-year anniversary, we are so grateful that we have these videos to relive our perfect day. The process was smooth, and we couldn't be happier with the end result. They captured our wedding and all the feelings attached to it, and it felt so uniquely ours. Many of our family members cried, laughed, and felt all the emotions again watching the footage. Their prices are so worth the investment. I was appreciative of the honesty with pricing, and the flexibility of what we wanted in our package. There was one tiny miscommunication about what we wanted covered, but they made it right for us with no complications. The videographers on wedding day were so fun and loved how well they worked with our other vendors. When I was researching videographers, I was afraid of getting a "copy+paste" style of wedding videography. I was so impressed that they embraced and captured my family's goofiness, our crazy planned antics, and all the precious moments in between. I highly recommend them to any couple who wants their unique wedding day captured.

hort of exceptional. Firstly, their professionalism and attention to detail were evident from our initial consultation. They took the time to understand our vision and preferences, ensuring that they captured every moment that was important to us. On the day of the wedding, the videographer seamlessly blended into the background, capturing candid moments and genuine emotions without ever feeling intrusive. They worked tirelessly to ensure they didn't miss a single moment, yet they did so with a calm demeanor that helped alleviate any wedding day jitters. The final product was beyond our expectations. The editing was impeccable, creating a beautifully crafted film that perfectly encapsulated the essence of our day. The attention to detail, choice of music, and storytelling were all spot on, leaving us with a timeless keepsake that we'll cherish for years to come. Overall, I can't recommend The Uncommon Weddings videographer highly enough. Their talent, professionalism, and dedication to their craft truly set them apart. If you're looking for a videographer who will capture your wedding day memories in a unique and unforgettable way, look no further than The Uncommon Weddings.

We knew we wanted to hire a videographer at the start of wedding planning. It was really difficult to find one that understood our vision - until we talked to Sway at The Uncommon ...

Weddings. First, Sway is one of the nicest, most genuine people ever. We immediately felt comfortable that our day would be important to them and would be captured how we wanted it to be. We wanted to be able to look back on our videos and see our bridal party making toasts, our guests dancing, our parents and grandparents having fun during the most important day of our lives. And that’s exactly what we got. We had our videos returned right at the 3 month post event mark which is the timeline they prepared us for. On the day of, our videographers were fantastic! They made sure to get all the important events captured along. They danced with us, cried with us and bonded with us so quickly. They were absolutely a wonderful addition to our special day. I have been recommending The Uncommon Weddings to all of my friends and family who are looking for a videographer!! Please invest in this service - it’s so special to be able to look back on your wedding day for years to come! Thank you, thank you, thank you Sway!! We are so happy!

Where to begin? Sway and his team are TOP NOTCH! They were one of the very first vendors we booked at around the 11-month mark from our wedding date. We got married in September of...

2023\. The communication from Sway and his team was incredible from the start. All of our questions were answered promptly and we felt like we were in good hands from the moment we had our first consultation. On our wedding day, two videographers were present and did around 8 hours of coverage, I believe. They made it incredibly easy for us to add an extra hour in order to make sure we had everything covered. The two videographers assigned to us were amazing! Cesar was our lead videographer and his communication skills were wonderful from the moment he was assigned to our wedding and all throughout our special day. Both videographers were friendly, fun and easy-going with the perfect amount of guidance to keep us on track and ensure we got all the shots we had requested (there were SEVERAL). They made us feel so comfortable and catered to our every request! We just received the footage from our wedding and it's everything we could've dreamed of and MORE. To say I cry every time I watch it, is not a lie! We have had so many people approach us who've seen the video from our social media posts and have flat out told us it looks like footage from a movie. We've received so many compliments and a huge part of why everything looks so beautiful is a direct result of the talent of the videographers, Sway and the rest of the team. IF you're on the fence about hiring a videographer, don't be! We specifically splurged on Photography & Videography and cut our budget elsewhere to ensure we had great footage to look back on indefinitely and we are SO glad we did. Hiring The Uncommon Weddings was one of our greatest decisions and we are so thankful to have this beautiful footage to reminisce on the most perfect day of our lives for many years to come. They captured our love, the love & support from our family and friends and the magic of our wedding day so perfectly that it almost seemed effortless. But we know they put a tremendous amount of hard work in to create what we feel is a work of art! Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for making our wedding videography dreams come true. We are forever grateful for you all! xo The Hamiltons
