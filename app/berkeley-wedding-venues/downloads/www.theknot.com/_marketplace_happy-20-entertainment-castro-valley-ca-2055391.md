Arnaldo Lizarraga (DJ Happy)

Owner

At the age of 17, I began my DJ career by doing house parties and other small events, while also maintaining his academics. Later, I entered the night club scenes playing tropical beats in known Bay Area clubs. I also played on La Kalle 105.7 (Radio Station). Now, I have 20 years of experience under my belt. I am a happy Husband and father.

ormation about our wedding day timeline so that he knew exactly what the day looked like. He also pivoted to my random taste in music seamlessly! All our guests couldn’t stop raving about how great he was. He made time to meet with us via Zoom multiple times to discuss our wedding day. We didn’t have a coordinator so he gave us valuable insight, based on his many years of experience. Thank again Arnaldo for making our wedding day extra special!

Let me start by saying, “Thank you, DJ Happy!” DJ Happy was our DJ for our wedding. DJ Happy was helpful and understanding throughout the planning process. We had a few meetings wi...

th DJ Happy and I loved how he explained every option to us. On the day of the wedding, we had a few changes to make to the playlist and he helped fix it quickly. DJ Happy did such an amazing job, from start to finish. The transitions and MCing throughout the night were perfect and DJ Happy never missed a beat. Phenomenal job DJ Happy did! DJ Happy can get anyone up on the dance floor, he even got my grandparents up for a few songs. I would recommend DJ Happy to be your DJ at your next event. We got a photo booth through DJ Happy and it was a hit at our wedding everyone loved our photo booth. I would recommend getting the photo booth, your guests will love it. Thank you again DJ Happy for being part of our wedding day and making it unforgettable.

nicate with AJ during the whole experience. He was always excited to hear us out and helped us plan out the wedding of our dreams. We really liked how technological and professional he was in sculpting the night, particularly how easy it was to upload our plalylists on the app he had us use. AJ knows how to read the audience well and kept them dancing all night. We highly recommend you hire him for your event!

We are SO grateful for DJ Happy! I was initially nervous about hiring a DJ because we weren't sure who would be able to seamlessly mesh our Mexican and American cultures. DJ Happy ...

did just that for us and our guests. We have gotten so many compliments and comments from our guests of all ages about how much fun they had! Arnaldo really captured what we talked about in our meetings and guided us as through the planning process--he uses an app that helps breakdown different music needed for a wedding. Additionally, he offers a QR code so guests can request songs! We couldn't have asked for a better experience hiring a DJ. He's professional, punctual, and knows how to read the crowd! I am definitely booking again for future DJ needs :)

Thank you so much for sharing your wonderful experience with me! I'm thrilled to hear that...

I exceeded your expectations and seamlessly blended your Mexican and American cultures at your wedding. It's completely understandable to feel nervous about finding the right DJ for such an important event, but it's fantastic that I was able to create an atmosphere that everyone enjoyed. I'm delighted to hear that your guests of all ages had a great time and that you received numerous compliments and comments about the fun they had. The use of an app to organize the different music needed for a wedding is a smart and efficient approach. The addition of a QR code for song requests is a thoughtful touch, ensuring that your guests could actively participate in the music selection and further enhancing their experience. I appreciate your kind words and are thrilled to hear that you had such a positive experience. Should you require DJ services in the future, it's great to know that you're planning on booking me again. I wish you all the best in your future celebrations!

Dj happy 😃 @ happy 2.0 Entertainment, really his name and company sums it up you will be happy and entertained by the end of your event. He was very professional and kind to all t...

he guests who approached him. He is very up to date with the latest apps and technology like barcode scanning on every table so guests can request songs without getting up from their chair if you get the photoboth you won’t regret it. Honestly that feature was a fan favorite people kept lining up all day and night to take silly and memorable pictures. He also let me know if I needed a photographer he can provide me with one since he has a few friends in the business he partnered up with. It’s all included with the different deal packages he provides. He was the guy on the phone I spoke with the same guy who Dj for me and the only guy I had to deal with throughout the process, so miss communication most likely wouldn’t happen when dealing with the source. Can’t wait to throw another party because I will 100% be calling Happy Entertainment 2.0. I only wish I knew about him so I could have hired him for my wedding
