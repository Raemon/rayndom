My husband and I got married at The Pearl in San Francisco. After extensive research and many video watch parties, we decided to go with byDesign Films because of their attention t...

o detail and ability to capture the best moments of a wedding day. On our wedding day, the BDF team showed up to both of our locations on time without any points of friction. I appreciated how wonderful this team was the day of; it was like they weren't even there then they delivered this phenomenal full-length film. The process after the wedding was very streamlined - we were able to review and collaborate with their team for edits. The editing & collaboration process was done inside a portal tool they shared, in which we could comment directly on the time stamp to create clear communication with the team. In addition to this, Kate, the Director of Client Experience, was super helpful and patient with us. For me, Customer Experience is crucial during the wedding planning process, especially because there are a lot of moving parts that can become very stressful. To have a vendor that is accommodating and responsive is always a win in my book. We would highly recommend BDF for any friend asking for a videographer in the Bay Area!

Unfortunately, I have to recommend that you avoid the added stress of working with ByDesign. While our videographers were wonderful (I believe all videographers are independently ...

contracted through ByDesign) I cannot recommend ByDesign. First, their "client experience" director, our main contact, changed three separate times in the less than a year between us signing and our wedding. After our wedding, we were contacted by yet another person. This is fine, it just makes me wonder about the quality of the company and how frequently their staff turns over. Second, we selected a videographer for our wedding and were confirmed months in advance, and then ByDesign let us know about a month prior to our wedding that this videographer was double booked and they would need to assign a new one. Lastly, It took 6 months (beyond their contracted window) to receive our videos. A few weeks prior to that date, they let us know it would be late and they offered us our raw footage free of charge. We accepted, but ended up have still yet to receive that 2 months later. It has now been over a month since we've received our films - we made some requests for edits, as the highlight film included clips from all speeches except the father of the bride (?!) and the sound in the full length film was all over the place - and they have not been able to provide even an ETA on when they'll be able to get the edited versions back. After a month. Overall, the professionalism just isn't there for this company. You don't need the stress of having to manage vendor disorganization on top of everything else!

sure if we wanted to invest in a videographer but when we got our videos back we were SO happy we did it- soooooo worth it. We were pleasantly surprised by how quickly they were finished too, we also asked for a few tweaks they made for us with no issues. Highly highly recommend! There's a lot of options out there, but do yourself a favor and go with this company, you won't be disappointed.

easy and affordable with many options available. Our videographer did an absolute amazing job on the wedding day it’s like he wasn’t even their, he made it seem so effortless and made it extremely easy. It felt like if he was one of our friends. The shots that they got are stunning and literally take our breath away each and every time we watch it. We went with a short film and literally was everything we would ever and imagine and more. They say that the day will be over before you know it and it is so true. Bydesign film made it so we can relive that day over and over again! I’m telling you they are a must! It literally looks like you are watching a movie . I would say if you are on the fence just do it! I promise you won’t regret it and they are the perfect videographer to make you wedding video dreams come true like they did ours! Would recommend over and over again!

Their films are authentic, beautiful, high quality, and diverse. There are many different packages to choose from to work with your budget and everyone I spoke with from day one of inquiring was kind, approachable and very easy to communicate with. I was a very particular bride, and the videographers and editors delivered actually what I wanted, down the the filter of the highlight film. It is an incredible feeling to relive the best parts of your wedding day over and over again, and thanks to byDesign Films we are able to do just that! We have watched our film many times already, and we only received it about a month ago. Within the first 10 seconds of the clip, I am already tearing up. I highly recommend choosing byDesign Films for our wedding. You will not regret your decision!

The people at byDesign Films really knew how to tell the story of our special weekend and did an unbelievable job of capturing our Indian Wedding. The videographers byDesign hired ...

were very warm and friendly, and made us feel comfortable that they were going to capture our special weekend exactly how we wanted it. Our wedding party mentioned over and over again how impressive the production value of our videography was. The videographers knew exactly how they wanted to shoot our event, and listened to all of our ideas and incorporated what was important us. Our byDesign coordinator, Vanessa Walden, was incredible in making sure that our video turned out exactly how we wanted it. We were stunned by how cinematic and beautiful our highlight film and full-length video were. During the entire process, she kept us in the loop, gave us a vast library of songs to choose from for our films, and most importantly, implemented any changes that we wanted to our films before we shared them with friends and family. Could not have been happier with our decision to have byDesign shoot our wedding!

Planning our wedding we got mixed reviews about hiring a videographer. So glad we decided to hire a videographer and even happier we went with byDesignFilms to capture our special ...

day! Among the vendors we researched and spoke with, they offered everything we were looking for for the most reasonable price. Though we never met in person until the day of the wedding, communication was so simple, easy, and quick. When we finally did meet our videographers the day of the wedding, they were very friendly and again easy to talk to and work with. They worked real well with our photographer which was so important because I know how it can be difficult when the two get in each other’s way. The videos were delivered in a timely manner and were better than we could have hoped for. Though behind the scenes it seemed like a chaotic day, the videos made it seem like everything was effortless and smooth. They captured all of the right moments and we look forward to looking back on this day years from now.

me I watch it. Michael, our videographer did an amazing job capturing the moments that meant the most to us. He did not miss a beat capturing every meaningful event! He also told Savannah our video editor which songs meant something during our wedding day and she used them to create an amazing video. When I first found byDesign Vanessa, was the first person to reach out to me. She really cared about what my vision was for our wedding video and helped make it a reality! She did a wonderful job helping me plan the time line and make sure the video was exactly what I wanted! I was blown away by byDesign and I am so grateful they created such an amazing video for my husband and I to watch over and over again through the years to come! It really takes us back to how perfect our wedding day was! Thank you byDesign!!!!

ByDesign has been great from the start! From our first conversation, we could tell that their team loves what they do and it truly shows in their work. We didn’t want just a recap ...

of our wedding, we wanted an artistic video that captured all the emotion of that day. That is exactly what we got! Brittany was great throughout the entire process. She was super responsive, and kept us updated with the process of our video. They even delivered on some requests we had after the video was made, like adding a shot of our elder grandparents. Thank you, byDesign! We feel so blessed to have been able to work with you, and we are so thrilled with the final product!

Finding a high quality videographer for our wedding was a top priority and we have absolutely 0 regrets choosing to work with ByDesign Films. From the time we reached out to BDF ...

more than a year ago at this point, to months after the wedding when the films were complete, everyone on the team was kind, responsive, helpful and professional. We cannot thank the team and especially Sherri for making this experience such an enjoyable one. I know our asks were extensive and our expectiations were high, but the team was BEYOND patient with us. Our hopes and expectations were fearfully high - I worried that no one would meet them. However, the film the ByDesign Films created not only meets but exceeded our expectations. I cannot put into words how thankful we are that we chose y'all to work with. The videos bring back so many amazing memories and bring tears to my eyes each time I watch them. They are absolutely beautiful. The music, the footage, the editing... its all perfect. I do not understand how the team was able to create a film that so accurately portrayed our love and our wedding day. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for creating such a beautiful keepsake for my husband and me. We will forever be grateful for finding you.

Hands down one of the best decisions we made for our wedding. From the day we were engaged (let’s be honest... prior to that..) we wanted to have a cinematographer at our wedding....

Then we started shopping around and sadly took it out of our budget... then we happened to come across byDesign films (I may or may not have been still dreaming of our wedding video)... After a great email exchange with Zack and with only 3 months to go until our wedding, we found a way to make it work with his help. Once we confirmed, Zack put us in contact with Brittany who was SO AMAZING through the entire process. She emailed us back every time in what felt like mintues and was very communicative and helpful from day one. Fast forward to our perfect wedding day.. this amazing couple (Dakin and Laura) showed up to start filming. They never once made us feel awkward or uncomfortable, everything was so natural and FUN. The worst part about our whole experience was the anticipation waiting for our films to arrive, but even then, they came faster than expected!! Erica did our editing and took everything Laura and Dakin captured, and turned it into everything we dreamed of and more. The little details (like panning over our lost loved ones while the officiant is mentioning those we wish were here with us... or when my husband was talking about my smile in his vows and she put that over footage of me smiling while getting ready) it’s just perfect. It has been so special to be able to share with friends and family who were not able to make the trip; we can’t stop watching it and cannot wait to share with our future generations. In short- choose byDesign, you won’t regret it!!!

e our value, they helped us develop a timeline for the day that ensured all our important moments were included. The company has a graduated payment plan, requiring an initial deposit when the contract is signed and the balance due just prior to the event date. Overall, we had a great experience with each person on our byDesign Films team - they were professional, kind and great to work with. Our project coordinator, Sherri, worked with us throughout the entire process from the time we signed our contract leading up to our big day and after our wedding until video delivery. She was fantastic to work with, always answering our questions quickly, helping us prepare and document the “must have” shots for our Wedding and then guiding us through the video production and editing process after the big day. Once our video was completed, Sherri worked with the editing team to make a few adjustments to our final product to ensure everything was perfect! Our Videographer, Phillip, was fantastic! He arrived early, was very attentive and worked seamlessly with our photographer to get phenomenal footage of our wedding day. He captured all of our “must have” shots, as well as great footage throughout the day. The attention to detail paid off, giving us an amazing wedding video that we will cherish forever. The editing team did an amazing job on our short film. They narrowed about 8 hours of footage down to a series of beautiful moments that show our wedding story. The film truly is a piece of art! We cannot recommend this company enough - you will not be disappointed!
