Alex L.

WPPI Certified professional photographer, Owner

I know we likely haven’t met before, but hopefully, one day soon we will. Here are a few things I would like to share with you about me before we meet. Photography has been my passion from the time my beloved dad bought me my first camera when I was just seven years old. I saw the camera as a source of magic back then and after decades as a professional photographer, I still feel the same way. For me, photography is not just business; it’s a passion that merges my creative passion with my strong desire to see joy in the eyes of my clients as they view the images and videos from their special event.

Nicki

Professional Videographer

Hello everyone! I was blessed to be born in Odessa (Ukraine), one of the most beautiful cities in the world, located on the coast of the Black Sea. Odessa is famous both for its glorious architecture and for its rich history as a multicultural melting pot – now blending Ukrainians, Greeks, Turks, Jews, Russians, Armenians, Italians, Romanians and others who have enriched each other and created a special “nationality” – Odessite! In fact, one of the main reasons I relocated to San Francisco was to live and work in another international city that is a melting pot to so many diverse cultures. As a child, I developed a wide variety of interests, including soccer, gymnastics, yachting, music and photography. Eventually, I began to focus more on jazz drumming and filmography. My passion for film-making has remained constant throughout my entire life. There’s nothing more inspirational and satisfying than taking part in one of the happiest or most memorable occasions in my clients’ lives and then creating a memento that they can cherish and share for the rest of their lives. When I see their smiles at the end of a project, I know I’ve reached my goal!

Alec

Professional Video Journalist

Greetings, to you! I love shooting and editing video just as much as Alex L loves photography. Back in the day, I was a broadcast video news journalist for UCTVN (Ukrainian Capital TV News Channel). Prior to that, I studied video journalism at Kiev State University in the Ukraine, where I graduated with an MA degree. Currently, in addition to the exciting projects I get to do for Alvis Photography & Video, I produce video projects for a number of clients, including San Francisco-based “Royal Weddings.” I’ve also completed numerous video journalism assignments for San Francisco-based RussArt television program as well as New York City-based NTV and RTN (Russian-language television channels). I’m a family-oriented man and my main interests outside of my work are travel, music and sports.

Alex was by far the most friendly and warm photographer that I have ever worked with. From the beginning, he showed a genuine interest in getting to know my Husband, Max and I lead...

ing up to our wedding day in the Bay Area in June of 2022. We live in Brooklyn Ny, and flew in to host our wedding at my in-laws backyard in Danville CA. Ahead of the event, Alex insisted that we meet in person and get to know one another further. It was a delight to have the chance to meet with him ahead of time after setting everything up remotely. Alex also offers videography work and incredibly unique photo albums as part of his wedding package. We admired the way he uses natural light in his portfolio on his website. Finally, we found his rates to be reasonable for the level of work and true love that he puts into each project. Overall we were thrilled to work with him and now we have the final result to enjoy for years to come. A big Thank you goes out to Alex for this labor of love. Our day would not have been the same without you!

Alvis Photography and Video is simply AMAZING. The care and attention extended to my niece’s wedding at the Palace of Fine Arts were beyond our expectations. Alex was such a pro; t...

he initial set of photos he forwarded us yesterday simply breath-taking, as if his heart took a snapshot and froze those special moments for us, knowing all too well that it was not going to happen that way ever again. It’s raw, it’s irretrievable , it’s s perfectly beautiful. Priceless!!!

They were very professional and prompt. They adopted to whatever the situation was to get the right pictures. My pictures came out gorgeous and I would use them again.
