This review is a mixed bag. First, in the "pro" column: Helen Miller has many beautiful designs in her shop. Because she designs the dresses herself and has them made to order, she...

allows for customization with no extra charge depending on what you want to do. For instance, I asked for a slightly longer train and buttons all the way down the back of my dress. Helen made the experience of shopping for my dress very enjoyable. I love the dress I picked, and she kindly offered me a slight discount because it was just over the top of my budget. Her dresses are made of high-quality materials and her designs are unique and sophisticated. I also appreciated that she guaranteed the dress would be ready within a fairly narrow time window, as I live out of state and could only pick up the dress when I was in town visiting my parents. On the con side: my experience picking up the dress and getting alterations was less positive. As I said above, I had asked for a slightly longer train on my dress. Over email, Helen recommended adding no more than 10-15 inches to the train so that it would meet my length preference without becoming too heavy. When the dress arrived, I was shocked at how long it was, and expressed my surprise to Irina, Helen's colleague who was helping me that day. Irina said to me, "well you got what you asked for." I was taken aback by her comment and decided I would just have to convince myself to be happy with the train as it was, given that Irina did not seem open to my comments, and I had limited time while visiting my parents to get alterations done. I admit it did not occur to me to measure the train until later, after I had taken the dress home to my state. The train was 40 inches, which was much longer than the 20-25 Helen had recommended. I ended up paying an extra $200 to have another bridal seamstress shorten the train to what it originally should have been. I wrote to Helen to ask her to reimburse me for this cost, as we had an agreement in writing about what the train length should have been. She declined, citing her policy of not being responsible for changes to a dress once it leaves her store. She said she would have shortened the train for free when I picked it up if I had said something then. That may be true, but 1) I had no way of knowing that the alterations would have been free, because no one explained that to me, and 2) I had no reason to distrust that the dress was the length that I had requested, so I figured it was my mistake for ordering a too-long train and I would have to live with it. Overall, I'm disappointed that Helen doesn't stand behind the fidelity of her dresses to her customers' orders. I understand her policy of not paying for changes to dresses outside of the shop if a bride changing her mind or damages the dress - unscrupulous people exist and a dress shop should not be held liable for changes or damage that they did not cause. In my case, I was asking for compensation to return my dress to the state in which it should have originally arrived, and to which we agreed in writing. I wouldn't entirely dissuade a bride from purchasing a dress from Helen, but I would advise caution. Either take your dress elsewhere for alterations (I wasn't thrilled about the quality of my alterations either, but I'm leaving out those details as it's not the focus of this review), or measure and double-check everything when your dress arrives to make sure it lives up to what you ordered

I made an appointment with Helen Miller Bridal after shopping at 6 different bridal salons throughout the Bay Area, trying on 30+ dresses and Pinning hundreds more. I was worried I...

would not be able to find the dress I was imagining. It hasn't been easy as someone who is under 5 feet tall and a plus size to shop for wedding dresses. When I called, I asked if Helen Miller Bridal did custom gowns, which Irina said they absolutely did. She booked me an appointment with the owner and designer herself, Helen Miller. When we arrived for the appointment, I was impressed by the beautiful store and the selections it had. I also was immediately put at ease when I met Helen. She was friendly and sincerely took the time to make sure my family and I felt comfortable. We were the only ones in the store, which allowed us to have Helen's undivided attention. After showing her some pictures of the dress I was imagining, Helen brought out 4 choices that most closely matched my pictures. I also have to say that the materials are incredible, unlike some of the other large manufacturer stores. She then had me try on 2 of the dresses to really understand what the shape looked like on my figure. Once we had the right shape, she started explaining the options of adding sleeves, lace, and embellishment. It was one of the best experiences I have had at a bridal store. Helen's passion for what she does was apparent from the moment I started working with her. Helen helped create my wedding dress and my wife's from scratch. The dresses are absolutely gorgeous and I loved every minute of wearing mine. I also want to note that I was working with a budget that is on the very low end of what gowns at a boutique San Francisco store cost. Helen worked within my budget and was also realistic with me about what I could afford in that price range. I ended up buying my custom gown from Helen Miller Bridal and I am thrilled. I cannot recommend Helen Miller Bridal and working with Helen enough.

I have had 2 previous bridal appointments at David's Bridal and spent hours a day looking at their site and I really was not able to find what I wanted. Wedding dress shopping was ...

getting stressful and really exhausting. I got an email from The Knot that had an ad for Helen Miller Bridal at the bottom and decided to schedule an appointment. When I went up to the desk I was greeted by name which was a pleasant and personal touch. My stylist, Claire, was so friendly and very receptive to what styles I liked and staying within my budget. I met Helen Miller who was also so genuinely nice and made me feel so comfortable trying on her dresses. The dresses are incredibly well made and are all just so beautiful! All the dresses are pretty much customizable and you can really get exactly what you want from your wedding dress. I found my dress here and I could not be happier! I had such a wonderful experience at this bridal shop and I really left like Claire and Helen were a part of my wedding team! Definitely check out this bridal shop!

Helen and her team were everything and more that I could ask for. It was the bridal experience that I had hoped for from the very first appointment when I found my dress up until w...

e picked it up for the big day. The room is what you imagine for a dress fitting out of a movie, a private space for you and your group with a reveal curtain and some sparkling to top it off! Helen suggested dresses I would not have thought of- and ended up finding the ONE after a tearful reveal, which I did not expect from myself. Helen was extremely sweet, detailed and helpful in making the dress exactly the way it should fit. She altered the top so that it was more flattering to my body type and went through countless fittings (which I was happy about!) to ensure that it fit just right. I absolutely adored my dress and it was such a breath of fresh air to get such a specialized and hands-on experience. Her dresses are unique, glamorous and classic, just the right mix of fun and romantic. I would highly recommend a stop here for finding your dream dress!

Oh, how much I wished I would've been the one to get married. Went to Helen Miller Boutique with a friend of mine to help her with her wedding gown and I felt in love not only wit...

h each and every gown but with the salon itself. We were welcomed by Elena herself and then she showed us the dresses helped my friend to find The One and it was the most joyful experience. I'm definitely coming back here for my dress as soon as I'm getting married. Because it is not only the gorgeous design, but overall magical experience that every bride has to receive.

Prior to finding Helen Miller Bridal, I had already visited five other bridal stores and had no luck in finding my Dress. I was tired, discouraged, and hopeless about finding the g...

own of my dreams. I tried to find something unique and good quality. But all stores have mainstream dresses and silhouettes. I saw all these dresses on my friends who have are already married and did not want to have same look. I want to have a dress that is unique and enchanting. One day I was visiting my friend in Presidio Heights and noticed beautiful window display at Helen Miller Boutique. I didn't have an appointment, but Helen welcomed me to check the styles and told me all about her store and her background as well as about her other stores in Europe and Middle East. I was impressed. She is so talented and a very nice person, I felt like I was flying to some magic world of Beauty and Creativity. She is so passionate about bridal gowns. I immediately fell in love with her gowns and wanted to order the dress form her boutique. We set up an appointment and I came later on Sunday with my mom and a best friend to try a some dresses. I've tried 5-7 dresses, all was gorgeous and fit so nicely. Her Dresses have good structure and not flimsy like other dresses I have tried at other places. I could not decide on a dress, I was torn between two high contenders: one had a very nice corset top, but I loved the bottom of the other. When I shared my thoughts with Helen she smiled and told me that she can do anything for her Brides. I ordered a custom Dress that will be made with the top from one dress and bottom of the other one I loved so much. I can't wait to get it. I am SO HAPPY ! It is the best shopping experience in my life. I wish all Brides could have such amazing bridal shopping experience and relief like I did. I feel absolutely assured because I know Helen will take care about my Bridal look. Highly recommended!

I went to Helen Miller on August looking for my wedding dress. I visited several stores before I found Helen Miller Bridal. I am so lucky.I thought that i would never find my Dream...

dress. But, finally, I did. From the beginning, the immediate warm welcome I received was so lovely. The store is very clean and have 2 big spacious fitting room. Very modern and stylish like no other wedding stores. All dresses on the rack are very clean and possible to touch. Helen was in the store personally and spend a lot of time helping in choosing my dress. She is an amazing person. She listened me carefully and understand what exactly I need. She gave me several advices about best models for my body style. She cares about every detail and perfect fit. It was the best shopping experience of my life, i was feeling so special and unique. Can't wait to show my Dream dress to fiance! I didn't end up buying my gown at Helen Miller due to my own budgeting concerns ( I am planning to sell my dress after wedding so I am looking for a wedding dress that can be easily sell online). I really missed their excellent service and just overall that confident you have when you purchase from a place and you know they cares how it turns out for your wedding. The material they use on their wedding gown and the accessories they carries in store are all excellent quality. some are made in Europe, not the mass produce type but every single item has its own characters. Their Wedding veils are really beautiful as well, elegant and most of their style already matches their gown nicely. Overall, I had the best wedding dress experience there and I am confident to recommend their store to my friends.

re, spacious fitting rooms, excellent service. All staff was very kind and listened carefully all my concerns. I am very picky and tried on already 35 different dresses...but unsuccessfully . I though I would never find my dream Dress. At Helen Miller store I tried on 8 dresses and all the time i felt that the staff wanted to help me not just to sell the first dress. They tried to find the best option for me. Finally, we found the Dress!!! . It is amazing! But I wanted to hide my tatoo and dress didnt cover it, so I was not 100% happy. Helen noticed that and offered to do custom details to cover it. It was so great ! I was so happy to hear that! I didnt know that it was possible, non of the stores before offered me that option. No my dress became really the Best DREAM dress! I am so happy! So, I have a custom dress personally from a designer. Helen was very excited and happy to add personal details to my dress and charge just 150 usd for that. Now we are working together on my custom veil matching to the dress. It is such a great experience and a lot of fun ! I will have a unique wedding dress and veil! Thanks all Helen Miller team and Helen for their help and opportunity to enjoy the process of finding dream dress.

Yesterday I visited a wonderful new bridal boutique called Helen Miller Bridal. From the outside the boutique looks amazing, and inside it looks like a treasury of wedding dresses!...

I wanted to try on every dress! I had called and made an appointment the day before. When I arrived, I was greeted by the designer and owner Helen Miller, who is lovely and friendly. Helen spent several hours with me and made sure I found my perfect wedding dress. I used to be scared of bridal shops but I actually had fun at Helen's boutique - it was an amazing experience! My dress (ozon) is very elegant and romantic, the veil is beautiful. The dress emphasizes my figure very well. Thanks a lot to Helen Miller! I highly recommend this boutique. I am very happy and I can’t wait to say I DO!

cult, almost impossible to find right place where I can find European style for my dream wedding dress. Finally I found. Not one, three... Now I have a huge dilemma which one to take. Big selection of everything that you need for your special day. Ladies at the boutique were very friendly, helpful and felt my spoiled fashion taste . They gave to me a glass of champagne which was very very nice of them. So can't wait to come back to this dream place for brides. Thanks again to Helen Miller staff for that my dreams come true.
