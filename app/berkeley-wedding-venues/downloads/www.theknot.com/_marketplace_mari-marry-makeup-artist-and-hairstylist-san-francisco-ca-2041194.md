Nadia Fung

Owner

Hi, I'm Nadia. I study makeup and hairstyling from Hong Kong and America. I like the magic of makeup and love seeing my clients delighted after I complete my work. After I study makeup in Hong Kong in 2014, I continuously take makeup and hairstyling courses to hone my skills with different professional makeup artists and cosmetology academies. My expertise in bridal makeup is the natural beauty style, with its soft, dewy features. My goal is to have all my clients feel satisfied and blessed on their wedding. I want to make their dream day a reality and take upon their makeup responsibilities.

d I kept hearing compliments throughout the day on how beautiful I looked. We had a trial before. She was helpful in sharing recommendations for makeup and hairstyles based on my vision and great tips to prepare leading up to the wedding day. After the trial, I knew she was going to execute my makeup and hair well, and of course she did. On the wedding day, her attention to detail, patience, and friendliness made the getting ready process run so smoothly. My mom and sister also got their makeup and hair done by Nadia, and they loved their styles and were so pleased with how pretty they looked. We finished on time and she even helped us with final touch-ups and a touch-up bag to use throughout the day. She is so talented and professional. I highly recommend her if you are ever in need of any makeup and/or hair services. Thank you so much, Nadia!

g everyone feel comfortable. I kept thinking how lucky I was to have her there. It did not feel like just a vendor but like someone genuinely caring about our day. Working with Nadia to bring our vision to life was amazing. She really listened to what we wanted and helped turn our vague ideas into something beautiful and real. She suggested small details we had not thought of, which made the final look feel effortless and exactly us. I loved how collaborative it felt. I did not feel like I had to compromise and the results were perfect.

My makeup stayed perfect all day through photos, happy tears, and dancing, and my hair held up beautifully too. I got so many compliments and truly felt like the best version of myself. I would highly recommend Nadia to any bride who wants someone talented, kind, and reliable.

As someone who never wears makeup (does Vaseline for chapped lips count?) and whose idea of styling her hair is brushing it after it's air-dried post-shower, hiring a hair and make...

up artist for my wedding was daunting. I wanted to look like me, but still feel special on my wedding day. How to find someone who could find that balance for me when I could barely articulate what that meant? Thankfully Nadia understood with little direction and made me feel so beautiful! She'd ask me questions. To which I'd shrug my shoulders. She'd gently make some suggestions. And then BAM! Perfection. What's more, my wedding was on a beach with the wind blowing fiercely and the first thing my sister in law said to me post-ceremony was, "How is your hair still flawless??" Because of Nadia. Thank you Nadia!

nted to have as natural a look as possible. Nadia listened to my wishes and made me feel absolutely beautiful. I felt like myself and my hair and makeup lasted all night long--through wind, sweaty dancing, and everything in between. She helped me figure out what I wanted to do with my look between my hair and makeup trial and wedding day, even assisting me with what I should communicate to my regular hair stylist to make sure my hair was ready for the updo I chose. Nadia was on time and flexible--I got ready in an Airstream trailer onsite at my venue and she made it all work beautifully. My mom, MIL, and officiant also all loved having their hair done by her. I would absolutely recommend her if you're looking for an incredible experience on your wedding day!

I'm so glad that Nadia was my Hair and Makeup wizard for my wedding day! I am an older bride at 50 (my second and meant-to-be-all-along marriage!), and was a bit self-conscious abo...

ut my skin and my thinning hair! I was looking for someone really knew Asian skin and hair, and who could give me a really natural but improved look that would stay put the whole day/evening, and Nadia worked wonders with my sun spotted skin and gave me honest opinions about how we could and could not use hair extensions (I was able to have the twists and the fat bun I wanted after all!), and I actually did look flawless all night! She was such a great resource for products, too - was able to show me that the extensions I purchased on Amazon were fake (! They advertise real human hair but apparently most are fake!) and had me purchase real human hair at a boutique, turned me on to a great lipstick color for me, and directed me to a lip mask that has cured me of my perpetually dry flaking lips! Do the hair/makeup trial - I was on the fence about it because of the extra cost, but it really did help things go smoother on the day of the wedding because we were able to hone in on exactly what I wanted, and Nadia was great about making sure she was really clear on that. She really cares about doing a good job for her clients - you won't regret hiring her!

She nailed the look I was going for, and knew exactly how to accommodate my skin (which was going bananas from the stress of wedding planning. haha). On the day of my wedding, Nadia and her assistant were so communicative and punctual. They stayed on schedule and we even finished earlier than planned. My hair and makeup was amazing and stayed on the entire night. My girls were also all so happy with their hair and makeup. I highly recommend Nadia!

communicative and responsive, punctual, and skilled in her artistry. She has meticulous attention to detail (e.g., she pointed out to me that one of my double eyelids was slightly higher than the other-- something I had never noticed before-- and used eyelid tape to correct for it, glued individual eyelash segments rather than an entire strip, etc.). She has excellent time management skills and managed to stick to a tight schedule of doing hair and makeup for myself, my two sisters, and mom. I love her natural makeup aesthetic, and she totally nailed the look I was going for! I would absolutely recommend booking Nadia for any special event-- she will enhance your natural beauty and is a joy to work with.

ke myself. I had a hard time looking for a professional who is good with Asian makeup and hair, until I found Nadia! Luckily, Nadia made me feel very comfortable and listened to exactly what I wanted (a natural light and soft wedding look that also looks good in photos). My eyes are super sensitive when it comes to applying makeup but she was patient with me and reassured me that I’ll look amazing. She is so detailed, friendly, and professional. And the most important part, I was nervous when I scheduled with other makeup artists during Covid. I didn’t feel comfortable that their tools and products looked kind of dirty and not clean. But Nadia was totally different, her kit was super organized and clean. She sanitized every single tool after it was used. That took me to a surprise, since the other makeup artist did not clean and sanitize before or after use. I’m so thankful that she made me look so beautiful! I received so many compliments on my photoshoot thanks to Nadia and her team. I’m so glad that I found her and I definitely recommend!
