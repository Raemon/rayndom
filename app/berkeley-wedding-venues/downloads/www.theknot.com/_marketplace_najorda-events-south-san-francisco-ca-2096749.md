### About this vendor

Hi, I'm Tricia Najorda, the owner of Najorda Events! I'm an Event Planner based in South San Francisco, CA, with 8+ years of experience specializing in Weddings & milestone celebrations. I love bringing visions to life and creating seamless, memorable experiences for my clients. Whether it's an intimate gathering or a grand celebration, I focus on the details so you can enjoy every moment. My approach is all about organization, creativity, and making sure your event feels uniquely yours. As a wedding planner, my top priority is always my client. I make it a point to remind them that today is all about them — a day to be celebrated and cherished. My goal is to ensure they feel seen, appreciated, and truly like the guest of honor. From the moment we begin working together, I provide reassurance and support, letting them know that I’m here to take care of them and handle every detail so they can feel completely at ease. I pride myself on maintaining a calm and confident presence, ensuring everything runs smoothly and efficiently. With me in charge, they can trust that the day will unfold exactly as planned — organized, joyful, and stress-free. I'm also bilingual, speaking both English and Tagalog, which allows me to connect more personally with a diverse range of clients and their families. I genuinely love what I do — being a part of such a meaningful celebration, meeting the important people in my couples’ lives, and playing a role in a day they’ll remember forever brings me so much joy. Let's make something unforgettable together!

Where do I even begin?! My husband and I got married in early May 2024 at the Hakone Gardens in Saratoga, and we had the absolute pleasure of having Tricia as our day-of coordinato...

r. Initially, my husband and I were going to coordinate the day ourselves since we were planning for a small, intimate wedding with less than 50 guests. Well, it didn't take us long to figure out that we couldn't be coordinators and the bride and groom all at the same time, so I am glad that we ended up looking for some help, and somehow the stars aligned and I found Tricia and Najorda Events from the Bay Area Brides FB group! Tricia is SO organized, detailed, experienced, chill, friendly, reassuring, and fun! She even caught that our caterer did not give us the amount of cupcakes that was our own catering contract, and that a guest was "stealing" mints and approached me discreetly to tell me (don't worry, that guest had the bride's approval to take the mints lol)! Not only did Tricia have our backs, but she also had our guests' backs. One of our guests accidentally fell and busted their knee on the gravel, and Tricia came running with her first aid kit and patched them up. She also respected our venue's time frame and got all of our guests ready and seated for the ceremony, photos, cocktail hour, and reception hall all on time. At the end of the celebrations, her team packed up all of our stuff and loaded it into our vehicles so that we could have an easy exit - nothing was missing. The day seemed effortless for us, all thanks to the huge effort that Tricia and her team put in to make our day even more special. We highly recommend Tricia and Najorda Events for any event planning - you won't regret it!

We were lucky enough to be referred to Tricia by our Matron of Honor who was in another wedding that Tricia had coordinated. Initially I had been going back and forth about having ...

a day-of coordinator because of our budget and my own lack of knowledge of how much this service might cost. Tricia was easy to contact and quickly scheduled a time to hop on a call with us to discuss her services and was even able to work with our budget. Tricia was an absolute pleasure to work with and although she was hired as our day-of coordinator, we felt like we got so much more because Tricia was there for us the whole way. Leading up to our big day, Tricia met with us online for wedding updates, in person to do a venue walk-through together, and was readily available via text or call to answer questions or offer advice. Tricia had many amazing tips and suggestions for the wedding which we appreciated. She also communicated with all our vendors to share our wedding day timeline. The day before the wedding she coordinated a quick and smooth ceremony rehearsal with us and our wedding party. On the day of the wedding, Tricia and her team (Jusann and Sherylley) were absolutely amazing and fit in with our friends and family so well. Many of our guests told us how kind, professional, and fun Tricia and her team were. I will never forget how her kind reminders of: “You’re the guests of honor!” and “I got you!” put us at ease and allowed us to be worry-free on our big day. Tricia executed every detail of our wedding beautifully and truly made our wedding day special. Thank you so much Tricia!

ook the time to understand our vision and brought it to life even better than we imagined. Every detail—from the timeline and vendor coordination to the decor and last-minute changes—was handled with such professionalism and care. I was able to truly relax and enjoy the day, knowing everything was in their capable hands. If you’re looking for someone who is not only skilled and experienced but also kind, calming, and passionate about what they do, Tricia is the one. Thank you for making our big day unforgettable!
