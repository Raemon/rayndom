Monique is a fraud and unreliable. She is also a scam artist. Stay away!

The staff at the salon really tried. I wanted simple, natural, not over-done beauty treatments. I did the "practice" session and really liked the results. However, on the day-of,...

it took a long time to get the makeup right (fortunately I had a good friend to help make sure it was applied symmetrically!). In the end, my makeup turned out well, with some help. My issue was the hair. Given the symmetry challenges with the makeup, we should have thought to double check the bun placement. It was lopsided. And pointy, which was odd. And much more styled/complex (different!) than the practiced version. I know the stylist tried and I really wanted to love it. But it was stressful knowing it wasn't right and because it all took so long, there was no time to fix it. In the grand scheme of things, it all worked out (I kept the veil on all night to cover the lop-sidedness) and the stylist was very sweet. I just wish I didn't have to deal with the extra stress.

d until you feel your most beautiful. She listens to your ideas and looks at your inspiration photos and does a great job translating that onto you. She's honest with you as to what looks best on you. She has a calm energy and generally very positive and funny, which is nice to have on a stressful day, such as your wedding day. Unique's other ladies were equally as fabulous and friendly and did an excellent job on my bridesmaids, grandma, and MOB. If I did it all over again, I would hire Unique Salon in a heartbeat.

I worked with Monique, the salon owner, for all of my wedding beauty needs. Monique is AMAZING – so glad that I found her! My sister-in-law recommended her, because I was looking...

for someone local in Sonoma who was willing to travel to our venue and do both my hair and my makeup onsite. Monique did just that – and she did it flawlessly! I saw her in August for my hair and makeup trial, which sealed the deal for me. I didn’t have a real good idea of how I wanted my hair styled, other than that I wanted to showcase my length and thickness. Monique was creative and skillful, and she styled my hair in such a way that it was down in the back, but secured so that it didn’t blow around at my outdoor wedding. After my trial, I decided to come to Monique for a cut and highlight before the wedding – turned out to be a great decision. She gave me a shape cut and the best dye job I’ve ever had in my entire life! Then I went ahead and scheduled my nail appointment with her too – shellac manicure and a pedicure. The nails were pricier than I anticipated, but for the convenience of one stop shopping, it was worth it! Monique uses natural products in her salon, and her airbrush makeup is mineral-based (better for your skin!). I was fearful that I’d end up not looking like myself on my wedding day because I rarely wear makeup in regular day life – I expressed this to Monique, and she kept my makeup very natural looking. She also did a great job with my individual fake eye lashes – they looked so real and natural! My hair, makeup, and nails all photographed BEAUTIFULLY, and most importantly, I felt like myself! Monique is a sweet, genuine, and talented person – I highly recommend her hair and makeup services, whether at the salon or at your venue. There is a travel fee to have a stylist come to your venue (industry norm, I believe), and her prices are middle of the road for bridal hair and makeup – but WELL worth it. You could skip nails and do them someplace that specializes in nails…but Unique Salon is a fabulous choice for hair and makeup – and not just wedding hair, go see Monique for a cut and highlight! She has a tremendous talent, and you will not be disappointed.
