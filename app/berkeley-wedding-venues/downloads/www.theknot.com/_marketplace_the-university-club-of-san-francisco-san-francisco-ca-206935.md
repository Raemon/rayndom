nd opportunity for a grand entrance through their double doors. We also loved that this venue had two grand bars for our guests to enjoy. It is also an indoor venue so we didn't have to stress too much about the weather. Gavin gave us a tour of the venue when we were looking to book and he informed us that the University Club takes a lot of pride in their food service. They did not disappoint! We have had multiple of our guests inform us that we had some of the best food at their wedding compared to the other weddings they had attended. I wanted a venue that was conveniently located for my guests and allowed them an opportunity to travel and enjoy the Bay Area. At the University Club they are surrounded by multiple hotels and transportation making it very easy to travel. They also offer hotel rooms as well where some of my guests stayed. Lastly, many wedding venues we visited had to stop music between 9pm and 10pm. Our party didn't end until 11pm. And again if my guests were still feeling energetic there were multiple opportunities to attend local SF bars in the area.

ire process and were patient with us as we asked many questions to plan our perfect day. Here are some of the reasons why we chose this venue: \- iconic sf location \- views \- staff was incredibly helpful \- able to do a Friday rehearsal for a Saturday wedding which helped keep our wedding schedule efficient vs some venues have weddings on Friday so you have to rehearse on Thursday \- chairs, table, linens, etc included with venue fee \- food was great!! \- venue is beautiful so we didn’t feel like we had to spend as much to beautify \- balcony was a huge draw for us and we had many guests hang out on the balcony throughout the night \- one venue for all events if we wanted but we chose to do the rehearsal dinner at a restaurant nearby -hotel rooms on site but also close to many great hotels

bout how much they liked the food, the views are spectacular, and the price was an incredible value for a venue in San Francisco. The in house coordinator Yvonne goes above and beyond to make sure your reception is everything you wanted and even added on some wonderful touches that just made the whole event over the top. We also worked with a regular vendor at the U Club, DJ Airsun, who was 5 stars as well. I would strongly suggest that you look at the University Club if you are planning a wedding in San Francisco, you will not be disappointed!

We had the most wonderful wedding hosted by the University Club in June of this year. The atmosphere is both sophisticated and welcoming. It’s the perfect setting for a wedding w...

ith cocktail semi-formal, or formal attire. The interior is well decorated with old school college club and sport paraphernalia. It features photos and relics from schools across the country including several from California. Thanks to the awesome atmosphere and decoration, you get plenty of photo opportunities in different nooks and crannies. Our favorite was the library where we took some pre-ceremony shots and signed the marriage license after. The venue shoots great photos in color or black and white. Our wedding was split along two floors - the upper floor featuring a circular bar, a library room, a room with a pool table, and a large room with a fireplace and balcony where we had our ceremony. The lower floor was where dinner was served - and it featured another balcony with wonderful views framing the speeches from our parents and best men. After dinner, we returned to the top floor, which had been transformed into a dance floor. Between songs, the circular bar served drinks, the pool table was outfitted with desserts, and guests could get fresh air and take selfies on the balcony with a lovely backdrop of San Francisco’s skyline. The club’s staff gave great support through the wedding planning process and coordinated the day-of like a ballet troupe. When we were touring venues, Gavin did a great job taking us through the Club, putting us at ease and helping us see the venue’s potential. Once we reserved our date, Gavin, Yvonne, and the rest of the team were excellent communicators and were great guides when figuring out seating and catering. The Club provides catering - and it is excellent. For our options, we went with the New York steak and pan-seared duck breast, along with stuffed acorn squash as a vegan option. Dinner ran extremely smoothly and the staff even accommodated some ad hoc requests, like when our friend requested they send us chicken tenders (the kids meal) as a gag. The bar service was also excellent and speedy. In addition to dinner, the venue provided dessert options. When we brought in donuts from Bob’s donuts, they laid them out alongside their prepared desserts. University Club gave us a great foundation to build our wedding on and we couldn’t be more grateful.

r. Its layout consists of varied rooms and spaces whose use can be customized. This gave guests a comfortable choice for where to enjoy the reception, whether they wanted to join in the dancing, grab a drink or just talk with others. We loved the University Club’s in-house catering. To begin with, their menu has many choices of different kinds of dishes to serve your guests. The menu contains good options for dietary restrictions. We got a chance to taste the food; there the chef was receptive to our preferences.and feedback. Everything we ate on the day of our wedding was thoughtfully served and delicious. Catering/event managers Yvonne and Gavin were very nice to communicate with and responsive to our needs. On the day of, the venue coordinator worked hard to make sure the setup and dinner went smoothly, still handling us with a light touch. We are grateful that the University Club’s staff treated us with respect at every turn and were very accommodating. With so many weddings on their calendar every year, they really know what they’re doing.

unications with Yvonne months in advance. They were responsive and very helpful in providing recommendations. I think that it was worth the expense to have less stress and fewer worries about making things happen according to plan. On the day of our wedding, the staff themselves were seamless and professional. I fully trusted their expertise and never once felt like I had to check the schedule. We never worried about resetting rooms, food setup, tables and chairs, and making sure our guests were taken care of. Thank you for making our day special and less stressful! My one notes is that it is very difficult to bring in your own food vendors. There is no flexibility on bringing in your own dinner caterer, and an extra fee for bringing in any dessert/snack/other food. The food at the UClubSF is also pretty expensive, so please consider this.

We wanted to find a wedding venue that speaks to us, that reflects our personality and is reliable, since we know it’s a memory that would live with us forever. We went around the ...

bay area, explored many venues, and even liked some of them, but when we entered the University club, we knew it was “the” place. With it’s classic and elegant design, it felt very homey for us. The place was perfect for many reasons: it was spacious enough since it had two floors, was in a very nice spot in the city, had a great view of San Francisco, had their own in-house catering which was very important for us, so that we don’t have to worry about the food and drinks logistics. And above all, we felt we were in good hands with the staff. Yvonne went above and beyond to make our dream wedding come true, by helping us with planning, being very responsive and very flexible with the changes in our plans. As we were getting closer to the big day, she was always in touch with us, making sure we figured out all the details and on top of all what needed to be taken care of. We are happy to say that we had a memorable wedding that we were very pleased with and all thanks to Yvonne and the university club staff. The food and drinks were beyond great, everybody loved it, and the quality exceeded a high end restaurant, even by SF standards. The staff helped us with all the extra decoration we got, guiding our guests and vendors and handling any situation that needed attention. All that came at a very reasonable budget, which on a score card, is very hard to beat here in the bay area. To the whole staff, thank you very much, and a special thank you to Yvonne, who we will be forever grateful to for all the great work she did before and during the big day. We are really happy to have the university club as part of our memory for that important day in our life.

Yvonne was a phenomenal partner to help plan and execute our wedding! We got married September 2023 at the University Club and things went flawlessly! She has a keen sense of what ...

is important and what is not. She was easy to communicate with - she was direct and up-front about important things like cost and rules and timelines, which alleviated stress and cut through ambiguity. She worked with our specific requests without any kind of judgment or nudging to increase the cost of the wedding, something inherent to lots of aspects in the wedding industry. Yvonne clearly had a lot of experience with hosting weddings, and was able to manage many little details for us (i.e. how the space should be arranged for dinner, how much time is needed for a speech or first dance, whether our officiant should use a podium or a folder, etc etc etc). When you don't know what you don't know, Yvonne could be relied on. Lastly, Yvonne was really cool so having her around throughout the process was a fun little bonus! The venue itself was absolutely perfect! Really unique and elegant without being pretentious, and was amazing value compared to the many other places we looked. We tried more budget friendly DIY options but found that the services and cost at the University Club were well worth it. The food was phenomenal and drink service was quick and simple. The venue looked beautiful without any decorations, so it was simple to set the place up. Having the ceremony and reception in the same place simplified the logistics of hosting out-of-towners in a crazy city. The reception is intimate but has lots of different gathering places - on the dance floor, in the bar lounge, on the patio, in the pool room - such that everyone can move around and have their own place while it still felt like one big event. I would suggest to the University Club Bar to allow for a private stash of top shelf liquor for the VIP guests upon request, or to pay for, if it is important to them, as some people who like the expensive stuff were not allowed to have it.

Yvonne handled everything with ease and worked so well with our other vendors so our wedding day went flawlessly. Everyone at the University Club is so friendly and accommodating. The head bartender met with me the day before the wedding to make sure everything was perfect and she made sure I had a drink in my hand all night. The front desk staff are so helpful and made our guests feel welcome all weekend. Our guests still talk about the delicious food they had. The appetizers are amazing and the prime rib/salmon station was a huge hit. My personal favorite was the mushroom ravioli, we want to come back just for that ravioli! Everything is made onsite so the food is hot and timed perfectly with the evening. Being a more all inclusive site saved us so much hassle, not needing to worry about rentals and additional vendors showing up on time. Knowing they've done this so many times saved so much anxiety! For being an upscale venue in the heart of San Francisco, they are a very reasonably priced wedding venue, with no hidden fees at the end! Pick the University Club and dazzle your guests with delicious food and stunning views of San Francisco!

We loved our experience getting married at The University Club SF. The venue is beautiful—has historic SF charm and stunning views of downtown—and the venue staff were all amazing....

I have to give a special shout out to Yvonne. She is an absolute pleasure to work with and helped make our big day run smoothly. When issues arose, Yvonne proactively solved for the problems so that I didn’t have to even think about it. She also was extremely thoughtful—helped guide us through the day and even set aside some hors d’œuvres for us to eat since we missed our cocktail hour for photos. Throughout the process, Yvonne was responsive, easy to work with, and hilarious! The food at the venue was also great, and we really appreciated all the beautiful spaces we had access to during our wedding day. My only comment would be that the hotel staff was not the best—often absent, unhelpful, and responsive. I would recommend booking your hotel block at the Stanford Court Hotel across the street. It’s my CB more affordable and the hotel accommodations are more modern. We are still getting great feedback about the wedding and venue, and we are so happy with our choice!

The University Club was a wonderful venue for our wedding due to its amazing staff, unique space and location, and high-quality menu. As many reviewers have rightfully mentioned, Y...

vonne was such a wonderful partner in helping plan and execute our wedding there, and our wedding planning process was comparatively stress-free due in no small part to her. The rest of the staff, such as the office and catering staff, are also super friendly and professional. The space itself very much fits the Nob Hill aesthetic, and has multiple spaces for guests to mingle after dinner, such as the dance floor, bar, and balcony, creating a very dynamic environment. As big eaters, we wanted to ensure our guests left dinner heartily satisfied, and the University Club really knocked it out of the park. We served the rack of lamb and half chicken, and folks still remember and rave about the food. As an all-inclusive venue, the University Club ticked off all of our boxes - space/location, food, and price point - and still managed to surprise us by the high level of coordination and execution by their staff.

We held our daughter’s wedding at The University Club of San Francisco in January 2022. Yvonne was my first contact and remained my greatest support throughout the planning process...

, and during the wedding activities. The venue has an excellent vendor list if needed, but Yvonne and her team helped coordinate, and worked well with, the deejay, florist, and day-of planner that my daughter used from our home town. As the wedding day approached, the pandemic took an upturn and we were in a bit of a panic. But Yvonne and the event staff were there for us to make sure our guests and the wedding party were safe and comfortable. The entire event team was professional and attentive to our needs, and made sure the wedding went off without a hitch. The UClub SF is truly a one-of-a-kind venue with spectacular city views and gorgeous interior architectural details. The layout of the venue’s 3rd and 4th floors provides a seamless and convenient transition from the ceremony to cocktails, on to dinner and, ultimately, to the dancing and desserts without disruptions. The cost of the wedding was surprisingly affordable compared to other venues in San Francisco and the Bay Area, especially for similar locations on Nob Hill and Union Square. All of our guests were impressed with the beautiful interiors, amazing and personable staff, the excellent food, and incredible views. Thanks to The University Club SF, we were able to give our daughter her dream wedding on a reasonable budget. And Yvonne’s event planning experience was key in keeping our event stress free. We couldn’t be happier to recommend such a superb venue for any event.

While there are many beautiful wedding venues in the bay area, there are none quite like The University Club. It was the perfect setting for an elegant wedding that was also a grea...

t party. Our guests raved about the beautiful interior and stunning city views (so many amazing photo moments!). They couldn't believe how good the food was, and even guests with special dietary needs were able to eat their fill without worrying. We chose to have a buffet, but two servers made our plates for us so we could eat right away and frequently checked in on us during the dinner. They were so sincere and wanted to make sure that we had some time to sit back and relax and eat - and it was so appreciated. Yvonne Lau was there with us from the first walk through, to the food tasting, the rehearsal, and then the big day. Throughout the year prior to the wedding I would be bombarding Yvonne with different ideas and questions and she was always so prompt, honest, and helpful with her reply. Not only was she a saving grace to us as the couple, but she assisted our guests as well throughout the wedding ensuring that everyone had a good time and didn't miss our special moments. The bartenders were so professional and fun and seemed really excited to be there celebrating with all of us. I can truly say that everyone at the University Club who worked to make our day so special did a phenomenal job. We are so grateful that we were able to get married at the University Club and will treasure those memories forever.

e staff was absolutely amazing and catered to our every need. When you’re planning a wedding, some things won’t always go as planned, but when you have a support team that helps you fulfill your dreams and wishes, there isn’t a better place we can have hoped to get married at. Although all of the staff is amazing, we do want to call out Yvonne Lau specifically because she was truly an angel sent to us for our special day. When other vendors let things slip, Yvonne was there to help pick up the slack, and she truly made every moment on our wedding day so amazing by supporting us and being there for us. We sorta half chose the venue because of how much we got along with Yvonne, but I can honestly say she was a major part in putting us at ease and bringing our unique wedding to life. 5 stars across the board for Yvonne and The University Club of San Francisco!

than a few said how honored they were to be invited. Really, the view and venue was fantastic the whole time. The guests were STUNNED when they opened the beautiful doors as my husband escorted our daughter to her now husband! Food was outstanding as the other reviews suggest (and our kids are “foodies”). Yvonne was our go to person for anything we needed and she was amazing from start to finish. During a very busy time, it was so reassuring seeing her in the corner of my eye attending to guests as they arrived. All the staff was incredible too. The bartenders, the servers, everyone was so friendly and efficient. Chris, who helped us with the room blocks, was AMAZING. So helpful! Stanley too! Thank you, University Club, for the wedding of our dreams!

I cannot say enough good things about The University Club SF. It blew away my expectations on every level. The venue itself is incredible -- you feel like you are in a rooftop NYC ...

building with skyline views and its one of those places that's beautiful (in an old school classic kind of way) that the decorating basically speaks for itself if you are someone like me who doesn't care much about decorating. The food was amazing, the bar was double amazing (its full service -- I walked in expected basic vodka-cran type of sitch and my friends were there drinking aperol spritz!), and the staff UNREAL. Yvonne was so on top of things and always so helpful. We didn't have a coordinator because we were trying to keep costs lows and between Yvonne and our wonderful DJ (DJ Aaron from DJ Jeremy productions -- highly recommend) we didn't need one. It also was shockingly affordable for the quality. I legit wouldn't care to go someplace fancier like the Fairmont because the University Club had everythign I wanted and more. Few pieces of advice: \-- parking does suck so don't plan on using their parking. the Crocker Garage 1.5 blocks away was legit $12 for the whole day though. Our hair stylist freaked out about having to park a block away but no one else cared. \-- get a hotel block at the Stanford Court across the street vs the UClub itself. UClub great for venue but the hotel is pretty dated. \-- their vendor list is great although gets booked fast so reach out quickly. Esp DJ -- the set up is a little funky since the venue is actaully two floors (thats overall a plus!) but if you used one of their preferred DJs they set it up with zero problems. Overall, I would recommend the University Club again and again. I feel so lucky we were able to have our wedding here.

ion cannot be beat: it is in the heart of the city and the views are spectacular. The venue is clean, comfortable, and old-timey; it has genuine character. The food is excellent, and the quality was exactly the same in the wedding as it was in our tasting (which is impressive, given that we had 108 guests). Yvonne Lau and Jennifer Mitchell are true pros: they know exactly what works in their venue and what does not, but they're also accommodating and want to ensure that you have the best experience possible. This approach was consistent during our 2.5-year experience with them (our wedding was initially March 2020 and was rescheduled to March 2022). They are a kind, well-organized machine.

While there were some hiccups in hotel bookings for my friends and family, the head of bookings, Tenise, was always quick to the issues. Lastly, my husband and I picked this venue for the vibes, the staff, and the views. We didn’t even try the food until 3.5 weeks before the wedding. We figured, wedding food is never really memorable, right? But, wow. Not only were we amazed during tasting, the day-of food was even better! My guests are still raving about the food! No lie. I’d want to run it back, if I could. Extremely glad we went with the University Club + Yvonne!

vonne and the whole UCLUB were EXTREMELY ACCOMMODATING! All the changes went to the new date smoothly and everything leading up to the event was properly adjusted. When 2021 finally came around we were so excited to start the planning process again and with the help of Yvonne and the team it was perfect. The menu tasting was delicious and gave us a full scope of the evenings options. Yvonne provided great suggestions that allowed us to adjust our choices without having to taste them. Yvonne looped in Jennifer to help with additional support and she was a rockstar! She helped with my reception arrangement and all the decor. It was a true blessing to be able to explain my vision to Yvonne and Jennifer and have them bring it to light! The day before I was able to bring and store all my wedding decor, check in was smooth, and the front desk staff was more than helpful when it came to handing out guest bags and providing me places to store additional items. All my guests were in awe at how gorgeous the venue was. They loved the accommodations and the stunning sights nearby! The wedding day came and went in a flash and that is all thanks to the amazing support from Yvonne, Jennifer, and the staff. They guided the ceremony and everyone knew where to be when! When the ceremony was over Jennifer followed my husband and I with our apps from the cocktail service and it was the sweetest thing! Ensuring we ate and were were happy was the venues main priority and I am beyond thankful for that! The dinner and all the late night food was DELICIOUS! My guests raved about the food for days to come and the bar staff was the best! They were fun and on top of it all night. Shoutout to Stanley at the front desk- he helped my sister pull off the most amazing late night surprise ever! She set up our room with a huge rose petal heart and candles and a bottle of champagne. Beyond perfect way to end the wedding night in a romantic way! If this review hasn’t convinced you to have your wedding at the University Club then I don’t know what else to tell you…except that you’re missing out on the BEST venue in the city! Truly magical.

On the big day itself, the process went SO smoothly that I had EXTRA TIME to just hang around with my bridesmaids! Yvonne made sure that my husband and I got a special plate of hor d'oeuvres to make sure we didn't miss appetizers, and she was on point all night to make sure things happened on time. The venue was a HIT with guests! People loved the classic San Francisco elegance of it all, and because the building itself acts as a piece of decor, we were able to do some light decorating and the place really stood out. Overall, we were so glad that we booked the University Club. It was the last venue we visited but we knew almost instantly that it was where we wanted to get married. Also, a bonus: the Tonga Room is RIGHT across the street, which made for a super fun and casual afterparty with the wedding crew!

We’re so glad we decided to have our wedding at the University Club. It was a fantastic experience from start to finish. Here are some reasons why: -The planning and execution went...

really smoothly. Over the year leading up to the event, Yvonne answered our myriad questions and requests via email and during our walk-through and tasting. On the wedding day itself, everything went like clockwork. All the furniture, decorations, and food showed up in all the right places at the right times, and whatever behind-the-scenes machinery made that possible was virtually invisible to us and to the guests. \- The location is superb. It’s close to Union Square, but far enough to feel less urban and to offer some pretty iconic vistas along the adjacent cable car routes. -The views of the city skyline through the massive windows provided a magnificent backdrop to the ceremony, dinner, and reception. It made the whole event feel super open, and it was a special treat for our out-of-town guests. At times, it felt almost as if the dance floor was outside and we were floating among the highrises of FiDi. -The food was terrific. After hors d'oeuvres during the cocktail hour (potstickers strongly recommended!), we had a buffet dinner. Our guests loved everything -- from the salmon and prime rib to the roasted vegetables and cheese tortellini. They plated the appetizers and dinner for us, so we actually got to eat some of the food! -The space is clean, well furnished, and elegantly decorated. Between the main hall/dance floor, the balcony, the game room, the bar, and the library, there are so many great spots for guests to hang out in. Having a variety of areas made the reception especially vibrant and fun, and gave people plenty of options if they wanted to take a break from the dance floor. -Being able to have both the ceremony and reception in the same place, and being able to stay over and get ready in a room at the Club, was very convenient -- it allowed us to focus on the main activities and people of the day rather than worrying about transportation. All that said, there are a couple of areas for improvement: -Some of the guest rooms were outdated. While the beds are comfortable, the rooms can be loud due to cable cars outside or events (like weddings) upstairs -Parking can’t be booked in advance and is first-come-first serve for an additional fee. Every time you want to access your car you need to check out/return a remote-control gate opener. Overall, the pros FAR outweighed the cons. If we could get married (to each other) all over again, we would absolutely choose to do it at the University Club!

The guests were impressed by everything and raved about the classy yet simple appearance of the interior. They were even fighting over the hors d'oeuvres.
