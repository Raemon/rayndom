Making your wedding registry seems simple enough. Create your account on The Knot, add your preferred presents, watch them appear on your doorstep, send out thank-you cards and never visit your registry page again, right? It's the formula most—if not all—couples follow. But what about your registry completion discount?

[READ MORE The Ultimate Wedding Registry Checklist to Follow ](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-registry-checklist-essentials)

We'll say it again for the people in the back: Registering for the [best registry items](https://www.theknot.com/content/best-wedding-registry-ideas) isn't just an essential task on your wedding planning checklist _before_ the wedding. Once you're married, your registry actually changes from a wish list to a shopping list. [The Knot Registry Store](https://www.theknot.com/content/the-knot-registry-placing-an-order) offers a unique, 20% wedding registry completion discount that lets you purchase many remaining gifts on your list at a fraction of the cost—so if you *really* wanted that gourmet pasta maker, you can buy it yourself for less than its original price. Here's [how the registry discount works](https://www.theknot.com/registry/store/static/post-wedding-discount) and why you *need* to take advantage of it.

## What's a Registry Completion Discount? 

A registry completion discount lets couples buy some of the remaining gifts off their registry after the wedding date for a lower price. The exact percentage off varies across retailers, but in regards to your [The Knot registry](https://www.theknot.com/registry/overview), you'll get 20% off leftover items (with the exclusion of a small handful of brands) as well as free shipping and returns—one of the best discounts out there. Other retailers typically have discounts that fall between 10% and 15%.

According to our [registry gift formula](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-many-gifts-to-register-for), we recommend that couples register for twice as many gifts as their guest list size, as this gives loved ones a variety of options at all price points. And while over-registering is the best tactic, that means there will likely be a few gifts left over after the big day. So, if you had your heart set on a few items that didn't get purchased, you can use The Knot's postwedding registry completion discount to buy some (or all!) of your remaining presents. It's valid within six months after your wedding date.

## How to Use the Knot's Registry Completion Discount 

Once your wedding day ends, take some time to relax and soak up that newlywed bliss—but don't forget to set a reminder to treat yourself to a newlywed shopping spree. According to traditional wedding etiquette, guests technically have up until a year after your wedding to send a gift, so we recommend giving it a few weeks to let additional packages roll in before purchasing items for yourself using what we consider to be the best registry completion discount. (But regardless of how slow the gifts are sent, start [sending wedding thank-you notes](https://www.theknot.com/content/a-complete-guide-to-sending-thank-you-notes) early.) Here's how to use our exclusive registry completion discount:

  1. First thing's first, **make sure you have an account set up on The Knot as well as a The Knot registry that includes items from[The Knot Registry Store](https://www.theknot.com/registry/store)**. (It has everything, from classic kitchenwares to travel accessories and even entertaining essentials— you'll complete your [wedding registry checklist](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-registry-checklist-essentials) in no time.)
  2. Ensure all of your desired items are on your registry either on or before your wedding date and c**heck that at least one guest has purchased a gift** from your registry.
  3. Once your wedding date has passed, revisit your registry wish list and **select the TKRS items you'd like to purchase** with a 20% discount to your cart.
  4. Head to your cart to view your items. **You'll see the 20% markdown automatically be applied** to any items that are valid for the wedding registry discount. 
  5. Check out and **mark "get 20% off The Knot" off of your[postwedding to-do list](https://www.theknot.com/content/post-wedding-to-dos)**. Considering our completion discount is one of the highest on the market, this is one of our wedding registry perks you _really_ don't want to miss.



Now, for the fine print: The Knot's registry completion discount is valid for six months after the celebration and includes free shipping and returns. It's important to note that you'll only be able to use the wedding registry discount once within six months of your wedding date. For your discount to be activated, you'll need to set your wedding date in your account settings, add at least one gift to your registry 45 days prior to the date you hope to redeem your discount and have at least one gift purchased by a guest before the wedding. A few exclusions apply, so read up on our [registry completion discount details here](https://gifts.theknot.com/post-wedding-discount).

## Completion Discounts From Our Registry Partners

If you've [registered at multiple stores](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-many-registries-should-you-have), the good news just keeps on coming. As long as a retailer offers a completion discount (and you meet the eligibility criteria), you can claim and use discounts at all the places you've registered. See our list below for wedding registry perks from some of the [most popular places to register](https://www.theknot.com/content/complete-registry-store-guide). 

By the way: You'll need to register directly with each store to avail of their completion discounts. The Knot's 20% completion offer doesn't apply to items added from our [partner store registries](https://www.theknot.com/registry/add-store-registries). And since The Knot is a universal registry (meaning you can add any items from anywhere), there may be some additional discounts and wedding registry benefits cropping up too. 

  * **Amazon:** At 20%, the Amazon registry completion discount for weddings is competitive. You can use it on order totals up to $1,500.
  * **Anthropologie:** The Anthropologie registry completion discount for weddings comes in at 15% and is valid for 90 days.

  * **Sur la Table:** The Sur la Table registry discount is 10%, but they also offer bonus gifts for qualifying couples. 
  * **Target:** The Target registry discount is 15%—you can use it once in store and once online.
