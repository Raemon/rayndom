I got married on 7/7/18 and Daisy and Jim did all of our floral arrangements for the big day. From the get-go Daisy Rose asked me all the right questions, which helped A LOT since ...

I knew nothing about planning a wedding or about flower arrangements. She helped me discover what my personal taste was when I could never put it to words myself! Of all of my vendors, she was by far the most responsive and thorough with her work. I am naturally indecisive, but she was so gracious and helpful after I asked for several edits to our SOW. Being the control freak that I am, I felt uneasy about not to seeing a preview of the flowers ahead of time. However, I was completely overjoyed with the arrangements, flower crowns and boutonnières she put together. My guests loved them too! I knew I wouldn't have to worry about the execution of set up and strike either. I would recommend Daisy Rose Floral Design a hundred times over!

Daisy Rose and her husband are a great team! Daisy was recommended to me by another florist and I am so happy they recommended her. I was looking for a very natural, seasonal loo...

k for our bouquets and flowers and that is exactly what I got. Daisy took a lot of time to understand the look and feel I was going for. She suggested small touches to make our wedding flowers more personal – such as adding kangaroo paw to our bouquets because my husband is from Australia. Throughout the planning, Daisy and Jim were easy to reach and always responded promptly to my emails and questions. We made some changes up to two weeks before the wedding and Daisy made everything happen. We flew in just a couple of days before the wedding and Daisy was very flexible in allowing me to get her the lace wrap for my bouquet just two days before the wedding. It probably put a lot of stress and time pressure on her to get it so late, but you would never know it – she was very accommodating and gracious. Her husband, Jim, delivered the flowers. He was so flexible and willing to do anything we needed. He met us at the hotel where we got ready then drove the flowers a couple of blocks away to a park where we would be taking pictures so that we didn’t have to carry them all that way. He also helped to pin a pendant on to my bouquet last minute (a gift from my MOH in honor of my late father). Whatever we asked or needed, he was more than willing to help. Our centerpieces were a bit unique. We had a rustic, farm-to-table theme and I asked Daisy for natural bittersweet branches just to lay down the length of the table interspersed with votive candles. The result was perfect. She understood exactly what I was going for. Daisy is wonderful and very affordable. I could not have asked for better.
