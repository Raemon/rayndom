From the moment we walked into our venue (prior to reception), Taj was only making sure his gear and speakers were working and they absolutely were! Playing my music, I was ready t...

o dance and it hadn't even started! Sometime during the reception, the A/C at our venue had broke and it was a 100 degree day. Despite that, him and his wife's energy was still so infectious, they kept the dance floor packed with people and all our favorite songs. I don't even think anyone noticed the A/C had broke because I certainly didn't, even when his wife had our venue bring out a big fan. I just thought I was so sweaty and hot because I was having so much fun dancing! Special s/o to his wife, as well, for saving me from a dress malfunction during the dancing! Taj and his team really went above and beyond our expectations. We gave him a list of music we wanted to hear at our wedding and he did what he does best with it and made our night so memorable! And let's not forget, best MC throughout our wedding! He was so funny and energetic the entire time. We continue to hear from our guests how we found him! Our wedding was everything we hoped for and more, largely thanks to Taj and his wife. If you want a DJ who's not just talented but also exceptionally committed to making your special day prefect, look no further. They are absolutely worth it and then some! Thank you both for making our day truly magical!

We were referred to Taj through our venue, Grace Vineyards, and we couldn’t have asked for a better DJ! He brought the perfect energy to our wedding — fun, upbeat, and effortlessly...

cool. You can tell he used to be a club DJ because the music was actually good — not the typical “wedding DJ” vibe everyone braces for. His transitions were seamless, his voice is great, and he kept the dance floor going all night without ever being cheesy or over-the-top. Taj knew how to read the crowd perfectly and made the whole evening flow naturally. One of our favorite moments was when he even jumped in and danced with us to RuPaul — it was such a fun, genuine touch that made the night even more memorable. If you want someone who brings real talent, professionalism, and good vibes, Taj is your guy. We absolutely loved having him as part of our day!

My wife and I recently got married in San Francisco and found DJ Taj on this website. As soon as we started communicating with Taj we knew we picked the right DJ for us. He’s so ea...

sy to work with and wants the best for your special day. The initial meeting and the meeting just a few days before the wedding made us feel confident we were all on the same page. The day of the wedding him and his wife were so nice and professional and our family loved him! We still get compliments to this day how much fun they had at the wedding! If I had another big event or someone was searching for a wedding DJ, I would 10/10 recommend Taj!

Really enjoy having Taj as our DJ. We were stressing as usual, planning the wedding and procrastinating on creating our playlist. He came through with a beautiful blend of all genr...

e of songs and the guests were very pleased. On top of that he was very professional and easy to work with. Him and his wife did great at hyping people up on the dance floor, which we love. I would recommend him for all your special events!

Our friend threw us a surprise anniversary party for our 10th and Taj delivered!! You couldn’t drag us off the floor because the music was consistently great! We left to get a wate...

r and we came right back to the dance floor. A party is only a success if you have a good DJ and we certainly did with Taj. The lighting was great as well. If you have an event or wedding, we highly recommend his services!!

We loved Taj. He's an awesome guy and a great DJ. Professional, organized, fun, friendly, and was super affordable for us which we appreciated! The only thing we felt like could ha...

ve been slightly different was that he didn't play as much reggaeton and EDM as my wife requested. Not the end of the world, we all had a great time and I would definitely recommend him!

I’m pretty sure I started my conversation with Taj with the words, “We need a DJ for my daughter’s wedding in 3 months and we are very boring and don’t like to dance. Can you help ...

us?” His response? No problem. And you know what? It was NO PROBLEM. Taj and his crew were absolutely wonderful through the entire process. Early and frequent conversations helped us communicate through most decisions well ahead of time, even when we didn’t really know what we wanted. On the day of the wedding, I hardly talked to Taj at all - he knew what he needed to do and I was free to do what I wanted to do - enjoy the party! Taj managed the sound for the outside ceremony (including providing two microphones and a stand for the officiant), worked with my Zoom connection for the ceremony, and absolutely brought the party for the indoor reception. The photo booth with the custom balloon arch and background were SO MUCH FUN! They arrived early and set up well in advance of when we needed them and were cautious to safely tape down and store any wires. The value added by the presence of his team was more than I could have ever expected or asked for. Taj’s wife Michelle didn’t sit down the entire event and they are 100% invited to any future party I throw - as guests! The pictures and videos they took are among my favorites so far. I really didn’t think we could pull off the kind of fun wedding reception that I was seeing in Taj’s Instagram Reels, but I have never been so happy to be so wrong. It turns out we DO like to dance, we just needed the right DJ.
