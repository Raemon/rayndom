## What Is a Virtual Engagement Ring Try-On?

A virtual ring try-on is a digital experience that allows you to try on various [engagement ring styles](https://www.theknot.com/content/engagement-ring-advice), settings and stones virtually. Through specialized websites and apps, you can upload a photo of your hand or use a provided hand model to generate a realistic representation of an engagement ring.

Then, using innovative technology, the website or app overlays images of different rings onto either your hand or a model's, allowing you to see them from various angles and perspectives.

You can typically browse through an extensive collection of engagement rings, filtering by style, [ring metal type](https://www.theknot.com/content/engagement-ring-metal-types), [diamond stone shape](https://www.theknot.com/content/brilliant-tips-how-to-choose-a-diamond-shape) and more. Once you've selected a ring, you can visualize it on a hand, make comparisons between different options and even share images or save your favorites for future reference. (Or as a nudge to your SO.) The user interface is designed to provide a realistic representation of the rings, taking into account factors like proportions, scale and lighting.
