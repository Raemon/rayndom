After your officiant announces you and your boo are officially married, you'll need the right wedding recessional song to exit your ceremony that fits the joyous mood. The recessional wedding song is the first thing you'll hear as a married couple. Whether a DJ or [ceremony musician](https://www.theknot.com/content/finding-ceremony-musicians) plays your wedding ceremony exit song, it should be a thoughtful and romantic choice.

As you start making your [wedding ceremony music](https://www.theknot.com/content/ceremony-music-basics) soundtrack, you might wonder, "What is a recessional song?" Simply put, the recessional song is played at the end of the ceremony when the to-be-weds and wedding party walk up the aisle. This isn't the same as the [wedding processional](https://www.theknot.com/content/ceremony-processional-selections), which occurs when the couple and their wedding party walk down the aisle before the ceremony begins.

And remember, there are no steadfast rules when it comes to choosing wedding recessional songs.

Like your songs for [the first dance](https://www.theknot.com/content/classic-first-dance-songs), [the reception exit](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-exit-songs) and even [cutting the cake](https://www.theknot.com/content/best-wedding-cake-cutting-songs), your wedding recessional music should be a sentimental choice you and your partner love.
