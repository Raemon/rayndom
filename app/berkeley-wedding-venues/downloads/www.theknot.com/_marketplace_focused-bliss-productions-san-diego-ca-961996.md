When we were first planning our wedding, the idea of having a videographer was the last thing on our minds. We already had a photographer, and the idea of having another camera rec...

ording us felt like nerve-wracking and an unnecessary expense. With a little more than a month before the wedding, however, we began to realize that we wanted our vows to be captured in a way that photographs alone could not. After just one day of looking for potential videographers and being put off by lack of quality, nickle-and-diming, pushy sales tactics, and overwhelm about the amount of money it would cost to have a film of our ceremony, we found Michael Cerundolo at Focused Bliss Productions. From our very first contact with Michael, we were blown away by his passion for his work, his commitment to quality, and his willingness to give us everything we wanted and nothing we didn’t. Michael made time to get us booked at the best price we had seen and assured us that he would provide us with quality beyond what we had been able to find. And he delivered. Michael was with us every step of the way, going over details for the wedding and assuring us of his ability to handle the unexpected. On the day of the wedding, Michael was warm, friendly, and put us at ease. When the audio set-up at our venue failed to capture our voices as clearly as we had hoped, Michael assured us he would be able to adjust and correct this in post-production. With weddings, little things always go wrong — nothing is ever “perfect.” There is inherent awkwardness, snags, and unexpected variables. However, when Michael delivered our ceremony film just a week after our wedding, our jaws dropped as we realized he had captured all of the beauty of the ceremony and had smoothed out all of the snags. What we were presented with was a priceless memory the way we would want to remember it. Our voices were clear, the music was soft, and our love was captured in a moving picture. Michael, we cannot thank you enough for giving us such a priceless memory to treasure, just the way we had hoped to remember it. And for the person reading this review, if you are on the fence about whether or not videography is worth the expense in a tight wedding budget, know that your wedding day will go by so fast and that Focused Bliss Productions will provide you with a living memory to treasure for the rest of your lives, just the way you want to remember your wedding day.

dibly professional, thoughtful, and detail-oriented. He spent so much time with us before the big day, carefully discussing every detail of what we wanted. It was so clear he genuinely cared about capturing our day exactly as we envisioned it. His planning was meticulous — he had everything mapped out in advance, which made us feel completely confident and at ease going into the wedding. And on the day itself, Michael was just so lovely. Calm, kind, and quietly capturing every special moment. He made us feel totally comfortable in front of the camera, which is not always easy to do! I couldn’t have asked for anyone better. Michael didn’t just film our wedding — he preserved it in a way that we’ll treasure forever. If you’re looking for someone who is not only highly skilled but also a true professional and an absolute joy to work with, Michael is the one.

eginning when I was looking for videographers, he extended his time to talk to me, didn't make me feel pressured to choose him, and was very open answered all the questions I had. Even in the final details meetings leading up the wedding, he was very organized and thorough with the details of our day and was very easy to work and coordinate with the rest our vendors. Michael really has an eye and talent for creating a cinematic film as well! Not only did he create a timeless, romantic video for us to reminisce on of our wedding day, but he was very professional, organized, and fun to work with the day of our wedding. Being filmed all day can feel a bit awkward, but he made me feel very comfortable and excited for whatever I was doing at that time. His positivity and friendliness made me for excited to see what he filmed and saw through his lens. He also made our sneak peak and our full video within such a timely manner, and honestly way sooner than I expected (granted we did get married in the beginning of the year in an off season,) but nonetheless within that timeframe he created a beautiful, classy, amazing video for us to cherish forever. We felt like we were watching a mini movie or trailer of our wedding into the rest of our lives and wanted to keep watching more! Can't say enough good things and praise for Focused Bliss and Michael! So happy and lucky to have found him!

lighting, dramatic, something to remind us of every moment, every highlight of our special day. We had gone through several vendors, and we honestly weren’t that impressed. They’re were maybe 2 or 3 that we liked… but after a couple weeks of researching, and we found Focused Bliss, met with Michael - and we were like “yup! this is the one!” He made our 12 hr wedding day into a 5 min and 33 second cinematic hallmark video of our wedding, and it couldn’t be more perfect. Every frame captured the blissful moments of each second of wonder of our wedding day. You can watch it here: https://vimeo.com/941735493 Michael was quick with his inquiry response, super personable, worked fast and efficient, worked well with our photographers and other vendors! He made us feel at ease and comfortable throughout the whole day. I highly recommend him for anyone looking for a videographer for your event or wedding! The outcome exceeded our expectations

We hired Michael to be our wedding videographer, and he was absolutely amazing! He was extremely professional and nice throughout the whole process, and he delivered the finished ...

videos within just a couple weeks of our wedding. We decided on the Hallmark cinematic film as well as the "Guest Best Wishes" add-on, and both films turned out incredible. One of my wedding guests even brought their personal drone to the event, and Michael reached out to him and ended up using some of his footage in the cinematic film! It was an overall amazing experience, and I highly recommend Focused Bliss for all soon-to-be newly weds.

t any other vendor to capture our wedding day. A few months before our wedding my husband and I were excited to find out that we were pregnant!! So immediately we knew we wanted to have that be a big part of our day. We ended up needing a little bit of help with ideas on how to reveal the gender of our baby during our cake cutting at the reception. Michael had so many awesome ideas and we ended up going with one of his ideas, which made our wedding video that much greater!! It was a perfect day and I am SO happy we went with Michael. I wish we lived closer to San Diego so we could meet up and grab drinks with him! (for a parents night out haha) Definitely use Focused Bliss for your wedding day!

Michael did a fantastic job and it was everything that we had hoped for. With wedding videos now being feature films I was nervous about not enough of our wedding being documented but with Michael's editing skills it all perfectly came together. I was amazed at the sound quality of his mics and the picture quality of our video. He was also incredibly professional and I loved that he came dressed to impress. He arrived on time and immediately got to work. He was kind and courteous to our other vendors as well as helpful. Michael fit in with our friends and family wonderfully like he was just another guest at the wedding. He even sent us a few pictures the next day that he had captured. We luckily were at the slower point of wedding season and we received our wedding video incredibly fast! Michael is incredibly communicative whether it's email, texting, or even phone calls. He would answer all of our questions and helped to make a timeline to fit everything in that was important to us. I would recommend Michael to our family and friends.

My only regret is that we didn't add the drone footage: our venue was beautiful and I know they would have captured it perfectly.

In 2014, our youngest daughter attended her cousin’s wedding and broke down weeping during the father/daughter dance, lamenting, “Because of Parkinson’s, I’ll never be able to danc...

e with my Dad at my wedding.” Friends and family attempted to console her to no avail. But with time, and a combination of both fierce determination and creative problem solving, Tessa proved that to not be the case. Hiring a wheelchair choreographer, she, her Dad, John, and the instructor practiced faithfully together for 6 months. The result? A most memorable dance that left not a dry eye amongst the wedding guests. Prior to the wedding, Tessa and her fiancé, Nick, made an important decision. Instead of going on a honeymoon, they chose to use the money saved to hire a videographer to film the wedding and, in particular, the father/daughter dance. When the Academy of Neurology called for video submissions later that year, documenting people living well with a neurological disorder, Tessa was quick to submit the dance video entitled, “Living with Parkinson’s. My Father Daughter Dance”, which is viewable on YouTube. The videographer hired was none other than Michael Cerundolo of Focused Bliss Productions. Without question, hiring Michael was the best decision ever made. The pleasure and delight my family and, in particular, my husband and I experienced every time we watched the video was worth the cost, delayed honeymoon, and so much more. John passed away last year, and we just held his Celebration of Life. Did we hire Focused Bliss? Absolutely, and we can’t wait to see the finished product, relive the special moments, and share them with those unable to attend. From the bottom of my heart, thank you, Michael for filling ours!!! ♥️

Planning a wedding can be stressful, but Michael made it a joy, was flexible, understanding, responsive, and professional. We received our wedding video so quickly and it perfectly captured our wedding day from beginning to end and all the little moments in-between. I love that Michael is so involved in the entire process and that we got to work with him directly. My husband and I didn’t want to work with a large company where you, as a client, could get lost in the production of it all. We felt comfortable and trusted Michael with our wedding video and the quality and content of our video will forever be timeless. Thank you Michael and Focused Bliss Productions - please hire them, you will have no regrets!!

el worked seamlessly with our photographer and did an excellent job capturing all of our moments while being very subtle. I worried about being on camera all day and feeling like I was being watched but Michael did an impeccable job blending into the background like a guest. I never felt like I had a camera in my face- I can't even begin to express how important that is on your wedding day! Our hallmark film turned out beautifully but we decided 7 months later to add on a longer cinematic film to see more of the day. Michael was kind enough to get on the phone with me again, walk me through the options and incorporate more content I wanted to see. I'd highly recommend Michael and Focused Bliss.

as exactly who we were looking for. From the very start, Michael was amazing. He made sure he worked within our budget and was very transparent on what our plan included and what we could add. Michael was one of the most organized vendors we had for our big day, he was prompt and very transparent, clear and organized throughout the entire process. Michael is also an amazing communicator, he always responded to us in a very timely manner (something we also discovered to be very important). He was amazing day-of and got along with our photographer amazingly (this is so important). Video - Wow… just wow. In a little over four minutes Focused Bliss truly displayed our beautiful day in such an amazing way. When Michael first sent our video (LESS than 3 weeks after our big day!!), I watched it at least 40 times (and yes, I cried multiple times while watching it because that’s how perfect it is). Our video was truly, truly perfect. It displayed exactly what we wanted and I cannot thank Michael enough for all of his hard work. Michael is SO passionate for what he does and that passion can be seen through his work. Thank you Michael for everything – we truly cannot thank you enough for all of your work.
