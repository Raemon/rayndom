President

Hi! I am the Executive Director of Old North Film Company. My love for storytelling began at the ripe age of 5 when I performed in my first theatre production! Growing up with a love of theatric storytelling translated into my love of on-screen storytelling in college when I pursued a BA in Digital Video Production and Theatre Studies. I filmed my first wedding for one of my friends during that time, and I knew immediately that I loved capturing and telling love stories! I should have guessed this is where my career would take me given my obsession with rom-coms and romance novels! Speaking of romance novels, I’m a big Outlander fan, and my husband I even got married at a castle in Scotland! In my free time, you can catch my husband and I obsessing over our mini goldendoodle, Archie, who is the main character in our house. We love exploring places we have not been, like restaurants, cafes, parks, towns and countries! My excessive number of hobbies include horse riding, reading, singing, tap dancing, snowboarding, playing Nintendo switch, quoting movies, and the art of being average at many things.

Lara and Kia were a part of our entire wedding day from getting ready to the opening of the dance floor, and it was worth every penny. They created the most beautiful wedding video, and perfectly captured every part of our wedding day! The edits for our short film were perfect and included every important part and person from our wedding day. We feel so lucky to have worked with the Old North team.

y liked Old North’s work. It was worth every penny. The video is so beautiful and they captured so much incredible footage. I had them there from my first looks through the first hour on the dance floor. I honestly wish I would have had them there through the send off. The memories were amazing and I wish I had them captured. It would have been worth the extra money! Old North went above and beyond with delivering the video. They sent it earlier than expected. And they made any revisions we had quickly. Then, a few months after my wedding, they truly went above and beyond. My grandmother passed away. I knew they had captured some really incredible moments of her at my wedding just months before. And it was some of the last moments of her on camera. I asked Old North how much it would cost to edit it together. And they wrote back within 24 hours with a kind note, but also creating an edit with just my grandmother at no extra charge. The gesture meant so much to me. Like I said, it was worth every penny. And the Grandma Video was so beautiful. It made me cry, as well as my mom, aunt, and brother. I can’t believe how above and beyond Old North went. I would 10/10 recommend.

One of the biggest pieces of wedding advice I received when we first got engaged was "don't skimp on the videographer...you don't think you need one, you do". I will be giving out ...

that advice to future brides and grooms now too because I cannot imagine having my wedding day captured only in still photos and memories. It's one of the biggest days of your life--the chance to relive it in motion is well worth the investment. I was looking through videographer websites and looking at samples of their work and I knew I wanted to hire Old North when I was watching the video of a couple I didn't even know and tearing up. I figured if they could evoke that emotion from me on a sample video, I knew it would be 100x better when it's my own video. We had James as our primary shooter (John was our secondary) and they were both wonderful to work with! They arrived early the day of the wedding and were both professional and prepared. My husband and I are, admittedly, not the most comfortable in front of the camera, so we were a little wary how we would feel with 2 photographers and 2 videographers around us all night, but James and John helped us feel SO comfortable and, once the day got moving, we hardly knew they were there! I've lost track of how many times I've watched our cinematic cut of our wedding day. It made both my husband and I cry being able to see such a beautiful day condensed into a 10 minute film that we can watch over and over again and be able to relive and soak in the memories. Not to mention the multi-view cuts of our first dance, our ceremony, and the speeches. I know it's a splurge, I know you don't think you need it, but hiring Old North was one of the best decisions I made during our wedding planning process. We couldn't be happier or more grateful for their hard work!!

dent that Old North Film Co was the right choice for our wedding. At first, I was unsure if we wanted to do a full video package, but I am SO glad we did! We haven't gotten our final video footage back but we saw a preview and it is absolutely amazing. Reliving our wedding through the "summary" video was such a gift we will treasure for years to come. The editors did such a nice job capturing the energy and love from the day. Larissa, our lead videographer, was great to work with. She was communicative, kind, and easygoing from the beginning. We also had a very large wedding (300+ people) and Larissa and her assistant were able to handle our large guest count / capture a lot of great moments with ease. I cannot wait to see the final version of the video and would highly recommend Old North Film Co. You certainly won't regret hiring them!

I would highly recommend hiring Old North Film Company for your wedding! We were blown away by the cinematic video they put together for us. It was absolutely AMAZING. It was every...

thing I hoped for in our wedding video and MORE. The day was captured so beautifully. They got many different camera shots (including drone footage), the music is wonderful, and they did a fantastic job adding speech voiceovers to the video. The cinematography of the video is entirely beautiful. It has been so special to watch and share with friends and family. Many got emotional watching it, including me and I don’t get emotional easily! One of the aspects I liked about the video is that it wasn’t cheesy. Sometimes you watch cinematic wedding videos that aren’t well done. Old North Film Company did an incredible job putting together a truly breathtaking video. Ahead of the wedding day we filled out a questionnaire and spoke with our lead videographer, Caleb. Through the questionnaire and speaking with Caleb we were able to share our vision for what we wanted captured and what we hoped the cinematic video would be like. There was an example video on their website that we really liked so we said we would like a video that had a similar style. Old North hit our vision out of the ballpark and even exceeded expectations. Throughout the whole process, Old North was great to work with. The day of the wedding we had our lead videographer and also an assistant. They both did an excellent job. For our end product we received a 9 minute cinematic video, the full ceremony, all of the speeches, and all of the dances (father/daughter, mother/groom, and the first dance.) Old North Film Company will allow us to relive our wedding day for the rest of our lives and we are so grateful for the job they did capturing one of the best days of our lives. You will not be disappointed hiring them for your wedding!

James and his partner from Old North Film Co were absolutely wonderful to work with! We were so happy with choosing Old North Film Co to capture our day and had a great experience....

They were organized, efficient, and stayed on time (even came early) given all time restrictions while managing to capture every person and moment we hoped to get! They were professional and worked well with our Catholic church and were respectful of the rules of the church which can be difficult at times. They made us feel so comfortable and got authentic moments of us as well as quality “posed” moments. I loved when Jason got a "good shot" he was excited for us and showed us some cool clips he got in the moment which made me feel so confident they got great footage. They both blended in well with the crowd while dancing and didn’t take us away from enjoying our experience with friends and family. They were very communicative and we cannot wait to see the end product!Their pricing is fair to the professional standard and reflects what we received in terms of pictures and overall experience. I will be recommending Old North Film Co to all my friends and family!

When I think about where to begin, I struggle with the right words to adequately express my gratitude and appreciation for this amazing company. Deciding to hire a video production...

service/ videographer to capture our wedding was a really important decision for us. As the bride, I researched what felt like hundreds of companies to view their work, and find what I was looking for. As soon as I watched a few examples of Old North’s work, I knew I had found the company I wanted to work with. During our consultation meeting, I spoke with Alex, who immediately eased my fears, and took detailed notes about things we knew we wanted. We were happy to find all the packages were completely customizable, so there is likely something for everyone’s budget. Come wedding day, we had the pleasure of working with with both Jesse and John. Jesse was with me(the bridal party) and John stayed with the men. It was amazing seeing them work together, and alongside our photographer. They really are experts at their craft and ensuring they aren’t getting each other's way, and really just were an enjoyable part of the day. My photographer also mentioned that they were extremely professional and were some of the best she has seen in her 15 years of wedding photography. The only, very minimal, but very understandable disappointment was the wait time to receive your wedding video footage. It was right on time with the projected wait time they told us(2-3 months) but it did feel like an eternity when you just want to see it all right away. However, it was beyond worth the wait. Every part of our package is perfect. Our cinematic video made me laugh, and cry. Our families and friends have been in awe of it. We love all of our extra footage, and small moments that were captured too. The video editing team brought my dreams to life. We also worked with David after we received the video package. He was so kind and patient as he ensured we had everything we had hoped for. All in all, I cannot recommend them enough. Each person we worked with is an expert in their area of expertise for the company. Their work speaks for themselves and I encourage all future brides and grooms to consider them.

favorite memories from the night. We interviewed with a few different companies, but Old North was an easy pick! We had a few calls discussing things that were important to us to be captured throughout the day, and it was obvious they listened because everything we discussed was beautifully put together in the video. They worked so well with our photographers as well which made the day so much easier in the hustle of getting photos done. We loved our video so much (originally got the 5 minute video) that I asked for them to make the longer feature-which they did and the turn around time was so quick. No question to go with Old North- communication is quick, concise, and the work they did was amazing- best decision from the big day- and get the longest video-you will not regret it!
