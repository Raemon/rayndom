Our wedding was in Virginia. Our videographer, Jonathan, was professional and meticulous. He paid great attention to our requests and what we wanted for our video. We also had the ...

flexibility to choose a song from a large platform, which made the video feel more personal. As a bonus, Jonathan has an amazing voice and even sang us a song during our karaoke session, which was a fun and memorable touch. One thing to note is that the original package does not include revisions, so a few scenes we felt less satisfied with were included in the final video. Overall, we appreciated Jonathan and the Originals team’s dedication and creativity, and the experience was a positive one.

I would describe our experience with Original Weddings Chicago photography as extremely high-value and a strong contributor to the joy and seamlessness of our wedding day. For our ...

Wisconsin wedding, 7 hours and two photographers (their mid-tier package) was competitively priced and impressively executed; for our event, there could have been no better fit than photography from Original Weddings. From start to finish, our expectations were completely exceeded in every dimension by our assigned photographers, Shawn and Brock, who were easy and fun to work with, captured every moment incredibly, and seamlessly integrated their presence and work into the fabric of our event. They truly made the day about US and our story, and it was such a pleasure to feel in total control yet unstressed and effortlessly supported. They were extremely courteous, knowledgeable, and thorough in their presence and direction throughout the day, and our wedding gallery turned out in the exact style and to the highest caliber we hoped for (and at a price point that was truly ideal for us). The booking process, communication chain, and pre-wedding meeting(s) were among the easiest and most seamless we had with any of our vendors, and we appreciate how comprehensive their services and offerings were while keeping things simple and easy to parse for us as the couple. The number of hours and the level of talent we received from Original Weddings (particularly from Shawn and Brock as our photographers) were nothing short of perfect for us, and there is an excellent chance that it will be perfect for your wedding too. My wife and I are so grateful for every moment we got to work with this company and overjoyed with every result thereof, and if you’re planning your wedding, we encourage you to strongly consider Original Weddings, particularly if you have the chance to work with Shawn and/or Brock as your photographers. ~Stephen & Ciara

with some great candid shots. We chose Original Weddings because we really liked their Instagram photos, and they had pricing options that fit our budget comfortably. Their online platform and regular communication made the process super simple and straightforward. We met with the Original team and our photographer, Eugene, a month or so before the wedding, and gave him pretty much no direction except that we wanted a lot of candid shots. The day of the wedding, he was on point. He got amazing candid shots, but also recommended certain group photos or locations for us to shoot throughout the evening. We are so thrilled with how our photos turned out, and owe it all to Eugene’s guidance, skill, and professionalism.

ght it to life — the drone footage was especially epic! We can’t wait to see the final gallery and relive every moment through their lens. Their style is cinematic yet deeply personal — every frame feels intentional, romantic, and full of movement. Teddy (Lead Photo) and Gabby (Second Photo) captured not just the big moments, but the quiet, emotional ones too, with an eye for light and composition that made everything look editorial-worthy. Jem (Lead Video) and Feddy (Second Video) brought such positive energy to the day — they were everywhere and nowhere all at once, capturing magic without ever interrupting the flow. You could feel their passion in every interaction, and it was contagious. Our other vendors kept commenting on how much they loved working alongside them — they were collaborative, respectful, and made everyone feel like part of the story. We’re so grateful to have had this dream team documenting our day.

ortal answered all our questions and more, and the photographers and videographers were such sensational people to work with on the day of our wedding. The crew that worked our wedding truly went above and beyond to execute our vision, really understood the look we were going for, and were able to add their excellent creativity to the entire process. The photos and videos we received are beyond our wildest imaginations and we are so extremely appreciative that every moment from the day was captured with such flawless execution and attention to detail. We highly recommend the amazing crew at Original Weddings, they made the entire experience so magical and we couldn’t be happier with the outcome. Thank you to all!

I honestly can’t say enough good things about Sound Originals. They shot our wedding and were such a joy to have around the entire day. From the very beginning, they were super fri...

endly and easy to talk to, and they really listened to what we wanted. I had a few specific shots in mind, I had an art piece commissioned and wanted to recreate it and the photographer made sure we were able to. The picture came out stunning! It ended up raining on our wedding day, and I was worried it would prevent us from taking some good pictures, but they totally embraced it and somehow made the rain look magical. The photos turned out so beautiful and natural, and you can tell they genuinely care about what they do. They were a pleasure to work with both day off with the photographer and when I messaged them with any questions or any extras I wanted added. If you’re looking for a photographer who’s not only talented but also kind, patient, and just great to be around, I can’t recommend enough. The pictures came out beautiful and it was so smooth and easy both on my wedding day and any questions I had before and after. I’m so glad I chose them!

The photos are absolutely stunning — timeless, bright, and full of emotion — and the video perfectly brings us back to the best day of our lives every time we watch it. They truly told our story in the most beautiful way. We’ll treasure these memories forever and can’t recommend them enough to anyone looking for an incredible photo and video team!

riginal Weddings truly outdid themselves when it came to capturing our day — both in photo and video form! We opted for two photographers and one videographer, and we couldn’t be h...

appier with the results. We were initially told to expect our photos and videos within 4–6 months, but to our surprise, we received everything in less than two weeks after the wedding! Our lead photographer, Steve (or Steven), was wonderful — full of energy, creative, and so intentional with every shot he took. Aspen, our second photographer, perfectly captured all the little details and candid moments we might have missed. It was such a gift to see the empty room and venue shots that we didn’t get to take in during the day. Our videographer, Wen (apologies if I’ve spelled that incorrectly), was equally amazing. He captured the joy, the laughter, and all the meaningful speeches that we’ll cherish forever. Original Weddings exceeded every expectation, and we highly recommend them. After researching and comparing multiple vendors, we found their pricing and quality to be unmatched. We loved working with them — and if we could re-hire them, we absolutely would!

ke she was part of the party. We really appreciated how Original Weddings worked with us to capture what and who was most important. They were also able to be there for so many more hours than other private contractors and companies. Part of why we ended up going with them was the price for number of hours. I would have loved to really pick and choose, but $1800 for 6 hours of work, photo editing, personalization, planning meeting before the event, and access to all of our photos was such a good deal. Our pictures turned out wonderfully! We are so grateful we were able to find Original Weddings to help memorialize our wedding for years to come. We highly recommend Original Weddings! <3 I normally can't stand candid photos of myself, but she was able to catch beautiful moments.

They were so professional and responsive, such a reasonable price, and we got our content back SO fast!! also- I can’t tell you how many guests comments on how amazing out photographer was and I agree.

We rarely find the time to leave reviews but feel that we have to share what a wonderful experience we had with Original Weddings' services! We booked the Ruby package (2 photograp...

hers & 1 videographer) for 11 hours (very big day with multiple events) in Atlanta. Shout out to our lead photographer Abby, who was PHENOMENAL! Some criteria that we used to narrow down our final choice to capture our special day and how Original Weddings exceeded our expectations: Communication: Very prompt responses from the planning team via the Client Portal, which was easy to navigate. It was so great to have all the messages, questionnaires, and details all in a centralized location given how chaotic wedding planning can get! Professionalism: We cannot rave enough about our photo & video team! They were so fun and hyped us up throughout the day. Our lead photographer Abby was incredibly detail-oriented and provided cheery guidance to make our vision come true! We could tell that the team was on the same page and had spent time looking through our wedding Pinterest board beforehand. Amazing team work! Quality: We just got our photo gallery, and we are completely blown away by how beautifully the love and pure joy were captured. It’s been about 3 weeks since our wedding, which is SUCH a fast turnaround time especially for 11 HOURS of footage. We could not have asked for a better photography & videography experience. Even though there were 2 photographers, the style and editing were standardized so that all photos blended seamlessly. We didn’t have to worry about any potential differences in photography styles! Value: Pricing was reasonable for market standard and by far the best we’d seen during research, especially considering the high quality that we received and the extended amount of time that we were looking to cover. To summarize, we would highly recommend Original Weddings (which used to be Sound Originals) to couples who are looking for high quality photos at a reasonable cost and a responsive planning team. They’re a big organization with many locations across the U.S. which makes them more accessible no matter where you’re planning to have your wedding.

aving one focus on candid/documentary still pictures and the others be available for more traditional styled pictures. The communication throughout was good, we did not love the online platform but it worked. Josh was our main photographer and he was the star of this review and the main reason we ended up with any couple pictures at all as we barley gave him 10 minutes of our time and he made the absolute most of it. We’d recommend them.
