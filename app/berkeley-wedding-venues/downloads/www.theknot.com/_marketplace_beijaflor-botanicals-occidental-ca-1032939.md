Auna Lorin

Owner

I am a business owner and mother, born and raised in Sonoma County. I love the seasonal changes here and have always had an appreciation for the life cycles of plants and flowers. My experience really began as a child, with my grandmother's rose garden and my parents herb and flower gardens. This, with my innate eye for design, has now evolved into a successful business. When not working on research, marketing, floral proposals, contracts, foraging, and designs, most of my time is spent growing and tending beautiful gardens, or with my daughter and two wild and sweet Abyssinian cats!

She had beautiful dried florals that we used as well. We couldn’t have dreamed of anything more perfect for our event. It was truly magical. We had the best experience working with Auna and we highly recommend her!

Auna did incredible, incredible work for our wedding. Our priorities were local, seasonal, and sustainable sourcing, and of course beautiful designs. She guided the color profile w...

ith knowledge of what would be in season and took care to note what colors were in my bridal lehenga (Indian wedding dress). Auna was a great communicator throughout. The final product of her work was an incredible mandap (altar for Hindu ceremony), bouquet and vermalas, tablescape (fruit, potted plants AND flowers), and movable base arrangements that we were able to share across the two ceremony spaces & times. She also made wedding party bouts and bouqs, hair flowers, floral confetti, plus decorated a wagon for our flower tossing toddlers. Her work lives on in stunning photographs, which we cherish and share whenever we can! Auna and I had fun working together on the brief as well as the lead up to the wedding when she could share what she was seeing in season and available. I'm a ceramicist so Auna being open to using my bud vases in the final designs was such a special touch. The flowers lasted so long after, of those we brought home and were able to share with guests.

Beijaflor Botanicals floral arrangements were a highlight of our wedding weekend, and Auna's professionalism, warmth and excellent, creative collaboration made the planning process...

a breeze. So many guests commented on the flowers at our wedding which were really something special -- both elegant and wild, classically beautiful and representative of us personally and the late summer local northern California vibe of our event. I loved Auna's exuberant arrangements so much that I took home and dried several of the bouquets and corsages she crafted. I recommend Auna and Beijaflor Botanicals wholeheartedly to anyone looking for a vendor to work with on the flowers for their wedding.

ons. In all honesty I was not that excited about florals going into the planning process and thought of it as something to check the box and make sure our furniture wasn't too bare, but Auna's flowers and designs wound up being one of my very favorite parts of our event -- I didn't realize that arrangements could be so creative and so beautiful and interesting. Auna really understood the place and history and landscape where we hosted our event (Sea Ranch) and also worked with us to source plants/flowers that were local and in keeping with the values of our event. Auna's pricing was also very fair and much better value than other floral vendors we looked at. She is professional and enjoyable to work with. I'd highly recommend Auna and Beijaflor.

designed a gorgeous baby's breath arch for me that we got married under. Not only was she amazing at bringing my vision to life, she was also very respectful of budget.

me true!!! From the moment I first spoke to Auna, she was so sweet and wanted to make something work within out budget so we talked through everything and she made me feel so at ease with everything. I showed her a some photos of flowers that inspired me and she sent a mood board that brought my ideas and vision to life! She is an amazing communicator and you can tell that she has so much passion for what she does. Auna also made me feel so comfortable and anytime she had a question or wanted to clarify something, she would reach out and I always just left it up to her to make the final decision she felt was best and that's because she is amazing at what she does and I wholeheartedly trusted her! Come wedding day, Auna was there early setting up and someone ran in to tell me that I would not believe how beautiful the florals were for the wedding and they were right, I was completely blown away by how beautiful every single detail was! Auna exceeded all our expectations and truly made my wedding florals a DREAM COME TRUE! It was more beautiful and perfect than I ever could have imagined! My bridal bouquet, the floral drape on the tree, the welcome truck greenery, the many arrangements and bud vases around the ceremony and reception area were just BREATHTAKING! Our friends and family could not stop talking about how gorgeous the flowers were! Auna, you are truly an artist and a master at what you do! Anyone that works with you is truly the luckiest!!! Thank you for all your wonderful communication, amazing ideas, and for making the florals on our special day something I (and our guests) will never forget!!

n her to deliver. It was so much better than I anticipated! She nailed exactly the feeling I was going for and the blooms were perfection. She also helped us figure out how to reuse florals throughout the wedding (like moving welcome flowers to the bar) and helped us decorate the cake last minute. We did very limited decor, but it wasn't really necessary given how beautiful all the flowers were. I especially love that so many of them were local to the area and grown by Auna herself. For the bar, we first did a tasting which was a fun experience in itself. We chose three cocktails, all which had cordials and blends created by Auna. The flavors were delicious and surprising combinations! We knew our guests would have had nothing like it before. After 6 months, our friends are still bringing up how great the bar was and what a highlight it was at the wedding. Since my husband and I love food and drink, this was such an important element for us and Auna got it exactly right. I couldn't recommend working with Beijaflor Botanicals more. They are professional, personal, and true artists in what they do.

Auna is the heart and soul of Beijaflor Botanicals, and she is truly amazing!! Her talent and love for what she does show through her work. The flowers she did for my August, 2021 ...

wedding were INCREDIBLE. She was flexible and patient throughout my planning, despite a Covid-19 postponement and venue change. She accommodated budget restrictions while executing my vision more perfectly than I ever could have imagined. She also graciously allowed me to borrow some of her materials so we could repurpose wedding florals later in the wedding weekend. Communicating with her was easy and efficient, and she really heard everything I relayed to her. She grows many of her own flowers, which makes working with her even more special - she truly puts herself into what she offers. HIGHLY recommend working with Beijaflor Botanicals!

Like so many others, our original celebration was cancelled because of the coronavirus. My daughter and her fiancé wanted to get married and we quickly put together a small wedding...

in California wine country. The flowers were important to us and because we loved Beijaflor's portfolio, we secured them for the day. Auna is fantastic. My daughter gave her an inspiration board and she created the perfect florals for the day. Auna understood exactly what Alex wanted with her first proposal. She listened and was easy to communicate with, but most importantly she created gorgeous pieces to make our day even more perfect. The whole process was simple. Also to note, the flowers looks as good days later as they did on the big day!

omized style of local, seasonal, and wild foraged flowers. I sent her a few inspirational photos and from there she was able to make the perfect bouquet, boutonniere, and hair clip. Auna was so easy to work with and flexible. She was kind of enough to meet us at City Hall to drop off the flowers the day of our ceremony. While we communicated mostly via email and only met in person for a few minutes it was such a joy to work with her and the flowers photographed beautifully!

k, I knew I had to meet with her. When we first met, I had already started collecting inspiration pictures in regards to colors, textures etc. As we started going over the pictures, I could tell Auna was getting my vision and was getting excited about it. The creative wheels were turning. She was also very knowledgable in what exactly would be needed. She asked about cocktail tables, bar arrangement and welcome/seating signs. All of the extra stuff I hadn't really thought about. Then we go to the ceremony. I knew I wanted some sort of arch to help anchor the space and out she pulls the idea to do a circular arch with greenery and flowers. I was obsessed! and not only did she think of that but also recommended reusing the arch as the back drop to our Photo Booth. This is what we ended up doing and it was great! Auna during the entire process was very responsive and helpful. She attended a walk through with us at the venue with our coordinator and helped solidify the placement of the flowers and time lines in terms of when we would move the arch inside. Day of, the flowers were all beautiful and perfect. I have received so many compliments of the flowers from guests at the wedding. All in all, Auna was a pleasure to work with and I couldn't have asked for anything more.

When my MOH saw they were in the bouquets she was moved to tears. I can’t say enough great things about Beijaflor Botanicals. She executed the day flawlessly and we couldn't be happier with the results. I would highly recommend Beijaflor Botanicals to any bride.

She's easy and fun to work with and a calming presence when life is anything but :). I also used Auna for her botanical bar cocktails during the cocktail hour and all generic cocktails are now ruined for me. I barely ever drink but am sitting here writing this review (before noon), wishing I had one in front of me. As anyone planning a wedding knows, selecting the right wedding team is vitally important to your sanity, but most of us don't have any contacts in the industry yet and it all feels so overwhelming. Hopefully this review will make that daunting task a little easier for you!

I contacted Auna from Beijaflor Botanicals in early March 2019 for my wedding on May 26th 2019 at Triple S Ranch in Calistoga. If you read no further, just book Beijaflor Botanical...

s - you’ll be so happy you did. I left finding a florist to the last minute (in terms of wedding planning). Auna was quick about getting back to me with a broken down quote, proposal and contract. I had a “vision” of what I wanted and I felt like in talking with her she immediately understood what I was going for. Because I had waited so last minute she was already booked for another event, but fortunately her assistant was able to drop off all of the arrangements, move them around after our ceremony & pick up vases the following day - it went seamlessly! The proposal we received from Auna included images, cementing that she understood what I wanted & many of the photos were of her previous work; which made me feel confident I could have similar arrangements at my wedding and I knew what to expect. I had even fallen in love with a bouquet she made for another bride and she figured out a way to recreate the feel of that one for me - in my color palette & florals. I had been nervous about figuring out the right quantity & arrangements of florals; our specific venue had lots of very long, non-matching, rectangular tables and I was uneasy about how to make them not look sparse, but also didn’t have an endless budget to go “all-out.” Auna was able to meet & walk around our venue with us. We talked through quantities, placement and she was so great at suggesting ways we could reuse some of our ceremony florals for the reception and dinner. I knew I wanted to give some of the arrangements away to family and friends the day after the wedding and Auna figured out an easy way for us to do that! We received so many compliments and everyone was so excited to take an arrangement home with them. I even got a text months later from a friend reusing the vase, trying to recreate the arrangement we had given her from our wedding. Auna put in so much “behind the scenes” effort not only in sending me photos, finding new vases, talking through prices, and being open to last minute requests, but also in talking/coordinating with our day-of planner & venue... I truly believe she went above and beyond. I think we must’ve exchanged between 20 and 30 emails, texts and half a dozen phone calls and Auna was nothing short of flexible and responsive throughout the entire process. It was an absolute pleasure to work with Auna and if I ever throw another big party, I would hire Beijaflor Botanicals again in an instant!
