We can’t thank Rebekah enough for the gorgeous flowers she created for our wedding. The arrangements truly enhanced the venue and brought our vision to life. Our guests are still t...

alking about how stunning everything looked! Throughout the planning process, Rebekah was so patient, creative, and kind. She even worked with my dad to make the arch he made absolutely perfect, which meant so much to me. Every arrangement, bouquet, and little detail reflected her care and artistry. The florals were everything we dreamed of and more, and we’re so grateful to have had her as part of our day. 10/10 recommend hiring her for your wedding!

We had the pleasure of working with Rebekah from Flowers by Rebekah for our wedding, and we couldn't be happier with the exceptional experience she provided. From our limited knowl...

edge about flowers, she guided us through the process, helping us create stunning arrangements that perfectly complemented our bridal party attire and highlighted our chosen venue. Before meeting Rebekah, we had sorted through numerous pictures, trying to get a sense of what we liked and what would match well with our bridal party attire. However, it was Rebekah who truly brought our vision to life. With her expertise and keen eye for design, she took our limited understanding and transformed it into a beautiful reality. Rebekah's ability to navigate us through the floral selection process was outstanding. She carefully listened to our preferences and considered our venue and clothing choices when creating the arrangements. Her selection of vibrant and stunning flowers added a touch of elegance and beauty to our special day. Throughout the planning stages, Rebekah was kind, patient, and understanding. She made us feel comfortable, knowing that we were in capable hands. Her attention to detail and dedication to creating the perfect floral arrangements were evident in every conversation and interaction we had. We highly recommend Flowers by Rebekah to any couple in search of a talented and professional floral designer. Rebekah's ability to take your ideas and turn them into breathtaking arrangements is truly remarkable. Her expertise, kindness, and exceptional service made the entire process enjoyable and stress-free. Thank you, Rebekah, for your exceptional work and for adding a touch of beauty and elegance to our wedding day. We are forever grateful for your talent and dedication.

Rebekah was such a pleasure to work with and her floral designs are STUNNING. I loved everything I had seen her make and was so excited to work with her for our 2020 wedding. When ...

the wedding was postponed, I was worried that we wouldn’t get the chance to work with her, but she was able to still help us for our 2022 celebration and I am so grateful it worked out. The flowers were amazing, and I appreciated that she was willing to help us stick to our budget and even suggested some alternatives for us when prices changed over the years. She made a beautiful greenery garland for our homemade chuppah, everyone loved my bouquet and the centerpieces really tied the whole look together.

e that everything we chose really complimented the venue. I spoke with a couple different florists over the phone and after my call with Rebekah I knew she was the right fit for us. She totally understood what I was looking for and was able to send me photos of similar work she had done before. She also eased my mind and came up with a great contingency plan in case of rain. She was incredibly responsive to any questions or concerns I had and she had a very reasonable quote to me within a couple days of our initial call. On the day of the wedding we were completely blown away by her work - she transformed the arch that we were getting married under and every details from the bouquets, to the centerpieces, to the greenery on our welcome sign was absolutely perfect. We credit her for making our wedding day feel like us - and that's priceless! On top of all of that Rebekah is so kind and accommodating - the exact type of person that you want around on such a special day!

band and I planned our Sonoma County wedding remotely from Seattle and Rebekah was not only extremely responsive to email, she found time to meet with us (and my parents!) in-person during one of our trips to Sonoma County. Rebekah was so friendly and patient at every moment. On the day of our wedding, I was so so so excited to see Rebekah because of the wonderful relationship we had developed during the planning process. Rebekah is a vendor who will always be on your side and will figure out how to make your vision a reality. Thank you Rebekah for helping to make our wedding absolutely magical!

My husband and I worked with Rebekah on our wedding last month and we could not have been happier with her from beginning to end! Especially considering we were planning an out of ...

state wedding, it was incredibly helpful to work with someone who was knowledgeable, kind, thorough, and always made us feel like our happiness was her priority. Rebekah made the whole process so easy and was very patient with us when we were being a little indecisive. What was even better than working with her was the final product. The flowers at our wedding were simply stunning and Rebekah exceeded our expectations in being able to bring our wedding vision to life. From our perfectly executed chuppah to the bouquets and the dinner tables, Rebekah artfully created floral arrangements that brought so much beauty to an already beautiful space (we got married at a winery). She was there the day of our wedding so we had the pleasure of meeting her in person, and she was just as wonderful as the interactions we had had with her over the phone and via email prior to the day. We also appreciated that Rebekah made it so easy for us to re-purpose arrangements from our ceremony and cocktail hour into the reception space. She knew that we were on a budget and helped come up with ideas to allow us to have the dream day that we wanted. If you are looking for a florist, look no further than Rebekah because she simply is the best!

We never got the chance to meet in person on our actual wedding day, but we did have a phone consultation with her and she was sweet, straightforward, honest, and professional. She...

answered all of our concerns thoroughly and was very flexible when we needed certain things changed or added. We appreciated that she was very professional in following up with us with certain details or decisions that she needed to know about. We also appreciated her patience and flexibility, especially the times that she needed a response on a decision promptly and we had to request more time. Her floral arrangements were absolutely beautiful. I had sent her my Pinterest board previously and she was able to depict my style and idea exactly. We would definitely recommend her to anyone looking for a florist for a wedding or any party.

pond, incredibly nice, and is truly talented at what she does! We also rented an arbor with floral arrangements through Rebekah. She took care of everything from setting up to tearing down. The arbor was the most perfect, breathtaking touch to our ceremony! I would highly recommend Rebekah to any of my friends and family!

Rebekah is flower magic! I knew what I wanted but had a hard time articulating exactly what it was (don't speak flower lingo very well). I created a pinterest page and Rebekah coul...

d see a theme and the look I was going after. I wanted in between "wild" and "tailored" and she did just that! I really wanted the flowers to brighten up each space - we had a summer wedding and I've always been attracted to bright colors - but I didn't want it looking tacky. She paired brighter fushia and purple flowers with light pink, coral, and pretty greenery + dusty miller to give the most beautiful and balanced combination. She is so kind, has great energy, came highly praised by our venue, and I didn't have to worry about a thing! The area (Sonoma County) is very $$ and many florists told me my max budget wouldn't get me much but Rebekah was able to give me everything with the highest quality.

She clearly listened to every detail and got really creative to make my vision work and also, most importantly, keep it in my budget! I would highly recommend working with Rebekah if you are looking for a florist! Not only does she do stellar work, but she is an absolute pleasure to work with!! Such a doll!
