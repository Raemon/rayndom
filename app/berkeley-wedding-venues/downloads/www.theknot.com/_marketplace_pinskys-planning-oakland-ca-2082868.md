If you want your event to be a success, you'll want to hire Miriam. Every review already written about Miriam is 100% accurate and yet somehow still doesn't capture how phenomenal ...

of a job she does. Her expert insights balanced perfectly with her respect for our wishes/vision and her genuine desire to make sure our day was exactly as we wanted it. Miriam has a fantastic eye and mind for detail, not only does she think of everything but she's very quick to recognize potential problems when pitching ideas and even quicker to find a solution, all before the end of a phone call. Booking with Miriam also includes expertly designed templates and timelines, which she updates as quickly as your plans do so you're never in the dark and always on the same page. Everything leading up the wedding was super organized and she kept us on track with decision making, deposits, reservations, etc. the whole time. On the wedding day, Miriam was a superhero. Things went wrong that we didn't even know about, all because Miriam is that good. I don't know how she somehow teleported from our reception venue (where she had been setting up all morning) to our ceremony venue, but in true Miriam fashion, she was there the second we needed her. She's a kind, friendly person who is easy to talk to and get along with but she is also a strong, professional woman when doing her job and won't let your vendors screw around on you, which became so important on the day of our wedding when miscommunications/broken promises came up with other vendors. Miriam is a thinker, a doer, and a fixer, all rolled up in one and will make sure your day is amazing, no matter what issues pop up. I think it's also important to note that she is so cool, calm, and collected when the plan changes in the moment that it really helps you have the best time! Being the controlling and anxious person that I am, I would have thought I'd be stressed out the whole day but I wasn't stressed or worried at all- I had complete and total trust in Miriam and it was obviously well placed. When I say that she handled everything, I mean it. Everything! She set up the giant venue, she managed the venue staff, the DJ, coordinated with the officiant, made sure we ate, coordinated with every single vendor, even our photographers knew what was going on the whole day and had a printed copy of the timeline! Overall, hiring Pinsky's Planning should be the easiest decision you make when planning your event and it most certainly will be the best decision. I couldn't recommend her more highly. 10/10 the best!

I cannot say enough wonderful things about Miriam. She was truly the backbone of our entire wedding experience. From the very beginning, she was thoughtful, organized, and incredib...

ly supportive. She checked in with us every week, guided us through every decision, and took full ownership of all vendor communication. We had over seven vendors, a DJ and musician pairing, an after party, and special moments like a t-shirt toss. There were so many moving parts, yet Miriam managed everything with absolute calm and confidence. On the wedding day, everything ran perfectly on time, and it all felt effortless because Miriam was behind the scenes making sure every detail was handled. She coordinated with every vendor, set up and tore down the event, kept the timeline flawless, and made sure we never had to worry about anything. Her presence allowed us to simply enjoy our day without stress. What meant the most to us was her genuine warmth. Miriam felt like family throughout the process. She cared deeply about making our day special, and it showed in every interaction. She supported us not only logistically but emotionally as well, and we trusted her completely. Genuinely, our wedding could not have happened without her. Hiring Miriam was one of the best decisions we made, and we feel so grateful for everything she did to make our day perfect. If you are considering working with her, do it. She is truly a blessing.

We worked with Miriam for our day of coordination and EventZ for the months leading up to our wedding at the Brazilian Room. Miriam fulfilled all expectations of setup, event flow,...

communication, and coordination of people (guests and vendors). She exemplified strong emotional intelligence, which is important on a day when emotions run high. When necessary, she was able to problem solve or pivot, including working with the DJ to find an alternative way to connect our iPad to the projector for our slide show and wrangling the entire wedding to pose for a group photo (120 people). We felt she prioritized our preferences to the best she could. We appreciated her coordinating our rehearsal as well including playing the ceremony music so we could practice timing everything. Our event went so smoothly and we plus our guests all had a great time- thanks to all the pre-planning with EventZ and Miriam's work the day of.

one and video calls with us as needed to ensure we felt taken care of throughout the whole process. Miriam was also our point of contact for all of the vendors, making sure everyone was on the same page. She also planned and guided the rehearsal which really put us in the right mindset and helped prepare the wedding party for the correct sequence of events. She was the perfect balance between directive and sweet, she got things done, but everyone felt comfortable and impressed by her along the way. Miriam executed the whole event flawlessly which led to our wedding day being stress and worry free, allowing us to enjoy the day to its fullest. She helped us set up and break down SO MANY of the wedding details/decor alongside the caterers and florist. Everything looked incredible and thoughtful. She made all the right autonomous decisions but also included us in anything she needed input on, we would recommend her to anyone looking to plan their wedding.

I may be 11 months late in writing this review, but Miriam went above and beyond to ensure that our special day went off without a hitch so I would be remiss not to share my wonder...

ful experience with the bridal community. As a naturally anxious person, I can’t overemphasize how pivotal her competence and professionalism were in allowing me to relax and enjoy my wedding day without stress or distraction. Miriam was able to understand my priorities and ask the right questions to get the information she needed to do her job well. She took the reins from this anxious bride with compassionate confidence, and I immediately felt the weight lifted off my shoulders. As soon as we agreed to hire her, she took ownership of all of the pesky details with efficiency and grace so I no longer had to manage the chaos alone. From planning, to our rehearsal dinner, to ensuring that our ceremony and reception were executed flawlessly, I couldn’t have done it without her. While I wouldn’t necessarily recommend planning a DIY home wedding like we did (ours was held on my sister’s property in Petaluma), if you do, Miriam is the partner you didn’t know you needed. If you’re looking for the best in the Bay, you’ve found her. I highly recommend engaging Miriam in whatever capacity you can afford, as her services and expertise are priceless. Seriously though- you can’t put a price on the amount of stress that this one woman powerhouse is capable of eliminating. Thanks for everything Miriam, you’re a rockstar!

touch and organization made the night everything I dreamed of. All our guests commented on how beautiful everything was and how friendly and helpful she was. Her ability to anticipate and pivot when things are going a bit wonky was magical.

Thank you Miriam for making our dreams come true and helping me keep us keep our sanity.

dding at the Piedmont Community Hall in Oakland. The venue is pretty bare bones, only providing tables and chairs, so we had to coordinate everything else ourselves - including drop off catering, waitstaff, rentals, silk floral & decor rentals, DJ, photo/video, drop off alcohol, and more! Miriam really pulled everything together on the day-of. Everything was set up just as I envisioned and the flow of the day was super smooth. This was definitely in-part due to her great coordination of the wedding party during the rehearsal the day before. She did an awesome job wrangling everyone in the wedding party, our families, and all the vendors on our wedding day. We really didn't have to worry about a thing! She additionally had to deal with an upset family member, who she met with grace and respect. I highly recommend Miriam for your wedding planning & coordination needs!

She has many years of experience successfully coordinating weddings of all sizes at many of our popular Bay Area venues. She's a delight to work with, positive attitude and is well versed with wedding coordination in general. Her work ethnic is one of my favorite traits about her. Always willing to be flexible and go that extra mile for the client. Any couple would be lucky to have her as their Coordinator.
