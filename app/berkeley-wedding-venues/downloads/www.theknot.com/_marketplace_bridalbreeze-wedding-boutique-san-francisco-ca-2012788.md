The dresses are great and the service was even better. I came in very nervous about trying on wedding dresses for the first time, but Ariel immediately made me feel welcome and c...

omfortable. She took time to learn more about me and my wedding before walking me through the store. She took care to show me which sections to focus on based on my preferences and budget, giving me plenty of space and time to pick out a handful to try on. All of the dresses were beautiful, and Ariel took the time to help me understand the pros and cons of each. I fell in love with one of the dresses, which was at the lower end of my price range. While the store probably would have made more money from me buying new, she let me know I could buy the sample for 30% less. She put absolutely no pressure on me to buy anything or make firm decisions. Thanks to all of this, I felt comfortable saying YES to the dress, and I took home my dream gown the same day. I would 100% recommend this bridal shop to any friends or family in the Bay Area.

This was my favorite stop by far. Marina was my stylist and she was the kindest person I had ever met. I am a curvy gal and was nervous about shopping for my dress but she made me ...

feel spectacular. The samples are all around a mid-size, but the stylists are trained in a way that they can clip anyone in, no matter your body type. I didn’t bring any guests but Marina helped me by taking pictures for me and giving honest (but constructive) opinions about the dresses I tried. All in all, this was an amazing experience. I recommend this bridal shop to everyone I know who is looking for an incredible dress shopping experience!

I had a great experience at Bridal Breeze. I had tried on dresses at another popular bay area bridal store, which was not bad at all, but this place was a little more intimate and ...

less hectic. Marina and her staff were patient, non-judgemental and informative about timing of the dress buying process and how to factor in alterations afterwards. They also gave me honest feedback about some of the other dresses that I liked but wasn't sure about. I truly appreciated this since I had no idea how long that was supposed to take! I have the most beautiful Pronovias dress that I cannot wait to wear. I would wholeheartedly recommend this shop to other future brides looking for their perfect dress.

Marina and Mary were great! We tried on a ton of different dresses to help me narrow down my style. They didn't pressure or push me. They even opened early for me to come back a se...

cond time before I said yes to the dress. Would highly recommend adding Bridal Breeze to your must go to dress shops!

I аm Aѕiаn, and I was a bridе who wanted rеаllу mоdеrn dress; ѕоmеthing nеw, fashionable аnd brеаth-tаking. I ԛuiсklу rеаlizеd thаt it ѕhоuld bе ѕоmе designer dress like Berta оr ...

I am рrеttу ѕtаndаrd ѕhаре and ѕlim, thus thе drеѕѕ fit реrfесtlу. All thе fеаthеrѕ had very ѕtуliѕh lооkѕ: Exасtlу whаt I wаntеd! Surprisingly the drеѕѕ was light аnd ѕuреr convenient tо wеаr fоr the whоlе dау. Thank you BridalBreeze!

о wedding drеѕѕ. Thuѕ, I ѕtаrtеd tо сhооѕе mу drеѕѕ from offline ѕtоrеѕ. After checking out about fivе ѕаlоnѕ, I hаd already had the idеа of what I wаntеd аnd what dresses wеrе a good match for mе. Althоugh thе рriсе fоr the drеѕѕ I wаntеd was ridiculously high, I ѕtаrtеd tо ѕеаrсh the Intеrnеt, hорing tо find thе dress I likеd; thаt wаѕ hоw I came uр with BridalBreeze. I сhоѕе twо (2) drеѕѕеѕ as I wаѕn’t ѕurе whiсh оnе I wаntеd. I соntасtеd BridalBreeze and аѕkеd for more рhоtоѕ and they rеѕроndеd immеdiаtеlу. In a couple of days, I gоt thе аdditiоnаl рhоtоѕ of the drеѕѕеѕ and some vidеоѕ. Thеу аlѕо wеrе аѕking ѕоmе ԛuеѕtiоnѕ аbоut mу рrеfеrеnсеѕ and body ѕhаре; wе hаd a grеаt hеlрful соnvеrѕаtiоn. I finаllу сhоѕе thе drеѕѕ I likеd. After I fillеd оut and sent thе mеаѕurеmеntѕ, thеу wrоtе thаt the drеѕѕ wоuld bе rеаdу in 5 wееkѕ. To my utmоѕt ѕurрriѕе, it took 4 wееkѕ аnd 2 wееkѕ tо deliver tо Tеxаѕ; whilе waiting I was nеrvоuѕ. Whеn thе drеѕѕ came, аll mу sisters gathered аrоund to tаkе a lооk. When I wеnt out frоm my rооm tо show thеm, I saw everything in their eyes аnd undеrѕtооd thаt thе drеѕѕ wаѕ perfect. I likеd it ѕо much! Thаnk уоu BridalBreeze!

I am blown away by how GORGEOUS my dress is! It's insanely beautiful and fits PERFECTLY! I was extremely hesitant to order online and I can say that you will not find the high end ...

quality at this price anywhere else. Chelsea and the BridalBreeze team has also been extremely helpful communicating with me throughout the whole process. I highly recommend ordering through BridalBreeze and I am so thankful for having stumbled upon their site. I am so excited to be able to wear my dream dress on my wedding day!
