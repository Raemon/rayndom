It took me a while to write this review because I really wanted to reflect on my whole experience with them. I can say without a shadow of doubt, that this bridal shop was my favor...

ite experience during my entire wedding process. On my first trip down there, I was welcomed in by Madina and her mother. They made us feel so comfortable and really listened to my mother and I as we started picking dresses. We picked a couple to try and they picked a couple for me to try based off of what we said we liked and wanted. I ended up going with the first dress I tried on and made a lot of alterations to the gown. Madina was very true to her word, she told me the price that you see and pay for the dress is all inclusive of alterations, appointments, tailoring, customizations, everything. Just as she said, I did not pay a penny more for the dress than the price that was on the tag (I added lace to the dress, sleeves, altered the height and size multiple times, added some extra sparkle, even still the price never changed). Every appointment they took their time making sure we were heard and addressed every single detail and correction we wanted to make on the dress. Madina was very responsive to all my texts and questions during the entire process. It was a bitter sweet experience on the final dress fitting as I picked up my absolutely gorgeous wedding dress, but said goodbye to some of the best people in the wedding industry. Everyone in the shop to the seamstresses were amazing and I would recommend them to anyone.
