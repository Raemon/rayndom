House of Couture tailored my dress perfectly for my wedding day! Sharifa Raouf made sure I felt comfortable and confident in my dress during each fitting. I am grateful that I was ...

connected with her to tailor my dress as she promptly answered any questions I had and also went out of her way to work with my schedule for dress fittings. I had a sweetheart top and a medium-sized train, but Sharifa made sure the dress was snug in the right places and that I could feel comfortable dancing the night away. She addressed any concerns I had and provided helpful advice on how to take of my dress. I was thrilled that I could easily and gracefully move around in my dress. I have also taken my dress in to be preserved through House of Couture and Sharifa also graciously offered to see if my wedding shoes can be cleaned. I am definitely returning to Sharifa for all dresses and clothes that need tailoring in the future.
