For the record: Nothing in life is *100%* free, even merch that's gifted by top brands. Now that we've spoken our peace, you're likely looking for __ free __ bachelorette items, especially if you're passing out cute gift bags to your crew of besties (which is one of the current [bachelorette party trends](https://www.theknot.com/content/bachelorette-party-statistics), BTW). We're going to show you how to respectfully and thoughtfully reach out to top brands and ask if they're open to gifting you free samples to add to your gift bags. 

A quick glance at TikTok reveals that there are plenty of national companies that may offer free bachelorette gifts. It's a trend that's popping off right now, and really, what better way to stuff your gal pals' bags full of goodies than to score them without added cost? That being said, we want to be clear about one ground rule: only participating companies apply in this scenario. Think about the small businesses that need every purchase and every impression. When you're crafting your outreach about free bachelorette items, be mindful about who can support these asks. (In other words, buy local.) For the rest, here are a few tips and pointers for ways you can potentially score swag for your crew.

## Tips for Getting Free Bachelorette Items

Think you can't get free bachelorette gifts because you don't have a large online presence? Think again. It's possible to reach out to companies and request free samples and other giveaways. You don't necessarily have to be an influencer to get responses, although we can't guarantee every brand will say yes. (Again, we reiterate that smaller and local businesses likely won't be able to support with inventory at all! Pick your retailers thoughtfully.)

In select instances, however, the situation could be a win-win for national brands that have inventory to comp. These companies may want to market their swag authentically while building exposure for their businesses among smaller groups of fans. Bachelorette parties are a great fit, sometimes, for these businesses as these events not only bring groups of besties together, but are often documented on social media as multi-day festivities unfold. 

Here, we've included some tips you can try if you're wondering how to get free pieces for a bachelorette swag bag. 

  * **Refer to TikTok's curated list of companies that often give freebies**. Chances are, if current or recent brides are saying they've scored free items, you could too. Certain companies and brands have been historically generous with free samples, especially if they sell a product that's well matched to bachelorette parties (like skincare products, drink mixers or sunscreen).
  * **Start at the company website**. Go to the Contact Us page and find the email form. They may even have a dedicated section to request samples. If the brand is a good fit for your event, then proceed with filling out the email form with your name and contact information. Write a brief blurb asking the company if they'd be willing to provide samples for your bachelorette party attendees.
  * **Selectively use social media**. Find a company's social media page and consider asking for samples there. It's possible they won't respond due to volume and settings. Separately, we don't recommend cold outreach to internal employees at a company, though, because they're likely inundated with other career requests. 



## Bachelorette Freebies From The Knot

Did you know that the free tools from The Knot aren't only for nearlyweds in the throes of wedding planning? There are some handy (and free) resources from The Knot that'll enhance your bach planning experience.

## Bachelorette PR Email Template for Free Gifts

One thing's for sure: It's not hard to score bachelorette party PR for your party bags. Just a simple, quick email or message is all it takes, as long as the company believes in the value of handing out free samples in exchange for product exposure. And, spoiler alert: while some companies do, many don't. It's all about knowing what companies have availability of inventory and sending the right pitch. Below, we've included a few bachelorette PR email templates you can use to loosely inspire your own custom outreach. 

**For a generic approach:  
**_Dear [company name or PR contact],_

_I'm getting married in [month] and my bachelorette party is coming up on [date]! I'm SO excited to show my bridesmaids how much I appreciate them with swag bags filled with some of my favorite products._

_To that end, I wondered if you might be willing to provide me with some free samples to include. While I particularly enjoy [your favorite product], I would be thrilled with anything you'd like to send, and would be happy to post our reviews on social media after the bachelorette party. Thank you so much for your consideration!_

_All the best,  
__[Name]_

**For a decoration:  
**_Dear [company name or PR contact],_

_I'm getting married in [month] and my bachelorette party is coming up on [date]! I'm planning a [theme] theme for my party, and I thought your [decoration] would make a perfect addition to my bachelorette party decor. I was wondering if you'd be willing to send me [number] of samples so that I could decorate with them? In exchange, I would be happy to post photos including your decorations on my social media accounts and tag your company._

_Thank you so much for considering!  
__All the best,  
__[Name]_

**For a specific product:  
**_Dear [company name or PR contact],_

_I'm getting married in [month] and my bachelorette weekend is coming up on [date]! We're headed to [location] and I'm working on putting together [beach]-themed gift bags for my girls. I can't imagine these swag bags being complete without your amazing [product] included, since it's my absolute favorite [sunscreen/hydration drink/mixer/etc.]. I'm constantly telling everyone who will listen how much I love it. I was hoping you might be willing to send me [number] samples of your amazing product to share with my besties! Thanks so much for considering!_

_All the best,  
__[Name]_

## Other Free Bachelorette Items to Take Advantage Of

In addition to all the great free bachelorette items you can potentially collect through contacting your favorite brands for samples, there are other ways to throw a bach party on the cheap, too! Several places offer free (or nearly free) resources like [free printable bachelorette games](https://www.theknot.com/content/bachelorette-printables#free-printable-bachelorette-party-games), [planning checklists](https://www.theknot.com/content/bachelorette-parties-planning-checklist), [packing lists](https://www.theknot.com/content/bachelorette-party-what-to-pack) and more. 

### Free (or Nearly Free) Bachelorette Printables

Below are our favorite options for free (or almost free) printables, including party games, stickers and invitations. 

  * This set of clean bachelorette party games is a great choice if you'd like to stay away from some of the more common, suggestive games. It's beautifully displayed and clocks in at under $2 (printing costs are additional, of course) on [Etsy](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6220&awinaffid=565019&campaign=tk-free-bachelorette-items&platform=dl&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Flisting%2F1424925449%2Fclean-bachelorette-party-games-clean). 
  * This free printable set from [Hand Lettered Printables](https://handletteredprintables.com/bachelor-bingo-bachelorette-bingo-free-printable-cards/) allows you to create and customize your very own bachelorette BINGO game. 
  * [Suite Bliss Printables](https://www.suiteblissprintables.com/games/bachelorette-drink-if-game/) brings you this fun "Drink If" game, one of the most popular bachelorette party games out there. Separated into four rounds, this printable features a border of attractive florals. 
  * [Vista Create](https://create.vista.com/features/stickers/) is a website that allows you to create and customize your own stickers, then download and print them as you need. It's free aside from the cost of printing. 
  * Design site [Canva](https://www.canva.com/templates/s/bachelorette/) is your one-stop shop for printable templates! They've got a host of cool bachelorette party content, but you'll have to pay for a monthly Canva membership in order to access most of it. The price of printing is additional, too, but it's a great place to snag printable invitations, decor and games.



### Even More Free Bachelorette Goodies 

The freebies simply don't stop coming. Here are more free things for you to take advantage of. 

  * [Sephora](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=9ibcrDa*U1o&mid=2417&u1=TK-free-bachelorette-items&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fbeauty%2Fsamples) and [Ulta](https://howl.link/2o0k3wa7fsmhh?article_name=The+Knot&article_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheknotww.com%2F17685013053599?u1=TK-free-bachelorette-items) both offer free beauty samples that are impossible to pass up.
