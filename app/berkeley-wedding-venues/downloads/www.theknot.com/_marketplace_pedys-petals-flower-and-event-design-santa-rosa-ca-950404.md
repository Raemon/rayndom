My god did we love working with Pedy! She was incredible - our florals came out absolutely stunning. She worked with us to make our vision come true in the budget that we had. Pedy...

stood out in the pouring rain to lay out all of our florals and make everything perfect - she went above and beyond and we had a blast going through our wedding planning process with her. Pedy is incredibly detail oriented and caught a mistake I had made on layout weeks before our big day just in time to save the day. Cannot recommend working with her enough for your wedding or events - she's also hilarious, thank you so much Pedy and team!!!

Pedy and her team did an excellent job executing my vision and works with my budget. Pedy patiently let me tweak the florals several times until the aesthetic was what I wanted. I ...

had a particular vision in my head and I appreciated the level of communication I received to make it happen. I really wanted a certain bouquet ribbon style (velvet with frayed ends) but couldn’t purchase it in time. I sent just regular velvet to the shop but they were able to fray the ends for me, which was unexpected, and it looked beautiful. Pedy was able to guide me where to spend our budget and what florals could get double utility. We had a wonderful experience and felt they were very competitively priced, especially for wine country. In addition, she was just so warm and remember about our newborn. I felt very happy we could give her our business.

s point by point and made sure we had what we needed! She took all of my Pinterest ideas and magically brought them all to life! My bouquet was just so insanely gorgeous, I cried when she brought it up to me! She designed beautiful arrangements for our ceremony arch that doubled for our sweetheart table decor! She is brilliant. She is remarkably talented. Moreover, she genuinely cares about her brides and clients. She one hundred percent earned my highest of recommendations!!! Thank you Pedy for playing such a crucial role in making our wedding day so perfect!!

experience. Pedy is so fun, loving and energetic! Her and Cindy are such a great team and they are extremely responsive to your needs. Now to talk about the service and the flowers, all I can say is WOW!! I gave Pedy just some ideas that I was thinking of and she "ran" with it. She went above and beyond to make sure our wedding day turned out beautiful and perfect!! My bouquet was the most perfect one I have ever came across in my life. Pedy really listens to your needs and goes above and beyond expectations. All of my guests who ytook a flower arrangement home made it clear to me that they will be using Pedy's Petals for occasions they need flowers. My hat is off to all of you! Thank you for everything you have done for us. We will miss working with you!!

ad wreaths complemented my flowers perfectly. As far as the rest of the table and decoration flowers went: my only requirements were that they were BIG arrangements with LOTS of color that complimented my bouquet and the venue. And that is exactly what I got plus some!! They were out of the world beautiful! I mean so beautiful that I had guests calling and texting me for days after saying how beautiful the flowers were!! I could go on and on... but I will keep it short(ish) and just say: Pedy and her team clearly love what they do and know how to execute an event flawlessly. If I could give them 10 stars I would.

I can’t begin to put into words how pleased we were with Pedy and her spectacular team. She delivered on creating the most picture-perfect fairytale wedding. Our flowers were unbel...

ievably beautiful. We worked with her to create long rectangular planter boxes as our centerpieces for each table. She planted a variety of flowering plants, succulents, herbs, etc. in each creating the most spectacular arrangements!! She also prepared 100 bud vases for our tables full of wildflowers, the tables were spectacular! She made the most perfect boutonnieres for the men, with tiny succulents – they were exactly what we had asked for (and more!). My bouquet was also incredible. I had shown Pedy a picture of my dream bouquet and she created some even more magical than I could have imagined. It was breathtaking! She created buckets of flowers for our ceremony isle, and several large arrangements for throughout the reception as well. I couldn’t believe how much we were able to do within our tight budget – she worked WONDERS. More than anything Pedy gave us the most solid peace of mind. She made everything happen totally seamlessly. Her team also helped coordinate our décor for the wedding – which was an absolutely monumental task. It allowed my mom and sister to spend time with me before the wedding instead of having to run around and worry about the décor. She was calm, collected, and never gave me any reason to stress or worry… there is no price tag that can be put on this! She was extremely easy to work with and wonderfully communicative. There is no doubt our wedding would not have been what it was without her. I couldn’t imagine choosing anyone else to work with – her and her team are AMAZING.

at ideas for vases and layouts on the tables according to my daughter's colors of red, black and white. She even found some unique red vases with Love carved on the front that fit perfect with the theme. Thank you so much Pedy for providing your expertise and floral knowledge to help make this day so very special indeed!

pplemented with blue delphinium and white flowers. From the centerpieces, to the ceremony flower arrangements, to the bouquets, everything was exactly how I imagined it. They are reasonably priced for the amount of beautiful flowers that we received, and Pedy worked with me to keep the price within our budget. Thank you for making our wedding day colorful and lovely!!!

I picked Pedy's petals as my florist because I had seen Pedy's work at a friends wedding. Pedy did the most amazing job I have ever seen on flowers and was an absolute pleasure to ...

work with. I took in my grandmothers wedding dress (just the jacket) and told her to cut it to fit around my bouquet. Not only did it look amazing, she put the entire jacket around it so we didn't have to cut it into pieces. the second I saw it I broke out in tears. Pedy and her work are second to none, I would recommend her to anyone and everyone I know! She goes the extra mile, thank you PEDY!

y bridesmaids! Pedy is very outgoing and excited about what she does. When we came into her shop to go over ideas, she saw my vision and made it come to life! She was open to my suggestions and we felt like we were talking to a friend. On the day of the wedding, we somehow did not receive a bag of loose rose petals that were supposed to be scattered on our tables. I asked Pedy about it and she said they were delivered with the rest of the flowers, but that the chef at our venue was carrying things in. Our venue says they were not delivered. We will never know and are bummed out that we didn't have the added color on the tables, but Pedy said she would refund us the amount we paid for the petals. My only suggestion for Pedy would be to bring her own staff to help her make a delivery so that a chef isn't the one doing it, leading to mix-ups like this. Other than that, our gorgeous flowers far supersede the mix-up and I could not have been happier with how they turned out!
