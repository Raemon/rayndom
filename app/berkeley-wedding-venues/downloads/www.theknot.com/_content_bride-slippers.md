Before you walk down the aisle, officially say "I do" or change into your dancing shoes, there is the morning of—and that requires footwear all its own. Bridal slippers can be plush and cozy, chic and glamorous or customized with your monogram, but they all have one thing in common: They're meant to create a calm, comfortable, spa-like vibe for the morning of your biggest day. 

Our best suggestion: Choose your getting-ready attire first. Will you wear a [bridal robe](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-robes) or a two-piece [bridal pajama set](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-pajamas)? Will it be white or something that coordinates with your wedding palette or aesthetic? Will your bridesmaids match, or will you have your own look? Once you have the attire figured out, choose cozy footwear to match the vibe. Here, we've curated a list full of options to match a wide variety of loungewear looks, plus where to shop for them.

  * Where to Buy Bride and Bridesmaid Slippers
  * 26 Best Bridal Slippers for Getting Ready in Style



## Where to Buy Bride and Bridesmaid Slippers

Depending on what you're looking for, you can turn to brands known for comfort or high style—and if you're an Amazon girlie, there are countless options there, too. Here are our four favorite places to shop for bridal slippers. 

[**Etsy**](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6220&awinaffid=565019&clickref=tk-bride-slippers&platform=dl&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2F)**:** The platform has endless slipper offerings, and you can find whimsical and unique pairs like the fully embroidered ones that made our list below. Make sure you check the pricing structure, as many are listed for very low prices that go up as you add customization or due to shipping. 

[**Amazon**](https://www.amazon.com/?tag=tkcommerce-218-20)**:** Amazon is the perfect go-to if you don't want to splurge on bridal slippers (which is understandable). The majority of slippers here are $25 or less. Check reviews, especially for slippers with embellishments or ones you plan to wear again and again, to make sure they'll hold up.

[**Lé Rose Stories**](https://shoplerose.com/)**:** If you're planning to use slippers as [bridesmaid gifts](https://www.theknot.com/content/inspiring-bridesmaid-gift-ideas), look to brands known for quality, such as Lé Rose Stories. While they don't have a large variety of slippers—really, just variations on one particular style—it's quality over quantity. The label is actually best known for its bridal [robes](https://shoplerose.com/collections/all-robes) and [PJ sets](https://shoplerose.com/collections/sleepwear), so you can shop the whole look here. 

[**XO, Fetti**](https://xofetti.pxf.io/55Yo63)**:** Full of fun, cheeky and whimsical merch for your entire bride era—check them out for [bachelorette must-haves](https://xofetti.pxf.io/XmO7bb)—XO, Fetti offers bridal slippers (and socks!) for the party bride. The brand's products are often available on Amazon, too, but you can go directly to the source for the full range.
