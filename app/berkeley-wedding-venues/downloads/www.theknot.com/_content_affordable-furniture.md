Ideally, your wedding registry should be a mix of affordable and big-ticket items to represent both your needs and your guests' budgets. Especially if you're working together to set up your home, including furniture on a wedding registry is a great way for your guests to help you kick off married life. 

Of course, furniture can be incredibly pricey! But there are a few ways to go about adding furniture to your wedding registry without overwhelming your guests financially (hint: [The Knot Registry Store](https://www.theknot.com/registry) is a great place to start!). In this article, we'll cover several different ways of asking for furniture on your wedding registry, along with some pieces we're digging these days.

## Can You Put Furniture on a Wedding Registry?

There aren't any etiquette rules that prevent you from adding furniture to your registry. It's absolutely okay, says Kobi Cummings, certified wedding and event planner and co-owner of [The Valley Venues](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/the-valley-venues-wildwood-ga-2079305) in Wildwood, Georgia. "I think people worry that guests will think it's tacky to have expensive things on your registry. But guests can split a present; why not donate toward a gift," she says. In fact, one of Cummings' favorite [wedding registry tips](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-registry-26-top-tips) is to mix both large and small gift items. And that means furniture gets a green light!

But it's good to have realistic expectations: No matter how many people you invite to your wedding, it's unlikely your guests will bestow you with a whole house full of furniture. But that doesn't mean you can't score a few great pieces to help you get started setting up your home together. Here are just a few ways you can add furniture to your wedding registry and avoid any [wedding registry mistakes](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-registry-etiquette). 

### Register for Small Pieces

Skip the bedroom suite and instead opt for more affordable wedding registry furniture, like a coffee table, set of two kitchen chairs or barstools or even a bookshelf. These items help you fill in your home without causing guests to shy away and opt for less expensive gifts. In the next section, we've included several trendy options you can add to your registry.

### Create a Central Registry at The Knot Registry Store

Register at a single place that allows you to mix pricier furniture with more affordable options like towels, kitchenwares or gift cards. [The Knot Registry Store](https://www.theknot.com/registry/store/categories/home/furniture) is a one-stop shop that allows you to register for this and much more, all in one convenient location. Plus, you can easily link your registry to your [wedding website](https://www.theknot.com/gs/wedding-websites?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Search+%7C+WWS+%7C+Brand&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=1459207190&gbraid=0AAAAADiu8Tl0TbcYYAaXqOZ_npb7XivOB&gclid=CjwKCAjw3tzHBhBREiwAlMJoUjLGkaLdr4ia37-Yqx_pDJaoIBNCMmkvRIwdPVHo_v8_BGUMu2DIyRoCMhwQAvD_BwE) to make things uber-easy for your guests. 

### Create a Registry Furniture Fund

If you know you'll need furniture but you're not quite sure which pieces you want just yet, consider creating a cash fund that your guests can contribute to. You can set this up on [The Knot Registry Store](https://www.theknot.com/registry) as well, and include [wording on your wedding registry](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-registry-wording) that indicates you'd like money to put toward furniture. Most guests love knowing their gift money is going to be put toward something you really want and need, while others can still opt to give a physical gift if they choose. 

### Register at a Furniture Store

One of our favorite [wedding registry gift ideas](https://www.theknot.com/content/best-wedding-registry-ideas), if you're solely focused on receiving furniture, is to set up a furniture store wedding registry. We've included some great options here.

  * **Nebraska Furniture Mart wedding registry** : This large online furniture store offers a host of furniture, as well as items like dinnerware and even a laptop computer! You can create a registry to have guests fund a particular item or chip in toward a general fund that allows you to choose the items you want most. 
  * **Ashley Furniture wedding registry** : This popular furniture store offers a variety of trendy furniture items with a modern, minimalistic vibe. The store offers a cash-based registry where guests can contribute to your furniture fund, rather than purchasing a particular item. Generous financing makes Ashley Furniture a great option for combining your gift amount with your own funds. 
  * **West Elm wedding registry** : Registering at West Elm offers you a variety of chic, modern furniture and home accessories. You'll be able to shop at Pottery Barn and Crate and Barrel when you register at West Elm, and you'll receive a 10% completion discount after your wedding day.



## What Is a Wedding Registry Furniture Fund?

A registry fund is a general fund your guests can contribute to, which you can use to purchase whatever furniture you need. Aside from tons of popular items, large and small, [The Knot Registry Store](https://www.theknot.com/registry) lets you create a custom cash fund so guests can contribute cash as your wedding gift.
