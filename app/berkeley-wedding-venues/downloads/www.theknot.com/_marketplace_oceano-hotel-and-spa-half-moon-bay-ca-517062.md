Not only was the venue gorgeous, but the list of preferred vendors Nancy and Jenn have put together is incredibly helpful and provides a wide variety of options. The hotel staff also made the experience extra amazing - they supported all our guests needs and our needs throughout the weekend and they made the weekend run super smoothly. Could not recommend this place stronger if you are looking for a Bay Area wedding!

de from the beautiful venue and location, Nancy was a huge selling point for us selecting Oceano. What we loved most: \- The flexibility - ability to customize a lot - for example, we brought in pies to be served with cake. They didn’t charge us for people that didn’t end up showing, even though they had RSVPed yes. The hotel block policy is amazing - they hold the inventory for you without having to put a deposit down, and then any rooms not booked a month prior are simply rolled back into inventory. \- The organization - it’s clear that Oceano does weddings, and does them well. \- The value for money - first off, it’s an upscale venue for not all the money in the world. Secondly, what you get when you book with them is so worth it! Includes your typical stuff but then will include a night prior and night of the wedding stay. In addition, Nancy is always trying to find ways for you to SAVE, not spend. We loved, loved, loved Oceano. It such a magical and special place for a wedding.

We love Oceano! We had our fall wedding at Oceano and it could not have been a more beautiful, perfect day. Not only is the venue beautiful and accommodating (our wedding was ~150 ...

guests in the GateHouse, which felt perfect for that room), the staff is truly spectacular. We worked with Nancy to plan the event, meeting with her frequently to iron out every imaginable detail, and it was truly an amazing experience. Nancy and the rest of the team — Lauren, Lucie, Jen — are so experienced and warm to work with, and it's clear that they prioritize the experience of the couples in planning weddings, always making sure that we were on the same page and didn't feel too stressed or frenzied. The day of the wedding, Lauren helped usher and move us through the day — I've heard from other brides at other venues that the wedding day can often seem so stressed and frantic, but I can genuinely say that I was just serenely happy throughout my entire day, mainly due to how calm Lauren and Lucie helped me and my party feel. Guests loved staying in Half Moon Bay and told us that the venue was lovely, warm and elegant — exactly the vibe that we were going for! We would highly recommend Oceano to other couples looking for a beautiful wedding venue with an even more incredible staff. You won't regret it!

I will always hold her close to our heart!!! They have various rooms available for different size events so we decided to host a breakfast buffet the next day in one of their smaller conference rooms. everything was perfect.

Stop looking for the best wedding venue, because this is it. My husband and I booked at the Oceano with Nancy and it was the best decision we ever made. Nancy is incredible. She is...

such a calming presence during a hectic time and handles everything from the moment you book with her to the very last song played perfectly. She is such an amazing sounding board and has been in the industry for so long so knows what is a good idea and what might not flow very well on the day of. I'm honestly at a loss for words trying to explain the perfection of the day at the Oceano. I had two of my best friends planning weddings at the same time and they seemed to run into issue after issue with their venues and we just cruised on into the wedding day with everything we wanted and more. We got married in the wedding garden and had the reception in the gorgeous new gate house. You can see the ocean from both, the pictures turned out incredible, and the venue is VERY flexible with how you want to decorate. They really give you room to be creative and they help as much as they can with your ideas. Looking at venues, I would say these are the top reasons to go with the Oceano: 1\. Nancy - no other wedding coordinator can compete 2\. Location - 50% of our guests were out of state and the Oceano is very close to the airport. Also Half Moon Bay is the perfect vacation place. 3\. They do not charge you if you do not fill the room block (something very common at other venues) 4\. Flexibility - they don't nickle and dime you which is very common in the wedding industry as well. 5\. They set up and clean up - so many of my friends after their weddings asked if we could stay and pick up...it was crazy. Oceano unpacks it all, sets it up beautifully, then packs it all back in. No one lifts a finger. I will tell everyone to get married here until my dying day LOL.

If you are considering have your wedding at the Oceano - DO IT. My husband and I got married at the Oceano and it was the absolute best decision! The venue is beautiful and being...

on the ocean makes it hard to beat. However, it is Nancy (the Oceano's fabulous events planner) and the rest of the staff that made our wedding better than we could have ever imagined. Everyone makes you feel at home there. From our first meeting with Nancy, she eased our early wedding planning anxieties. She spent time answering all of our questions, gave us a tour of their facilities (rooms to use for the events, food, room blocks, decor, etc.) and offered very helpful ideas throughout our conversation. She made us feel so at home and she was genuinely excited for our wedding day. It was so different than any other tour or meeting we'd gone to where we could tell we were just another couple and the venue was just going through their typical wedding meeting (i.e. not special or individual). Nancy truly wanted to make our day special, whatever that meant to us. It was an easy choice for us. Once we confirmed with the Oceano, Nancy was available every step of the way. And since we live in the Bay Area, I met with her a couple of times to review timelines, look at decor, tasting appointment, etc. Every time we met, Nancy's excitement for our day was contagious and made this whole wedding planning thing way more fun than people told me it would be! :) Fast forward to the day of - Nancy and her staff thought of everything. It was the most relaxed experience. She was available all day and stayed through our wedding! She'd connected with all of our other vendors in advance so they day of went very smoothly - everyone knew where they needed to be, etc. And she remembered even the smallest of details that we'd discussed months prior. The food was fabulous and all the guests kept telling me it was the best wedding they'd been to. Bottom line, if you're considering the Oceano for your wedding and have the chance to work with Nancy, you'll be in good hands!!

ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! The entire experience from day 1 was incredible!! We had the most magical, stress free, fun wedding ever! If you are considering having your wedding here... DO ...

IT! We spent months looking for a wedding venue. We wanted something near the ocean and checked the entire coast to find a venue and nothing felt right. Until we found Oceano and were lucky enough to speak with Nancy. Without hesitation she had us come in that day to give us a tour. To describe Nancy as an angel is an understatement... I don't know how we got so lucky to work with her! The hotel has great views of the water and both of the wedding venues are beautiful. One of our biggest pet peeves with venues was the cost of the wedding site because most of the ballrooms weren't that nice; either the carpet was dirty or a crazy color, the chairs were old conference looking chairs, or we had to pay extra money to get drapes to make the room look nice. With Oceano, none of that was necessary! The rooms are beautiful, they already have chiavari chairs ( at no extra cost!) and there is normal carpet (none of that lime green ugly hotel carpet). There wasn't much to spend on decor because you really do get what you pay for. Nancy, was very knowledgeable with the in's and out's of planning a wedding. She listened and addressed all of our concerns and needs and made us feel very comfortable. Here's a few other notes.. Hotel rooms: clean, spacious and well kept The food: Our guests raved about the food! Also everything was organic from their farm! We also had some guests with dietary restrictions which Nancy easy took care of. The staff: Very kind and helpful during the entire planning process. My husband and I were on a budget and one of the things other venues required were day of coordinators. At Oceano, that is not necessary because either Nancy or the other event staff pretty much are your coordinators.. so you do not need to hire someone! From the first day Nancy went over the details with us, helped us with our timeline and planning, and even reached out to our vendors before the wedding to finalize details with them. She was amazing at answering all of our questions and communicating in a very timely manner. To stick to our budget, we also did a lot of DIY decor. Nancy was so gracious to allow us to come early the day before and set up a few things and get everything ready, which was a major help and saved us so much money and time! For our rehearsal, Nancy was there to coordinate and was very calm and helpful ( even with our crazy families who kept getting distracted or asking a bunch of questions). On the wedding day, we had absolutely no stress and no worries because Nancy made us feel so confident that everything was going to run smoothly. She was there every step of the way, she checked in with all of our vendors, she kept us on track and she also made sure we ATE! She saved hors d'oeuvres for us so we can also try them during cocktail hour and brought us plates of food during the wedding and even after! Everything exceeded our expectations and our wedding day was just amazing. Oceano truly checked off all the boxes when picking our wedding venue. Trust me when I say.. BOOK YOUR WEDDING HERE, YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!!!

arly booked out the entire hotel. Nancy N. and her team (along with the entire hotel staff) were extraordinary! Nancy has become my families "Half Moon Bay Mama". She has this amazing energy and ora about her that makes you feel at ease at all times. She helped my family throughout the entire wedding planning process and went above and beyond the day of and the months leading up to the wedding. I cannot thank Nancy enough for everything she did for my wedding and our guests. Going the extra mile- Nancy took my photographer, husband, and myself to nearby beach location to take wedding pictures while our guests sat and ate dinner! The pictures are UNREAL (photographer- IG: @withlovebygeorgie ). If it weren't for Nancy, we wouldn't have such amazing photos to look back on. The wedding was perfect. The guests could not stop talking about how beautiful the venue is, how delicious the food was and how much fun they had at the wedding. I would recommend this hotel to ANYONE looking for an amazing wedding venue, excellent staff, and an amazing wedding planner/coordinator (NANCY, NANCY, NANCY!). Again, I cannot thank Nancy and her team enough. The pictures online do not do the hotel justice. The Oceano Hotel & Spa is a gorgeous venue!! The rooms are amazing and all contain an indoor fireplace & a balcony. I would make an appointment as soon as possible to visit this venue and meet Nancy. You cannot make a wrong choice choosing this venue for a wedding.

g went so smoothly on our special day. Nancy was really helpful with all of the planning. She met with us as often as we needed, and she helped us coordinate with other vendors. They took care of all of the day-of logistics – arranging decorations for the reception, setting up seating for the ceremony, preparing and serving delectable food and drinks throughout the weekend, helping people navigate between the venues, and the list goes on. The communication throughout the process was incredible, and there was such amazing attention to detail. The level of thoughtfulness was beyond expectations. They drove the bride and groom down to the beach site so that we wouldn't spoil the reveal. They made sure we stayed nourished, from the breakfast plate delivered to the bridal suite to the plates of food and cake left for us in the honeymoon suite after the wedding. They transferred luggage from the bridal suite to the honeymoon suite so that we wouldn't have to worry about tracking down our belongings. Our guests raved about the hotel's delicious food, beautiful guest suites, and charming surroundings. The hospitality was absolutely amazing, and they took incredible care of us. The end result was a beautiful, stress-free wedding weekend that we will remember fondly.

Oceano has beautiful facilities for weddings, and they were very responsive while we were in the planning stages of our wedding, but from the rehearsal to the days after, they let ...

us down immensely. My mother-in-law could write pages on what was wrong, or missing from the rehearsal dinner, but that’s her story to tell. With us, they switched out our Coordinator we had worked with for a year for someone else the day before, which caused confusion and too much of us having to explain our plans, we felt that was not a good call on their part. As we came to find out they made lots of these bad calls the day of the wedding. They broke and replaced our sand ceremony vase without telling us, then they didn't safeguard that vase and our sand ceremony spilled out. They ran late the day of the wedding, blamed it on our guests being late, and made us start late which pushed back out wedding photos and resulted in us losing the light for our coastal photo shoot, what a disappointment. They packed up our wedding as it progressed without asking what we wanted done with our favors and décor. We had to ask them to please bring things back out for our guests to take, favors that were specifically there for our guests to take. By the time we went over to look at our gift table and guest tree, they had already been removed. They removed things as they saw fit, our sweets table had stands removed rather than replenished with the extras under the table. Why the rush? The morning after was a shock as we saw our sand ceremony spilling out of a box, I was in tears, and their response to my tears was so blasé; we left them their vase. The room with our belongings was just packed with so much disorder, we delivered everything to them perfectly packed, labeled, and sorted by placement and we got a jumbled mess in return. As we would come to find out they didn't even send us home with our wedding cameras, later we would find that they lost 2 of them. When we emailed them about the missing cameras we received a response that said "I'm looking now..." and that was the last we ever heard from Oceano. We had to pay the video company to replace those cameras. Did they make any reparations for what they lost or broke, of course not! This week, 3 months later, as we finally go through my wedding stuff, I am in tears again, broken lanterns, splintered wood, cut table cloths, broken stands, and my ribbon curtains that we delivered to them with such care are a big tangled mess of ribbon, lights and shells. It's as if they just dumped stuff in boxes and called it a day. I opened a bag and cut my fingers as I found the broken shards of our original monogrammed sand ceremony vase they broke and placed in a grocery store bag... Our wedding was gorgeous; don't get me wrong, but Oceano upset us in ways we couldn't have imagined. We are appalled by their disregard of our belongings, they should be ashamed.

We just had our wedding here a couple of weeks ago and it was great! We chose the Garden and the Gate House. I cannot say enough about Jenn and Nancy in helping us plan our event...

and making sure everything ran smoothly on the day of. They really do just want you to arrive and leave the rest up to them. While this was a little over our budget, it was totally worth it! The food was amazing, I never had anyone say as many nice things about the food at other weddings. They were also able to accommodate some special food requests. They also have a good selection of wine and beer, anything we wanted, they could get! We used the standard linens and table ware which looked great. The venue has so many great places for photos as well. They also really take care of you- we had food waiting in our suite for us after the reception--enough said!

coordinating, paying attention to every little detail to ensure that our special day was the best it could possibly be. From the oceanside ambiance and delicious food, to the hotel guest rooms and friendly staff, our guests couldn't stop raving about Oceano. The prices are reasonable and the service is worth every penny. I highly recommend considering Oceano if you are looking for a Bay Area venue.

We worked with Nancy at Oceano and she was wonderful, along with all the staff there! From day one, Nancy amazing. She really cares about making sure that the wedding day goes th...

e way that you want it to go. Clearly, she has done many weddings. She was great with providing us with ideas or things to think about so that we could add personal touches to our wedding. Planning with Nancy was always fun and she was very good at responding to emails along with phone calls. Before the wedding, Nancy provided us with a tasting and the day of food was spot on! She allowed us to basically build our own dinner menu -- we got to call the shots on what ingredients we wanted in our own food and the chefs at Oceano just put it all together and made it super tasty. We went with the vendors that Nancy recommended and they were all amazing. I think it is important to work with vendors that know the place since they've worked with each other and know how to keep the wedding day running smooth. But, Nancy is very flexible and was pretty much willing to work with new vendors (our photobooth and dessert lady were new to Oceano), but we went with her recommended photographer and DJ. For the rehearsal, we basically had no idea how it should be run, but Nancy did (thank goodness)! Though rehearsal was short, it made our whole wedding party very comfortable about how the day of proceedings would go. For the day of, it was also very smooth. Nancy provided the girls with a bridal suite to get ready in. The room is huge and it's very pretty/rustic looking (which makes for great photography shots). Because it is so spacy, multiple people can get ready at the same time. Nancy would call our bridal suite occasionally to check in if any of the girls needed anything. She also provided the bridal party with lunch. When it came time for the ceremony, the Oceano staff came to our room, helped pack our bags and moved them to a different room and basically escorted us down to the ceremony site. Right before we all walked down the aisle, the staff was there to hold onto our phones and purses which they later returned to us very promptly (basically...we didn't have to worry about a thing, they knew what they were doing)! The ceremony site was so beautiful. The backdrop of the trees and the harbor are very serene and make for great photos. We ended up having about 170 guests and they all sat very comfortably at the ceremony site. We had two handicaps and Oceano was able to accommodate them and help them feel comfortable. One other thing about Oceano is that they have quite a few leftover decorations that Nancy will let you use. We ended up using her shepherd hooks and used fresh flowers to line the aisle of the ceremony site. Cocktail hour food was delicious and everyone enjoyed being in the atrium where there is natural sunlight that fills the room. We had our reception in the ballroom which was beautifully decorated. All the details that we had discussed with Nancy were carried out. Nancy was able to project our powerpoint slideshow and let us play sounds with the powerpoint slideshow and it went perfectly. Nancy and her staff actually ended up plating our dessert and arranged it very beautifully. The alcohol package is flexible. We had extra food waiting in our honeymoon suite at the end of the night in case we were starving! Everyone at Oceano was just so thoughtful and made our wedding day so smooth and fun!

oking to the big day, I couldn't have asked for anything better. The venue is entirely accomodating and super flexible. They say YES to almost anything you ask for. They have items you can borrow and use for decor. I used their centerpieces and saved us a chunk of change. Jennifer was incredibly responsive, professional and sweet. Our wedding ended up being the best day ever, there wasn't a thing we would have changed and I feel we owe a lot of that to the accomodations and service at the Oceano.

I am so happy with how our reception turned out. It was a lot of work on my part but Nancy was always there for me to cry on her shoulder. Little things were over looked and I wish...

we could have had more time (we happily would have paid to keep the party going) but over all it was a dream! The food was delicious, but instead of my plate being brought to my room when I couldn't finish, it was thrown out and there was a sandwich waiting for me instead. I don't know what cocktail hour food was given but in our room there were some things I know we didn't request food wise...but ultimately those little touches really don't put a damper on the experience when I think about how beautiful our tables looked and how much fun everyone was having! The slide show didn't go as planned and it was a bit chaotic as far as when things were supposed to happen, our best man kept asking me which was annoying because I had given everyone a detailed itinerary...but maybe thats just him and Nancy didn't bother me because she already knew. I don't really know, I just didn't like when the lights went out for the slide show and basically stopped the party. I think everything else went so well though...if there were other hiccups, I didn't know about them which is the way it should be!

bsolutely gorgeous but what makes this place special is the people who work there! Jenn and Nancy are so wonderful and they genuinely care about each bride and making all of their wedding dreams come true. Everything I asked for they said yes to and if they didn't know how they would do it they found a way :). I remember when I first met with Jenn I told her how I thought it would be so cool to have a s'mores pit outside during the reception and she informed me they hadn't done that before that they would buy a fire pit and set it up for me. They did this on practically everything I asked for, I wanted a cookie bar where all of my family members brought different cookies and they set up a bunch of different jars and platters and so all I needed to do was have my family drop off the cookies. Oceano was the best wedding venue and I couldn't be happier with my wedding and the venue I chose.

We are so happy that we got married at Oceano Hotel & Spa. We had a garden ceremony and a reception in the Grand Ballroom. The only thing about having an outdoor wedding here is th...

at the weather is so unpredictable, being by the coast and all. Another reason we went with Oceano is that they didn't require a minimum guest count, which we were struggling with because we had less than 100 and most places want 150-200 minimum. We tried our best to pick a day in September but it was a bit chilly on the day of. Even if there is overcast, it does make for more flattering pictures. This hotel has a great beach/ocean theme that's not cheesy at all. The Grand Ballroom was already beautiful with nice big chandeliers so it didn't need draping. The bridal suite had ample room and a perfect view of the harbor. The event coordinator we worked with was Jennifer who was very friendly and responsive to our inquires. The food was excellent. They also had 2 bedroom Villas that most of guests were thrilled with. Overall, it's a great idea to have a wedding here. The guests love the little getaway feel when it's only 30 min from a major highway.

We got married at the Oceano in August (ceremony outside and reception in the tent), and it was amazing! We live in Chicago, so planning a wedding from far away was a bit daunting...

, especially since we only went once to do a tasting and meet with vendors. Nancy was our event coordinator, and I can't say enough good things about her! She went above and beyond to work with us and help us get everything we wanted. When people have asked us how our wedding was, I tell them all how wonderful it was and how it truly exceeded our expectations. That was in large part due to Nancy and her work. I don't know any other event coordinators (which you aren't paying for) that will drive you to the beach with your photographer so you can get pictures, but Nancy did! She helped us with all the details, large and small. I HIGHLY recommend Nancy, and the Oceano!

The folks at Oceano are true pros. They perform a couple of weddings pretty much every weekend, and it shows. Our coordinator, Nancy, was amazing. (Oceano provides an in-house coor...

dinator to handle many of your needs other than outside vendors.) Every time I asked, "But what about..." the answer almost always was, "We handle that - don't worry about it!" (BTW - the cost I chose was for everything we paid to Oceano - ceremony, reception, etc.). For just the ceremony, it's in the "$5000 or less" category.) Here are a few specific reasons why we loved having our wedding at the Oceano: \- Convenience: ceremony, reception, hotel, bar all in one spot. \- Villas: Oceano has a wing of 11 or so villas (large suites). If having a particularly social wedding is important to you, this is perfect. My husband had his bachelor party there the Wednesday before the wedding, and folks had parties in villas on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday night. It was a great way to get some quality time in with friends that we hadn't see in a while, since it's tough to do so during the wedding. \- Food: The food is actually good. You have to go through the hotel, but you can tell it's made with much more TLC than the typical hotel fare, so we didn't mind at all. \- Sustainability: It's a big part of their image as a hotel. For example, their menu is determined by what comes out of their own farm, located next door to the hotel. Very local and very fresh. They also employ sustainable practices in operating their hotel. This was important to us. \- They do things for you: Seriously. They saved us $100 off of our cupcake setup fee when I learned that her staff sets it up for you at no charge. They hung up and arranged all of our decorations, including the paper lanterns in the tent. That must have taken forever... \- Saving money on decor: They have a lot of in-house decorations that they encourage you to use, many of which left to Oceano by past weddings as a thank-you. We saved thousands by using the house centerpieces, and their photo stands, linens, and other decorations. Minimal floral needs here! \- Nancy: She was just amazing. She made us feel so special - even though she was constantly juggling many weddings at once, she always manages to make you feel like yours is the only one she's working on! With Nancy running the show, you really do know that your special day is in good hands.
