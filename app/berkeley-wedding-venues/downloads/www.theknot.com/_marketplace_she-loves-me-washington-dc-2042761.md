Holley and her team are amazing! From the beginning when we saw their proposal, they totally got our winter wedding vibe. Throughout the process we loved working with them and were...

especially grateful when we had to move the ceremony inside with less than 24 hrs notice. They added some candles and still made the space so beautiful even thought it wasn’t the original plan. I’ve used them to send friends flowers for birthdays and they’re just as wonderful for every day flowers too!

She Loves Me and their incredible team, led by Holley, transformed our floral dreams into breathtaking reality for both our flower shower and wedding day! From the very beginning,...

Holley's creativity and enthusiasm shone through. She listened intently to our vision and offered innovative suggestions that elevated our ideas even further. Her ability to think outside the box and incorporate unique elements made our floral arrangements truly one-of-a-kind. The flower shower was a huge success, thanks to She Loves Me. They provided beautiful, high-quality blooms that allowed our guests to create stunning arrangements. It was such a special and memorable pre-wedding activity that set the tone for the celebrations to come. On our wedding day, the floral designs exceeded all expectations. Each arrangement was a work of art. The attention to detail was impeccable, and the way they balanced colors and textures created a cohesive, magical atmosphere throughout our venue. What truly sets She Loves Me apart is not just their artistic talent, but also their professionalism and reliability. Holley and her team were always responsive, flexible, and went above and beyond to ensure everything was perfect. If you're looking for a florist who can take your floral dreams and turn them into a stunning reality, look no further than She Loves Me. They don't just create flower arrangements; they craft unforgettable experiences. Thank you, Holley and the entire She Loves Me team, for making our wedding and flower shower so incredibly beautiful!

I am so grateful that She Loves Me has their Forever Yours à la carte collection. Since our wedding had under 50 guests and we got married in a well-decorated venue, our floral nee...

ds were fairly small. They gave us exactly what we needed at a reasonable price. They were so friendly and helpful when I connected with their team through the website with a few questions. It made us so happy to be able to use a florist that has locally grown flowers and is woman-owned. Not to mention that their flowers are beautiful!

ughout the whole process. The flowers on the day of were exactly what I had imagined and more. Holley and team created a floral chuppah for us that was completely enchanting, wild, colorful, and romantic. Not to mention the most gorgeous bouquets and arrangements. A wonderful experience through and through.

She Loves Me (Holley) was INCREDIBLE. First and foremost, the flowers were stunning. Holley was totally down with us doing something a little different (incorporating citrus fruits...

and veggies) and made everything look spectacular. My bouquet was bright and flowing, a complete show-stopper. I am actually having it preserved because I loved it so much (which I wasn't planning on before I was just so impressed once I saw it in real life). Besides her gorgeous, bright, fun design, Holley and her team were a dream to work with. Cannot recommend She Loves Me highly enough!

The florals for our wedding were such a dream, I can't thank She Loves Me enough! Holley was really responsive during the planning process and lovingly was able to put my ideas for...

color and florals into a detailed plan for the day. Her experience in not only wedding florals in general but specific experience with the Line gave me confidence that the many floral details would be considered even if I didn't think of them myself. I loved the She Loves Me artistic style and the importance placed on local farmers and in-season flowers. The team delivered the personal flowers and installed the decor pieces, and even set aside the flowers that would eventually go on the cake to be used in the detail photographs prior to the ceremony. Definitely recommend!

We picked She Loves Me before we were even engaged. That sounds crazy I know--but the moment I first walked in to the She Loves Me shop in DC, I just knew I had to have them do our...

wedding florals. Let me tell you, they went absolutely above and beyond our wildest dreams! From start to finish, Holley and her team were amazing to work with. They saw our vision, engaged their own creative magic, and brought that vision to life. Their planning, communication and execution were flawless. We truly cannot say enough good things about this team!

ssful process. She answered my late-night emails when I wanted to make small changes without complaint and was just an all-around joy. On our wedding day, my husband and I were totally blown away by the work done by her and her team - it was more than we anticipated! 10/10 experience, loved every second. Would absolutely recommend Holley and her team to any couples on the hunt for a florist in the DC area!!

She Loves Me absolutely NAILED my flowers for our wedding. Like everyone else in 2020, we cancelled our big out of town wedding and opted for a ten person event in DC instead. Thi...

s meant I had to pull together a new wedding in two months from scratch. I went with She Loves Me because of their “Forever Yours” collection, which caters specifically to small events. The benefit of the package was that it wasn’t full service (which they also have) and it fit my needs perfectly for our small wedding. I just wanted a bouquet, a corsage, and a few flowers and garland to decorate the dining table, which they were easily able to accommodate. They have a minimum of $300, which was totally manageable compared to other vendors, who quoted over $1,000. Since we weren’t doing the big event, I really liked the option to cater specifically to our small event. The “Forever Yours” option has three color palettes you can mix and match. We went with the Majorelle (wildflower style) and it was truly stunning. Because they use local and in-season flowers, I didn’t know exactly how my bouquet would look until we picked it up, but it turned out really well. I’ve already gotten comments from my photo previews on how stunning the flowers looked. The bouquet looked a bit smaller in person than I initially thought it would be, but because it was so well done, it actually looked like a larger bouquet in the photos. Plus, it was just straight up gorgeous and hit the vibe I wanted perfectly. Nicole was really easy to work with and the team had everything ready for me when they said it would be ready. Plus they are located in Petworth, so local and super easy to get to for pick up if needed. If you are planning on a smaller wedding, I highly recommend them!
