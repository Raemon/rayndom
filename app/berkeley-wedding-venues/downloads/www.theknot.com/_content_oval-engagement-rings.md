Though recent celebs have gotten engaged with marquise-shaped stones, radiant cuts and one very particular old mine cut diamond, there's one shape that remains a classic: the oval. Oval engagement rings simply never go out of style because they are timeless and sophisticated—think old-money vibes. 

"Oval diamonds are still very popular," confirms Blake Asaad, the founder and creative director of [Goodstone](https://www.goodstoneinc.com/). "While other shapes are trending right now, ovals remain the safest non-round choice that most brides make. They're the epitome of classic sparkle." Here, we dive into all the need-to-knows about an oval diamond engagement ring: what it is, how much it costs and especially where to shop for a unique one.

## What Is an Oval Engagement Ring? 

"An oval is an elongated diamond," Asaad explains. "The way I think about oval-shaped diamonds is that they're elongated versions of round diamonds. So, if you like the look and sparkle of a round diamond but prefer something more elongated, I think an oval is a great option."

Not all oval diamonds are created equal; some are longer and thinner, others are shorter and rounder, closer to a round diamond. "I personally prefer ovals with higher length-to-width ratios for a little extra elongation," Asaad says. And then there's the moval-shaped diamond, a cross between marquise and oval. 

## How Much Does an Oval Engagement Ring Cost? 

Round brilliant is typically the most expensive cut of diamond: It's high in demand, has unmatched brilliance and is created through a labor-intensive process by a highly skilled artisan. Ovals are a stellar alternative; they're still pricey, but slightly more cost-effective than a round brilliant. "I personally believe ovals are a great value because they're one of the most sparkly shapes," Asaad says. "As long as you're getting an excellent oval cut, you'll have a diamond that sparkles for the rest of your life and beyond. Definitely one of the best in terms of bang for your buck." 

The price of any diamond is determined by the 4 Cs: cut, clarity, color and carat. (With this particular [diamond shape](https://www.theknot.com/content/brilliant-tips-how-to-choose-a-diamond-shape), Asaad recommends prioritizing cut—and remember, ovals tend to look slightly larger than their carat count thanks to the elongated shape.) A brand name can also affect the cost of a diamond or engagement ring. Pieces from well-known jewelry labels tend to come with a higher price tag. 

Maybe the biggest factor affecting cost is the distinction between natural and lab diamonds. "When it comes to natural diamonds, ovals tend to be on the higher side of the price range," Asaad says. "But when it comes to lab-grown diamonds, they're very price-competitive and affordable." (More good news: Ovals look great on a clean metal band, so you may be able to save on the [engagement ring setting](https://www.theknot.com/content/engagement-ring-settings-101), too.) 

Let's look at some examples. A lab-grown two-carat oval engagement ring on a simple 18k gold band from [HauteCarat](https://hautecarat.com/products/oval-cut-diamond-ring?variant=46649284362496) rings in at $4,800. A similarly set oval solitaire featuring a natural diamond from Brilliant Earth will run anywhere from $12,000 to $23,000 and beyond, depending on the color and clarity. 

## Bands for Oval Engagement Rings 

An oval engagement ring doesn't come with many qualifiers about what type of band it can be set on. Instead, it's all about preference and whether or not you want to follow [engagement ring trends](https://www.theknot.com/content/engagement-ring-trends) (for example, wider bands are trending, so a yellow gold oval engagement ring on a 4mm band would be very of-the-moment). 

A timeless choice is clean and classic—and it works particularly well for ovals. "Ovals sparkle a lot, so they typically don't need many supporting diamonds to look great," Asaad says. "Anything streamlined and elegant works beautifully for an oval; you don't need a lot of pavé to support it." 

A clean band lets the oval do all the talking, but if you're looking for more unique oval engagement rings, look for twisted metal bands, two-tone metals in the band and [engagement ring prongs](https://www.theknot.com/content/engagement-ring-prongs), a knife-edge band, or even an oval bezel engagement ring. All these options keep the band to metal only, but add an element of interest. 

Of course, if your heart is set on bling, that's always an option too. Opt for a three-stone or oval halo engagement ring, or choose a pavé or eternity band. 

## Where to Shop for Oval Engagement Rings 

Being that it's one of the most classic shapes, you'll find oval diamond engagement rings at just about every jeweler on the map (find a jeweler near you in [The Knot Vendor Marketplace](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/jewelers)). But our five picks below stand out, whether for their wide variety, the unique types of oval engagement rings they offer, or their design or pricing structures. 

[**Goodstone**](https://www.goodstoneinc.com/collections/oval-cut): You'll find unique, modern takes on the classic oval solitaire engagement ring here. "Goodstone's aesthetic is very diamond-centric; all of our rings are designed to let the center stone shine," Asaad says. "We design for brides who have unique, curious taste—those who don't want a ring that looks like their mom's or their friends'." One of the jeweler's most popular engagement rings is the [Triad](https://www.goodstoneinc.com/products/triad-ring-with-oval-cut), a three-stone engagement ring with a trio of generously sized oval-shaped diamonds.

[**HauteCarat**](https://hautecarat.com/collections/lab-grown-diamond-engagement-rings/shape_oval): Since oval-shaped engagement rings can be on the pricier side—especially if you're envisioning a large or flawless stone—lab diamonds are a great option. HauteCarat is one of our go-tos for lab-grown oval engagement rings. The jeweler has a storefront in Chicago and a robust e-commerce site and offers both classic, simple oval engagement rings and more unique versions, like a [step-cut east-west design](https://hautecarat.com/collections/lab-grown-diamond-engagement-rings/products/step-cut-oval-engagement-ring). 

[**Sarah O.**](https://www.sarahojewelry.com/collections/engagement-rings/shape-oval#!tags=shape-oval): If your aesthetic calls for more vintage oval engagement rings, check out this woman- and Latina-owned jeweler. Many of her designs have an art-deco twist (like the [Harlem](https://www.sarahojewelry.com/products/mto-the-mini-harlem-oval-ring?collection=engagement-rings#!sku=210000009332https://www.sarahojewelry.com/products/mto-the-harlem-oval-ring?collection=engagement-rings#!sku=210000008122)), or are set on dainty bands that read romantic and old-school. True to its brand, the jeweler also works with clients to rework heirloom diamonds or gemstones into new [custom engagement rings](https://www.theknot.com/content/custom-engagement-ring-design-101). 

[**Kimai**](https://kimai.com/engagement-rings/)**:** For unique, organic-feeling takes on the classic stone, check out LA-based Kimai, whose offerings include a cool [east-west oval engagement ring](https://kimai.com/engagement-rings/camilla-band/), bulbous [Golda](https://kimai.com/engagement-rings/golda/) ring and the twisted pave [Billie](https://kimai.com/engagement-rings/the-billie-pave-ring/) ring. Kimai is committed to providing ethical pieces, using exclusively recycled solid 18k gold and lab-grown diamonds. Every ring is made to order, and the jeweler also offers a bespoke service. 

[**James Allen**](https://www.jamesallen.com/engagement-rings/preset/?a_aid=5c3367062612e&a_cid=dfef9309&chan=TKEditorial&data1=TK-oval-engagement-rings): James Allen is a classic jeweler with a customizable twist: Customers can design rings right on the website, starting by [choosing the exact diamond](https://www.jamesallen.com/loose-diamonds/all-diamonds/?a_aid=5c3367062612e&a_cid=dfef9309&chan=TKEditorial&data1=TK-oval-engagement-rings) they want to set, toggling [the 4 Cs](https://www.theknot.com/content/engagement-ring-diamond-grading) to find the perfect natural or lab-grown stone, then choosing their preferred metal, setting and more. The jeweler also offers a selection of ready-to-ship oval engagement rings.
