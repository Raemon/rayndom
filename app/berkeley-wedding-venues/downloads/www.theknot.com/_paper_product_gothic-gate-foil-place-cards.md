Details

Displayed like an antique engraving, your guest's name graces your place card in an elegant gothic-inspired font. An understated, ornate foiled design crowns the top in keeping with your suite's dramatic theme. Select how many cards you would like printed, and after you've placed your order, a designer will send you a spreadsheet to fill out your guests' names here. After you've placed your order, send your completed spreadsheet to help@theknot.com with your order number included in your email, and a designer will send you a digital proof of all of your cards before printing. A variety of meal icons are now available! If you would like to include meal info on your place cards, simply enter your guests' meal choices to your spreadsheet, ordered by meal preference - and our designers will include them in your digital proofs.
