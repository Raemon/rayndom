d my hotel was in Tiburon. I was worried about finding the right MUA that would be able to plan for an early start time (5:30 am), but Nia was incredibly accommodating, flexible with last minute changes, and truly cared about me and my bridal party. I trusted her completely with my wedding hair and look (we did 2 trials) and my bridesmaids also loved her. She’s competitively priced, very responsive, and a joy to work with. Thank you so much Nia, I definitely recommend Beyond Beauty for your wedding hair & makeup needs!

I recently had the pleasure of working with a Beyond Beauty for my wedding day, and I couldn't be happier with the results. From the initial consultation to the final touch-ups, sh...

e was professional, friendly, and truly talented at her craft. Hair: She took the time to listen to my ideas and offered suggestions based on my hair type and the style of my dress. The end result was a beautifully intricate updo that stayed in place all night long, despite dancing and celebrating with my guests. Makeup: She was equally skilled, using high-quality products and techniques to enhance my natural features and create a stunning bridal look. She was patient and attentive to detail, making sure that I was completely satisfied with every aspect of my makeup before leaving for the ceremony. Overall, I would highly recommend Beyond Beauty to anyone looking for a professional, talented, and friendly hair & makeup artist for their wedding day. She truly made me feel like a beautiful and confident bride, and I am so grateful for her services!

ids' and my mother-in-law's hair and makeup on the big day. Everyone's hair and makeup lasted the entire day- we got married on a warm, sunny day in September and didn't experience any makeup sweating off. Nia was very accommodating and picked up hair extensions for me to achieve the wedding hair look I was looking for. My hair has a hard time holding a curl and volume- but my hair held the entire night!! The curls were still holding strong the next morning after sleeping! I also love the foundation she used- there was no creasing on my face. I felt like a beautiful bride and I was very happy working with Nia! :)

ss on the trial and book a session for our engagement photos. I was reasonably pleased with my makeup and decided maybe we had a miscommunication about my hair. Since it was too late to make a change, I made the best of it and thank goodness our photographer got some great photos. After that experience I booked a trial for the wedding to be sure we were on the same page. Again I tried to make the best of it, but my hair was a disaster! I showed her photos and attempted to redirect. I wish I could attach the photos here! When she saw I was upset she tried to argue that the style might not be possible with my hair. Trying to work through it I returned home and redid the hairstyle myself to share photos with my hair. She made no attempt to problem solve or reassure me. When I finally cancelled, she literally replied "no worries" but despite the month of advanced warning and all my efforts to work through things she still refused to refund my deposit. So disappointing. If you want anything other than the simplest hair style, stay away! Praying I can find someone better in time and hoping it will be a funny story some day. Update - since I posted my review, I found a wonderful new vendor and Nia provided a refund.

s, and she made the process of the big day go by so smoothly. My makeup lasted the entire night, and didn’t feel heavy or cakey at all, despite a more dramatic makeup look. I completely trusted her to do my bridal party’s hair and makeup, as well as my mom and MIL. Everyone felt so spectacular and their makeup and hair lasted after hours of dancing! I would go to Nia again in a heartbeat for more makeup and hair styling services!

I had an appointment with Nia this past Saturday. I'm having a destination wedding so I wanted to get the right look and learn to apply it myself, since it's a risk trying someone ...

new right on wedding day. The makeup lesson was so much fun! Nia is professional, warm and friendly, and really encouraging! Going in I felt kind of awkward because my makeup application skills are so rudimentary (and sometimes makeup people can be a little snobby?) but Nia was the opposite and made me feel really comfortable and I was completely at ease. I felt pampered! My friends were wowed by the result and said I look "so beautiful, and just like you but heightened" which is exactly what I wanted. Not overdone, yet glamorous and elegant. We used my own blush and eyebrow pencil, and different products for the rest, which made sense to me because I was going for a wedding-day look and my own makeup products are for everyday in terms of color, etc. There was no pressure to buy anything. I highly recommend making an appointment with Nia! My eyes in particular have never looked better!

As a Bride, I have to say that Nia is the best make up artist I've ever had the chance to work with.She's one of those people who has talent she was born with and she perfected tha...

t by educating herself and mastering her craft. The precision she works with is unbelievable. This is crucial in makeup. A lot of people can learn how to do make up but not everyone will have that natural talent and passion for it. I love that she always gets my vision. I tell her what I'm looking for and she brings her own ideas and character into it. That's exactly what I'm looking for when I hire a makeup artist. Nia is very easy to work with, there is no drama, no wasting of time, just focusing on creating outstanding work and having a great time. On a personal level, I just adore her, she is always the funniest and most entertaining person on the team. If you're still reading this, you can stop looking. You just found the right person for the job. ;) 💗💗💗

I can't say enough great things about my experience with Nia regarding my wedding hair and makeup trial. For months I was undecided on what look I wanted and really spent hours ...

stressing over it. I didnt want "natural" nor did I want un-natural. I was having a hard time with the updos because I have long hair and never wear my hair up. It doesn't look like me and I don't feel beautiful with my hair up. I read a lot of great reviews about Nia and decided to reach out through Yelp. Nia promptly responded and provided clear cut information about the services, so I booked my trial. Nia welcomed my fiance' and myself in and I was super at ease talking to her and showing her my inspiration pictures. Nia’s personality is delightful and she is so full of radiant energy, which is what I want on my wedding day! When I saw myself in the mirror, it was like all the stress and worry melted away. I truly felt so beautiful and glamorous! I do wear makeup but it is NOT the same as having it airbrushed and done by a Professional. The look on my fiancés face (that "wow" moment) when he saw me made my eyes tear up but my makeup stayed put. Nia got the perfect look for me and it was exactly what I wanted on the first try. I spent the rest of my day walking around San Francisco and went out at night and my hair and makeup still looked beautiful. I am now looking forward to my wedding day with confidence. Thank you Nia! I highly recommend Nia and her sweet positive energy.

at a specific time. She is so easy and fun to talk to! I truly enjoyed her company and knew I was in good hands. She has hands of MAGIC. All my looks were insane. I was the more simple bride but she made simple look too good. She did everything I asked without hesitation. My makeup stayed in the 95 degree summer heat without budging. As for my hair, I took a risk and did things I would of never thought of doing. The amount of compliments I got throughout my wedding was enormous. I wouldn't recommend anyone else. Nia is the absolute best and my go-to makeup artist for absolutely anything. Thank you a million Nia for everything you did for me!!!

up for several family members. She also did my hair and makeup for a photoshoot I did a few days after the wedding. Several things I appreciated about Nia: \- She was very professional and organized \- She took her time with the hair trial, making sure I was happy with the way it was looking \- The day of the wedding, she arrived on time and stayed on schedule \- She was easy to work with and answered my emails promptly \- She can do a variety of styles (for makeup she can do more traditional and natural looks as well as more dramatic looks). She also does the airbrushing makeup, which looked so good! \- She worked with the ideas that I had for my hair but also had good suggestions on how she thought my hair would look the best (we did a style of my choosing for the wedding day, then I let her do whatever she wanted for my photo session and both hairstyles received a lot of compliments) I would highly recommend Nia to anyone looking for a talented hair/makeup artist in the Bay Area.

Nia is by far the most amazing makeup artist I have ever met. A friend of mine had recommended me to her and after I did my trial run I was sold. I've been trying to emulate the ...

job she did ever since! What I like best about her work is that she makes you look your absolute best without looking overly made up. Not only that, but the makeup lasted through the 8 hours of our wedding and even the next morning (I was too tired to take it off the night of the wedding). It is very rare to find a makeup artist that not only your bridesmaids love, but one your mother and grandmother approve of as well. Nia did just this. I feel like at every wedding I go to, someone is taking their makeup off or adjusting it. No one did that with Nia, because everyone loved what she did. She even got through everyone before we needed to be done, which was great for the day of timeline! I cannot recommend Nia strongly enough and am eternally grateful for my friend who recommended her and the work she did for my wedding. I will most definitely be utilizing her services in the future and you should too!

an female who hadn't the faintest clue about most makeup procedures. I'm a plain Jane who loves her lip gloss. While most girls experimented in their preteens and teenage years, I was about to embark on a new adventure in my 30s. Finding a makeup artist professional was a last minute decision. They say you only get married once, so you might as well look your very best for your BIG day! WORKING TOGETHER (IN 2020): As the other reviewers have said, Nia was professional, affordable, responsive, knowledgeable and most of all T-A-L-E-N-T-E-D! Nia is skilled in her craft and truly listens to her customers. My initial contact with Nia was 10 days before my wedding date! YES, ONLY 10! We arranged to have my trial run five days before I tied the knot. I was pleased with my hair and makeup trial run, therefore booked Nia for my wedding day. All went smoothly on my wedding day and I loved her services so much that I booked another makeup session a month later. Nia helped me achieve what I wanted for two different grand events! She's my go-to gal when I want to look and feel beyond beautiful! A quick tip for those feeling nervous or hesitant: you'll never know unless you try.

Nia was amazing. I was referred to her by a friend after I was having a difficult time finding a local makeup and hair stylist. We did my trial at her apartment which was easy and ...

convenient. I was SO pleased with my trial as was my fiancé! As our wedding date approached, she was very communicative and flexible. I say flexible because I had a somewhat indecisive family members who wanted services, and then changed their mind- a couple times. Nia was always easy and accommodating and on the day of, so many of my family members LOVED her work so much, she and her "team" (Mom and Sister- and they were just as talented as her) stayed longer than planned and did hair and makeup on additional ladies. All together, she did me, 5 of my 7 bridesmaids, my Mom, my MIL, three Aunts and my little cousin. All of us looked amazing and I have never felt so beautiful and glamorous. If you are looking for a talented, easy to work with, affordable stylist, I can't recommend anyone more highly. For my next special occasion, I will be calling Nia.

hly recommend a trial--I had a destination wedding and scheduled a trial a couple days before the big day), and then she encouraged me to share my thoughts and then adjusted my make-up until it was perfect. I ended up with a pouty, bright red lip and smoky eyes--I loved it! My bridesmaids loved their looks, and she did wonders with my mom, who had damaged hair from a perm gone awry. She's also got a great personality for working with brides and bridal parties. She's calm, knowledgeable and patient, without being patronizing or demanding, and she and her assistant were just great to hang out with. I couldn't have imagined a better "getting ready" experience. And I felt beautiful! Many thanks, NIA!!! You are good people. I highly recommend her for any occasion.
