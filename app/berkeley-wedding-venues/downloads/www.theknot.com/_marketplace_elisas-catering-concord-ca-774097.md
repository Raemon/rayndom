Delicious Food and Seamless Service – Perfect Farewell Brunch! We hired Elisa’s Catering for our Farewell Brunch the day after our wedding, and they did an absolutely fantastic jo...

b! I worked with Juan, who made the entire process incredibly easy and stress-free. He provided a clear menu of options with straightforward pricing and quantities, and was always quick to respond to any questions I had. The food was delicious—our guests especially raved about the veggie egg casserole and the French toast. Even though our venue didn’t have a kitchen, they prepared everything off-site and delivered it perfectly warm and fresh. You never would have known it hadn’t just come out of the oven! Juan and his team handled everything, from setup to tear-down, and even packaged up the leftovers for us. It was such a relief to not have to worry about a thing that morning, and the value for the quality of service and food was excellent. I highly recommend Elisa’s Catering for any event—reliable, delicious, and a pleasure to work with!

If you have the opportunity to work with Juan, take it! Food is delicious(way better than expensive wedding food that was like airplane food), presentation is A+, logistics are A+ ...

and he's just the best. You will seriously not regret it. Our guests still talk about the food.

Amazing food, amazing service, amazing staff! They were a hit at our wedding! Highly recommend Elisa's Catering and Juan (Owner) for your wedding or event!

We are so happy we chose Juan and his team to be our wedding caterers for our June 2024 wedding at Ruth Bancroft Gardens in Walnut Creek. They have done many weddings here and know...

all the ins and outs of the garden, which was invaluable. They also helped us with all the setup, service, table clearing, breakdown, and cleanup. We started off with a tasting in Concord, and my husband and I were blown away by how delicious everything was. For our wedding, we decided on pork belly steamed buns (my favorite appetizer, a perfect combination of smoky with pickled vegetables), ahi poke tuna cones with lemon avocado puree, and bulgogi chicken skewers with lemon chili kimchi sauce. For our main entrees, we had a stonefruit salad with burrata cheese, roasted salmon with an apricot ginger lime glaze, and rosemary and garlic-crusted prime rib (carving station). We chose garlic noodles (my fave), roasted broccolini, and mashed potatoes (my other fave) for our sides. The food was a hit at our wedding; we received so many compliments, and everyone had enough for seconds. Juan and his team were an absolute delight to work with. They were all so friendly and made our day run smoothly with their excellent service. We highly recommend Elisa's Catering and would love to work with them again in the future for other catering needs.

Juan and Elisa's Catering was the absolute perfect caterer for our wedding! Thank you Juan for going so above and beyond to make the food and drinks at our wedding perfect. First ...

of all – the food was absolutely delicious. Juan made us feel cared for from Day 1 with a special tasting of all the menu items we wanted to try. The food on the day of was exactly what we were hoping for, beautifully presented and so tasty. People especially loved the bulgolgi skewers and the salmon – but it was all so yummy! Second of all – my mom designed really special signature cocktails for us, and Juan had multiple conversations with her about how to make those happen. On the day, the cocktails were a huge hit (I personally had 3... don't worry, 1 of them was a mocktail) and I'm really grateful for Juan and the team for making that special project come through. Finally – The service manager day of was so kind, and she made sure that my husband and I had a full plate of food, and got to try all the appetizers before joining cocktail hour. The service was really incredible. Overall, big A+ for Juan and Elisa's catering!

Quick Summary: We found Elisa's Catering from our wedding venue's list of preferred caterers and we thoroughly enjoyed working with Juan and his team. He's so friendly, humble, acc...

ommodating, very experienced, and his food is great! We were looking for a caterer who could create a family-style Asian-inspired menu and Elisa's Catering was one of the options stood out to us for their sample dishes on their website, customizability, and the reasonable quote. After exchanging emails and a couple phone calls with Juan to confirm our tasting menu, we had a tasting and really enjoyed everything. He has a great eye for presentation, he explained all the dishes well and took all our feedback into account. We loved the pork belly appetizer so much, we turned it into an entreé so we could enjoy more of it! In between our tasting and the wedding day, we got in touch with their preferred event rental company to pick out our linens, dishes, utensils, etc. and Juan handled the rest of the coordination. We were able to adjust the items on our original invoice, like adding a water station, a hot water carafe for our late night DIY instant ramen bar, and having apps served down near the ceremony space instead of the bar area as originally planned to cater to a better guest experience. Juan was gracious and patient through it all. We also really appreciated that he's not out to nickel and dime you and there aren't any hidden charges with him. He's genuinely here to make sure him and his catering team can help make your event the best! On the wedding day, everything seemed to run smoothly and all the team members we spoke to were so friendly. The staff made sure to serve me and my husband first and came back to check if we needed anything. We got so many compliments from our guests raving about the food throughout the day! People especially loved the pork belly and the ahi tuna cone appetizer. At the end of the night, we were given a couple trays of leftovers - a service that not all other caterers provided. We really appreciated this to avoid food waste. Overall, we loved having Elisa's Catering as our food vendor and appreciate them so much!

he food was absolutely delicious. Every dish was a hit with our guests, and we received countless compliments on the flavors and presentation. Chef Juan, in particular, was a delight to work with. He was incredibly kind and accommodating, making sure all our specific requests were met. He even went out of his way to help us with custom rental requests, which made the entire process so much smoother. The service staff also deserves a special mention. They were wonderfully nice, attentive, and efficient. Throughout the event, they made sure everything ran seamlessly, allowing us to enjoy our special day without any worries. Overall, we highly recommend Elisa's Catering. Their professionalism, attention to detail, and fantastic food made our wedding truly memorable.

I genuinely cannot say enough good things about the job Elisa’s Catering did for our wedding! Having a good caterer was one of our biggest priorities and we really hit the jackpot ...

with Juan at Elisa’s Catering! First off, the food was incredibly delicious and interesting! We did tastings at two different caterers, and Elisa’s Catering just blew the other place out of the water. It was delicious, inventive, had flavor and range! It wasn’t just the same old appetizers and options you see at most weddings, so if you’re looking for something exemplary, I highly recommend Elisa’s catering! I mean, it was all so good that over half of our final menu was things we hadn’t even actually tasted, and I was not worried at all! Their prices are extremely reasonable and they’re familiar with and have worked with a ton of the other local vendors for weddings. Many people I talked to at the wedding went out of their way to stress how amazing the food was, and we were overjoyed with the whole thing! Juan also worked with us to handle a somewhat atypical request for a tapas/small plates style buffet, and they all did a great job with it, despite it not being their usual approach. They were very flexible, accepting our requests, giving us advice, and getting it all done. And the buffet also LOOKED amazing! How do you make a huge pile of salad look SO appetizing? I don’t know, but they did it! We also, as requested, were able to take leftovers home, but the estimate of what we’d need was so good that despite there being plenty of food for everyone, we also didn’t have a huge amount of leftovers, which was fantastic! Beyond just the excellent quality of the food, everyone at Elisa’s was a joy to work with. They took care of all rentals, and were in-touch with us before the event, making sure that we had everything squared away. Emails are a good way to communicate, but if you’ve got a lot to chat about, I’d recommend just setting up a phone call. Juan is so kind and friendly and down-to-earth, I was completely comfortable talking on the phone (and I get nervous about phone calls generally). We had a relatively last-minute venue and schedule change due to an emergency building closure, and not only were they extremely helpful and flexible on this front, they even helped us decide on our new venue. Huge recommendation, great people, great food, great planning, 10/10!

our originally venue flooded, Juan worked with us and showed us an alternate venue which ended up being better than the original venue. The day of the wedding, Juan and his team of amazing staff ensured that everything went smoothly. Our guest with dietary restrictions enjoyed their alternative meal & the rest of our guest were raving about the food. We highly recommend Elisa’s Catering for your next event!

Juan and his team catered my wedding in September and I cannot express enough how unbelievably incredible everything was! Our guests are still raving about the food every time the ...

wedding comes up. Not only that, but Juan helped us when we had a last minute venue change and was super accommodating, patient, and extended his support in our time of need. Our venue flooded two weeks before our wedding and he reached out to other vendors to try to help us secure a new venue and was flexible and reassuring throughout that incredibly stressful process. Juan and his team took amazing care of us on our wedding day as well. We never wanted for anything because our cup was always full, plates were quickly offered to us, and they made sure to take excellent care of our guests as well. I can't recommend them enough! Thank you so much Juan!!

Juan and his team catered my wedding this past weekend. To say the food and service was a hit is an understatement! We served family style, which isn't easy. But you couldn't tell!...

Juan and team are very professional. The food tasted amazing, and many of my guests complimented it. He was very flexible and easy to communicate with prior to the wedding. He went above and beyond for us, and I can't thank him enough. Even the winery hosting our event is going to recommend him to others! Well done!
