So I should say that I've known Ron since I was a barfly about 10 years ago. However when I first starter looking for djs for my wedding for some reason he didn't come to mind firs...

t until my best friend reminded me about him. He gave me an initial quote and talked it over with my now husband and we booked him that moment. We went with his dj and photobooth service and it was absolutely perfect. He helped us throw a great party from the beginning of the ceremony to our final song.

We booked Ron from Legend Makers for our wedding on 9-21-19. From start to finish, Ron was excellent at keeping us in communication and making sure we had everything we needed for ...

our special day. The “planner” he emailed us helped us to narrow down the important songs and times that we needed to figure out. On the day of, he arrived early to set up, and throughout the day/night the music was on point. My biggest commendation though is for Ron’s willingness and ability to make sure our day was perfect. The song we chose for our first dance had a line that we didn’t love, and asked him to skip it over. He got back to us with a sample of the edited song, and it was perfect! He really went above and beyond for our wedding day and definitely recommend him!!

enced company. Ron has A LOT of wedding and event experience. He allowed me to choose what to play or not play, MC'd the reception and helped us stay on track with speeches, etc. They get the party going and keep it there with smart music choices, excellent sound quality and allowing guest requests. I've recommended them to 2 other satisfied brides already! Bonus: they also have karaoke if you want to sing or have a karaoke wedding. Double bonus: They are incredibly well priced!!
