rough the day of. We live in Chicago so didn’t get to do a trial, so she showed me along the way so I could provide feedback. While I had a decent amount of makeup on and she put my hair extensions in, I still looked like myself, which was super important to me. I loved how it looked in photographs too. She also did my mom’s makeup and it looked amazing! I’d highly recommend Joanna for your special day!
