Elliot Surrey

Co-Founder

I'm Elliot, born and raised in Los Angeles. I grew up playing baseball and was even good enough to be drafted by the Seattle Mariners and play professionally for a few years. Filmmaking and storytelling has always been a passion of mine, and the fact that I get to both for other people is a dream come true. Not only have I done traditional weddings, but I have been fortunate enough to be able to film some diverse and cultural weddings as well. I love learning about the new traditions that are unique to each couple. Let's chat some more! I'd love to hear about your story and how we can bring it to life.

Chas and Elliot were the absolute BEST videographers we could have asked for to capture not just our wedding day, but also the special moments leading up to it. Their passion for t...

heir craft and the creative ideas they brought to life left us speechless when we watched the final video. Not only are they incredibly talented, but they are also some of the friendliest, most personable people we've ever met. From our first meeting, they made us feel completely at ease. As we were inexperienced with posing and camera presence, Chas and Elliot provided clear guidance and direction, which helped us feel comfortable and confident throughout the entire process. We were also really impressed with their investment in top-notch equipment. It's clear that they use the best gear available to ensure every shot is perfect, and it truly made a difference in the final product. The quality of the footage was incredible, and it showed their commitment to delivering nothing but the best for their clients. A San Jose hidden gem! Highly Recommended with no regrets.

ng video. Their work speaks for itself, and was exactly what we were looking for to make the deal feel alive again. As professionals, the two of them were a delight to work before, during and after the big day. Their communication is prompt, took time to get to know us as a couple, and triple-check to make sure they capture the moments that matter most to us. Thanks for being a part of our day and allowing a piece of it to live on forever.

Picture This Productions is a must for your event! They were easy to communicate with prior to our wedding and really prepped us for what having videographers around would be like ...

so we were able to act natural on the day of. In our wedding video they captured all of my favorite facial expressions my husband makes and definitely took our note that we don't take ourselves too seriously, capturing goofy moments and utilizing the funnier lines of the speeches given at our reception. Our videos are the perfect balance of sincerity and silly moments that defines our relationship, not to mention incredibly cinematic and beautiful. The coloring in particular is amazing - so vibrant and true to the day! We will treasure these videos for the rest of our lives and cannot recommend Picuture This Productions enough!

. I love to go back and watch the video they sent because it is the most beautiful tribute of our special day. They were so professional and easy to work with.

ure This Productions went above and beyond with our wedding and engagement shoot. All the pictures perfectly capture us. What was great was I can be nervous taking pictures and can not always be relaxed. But they helped keep the tone light and fun which allowed me to enjoy the day. There editing is unlike anything else we saw. Every time we watch the videos we are brought back to that day. They were happy to make any adjustments we wanted to make to them even though there were hardly any. This was a great team and we are so happy we found them.
