A bach party is the ultimate rite of passage for any to-be-wed. A chance to throw an(other) epic bash surrounded by your favorite people? Say less. Of course, you want to pull out all the stops, but let's be real: those expenses add up _fast_. According to a [study](https://www.theknot.com/content/bachelorette-party-weekend-cost) by The Knot, the average bach guest shells out around $1,300(!) to attend. But beyond the cost itself, figuring out who's paying for what can be a headache with a capital "H." Keep reading for six tips to slay the planning process. 

## Define the vision and elect a team captain.

First things, first: Figure out your vision for the party. Does it include cowboy boots and line dancing? Or maybe it's something with a little more sitting and sipping. Whatever your vibe is, make sure it's clear. From there, crown your crew leader to make sure all the details make it out of the group chat. This person will basically act as the CFO of the bash, handling things like logistics and checks and balances. What that doesn't mean, however, is that they [cover all the costs](https://www.theknot.com/content/who-pays-for-bachelor-and-bachelorette-parties). 

## Set a budget. 

Real talk: Setting a budget ahead of time ensures everyone is A) on the same page and B) aware of anticipated expenses. Keep in mind, a destination event is generally pricier than a local one (hello, travel and accommodations). To get the (money) ball rolling, survey the squad to get an idea of what everyone is comfortable spending before planning gets too far down the road. Don't forget to consider the cost of things like meals, activities, swag and decorations. Truth be told, everyone's idea of a good time is different, so try to find a happy medium. 

## Find creative ways to save.

When you plan any party—but especially a bach party—it can feel like the costs add up quickly. But you can get creative [on a budget](https://www.theknot.com/content/planning-a-budget-bachelorette-party) and still manage to throw the bash of the century. If travel's part of the plan, scope out hotel group rates before you book, or go for a short-term rental. And don't sleep on those credit card rewards, airline miles and hotel points either! They can easily be turned into free flights, accommodations, meals and even activities. 

## Pitch in to a pot.

Oh, the drama of the post-game settle-up. The thought of cross-referencing charges and receipts is enough to make you want to scrap your plans altogether. This is where [Cash App pools*](https://cash.app/?irclickid=Xli135yoHxycUt6xv43L9x1jUkp3wURxzSlIWM0&ovmtc=12855&utm_source=impact&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=The%20Knot%20Worldwide%20Inc.&utm_content=&utm_term=64733&irgwc=1) becomes your new bestie. Instead of one person fronting the bill and chasing everyone down later, or having the group throw down a rainbow of credit cards at every meal, the group can contribute to a shared fund from the start. Pooling ahead of time helps avoid friction and confusion on top of personal financial risk, so you can focus on the fun. With one tap, you can create a goal, set a target amount and invite contributors to your pool—even if they're not on Cash App, they can add funds using Apple Pay or Google Pay. 

## Keep track of your funds.

Setting and tracking your budget as soon as the details are decided is the best way to crush your financial goal, or tweak it if plans change. With Cash App pools, you have visibility to see who's in (and who might need a gentle reminder to pony up) and how close you are to your target amount. Another benefit that makes everyone's lives easier? You don't need to have a Cash App account to contribute to a pool—other partygoers can chip in via Apple Pay or Google Pay, and there's absolutely no hidden fees. 

## Pay from _one_ place.

Not only does pools save the day (and your friendships) by eliminating the hassle of juggling payment apps, bank accounts, credit cards or even cash, everything is centralized with a single source of payment. What's more, pooled money stays separate from your Cash Balance, so there's no confusion about what it's for. The bottom line: One person can pick up the bar tab or the spa day services, while everyone else stays in the moment, focused on the celebratory fun. 

_For planning the shower to the bach party, Cash App pools will be your wedding party's new favorite tool.
