There’s a certain type of person that lives for the stage. Lives to entertain. Fueled by the smiles and energy of a crowd. Into this tradition steps Mercy & The Heartbeats, a dance band comprised of veteran musicians from some of the most popular and successful dance and touring bands in the Bay Area and beyond.

Collectively, the six members of Mercy have been trusted to share the stage with legendary artists spanning all genres and decades, such as Mark McGrath (Sugar Ray), Bret Michaels (Poison), Coolio, The Sugar Hill Gang, Tone Loc, Steve Harwell (Smash Mouth), Pat Monahan (Train), Lou Gramm (Foreigner), The Black Keys, Digital Underground, Phil Lesh (Grateful Dead), Peter Buck and Mike Mills (R.E.M.), Mickey Thomas (Starship), Garry Beers and Ciaran Gribbin (INXS), Jennifer Holiday (Dreamgirls), Jerry Reed, Mel McDaniels, John Lee Hooker, The Coasters, Malo, Jorge Santana, Ryan Merchant (Capital Cities), Don Ho, Tony Lindsay (Santana), and many more. They’ve performed the national anthem for the Golden State Warriors, San Francisco 49ers, Oakland Raiders, San Jose Sharks, San Jose Earthquakes, and Livermore Rodeo. Their talents have taken them all over the world to entertain everyone from the United States military to the executives and employees of companies big and small (Google, Twitter, Paypal, Salesforce, Genentech, Apple, Dell, etc).

ly are we so happy with how Kyle and Jaque worked with us to make our music vision come to life, from ceremony to dance party, but we have also received endless comments from our guests about how amazing the band was. This team of musicians is the real deal! When our wedding ended, it was like we'd just attended an unforgettable concert where all our favorite songs were played gorgeously with our closest friends and family dancing alongside us.

ompared to a DJ. When it came time to book for a wedding band for ours, there was no other choice! Mercy & the Heartbeats took one look at the crowd and read our minds. The end of the night was a millennial’s dream filled with banger after banger! Blink 182, Backstreet Boys, Rihanna, Sum 41, Britney Spears, The Killers….No one could sit down since each song was better than the last. Everyone had borderline lost their voice by the end of the night we were singing along so hard. Oh and by the way, they handled all the sound for the ceremony, first dances, speeches, and had awesome stage lighting. For the ceremony, they provided discreet microphones for the groom and officiant’s lapels, and everyone could hear us perfectly. These guys are pros in every way. THANK YOU MERCY & THE HEARTBEATS for turning our wedding night into our favorite concert of all time too 😊

Mercy and the Heartbeats performed at our wedding last month and they were amazing. We saw them live at a street fair in Burligame, CA, and fell it love with them so we decided to ...

have them at our wedding. Every one of our guests had a blast! They have a wide variety of song list to choose from - from country rock songs to Big Wild. We loved the live performance for our first dance. They did the duet of "Can't help falling in love with you" for our first dance and it was so romantic to dance to. Jaque Lynn and Kyle were great. They also helped with ceremony and reception background music. Our wedding was at a winery with a stage and a nice space for dance floor and their audio quality was great. Your band made our dream to have a live band at our wedding came true! Great voice and great performance. Thank you Mercy and The Heartbeats!!!!!

Mercy & The Heartbeats are an amazing (wedding) band! Having a live band was a top priority for our wedding--We were looking for a high energy, high quality, and downright fun ba...

nd, so that there would be no lulls on the dance floor. We watched Mercy's 2021 promo video and were convinced that they could meet the bill: https://youtu.be/fGBzoCWND2c?si=Nk-MH91dfSpuQVUp . Boy, did they deliver! The band was top-notch and Jaque and Kyle's singing/performances/MCing were phenomenal! For the entirety of their set, the band had EVERYONE -- ages 4 through 80--dancing non-stop and having a great time. The setlist was also impeccable! We had requested some "MUST-PLAY" songs along with about 40 other songs of interests (read: way too many songs for a band to play in 3 hours). Mercy & the Heartbeats took that information, made some fantastic judgment calls, and made it into the best setlist I've ever experienced at a wedding. They smoothly transitioned across different genres (classic rock, 70s funk, 80s electro, punk, pop) and decades (60s, 70s, 80s, 90s, 00s, 10s, 20s), adding fun commentary and engaging with our guests. We are still getting great compliments on the band. They can really do anything! From start to finish, it was such a great experience communicating with Jaque and Kyle--from discussing our musical interests, talking about the space and expectations, and then closing out our wedding night! We had our reception at a Chinese banquet hall, with limited room. They kept in constant communication with us, our wedding planner and our venue to make sure they had enough space for their sound system, enough amperage and enough time to set up! I only wish I had another event coming up to book them and hear the rest of their repertoire!

We were beyond pleased with our amazing experience with Mercy & The Heartbeats. Whenever we have conversations about our wedding with friends and family everyone always says, "......

And the BAND! Can we just talk about how amazing the band was?" Mercy & The Heartbeats are so musically gifted and have the best energy about them to bring out the best possible vibes for your wedding or any event. They had everyone dancing and having the best time. They are also extremely professional, reliable, and quick to respond to communication. We were impressed with everything on the business side of things! We also really appreciated the additional add-ons they offered like musicians during cocktail hour and mic/AV set ups for the ceremony. We would highly recommend Mercy & The Heartbeats and are planning to go to one of their other shows soon!

Can’t say enough good things. Basically, HIRE THEM.

ey are INCREDIBLE performers and musicians. Seeing live music is a big part of our relationship, so the band was a big wedding priority for us and our standards are relatively high. I had watched many videos of Mercy & the Heartbeats, so my expectations were high, and they still exceeded them! I really don’t think you can find a better vocalist than Jaque- she really nails every note of every song. Our venue (the Cal Academy of Sciences) had more restrictions than the average venue, and they rolled with everything without issue. Their song catalogue is fun and very tasteful, and they did excellent covers of our first dances and the songs we picked for the ceremony. They are true professionals- communicative, friendly, and pricing was straightforward. The cherry on top for me is that they are a female-fronted and multiracial band. I can’t recommend Mercy & the Heartbeats enough! Thank y’all for making our wedding so much fun!!

ave been luckier. They were incredibly supportive through all phases of our wedding planning and execution. We didn't use a wedding planner, so sorting out all the details of the day fell to us. Fortunately, Kyle and Jacque are consummate professionals that communicated quickly, clearly, thoroughly, and kindly We changed our date three times and they were incredibly accommodating and patient with us each time. We also had a few special requests (MCing, special dances, adding a certain instrument, etc.) and they accommodated everything without hesitation. But most importantly, they absolutely brought it the night of our wedding. From the seamless MC experience during the ceremony to the unbelievably good live show, they rocked our wedding from start to finish. The sound quality was incredibly good, even in the middle of a forest, and they are genuinely gifted musicians with a passion for entertaining. We've had multiple guests ask us to put them in touch with the band to see if they're free for upcoming wedding dates. Truly truly, they were exceptional and could not have done a better job at our wedding. People danced all night and had the best time. We feel so lucky to have found Kyle, Jacque, and the rest of the team. If you're planning a wedding and are able to get Mercy & The Heartbeats to come play for you, do it. You will not regret your choice.

ng celebration... We wanted a formal wedding that didn't at all feel stuffy, a fancy party that was more than anything FUN. Boy, did they deliver!!! From asking us to choose from their impressive closet of performance costumes to match the vibe of our party, to beautifully learning new songs for our wedding processional (which made the ceremony SO special and personal), to delivering the best dance party our friends and family had ever seen... they were such a joy to work with. I cannot count how many people (close friends, distant relatives, elderly grandparents hard of hearing..) have called us after the event to rave about how incredible our band was, the best they've ever seen. We have 3 guests who have already inquired and booked Mercy & The Heartbeats for their future families weddings... they were that good! They kept the party going all night long, and although we would like to pride ourselves on having a fantastic, high energy group of people in attendance, Mercy and Heartbeats gave the party something so special that can only be described as EPIC. The dance floor was packed the entire night and they happily delivered TWO encores when party went wild after their first one. If you are hesitating on band vs dj, or on choosing a band in general... RUN don't walk to Mercy & the Heartbeats!

You have to book this band. From the very start, Mercy & the Heartbeats were incredibly accommodating and celebrated that our wedding day was about us. They helped us find other ...

resources, provided us with sound for our ceremony and reception, and of course- they got everyone to dance! They cleared up a lot of logistical sound headaches for us, helped us find our wedding coordinator, and made the night magical for us. From 6 year olds to 80 year olds, everyone was on the dance floor and they made the party last! I can't fully describe the joy this band brought to our lives and our loved ones'- but just imagine everyone you love, dancing together. That's what Mercy & the Hearbeats created for us. While we didn't think our families would enjoy live music as much as us, the common response was that Mercy and the Heartbeats were the best band they've seen in a long time.

Book them now. You won't regret it. From initial calls, to planning, and the wedding itself, Mercy & The Heartbeats was a dream to work with and NAILED IT. I found them based on ...

an incredible recommendation from a friend and they absolutely lived up to their reputation. I have never been to another wedding where the dance floor was FULL for hours on-end, but I am sure glad it was mine. They could read the room, keep the energy moving, seamlessly integrate breaks and other wedding 'moments', they play a variety for all age groups and kindly accommodated our specific song requests. Moreover, they are all talented beyond belief. We were all blown away by the breadth of music played that sounded better than the albums. I am a type-A personality and was very involved in the planning of our wedding, and the band was one of the best vendors we booked. I didn't have to give it a second thought day-of as Kyle was so insightful, responsive and professional in creating a plan prior-to. Mercy & The Heartbeats is still the talk of our guests as being the best wedding band they've ever seen. All of my mother-in-law's friends are legitimately trying to come up with party ideas to have them back. Anyway-- thank you to the whole band for quite literally making our wedding as magical as it was. You set the tone for the evening and man, you delivered beyond my wildest expectations and for that I will forever be grateful!!

If I could give 10 stars I absolutely would, could not have been more thrilled with Mercy & The Heartbeats. Most important thing a wedding band can do is play great live music, and...

the music was BAR NONE - all age groups were on the dance floor for the entirety of their 2+ hour set, spanning pop and dance music across generations from Fleetwood Mac to Bruno Mars. Our guests raved after that they "felt like they were at a concert", and that they delivered the "best dance party, wedding or not". The band did a fabulous job playing the dance party (and coordinating A/V for our ceremony / emceeing our reception), but they were just as flawless in all the leadup to our weekend. Through booking the band, finalizing the set list and coordinating with the venue, they were consummate professionals who answered every question we had and took care of all the small details so we could truly enjoy their performance as guests at our own wedding. Planning a wedding is hard, but signing Mercy & The Heartbeats is literally the easiest (and most fun) decision you will make. Thanks Jaque, Kyle and the whole band for making our wedding so special.

nd we had a blast! We knew that night that they had to play at our wedding. They were great about our song preferences (which we wanted mostly country) and created a fantastic playlist. Not only did they learn new songs for our special dances, but they even played our ceremony music which was so special and intimate! Hands down the best performers and definitely a highlight at our wedding! I am always looking for the next outdoor event they play so we can see them perform again!

Jackie and Kyle and the rest of the band were absolutely wonderful, from start to finish. In the early planning stages, they were communicative and personable. During the week-of, ...

we realized we wanted to mic up the reception and provide more speakers which they were more than happy to do. On the wedding day, they played our requested songs (but played seems like an understatement...they crushed them!), they danced, and they sung the roof off the place. Kyle even stayed around to DJ for a bit after the setlist ended. We can't thank nor recommend them enough . All of our friends and family are still talking about how much fun the band was. Do yourself a favor and hire Mercy and the Heartbeats now!

WOW! Hiring Mercy and The Heartbeats was seriously the BEST decision we made for our wedding. Everyone, and I seriously mean everyone, at our wedding came up to us and were raving ...

about this band, the dance floor wasn’t empty for even a second. We had Mercy and The Heartbeats perform our first dance song (Simply The Best), and asked them to make a special version that was more slowed down than the original song. They sent us a clip of their version beforehand to make sure we liked how they adjusted the tempo, which we so appreciated! The whole band was so talented. An extra special shout out to Kyle who was also an incredible MC. Kyle read the personalized reception intros for our wedding party, which he executed perfectly. He also ran “The Shoe Game” at our reception with such charisma and had the whole crowd, including us, laughing. We will forever remember them as one of the best parts of our wedding day.

es to punk rock. They brought the fun, energy, and great vibes and were able to feel out the room and tailor the set to match the flow of the evening. Several of our guests play instruments and have a deep appreciation for live music. They could not stop raving about Mercy all night and all the next day, particularly the quality of sound and musicianship in their crystal clear performance. Every single musician was absolutely 100 - the vocals were strong and clear, the bass slapped, the keys were perfect, and drums and guitar were so on point. I cannot emphasize enough how great they were. Do not hesitate to book them for your event!!

This is the band you want for your wedding. First thing’s first: they sound amazing. And we don’t say that lightly. We don’t mean “amazing” like “oh that was a fun Saturday nig...

ht.” We mean so many guests were bombarding us at and after the reception swearing that it’s the best band at any wedding they’ve ever attended. We mean people who we never thought would be on a dance floor were out there having a blast. Perhaps just as important: they’re super easy to work with. They were, without a doubt, the easiest part of planning our wedding. They’re professionals. They know exactly what to do and how to make it happen. They respond to emails. They show up on time. They’re gracious, warm, and flexible. When you hire them to play your wedding, please invite us. It's bound to be a good night.

tic, technically skilled, versatile in tone and genre, and charismatic like no other. Mercy and The Heartbeats learned a song that we requested for our first dance and NAILED it. Immediately after that song, they got the entire wedding out on the concert dance floor. So much fun. Final note: Kyle also MCed our speeches and did a fantastic job -- charming and punctual. Couldn't recommend them more strongly.

ring the processional to their incredible cover of our first dance song (Hard to Concentrate) to the most high-energy '80s and '90s hits that drew everyone to the dance floor and had everyone screaming along - they were not only excellent at what they do, but brought such a great vibe and positive energy! Multiple friends and family members said that the last 3 hours of our wedding felt more like a concert in the best way possible. We are eagerly keeping an eye on outdoor events they're playing and will drive for hours to see them again! Echoing the words of another reviewer, cut what you have to cut to work with them - even people who "don't dance" will get out there for this band.

In terms of the performance itself, they ROCKED! The band was on time and super professional during setup/soundcheck (our planner and her staff loved them), brought a top quality sound system, and every member played lights out. They hit all of our favorite songs, got everyone on the dance floor, AND THEY KEPT THEM THERE until our scheduled end time! They made our event incredibly special and we have recommended them to all of our Bay Area friends.

Mercy and the heartbeats were the BEST part of our wedding! My now wife and I found them in 2019 when we were planning for our 2020 wedding. They had a show in Pacifica and put us ...

on the guest list since they knew we were looking for wedding bands. Their show ended up being canceled due to rolling blackouts. Instead, they booked studio time that same night in Oakland and told us to meet them there and they would have beer and champagne for us. Without exaggerating, we saw the first 8 seconds of their first song and both looked at each other knowing it had to be this band and it was the best decision we made about our wedding. We had to push our date until 2021 and Mercy and the heartbeats stayed with us the whole way. They honored their original price and would check in with us periodically just to see how we were doing. Once the big day got closer, we had zoom calls with the band to discuss playlists etc. This band was so incredibly polite, professional, punctual and accommodating. Nicest band ever! They took all of our requests and threw out all songs we didn’t want to hear. They made everything SO EASY. It’s been a little over a week and I’m still getting texts and emails about how good the band was at the wedding. Bottoms line, if you’re having a wedding and need a band, you must hire this band if you want your guests to have a good time. If you need to not have a photo booth to afford this band. Do it. Trust me. I am an extremely satisfied customer! -Nick Piper
