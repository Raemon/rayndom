In the age of technology, there are so many [wedding tech trends](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-technology-trends) that it can be hard to keep up. However, using tech to your advantage can create an unforgettable event, like a silent disco wedding. Planning the right [activities for your wedding reception](https://www.theknot.com/content/secrets-to-a-fun-wedding-reception) is all about what kind of vibe you want to bring. Is it more personalized? More creative? How about more fun? A silent disco at a wedding is all of these things and more, with a chance to create the perfect dance floor experience for you and your guests.

We spoke with wedding expert Russ Powell of [Powell Weddings and Events](https://www.powellwe.com/), a photographer, DJ and entertainment vendor based in Salt Lake City, Utah, with experience in silent discos to help you get started on planning your own. So, let's look at everything you need to know about a wedding silent disco so you and your loved ones can get down and boogie.

**What to Know About Ha****ving a Silent Disco:** What Is It? | How Do They Work? | Cost | Pros | Cons | How to Hire

## What Is a Silent Disco? 

Though you may have heard of it, what is the point of a silent disco exactly? Unlike regular discos or raves, a silent one is where everyone is connected to wireless headphones, dancing to the same music via DJ or their own playlist. It's a great alternative to a classic wedding reception, especially if your guests have varied music tastes or your venue requires loud music to be shut off at a certain hour.

According to Powell, they originated in England, where dances are called "discos," so you aren't strictly limited to ['70s wedding songs](https://www.theknot.com/content/70s-wedding-songs) (though you can't go wrong with classic disco music). They're a unique spin on a classic reception that caters to everyone of all ages, making it a fun choice for any wedding day.

## How Does a Silent Disco Work? 

Silent discos work by creating a tailored experience for each guest, with their own set of headphones and a playlist either provided by the DJ, a recommended one from the couple or the guest's own dance playlist. Some vendors may have expertise in silent discos and rent equipment, which is especially helpful if you have a battle of the DJs where guests can listen to either during the party. You can suggest tons of styles to your DJ for the [after-party songs](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-after-party-songs)—from dance music to keep the energy up to more specific songs, like favorites from your relationship or meaningful songs for your loved ones.

### Get your party started

Find every kind of expert from DJs to musicians and more

Powell says, "Silent disco headsets allow guests to switch between multiple music channels. This is perfect for weddings where guests have varied musical preferences… Many silent disco headsets light up in different colors depending on the channel being listened to. Guests can instantly see who's vibing to the same music, [and] it also adds a cool visual effect to the dance floor as you watch the sea of headsets change color when a popular song comes on."

## Silent Disco Wedding Cost

According to Powell, "The average silent disco rental costs $6 to $7 a headset and $75 to $100 per transmitter. Then, there is the performer fee, which varies." Plus, the average [wedding DJ cost](https://www.theknot.com/content/average-cost-wedding-band-dj) can be anywhere from $1,000 to $2,000 for the night, with additional DJs costing an estimated $500 to $1,500. 

Overall, a silent disco, in addition to hiring a DJ, would cost more than hiring just the DJ, but there are services for renting headphones and equipment that could help cut costs. You can also use [The Knot Budget Advisor](https://www.theknot.com/wedding-budget) to calculate the price of local vendors and see how that factors into your wedding budget.

## Pros of Having a Silent Disco at Your Wedding

Some pros of having a silent disco include guests being able to control the volume of their music (which is especially helpful for any disabled or neurodivergent loved ones), guests getting to pick their own music and how handy it is for venues with noise ordinances. Plus, a silent disco is great if you're planning other nontraditional activities or want to incorporate exciting lighting displays (like these [disco ball wedding ideas](https://www.theknot.com/content/disco-ball-wedding)).

Powell says, "[Silent discos] don't take up as much space in the room as multiple large speakers. They are a different type of entertainment which is more interactive, [and] they are easy to set up and take down… They can be run by DJs or rented and used with a set playlist." 

He also adds a creative way couples have used silent disco equipment: "One of my favorite uses was for a wedding where they had family flying in from Turkey and wanted the groom's mom to be a part of the ceremony and hear in real-time without having to go back and forth on the microphone and translate, nor having someone whispering in her ear, disrupting other guests. We invited the translator to sit a little ways off from the ceremony next to the audio engineer with a microphone that fed directly into [her] headset."

## Cons of Having a Silent Disco at Your Wedding

One con of a silent disco at your wedding is that communicating with guests may be a bit tricky. Make sure the silent disco won't interfere with any special announcements, speeches or even the general socializing at your wedding. 

There are also some hidden costs and tasks associated with them that need to be considered. Powell says, "[Wedding silent discos] cost per headphone and each DJ is an extra cost, [and] they require a table and attendant to check headphones in and out. They require an attendant to clean after use [and] an attendant to watch the egress to make sure they don't get taken to the bathroom or walk out the door of the venue. [Silent discos also] require counting and packing at the end of the night."

While there are ways this can be a more low-key reception option, it does require planning ahead of time and coordinating with your DJ, so just be sure to factor that into your wedding.

## How to Hire a DJ for a Silent Disco at Your Wedding 

Hiring a DJ for your silent disco wedding reception means making sure they have the experience or familiarity with one. You may have to inquire with another vendor about renting headphones, lighting and other silent disco must-haves, but you may just find the perfect local DJ for this reception alternative. [The Knot Vendor Marketplace](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/wedding-djs) is the perfect resource when searching and contacting potential vendors. Add your silent disco needs to your list of [potential DJ questions](https://www.theknot.com/content/questions-to-ask-dj).

Now, do you need a DJ for a silent disco? Not necessarily, but they're extremely helpful in keeping the energy up, managing the silent disco and making things flow more smoothly. Powell says, "Not everyone is familiar with silent discos, so kick off the evening with a fun and engaging explanation. Have the DJ or emcee demonstrate how to switch channels and adjust the volume."
