About this vendor

Dare and Dazzle, Inc. is a wedding dress boutique based in Sonoma, CA that offers eco-friendly attire and accessories for contemporary couples. The shop designs and crafts gowns and other ensembles that are affordable and can be rented as well as purchased. From intimate elopements to grand affairs, the team will pamper you and your wedding party while pioneering a sustainable business model. Co-founders Hien Le and Mandy Tachiki are passionate about helping soon-to-be-newlyweds find wedding dresses that won’t compromise their values. After their own nuptials, when they couldn’t find gowns to rent, this duo decided to start their own business. They were inspired by the fact that every year the fashion industry is responsible for up to 92 million tons of waste. These entrepreneurs wanted to provide an alternative experience that would make room in the closet, the wallet, and the earth. Each of the dresses at Dare and Dazzle, Inc. is named for a strong and independent woman. The founders hope that when you try on these gowns, you will also feel empowered and beautiful. The salon hosts an extensive collection, from A-line frocks to asymmetrical white suits. Rented outfits are fully tailored to suit your body and are thoroughly cleaned to feel as good as new. The variety of styles and sizes will appeal to the modern affianced who wants a stunning and unique look on the aisle.

I loved that I could wear a high quality dress for a fraction of the price that I didn't have to worry about selling, storing, or cleaning after the fact! I also loved that I coul...

This place is AMAZING and should be the future of the wedding industry! Great communication and super accommodating. Getting a beautiful, high-quality wedding dress at an affordabl...

e price that you don't have to worry about altering, cleaning, or storing takes so much stress and pressure off as a bride, and knowing that you're choosing the eco-friendly option is the cherry on top. I would rent from them again in a heartbeat and will recommend them to anyone looking for a low-stress wedding dress experience.

The dress was beautiful! My low rating is because my dress arrived after my ceremony day! I purchased my dress a year in advance and since this was a destination ceremony Dare and ...

Dazzle took charge of shipping my dress. I though shipping USPS was concerning considering they don't deliver on Sunday. We arrive on Friday and my ceremony was Tuesday. My dress was delivered on Wednesday by Feb Ex and I wonder why it wasn't sent that way the first time? I Also could have had my ceremony on Wed instead of Tuesday if that led to a longer window for USPS delivery. The date was very flexible. Hindsight is 20/20 and I really trusted Dare and Dazzle since they do this for a living --but now I wish I had. It was very stressful not to have a dress on my wedding day! The venue was helpful and the photographer and the officiant of the wedding changed everything for me! Dare and Dazzle never apologized for the last dress, argued with me and never even followed up with me afterward. It was a beautiful dress but sad experience

Dare and Dazzle exceeded all my expectations! My dress was beautiful, affordable, and the shop was so friendly and accommodating. Our wedding was held in Novmeber 2022 in Napa and...

it was so nice to pick up my rented wedding dress on the way to the venue. It saved so much money and I love seeing my dress rented out to other brides. Highly recommend using Dare and Dazzle for your wedding accessories and/or dress. You have the option to buy or rent from this shop and whatever method you choose, You won't regret it!

So amazing. Hien helped me find the perfect dress and made me feel so comfortable. She was very attentive and had a lot of good advice. This was the first and last shop I went to f...

or my dress and I couldn’t be happier with what I got. The shop is so cute and has great lighting and stages to take pictures and get a feel for your dress. I can’t say enough, I loved everything about it and the ladies I brought with me loved it too. Love that there’s rental and buy options (I ended up buying mine) and very affordable compared to the dresses I was looking at online. As someone considered plus size I was nervous even going into any shop to try dresses but my mom convinced me and I am so happy she did!

I have had my eyes on this shop for a while now, and it exceeded my expectations far more than I could have ever imagined! The shop is beautiful and perfectly sized for a private b...

ridal party. I was in awe as soon as I walked in. Its design is well thought out and thoughtfully put together. The ceiling is high, and it feels magical to walk into. Hien is amazing to work with. I felt beautiful in all of her amazing gowns. She listened to what I wanted and was able to pull the dress that ended up being my Yes to the dress! The gowns are made to be rented and have built in bras and corsets that allow the perfect fit for people of all sizes. It was nice to be able to find my dress and know how I would look and feel in it without having to think of alterations. I was able to have a private appointment with 7 of my bridesmaids/family. We brought our own champagne and spent a little over two hours trying on dresses. It was a really fun experience for everyone. A few of my bridesmaids were able to try on some bridesmaids dresses as well. Dare and Dazzle offers a sustainable and affordable wedding gown option. They are a small Asian owned business with a lot to offer to the wedding industry. The gowns are incredibly well made. They are the quality of a $2k+ gown at a fraction of the cost. I can't rave about them enough and I hope more brides can find this shop to rent (or buy) the dress of their dreams!
