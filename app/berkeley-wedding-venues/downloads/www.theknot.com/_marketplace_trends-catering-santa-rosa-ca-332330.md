We really enjoyed working with Susan and her team at Trends Catering. They did a great job at our wedding at Vine Hill House in August 2024, and several guests commented to us how ...

much they loved the food. Our favorites were the salmon with sriracha aioli, the Vine Hill salad, and the appetizers: Thai quesadillas, smoked salmon and salsa on corn cakes, grilled Thai prawns, and the cheese table. We also really enjoyed the family style serving at dinner. Susan is fun to work with and collaborates very smoothly with the Vine Hill House team. It is clear that she wants you to love the food at your wedding, and is flexible to what you want. The catering staff and bartenders were great. We would highly recommend Trends!

ir staff were attentive, professional, and fun. High quality, fresh, and delicious food was a major goal for our wedding since we've been to many weddings with sub-par food. Trends exceeded all of our expectations and working with Susan made the whole process seamless, stress-free, fun and enjoyable. You cannot go wrong with Trends.

rom our first tasting with Susan I knew we had made probably the best decision of our wedding in hiring her. She is so fun, funny, joy filled, understanding, helpful and SHE KNOWS FOOD! Our food wasn't just great wedding food, it was great food PERIOD. We are still getting compliments about how delicious everything was! Some of my favorites of hers are the Thai quesadillas, the California caesar, the ravioli with pesto, the lemon salmon, and the mashed potatoes, and the green beans with mint, but truly you can't go wrong. When I had some last minute changes to our rentals a couple weeks before the wedding, Susan handled it with ease and reassurance. My husband and I can't possibly recommend this team more!!

he food was absolutely top-notch. The Thai quesadilla starters were a hit, and the chicken skewers were juicy and full of taste. The main dishes, like the salads, filet mignon, and salmon, were loved by everyone. And the crowd-pleasers like smash mashed potatoes and baked ziti were just delicious. Trends suggested we serve the meals in a family-style, and it was a great idea. It let our guests dig in, chat, and enjoy our celebration while eating some amazing food. This style brought everyone together and let them try a bunch of different tasty dishes. The team at Trends was really good with our guests. They took care of every detail perfectly, showing that they're really professional and pay attention to everything. The bars, including a cool cigar station, a tequila tasting, and a full bar, were well-run and made sure all our guests were happy and impressed. The quality of the food was matched by the great presentation of the food and bars. Trends Catering turned our venue into a food lover's dream, showing how creative and dedicated they are. We really recommend Trends Catering. Susan, Chef Carlos, and their team went over and above to make sure our wedding was a hit. They were professional, great at cooking, and handled a big event like ours effortlessly. If you're looking for a catering company that will wow your guests with yummy food, great service, and neat presentation, you should definitely pick Trends Catering.

Susan and her team were amazing! She was such a pleasure to work with and we really enjoyed her sense of humor. She made the catering experience more fun from beginning to end. We ...

really felt she went above and beyond to make sure we got everything we wanted and she delivered the best experience. She listened to our specific needs which included people who were vegetarian and vegan and worked with all our dietary and allergy needs and delivered amazing food. The ethnic foods were very authentic and delicious. All the food was a big hit and the bartenders delivered strong and delicious mixed drinks. The presentation was beautiful, really an artwork. Service was exceptional and everyone left very stuffed and satisfied. We are still hearing rave reviews from our guests about the food. Susan even sent us home that night with samplings of all the food to enjoy later which was very appreciated. We could not thank her enough for all she did t elevate our wedding day!

Susan and her team were fantastic. From the first phone call I knew Susan would deliver- she really cares about you and your wedding and will work to make it perfect. The food was ...

delicious and reasonably priced. The bartenders were great and did a wonderful job on our signature drinks; they even made espresso martinis to pass around at the end of the night. As my husband is British, Susan wanted to make us a U.K. related midnight snack- they came up with tasty curry fries with mango dipping sauce. If you are looking for a company that really cares and will take care of you , look no further. Thank you Susan and team, we loved you!

We tried several caterers and both sets of parents and we all unanimously picked Trends. The food tastes like it's cooked from the heart and it is. Susan is deeply involved in her ...

business and it's very obvious how much she cares about what she's doing. Susan was fabulous to work with and very responsive. The food itself is incredible. I'm still dreaming about the Thai chili quesadilla appetizers we had passed around. The family-style service was also a big hit for everyone! Susan's staff were really on top of it - we never saw a line at the bar and the servers were thorough, efficient, and friendly. They also did a great job of checking in with me and making sure I was eating and had what I needed! At the end of the night, Susan sent us home with a little care package of leftover food, which was so thoughtful. It's that level of care and extra effort that really sold us on Trends to begin with. We all loved it so much, our family decided to use Trends to cater the rehearsal dinner as well! We would highly recommend working with Susan and her team. We're so glad that we did!

ends catered our wedding at Vine Hill House. From my first contact with Trends to the tasting to selecting our menu and table settings, etc. to the big day, Susan and her staff were committed to flawless execution. Trends food is delicious (our guests raved about the fresh, seasonal flavors and beautiful presentation - family style was perfect!) and Susan and her staff were so professional and hard-working throughout the evening. I can’t say enough good things about the Trends food and vendor experience - you will be glad, again and again, that Susan and her staff are an integral part of your wedding team.

I wouldn't recommend any other company if you really want the best experience, work withTrends!

Trends Catering was one of two caterers our venue allowed us to select from. We first met with Susan at our tasting and were so impressed by her and the food that we did not end up...

meeting with the other caterer. Susan was very helpful every step of the way in the planning process. We had a meeting with Susan at Encore Event Rentals where we laid out the linens, flatware, and glassware together as these items are included in the price with Trends. Susan advised on how much liquor/ingredients we needed for our signature cocktails and with planning our dessert menu. Trends was able to cook the food on site at our venue so everything was served warm, with fresh, local ingredients. We choose family style which was a big hit! Everyone could try each of the options and didn't have to stand in line at a buffet. We chose the tri tip in a pinot reduction and the salmon with avocado salsa as entrees and both were delicious. Everyone commented on how good the food was and the overall service throughout the night. Susan caters 3-4 weddings a week and still had time to answer all of my emails. In the end, Susan and team nailed it!

All the food transitions were seamless and the flow of service was absolutely perfect. The food was amazing and I had so many guests complimenting on how good everything tasted. We served everything family style and portions were super generous. I can't recommend Trends enough! Thank you Susan and team so much for everything! We are so, so pleased! -Mike&Vanessa

Delicious food and amazing service!!! We used Trends Catering for our wedding on 4/30 and the food is amazing and people from the wedding are still telling us how delicious it was!...

It is SO satisfying to hear your guests had fun, but also loved the food. This will happen for you too if you choose Trends :) All the food was cooked on site at the venue and came out fresh and hot. We did family style and I can't tell you how many people told me they loved not having to choose between the amazing tri tip in a pinot noir reduction or my personal favorite, chicken breast grilled with pancetta and fig. There are too many amazing sides to choose from, but another personal favorite was the pesto pasta. This was a hit with EVERYONE! Vegetarians included :). Trends is a green caterer, with all the food being local coming from a 100 mile radius and everything is seasonal! This makes a huge difference in the taste of your food and something that is so important when choosing a caterer. You also got to chose all your linens for the tables, bar, glasses and flatware with Trends, making the process so simple for you and efficient with it all coming from one place. I chose some amazing rose gold flatware and it was included in the price! It looked phenomenal with my blush/peach linens. I have to specifically mention the staff too. All of the bartenders and servers were some of the nicest people I have ever met or worked with before. They were there to help in any situation, always attentive, and anticipated your needs. What a great group of people!! Have no hesitation in booking Trends, you will be so happy you did!

Almost everyone at my wedding was head over heels for the food. It was so incredibly delicious and the staff is great. My husband and I were reluctant to spend so much on food (it ...

is the biggest cost of any wedding!) because catering food is usually just mediocre. Sue's food is outstanding. We are giving four stars instead of five, because we thought the business side of the transaction could have gone a bit smoother. When we asked some in depth question about certain line items and how they were calculated, we got a bit of push back and frustration. Overall, the bit of headache we experienced was well worth it for the delicious food!!!

What can I say about Susan?! She's the best! After I had looked into a number of catering companies, my venue owner suggested I meet with Susan. "You two will really get alo...

ng," he said. Well, he wasn't kidding. Susan and I are both type A people. I was planning my entire wedding, and I wanted to play a big part in deciding how to make the food "us." Susan was one of my favorite parts of the planning process. She jumped at all my ideas, would add her two-cents, and from there we'd develop a plan. She's quick to respond to your emails, like, very quick! We found that bouncing ideas off each other was a lot of fun! She understood that I didn't want a cookie-cuter wedding, and she delivered! Her food was made AT the venue - not "seared" at the venue. Our guests RAVED about the food! This is hard to come by at a wedding. And because we were off taking pictures & talking with people, we didn't get much to eat - so she surprised us with a huge bag of food to take home at the end including 1 plate of each dish, not just each entree, but even the hor d'oeroves! She not only agreed to make enough cookies for a cookie bar (instead of a cake), but she used my mom's "famous" recipe! That really touched my heart. She met with me whenever I wanted, and let me tell you this wasn't because she wasn't busy. She was SWAMPED! She was constantly off running to another wedding, or meeting with a bride but she still was able to prioritize me & my wishes. This is what brides want, or at least me - a vendor who can be there when YOU'RE available vs the other way around! The only sad part is that my wedding is over. Susan & I have emailed a few times just because we miss each other. Kinda sad, but she's awesome. If you're into planning your wedding, I highly recommend Trends! If you want to make your wedding your own, talk to Trends! If you want to serve yummy food that's made at the venue, hire Trends! If you want to have a friend post-wedding, pick Trends! OH- and did i mention that she was the most affordable?! and I highly recommend serving it Family style! I couldn't say enough good things! :-)

We worked personally with the owner Susan and I must say she is fantastic!Susan is the most organized woman you can imagine! She gets to know you personally and creates outstanding...

dishes to match you and your guests. We have a very diverse family with many personal likes and dislikes and everyone from vegans in our family to country home cooking eating guest raved about her food and presentation at our wedding!Susan not only took care of our menu but also handled all the rental items from tables and chairs to fine linens and crystal-ware making it one less worry and stress on our planning (the 100+plus her head included the rentals). She also always has a back up plan with a back up plan for cliches that happen unexpectedly. I loved her for that! I highly recommend Trends catering :-)

I met so many caterers as I started my search, but I ultimately ended going with Trends Catering because of the quality of food and because Susan was so amazing. It was clear from...

the start that Susan puts her whole heart into catering and what results is beautifully decorated tables and delicious food. Susan had so many ideas (hay bale couches, s'more station!) and never shied away from sharing them, even if it meant extra work for her. During the week of the wedding, it looked like it would rain on the actual day, so Susan came up with several solutions in case it did. I never once stressed about anything because Susan had all of the details covered. All of the guests loved the food and raved about it afterward. Picking Trends Catering was one of the best decisions we made for our wedding and I 100% recommend them.

l make sure everything is taken care of. First, the food she prepared was absolutely outstanding with local and organic ingredients. People still rave about the lemonade, cucumber water and teas that greeted them, the gazpacho shooters, the local cheese display, the tequila lime prawns, etc. In addition, Susan's outstanding creativity showed. The tables were beautiful and consistent with the florist's creations. Susan handled all the rentals, did a smooth and un-intrusive set up and break down. Her staff couldn't have been nicer and her pricing was absolutely reasonable! I knew going into my wedding I had absolutely nothing to worry about with Susan looking after me and I was right!
