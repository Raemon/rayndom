Description

The sparkly mini wedding dress of your dreams has finally arrived, and she goes by the name of Berry. This exquisite short gown is adorned with intricate beaded lace that shimmers with every step you take. She features tank straps that beautifully balance her overall design, providing a pleasing symmetry to her square neckline and shoulder area. With her versatile sheath silhouette, Berry allows brides to have the option to accessorize with a pair of elegant gloves for a touch of vintage glamour or attach her detachable overskirt to add some drama for the walk down the aisle.
