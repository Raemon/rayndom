ith and made the difference for us when selecting a venue. Their kindness, flexibility, and willingness to go above and beyond allowed us to have the wedding we truly hoped for- down to every detail. Throughout the process we were able to work with Katrina and Liv to get opinions, plan the order of events, set up the wedding tasting, and answer any questions we had. On the day of the event, they set up everything exactly as we specified and added their artistic touches. We chose a buffet style dinner with halibut and short ribs, and the food in our opinion was absolutely delectable. They catered to our preferences and every thing turned out exactly as described. Our guests commented on how high energy and friendly the staff was during the dinner service. Our party had a tremendous time. We would highly recommend the Club Los Meganos to any couple in the bay area for their wedding! Thank you CLM team and staff!!

I have nothing but positive reviews and I highly recommend this place to anyone for any occasion. Club Los Meganos was our last stop in our search for a wedding venue, and althou...

gh we were already set on one venue we visited prior to this one, my husband and I decided to check the place out. And we were so glad we did! The grounds were absolutely stunning. It was spacious, modern and upscale...with a beautiful garden for people to socialize and take tons of photos. They also have a lovely vineyard where we took sunset pictures. They have lighted bocce courts and lawn games such as chess (great for kids to hang out). It really is a venue for any age to enjoy. We also have the flexibility of choosing our own vendors and not tied to a package as you would see with other venues that require you to use their preferred vendors. My husband and I immediately fell in love with the space, and agreed that Club Los Meganos was the ONE. So we said yes to the venue and booked it for our wedding on Oct 7, 2022. We worked closely with Monica and Lily, the event manager and coordinator at Club Los Meganos at the time. And they were awesome! They were prompt in answering our emails and super accommodating with our wishes. They were detail oriented and proactive, making sure we have the correct colored linens, our floor plan was up to date, our signature drinks were made to our liking, etc--and communicating with our own wedding coordinator to make sure the big day goes smoothly. One week prior to our wedding day, we had an entire family who unfortunately couldn't make it to the wedding, and at this point we have already provided the venue our total numbers. So instead of having their plates go to waste and money go to waste, we asked if the money could go towards the open bar instead, and they went above and beyond to do so for us. I don't think alot of venues would do that for their clients, so we were grateful they did. Our wedding day was amazing, and we couldn't be any happier with how it turned out. The one thing my husband and I wanted during the big day, was to be stress free, and have fun; to enjoy every moment. And thanks to our awesome vendors, they made sure we didn't have to worry about a thing. In the end, we received alot of compliments from our wedding guests, raving about the venue, the amazing open bar and food, and how organized the event was. We have our amazing vendors, including the Club Los Meganos team to thank for that.

good listener, gave great suggestions and detailed information. She seemed genuinely happy for us. My husband and I felt like we were in good hands. I must say our experience with CLM was stellar. Wedding planning can be extremely stressful however we felt that everything was under control and on point, we were able to focus on other aspects of the wedding planning because CLM was so organized. We highly recommend them to anyone!

garden area outside was a wonderful place for everyone to socialize, take pictures, and play games. Everyone had a great time during happy hour while the staff served delicious hors d'oeuvres and plenty of drinks! The dining area inside had ample seating and our guests really loved all of the food options at the buffet. We also really enjoyed the photobooth and the open dance floor that both became big hits all throughout the night. Last but not least, Lilian is a very friendly event manager who made sure that our dream wedding went by smoothly. She was super accommodating throughout the entire planning process and was readily available to help out and to answer all of our questions. Overall, we would highly recommend the venue and the staff for an amazing and fun time!

oordinators as I had 3 event coordinators within a years timeframe given turn over rate. That being said, my last venue organizer Monica, was AMAZING and helped to really organize everything with just 6 weeks until wedding day. The food was delicious, had many compliments from guests about the good tasting food and great service from staff members. Ensure to speak with bartenders during the event if you plan on having more of an open bar set up as I did experience twice when bartenders were charging guests for their drinks instead of asking me if I first wanted to increase my budget for beverages. I highly recommend doing a sparkler exit outside as the pictures were absolutely stunning. Ensure to let vendors know early on about this venues insurance requirements and obtain forms about this from venue early on to not be stressed about this as time nears the event day. I would book at Club Los Meganos again as it was the perfect venue for us!!

er at times. The other issue is the lack of communication, that the same staff no longer works at the venue and no one communicated that with us. The place is really beautiful but if I had known the Event Manager wouldn’t handle our wedding properly we may have turned down the place. We’re really glad everything worked out and once we had a new contact person (Jessica) and she was really nice and informative. We heard nothing but compliments of the place and the fire pit was used all night. It’s a very big venue and honestly for the amount of guest we had there were plenty of room. The staff were all very nice and all our guest were taken care of. The landscape was beautiful and so many different area to take pictures. Jessica was honestly the best and because of her, I would recommend this hidden gem.

TL;DR: Club Los Meganos was able to give us the most memorable and special ceremony and reception, despite quarantine in 2020. If you are looking for an amazing group of people who...

go above and beyond for you, this is where you need to get married. Shoutout to the following people: \- Our Wonder Woman event planner: Kristen McElley \- Our Hardworking wedding concierge: Jessie Rodriguez \- Our beautifully sweet event assistant: Lacey Lopez When my husband and I were looking for a venue that would accommodate the number of people for our wedding, we were met were overrated prices and crazy additional costs that weren't needed. I was becoming discouraged about finding the perfect venue for our reception until my husband found Club Los Meganos. We made our way to the venue and were immediately met with a welcoming crew. Kristen showed us the space and how pricing would go, and we were SHOCKED at how reasonable the price was for such a huge space! She made herself available at all times whenever we had questions, concerns, or changes, making our worries at ease. Even when changes were being made in the venue space, she made it her priority to always call us and let us know so that we can check any changes with our vendors. Then the worst news happened: Covid hit and stay at home orders were implemented. We kept in touch with Kristen over the next few months to make sure we were still able to have our wedding. With encouraging moments of being able to do a taste test with our parents and choosing our linens, we felt that everything was going to be okay. And once again our fears were met: Contra Costa was moving into a purple tier three weeks before the wedding. My husband and I kept in close contact with Kristen during the next week as she was figuring out if we were in the clear. And finally, we got the green light. On the day of the rehearsal, Kristen and her team were on top of everything and it went smoothly. Mid-rehearsal, all of us received was seemed like an amber alert on our phones. Looking we saw that the stay at home order was implemented again, but this time it was the day AFTER the wedding! We couldn't have been more thrilled! The day of the wedding came, and Kristen and the team were able to let us into our respective suites and bring us anything we needed to make sure we got ready on time. They made it so much easier for us to breathe and enjoy the moment. Our ceremony was the most beautiful moment in our lives, and no issues happened that day. They kept us on time even to do a vineyard shoot before our reception, and made sure we were the first people taken care of. I surprised my husband with a special number from Selena, which I had to change my outfit mid reception. They made sure to get me in and out of my outfit in time to perform, and that was the highlight of the day. Ending the night with some sparklers and a delicious fry bar, I knew nothing could compare to this day. I know this is super long, but you have to understand how much Kristen, Jessie, and Lacey did for us and our wedding. They went above and beyond what any normal event planners would do for their clients. In the end they weren't just someone we hired, they became our family. Thank you again Club Los Meganos for making our wedding day the most memorable and special day of our lives. We love you all so much. Love Always, Malcolm & Chelseah Henzaga

married her instead of my husband. My mom was a mother of the bridezilla, and Kristen was so kind and responsive to her. She was also really great about letting us come to the venue as much as we wanted to try out our decorations, etc. etc. We got married Nov. 2020, during the pandemic, and the venue made sure everything was in place to keep their staff and our guests safe. For months we weren’t even sure if we were going to be able to get married due to our county being closed, and Kristen was so supportive during that time.

Well where to begin, Cynthia & Kristen were our coordinators and day of coordinators. First I want to say that they are incredible at their job, emails were promptly responded to, ...

changes were made immediately, and their expert advice made our wedding go beyond expectations. I think most people would have a lot of anxiety during not only the wedding planning stages but also the day of but I can tell you that with these guys and their team, we had zero stress, zero anxiety and of course ZERO problems. They planned everything down to the minute, and even though we were the reasons that things didn't go on time, they were excellent at handling any last minute changes. When we were behind, they never pushed us to get back to our original routine, but rather asked us what we wanted and how we wanted it. Best yet, most of this was done behind the scenes, they allowed us to have all the fun we wanted while maintaining the structure that all weddings have. If I had the chance to redo it all over again, we would book the same venue and hire the same coordinators. I can't thank them enough for making sure that our special day was the most special day we've ever had! And they achieved it, beyond our wildest dreams. Now a bit about the venue, it is freaking GORGEOUS. The ceremonial lawn was huge and scenic. The minimalist lawn area added a degree of elegance that we hadn't expected. The actual hall was gorgeous, and HUGE we had about 120 people and we easily could have had double that. The entire grounds were amazing, so much room for everyone to roam around in. I didn't even get a chance to explore the entire place as it was way too big for how fast everything went. If you guys want a place that's already beautiful and requires very little decorations, this is it. Some uplights and flowers are all you need (maybe not even flowers?). The staff is incredibly polite, professional and extremely well trained. Everyone at our wedding loved the venue, and they loved how kind each and every member of the staff was. I honestly cannot recommend this place enough, I can't recommend our coordinators enough. I would say, take your chances with them (but honestly you're not gambling at all, these guys are the real deal!). Do yourselves a favor, book Club Los Meganos and don't look back. Your day will be beyond expectation. Love, Navi & Vinh 2019

Kristen, Cynthia, and Jennifer are communicative, detail-oriented, and completely dedicated to ensuring that every detail of your day is perfect. The Club itself is gorgeous, and has both beautiful outdoor spaces which feature stunning views of Mount Diablo and the surrounding vineyards, as well as a spacious indoor area which is full of natural light, and can easily be transformed to suit any style of decor.

I received so many compliments from family and friends about this venue. The food was very delicious and there’s many options to chose from. Basically anything you chose to have they will make it happen! I wish I could relive our special day again! I am beyond thankful with Kristen for helping us, and being so understanding with all of the requests and details my husband and I had. It was truly magical and perfect in every way! Kristen is such a valuable asset to Club Los Meganos. She was available at all times. Her response to emails and phone calls was top notch. She is very detail oriented and everything is clear from the beginning, from pricing to the smallest detail she will make sure it’s on paper. The venue also provided us with a “Bridal Concierge” her name was Jessica, she was phenomenal!!! She was by my side literally the entire day. She made sure our entire bridal party was comfortable. She really got things going that day. Honestly I think that’s why I was so calm the entire morning before the wedding started. She brought all of our food and drinks to our room and was just so sweet and understanding. She’s a very young lady with so much potential and I’m extremely happy she was there to help at every moment. I can go on with so many more compliments! My husband and I are just so thankful with the entire staff. There was 3 weddings that weekend between Fri-Sun, but the staff was still so hard working and always happy to help out at any moment. ♥️♥️

For us, selecting the venue for our wedding was the absolute starting point, the Square One that would inform every other aspect of the wedding planning. We scouted out a variety o...

f locations and services, and ultimately chose Club Los Meganos. Now that we’re married, we can safely say that CLM was an excellent choice. From start to finish, the people there were helpful, attentive, generous, and lots of fun. We worked with Jenna for the first half of the planning, and had Cynthia to see things through for the second half: both of them were a joy to be around and made the planning process way easier and manageable for us. Club Los Meganos provided their own catering (which was AWESOME), and worked easily with our outside vendors (cake, flowers, and so on). They explained all of the available services available, and helped to customize the package that we wanted and could afford. On the day of, Cynthia was there to make sure things ran smoothly, adapting to last-minute changes in our schedule and overseeing an awesome crew of workers when it was time to clean up at the end of the night. And you know the old stereotype of not eating at your own wedding? They TOTALLY made sure we got to eat the scrumptious dinner (that WE picked out) at our reception! The location has many charming features (a fountain, a fire pit, a chess lawn, etc.), but it was the people who made the experience as enchanting as it was. The rising cost of weddings today is no joke, so we recommend investing in the most important aspect: talented, flexible, delightful people, which is exactly what we found at Club Los Meganos.

ou guys truly made my husband and I feel like royalty. Like, what venue would serve the bride french fries during her first look? What venue had shots ready for the bridal party as soon as the ceremony was over? Who ensured that ceremony chairs were covered while the rain was pouring so I was able to have my perfect wedding? YOU GUYS. From the photos or even a visit to the site, you can already see how GORGEOUS this venue is. Our wedding was in November, so we knew we couldn't have it outdoors. But when we saw that the windows OPENED up to the fire pits/bocce ball courts- my mouth dropped. Our sweetheart table was right in the middle and it was such a gorgeous view for our guests to see. We chose the ceremony lawn and we didn't do much as far as decor, because the tree just added the right amount of romance and softness that I was looking for. The food was delicious (we chose the buffet) and french fry bar was a must for our drunk guests! Seriously though, the most outstanding part of having your wedding at Club Los Meganos is the team there (Cynthia, Jenna and Jennifer). They were such a joy to work with, super flexible and seriously was on top of everything! BOOK YOUR WEDDING HERE!

a, and Jennifer are the best in the game and know exactly what they are doing. They respond quickly to emails/calls, keep you on track with wedding planning, help with wedding timeline, execute a great rehearsal, and are there by your side on the day of the wedding. We received many compliments from our guests--some even told us this was the best wedding they have ever been too. For our wedding we chose a buffet and the food was delicious! I simply cannot say enough great things about this venue! Thank you again, Club Los Meganos. We will NEVER forget our special day and are forever grateful for the everlasting memories you helped create with all of our friends and family.

ecial day went off without a hitch. I cannot thank them enough for taking away any and all worries when it came to making sure things ran smoothly on our big day. I did not have a designated wedding planner, so we were extra careful to make sure we had designated family members/friends, etc. in the loop to keep things running on schedule, but everyone at Club Los Meganos had us covered from the morning-of getting ready, all the way until the end of the night when we were the only ones left. I cannot recommend this venue, and the staff highly enough! Also, the grounds are absolutely beautiful - and neutral so you can transform the space however you'd like depending on your theme, etc.

ped us throughout the whole thing. From the very beginning, the communication with the Club Los Meganos team was exquisite. From booking the venue about a year in advance, the team were always responsive when we had any questions or always willing to work with us to really make our wedding day the best day ever. The team was accommodating, and I liked that they were very organized. I especially loved that they walk through the day with you and gave us feedback on timeline and anything else that we needed help with. Then the day of couldn’t have went any smoother. I was very happy that everything went accordingly and I can’t thank the Club Los Meganos team enough. My husband and I chose Club Los Meganos for our wedding ceremony and reception because the venue is so BEAUTIFUL AND AMAZING and I loved the flow of all the spaces! When you walk in the venue you can just tell that the space will be just beautiful. This venue has a great foyer that has a display case in which you can display anything you want there, we displayed some of our engagement photos there. There’s also a bocce ball court that has patio lights above it and at night it looks great and definitely a fun activity for guests! There’s also a big chess board at the venue which I thought was super cute because guests can play and take pictures there. We also had a bridal rooms to get ready in. The reception area is pretty well sized in my opinion and my favorite part was the doors that opened up the reception area to outside space and it made everything more open. And since it was a September evening, it was perfect weather to have the doors open. Overall, I think this venue is the perfect venue! The team is the best team to work with and the venue space is so elegant and had everything that makes a memorable wedding for the bride and groom and their guests! Highly recommend Club Los Meganos!

d immediately fell in love with how beautiful the venue was from the rose garden, the ceremony lawn and the reception hall. We booked it right away! Throughout the year and a half of planning I worked with Jenna Choban who was our coordinator. She was the incredible coordinator anyone could ever have. I had so many questions and concerns about the weather, last minute changes, minor details, as I'm sure many brides do especially when they day gets closer but Jenna was always quick to respond to my emails with all of my questions and concerns answered, she really made my stress level so minimal because I trusted that she would make our wedding perfect and boy, did they!! The day of the wedding they had all of the set up done perfectly and we had someone consistently by our sides asking if we needed anything, water, food ect. It was so great! The team there is by far the best, always attentive and with smiling faces! All of our guest raved about how beautiful the venue was and how delicious the food was! Everyone enjoyed it so much. If you are looking to have a beautiful wedding and also want to convenience of having someone handle almost everything for you, then Club Los Meganos is the perfect place, we can't say enough good things about it. We love it so much that we are now hosting our corporate events there regularly! I highly recommend checking this place out, I am certain you'll love it as much as we do!

My husband and I had our wedding reception here on 11/18/17. We had booked 1 year in advance, and from the very beginning Club Los Meganos' communication was impeccable. Jenna Chob...

an and her team are absolutely amazing! She listened to all of our requests and did so much for us the day of the wedding and the coordination was just seamless! She kept everything moving and communicated with every vendor when we ended up running late from the bride & groom photos. She gave great feedback, and addressed all of our concerns. She was so prompt in responding to every email I sent (I sent a lot!) and had an answer and recommendation for everything. She made the process so easy for us, and we are ever so thankful. Club Los Meganos itself is a BEAUTIFUL event center! I fell in love with it the moment I stepped in. The entrance also offers a display case where you can present your engagement photos of you and your spouse to add a little personal touch to the space. Our guests loved this. There is a beautiful court outside that is lit up all night as well as a fire pit where guests can sit. It made for great pictures! The grounds are just so beautiful and well-kept, so perfect for pictures. There is so much space that you don't have to worry about doing without something because of size. I had a dessert table, cake table, photo booth, memorial table, 10 rounded tables, and a sweetheart table, and it felt so spacious and comfortable! There's nothing like going to a wedding and having to excuse yourself behind someone while you squeeze behind them as they are sitting at the table. This venue isn't one of them ;) The food was amazing and the Chef was so professional and knowledgeable. Set up and take down was wonderful, and that is a huge plus when planning a wedding. They also cut and served the cake, as well as served the champagne toast which is so wonderful! Club Los Meganos made our day so special, and took so much off of our hands, that we were able to enjoy the wedding ourselves. We are so lucky to have found this venue and team of coordinators. I would love to do my vow-renewal here and any other event! (I plan, too, lol) Extremely highly recommended.. The most beautiful and elegant venue in the East Bay!

Also a big shout out to Chef Frank who went out of his way to ensure every guest would be satisfied with the food ( our guests combined probably had every dietary restriction in the books!) We were very pleased with how delicious and diverse the food was, especially the Channa Masala! We would definitely recommend Club Los Meganos to any couple looking for their wedding venue!

We looked through and visited many Bay Area venues -- but in the end Los Meganos had everything we needed and more. The most important aspect is the 'customer service' that they...

provide. Every time I thought I might be asking for too much, Allyson and Katie said they would be happy to attempt it. And they succeeded and blew us away by all accounts. And our attendees loved it. (Many insisted it was the best wedding they've been to -- and who am I to question them?) Examples: \- Tweaking the menu substantially and memorably. Food is a big cost, and I didn't much want rolls and mashed potatoes found at most weddings across America. Their enthusiastic Chef crafted a Thai menu, complete with Thai spring rolls, yellow curry tofu, and even Thai iced tea -- which our guests completely loved. \- They worked with me to order local craft beer. Lots of positive comments on that Livermore brews. \- And they provided the option of self-made s'mores over an outdoor fire pit. We obviously took them up on that. Nothing cooler than hot flames at 10PM. All in all, that quenched the desires of this food-obsessed, value-conscious groom. This is all in addition to the detailed pre-planning and day-of execution to make the wedding feel less rushed and controlled by experienced hands. Staff is great. Location is beautiful, outside and in (think brand new four-star hotel.) Guests that had to drive a little ways understood why we picked the place upon arrival. Food is good. Price is right. Go look for yourself. So, to recap: It's all good. You don't have to have our wedding. They'll help you have your own.

My husband and I got married in October at Club Los Meganos. We had our rehearsal dinner there the night before also. Everything was spectacular and I had the wedding of my dream...

s. The food both nights was fabulous! "Cheffie" worked with us prior to our big event to make everything just as we wanted. Marc, the coordinator/event planner, was great! He helped us every step of the way and was readily available anytime we had questions. My mother and I had everything planned out the way I wanted my night to look, so we had lots of stuff brought in to set up. Marc worked with us to allow time for this and his staff helped out tremendously. Marc did a great job, along with my DJ Kevin Sequira, to keep us on our timeline and help the reception flow. My guests were so impressed with the venue, from the ceremony site to the reception. We had a buffet dinner for over 140 people, everyone said how great the food was. The food was hot and tasty and the buffet line went quick and smooth. I had many wedding guests tell me that Marc and his staff were on top of everything, from cleaning to checking on the guests. The reception room was gorgeous with the lighting in the room along with my DJ's lighting. The reception room doors slide open to get that open air affect, which is one of the things that drew me to this venue. The guests had many areas to hang out, from the reception room to the couches to the fire pit, making this a very big venue. Although the wedding was a Friday night, guests scattering a little early, everyone said what a great time they had! I would definitely recommend this venue for a wedding and reception.

We held our wedding reception at Club Los Meganos in April 2012, and we couldn't have been happier and more satisfied with the whole process, from visiting the venue to ending the ...

night with our third "last dance" (Marc Valone, the event coordinator for this site gave us an extra 20 mins because our guests weren't ready for it to be over). The venue was beautifully lit and decorated (just with what they provide, we really didn't bring anything in except our flowers, which wasn't much), and our guests enjoyed the opportunity to sit around the fire pit and catch up with one another, while enjoying the well maintained floral gardens and out door bar ran by two friendly bartenders that stayed on top of the crowd through out the whole evening. The best part of this venue for me was the way they handled the planning process. It was important for me that I felt comfortable with the venue and that I got a feeling of organization and ease with the coordinator and staff. Party planning is not my strong suit, and I felt like Marc Valone (event coordinator for the venue) made everything so easy. He was easy to communicate with (especially through email, which I prefer), he was very flexible with all of our requests and concerns, and I felt like he had total control of the whole evening, and between him and our DJ, they made everything run smoothly. On a final note, I would just like to mention how much our guests enjoyed this venue. Everyone loved the food (we did a buffet for about 130 people, 14 tables, it took about 20 mins for everyone to get their food), everyone kept mentioning how beautiful this place was, and several of our guests have told us that they had an amazing time and they are looking into holding their next family/work function at CLub Los Meganos.
