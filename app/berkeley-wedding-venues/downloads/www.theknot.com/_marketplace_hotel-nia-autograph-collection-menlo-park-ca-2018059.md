I was assisted by Cris-ann to help us book the presidential suite and one of their premium suites to get ready for our wedding. This was hands-down the best accommodation I've ever...

stayed at here in the Bay Area. The bridal party got ready in the presidential suite, and we were able to take some amazing photos around the hotel and in our room (That's me in the yellow dress!). They serve some delicious coffee and had really great in-room dining. The presidential suite really is worth every penny. You get a beautiful view, high-end fixtures that really create an ambient experience, and the bathroom is top-notch and I dream about it often! We did not have the ceremony here, but many memories were made and every time I drive by on 101, I think back to the incredible hospitality and dream of our next stay there.

My wife and I did a room block for our wedding at Hotel Nia. Though we didn't have our event at the Hotel, it would have been an absolutely brilliant venue to do so. The Hotel was ...

very accommodating for our families and went the extra mile to make sure every guest was taken care of. I would highly recommend Nia. The staff was pleasant and the booking of the rooms was extremely easy and intuitive for the guests. Cris-Ann was a pleasure to work with and Eddie Diano did a good job. Overall, the entire process was phenomenal, from the front desk experience to lounging by the pool with cocktails. The one thing I would recommend that we didn't do, was HAVE YOUR WEDDING HERE. I think I'll be regretting that we didn't have the ceremony at Nia, but don't tell the wife!

We had celebrated our daughters wedding in July that included multiple events over three days, each event requiring a whole new entirely different set up for a large number of gues...

ts around 250 most of them staying in the hotel . It was a celebration that included a bridal ceremony, Baraat on a horse entering so elegantly through the elephant gate, a groom’s welcome ceremony in the court yard, a Hindu wedding ceremony, two lunch Buffets in restaurant and foyer, buses to catholic church and back for a catholic ceremony, cocktail hour, dinner reception, late night snacks and drinks and two breakfasts . We had our final meeting with Jasmine, the catering sales manager of Nia on Tuesday and she presented to us every single detail with maps which gave us tremendous comfort . As our guests arrived at Nia on Thursday and Friday they were greeted very warmly by the staff with Champagne and chocolates . As they entered their rooms their welcome baskets and special gifts were already placed in the rooms by the Nia staff under the leadership of front desk manager Mustafa who is fantastic and still remembered by name by our guests after three months. Jason their audio visual guy was excellent in making sure there were enough speakers in the ball room as well as in the courtyard and fully in control with his staff making sure the correct music played for each occasion in all areas and this included two live bands and multiple change overs of recorded music . The table set ups both indoor and outdoor that required change for each event were done expertly, efficiently and looked fabulous and the staff were so attentive to our guests. Guests had so much fun with several options all through the weekend - to dance in the ball room , to chat in the foyer, sit around the fire pits in courtyard , play games and more during the entire weekend. The rooms and the decor in the hotel were very modern and the openness of the outdoor courtyard with its very distinctive animal figurines brought a unique touch . We felt that every single detail was taken care of and many guests remarked that it was the best wedding they have been to . Our experience as parents of the bride at Nia was extraordinary and we have wonderful memories for a life time.
