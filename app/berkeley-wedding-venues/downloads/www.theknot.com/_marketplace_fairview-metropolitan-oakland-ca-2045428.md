Trish was also incredibly kind to us, staying on top of every detail, of which there were countless.

e moment we started planning to the very last dance, she went above and beyond to make sure every detail was perfect. She kept us calm, handled everything behind the scenes, and made the entire experience so seamless that we were able to simply enjoy our wedding day. Trish is truly the reason we had our dream wedding, and we cannot thank her enough for the care, dedication, and heart she put into making it all happen. Our families and guests were blown away by how beautiful, organized, and smooth the entire celebration was. Everyone was so impressed with the venue, and we received endless compliments throughout the night. On top of that, the food was absolutely delicious — huge shout out to Chef Maria and staff. Fairview Metropolitan gave us the most unforgettable day, with a level of service and quality that far exceeded our expectations. The best part? It was affordable for the value we received. We couldn’t recommend this venue, and especially Trish, more highly for anyone planning their wedding.

iately understood our vision. Then they went to work bringing it to life. Everything was just perfect from communication to professionalism. Each staff member and associated vendor was wonderful from the DJ, to the bartender, the decor, dessert provider, dinner, EVERYTHING was just amazing. Were I looking to hold a wedding or reception, this would be the first place that I would look. You will search no further. How can you pass on perfection? Our guests simply raved about the food, and beautiful outdoor views. Just walking up to the door of the event looked so elegant. The DJ was a total hit. Our guests enjoyed his personality and jokes as well as his music. We all danced as much as we could. Let’s not forget the phenomenal bartender. Wow! And she actually knew what our signature cocktail was and was beyond expert . Once again, she was a complete crowd pleaser. But most importantly, Fairview staff is to be commended on their responsiveness. Each request, email, question was answered in a timely, professional, friendly manner. We always felt cared for and cared about.

tail in between! She was amazing to work with, she was clear, communicative, friendly and organized which is everything you want when you are planning your wedding! When I arrived at my reception I was blown away by the decor and how beautiful every detail was! Thank you so much Angela for all of your hard work and support in making my dream reception!!! The vendors that are connected to Fairview that I opted into having was DJ Keel and Ting at Montclair Florist. DJ Keel was a phenomenal MC and met with us ahead of time to get an idea of how we wanted our wedding MC'd as well as what we wanted our music to be like and let me tell you he achieved it!!! My guests were laughing, entertained and raving about the music all night! Thank you Dj Keel! I coordinated with Ting from Montclair Florist and although we did not talk much I have to say my bouquet and center pieces were the most beautiful flower arrangements I have ever seen! The flowers were stunning and she ran with the ideas I had and made it the most beautiful arrangement ever!! My guests were raving about the food and we were so supported by KeeKee our Banquet Manager! She checked in on us and made sure we were good throughout our reception! Book with Fairview you will not regret it the venue is beautiful and open, the tented pavilion is gorgeous, the food is delicious and the staff are phenomenal!!! Thank you Fairview for making the reception of my dreams!!!!

Was searching for a venue for my mom's celebration of life and made a list of venues that could support 100+ guests. Fairvew Metro was NOT on the top of the list because I thought...

a) Did not want a venue on golf course b) did not want a venue in San Leandro/Oakland c) did not want a venue in a tent. Boy was I proven wrong! We checked out all major venues in San Leandro, San Ramon, Hayward and Sunol and this was by far the nicest facility that offered total flexibility and very, very personalized service. Despite having years of experience and many venues under their belts, Angela and Trish were NOT jaded like many of the other venues. They worked on every little detail, and always followed up with a detailed email of changes. They made great recommendations and made sure everything was perfect. The venue was very nice and parking was very safe and convenient. The tent was VERY classy, with lights and decorations. The table settings were very modern and every staff member from server, to bartender, to coordinator were there to make sure everything went off without a hitch. Fairview had the best value for the money and Angela and Trish gave us confidence that the event would be perfect, which it was. Thanks for a very memorable event we will tell all our friends and family.

l set up/service venue which was one of our deciding factors to have our daughter's quinceañera there. It is easy to access and has ample parking. The venue was spacious for our 180 guests and there was ample room to dance. The service was TOP-NOTCH. We loved working with both Trish Sena and Angela Muse, who made this process so easy and memorable. They were so easy to talk to and work with. Both worked so hard to go above and beyond to make our daughter's vision a fairytale reality. We couldn't have been happier with the outcome. Their attention to detail was impeccable. Making our event spectacular. Several of our guests mentioned how this was the event of the year. We never felt pressured (as we did at some other locations) or overcharged. Chef Maria did an amazing job with the food. Our daughter is an extremely picky eater, went back for seconds (which NEVER happens). So many of our guests commented on how delicious the food was. I had two relatives call after the quinceañera to ask who the food caterer was so they could book them for their upcoming gatherings. We had two bartenders working that day who were delightful. Both were quick, polite and pleasant. The Banquet Captain Kiki was on point. She didn’t skip a beat. We are still dizzy with delight as to how perfect and dazzling our event was and we owe it all to Fairview Metropolitan.

And when they were out on leave, they were sure to communicate that to me and who to contact in their absence. I just love working with an efficient team. They have quite the selection of packages that can really tailor your needs and your budget. Now, my all time favorite part about this venue is the scenery. The outdoor background was spacious and made our pictures full of greenery with the Bay Area in the background. The reception was held in an enlarged tent that we adorned with draperies and colored lighting from our DJ that made the room "pop" with color. This venue is your one stop shop from everything from decorations, budget, and professionalism.

hly and timely, and checking in over the course of the months we were planning to make sure everything was in line. I'm especially thankful since I know often wedding planning causes high-stress levels, but while there were times of stress for us, for the most part that really wasn't our experience, so I'm grateful for all the help along the way! We had our ceremony at a different location so it could be inside (December evening is a little too cold for an outdoor wedding, plus it happened to rain that weekend), but still, getting to the location and parking at this reception site was easy for our guests, so it didn't seem to be a problem at all. The reason I give four stars instead of five is that on the day it seemed a little hard to find people to ask questions too. We didn't need much - they really did do an amazing job setting everything up, there were just a few random questions that came up, and we were missing the cake-cutting kit, and little things like that. It all worked out for sure though, and I definitely recommend this place as a nice, beautiful, and straightforward wedding reception venue!

Our daughter had her wedding and reception here at Fairview Metropolitan back in 2017 (review 9/23/2017 Barbara M). We were so pleased with our experience with the Fairview staff a...

nd the event itself (absolute perfection), we decided to hold our parents’ Celebration of Life here. This review is in regards to the COL, however we believe the expertise and quality service provided by Fairview would apply to any event and/or function. We held our parents' Celebration of Life at Fairview Metropolitan on July 30, 2021. Event planning is ultra stressful and the pandemic just added to the mix. However, Angela Muse (our event director) made the process so effortless. She had so many helpful suggestions and was a true joy to work with. Very professional and courteous. With her assistance, we were able to customize a package that truly honored our parents' memory. This reception was held right after the church and burial services. We decided on appetizers, bar service and buffet dinner for 150 guests. The funeral services took almost 3 hours. By the time we got to Fairview, everyone was pretty hungry. When we arrived, all the appetizers and the bar service were ready and our guests were able to enjoy them right away. Appetizers were fabulous (I highly recommend the Ahi Tuna Tartar). The venue itself was beautifully set up. This was an afternoon event (no mood lighting) but it still had an elegant feel to it. We were also able to drop off the seating chart and pictures of our parents the day before our event (Fairview provided the easels). One less thing to do the day of the funeral. The buffet dinner was delicious and there was enough so that our guests could go for seconds if they wanted. Kudos to Kathy our bartender! Super friendly and kind. We felt so lucky to have her there. We had a video presentation and a Hula Show. We also had our brothers sing some songs and wanted to allot time for guests to pay tribute to our parents. DJ Andrew made all this happen. He provided the music, mikes, speakers and projection screen. The funeral ran long, and we arrived to the venue almost 45 minutes late. We were worried we'd go overtime with all we wanted to do, but DJ Andrew didn't let that happen. We were able to do all the presentations within our 4 hour time slot. He moved everything along so smoothly and didn't make it feel rushed. The dinner music was spot on for our family. We used the dance floor for the Hula Show and the singing which worked out perfectly. At the close of the event, he played 'Lovely Day'. That got everyone on the dance floor! He had mentioned to us that Celebrations of Life don't necessarily have to be sad occasions. He was right. Although we were sad to lose our parents, DJ Andrew made our event an unforgettable and true celebration of their lives. Many thanks to you DJ Andrew! Angela and the crew at Fairview Metropolitan really know their stuff. Our family is so grateful to them. Highly recommend this venue. Excellent, flexible and professional service. Oh and did I mention, plenty of free parking? Enough said.

attentiveness and communication. Having so many small and big details to decide on, choosing Fairview was by far the best and easiest because of the all inclusive deals they offered. The food was delish and the service was the best! Shout out to our bartender, unfortunately didn’t get her name, but she personally made sure my husband and I had a drink all night. Our guests even raved about her! DJ Keel was awesome, had our guests on the dance floor ALL NIGHT!! Angela was by far the sweetest, most attentive coordinator you can ask for (highly recommend to add a day of coordinator) it was a pleasure from the very beginning of planning with her, I felt like she understood our vision. I could go on and on about how amazing everything turned out. Be sure to check out Fairview yourself, they do not disappoint!! Thank you Fairview for the wedding of our dreams!!

The Fairview Metropolitan wedding team was awesome! Special thank you to Myra for taking care of us. The process went smooth and there wasn't any hiccups. Myra knows her job well. ...

Communication was always ongoing and positive. I would recommend any couple who is looking for a wedding venue to visit Fairview Metropolitan and also attend one of their wedding fairs. Their vendors are great. We ended up using 5 of their vendors. Fairview's wedding packages are reasonable for anyone looking for a budget wedding or an extravagant wedding. You are also able to customize your package to your liking. Our wedding consisted of 220 guests. Me and my wife were a little worried that there wouldn't be enough space, but to our surprise we were happy that the reception area was not over crowded. People were able to move around comfortably. Special shout out to the bar tenders on my wedding night. We had an open bar. I was worried that the line would be super long, but that was not the case. The bartenders managed to keep the line moving and everyone was happy. So happy that the bar ran out of Hennessy and Jameson lol.

We ended up booking our wedding here and the venue gives you a wedding binder to help you stay on track. They also have recommendation for vendors you need and a list to help you stay on track. Like I said Myra would email and call to make sure I was comfortable with all the little details and was on top of everything. The day of the wedding it was everything I could image it to be. Everything from the flowers, tables, centerpieces, food, dj, scheduling was on great ! We had so much fun they basically had to tell us it was ending. The salmon that nice was delicious ! Overall, I had a great experience with this venue for the little time I had planning my wedding.

loved this venue! the packages sold me and my husband. I had the best wedding coordinator who is Myra and Brittney. I originally was supposed to have my wedding in Cancun but had...

to cancel due to an family emergency, so i had to choose a venue and plan everything within 6 months. Myra made it happen! She went out of her way to do whatever she can to help me get through my stressful and frustrating wedding. At the end of the day my wedding turned out beautiful! loved every moment of it. Thank you again!

We held our wedding reception here in June 2018. We were absolutely blown away by the level of service, the execution, and the overall outcome of our reception on the big day. We f...

elt fortunate to have found this place on the budget that we had. All of the other venues we went to significantly priced us out and they hadn't included all the things Fairview contractually included: food, drinks, floral centerpieces, MC/DJ, and the YUMMY wedding cake, all with quality products and service of these third party vendors. Our guest count was 110 people of our very close family and friends. One of the significant compliments we received of our wedding was that the food & beverage staff were very attentive, super friendly, and fun! From the wait staff, bartender, the MC/DJ, and our coordinator, our guests loved them. My husband and I could attest to that in how we were treated that day. We absolutely loved the service. Our coordinator Claire really took care of business! One last thing I'll add is that this place is a beautiful all-white venue. It's a blank slate and a fresh canvas for you to lay your vision and freely create this day that you've dreamt of with details of your own and/or with the of the wide variety of options that Fairview provides. I highly recommend this place. Thank you guys for everything and helping me create the wedding I've always dreamed of to my high school sweetheart. :)

anted from the beginning. Even when we came with a low budget, they were able to give us the best of the services and look for the best options. The day of the party was a very hot day, and right away they brought 4 big AC units into the venue to keep all of our guest happy and comfortable. The food was amazing!

Our daughter and new son-in-law's wedding & reception was held here on Sept 16, 2017. Absolutely magical! Although management changed hands several times during the planning (we co...

ntracted with them in January 2016) ultimately the wedding party was everything we could hope for. Our coordinator Claire was flawless. She made sure every detail was fulfilled. She even stepped in when the carving station person was called away! Impressive. Kept our guests moving at the buffet. And the food was tasty and plentiful. One small overlook, at dinnertime the wine was not at the tables. We alerted Claire, and she handled it immediately. Claire, you rock! DJ/MC Andrew kept the event on schedule and the party lively. The dance floor was jumping the entire night! Great fun! Keegan our florist created dazzling bouquets and centerpieces. My daughter wanted a tropical themed wedding and that's exactly what she got. Our bartenders were friendly and accommodating. And the wedding cake was sweet, moist, and delicious. This is one stop shopping for wedding planning and we were in professional, courteous, and capable hands. Kudos to the set up crew, who broke down the event held right before ours, and beautifully arranged the space before the start of our reception. Wedding planning is stressful. If you'd like to eliminate ALOT of that stress, book your wedding here. Oh one last thing, the Bridal party left our purses and cell phones in the bride’s waiting room. Nothing fancy, but we were able to bring in champagne and vodka and hide the bride from the groom. AND... after the ceremony when I went to get my purse, the door was locked, and a very considerate lady asked me who I was, let me in, and said we keep this room locked because we know there are valuables here and want to be sure they're safe. Service felt very personalized. The staff at Fairview Metropolitan invest in making your dream event come true. I recommend them 100%. And as an added plus, there's plenty of free parking.

We had our wedding at Fairview Metropolitan several weeks ago. While we were happy with how our overall ceremony turned out, there were some major issues with management (Julie) th...

at prevented us from giving this venue a higher rating. An overview of the problems we had with the venue are described below, but please refer to the link to my google doc for details and a comprehensive review. This venue has many positive points that I want to acknowledge as well. Overview of the issues: 1\. Ten days before our wedding, we were told that we would be charged another $500 for a service that was promised to be included in the charge from the time of the signing of the contract. 2\. We were told DURING our reception that we were above our guest count (we were not as we had several no-shows) and would be charged for the additional people. 3\. We paid for twinkle lights to be turned on in the reception tent. This service was not only not provided, but they insisted that they were on when we asked about them after the wedding. Please refer to the following googledoc for details and a comprehensive review. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dU5vGO9i2qhnnAbtrtmdNzIt7H6baLl9Y2s2eeknUlI/edit?usp=sharing

After planning my wedding with this venue for 7 months, I ended up having to request my deposit back because they were not honest about their pricing OR flexibility. After manageme...

nt told me that the food at this location was NOT very good and those were the managers EXACT words, I inquired further about using an outside vendor. Julie of course denied ever telling me that the food was not good, but I had absolutely no reason to make something like that up. Previously I was told that it was okay as long as I met their $4K minimum. What this venue does not tell you is that the outside caterer has ZERO access to their kitchen, not even to leave excess food in it. In addition the $4K minimum is a crock. For $4K you are charged basically for their tables, chairs, and linens, in addition to the facility fee they charge depending on the day your wedding is on, on top of the ceremony fee. If you have upgrades, removing their food means you lose their "discounted" pricing so everything is a la carte. I was going to end up paying them $8K when I wasn't even going to use their food, have them supply my floral, wedding cake, etc. Make sure you read your contract and ASK plenty of questions. Julie was not a pleasure to work with whatsoever. Over the phone she sounds really sweet in caring, but in person she is condescending and RUDE. Erin is sweet, but she really needs to work on her organization. As a bride, you want someone who will take the stress off of you, but when you have to double and triple check every little thing they do, it becomes annoying. Had I been offered options to rectify the situation before things just became the way they did, I would still be booked here, but unfortunately the staff here just isn't trained properly and I had to request my deposit back.

It was the best day ever for the both of us. It took place over two months ago and I still remember mostly everything. The venue was great. Erin was so helpful and patient. The foo...

d was fantastic. The music was on point and DJ Andrew was a great host! It felt like a dream. One of the best things that happened was when Erin called to express her apologies when we did get to take food home which was due to the fact that we did not get to eat (because everyone wants time). They did something extra special for us! And that was gold!!

Wedgewood offers great packages at affordable prices. We stayed within budget but never felt that we had to give up anything to do it! The service level from beginning to end made ...

it virtually stress free. We had a consultant/planner, Kristen, who was so helpful and caring. She made sure we had answers to our questions and was flexible on the specifics we had. We did have a few hiccups as all weddings do, but the venue was helpful and accommodating to help us resolve them. There was no option for food tasting prior to the wedding, which was a concern, but the food was amazing. So many of our guests have told us how delicious it was! I am so happy we chose Wedgewood!
