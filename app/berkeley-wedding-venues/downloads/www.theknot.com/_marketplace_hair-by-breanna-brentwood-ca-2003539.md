nd stress-free. Everyone in my bridal party loved their hair — she worked quickly without ever sacrificing detail or quality. I was originally on the hunt for a new stylist and loved her work so much that I now see her regularly for my maintenance and touchups. Her style is modern, on-trend, and beautiful, and the pricing compared to other vendors was such a pleasant surprise. I’d recommend her and her team to any bride looking for someone reliable, talented, and genuinely enjoyable to work with!

s going to come out so good. I mean, if her IG doesn’t speak for itself, then idk what to say lol (@hairbybreanna_) First of all, she came on time to the bridal suite and did 8 of my bridesmaids’ hair + mine by herself and she was so fricken fast, it was insane. I want to say she did it in like, less than 4.5 hours or something insane like that. I feel like it was actually less lmao, and her braiding skills are out of this world. We’re not just talking about just your normal French braid or fishtail braid people!!! She has funky braids down too. Idk how she manipulates hair the way she does, but it’s magic and she’s so talented. She also came with everything too--curler, hairspray, & tons of bobby pins! What’s super great about Breanna is she also has her own salon in Brentwood too... So for anyone that wants to have their hair colored or want extensions for their wedding, it’s perfect that you can go to her for that service too before your wedding day and she can carry out your vision for your wedding hair (I decided last minute to do extensions myself but at another salon due to scheduling conflict, but Breanna still killed it in styling my hair). Overall, highly recommend, 10/10 for Breanna. I’m so happy she did my hair for my wedding!!!

entire process. I used clip in extensions and Breanna had no problem cutting/blending them before she styled my hair which made such a big difference in my hair looking full, but still natural. I highly recommend Breanna for your wedding (or literally any other event as well). My hair lasted the entire night of dancing, drinking, photos, etc. and my curls even looked good the next morning when we went wine tasting! Thank you so much Breanna for being apart of my special day.

I found Breanna on the Knot and was able to book a trial with her. I showed her a picture of how I wanted my hair to look and during the first try she nailed it. On the day of our ...

wedding she did all 6 of my bridesmaids hair, 2 moms and a jr bridesmaid. All of which came out looking flawless. I could not have picked a better person to do my wedding hair or my bridal parties hair. Everybody loved their hair so much! I would recommend hiring Breanna to any bride! Thank you again so much Breanna!

Breanna is incredibly talented! I was lucky enough to have her do my bridesmaids' and my hair for my wedding. She did an amazing job! All my bridesmaids couldn't stop talking about...

how much they loved their hair all day. She was able to do any style they requested to perfection and her braids are truly the best. Breanna is great to work with and I couldn't have been happier. She's the best!

I had the privilege of having Breanna style everybody’s hair for my wedding on 7/19/19, and let me tell you, she was amazing! Punctual and organized, she executed 7 hairstyles in 4...

hours. I had SO many people complimenting not just my hair, but everybody’s. PLUS I requested a style she had never done before and she pulled it off beautifully! I received so much praise for her work. I could not recommend Breanna more!

Breanna did wedding hair for myself, my daughter and her bridesmaids. She came to our hotel room, arrived early and quickly did all our hair beautifully. She was very professional ...

and did different styles based on what each girl wanted. She even did extensions on my daughter’s hair and firmly attached the hair combs. She was very reasonably priced and very friendly. Thank you for making this part of the wedding day easy.

Breanna was amazing! She arrived on time and prepared and finished 9 heads of hair so quickly! Most of the girls let her decide what to do based off their length of hair and the ba...

sic style they liked and every single person was so so happy with the final product! By the time it was my turn to get my hair done, I even adjusted some things from my initial trial because I loved what she was doing to all the other girls! She was so sweet and knows exactly how to do her job well! My hair stayed ALL night even after hours of dancing. I would recommend her for any event. She was truly amazing and I couldn’t be happier that she did my hair on my wedding day.

Breanna was absolutely amazing. She came to my house and was able to arrive earlier than we discussed as our plans slightly changed. My hair turned out amazing and it stayed all ni...

ght despite crazy dancing. My girls loved their hairs, especially braids. All 4 bridesmaids said this was the best wedding hair they had and how Breanna was able to add so much volume to their hair. On top of that, she is super fast so you won’t have to sit there for hours. I loved it! You won’t go wrong with Breanne.

at they wanted for hair, but Breanna was spot on with each of their inspo’s and she was QUICK. I was so impressed by how talented and efficient she is. Her braids are beautiful, she had to cut my bangs morning of for my look and didn’t miss a beat, we short circuited one outlet and she seamlessly found another area. She made me feel like nothing could get in the way of wedding day. I couldn’t reccommend her more.
