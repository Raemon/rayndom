efore the estimated delivery date! Rebekah was our lead photographer and she was a pleasure to work with, so nice! We had a very stormy day during our wedding and she arrived on time and early. The quality of the photos were wonderful and she captured authentic moments, as well as flattering angles, and utilized lighting to add an artistic flare to photos. We really wanted our dip captured at the end of the aisle and she literally sprinted to ensure we got it, and it was an EPIC photo. Our favorite one. We have not received our video yet as it is too early so we can’t comment on that but everyone from Sound Originals was very kind and organized on our wedding day and were inconspicuous during ceremony and reception. Thank you Rebekah and Sound Originals!

We couldn’t be happier with our photographer and videographer team from our October wedding. From start to finish, the experience was absolutely fantastic. Danny, our lead photogra...

pher, was incredible to work with—professional, personable, and clearly passionate about what he does. He did both our engagement photos and was present on our wedding day--making us feel comfortable all day and captured everything so naturally. The rest of the team—the additional photographer and videographer—were also wonderful. With all the chaos of the day itself, we truly appreciated their energy, attention to detail, and how seamlessly they worked together throughout the day. The turnaround time for both photos and video was excellent, and we were blown away by the final results. Every image and video brought us right back to the day, perfectly capturing the big moments as well as the candid, emotional ones in between. We loved everything about working with this team and are so grateful to have these memories preserved so beautifully. Highly recommend!

Our videographer, Jonathan, was professional and meticulous. He paid great attention to our requests and what we wanted for our video. We also had the flexibility to choose a song ...

from a large platform, which made the video feel more personal. As a bonus, Jonathan has an amazing voice and even sang us a song during our karaoke session, which was a fun and memorable touch. One thing to note is that the original package does not include revisions, so a few scenes we felt less satisfied with were included in the final video. Overall, we appreciated Jonathan and the Originals team’s dedication and creativity, and the experience was a positive one.

showed up on time prior to our ceremony. My photographer even had some great ideas for photos at my venue that I would have hated to miss. We got an excellent mix of candid and staged photos. Overall we are very happy with the product outcome. However, at least out of Roswell, Ga I felt that even though I filled out the questionnaires and timeline my professionals didn’t stick to it or know what and when things were happening. I felt like I was responsible for keeping everything on time and what to do next. My photographer showed up after me at our reception venue so se virtually had no cocktail hour pictures. I had a meeting with a planner one month prior to my wedding and we discussed all the details including drone filming but the drone was not completed when and where I had discussed. The videographer did not know that I wanted the drone footage at our reception location instead of our ceremony location. Things did feel unorganized for me personally but in the end our photos and videos were more than we could have asked for.

at being said, it’s worth noting that this is a photography company and you can’t talk with your lead photographer until a month before the wedding, and you can just talk with them once without paying extra. Also, communication with the company in the months leading up to the wedding felt disjointed as it’s through a portal. If you’re looking to not think too much about the specifics of your wedding photos, and just want someone to show up day of to capture the day, Original Weddings would be great. If you’d like more of a personalized touch with regular communication with your photographer prior to the wedding, I would recommend other options.

I would describe our experience with Original Weddings Chicago photography as extremely high-value and a strong contributor to the joy and seamlessness of our wedding day. For our ...

Wisconsin wedding, 7 hours and two photographers (their mid-tier package) was competitively priced and impressively executed; for our event, there could have been no better fit than photography from Original Weddings. From start to finish, our expectations were completely exceeded in every dimension by our assigned photographers, Shawn and Brock, who were easy and fun to work with, captured every moment incredibly, and seamlessly integrated their presence and work into the fabric of our event. They truly made the day about US and our story, and it was such a pleasure to feel in total control yet unstressed and effortlessly supported. They were extremely courteous, knowledgeable, and thorough in their presence and direction throughout the day, and our wedding gallery turned out in the exact style and to the highest caliber we hoped for (and at a price point that was truly ideal for us). The booking process, communication chain, and pre-wedding meeting(s) were among the easiest and most seamless we had with any of our vendors, and we appreciate how comprehensive their services and offerings were while keeping things simple and easy to parse for us as the couple. The number of hours and the level of talent we received from Original Weddings (particularly from Shawn and Brock as our photographers) were nothing short of perfect for us, and there is an excellent chance that it will be perfect for your wedding too. My wife and I are so grateful for every moment we got to work with this company and overjoyed with every result thereof, and if you’re planning your wedding, we encourage you to strongly consider Original Weddings, particularly if you have the chance to work with Shawn and/or Brock as your photographers. ~Stephen & Ciara

She was so kind, friendly, and patient, constantly checking in to make sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed. She helped pose us, guided us through shots, and managed to capture every moment so beautifully without ever feeling intrusive. You can tell she truly cares about her couples and about getting everything just right. And the videos… absolutely stunning. They captured the emotion, the energy, and all the little details that made our day special. We’re so grateful for the work and heart Anna put into our wedding she helped preserve memories we’ll cherish forever.

Our wedding was October 11, and we chose the two photographer package since it fit into our budget. We were so pleased with the photos! We were given plenty of direction in posing ...

(me and my husband are not models by any means so we need to be told what to do…), and we tested any spontaneous ideas that popped up which ended up working great! We had a great selection to choose from to the point I can’t pick which ones I want framed. Also, I believe the estimated time was 4-6 weeks, but we did get them early which was wonderful, and we got to look through them at our 1-month post wedding “anniversary”! The only regret I have which is not on the photographers is we did not get photos with my extended family.

If you are looking for a talented, professional, and reliable videographer you should definitely consider Original Weddings.

the whole planning process stress-free. Our videographer worked seamlessly with our photographer the entire day and made sure every moment was beautifully captured. The final video (delivered in under a month!) was perfect — it brings us right back to the day every time we watch it. The drone footage was such a fun bonus and something we were hoping for. Highly recommend, especially if you are debating whether you need a video or not. We were on the fence about it and I'm so glad we have a video of the highlights.

Going into the wedding planning process, my now husband and I didn’t have a strong vision for what we wanted in terms of photography. We just wanted to have lots of fun and end up ...

with some great candid shots. We chose Original Weddings because we really liked their Instagram photos, and they had pricing options that fit our budget comfortably. Their online platform and regular communication made the process super simple and straightforward. We met with the Original team and our photographer, Eugene, a month or so before the wedding, and gave him pretty much no direction except that we wanted a lot of candid shots. The day of the wedding, he was on point. He got amazing candid shots, but also recommended certain group photos or locations for us to shoot throughout the evening. We are so thrilled with how our photos turned out, and owe it all to Eugene’s guidance, skill, and professionalism.

I am very, very happy with our decision in choosing Original Wedding photo and video for my wedding. We got married at Calamigos ranch in Malibu. They were there from 2 PM to 10 PM...

. We got to do all of my bridal shots, my close and detailed shots of my ring and my dress, bridesmaid shots, groomsmen shots, and so much more. My husband and I had a lot of traditions we wanted to be emphasized, and I can’t begin to describe how amazing the photos turned out. We had a military sword arch, private vows, and Jewish traditions, and they were all captured beautifully. I asked the photographer if they could take subtle photos of us reading our vows together because we wanted to do it in private, but I wanted to still capture the moment, and they were able to give us our privacy while we read our vows. At the end of the readings, we thought they had left because they were so quiet! However, they were hiding behind a plant and the photos turned out so raw, emotional, and beautiful. It was exactly our vision. Not only was their whole team very easy to talk to, but also they were very nice and very attentive. I also thought that their pricing was extremely reasonable, especially for Los Angeles. I could not recommend them enough!!!!

ght it to life — the drone footage was especially epic! We can’t wait to see the final gallery and relive every moment through their lens. Their style is cinematic yet deeply personal — every frame feels intentional, romantic, and full of movement. Teddy (Lead Photo) and Gabby (Second Photo) captured not just the big moments, but the quiet, emotional ones too, with an eye for light and composition that made everything look editorial-worthy. Jem (Lead Video) and Feddy (Second Video) brought such positive energy to the day — they were everywhere and nowhere all at once, capturing magic without ever interrupting the flow. You could feel their passion in every interaction, and it was contagious. Our other vendors kept commenting on how much they loved working alongside them — they were collaborative, respectful, and made everyone feel like part of the story. We’re so grateful to have had this dream team documenting our day.

endly and easy to talk to, and they really listened to what we wanted. I had a few specific shots in mind, I had an art piece commissioned and wanted to recreate it and the photographer made sure we were able to. The picture came out stunning! It ended up raining on our wedding day, and I was worried it would prevent us from taking some good pictures, but they totally embraced it and somehow made the rain look magical. The photos turned out so beautiful and natural, and you can tell they genuinely care about what they do. They were a pleasure to work with both day off with the photographer and when I messaged them with any questions or any extras I wanted added. If you’re looking for a photographer who’s not only talented but also kind, patient, and just great to be around, I can’t recommend enough. The pictures came out beautiful and it was so smooth and easy both on my wedding day and any questions I had before and after. I’m so glad I chose them!

otographers based on their portfolio. But we were extremely lucky to have a great photographer Ken here in the Chicagoland area for our engagement photos and he was also there for our wedding. The day of our wedding we had a second photographer who was great and the two worked well together. My reason for 4 stars is I feel like being able to communicate with the actual photographer before the wedding and having to go through someone else to pass along the message kinda stinks. We had asked what they wanted to eat and they do not actually ask the photographers beforehand like we asked which we felt bad about. I wish they would offer photo shopping even if it was an additional cost. But again thankfully we had photographers who did their best knowing we had to do a quick change of plans for family pictures. All and all happy we had great photographers. Just keep in mind they contract photographers and you have a middle man to handle all the details

From our initial consulting call to the planning portal and day of services, this was a top tier experience. One of the things I was so worried about was if the photographer and video team that were assigned to us were no good..or at least wouldn't fit our style. That was certaintly not the case and we loved Teodor, Dennis, and David. Planning my wedding from out of town was not fun by any means, but working with the original weddings team made it seamless!!

Original Weddings truly outdid themselves when it came to capturing our day — both in photo and video form! We opted for two photographers and one videographer, and we couldn’t be ...

happier with the results. We were initially told to expect our photos and videos within 4–6 months, but to our surprise, we received everything in less than two weeks after the wedding! Our lead photographer, Steve (or Steven), was wonderful — full of energy, creative, and so intentional with every shot he took. Aspen, our second photographer, perfectly captured all the little details and candid moments we might have missed. It was such a gift to see the empty room and venue shots that we didn’t get to take in during the day. Our videographer, Wen (apologies if I’ve spelled that incorrectly), was equally amazing. He captured the joy, the laughter, and all the meaningful speeches that we’ll cherish forever. Original Weddings exceeded every expectation, and we highly recommend them. After researching and comparing multiple vendors, we found their pricing and quality to be unmatched. We loved working with them — and if we could re-hire them, we absolutely would!
