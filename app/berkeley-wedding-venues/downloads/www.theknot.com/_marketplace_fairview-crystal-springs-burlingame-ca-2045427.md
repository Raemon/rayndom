re incredibly organized, responsive, and genuinely invested in making our day perfect. Planning from afar could have been stressful, but their professionalism, warmth, and attention to detail made the process seamless and enjoyable. Our wedding day itself was absolutely magical. Every detail came together beautifully, from the breathtaking views and decor to the flawless coordination that kept everything running smoothly. Avonne’s floral designs, especially our centerpieces and sweetheart table arrangement, were stunning. DJ Storm brought so much life and energy to the reception; our guests never left the dance floor! We honestly couldn’t have asked for a better team. The Fairview Crystal Springs staff made our dream wedding a reality, and we’ll cherish these memories forever. Thank you for going above and beyond to make our day special! ~Gen & Cai

Nikki and Lindsay were wonderful to work with. They were very empathetic and guided us every step of the way. Responses to our questions via email were responded within a few hours...

of sending. They are experienced and very welcoming / positive in all our interactions, email and in-person. They made our wedding day very easy. I highly recommend them. The ceremony location was beautiful. The view was amazing! Our photographer, Andy, (who was recommended by Fairview) was also wonderful to work with. He knows the location very well and all the best lighting angles. Can't wait to see the photos. DJ Shawn was great during the ceremony and reception. He was a fun and effective MC; he made appropriate impromptu timeline adjustments and honored guests' song requests. He has been very busy so our preparation meeting call with him was very brief. We went with our own vendor for the flowers. Because we had our own vendor for the gazebo spray, Fairview would not bring that to our sweetheart table after the ceremony. We had our friends do that for us. Food was pretty good. Appetizers were awesome, though the hot foods (salmon and short ribs) were a bit dry. We went with the buffet. There was a line because there was a hold up with people waiting for their slice of prime rib to be cut. Maybe they could have two people cutting instead? Our guests had a wonderful time. We had a wonderful time. We highly recommend this venue for your wedding.

what truly made our day unforgettable was the exceptional service and attention to detail from the entire team. Valerie, our coordinator, was an absolute rockstar! She went above and beyond to ensure every detail was taken care of, and her expertise and guidance made the planning process seamless. The rest of the team was equally impressive, with friendly and attentive service throughout the entire event. The food was delicious, the drinks were flowing, and the atmosphere was magical. We received countless compliments from our guests on the beauty of the venue and the exceptional service. We can't thank Fairview Crystal Springs enough for making our wedding day truly unforgettable. If you're looking for a venue that will exceed your expectations in every way, look no further! *Rating:* 5/5 stars *Recommendation:* Don't hesitate to book Fairview Crystal Springs for your special day. The team is exceptional, and the venue is truly breathtaking."

whole team for almost holding the ceremony outside until the weather no longer permitted. Lindsay gave us weather updates throughout the day on March 11, 2023 until our evening ceremony. The amazing team hauled all the décor from the outdoor ceremony site into the reception area a mile down the road. Lindsay coordinated another rehearsal with the wedding party indoors to make the day as perfect as it could be. Avonne Lee of Rosedale floral design took extra time to make the indoor ceremony BEAUTIFUL! She made gorgeous arrangements to decorate the metal arch indoors provided by Fairview, that was later displayed on our sweetheart table. Avonne provided extra petals to line the aisle and meticulously designed our stacked guava cake from Mazzetti’s. She definitely executed our ideal “romantic and elegant” wedding. Photographer Andy Hasak of Everlasting Capture came early to the bridal suite even though he had just photographed another wedding that morning! While the weather wasn’t the best, he made great efforts to photograph us outdoors in the gazebo. Andy uploaded all photos and mailed our prints much sooner than expected! The photos are incredible! The banquet team leader, Alex, took great care of us at the sweetheart table, always checking in to see if we needed anything. DJ Ken Brown of Storm productions took our requests and created an amazing dance party, he’s a lively MC to get the crowd excited. This all-inclusive wedding package (Elite) at Fairview Crystal Springs was an amazing experience!

h. They always had positive, professional, and friendly attitudes. Very approachable, quick responses to my requests and concerns, and they were always eager to help. They troubleshooted and problem-solved when necessary, handling every one of our dealings with poise, ease, and a great big smile! With a mere 6 months to plan, they truly took a lot of the stress off my shoulders. Every staff member from the chefs, Alex the banquet manager were outstanding! As a result, they executed my vision. The buffet dinner was delicious and plentiful. DJ Shawn Storm knew exactly what he was doing and was super fun, played great songs and kept us on schedule. The service, including bartenders, did an outstanding job too! I received so many comments and compliments from guests for the venue and service. It was one of the worst storms that night, and the staff was able to rally and make last minute decisions to ensure, comfort, safety and that a great time was had by all. A big thank you and high recommendation to Fairview Crystal Springs!

Our wedding was on 11/18/2022. This venue 110% BENDS over backwards to accommodate all your needs and requests. I'll be honest: I booked this venue before reading reviews and I was...

really nervous after reading all the negative ones, but our wedding went off wonderfully! The only negative I could think of was one of the tables was missing a chair, but they got my guest the missing chair right away. Yes, there were hiccups along the way: sometimes they respond a bit slow, but they always get back to you; they told me that I could have 2 carving stations, but it had to be reduced to 1 when my wedding was only 10 days away. They were able to have the meat pre-cut and placed into a chafer and added to the buffet line. My guests could not stop raving about the food and I also thought the food was really amazing!! They do not offer private food tastings, instead they have a bi-annual FREE wedding fair for all future brides. I could not attend because I live across the country, but they let me invite 2 of my bridesmaids + 1 bridesmaid fiance to go in my place instead (I think they offer up to 4-6 tickets per bride). Based on what my bridesmaids said I picked what they said was good and avoided the ones that they said were bad. They were also kind enough to let me bring in a few traditional cultural dishes! This venue is all inclusive, but from the past reviews, I ended up hiring my own DJ, wedding day-of-coordinator, bakery for cake and florist. I also hired my own lighting which included a backdrop on the dancefloor. It was a lot more work, but I think this may have been why I was much more satisfied and happy with this venue. One thing that I recommend to all brides is make sure all your rules/requests are IN your BEO (banquet event order)!! They followed this to the T and I am very happy because I also had some cultural rules in the list. If you're looking to have a multicultural wedding, I would say this place is perfect for it! I really felt like they respected both cultures by accommodating all my requests.

First of all, let's start with the week prior to the wedding. We get a call from the DJ who was surprised that we didn't submit our playlist and the pre-wedding form online. We wer...

e surprised too because no one had informed us of anything or procedure to follow for this and were anxiously waiting with no info. The DJ was surprised and expressed how he was going to give management a call to investigate. On to the wedding. I, the groom get to the ceremony site and the gate is BROKEN! There was a maintenance crew servicing the gate so I call the venue's event coordinators (Angelique Taylor & Lindsay Ohira) at the number provided and nobody picked up my numerous calls. Literally no one. Not one person answered. The mechanics working on the gate blocked off the entrance to the ceremony and we had to talk to them to let us in while they worked on the gate. So I, the groom, get to the gazebo where my wife and I were going to say (I do) and it was NOT cleaned up from the event prior. How do I know this? Because I was there the day prior for the rehearsal and it still looked the same from whatever event occurred before. There were tons of zipties ALL over the gazebo and I had to clean it up myself in my tuxedo to give our venue a modicum of cleanliness for our guests and pictures. In addition, the chair set up were unusually far from the gazebo (even the DJ commented on how unusual that was, and he's been with the venue for years). Likewise, there were more chairs than expected (+10 more) even though our guests were less than 35 and Fairview crystal springs were aware of the final guest count days before the wedding. I had to tell our guests personally to all move up a row just so it would look decent when my wife walked down the isle and in pictures, a task Fairview should be doing not me. Likewise, this is the worst part of this whole ordeal. There was ZERO communication or availability from the event directors (Angelique Taylor & Lindsay Ohira) to myself regarding the things aforementioned above. I called the event director(s) +14 times, and they NEVER picked up the phone not once, just sent me to voicemail EVERY SINGLE TIME even though I know they were in the office because it was around 3.15 pm and that was around the time my wife was in the bridal suite and she saw / heard them talking amongst themselves and laughing while I was freaking out at the ceremony site because things were not how they were supposed to be. I literally did not speak to ANY of the event coordinators the day of the wedding, not one person, I did not even see them at ALL. But they sure found a way to contact us when it was time to get our money leading up to the wedding date. The food was so incredibly salty we couldn't even eat at our own wedding. The chicken piccata which we tasted at the wedding fair months prior was so salty a small bite of it had to be immediately followed by a drink of water every time. The carved beef was the same. We had to go check on our guests and EVERY single table had the same sentiment on the food--TOO MUCH SALT!! The ONLY decent thing worth eating was the bread rolls and the wedge-cut roasted (RED) potatoes (which were neither wedge-cut nor red). The salad had cubed ham, which was an issue because this was not in the ingredients of the menu we picked for our wedding dinner at all! Why?? BECAUSE MY WIFE IS OF MUSLIM ORIGIN AND DOES NOT EAT PORK! Thanks to Fairview crystal springs' negligence some of our guests had to go hungry.

The venue has pros and cons, but given the pros, we would still host our wedding here again if we could do it all over. However we learned a few things that can hopefully help out ...

others. Pros \+ beautiful ceremony site \+ convenient for SF, South Bay, and SFO \+ bargain prices for all inclusive things like DJ, day of coordinator, decor set up and take down, etc \+ decent food, especially people raved about chicken skewers Cons \- moved our rehearsal last minute to another date even though guests are flying in Friday \- did not set up ceremony site like they promised, and got mad at me when I asked about it that day. The day of coordinator also yelled at the videographer at some point \- didn’t open the gate for us on time when we arrived 1 hr before the ceremony \- strict start times of only 1 hr access to venue prior \- even though we paid for open bar, bartender took down the sign after cocktail hour, leaving guests confused about this. Also bartender didn’t seem to know how to mix drinks \- DJ didn’t stay on schedule for the structure of the event planned, which I guess is fine since we checked in and he convinced us to stay off schedule \- ceremony site and reception aren’t walkable. You need to get a shuttle since the ceremony site doesn’t have enough parking So if you want to go with this venue, get a friend to MC to stay on schedule as well as make announcements about open bar so people aren’t confused. Also hire your own day of coordinator. If you love just the ceremony site, hire them for the ceremony only, and find a different reception site.

say were the two we interacted with the most and they were both AMAZING. Brittany took over the dinner service and she was fantastic as well. On top of being hard pressed to find a more picturesque location for a wedding ceremony that is also relatively convenient (aka no helicopter rides or super long drives along windy roads) the service was phenomenal. If this is a place you want to get married then have no reservations about how well the staff is going to take care of you.

Please be VERY CAUTIOUS when using this venue. We had downsized our wedding from about 200 guests to 55. If it was this bad for 55 guests, I can't imagine how much worse it would h...

ave been if it'd been the previous count of 200 guests. Our wedding was memorable, but extremely stressful due to these mistakes. I e-mailed the vendor to provide them feedback after the wedding, but never received a reply. They already have our money, so I doubt they're going to respond. Here is an excerpt from my e-mail to the vendor: I am also e-mailing to provide feedback on our wedding that was held on Sunday, July 25. Our wedding was memorable, but there were some things that could have been improved. I think the change of wedding coordinator/director from Emmanoel a month prior to our wedding definitely played a role because things we had discussed with him may not have been written in our wedding notes, thus causing the confusion. 1) The welcome table at the ceremony—It just wasn’t there and caused some major confusion and delay. Guests started arriving and nothing was set up. We called the venue and NOBODY picked up. When we finally got a folding table, there were no linens for it. 2) The tables at the reception were rearranged without our knowledge. This made it difficult to seat our guests. 3) The flower color for food at the reception that was discussed, e-mailed, and printed out was not followed. The catering staff dealt with a language barrier and some of the guests received the incorrect meals, causing allergic reactions—and some guests ended up choosing not to eat (like my own parents). I didn’t even know this until days AFTER the wedding. 4) Some guests didn’t receive the kids meals that we had paid for. I’m not sure how there was an incorrect count and no back-ups. 5) The itinerary that we discussed (and changed during our last wedding meeting) was not updated for the DJ. It seems like he had an outdated itinerary. I had also met with Storm ahead of time and we discussed the changes, but they weren’t implemented. When the catering staff began serving food right in the middle of the best man’s speech, we found that extremely rude. I understand that the food needed to be served, but food should have been ready before the speeches, or served in between speeches. I’m not sure if it was due to the DJ having an outdated itinerary or the kitchen having a food delay/not knowing the schedule. (The DJ was also falling asleep!) 6) Because the itinerary wasn’t followed, some guests had to leave early. We still had guests mingling with us, but tables were already being cleared as early as 10PM! We paid for the venue until 11PM. Some of my guests’ items were moved as well without their permission during this early clean-up. (They were signing our guest book away from their table.) Our sweetheart table was cleared and we didn’t even get to take our champagne flutes. 7) I had no idea who our contact person for the day was. I think things would have run much better if we knew who was in charge ahead of time or knew who the contact person was for the different parts of the day. I didn’t see any of the wedding coordinators that we had met prior to our wedding. It wasn’t communicated at we would be on our own. Our wedding was 2.5 years in the planning and we knew there would be some hiccups along the way. We didn’t expect these major hiccups.

My husband and I got married here last weekend and can't speak highly enough of Fairview Crystal Springs and the staff! We booked with them early on when we got engaged in 2019 and...

had to postpone our wedding due to COVID last summer. Fairview let us move dates without any penalties which was very much appreciated. They followed all CDC guidelines to keep their guests safe as well. One of the main reasons we picked Fairview (other than the stunning ceremony site and modern, classy reception area), was the convenience of booking with them. They are a great venue for a busy couple because they have many vendors that they contract with regularly. With the elite package, our cake, floral, DJ, invitations, food and open bar were all included in our cost. It made for a stress-free wedding because the vendors are so used to working with Fairview. Not to mention the food, alcohol, dessert, etc were all wonderful. We also can't speak highly enough of Angelique! She was our wonderful wedding coordinator who answered all of our questions and helped us create our dream wedding.

last location we looked over. I was very impressed the moment we did our first consultation not just because of the view but because how comfortable it was. From then on everything went smooth, from choosing the menu, any questions i had were answered less than 24 hours. The set up with the florist and DJ and the bakery everything was all scheduled and timed very well. They listened to how we wanted our reception hall to look like. Also they renovated the banquet hall!!! My husband went to a wedding 7 years ago and compared to the present, he said it looked more spacious and inviting and new. I would highly recommend this venue to my friends and family for functions. I never felt stressed from them. Soren, Immanuel and all their staff did an incredible job thank you again!!!!

n tons of issues day of our wedding. We spent so much time going over details and our timeline with their staff but it all unfortunately went out the door come our big day. A huge factory we believe is the venue’s choice to book another wedding before ours in the morning. The staff is not capable to do two weddings on the same day successfully. Our family friends saved the day when they stepped in and setup most of the reception properly as the staff was setting things incorrectly and way behind schedule! Lastly, the DJ really let us down in multiple ways and if the venue allowed, we would have not used him. When you fall in love with their ceremony site like we did, I urge any future bride to not rely on the venue to coordinate details to their required vendors and execute day of- and instead hire your own wedding planner.

The staff went above and beyond to make sure that our guest and my husband and I were happy satisfied throughout the night. The food that they provided us was wonderful and tasted really good. If you're looking to have a wedding or reception I would definitely recommend this place because the staff is wonderful and the food is great.

On our wedding day, it seemed like there were 10 Amanoels! Everywhere we turned, he was there, smiling and ready to help. My family and friends were amazed by his professionalism. He had an answer for everything. Everyone kept telling me that nothing goes perfectly at weddings. So, I was prepared for imperfections and mistakes. Well, the Fairview team proved me and everyone else wrong. I am happy to say that our wedding was nothing but perfect. The vendors they recommend are fantastic (all of them). I can't thank the Fairview team enough for making my wedding dream a reality.

She edited our package plan multiple times to make sure things would be exactly as we wanted. We brought our own centerpieces for the tables and worked in coordination with their provided florist. My jaw dropped when I entered the reception space; it was exactly what I had dreamed of! Communication was a bit fuzzy at times, but I found that being persistent was key. All the staff we worked with were very helpful though when questions did arise. I felt that my day was focused on us as we began our new life together and even the small hiccups were addressed as quickly as they possible could've been. Thank you Crystal Springs!

y if she did respond right away. The reception venue recently underwent a beautiful renovation. Everything looked stunning and would work with just about any color pallet. I will say, on the outside/parking lot the reception venue does not look like much, but the inside really is beautiful. You also cannot beat that amazing ceremony space. The gazebo overlooking the reservoir and hills is breathtaking. We didn't do too much for our decorations, since the room didn't need it. We used their table number stands & round mirrors for the table. I supplied the actual table numbers & our florists did a clear, cylinder vase with orange & white flowers. They had a number linen options, but we did ivory with alternating black & orange napkins (which made the tables pop). We did upgrade the linens for our sweetheart table (black sequins) & our cake table (orange hued). They supplied easels for our sign at the ceremony site & our seating chart at the reception site. We chose the buffet style, which we think was the way to go for our number of guests (about 110). Everyone said the food was delicious. They brought a little bit of everything to the sweetheart table for my husband & I to enjoy. We also got a bit of some of our cocktail hour appetizers in a private room after we did our photos but before our entrance, which we appreciated. I loved how everything was a "one stop shop" kind of thing. We got a voucher for our invitations for Basic Invite, which was great. We also used their cakery, Mazzetti's which was amazing. The cake the cake came out delicious and exactly how we wanted it. A number of guests admitted they went for 2nds (and some 3rds). We also used their DJ, Shawn Storm. HE IS AMAZING!! I cannot express how great he is. He has a form on his site that makes planning music for all parts of the day super easy. Plus, he is great on the mic, super responsive, and is just a gem to work with. And for items that were part of our package that we did not want (florist), they deduct it from the cost. You can really customize what you want, which I loved! Few minor complaints. 1st we thought we would have someone checking on us when we finally sat down to eat. We had to stop someone to get a drink, they got the drink but then didn't return. I would recommend asking a friend/family to keep tabs on you to make sure you get water & drinks. 2nd, we heard from a number of guests that the bartender was not super friendly. I think this was partly because she was by herself for a group of 110 people, most of whom were drinking. She was just trying to keep the line moving, a 2nd bartender would have been a good idea. Our final complaint came at the end of the night/next day. We talked to the banquet captain about getting the leftovers of food & cake, as we were told that they usually pack some up for the bride and groom. She said it was ok to pick it up the next day. When my husband went back the next day, there were no leftovers for us. In the rush of the night, we only got the 2 bites of cake, so we were looking forward to leftovers. Again, these complaints are minor, considering what could have gone wrong. We highly recommend this venue & Selina! The venue is stunning. They have some amazing vendors. They made our day stress free & we are beyond thankful.

SUMMARY: Spectacular view; looks just like the pictures. Everything else was terrible. Someone needs to take this view away from them. We had a ceremony only at the Fairview Crysta...

l Springs. Here is our story: BEFORE THE REHEARSAL: Every single time we contacted or met with the Fairview, we met with a different person. There was no continuity, and it felt like we had to start over every time we talked to them. They also never answer their phones. ON THE DAY OF THE REHEARSAL: [Minor complaint: If you do a ceremony-only on a Saturday, they force you to do the rehearsal the previous Thursday.] When we arrived, the gates to the ceremony site were locked, and they would not answer their phones. The rehearsal eventually started 30 minutes late, and only after they dragged their feet and made me wait for no apparent reason in their main office. Once the rehearsal did begin, the Fairview staff member barked orders at my bridal party without in any way asking what me or my husband wanted for our ceremony. I had to re-choreograph the ceremony with my bridal party later on. It was all very late, unprofessional, and uncommunicative. It was very clear that the Fairview Crystal Springs did not care about me or my husband, or our vision for the wedding. ON THE WEDDING DAY: When we arrived at the ceremony site to set up, no one from the Fairview was there to meet us, and none of the tables/ equipment/etc were set out. They did manage to put out the ceremony chairs for guests, but TWICE AS MANY as we asked for. The groomsmen (NOT THE FAIRVIEW) had to quickly put away the extra 80 chairs as guests were arriving. During this time, the Fairview wasn’t answering their phone (p.s. they never did any time I called them in the past year). Eventually we sent the officiant to get them to come down ten minutes before guests were supposed to arrive.

We were initially drawn to the gorgeous setting and the fact that the venue was sort of a one stop shop because they include so much in the package but with the option to pick and ...

choose to customise everything based on your preferences. We put our deposit down the same day, even though this was before the remodel that was done, in good faith that they were going to do a great job which they certainly did! Since our wedding was scheduled for only two months after the remodel we were told that some of the final details like the up lights and window dressings wouldn't be completed by then but they actually made it happen so again, we were extremely lucky! After putting down the deposit, the original coordinators we were assigned to suddenly wouldn't reply to our emails/calls for days so we were a bit concerned but they were very helpful when they did finally reply. This went on for several months and one day we found out that they were no longer working there and we were assigned a new coordinator, Francesca. Again we were a bit concerned at the change and the fact that we weren't warned at all but once we started working with Francesca, we were so happy Fairview made the staff upgrade along with the renovation. We felt very lucky to have been with Fairview after that transition happened. We only kept the florist (Rosedale Flowers, Avonne is wonderful!) from all the vendors they offered in the package...we would have used the DJ but he was terrible at the time we were booking and by the time they got the really good new one we already booked ours but wished we didn't. Francesca was so patient, responsive, and accommodating with all of our requests that the more we worked with her the more lucky we felt to have had her as our new coordinator. Amo and the other girls there (Selena and Simone) we also all terrific and we just couldn't have been happier with their help. We gave the staff what we thought was a tall order on some of our decorations and they set everything up perfectly. The buffet turned out to be a really great option and everyone said the food was really good (We didn't actually get to try the food because we were too busy enjoying all the festivities even though we were warned to eat and Francesca offered to bring food besides the appetizers they had for us at the bridal sweet which, by the way, was also a great bonus to the venue). We even requested a Chilean sea bass that isn't usually one of the menu options but the chef did an excellent job preparing it and the prime rib station was also a great hit and very delicious (we did get to try that at the bridal fair!). Besides the endless email exchanges with Francesca, she and Amo were so attentive and helpful during the whole wedding we really couldn't be more grateful! We had 10 people per 60inch round table and it didn't seem crowded though that's the max you should put. Decide how many tables you'll have before drafting a seating chart and ask for an exact layout based n that number of tables prior to selecting the seats. We didn't do that and it was really time consuming going back and forth a bunch before we finally asked for the layout. The cocktail area could use some heating (our wedding was late April) Overall we'd definitely recommend Fairview for your wedding! But consider the size of the reception area if you're having more than 150 guest. We had 145 and it felt like more would be too much, especially if you're doing buffet style.

very bad. I have called the office number so many times all throughout the planning and all the time or should I say EVERY TIME all I get is the answering machine Leaving me with no choice but to leave a voicemail although I need answers right away. BUT even though voicemails are left I don't get a call back until a day after. E-mails are not answered right away. don't you think you need a front office person? Meeting 3 different person throughout the planning was also bizarre. I can't remember all their names but it sounded like they were all the director of this site. 3 days before the wedding. I have to contact the event planner. I am not sure if "the whole team" even looked at the weather that week. The weather already said thunderstorms on the day of the wedding. But not even one of this "directors" contacted us about plan B.

She made me so happy and comfortable from beginning to end. I didn’t have to worry about anything and our day went off without any issues. All the other vendors were amazing as well! Everyone said our flowers were gorgeous. Niko, the DJ from Ace entertainment, made our night. He got everyone on the dance floor. Overall, we had a relaxed, fun, beautiful and amazing wedding day!

I am happy to give my highest recommendation to Fairview Crystal Springs as a wedding venue, and my highest praise for AnneMarie, their director of weddings and events. Together, t...

hey make a fabulous combination! We booked Crystal Springs in mid-June (2017), and our wedding took place less than 3 months later on Labor Day weekend! We had 80 guests and had our ceremony at the Crystal Springs gazebo and the reception at their golf course clubhouse. We liked the various packages offered by Crystal Springs, and opted for the "Eternal" package, but we were able to customize it. AnneMarie and the venue were extremely flexible and accommodating in working with us and our budget. Our wedding went off without a hitch. The ceremony location is amazing and to be honest, it was priceless. We were lucky enough to have great weather and our guests raved about the views. For nature lovers, if you want an outside ceremony with nature as your backdrop, this certainly fits the bill, allowing you to feel like you're in a magical area far from the city--while still being conveniently located. The venue also offers the reception venue as a back-up ceremony venue, which we fortunately did not need. The only tricky thing is that the ceremony and reception sites are about 1 mile apart, it's not walkable, and you wouldn't call Lyft/Uber for a mile drop-off, so we had to ask guests to carpool. It worked out fine. The staff was extremely friendly and everyone did a great job at making our guests feel comfortable. A few guests did not RSVP their vegetarian preference, but the kitchen was able to accommodate them after all. A completely professional and responsive team. You don't absolutely need a separate coordinator if you have a reasonably simple wedding with a simple program for the reception, because AnneMarie and her team were so great and responsive in terms of planning, and they're very hands-on for the ceremony. However, if you have a lot going on for the reception, then you might want to consider having a day-of coordinator to help you out (and/or a coordinator to help with the planning, as it's still a lot of work). For sake of a comprehensive review, I will say that the only weaknesses are that the reception decor is a tiny bit dated and and could probably use some refurbishment. Also, the food that you get is perfectly adequate and they accommodated a variety of diets, but if you're a "foodie", then the menu might not be to your taste. Finally, the women's locker room is the private area where the bride and bridal party can get ready. We actually got ready at a hotel and I simply put my dress on in the locker room. It's not one of those photogenic bridal rooms. And that's fine, because that's not what I prioritized. What most of us learn in the process of planning a wedding is that we have to prioritize and make trade-offs. Crystal Springs more than satisfied my priorities and exceeded my expectations. Overall, I would say that the strengths of Fairview Crystal Springs are the ceremony location, AnneMarie and her team, and the flexibility and convenience of their custom packages that accommodate a variety of budgets and can save you considerable time and stress in planning. Together, this enabled us to plan our wedding in less than 3 months, within budget, and we and our guests were delighted. I could not recommend them enough.

me set backs. First off the DJ... I literally tried to contact ACE Entertainment MULTIPLE TIMES before the wedding. In which Rob never responded to me. It got down to the wedding day and I still did not hear from him. I asked our wonderful event coordinator (AnneMarie) and she said she would take care of it. Brings me to 20 minutes before I walked down the isle... my dad comes running into the bridal room telling me the DJ was there and he didn't have any of our paperwork!!!! I had to find my phone and emAil to him as soon as I could. I really don't even know if he worked for ACE Entertainment but it seemed like he got thrown into it last minute. The ceremony went fine. But then the wedding party introduction started. First off he pronounced every single persons name wrong and THEN didn't even introduce us with the correct name. It was so embarrassing. I didn't pay 30K to not even have my name pronounced correctly. He played awesome music during our cocktail hour. But then played NOTHING on my song request form for the dancing. The food overall was very good. But the service was horrible. My family had to ask multiple times for plates of food that were missing from the table. I felt like there was a lot of sitting around waiting with no direction. They cut they cake and then DIDNT EVEN ANNOUCE the cake was on a table in the bar area. So about half of our wedding guest never got cake. I think our event coordinator was wonderful. But for 30K I think a lot of stuff was done messy. And made it stressful on th day of the event.

We just got married at Wedgewood Crystal Springs last weekend and I can honestly say it was really a wedding of my dream. Everything went so smooth. The whole Wedgewood team was AM...

AZING. We booked the venue a year and a half in advance just to make sure we secure a day in April for a lower rate and good weather. From the beginning of the whole planning process, we have worked with different people and all of them were so nice. Emails was answered within 2-3 hours, sometime just a few minutes. They answered all my questions throughly. The few last days, Elise was helping us and we couldn't be happier with her. She's just soo sweet and caring. She got everything together and set up every little details of our reception. We love her ! The Ceremony Site: At first I thought that I would skip the ceremony here because I already have church ceremony, and boy I'm SOOO glad I did NOT skip. It was so nice. All my guests love the view so much. I was worries that it would rain, but I was so happy that the weather couldn't be more perfect. It was in the mid 70s with minimal wind. So perfect. The DJ: Robert couldn't do my wedding so he send Roy. Both of them are so friendly and easy to work with. Roy was really nice and he checked in with me often to make sure everything is good the way it is. The Cake: It was smaller than I thought because I love their Derby flavor but they don't make it into the layer cake. So I ended up having a big Derby Sheet Cake in the back, which make our display cake smaller than I thought. Our mistake. But the cake was good. The Food: I didn't get to taste the appetizers, but I heard people said appetizers was good, especially the bacon wrap scallops. I am a little disappointed with the steak though. We have plated dinner with Filet Mignon and Salmon. The Salmon and garlic Mash Potato was good, but they need to improve on the steak. It was so chewy. It doesn't taste like Filet Mignon at all. We booked the food without a tasting. It wasn't our top priority so the food doesn't ruin our day. Flower: Avonne was our Florist. We had a meeting with her and went over the details. She's good, but I feel like she doesn't listen a lot. She tends to go her way most of the time. The flower comes out ok... I'm just too happy to care about it, but honestly if I can go back, I would bring in my own florist for this, I found a cheaper rate for upgrade flower. Avonne charge me $95 to upgrade from the small vase to big vase. It was quite expensive. Again flower wasn't a big deal for me. The Bar: One of the best thing about my wedding day was the Open Bar. I added 4 extra hours of open bar for my guests and it was soooo worth it. Everyone had a tons of fun. I made a special cocktails menu for my wedding and it was such a hit. The bartenders was chill and they have no problem pouring 15 shots at a time for my guests. Alcohol was the key to a fun wedding. Over all. I highly recommended Wedgewood to all the brides who want minimal amount of stress for their wedding.

d heard lots of good things about it. It was Jun 15th, 2015 when my fiancé and I found ourselves standing in front of Wedgewood Crystal Springs. We had originally developed a spreadsheet with a list of 25 venues on geographic locations around the bay that’s most convenient for us and our guests, this huge list consist of what type of packages the venues offer, what they don’t offer, and pricing. After booking our very first venue appointment with Wedgewood Burlingame and sitting down with our wonderful Wedding Coordinator Megan, we said yes to the venue and got rid of the list. As product launch coordinator in the day and a self-proclaimed unofficial wedding planner at night, I was very surprised and impressed with the solid structure, detailed oriented and execution efficiency Megan provided to us during the short 8 months of planning. Here’s my list of top 3 thumbs up on what we loved about Megan and her team- 1\. Detailed: Provided Beginning to End process verbally and written 2\. Flexibility: Able and willing to work out meeting times, package alterations 3\. Professionalism: Courteous, efficient, effective and objective Megan and team showed a tremendous amount of dedication and support, not to mention mental certainly and reassurance. Huge shout out to DJ Rob for meeting with us and going over the timeline and our music sheet. He did an exceptional job from music for the ceremony, making announcements and the reception. My overall experience? I had high expectations and they’re normally hard to meet, Wedgewood and team gave us that confidence and we can say that the process and experience was unforgettable.

Parking is more than ample and the Burlingame location was convenient for our Bay Area guests and out of town guests staying in San Francisco. Wedgewood includes many vendors in the price which is both economical & convenient. Searching for a florist, baker, DJ, officiant (extra fee) would have been a lot more work. Also, you don't have to pay each vendor separately on the day. We had a fantastic day & are so pleased we chose Wedgewood Crystal Springs over our 2nd choice hotel in Palo Alto (which was 25-30% more expensive)

o give us all the relevant information, let us ask plenty of questions, and answer all the questions we thought of later. Each meeting was well coordinated and everything detailed out. It was very simple to add and remove things from their pre-defined wedding packages. The only issue leading up to the wedding was some of the notices arrived after things were due, but this could have been due to the fact that we moved up our wedding by two weeks due to a conflict. The day of the wedding, we had some friends bring the flowers and decorations from the church to the ceremony and everything worked out well. We wanted to take some sunset pictures at the ceremony site and no one was there to open the gate as discussed, but eventually someone did show up and we didn't miss the sunset, so no harm, no foul. When we arrived, the bridal party was immediately given appetizers and drinks. Megan made sure that we had everything we needed without ever having to ask. The food was amazing (I wanted to sample it all - too bad we couldn't take home leftovers, but I guess liability issues are a problem). They accommodated some special presentation requests from our family members without any issues. Overall we had an amazing night and everything turned out spectacularly. We would definitely recommend Wedgewood Crystal Springs to others looking for a reception location (their packages made everything so much easier)!

Highly recommend for any couples with full-time jobs. Wedgewood puts together convenient packages with a florist, dj, ceremony/reception location, etc. to take a lot of the stress ...

off of you. All the vendors did an amazing job, and the reception site was beautiful. Thanks!

I definitely recommend the Wedgewood Banquet Center at Crystal Springs. While there are a few things I wasn't so happy with, ultimately, this place takes care of so many details f...

or you and it's GORGEOUS!! I can't even count the number of people that have told us our wedding was the most beautiful wedding they've ever been to! With the beautiful gazebo overlooking the crystal springs reservoir, this ceremony location is amazing. In terms of planning, they take care of all the details and you can customize as little or as much as you want. They have vendors for everything, which made the process much simpler, which was great for me! The only things I was not happy with were fairly minor. On the day of the wedding, they had a morning wedding that ran late which meant the staff had less time to set up the decor I brought in. I spent a lot of time on it, so I was pretty disappointed that some of my items didn't make it out. I also didn't get a few smaller items back, some of my candles and our Mr and Mrs Whiskey glasses that we'd brought in for photo's could not be found when we went to pick up our stuff the next day :( Ultimately, if I had to do it over again, I'd still pick Wedgewood. The day was amazing and beautiful and the value was great!

It took me a while to make a decision despite my 1 month of wedding planning. I have been in touch with the ladies of Wedgewood so much that everytime I have question, I email them...

and they respond so quickly even on a weekend. They made my day go by smoothly. It makes the planning easier because of it being inclusive. Thank you!

This was an amazing location, I couldn't have asked for more. There is a gazebo less than a mile down from the golf course where the ceremony takes place overlooking a reservoir, ...

just gorgeous! You can get packages from bare bones, to everything including the cake vendor, dj, food & flowers which we elected to do. You can also add in photography and Photo Booth among other add ons; but I had my own photographer, and photobooth was expensive, so we went with a groupon deal. I think it definitely saves money in the long run, and is easier because all of the vendors are very familiar with the venue. Dealing with the staff was great; they always answered questions in a timely fashion and were so helpful.
