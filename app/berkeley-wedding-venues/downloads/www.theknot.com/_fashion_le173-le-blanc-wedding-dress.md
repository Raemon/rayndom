Description

Bold and breathtaking, LE173 Mona is a Mikado ball gown designed for the bride who commands every room she enters. A straight-across neckline and wide tank straps frame the shoulders, while the ruched bodice flows seamlessly into a defined Basque waistline that sculpts the torso with refined precision. Crafted from shimmering satin, the silhouette catches the light beautifully, and a trail of covered buttons cascades down the cathedral-length train for a timeless bridal finish. For a couture-worthy statement, the oversized detachable bow (BOW006) transforms the gown into a regal masterpiece with sweeping royal flair. Glamorous, unforgettable, and distinctly modern, Mona is made for the bride who dares to stand out.
