**Size range:** 4–14

## What to Look for in Autumn Mother-of-the-Bride Dresses

Keep reading for our expert advice on all things fall 2025 mother-of-the-bride dresses. From the trendiest colors and fabrics to to the season's most popular styles, we've got you covered.

### Jewel Tones and Rich Hues

When it comes to fall colors for mother-of-the-bride dresses, the season shifts from summer's bright and light shades to autumn's dark and rich hues. We start to see deep jewel tones (think: sapphire blue, emerald green, citrine yellow and amethyst purple) and wine-inspired colors, like burgundy, merlot and cabernet. You also can't go wrong with versatile dark shades, including black, navy and green, which are not only great for autumn but can also be worn year-round.

### Velvet, Satin, Lace and Beading

As temperatures get cooler, fabrics for mother-of-the-bride dresses become thicker. We love the look of sultry velvet gowns, but you can't go wrong with romantic lace, silky-smooth satin or luxe crepe. If the wedding date lands closer to the end of summertime, like in September or early October, look for lightweight fabrics with moisture-wicking properties, like cotton or silk. Additionally, fabrics with embroidery or embellishments, such as floral appliqués, glittery sequins and fringe, are great ways to achieve a glamorous fall look.

### Longer Sleeves & Skirts

For fall MOB attire, expect to see longer hemlines and sleeves. Fall mother-of-the-bride dresses with long sleeves, three-quarter sleeves and flutter sleeves are great options, but strapless and sleeveless styles aren't completely out of the question. (Plus, you could always pair a sleeveless silhouette with a shawl to stay warm.) Depending on the [wedding dress code](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-guest-attire-cheat-sheet), venue and climate, you might be able to wear a midi or a knee-length dress. If the fall wedding you're attending requires [black-tie](https://www.theknot.com/content/what-to-wear-black-tie) or [formal attire](https://www.theknot.com/content/formal-wedding-attire), look for gowns with more coverage, longer hems and formal fabrics. On the other hand, cocktail, semi-formal and [casual weddings](https://www.theknot.com/content/what-to-wear-casual) tend to have more flexibility regarding skirt length and styles.
