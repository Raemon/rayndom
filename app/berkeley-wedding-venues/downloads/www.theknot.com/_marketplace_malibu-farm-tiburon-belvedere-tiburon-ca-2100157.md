Review of Malibu Farm, Tiburon Malibu Farm in Tiburon is a beautiful spot located right on the bay — you can’t miss it as the ferry approaches. The setting is stunning, with two levels of seating: upstairs offers a magnificent panoramic view o...

f the water, while downstairs still provides a lovely atmosphere close to the action. The food was excellent. We started with oysters served four different ways — all fresh and delicious — followed by a baby gem salad that was easily one of the best we’ve had. The service from our waiter was attentive and friendly, and he made sure everything was perfect throughout the meal. Unfortunately, the experience was marred by the hostess. Despite several empty tables, she refused to seat us upstairs, citing potential future reservations. Downstairs, we were placed at a table directly in the sun, and when we asked to move it just a couple of feet for comfort — without inconveniencing anyone — she flatly refused. This could have easily been a five-star experience, but the hostess’s attitude really detracted from what would otherwise have been an outstanding visit. That said, the food and location are so good that I still recommend visiting Malibu Farm — just hope for a better hostess when you go. ⸻ Would you like me to make it sound a bit funnier or more casual (like something you’d post on Yelp or Google Reviews), or keep this balanced and polished tone?no

This place was so peaceful. It was a weekday and we didn’t try to make a reservation. Servers were kind and served fast. We tried 2 pizzas, 3 sides and 2 desserts. We liked all of them.

The view sitting outside is amazing and beautiful if it's not foggy. Which we were lucky for that when I came to visit here on a Sunday. We made a reservation not sure how busy they would be for 1230pm brunch/lunch. They we busy and had an ongo...

ing of people coming and going while we were there. The food was delicious and definitely would love to come to try there other dishes. The parking is difficult to find close to the restaurant. Worth the walk down the alley of small businesses on the way. The service was really good.

Beautiful space with fresh, healthy food We stopped by for a light meal and enjoyed a salad, some oysters, and their version of a Coke — which was a tamarind-flavored, healthier take. Everything tasted fresh and light, perfect if you’re looking...

for a clean, feel-good meal. The highlight was definitely the ambiance. The space is stunning, and I highly recommend making a reservation if you want to snag a table with a view of the water. Food-wise, I’d give it a solid 3/5 — fresh and well-presented, but not particularly memorable. Still worth visiting for the setting alone.

Only go here for the view. It is beautiful and that is really the only highlight. The food is below average and definitely not worth the price. Service was just okay, nothing special. What really bothered me was the way the manager treated gues...

t as there was a clear difference in how brown vs. white customers were treated, which was disappointing and uncomfortable. The view is great, but overall not a food experience I would recommend.
