Hey there—I'm excited you’re considering me as your wedding photographer. About me: My name is Prasanna, and I love photography. I’ve been photographing couples for nearly 7 years and landscapes for over 10. In 2023, after losing my day job, I launched my own full-time photography business. I love being out in nature, photographing its beauty, and I’m here to help you connect your special moment with the nature that surrounds us. I’m a dog lover & live with my husband in San Francisco. Why choose me? 3 years ago I had my cozy wedding with just our nearest and dearest (under 30). It was a beautiful day—but I didn’t put much thought into my photographer. The essence of our day wasn’t fully captured: portraits after the ceremony, family photos, and the details from our well-planned décor. I have some photos, but not as many as I hoped for. That experience shaped my promise to you: no couple should feel that way. On your wedding day, I go above and beyond—capturing candid moments, posed portraits, the ceremony, the reception, and those unseen, in-between memories that often get missed. I’ll also document the details you worked hard to plan: decorations, florals, and your reception space. I’ll capture the subtle smiles, silly laughs, quiet tears, heartfelt embraces, and stolen glances you might not notice in the moment but will want to remember. My goal is to create natural, candid, timeless images that truly reflect you and your love story. With me, you don’t have to stress about how your photos will turn out. Photography with me goes beyond the lens—it’s a heartfelt, refined experience where every moment is cared for, and you feel at ease and truly valued. My focus is presence, ambiance, and care—the kind of service that makes sure your most important memories are captured with beauty and intention. Location, style, and gear: I work anywhere in San Francisco, California, USA, and worldwide. My style is clean, crisp, and true to life, preserving natural earth colors and tones for a vibrant look. I offer a free pre-wedding/engagement session with my highest package, and a well-discounted engagement session even if you book my lowest package. I photograph with the latest and fastest cameras and lenses. I use two Sony mirrorless cameras, each with dual SD card slots—so while I’m working at your wedding, your photos are already backed up. I use prime and telephoto lenses, natural light, and artistic composition to create dreamy, whimsical, candid photographs with a bright, clean, crisp, natural look. Most people describe me as calm, easygoing, fun, friendly, professional, organized. I provide sneak peeks within 7 days and your full gallery within 5–8 weeks (possibly sooner, depending on schedules). I respond to emails quickly, and if you’d like to chat right away, give me a call. Based in San Francisco, CA, Prasanna Pilaka Photography offers professional services for weddings and special events.

Working with Prasanna was such a pleasure! She took plenty of beautiful shots of me and my fiancee, and I really appreciated how communicative she was about scheduling. Even when w...

e had to reschedule, she didn't charge me a single extra dime, which was such a lovely surprise. I would definitely recommend her.
