Jacqueline was the consummate professional on my wedding day and I could not be more thankful for her services. She made the day go smoothly, handled all of our vendors with ease, ...

and did so much for us outside of her contracted duties throughout the night - to the point of even offering to clean up the bridal suite and help my mother with her bags (not necessary at all!). I'm so grateful to have found Jacqueline and would recommend Hudson Ave Events to any bride planning a wedding. I want her to help plan every special event in my life in the future!

We are so happy we chose Jacqueline as our partial wedding planner for our June 2024 wedding at Ruth Bancroft Gardens in Walnut Creek. Since she's based in Walnut Creek and has don...

e many weddings there, she knows all the ins and outs of the garden and has great connections with local vendors. Her knowledge, responsiveness, and fantastic suggestions made a huge difference whenever we needed help. We started with a phone call to discuss our wedding vision and get to know each other. About six months before the wedding, we did a walkthrough of the venue together. Jacqueline was always there to promptly answer our questions through email, and she even joined us on our trip to Chairs for Affairs (rentals) to help pick out linens, tables, decorations, bar stands, and more. We saw her again at our rehearsal dinner, where her direction made everything run smoothly. The day before the wedding, she graciously helped print and frame all our signs. On the day of our wedding, everything went off without a hitch, thanks to Jacqueline's help with the schedule. She even made sure we ate! The day was a fun blur, and we were so grateful to have her there. Wedding planning can be stressful, even for those who enjoy it. Jacqueline made the process so much easier and put us at ease. If you're looking for a wedding planner in the Bay Area, we highly recommend Jacqueline. She offers month of coordination, along with partial and full-service wedding planning. She will make sure your day goes smoothly and worry-free.

Jacqueline from Hudson Ave. Events did an amazing job with our day of coordination! The day of our wedding, we truly did not have to think about anything—Jacqueline was so organize...

d and on top of EVERYTHING. We even had a mini moment of chaos when I got a call from our caterer that there was some kind of mess up on their side, and Jacqueline sorted it all out for us within minutes of letting her know. I can't imagine how stressful it would have been if she hadn't been there. Also, she did an amazing job setting up the whole venue—she arranged all the decor so beautifully, and also made sure that everything was in its place (from the music, to the snacks and vendors, to all the random games and other activities we brought). Every single activity was already set up without us having to think about it at all. Also, Jacqueline was super proactive about cleaning up after the night, and made our job so easy! My partner and I had planned to help clean up, but we were still sending off some of our guests at the end of the evening. Jacqueline worked with the venue staff to clean up everything and make sure everything was all packed up for us to take home. It was so easy, I didn't even know what was happening! I'm so grateful to have worked with Jacqueline and Hudson Ave. Events for our wedding, and would definitely recommend them to anyone who is planning their upcoming wedding!

ted with J for month-of coordination and are so glad we did. She was flexible, responsive, and detailed. She brought our vision to life and more, and the whole event went without a hitch ever coming to my attention. She assisted us in receiving and storing decorations prior to the event, as we were a whole 50 states away. And she even fulfilled our wish of having in-n-out as a late night snack - went out and picked it up for our whole party. We’re having a formal ceremony with family in NC and only wish she could be here to do it all over again. Have nothing but good things to say about Jacqueline and Hudson Avenue Events! 💕🥳🪄

rch. I only had one minor freakout (about leaving a card at home) and she helped me calm down. I am the type of person to want to know everything and be in control, but I had no doubts turning everything over to Jackie. We still have our large reception planned for March 2022 and I'm sure she'll continue to do a great job! Thanks again for all your help and support! ------- We used Hudson Ave events for their month-of wedding coordinator services. We first spoke with Jacqueline over the phone and liked her confidence and past experience, as well as being slightly familiar with our venue. We then met with her in person, where she gave us a binder to keep all our contracts and put in our wedding inspo. She went with us to our venue to sketch out the layout and fine tune our wedding timeline. Although our wedding was postponed due to COVID-19, she checked up on us and offered any help she could to contact vendors or guests. Both my fiance and I are "helper" types who would probably set up our own wedding and stay for clean up, but Jacqueline assured us that she wants our day to be as relaxed and hands-off for us as possible. I can't wait to see her in action for our new wedding date!
