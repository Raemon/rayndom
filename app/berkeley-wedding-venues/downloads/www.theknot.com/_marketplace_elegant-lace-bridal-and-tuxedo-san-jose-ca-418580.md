ured out what kind of shape, fabric, and design was best for me. Even when my entourage didn’t always align with my choices, Yvonia kept reminding me to stick with what I love. Highly recommend elegant lace!

Wow! Elegant Lace made wedding dress shopping fun- I felt like I was in great hands with Synthia! Not only did Synthia ask me more about the stlye I was hoping to achieve, she also...

gave really thoughtful input as to fabrics, custom orders that could be made on dresses (i.e - detachable sleeves or sleeves for longer arms). I really appreciated that she already had some dresses in mind but also let me walk around the showroom with her so if I saw something in my budget that caught my eye, I could try that on as well! Wonderful, professional, easy team to work with. My dress and veil were an absolute dream. Elegant Lace is the way to go for south bay brides. Thank you, Synthia!!!!

I'm so glad i decided to go back after my first appointment. i did not say yes during that appointment because i wanted to go out and look and try on other dress just to see how i ...

feel and the fact that i had another appointment at another store and paid a fee to book. my appointment was on a Friday. all day Saturday, I was thinking about the dress i ALMOST said yes to. i decided that night, i HAD to go back on Sunday. it was meant to be. Susana was my consultant Friday. i went in Sunday, hoping to schedule an appointment for maybe another day to try on my almost yes dress and more just in case. I got an appointment 30 min later with Susana. Susana remembered what i wanted, brought out my almost yes dress and a few others. She brought a dress i did not try on at my Friday appointment. i saw it, and i KNEW i HAD to try it on. Sure enough, i was like 98% sure that dress was the one. Susana didn't say anything except to try on my almost yes dress again, see how i feel. I said Yes to the new dress. I'm soooo glad i went back. Ill forever be grateful for Susana and everyone at elegant. Definitely recommend stop at Elegant Lace if you're shopping around for your wedding dress. :)

This place is so disorganized. I called to make an appointment to do one last try on of the dress I had thought I wanted to decide on. When making the appointment, I gave them th...

e style number and they said they would have it pulled for my appointment, no problem. Fast forward 2 weeks, my best friend drives down from San Francisco, we both take off work, I got a manicure the day before, did hair and make up just to get the best image of what it would look like on my wedding day. We show up, they can’t find the dress. Turns out they sold the sample. No problem that they sold the sample to a bride who was getting married ASAP, but how do you not call me, the bride who made an appointment specifically for this dress, to tell me you no longer have it for me to try on??? How do they not review their appointments for the day to catch that even for a phone call to me day of?? The representative wasn’t very nice about it, didn’t provide information on if they will get another sample in. Very disappointed in how this was handled, all it took was simple phone call to me to let me know they don’t have the dress anymore and I would have made other arrangements and wouldn’t be writing this review.

ction was really extensive. I had Brenda as my consultant and she was very knowledgeable (and found my perfect dress!). I also liked that before the appt, I could go around and select some dresses to start with! I came here both alone and with my bridal party and both times it was a great experience. I felt very listened to, and all her selections were really responding to what I was looking for (so no wasting time pulling or trying on dresses that I didn't like!). I am VERY happy I went with elegant lace for my dress. It was an easy, enjoyable experience and I couldn't be happier with the result. I wish they had in-house alterations but am happy to use the seamstresses they've highly recommended. Overall, I'd recommend them to all my friends who are getting married.

So luckily for my wedding dress they were great, unfortunately my bridesmaids and groomsmen did not have the same experience as I did. An older and more experienced lady helped me ...

with my wedding dress, which may have been the difference because all my bridesmaids were fitted by one of the younger staff members and they all got fitted wrong. They all but one of five bridesmaids were fitted two sizes too big, yes TWO!! If that wasn't enough they ordered one of my bridesmaids top wrong!! They all were suppose to wear a tank top and skirt and they ordered a tube top for one of them. They said that they couldn't do anything about it!! All they did was give me straps for her to pay for them to sew them on. This place is ridiculous!! Caused me so much stress! That was just the bridesmaids for the groomsmen they sized them too small. All of them including the groom had to go back and get new shirts, vest, and jackets. They didn't have the grooms stuff ready till the day before the wedding at 11:30 am, and it was a destination wedding so we were late to rehearsal. Yeah they give the bridesmaids and groomsmen 10% off if you get your wedding dress there but it is not worth all the stress they caused!!

Elegant Lace is a great place to get your wedding dress. They have a pretty large selection of dresses, varying styles and designers. It is good to go with some help (MOH, bridal...

party, etc.) because initially you go around the racks and pick dresses you want to try. I worked with Haley as my consultant, and she was wonderful! So friendly and energetic, she helped guide me to my beautiful dress! Ordering, pick up, and payment of the dress was straight forward, I did not have any trouble. Definitely recommend Elegant Lace as one of the places brides should visit. They also offer bridal party dresses, mother of the bride/groom dresses, and suits for rent.

Elegant Lace from a different boutique broke hearted - I'd fallen in love with a dress $3k over my budget. My stylist took the time to figure out what it was about that dress I loved so much. She brought me dress after dress until we finally found the one! What is usually a stressful experience turned incredible! Thank you!

onsultant was knowledegable and gave us lots of ideas for our ceremony and reception and really made it a personal experience. I also got to work with her again for trying on my dress at the delivery stage. The dress came in at the timeline they had said, and the sizing was perfect. They also let me come back and get the dress and veil steamed right before the wedding so I would look my best going down the aisle. I've recommended this shop to my future sister in law and hope she's able to find something here too!

She listened to what I liked, asked my budget and was good at sticking to it, and once she had an idea of what I liked, she started bringing in other dresses I'd like. She had such an eye for detail as well. She found a matching belt and a beautiful headpiece to go with the dress. I honestly would recommend Elegant Lace Bridal and Suzana to every bride!

She was able to make suggestions on different possibilities to adjust the things I did not like. She was very knowledgeable and I am so happy she helped me find my dream dress!

It was a wonderful appointment and I would recommend anyone to try there first.

I came to Elegant Lace Bridal on a fluke, I was in the area for another appointment at another bridal salon. I saw this was in the area so booked one here for the morning and if I ...

didn't like anything I would go to the next appointment (where I'd been a few weeks prior) and buy the dress I thought was the one. Well, for starters everyone at Elegant Lace was amazing. They gave me all the time in the world, no time restraints or pressuring me into a dress. After picking out a few I liked, I tried them on and nothing really grabbed my attention. The girl helping me then went and got another dress and guess what, it ended up being THE ONE!!! It was everything I wanted and fit my shape perfectly. I also fell madly in love with a headpiece and veil from here so I signed and sealed the whole deal that one day! I would recommend this place to anyone - great prices, amazing associates who are willing to help, and you feel at ease! I go to pick up my dress this weekend and can't wait to try it all on again and fall in love all over! :) Thanks to everyone at Elegant Lace for making my wedding dress shopping a breeze!!

When we searched, toured and booked a venue at Lake Tahoe as Feb 2017, I thought I had plenty of time to find a dress in Sep 2016 for less than 6 months. Later, we went 12 bridal ...

shops (tried like 70 dresses already) and most of them warned me that my dress would not be ready and altered in 6 months and kindly gave me pressure to make a decision & order quickly or wanted me to order in rush service (additional $300 fee). That gave me lots stress and worried that I had to settle down on a dress I didn't even like. Luckily at the 13th shop as Elegant Lace Bridals, I had sales Dee to greet me friendly and warmly. No pressure or stress. I browsed around and picked 2 dresses. Dee helped me to try them on and adjusted them to fit me. I immediately fell in love with one of it but worried about the price. But turns out the price is affordable and meet my budget. What a luck! We ordered the dress with no hassle. I scheduled bridesmaid appointment with Dee again. That day bridesmaid was late for 30 minutes but Dee were just friendly chatting with me with no anger or rush and waited with patient until bridesmaid arrived. She tried more than 10 dresses and we ordered the dress we love with color we want. That was Sep 2016 and we thought the dresses would come about end of Jan to Mid Feb and we would need to rush to find tailor to alter them. Surprisingly, Bridesmaid's dress came in mid Nov and my dress came in early Dec. So, we got pretty of time to alter! I also got my veil here and I got compliment on the dress and veil from friends, relatives, vendors, tailor, strangers who saw me in dress at the shop & the venue & ski resort to even wedding dress cleaner. Elegant Lace Bridal made my day and relieve the stress of bride to be. I strongly recommend the shop with many styles to fit your needs and sales representative Dee to help you out. I also had my husband to order tux whole set from them and they came perfectly. And they offer discounts on bridesmaid and groom clothes once you buy the dress there so you can save some money to spend on wedding decorations or vendors

ssarily in the mind that I needed to purchase something today. They gave me & my group (MIL and MOB) colored rings we could put on the dresses I wanted to try and then they would pull them aside for me to try on. My MIL actually ended up pulling the dress I fell in love with (I fell in love with the dress and the price tag!) and I was offered the option to pay in full or half now and half at pickup. The only thing I would keep in mind, for other brides, is this store does not do any alterations so you need to get fittings done elsewhere.

er I paid and they made the sale, I literally didn't hear a PEEP from Elegant Lace. I finally called, after it'd been ~3 months since my gown was ordered and I was looking at about 2.5 months for the alterations to be done and I was kinda curious when that dress would be coming in. The first lasy I spoke to said it wouldn't be SHIPPING from Australia until mid-February. My wedding was March 14. I kinda freaked out. And then she told me to call on Monday to confirm. And reassured me that I'd be able to pay some seamstress extra to get any alterations rushed. SERIOUSLY??? WTF?? Are they making it BY HAND? And if they are, why do I need it altered? Can't they just make it custom to fit?? So I called Monday and they told me they were busy and they'd call me back. So then I called again on Tuesday evening because no one called me back on Monday and the woman I spoke to this time couldn't find my order. So she put me on hold for 30-45mins and looked for it. Then she told me she'd call me back. At this point, I was starting to go a little bridezilla, because I'd already paid for the damn dress and now it wasn't even ordered? No record existed? How?? So I made her promise to call no matter what and, to her credit, she did call me back. And, magically, miraculously, wonderfully, my dress just HAPPENED to have come in that morning (I smell BS) and I could pick it up that weekend. Unfortunately, when I went to pick it up, I was put "on hold" at the front counter while three sales ladies (I think one was the owner/manager) discussed dress sizing with another bride (whether or not she should try to lose 5lbs or just get her dress let out). F'realz? I get it, but maybe ONE of you can just give me my dress? Finally, another sales lady came over and fussed over me and apologized for having kept me waiting, while the manager just kinda waved her hand dismissively and said, "oh sure, you can help her." So, three cheers for Vanya and presales, but massssssive fail on the follow-through.

I bought my wedding dress and veil here, my cousin's wife found her wedding gown here and I bought my bridesmaid dress for my sister's wedding from this store. So lets say Elegant ...

Lace has my family's seal of approval. I got great service and a discount after we supported their food drive during the holiday season. A small business with heart. The staff was easy to work with. The only thing that was a hassle was they closed down their alterations department a while ago and I had to go to an independent vendor they recommended. It would have been easier to keep it all in house but a good store none the less.

e she truly wanted me to find the perfect dress for me. I am so happy I went to Elegant Lace, they had almost 200 dress and so many different kinds! My friend told me that she knew a couple of girls that couldn't find dresses anywhere and they went to Elegant Lace any they found their dress. I also went on a day they were having a trunk sale for the brand I wanted, I received 10% off my dress and $100 credit towards accessories. Go with Elegant Lace you will be happy you did!

After falling in love with a dress in a magazine, I called a handful of stores carrying the Stella York line within the area and Elegant Lace was the only store to have received it...

days earlier. They were great in advising me to rush order (since my wedding was three months away), as well as providing me with bra cups and a list of local seamstresses. As close as my wedding date was, they were still great about allowing me to pay in installments. My dress arrived ahead of schedule and it perfect condition. Even though my wedding is now over, I still dream about wearing that dress and what a princess I felt like. Know that you are in great hands here!

This was only the second shop I had been to to try on dresses, and I just happened to love with the first dress I tried on! Of course, we didn't stop there: I tried on about 5-6 mo...

re beautiful gowns before making a final decision. My consultant was great (I wish I could remember her name), and we had a lot of fun shopping. The thing that impressed me the most about Elegant Lace versus many of the other shops I've seen is the large selection. They have a LOT of dresses, as well as a range of different designers, and, most importantly, a range in sizes. Since I am a bridal size 16, I'd had trouble finding dresses to try on in some of the smaller boutiques, but I was able to pick out about a dozen dresses that I liked that I was actually able to try on! After purchasing my dress, we were told that we would get a special deal for ordering our bridesmaid dresses there as well (this seems to be the norm at bridal stores), and we ended up getting the bridesmaid dresses from them too. They weren't as attentive on the bridesmaid side, but were available and knowledgeable when questions arose. I asked for a swatch of the color, and they were able to give me a small sample in the exact color and fabric (which was great), and were even able to assemble a small swatch that matched the color of my dress (which was so useful when shoe-shopping!).

ere. I went in and tried on dresses with Maria for hours (literally) trying on as many dresses as I wanted but didn't find the one. The dress I had intended to try on was two years old and she tried to get it for me to try on when they came for a trunk show. I went back and found an even more perfect gown at the trunk show and even got it for very close to budget. Maria was wonderful but I found others there to be unfriendly and short. They don't do alterations but they do send you to great professionals who are easy to work with. They were by far the easiest to work with and I recommend that all of my friends go here to get their dresses.

I was not looking forward to dress shopping; I get too overwhelmed by too many options, I hate all the hype and oohing and aahing and squealing over something I'll only wear once.....

. Well, Elegant Lace cured my wedding dress blues! I booked an appointment for the first day of a trunk show. I went on a Friday morning and the store was mostly empty. The consultant was a good listener and let me set the pace. I just looked at one design collection, picked out a few, and found the one in under an hour! And I came in about 30% below my budget even with the veil and a blindly belt added. I really appreciated their relaxed approach and good humor with me. Great store, terrific value (for a wedding dress!) and turned my sour face into a smile!

out of all bridal boutiques I visited, I received the best costumer service at Elegant Lace. Each time I went there was no pressure to buy and they never rushed me out of a dress....

I also bought my flower girl dresses there and my mother's dress there. Each time we had the best experience.

Elegant Lace was my last stop in my bridal shopping experience. I lagged on starting the whole wedding process and after a few bumps/stress because of it, Elegant Lace made me feel...

at ease about it without pressuring me even though I knew time was of the essence. I went back for a second time and knew that dress was the one. I decided to go with Elegant lace after the same dress at Trudy’s was almost $300 more plus they would require me to pay an additional $200 in a rush fee (without a guarantee if it would get here in time). (Although it was the complete opposite for my veil way cheaper and faster at Trudy's than Elegant Lace). They did change the date on me 3 times on when my dress would arrive so that made me worry as it was just a few weeks before my wedding but it got here on the first date that they had told me and that was a big weight off my shoulders. The sales consultant at Elegant Lace was Synthia and she was amazing!
