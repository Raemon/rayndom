Sung and his crew are the best videographers in Los Angeles (if not in the whole world. *wink*) I had a privilege to work with Sung and two of his staff when we had our pre-wedding...

shot in Descanso Gardens during the cold, chilly December and on our actual wedding day on January 14, 2017. And all I can say is, they will work for you, worry less on how it will turn out because they have the best God-given talent and knowledge to make your video the best that you could ever imagine. Around 2016, my husband and I were brainstorming on who to hire as our videographers. Trust me, I am such a hard critic on wedding videos because I wanted to have the best memory of our wedding. I've watched many videographers' products and none of them reached my standards, modesty aside. I came across with April Story Films right on the nth page of "the knots" and as soon as I pressed play, I couldn't stop myself commending their work and cried on each videos I watched. I steadfastly emailed him and called him many times. Knowing his busy schedule, I waited and sure enough, he replied back to my query and set the meeting right away. I encouraged my husband to lock this deal in as quick as we can because I got the best feeling that he is such a great deal to have! lol! I am sorry, but I really feel like it is a no-brainer not to have him for your wedding. It is evident on his wonderful finished products that he put his heart out and brainstormed many smart effects on each videos that I watched. Sung, thank you so much for giving us the best memory of our wedding. You are such a great, genuine, and honest person. You are not just a businessman but you are a very kind hearted person who won our trust in so many levels. Thank you so much again. It was such a great honor. Our heartfelt gratitude to you and to your wonderful staff again. To your future clients and to the ones reading this long review looking for a great videographer, don't you every think twice. Email them as quickly as you can. April Story Films is the best in SoCal and surely won't regret every single penny you will spend.

sband and I truly appreciated and needed on such a busy day. They were warm, calm, and extremely professional, making us feel completely at ease throughout the entire process. The final product was beyond anything we could have imagined. It was not only beautifully done, but deeply emotional and so thoughtfully crafted. Watching our film felt like reliving our wedding day through a completely new lens—capturing moments, emotions, and details we didn’t even realize were happening. It was truly unique, timeless, and something we will treasure forever. We cannot recommend Sung and Adele highly enough!!!!!

This review is long overdue, but I have to give credit to Sung and his team for making our wedding video dreams come true! Yesterday marked our 1 year wedding anniversary, and my ...

husband and I ended our day by rewatching our wedding videos and I was bawling with tears of happiness. At first I was hesitant to have a videographer at our wedding but yesterday proves that it was one of the best decisions we made for the wedding. All the emotions and memories flooding in from our big day was made possible by Sung and his team for capturing our day perfectly. Every important moment was captured by Sung and it is clear from the video that he put immense artistic effort into editing everything together. The wedding video is an hour long but it was the quickest hour to fly by because we enjoyed watching every minute of it. We laughed, cried and relived that day. On our wedding day, Sung was incredibly patient, kind and offered suggestions and direction on posing. I am beyond grateful to Sung and his team. This video is something that will stay with my husband and I for the rest of our lives. Thank you again Sung and team, I will be recommending to all my family and friends!

er could have imagined. From the very beginning, they put us at ease with their professionalism and warm presence. They managed to film every important moment without ever feeling intrusive, and somehow made us look absolutely gorgeous while doing it. The artistry of their work speaks for itself. They made us look and feel gorgeous, and captured the atmosphere of the day in a way that still brings us back to those moments every time we watch. Their film background shines through in every detail. Sung has an incredible eye and is a true artist; you can feel the intention behind every shot. It took about two months for us to receive our cinematic trailer, and it was absolutely worth the wait. The end result is something we will treasure forever. They took our ideas and requests to heart, and wove them seamlessly into their vision. Their work is next level, and the gift they gave us was rare and special.

April Story Films was incredible! They were very professional throughout the entire process: during the day they seamlessly integrated into the bridal party schedule (from getting ...

ready to the ceremony to the reception and everything in between). The cameras were not intrusive, most times, I did not notice they were even there - yet they captured all of the best moments! After the day was over, they were very professional and explicit about the expectations and timeline; they kept active communication with us throughout. A couple of weeks later, we received the photos, which were absolutely gorgeous! A couple of months later, the trailer for the full length video was produced using music that we selected; the whole process was collaborative and selecting music was made simple through online platforms =) A few months later, we got the full length (2-hour) movie of our special day! Both the trailer and full-length are beautiful! We were shared the original files for download, and we are looking forward to watching, cherishing, and re-living this day for the rest of our lives! Thank you so much to April Story Films, such a professional yet family-feeling group! High quality production, high-standards staff, and amazing creativity!!

TLDR; April Story Films is a creative, professional and fun videography team at the fraction of the cost of similar vendors in the wedding industry. They were so easy to work with ...

and go above & beyond to produce beautiful work. If we had to do our wedding all over, we would 100% hire them as our videographers again! Thank you, Sung & Adele, for capturing & creating something so special that my husband and I will cherish forever! We hired April Story Films for our wedding weekend in July 2024 and we are SO happy we did! My husband and I stumbled across their work on The Knot & Instagram and we were immediately in awe at their creativity and style. We had a phone call with Sung to ask some questions/logistics and shortly after booked them for our wedding. Sung and Adele drove outside of LA for 2 of our wedding days at no extra cost, and they were so professional, attentive and kind. They were actually early each day and started capturing context, which made me feel so at ease. It was a such a breeze to work with them from before/during/after our wedding! They even made lasting impressions on our families and friends. We got our wedding trailer (~10 mins long) about 2 months after the wedding & Sung was so accommodating with our song choices (he and my husband sneaked in a very special song for me as a surprise!). I watched our trailer everyday for about 2 months and cried almost every time. It was so beautiful! Our families even still show it to their friends!! Five months after we got the trailer, we received our full wedding film (75 min long!!) which Sung so graciously upgraded for us at no extra cost, as we originally chose a package at a lower tier. My husband and I watched it the day Sung sent it to us and it was like reliving our wedding weekend all over again. We are so lucky to have found a videography team to create something so meaningful and capture our wedding how we envisioned it. And everything at a very reasonable price- which was obviously a great touch given how expensive weddings can be especially after COVID. As I’m writing this review, my dad called me and raved about how beautiful and high quality the full video is! You will not regret choosing April Story Films as your videographer for your wedding or any special event!

We had an excellent experience with Sung and his team. Not only was Sung extremely responsive over email in the months leading up to the wedding, and the week of the wedding via em...

ail and text, but we also found that the package we purchased was reasonably priced and tailored to our specific vision and needs. On our wedding day, Sung and the second videographer (I believer her name was Adele) were extremely personable, easy to work with, and made us feel comfortable. Adele also helped me multiple times, fixing my makeup, hair and dress to make sure I looked perfect! We had so much fun working with them and they felt like friends at the end of the day! After our wedding, when we realized we wanted to amend our package to include purchasing raw footage of our ceremony, Sung was very accommodating! When we received the final product - a 7 minute video of our wedding day set to music - we were stunned and thrilled. The video was beautiful and captured our day perfectly! Sung's artistry was fantastic, approachable, warm, and lovely. Sung actually included all the raw footage, not just the ceremony, free of charge. We thought this was extremely generous, a show of good faith, and a kindness that we will always remember. Furthermore, this footage will be something we cherish for the rest of our lives. We are so grateful to Sung + the April Story Films team. Thank you!

I came to know Sung and Adele from a friend who got married and used April Story Films as their videographers. My friend's wedding trailer was incredible and I knew right away that...

I had to have them as my wedding videographers when I got married in the future. As COVID hit, a lot of weddings got postponed including mine, and Sung and Adele were very understanding and patient as they had to adjust through the unprecedented time. In fact, I ended up planning my wedding and notifying them in about a month, and they were very accommodating. Despite being busy at the time, they still tried to make my wedding fit into their schedule. They always answered their emails promptly, and they patiently answered every concern I had. Since my wedding was shorter and much smaller than the usual weddings, I was worried that there would not be much content for Sung and Adele to work with. Nevertheless, they still reassured me that everything would be alright. The wedding day came, and Sung and Adele came early to the venue and brought all their equipments. They were encouraging, and were trying their best to make me and my husband feel at ease during the event. They knew we were stressed out for this event but their positivity made us feel more relaxed as the day went on. Adele even helped fix my hair and dress, and acted like my bridesmaid since I did not have one at the time. Additionally, they worked extremely well with our photographer, and went with the flow. As the day came to an end, Sung and Adele felt like family because of their easygoing attitude. As the days went by, my husband and I received an email from them in regards to the wedding trailer. It was so beautiful, and my husband even said that he did not know they were filming him at some point because they were like ninjas. Our friends and families were very thrilled with the video, and they complimented how lovely the video was. To anyone getting married, April Story Films is worth every penny, and you are in such great hands when you are with them.

When we saw our trailer, my husband and I were amazed; it felt like we were the stars of our own K-drama. The trailer perfectly captured the essence of the day and all its emotions. Words can't fully describe how thoughtful and well-crafted their work was. Since receiving the trailer, we have been watching it every night. If you are looking for videographers who will go the extra mile to ensure that all the special moments of your day are captured, consider working with April Story Films. It was a fantastic experience, and we highly highly recommend them! To top it off, April Story Films does an excellent job with communication turnaround time and updates.

It was incredible. He blends various scenes into a story, and brings the day back to life. We can't wait for the full length video. Would recommend April Story Films to anyone looking for a videographer that brings true emotion and passion into their work.

. Unlike a lot of generic wedding videos, Sung really puts in his heart and soul to capture the uniqueness in every love story. And that’s why I signed the contract without even talking to him!! And of course, It was THE BEST decision I made for my wedding. His video blew my mind, it was intimate, unique, emotional, and just really captured all the great moments of my big day. His team was such a delight to work with as they come with so much passion for what they do. I will recommend April Story Films to all my friends the moment they start planning their weddings!!

were on the top of our list. After researching recommendations from friends and all in the Best of the Knot 2019 magazine, we narrowed it down to two from the Knot. My wife had some prior experience with wedding photography and video and advocated for April story films while I was on the fence. In the end, I cannot think of going with anyone else. ASF is simply the best! From the moment we got on the phone with Sung, he showcased his organizational skill and alignment of vendor/client goals. His work (the cinematic trailer) was beyond our wildest dreams! We received so many compliments on our videographer! He made us feel so happy naturally with his unique engaging personality. On our wedding day, Sung and Nathan accommodated us with last minute requests and provided exceptional videography services. They made us laugh a lot, in a good way!

To be able to see it again, and from different points of view and captured so beautifully, I can't stress enough how this is one of the best investments you will ever make. These memories will be with us forever. Sung and Omar were awesome. Sung was great with communications and easy to work with, and throughout the entire day he checked in with the me and the bridal party. I am the most awkward person ever and didn't have confidence being in front of the camera, but Sung was so encouraging, so kind, and made me feel more confident and beautiful. They also got really great footage of my husband and his groomsmen, and great expressions and moments with family and friends. His genuine care, friendliness, and passion for his work is clear and I would recommend him and his team to anyone. My family and friends also rave about how they loved our wedding trailer, and some even cried!
