I loved working with Susan at Poppy Stone. I had a distinct vision and she executed it perfectly. I decided last minute to add more flowers EVERYWHERE and she stepped up. Everyone ...

Susan created gorgeous arrangements for my wedding, and brought my vision to life. She has a great eye and brings in interesting textures and details. Everything she created - from...

the small boutonnieres to the large wine barrel arrangements - was stunning. She also managed all the candles on our reception tables and the gauze table runner for the head table. Susan is very organized and responsive, and was a pleasure to work with. When the first proposal she shared based on our call was more than I’d budgeted, she was very flexible and immediately helped me figure out a new plan, expertly prioritizing arrangements with the highest impact. I repurposed the arrangements from the wedding for a brunch the next morning, and she kindly allowed me to borrow her vases and return them after the brunch.

's hard to picture everything together and gather all the details of exactly what you want (and fitting it into your budget), but Poppystone was able to get an amazingly accurate sense of what we wanted, and turned it into a reality, all while being transparent and realistic about prices and limitations. I felt fully supported by Susan and her team, and in the end, their design turned out to be more spectacular than I could have imagined! Would highly recommend this vendor for your special day! I can't wait to have an excuse to work with them again!

Wedding florals was one of our more difficult vendors to book, mostly because there is so much chatter around how expensive and fleeting florals are. Luckily for us, we had budgete...

d for this because we felt it was important for the design and feel we wanted during our ceremony and reception. We ended up working with Susan, the owner, as our wedding coordinator works frequently with her and felt her style was consistent with what we wanted. While there was still a good amount of sticker shock from our initial quote, Susan listened to our vision and budget, and was able to modify the cost and specifics of some of our line items to fall within a budget that we were comfortable with. When we saw Susan and her associates' work on our wedding day, we were blown away. From the bouquet, to our ceremony arbor, and the table centerpieces, it was everything I envisioned and then some. Between the pops of color, to the texture, and the beautiful gold accents consistent with our overall design, I had total heart eyes. I never thought I'd be the girl that becomes attached to her wedding bouquet, but I was clutching onto it for dear life and immediately started looking into ways to preserve or otherwise make a keepsake out of it! If you are debating on whether or not to inquire or book, I would take a close look at Poppystones' portfolio of work. I have yet to see a bouquet, boutonnière, arrangement, that isn't just stunningly beautiful and unique. Our wedding florals contributed greatly to the look and feel of our day, and they're forever memorialized in our beautifully captured wedding photos. We have no regrets booking with Poppystone!

Simply perfect. We worked with Susan for our wedding in Sonoma on 6.14.19 and she was incredibly kind and responsive. She was more than willing to adjust some of her initial idea...

s to better align with our budget and what she created was exactly what we had envisioned. We are from out of state and I was so sad to leave my bouquet behind that I packed in in my checked baggage! Needless to say it was a little battered when we got home, but I'm so grateful to have photos of all of her wonderful work (and I did salvage a few blooms to dry and press). Thank you Susan and Poppystone!

I spoke with no less than 10 florists when looking for the right one for our wedding. Our venue was in a garden and I did not want to take away or clash with what was going on arou...

nd us but still of course wanted gorgeous flowers! Working with Susan was a dream! We got on the phone and talked through everything before any contracts were even signed. When she sent over the look book of how our floral design would look I just knew she was the one. Everything was flawless and flowed seamlessly. We made last minute changes and she handled them without any hesitation - it was top notch all the way!

I met Susan when another florist suddenly backed out of booking our wedding, and boy was that a blessing in disguise! Susan was a joy to work with. She provided us with detailed pr...

oposals, worked hard to accommodate our budget while still accomplishing our vision, and had great suggestions to enhance our design. Her expertise was evident and I trusted her completely to make my vision come alive. The week of my wedding was unusually hot for the time of year, which made it difficult for her to get a certain varietal that I had my heart set on, but she still managed to find some and incorporate it where she knew it was most important to me. My wedding bouquet was more than I could have imagined, and her arrangements are truly some of the most beautiful I’ve ever seen. Poppystone delivers high quality product, reliability, great customer service and are just really, really nice people to work with - such an important trait during a very stressful time of planning! Thank you Susan/Poppystone!!

As you plan your wedding, you have a picture in your mind about how you want your florals to look. When you book a florist, you leave a lot of trust in them to bring that dream to ...

reality. This is a scary feeling, but I promise, Susan will make all your dreams come true. We shared with her our thoughts and pictures of what we wanted, but could have never imagined she would not only nail what we wanted, but exceed our expectations all around. She made time to speak to us to ensure we felt heard, she didn't over look a single detail and was a complete pleasure to work with all around.

nterpieces. I loved that Claire completely understood the style and feel that we wanted for our wedding, and she brought it to life through the floral arrangements. We wanted something romantic, organic, and unique. Claire created pieces that were exactly want we wanted and more. I highly recommend working with Claire if you are looking for amazing floral for your wedding.

laire met all of these descriptors to a T! We went through several iterations on the floral bid before we finally locked down the contract. Claire was responsive, flexible, and provided great creative problem solving to match my vision to my budget. In the months leading up to the wedding, I had a few changes to our original proposal. Claire was quick to adapt the changes and answer questions. She made me feel confident in the Poppystone team throughout the entire planning process. On the day of the wedding, everything was exactly as we had discussed. Even in 90+ degree weather, all of the flowers held up beautifully. They were bright, seasonal, fresh, and pulled together our art deco theme perfectly.

ng to say much at all she and I were completely on the same page. Every picture she showed me and description she had for ideas for our wedding 100% fulfilled our wishes. Then when I saw everything in person on our wedding day, the flowers, lanterns, bouquets and every other detail she brought to our wedding, surpassed any vision I had created. Claire is extremely knowledgeable, helpful and is a true artist with flowers. She also gave me many ideas on how I could reuse the flowers throughout different parts of our wedding day to save money. In addition, she gathered everything at the end of the night and generously offered to take the flowers the next day and donate them to various caretaking homes. Claire put together gorgeous flower arrangements and was also a very kind and friendly part of the wedding team! We only wish her work could live forever as the flowers were so perfect and everything we had wanted. We highly recommend PoppyStone.

my initial phone consultation, she offered some great ideas based on my color palette and other elements of my wedding. After our phone conversation, she sent me an image board of sorts so I could see the combination of the flowers and plants she was thinking of using. Claire has a background in art history and other forms of art - this really shows in her flower arrangements. Everything turned out beautifully!
