"Hire your wedding planner first," says Gray. "They'll help you find a venue, build your vendor team and, ultimately, save you time and money as opposed to doing planning in the wrong order. Too often I see couples that try to go it alone and end up spending money unnecessarily, thinking that if they don't have a planner, they can go it alone with the same results."

### Average Wedding Transportation Cost In Los Angeles

Unlike other areas of the country that aren't as densely populated, transportation and parking are two major details you'll want to factor into your Los Angeles wedding cost. The average cost of wedding transport in LA is $1,140, and couples usually spend from $245–$1,460. This number is 6% higher than the state average and 4% higher than the [US wedding transportation cost](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-transportation-costs-tips-trends). Though, depending on what kind of [wedding transportation in Los Angeles](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-transportation-los-angeles) you choose, the price will differ. For example, the average cost of a wedding limo in Los Angeles would be different than renting a trolley.

"While it might not sound luxurious, in LA, parking is like gold," says Gray. "Finding wedding venues that have a parking lot, whether the fee is included in the rental or as an additional cost, is a luxury." As Gray explains, if your venue doesn't have a parking lot big enough to accommodate everyone, most Los Angeles wedding venues will require valet parking or pre-arranged shuttle services for guests instead, which will be an added cost. And finally, Gray discourages relying on rideshare services for wedding day transportation in most situations. "Depending on the area or the popularity of your date, rates could be through the roof or **services unavailable," she says.**

### Average Wedding Cost for Upgrades and Extras In Los Angeles

Los Angeles is home to an interesting range of people, from artists to celebrities, designers and tastemakers, so it's no surprise that the city is at the forefront of creative wedding ideas and trends. If you're getting married in LA, you might want to impress your guests with things they haven't seen anywhere else. In that case, be prepared to allocate part of your budget to wedding upgrades and extras, like unique entertainment (Samantha Hall, owner and lead wedding planner of [Samantha Hall Events](https://www.samanthahallevents.com/) in Los Angeles, mentions live painters, cannoli makers and cappuccino carts) or celeb-worthy catering. Anything that's priced per person will always drive up the cost, explains Hall, so take your guest count into consideration first.

Another upgrade that's not as glamorous but just as important: wedding bathroom rentals. Gray says that portable or additional restrooms are an especially common upgrade in the Los Angeles area, particularly for weddings at private homes or in remote locations. "While every venue will have some kind of restroom, the question will be if they are elegant enough for your wedding and/or are enough for your headcount," she says. And like anywhere, you will need to factor in the small [marriage license cost](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-much-does-it-cost-to-get-married). The cost of a marriage license in Los Angeles cost will likely run you around $100.

## Average Number of Wedding Guests In Los Angeles

According to our data, LA couples invited an average of 108 people to their weddings in 2024. Angeles' proximity to both beaches and mountains, it's no surprise that 73% of ceremonies took place outdoors.

So how does all of this play into the average number of wedding guests in LA? Your guest count will directly impact your budget allocation and the type of venue where you can get married. "In Los Angeles, guest count is a big factor because so many venues can not accommodate guest counts larger than 200, comfortably," says Gray. She shares that her clients are usually spending between $1,500 to $2,500 per guest and invite an average of 100 people—but it's not uncommon for couples to reduce their total number of guests in order to slightly increase their spend per person. Similarly, Hall explains that her clients spend anywhere from $65,000 to $250,000 for weddings between 75 and 250 people.

## What Does This Mean for LA Weddings In the Future?

It's true that the average wedding cost in Los Angeles is higher than many other parts of the country, but with fantastic weather, iconic landmarks and a huge pool of talented wedding vendors at your fingertips, it's well worth the investment. As micro-weddings, small weddings and elopements continue to grow in popularity, downsizing your total guest count is one easy (and expert-approved) way to save money on your wedding. "Inviting fewer guests with a more intentional mindset will mean a smaller overall guest count but allow you to use your wedding budget in a more thoughtful and meaningful way," says Gray. "Stop inviting people to your wedding that you REALLY don't want at your wedding." A smaller group is the perfect opportunity to lean into a fun wedding vibe, like a dinner party at your favorite restaurant or a sunset ceremony at an exclusive beachfront home.

Beyond LA, you can potentially find lower wedding costs if you're open to getting married in other parts of California. Whatever you choose, Hall says that working backwards based on your priorities is one trick to help you make the best decisions as you contend with [how to plan a California wedding](https://www.theknot.com/content/california-wedding-planning-tips). "Some couples may say food, some say photos, some say flowers," she says. "Figure out what is most important to you and that's where the largest amount of the budget should go."
