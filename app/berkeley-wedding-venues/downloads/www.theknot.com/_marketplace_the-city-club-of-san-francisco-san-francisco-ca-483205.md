In February 2023, we had the distinct pleasure of hosting our wedding at the City Club of San Francisco. When we were looking for venues, we were immediately drawn to the City Club...

's remarkable art deco architecture and Diego Rivera mural. That the City Club also provides all of the catering, furniture and table settings was a huge plus because it meant we did not have to coordinate rentals on our own. We and our guests were very impressed by the quality of the food. The City Club's downtown San Francisco location proved to be a logistical convenience for guests traveling from near and far. The rooftop, generously open to couples for sunset snapshots, provided a unique backdrop for photos that isn't typically accessible to the public. Some of our favorite photos from our wedding were taken on the roof with the Transamerica pyramid in the background. The City Club's event coordinator, Marie, proved to be an invaluable asset. Her guidance and attention to detail were instrumental in shaping the success of our wedding day. We truly appreciate the City Club for creating an incredible wedding day!

It is hard to put everything that makes The City Club so amazing into words! We got married there on Sept 28, 2019 and it was our dream wedding in every single way. The venue itse...

lf is breathtaking - it is the perfect combination of city chic, old fashioned charm and modern aesthetics. Our guests loved taking in the Diego Rivera mural, moving from room to room for the different events of the evening, and posing in the grand marble lobby for photos. Our favorite photos from the day were taken on the tiny rooftop that is open to couples for sunset photos - hello Instagram! The cost of the venue rental vs the value of what you get for it (two floors, bride/groom dressing rooms, cocktail hour/dinner/dancing, etc.) is almost unbelievable for San Francisco. From the moment we set foot in the club, we fell in love, and finding out that it was actually within budget was so exciting!! We had the good fortune of being paired with Taylor for our planning and day of coordinating, and I am so grateful that we were. Taylor was with us every single step of the way, quickly answering any questions we had, incorporating any requests, and staying so calm and on top of things that this high strung bride had no choice but to sit back and enjoy the big day :). One thing we worried about was parking, but rest assured on the weekends the Financial District is very quiet and all of our guests were able to find easy street parking nearby. One of our major focuses in planning was having high quality, delicious food - especially because some of our family members were very vocal about their standards for what our wedding should include. We were blown away by the food at The City Club - and our guests were too! We were so pleased with the dinner and had many guests tell us it was the best dinner they had ever had at a wedding before!!! Of course, the incredibly kind and attentive staff made that even better. From the servers to the bartenders to the support staff helping run the event, every single person was so wonderful and helpful and made every guest feel welcomed and doted on! The service was so efficient and our guests had a blast trying different cocktails at the open bar and the passed hors d'oeuvres - of which there were plenty. Even our pickiest, most skeptical family members were so pleased with every aspect of the wedding - and couldn't find a single thing to criticize. Trust me, thats a HUGE deal and the best testament to why the City Club is an exceptional venue! We seriously can't recommend The City Club of SF and Taylor Ingraham as coordinator enough. If you are looking to get married in SF, and want the absolute best wedding ever at highly competitive cost - look no further. You must MUST visit The City Club and see for yourself :)

We are so happy we picked the City Club for our wedding. The building itself is pretty breathtaking--beautiful architectural details, surprise views of the Transamerica Pyramid, a ...

rich color palette in the walls and carpets, and an interesting history. It is also right next to the old stock exchange, which is a beautiful spot to take photos. The whole place has an old San Francisco charm that we fell in love with. The City Club also has a lot of experience hosting events, and everything was just easy--delicious in-house catering (including a really nice, personalized tasting for us and my parents in their dining room), bar, tables, chairs, cutlery, linens, lighting. Alongside the beauty of the rooms themselves, there is very little you have to bring in here, which was a huge draw. We did have some trouble deciphering the package options and firmly nailing down exactly what food/beverage (especially wine) would be there on the day-of. There was sometimes a disconnect between what was discussed verbally and what was later communicated in email. It’s possible this was because we had three different wedding coordinators throughout the 16 months we worked with them. That said, our last coordinator was Taylor Ingraham, thank goodness! Taylor is very good at her job, and so on top of things. She is kind, flexible, and knew her stuff right from the get-go even though she was new. She was a great stress relief in the last months leading up to our wedding. All the staff were friendly, welcoming, and professional. At the end of the day, the City Club is a beautiful space, a good value, and we’re so happy we had our wedding there!

From the wonderful service staff, kitchen and incredible Art Deco backdrop...the best choice about our wedding was choosing each other, the second best choice was picking the City Club as our venue.

I am forever grateful to Sandy, who helped us to coordinate the day, for helping to make it all happen. She was fast to reply, was completely on top of what we wanted, all of our decor, and the day of schedule. I am very hands-on, and she made me feel at ease that everything was under control and I didn't have to worry! It is amazing what we accomplished in 2 weeks to pull off the wedding of our dreams.

We chose City Club as a venue for our wedding ceremony and reception, which was a big disappointment at the end of the day. Initially we really liked the beautiful decor of the ba...

llrooms and layout with multiple rooms. Also, the location in the middle of San Francisco is perfect as it is easy for guests from different parts of Area and out of town (plenty of hotels around) to get there. However, the main issue that we experienced was the low quality of service throughout the whole event. The appetizers were not managed properly at the cocktail hour so many guests barely got a single piece, and bride and groom weren't offered any at all. There was a long wait for the drinks at the bar as well. During the dinner, a number of close family members, and even the groom, were served incorrect main dishes that didn't match their place cards. The food itself was mediocre at best, as bride and groom we even didn't finish our salads and mains. All I can say is that there are plenty of small neighborhood restaurants that can do a much better job with both taste and presentation. We also did upgrades to the bar but after talking to the guests it turned out that wrong drink labels were served. To be fair and prior to posting any reviews, we brought these and more issues to the attention of the venue management the next day after the wedding, but our comments were taken in an unwelcoming manner. City club did refund us about 3% of the total cost, but that can't make up for poor service and the unpleasant emotions during your own wedding.

ie, who was great. When I first visited I thought the venue was just OK, slightly corporate feeling -- but on the day of the wedding, the room really looked stunning!!! They could really do a lot, with a little (I ordered some nice flowers for tables, but nothing much else additional). I got lots of compliments (from some very picky folks) on both the place & food. All reasonably priced, especially for SF! It was also so easy to coordinate -- I planned the wedding in 3 months.

My husband and I got married at City Club on July 3rd and it was just AMAZING! The building is stunning. Many people from our wedding were from out of town and the City Club has so...

much SF history. Each room is decorated beautifully, has awesome views of the city, and the Diego Rivera fresco over the staircase was the cherry on top. Our guests kept commenting how gorgeous City Club was. We had the ceremony on the 10th floor, dinner on the 11th floor, and then the 10th floor was transformed into the dance party. Everything flowed beautifully and it was nice that each room was dedicated to a different part of the wedding. We also bought the cigar bar package and that was a huge hit! At sunset we took pictures on the roof! Now onto Sandy, our wedding coordinator at City Club-she is absolutely the best person in the world to have by your side while you are planning a wedding!! She was super helpful, always quickly responded to my questions and NEVER made me feel like they were silly-even though I'm sure they were! She was beyond friendly, accommodating, organized and EVERYTHING was absolutely perfect the day of the wedding. Everything was exactly what we had talked about and how I envisioned it in my head. The day before the wedding she went out of her way to email us with an idea she had for the dessert table that would create more room in the dance party. We loved it and were grateful to her for reaching out. She organized our rehearsal for the wedding the day before and it was flawless and immediately took any anxiety I had away. Working with Sandy throughout the year was one of the best parts of my wedding planning. She is professional and an expert at what she does. I know my husband and I will continue to keep in touch with her. Shout outs to Brooke and Humberto for all their help as well!

rings, and you have the privacy and intimacy you want for a small wedding. One of the main reasons we chose the City Club was the on-site coordinator, Donna. From the first meeting we felt that we are in good hands and compared to other event coordinators at places we talked to we really appreciated that. Donna was very accommodating to all our needs and desires and made our life easy which is exactly what you want when planning a wedding, especially when you do it in 2 months... When we got to the city club just before our party we were amazed with how great it looked, Donna really made it look elegant and casual like we wanted and everything the whole night, the servers, bartenders, dance floor, lights and everything else was great. The is a really great location with all the service you want and the peace of mind that things are going to run smoothly. Thanks City Club for a memorable evening.

He was very responsive and promptly answered any questions that came up during the planning process. He was also on-site the day-of to make sure that everything ran smoothly. Alfredo kept us on time, coordinated the day-of schedule with our vendors, and made the entire event totally stress-free. All of the other staff was excellent as well - someone was always on hand to make sure our guests had everything they needed. We had multiple guests comment on how good the service was.

My husband and I held our August 25th, 2012 wedding (ceremony and reception) at The City Club of San Francisco and it was a dream come true. Our wedding was classic, yet fun and ...

intimate. We played with the Art Deco and cozy feeling of The City Club throughout our wedding theme. The City Club of SF was so wonderful to work with, Tiffany Wu was our Catering/Wedding manager and she simply ROCKED ( I would request her, but I know that everyone who works their is fantastic as well). She was diligent, enthusiastic and detail oriented, everything you need from the person who is helping you plan one of the most monumental days of your life. They really listened to what I wanted, my BUDGET (I just hate that word) and my vision and then they made it happen! The food and service was great and they let me change things over and over again and never made me feel bad about it. The City Club is wonderful and magical venue, because it appeals to all generations and it has so much character and life. It is an incredible and I highly recommend it! Remember to use your imagination when you do your walk through and be sure to look at the wedding picture books they have for inspiration! Another, huge plus about the City Club is that we were able to keep the party going until midnight and they would have allowed us to go even more into the wee hours of the night!!!! We found that many SF and Napa Valley venues have a strict 10pm end time, and we knew we wanted more of a party and might I say we did!!! The reception was FULL even at midnight. One more thing about The City Club it has a great open bar package, it was priced very well. I can not say enough good things about Tiffany and The City Club of San Francisco!

We narrowed down our search to two contenders and asked for bids from each. We were surprised to find the City Club was more competitive than the hotel we looked at near Fisherman...

s Wharf. We liked it better, but expected them to be pricier. Bonus that they weren't. We had a small and intimate ceremony in another state, and then a huge party for our gigantic family and amazing friends. Dinner for 100 people upstairs, and then a party for 200 downstairs. Pros: The ambiance was so comfortable. It was elegant, festive, and not even a little bit stuffy. The art-deco decor is original and features a beautiful Diego Rivera mural on a grand staircase. Everything leading up to the event was easy. Lauren was our original contact and we worked with Alfredo after booking. Both were knowledgeable, accessible and friendly. The advance tasting was a treat, with generous portions of food and wine to try. The food was delicious, with much to choose from. A nice touch was that they threw in the champagne toast for free (maybe b/c we had such a big party?). I never had one, but I heard the chorizo-stuffed, bacon-wrapped dates were incredible. We loved the mushroom and fontina pastries, as well as the tuna tartare on crisps. For entrees, the salmon with citrus red pepper sauce was delicious. It was rich, but easy to eat with less sauce. One guest who is also a chef commented that the au jus for the prime rib had too much sugar in it but was otherwise very good. Cons: Several of the passed apps were definitely on the high side for price, but it was possible to pick more conservatively if you could live without shrimp cocktail, etc. Be careful on how you plan your drinks. There is a good deal for a blanket rate for the first hour, when people are drinking the most. It's a fixed rate per person. Unfortunately, it includes all guests, even kids and those who don't drink alcohol. So, it's only a good deal if you have a drinking crowd. a la carte sodas and sparkling water were overpriced. Parking is tough if you have a big event. Some guests drove around for more than 15 minutes looking for parking, since some of the garages closed before the event was over. Overall: It was so worth it. We had a lovely night in a gorgeous venue. We keep hearing wonderful feedback from our guests about the food and decor.

e. The space is so beautiful, classy, and elegant. So... we booked it! We worked with Alfredo to make sure that every detail was as we wanted it. He worked with our budget and made sure that everything we wanted (like passed champagne in the lobby before to reception opened) was possible and within the constraints of our checkbook. Alfredo also worked closely with our Day of Coordinator (Dreams on a Dime - check them out!) to make sure that everything on our wedding day went smoothly. The service on the day of the event was impeccable. From making sure that guests with dietary restrictions were served the proper meals without singling them out, to the generous pours of the bartenders, nothing could have improved the service that we and our guests received. Regarding the food, it was perfect. I generally have low expectations for food at weddings - to me, it is either decent or terrible. Not the case at The City Club... everyone LOVED their meals, especially the Peppercorn Crusted Filet of Beef - seriously, I've gotten more compliments on that particular entree than I think is reasonable :-) If I had to go back and plan our wedding again, The City Club would absolutely be a part of it. Our guests LOVED the venue and working with the staff there was a breeze. Thank you, Alfredo, for making our wedding such a wonderful event!

The ambiance of the venue is tough to beat- the art deco decor- white leather walls with amber up-lighting and Diego Rivera mural make for an an amazing evening. The food was fanta...

stic! From beginning to end the City Club was easy to work with in planning our wedding, and the staff pulled off a seemingly flawless evening. We couldn't have asked for more.

My husband and I visited a lot of wedding venues all over the Bay Area before we decided on the City Club for our wedding in July 2010. We loved the fact that the City Club was so ...

private, with two floors of event space so that we could move guests around and keep the event flowing. The space itself is beautiful (although we did cover up the archer statue over the fireplace with a drape) with great views of the city, and there is something about it that just feels comfortable and makes you want to hang out for a while. It has a very old San Francisco feel to that we thought added a cool vibe to the wedding. There is just something very elegant about the space. It was also very convenient for our guests, as they were able to walk to the wedding from their hotels. The wedding ended up being even better than we could have imagined. The space looked beautiful, the staff was all extremely helpful, and everything went off without a hitch. We had our ceremony and cocktail hour on the 10th floor, dinner on the 11th and then back down to the 10th floor for dancing. We got compliments all night (and are still getting compliments) about how much our guests loved the space. The food was also great. As appetizers we served crab cakes, spanakopita, lemongrass prawns and beef skewers. For dinner we had peppercorn crusted filet of beef and pan seared salmon. All of it was delicious. To top it off, the price for the City Club was very reasonable when compared to other venues in the City. Overall, I was very happy that we chose the City Club for our wedding venue. It was the perfect day.

The city club is very beautiful and historical site in San Francisco. All the furniture and architecture is art deco and there is an authentic Diego Rivera mural painted above the...

elegant staircase. The amber lighting made our photographs glow.;We had to deal with three different wedding planners because they would leave or get fired. They started changing things in the original contract on us. A week before the wedding the bride got into an argument with the manager who was completely rude and arrogant. If it hadn't have been so close to our date we would have cancelled and found another venue. At our wedding reception the staff was totally disorganized. The bride's mother gave her a diamond watch and when everyone went downstairs to dance it was taken by (we believe) one of the staff members.

Our goal was to have a very San Francisco city weddinng. The City Club is located in the Financial District within walking distance from the church where we married. It is in ...

an historic building with beautiful art deco decor and artwork. The place is spectacular with great views of the city and a soft elegant atmosphere. The food is exceptional and layout unique -- cocktail hour was on the 10th floor then dinner on the 11th floor then back to the 10th floor for dancing and dessert. There is a gorgeous staircase from the 10th and 11th floor with a Diego Rivera mural from which you and your spouse walk down to make your grand entrance.;I had a very positive experience with the club and the event staff. They were open to making any changes or suggestions we had with respect to the food, the venue, etc. There really wasn't any need to hire a coordinator, which I was thinking of doing, because they handled everything for us.

I love the old feeling and history the City Club had to offer. Having windows in the venue was wonderful. We did not feel we were in a dark ballroom like you do at so many hotels ...

in SF. The venue is a true SF orginal.
