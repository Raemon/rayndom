We were SO thrilled with the service at Pave (both Berkeley and Oakland). We used old diamonds from a family broach and made a custom engagement ring with hammered platinum. We wor...

ked with the designer to create a special piece and receive SO many compliments (almost daily!). Pave also made both of our bands using the same hammering style for cohesion.

i worked with Amy at Pave for over a year on several aspects of our wedding jewelry. she helped me design my engagement ring, and she helped both me and husband select our wedding...

bands. in addition, she worked with me to create a pendant based on a ring of my grandmother's that had a lovely design, but was yellow gold (which i don't like) and was set with a diamond (which i don't care for either). by trading in a few other pieces of family jewelry that i would likely not wear, she and her colleagues designed a pendant in white gold with a crazy beautiful tanzanite stone that kept the spirit of my grandmother's ring yet also completely made it modern for me (it ended up taking care of the something old, new, and blue all at the same time!). Amy was a blast to work with… i saw her every few weeks for a few months as we chose colors for stones in the engagement ring, worked through the details of the pendant design, and chose wedding bands. she was a complete pleasure to work with, and i feel like i gained a friend in the process. when we designed my wedding band, the ring they created didn't match what i described in the design process. i was upset but nervous about saying anything because we had had such a great working relationship and i didn't want to ruin it. that said, i couldn't deal with being unsatisfied with my wedding band, so i talked to Amy and she was absolutely wonderful about it. Pave made me a new ring, no questions asked and at no cost to me, and we worked together to settle on a design that i would be happy with that would also complement the engagement ring (which had a fairly intricate design). overall i couldn't be happier with my rings or the pendant, and my husband digs his ring as well. i stop by Pave on occasion and they always steam clean my rings for free (i never realize how much they need it till i get the clean rings back). this also gives me an excuse to see Amy, whom i've become quite fond of. :) i'm sorry that aspect of wedding planning is over, because Amy made it so enjoyable.
