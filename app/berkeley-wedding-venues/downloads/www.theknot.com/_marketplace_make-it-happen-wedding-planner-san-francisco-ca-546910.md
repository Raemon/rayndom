Robin is hands down the best! My husband and I are eternally grateful for her help making our wedding the most magical day of our lives. She was always amazing about communicatin...

g with us throughout the process, and keeping us on track. Bonus points for adding pictures of rescue animals at the bottom of her emails! Her vendor recommendations were absolutely perfect. She understood the moody gothic vibe we wanted, and made it a reality. As far as we know nothing went wrong, and as far as our guests know nothing went wrong. I don’t want to go into too much detail, but during the evening my husband and I needed to excuse ourselves unexpectedly. She kept the party on track, and none of our guests were the wiser. She didn’t make us feel embarrassed, and made sure I felt better before rejoining the party. Not to brag, but every guest said it was one of the best weddings they’d ever been too. Seriously, five stars is not enough. She is an all star who deserves all the stars! A badass animal lover who knows what she’s doing. Hire her, you will not regret it! 10s 10s 10s across the board!

ess from sourcing and selecting vendors to negotiating prices to reviewing plans and amenities. Robin's location and a sudden injury limited her in-person time, but she became our "eye in the sky" until after midnight and helped us onboard some extra day-of planners two weeks before the wedding and they did a great job despite the large number of moving pieces. Many of our guests told us it was the best wedding they'd ever attended. It became my new favorite day and Robin played a vital role. She was thorough, efficient, compassionate, thoughtful, and honestly well worth it.

Robin is fantastic - we worked with her to plan a ~180-person wedding, and she was so on top of everything. You can tell Robin is a seasoned professional - she knew exactly how to...

handle the timeline, vendors, and key details we would not have thought of. Her experience shows in her professionalism and her attention to every detail. She is also extremely flexible and will listen to your specific needs. Most importantly, however, when working with Robin you can tell that she cares. Other planners felt like they were putting couples on an assembly line, but Robin truly treats you like an individual and understands how important your big day is and doesn't take a one-size-fits-all blanket approach to helping you with planning. Her warmth is one of the first things you notice when you speak with her, and she immediately put us at ease during a daunting planning process. She is also clearly extremely well-connected in the Bay Area, and even if there are last minute things outside of your control, Robin will find a way to solve those problems. We cannot recommend Robin and Make It Happen! enough, absolutely no regrets in planning our wedding with Robin!

y husband and I had to do was enjoy! I truly did not have to worry about a thing and neither did my family or anyone else involved. Robin handled everything and it allowed us to fully immerse ourselves in the day. I also can't imagine having tried to plan the wedding without her in the months leading up to it. There were so many details that Robin thought of, which really turned out to be crucial points, and would have completely blindsided us. Not to mention all the time she took looking over every contract and getting us discounts for services. She saved us a lot of money! She has been in the business a long time, so she also knows of many amazing vendors. Our DJ and HMU artist were outstanding and recommended by her! All this to say, if you are thinking about a wedding planner, just do it! And choose Make it Happen! You won't regret it.

If you are looking for a wedding planner, then you are looking for Robin. We had interviewed with a handful of other planners, but Robin's encyclopedic knowledge of weddings and ...

the surrounding events (along with knowing San Francisco/The Bay Area like the back of her hand) made it a done deal for my husband and I. We had roughly an 18 month lead time for our wedding, and we were looking for partial planning assistance. As I already work in office administration, I figured I could take on the brunt of starting communication with vendors, managing my invite lists, and physically getting key items for the wedding. What I was looking for was someone who could provide vendor suggestions, be our guard rail as we moved forward in planning, and handily take care of the wedding weekend while my partner and I got hitched. Robin always exceeded what we asked for, and her sage wisdom was absolutely invaluable. She treats every question with equal seriousness, and is unafraid to make tough situations as light and easy as she can manage. Frankly, what is giving me the "Wedding Blues" is knowing that I can't keep planning the absolute best party of my life with Robin. With the exception of one hiccup that none of us could control, I truly believe I had a perfect wedding. From how the day started, to how Robin helped arrange our vendors and key items for the wedding, through the ceremony, dinner, and dancing, I simply cannot imagine how the event could have been any better. That is truly in large part to Robin. Thank you so much Robin for everything you have done.

Your guidance and support were the driving force behind securing our dream venue. You effortlessly turned our vision into a reality, and your passion for creating unforgettable moments shone through every step of the process. The list of vendors Robin recommended was an all-star lineup. Every single one of them was outstanding, and it was evident they held her in high regard. This collaborative spirit made the entire planning process seamless. I couldn’t have asked for a better wedding planner than Robin and her team. If you’re in search of someone who is not only professional but also genuinely cares about making your big day special, look no further than Make It Happen Weddings.

I had the pleasure of working with Robin on my recent Sept 2023 wedding in San Francisco. If you are looking for a wedding coordinator, do yourself a big favor and hire her! I had ...

already found my venue and most of my vendors, and am comfortable doing a fair bit of project management on my own, but was looking for the right professional to help me in the weeks leading up to and on the day of my event. Right during our first call, I knew Robin was an excellent fit. She is an excellent listener with straight-forward expertise, and will take your cues on what you want and need. She asks good clarifying questions - but never in a pushy way. Her responsiveness is top notch and I greatly appreciated her thoughtful emails and attention to detail. She handled communication with all my vendors in an effective, positive way and really shone when I was having issues with my venue - she took care of it seamlessly, politely, and without a hitch. I wanted my wedding planning to be as low stress and effort as possible, and Robin was an integral part of that. Even if your situation is not the same as mine - even if you don’t think you need a coordinator! - I encourage you to Robin about your special day. She has worked with so many different brides and events and venues that she is well-versed in handling just about everything. Robin is also just an all around kind, funny person - a real pleasure to work with. You won’t regret it!

Robin was a pivotal part of our wedding, and made sure our wedding day was as perfect as possible. She was actually a referral from a friend whom she had also been the coordinator...

for. From the very start, Robin's experience helped us get started with the planning process. Robin helped us look over vendor contracts, assuring us that we were in good hands. Throughout the months before the wedding, Robin kept us on track with every aspect of the planning process. In the 2 months before the wedding, Robin helped us plan a detailed timeline of the wedding and coordinated our vendors, making sure everyone knew where to be and when. Robin's experience really shone here as we started getting close to our big day. Her timeline was thorough, guiding us through the final stages of planning. She made sure we were on track, and was always prompt in responding to our questions. On the day of the wedding, she kept a perfect balance of letting things flow naturally and reminding us of things that we had wanted to do beforehand. Our wedding day went seamlessly and it wouldn't have been possible without Robin!

ughout the planning process and seamless coordination with our vendors. From start to finish, Robin took a personalized approach. She tailored her support to what we needed at each moment, from reviewing vendor contracts & invitations to offering suggestions for rentals that would have the biggest impact within our budget and goals. She always responded promptly to emails, nudged us when we needed to make progress, and hopped on the phone when helpful. Additionally, Robin made thoughtful vendor recommendations, all of which were amazing. We ultimately hired our DJ, transportation provider, hair/make-up artist, and florist from her list. We observed how the professional relationships she maintains with these vendors (and builds with new ones) eased our planning/communication and contributed to smooth logistics on the day-of. While Robin was a valuable thought partner throughout, she really shined in the 8-10 weeks leading up to the wedding. Putting together our detailed day-of schedule - including coordinating with our many vendors, helping to update/finalize orders before deadlines, and incorporating our input along the way - was a huge task that she kept on track and completed beautifully. Additionally, she ran a fun and effective rehearsal with our families the day before, and she kept everyone organized and smiling on our special day. All that to say, we highly recommend working with Robin. We truly valued her expertise, patience, and positive attitude throughout!

I knew that I was not prepared to pull off the wedding of my dreams alone, and I also knew that I did not want to depend on family or friends to 'make it happen'. That's why I'm so...

lucky to have found Robin! Even just from our first phone call, I felt so much more at ease and excited about the planning process, and knew that I needed Robin on my team. We chose the "month of" package, but really Robin made sure we were on the right track far before then and was so helpful in finding vendors, making decisions, and reviewing contracts. She is extremely quick on email and is willing to go above and beyond to make your wishes a reality. Robin made sure that the venue was set up exactly like I had envisioned and proposed different ways we could use the space and decor, which was so helpful. She also navigated our many excited family members like a pro, and somehow kept everything on schedule, while also prioritizing our wishes as the couple when we wanted some time away. The whole event was a beautiful blur and we got to enjoy it just as much as our guests because we knew that everything was taken care of, and that is priceless. Besides being an expert at what she does, she is also a genuinely kind, caring, and creative person so it was really a pleasure to work with her at a time where there are 100 things to balance and emotions are high. We are so grateful to Robin and would recommend her to anyone planning a wedding. It is so worth it!

Best decision ever. Hands down. If you're on the fence, just do it. It's worth the money. It's worth every penny. It's the one thing I'll be suggesting to EVERYONE considering movi...

ng forward with a big wedding. I could not have done this without her. I've planned company holiday parties before, I've done major events, but a wedding is a whole different ball game. We did the partial wedding package, so basically month of she takes over everything. But even the months leading up to it, I could have her review every contract, get advice on verbiage to add in, advice on varying things I needed to ensure for the different vendors or schedule or tastings. She is very familiar with the University Club of SF (our venue), as well as many local vendors. Using some of them off her preferred list, I got discounts as well as amazing service from EVERY vendor she suggested. Leading up to everything, she walked us through a timeline, helped us make decisions (or helped us to even know what decisions we needed to make), helped us through what needs to be set up by when. She kept me on track, even when I felt so overwhelmed. Day of, I was stressed. I'm just the type of person that notices everything wrong, even if it's things I couldn't control. What I will say, Robin took care of everything when it did go wrong. Ripped my dress off the bustle? She had pins to pin it back up. Didn't have time to eat? She made sure to hold aside food for us. Grandparents left crying? She was there to make sure the room knew of the timeline holdup/coordinated everything to a T. Moving around centerpieces from the aisle to the tables? She could help coordinate it all. Additionally, the timeline and organization of all the vendors coming and delivering and set up, I really could not have had anyone in my family / grooms family handle all of that. Day of, I just really had to sit and focus on getting ready that morning which was so amazing for myself and my family. Moral of the story. Robin is the amazing adopted aunt that takes care of it all. She becomes part of the family for the event and make sure it all works out so you can enjoy your day. I'm so grateful for everything she did for us and would book her again in a heartbeat.

did. Robin is very knowledgeable and gave suggestions and advice and kept the kids on track with timelines as to what needed to be completed. She coordinated well with hotel staff, and the outside vendors ( dj, hotel personnel and kitchen, parking) as well as the wedding party. She was in constant communication every step of the way and great with every little detail came up or potentially come up. At the wedding rehearsal, she came up with creative ideas and had a great sense of humor and we all finished rehearsing in an upbeat mood! The wedding day went smoothly without a hitch! Feedback from friends and family: everyone had a great time; food was good; music was good and dancing was great! Thank you, Robin, for shepherding all of us through the month of July culminating to August 6, 2022 to a most memorable and momentous day!! You truly know your weddings and clearly flexible enough to work with many different people!

Deciding to hire Robin from Make it Happen! as our wedding planner was the best decision we made for our entire wedding! Our wedding was perfect, and it wouldn't have been the same...

without her kindness, organization, and attention to detail. She goes above and beyond for her clients, making sure we got to fully enjoy our wedding day! She was there for us when we decided to go from a 40 to 100 person wedding, when our initial caterer backed out, and when our initial pastry chef backed out. We got married in San Francisco and her connections and longstanding relationships with other vendors provided immeasurable value. I am a type-A person and at the beginning of the process was skeptical I needed help. Turns out planning a wedding is very overwhelming. Now I couldn't imagine doing it without her help and guidance. You can tell Robin loves what she does, and takes pride in giving each couple their perfect wedding! Thanks Robin!!

et. More importantly, you can feel her passion for wedding planning and actualizing the couple's wedding dream. Working with Robin, you don't feel like just another client. You feel like you're talking with a friend. It's much more personal and we enjoyed this connection. Also, unlike other planners we interviewed, we loved how accessible she made herself via phone and emails. Robin went above and beyond to explain and advise us whenever we had questions or needed extra help. And on the day of the wedding, she was so flexible with some of the unexpected changes to our timeline. Thank you, Robin, for keeping everything running so smoothly. Any couple would be lucky to know you and have you as their planner.

Robin was wonderful! My mom and I hired her for heavy month-of planning but she was really able to start helping us plan, go over vendor contracts, and give us vendor references as...

soon as we hired her (about 9 months prior to the wedding). There was one instance where we needed a vendor referral for linens, chairs and china and she saved us a lot of money! She was also great at thinking of small details that my mom and I missed. For example, she worked with the florist to find ways to reuse flowers from the church to the reception and tried to find a way to reuse my bouquet. She remembered details such as having a glass bowl for wedding cards that my mom and I had forgotten about. She was great even in emergency situations! One of my bustles came out from my dress and she had an emergency kit with a safety pin ready to go to fix my dress. Overall, she was efficient, to-the-point, and direct so that there was no confusion. She called us about two months prior to go over a full schedule for the entire day and coordinated with vendors for us so that everyone had a final schedule for our wedding day. She responded to emails very promptly and was also in communication with us when we needed. On the day-of, she coordinated seamlessly with our venue and everything was smooth, on-time, and easy for us so that we could enjoy our day. I highly recommend Robin!

ut her assistance. Robin is thorough, kind, organized, thoughtful, creative, fun, and exceptionally talented. We worked with Robin for almost 3 years—we found her information online in 2019, first planned our wedding for March 2020, canceled it due to Covid, and then rebooked everything for 2022. She was with us every step of the way, from working with vendors to helping make the best decisions possible while dealing with Covid. Her experience and her thoroughness are legendary: every hotel we called about a room block called back and asked us “Why didn’t you tell us you were working with Robin??” Every Bay Area venue knows her. Perhaps most importantly, Robin is a wonderful person. She is kind and caring, and goes the extra mile to make sure your wedding is perfect. You owe it to yourself to work with the best and enjoy the night of your life. We guarantee you’ll be glad you hired Robin! Miles & Monica Married in March 2022 in SF

On top of being great at her job, Robin is personable and will go out of her way to chat with family to make sure all are happy and well taken care of. She was caring and encouraging when those stress moments hit in our planning process – sometimes you just need a cheerleader to get you through wedding planning! She runs a tight ship and keeps extremely high standards – your wedding will run without a hitch and I guarantee you it will be because Robin is two steps ahead of every vendor. Robin just executes – you give her a task and you already know that it will hit the mark. For a couple with demanding day jobs, we felt overwhelmed at the thought of wedding planning. Robin’s planning resources, phone calls, and check-in emails, helped capture all the details that made the big day run so smoothly. Our wedding greatly exceeded our expectations and it wouldn't have been possible without Robin at the helm. We could not have been more thankful to be connected with Robin (shoutout to Jenevieve at the Westin St. Francis for the spot-on referral).

Robin was essential to planning, preparing and executing on our dream wedding together! We often felt like she is a true guardian angel with how she went above and beyond in terms ...

of responsiveness, consideration of things we never thought about, and being there to guide us through the many, many decisions necessary to plan the big day. We started working with Robin in the fall of 2019 and signed a contract with our venue in January 2020. So we worked with Robin planning our wedding during the unprecedented pandemic period. Robin was essential to helping us navigate making plans in those uncertain times. She even helped us negotiate with the venue to change our date, when we decided that was important to us (for the safety of our guests). In the 30 days before the wedding Robin created a detailed timeline based on all the vendors we had made arrangements with, communicated and coordinated details with us and all of the vendors, and worked with the venue on last minute decisions. We had planned an outdoor ceremony but the weather looked like there was potentially rain, so Robin worked with the venue on a backup plan which proved indispensable to making the event run seamlessly. Robin also ran a great wedding rehearsal so our wedding party was prepared, and even though a few folks had missed the rehearsal Robin was able to prepare them too the day of the wedding. Finally on the day of Robin was the first there and last to leave, helping make sure everything ran smoothly. I actually forgot my phone at the venue, and Robin drove out of her way quite late in the night to return it to me! We cannot recommend Robin highly enough for couples planning their big day. Thank you Robin and everyone at Make It Happen!

rked alongside Robin for numerous years which meant that when it was my turn to get married I couldn't imagine anyone running the show other than the wedding pro herself. My fiance and I had a very long engagement as it was (1 year and 8 months out) but then come March 2020 we were in a shelter in place order which inevitably made us postpone our wedding 3 different times. She was there for me throughout the stressful moments of postponing to those detail meetings at the venue and overall was there to make me laugh and smile day of. Being very type A, I planned the majority wedding myself as I do this for a living but honestly even though I know what I love what I do, it was so helpful to have Robin take over as it got closer to the wedding. It's nice to not have to go through the nitty gritty details, relaying info to vendors, updates and changes. When the day comes and something goes wrong (something will ALWAYS go wrong - there is no wedding that is 100% flawless or perfect) it's nice to know you don't have to take care of it. If you have an amazing planner like I did, you won't even notice. That's the best part about hiring a pro, they know what they're doing, know how to improvise, know how to problem solve and most of all they try to shield you from it all. If you're hesitating about getting a planner or even booking with Robin - stop, it's an investment that will save your sanity and calm you down.

First, may I say that I did not think I would need a wedding planner. Boy was I wrong! Let me save you the time in searching for one because Robin is THE ONE!! From start to finish...

she has been absolutely amazing! We were supposed to get married in August 2020 but due to the pandemic we had to postpone until August 2021. Robin has always on point and precise from the very beginning. Our venue was held at the Westin St. Francis and since she used to coordinate the weddings there, it made her as our wedding planner a bigger plus! She knew everyone there and every knew her name and held her with the upmost respect. Robin definitely knows what she is doing and she is always there to remind you when something needs to be done. Although I wasn't the best at responding to emails right away, she took care of everything for us. Every question I had she was able to answer whether from her own knowledge or she would reach out to find the answer for me. Even during the pandemic she frequently checked in on us to see how we were doing with our plans. When we finally go the green light that we would be able to have our wedding when California reopened in June 2021, it was GO time! With only two months away from our wedding date, Robin was quick to get on it and contacted all our vendors and basically did everything for us to make our life so much easier! She definitely took the stress of our shoulders especially when I was in panic mode. The day of our wedding and even the night before she was there the entire time. She was constantly checking in via text to make sure we knew where she was and what she was doing. While it was so hectic with a million things going on the day of our wedding, she made sure all the vendors were where they were supposed to be. Literally called or text every vendor to make sure they were on schedule with our timeline. Even when I panicked she reassured and fixed any problems that would arise. She literally took care of EVERYTHING! At the end of the night she was able to store all of our weddings cards and gifts and all the decorations and put them away in our hotel suite. She was so great. She was bouncing around all day from the groomsmens room to the bridal room. Even during the grand entrance she was able to handle all 12 groomsmen and 12 bridesmaids with all the chaos! She is a perfectionist and so professional. She has years of experience in wedding planning and I am so grateful that she was our wedding planner. Even during the pandemic I would frequently speak to her over the phone leading up to the wedding. She always reassured me that everything will be alright even in times of stress and worrying. I wish I could tell all future brides that SHE IS THE ONE you are looking for! She is amazing with her work and such a beautiful person inside and out. If you want your wedding day to come out perfect, please choose Make It Happen, with Robin. It will be the best decision you'll ever make for our special day!

Robin is very responsive, even when she’s busy, she’ll respond back with a timeline on when she’ll get back to us and most importantly, she follows through! In all the swirling chaos and hurry that was our wedding day, she got things done: from herding our wedding party to the right spots at the right times, to praying the rain away, even to making sure our dessert table is fully stocked. Each time I saw glimpses of her during our day, I felt relieved and at ease knowing that everything is taken care of.

I had the pleasure of working with Robin Lewis for nearly a year while planning the wedding of our daughter held on May 26, 2019 in St. Helena. I had interviewed a few local weddi...

ng planners but the moment I connected with Robin the search was over. From the get go, Robin made feel at ease. I felt I could rely on her to guide me through the stressful wedding planning process. She listened to me, respected my perspective but as and when needed, she did not hesitate to offer candid advice. Most of all she worked diligently with my daughter, who lives in Chicago, to execute the wedding plan and to translate her vision into reality. As expected, the wedding turned out to be an amazing success and we received countless compliments from family and friends who told us that it was one of the best weddings they had ever been to. The wedding itself was much more involved than a typical wedding (almost an 8-hour long celebration) and required a herculean effort to orchestrate and stick to the timeline. This was because both a Hindu ceremony and a Christian ceremony were performed on the same day and involved a change of wedding attires, makeup and hair, and reconfiguration of the Mandap (Chuppah) to an Altar. This required Robin to make numerous iterations to the time line, make sure that the wedding party was on board, and to seamlessly transition from one ceremony to the next. The ceremonies were outdoors-- the day before the wedding it became clear that it was going to rain, so we had to scramble to rent a tent. This. however, would throw off a very carefully planned wedding timeline that Robin had created for the vendors and the guests unless the pitching of the tent started between 6.30- 7 am. Robin, a consummate professional, rose to the occasion and drove 25 miles at the crack of dawn to get to the venue, well ahead of the arrival of the rental company. From then on until almost midnight, she worked tirelessly to make sure that everything went as planned and that every minute detail was taken care of. As a wedding planner, Robin did all that was expected of her and then some. She was easy to contact, and responsive to our needs. She recommended vendors for me to interview, reviewed each vendor contracts with a fine-tooth comb and made sure that even a tiny omission did not go unamended before I signed the contract. Robin conducted rehearsal, and coordinated vendor arrivals and deliveries with our venue. She ensured that ALL our personal items including wedding gifts, mementoes, the guest book, memorial pictures, champagne flutes, polaroid guest pictures, the wedding cake etc. were returned to us safely and that the venue was left clean. It was a blessing to be able to enjoy the wedding day without much stress at all. Robin was not only a wedding planner to us but also like a member of the family. I could sense that she too wanted the wedding to be as perfect, magical and successful as the family had envisioned, and Robin used the tools from her vast and varied experiences to navigate the process and to actually ‘Make it Happen!’ If you are looking for an excellent wedding planner, I highly recommend that you reach out to Robin Lewis.

Loved working with her throughout this whole process, and we highly recommend her to couples planning future weddings! In particular, we want to highlight how amazing and adept Robin was at navigating family dynamics. She did a wonderful job making sure that parents, bride and groom, other family, and friends all felt valued and included throughout the planning process. She had lots of wonderful recommendations and advice during the tasting, about wedding etiquette, timeline organization, and more. Robin was very understanding of our individual needs and let us choose how involved / uninvolved we wanted to be in planning. Robin stepped in and saved the day with recommendations when our hair/make-up person canceled a week before the wedding. She was fast-thinking with other minor details (ex: bride misplaced the bouquet and only realized once the ceremony procession already started! so Robin fashioned together a bouquet from other flowers in a few seconds - guests didn't notice a thing!). She distributed favors when we asked her to do so pretty last minute. Robin also helped us keep on track but was SUPER flexible to any changes we wanted to make to timing on day of, such as spending a little more time talking with some friends during dessert, while still making sure reminding us of timing and making sure we got all photos in as originally planned before photographer left for the night. I can't express how appreciative we are of her help and expertise, and we highly recommend her to future couples!

For example, she accompanied us to our food tasting and asked questions we didn’t even think to ask! Her questions helped us provide delicious meals for our guests on the wedding day! As we got closer to the wedding, Robin was the chain that kept everyone in order from vendors to family the day of the wedding. She is very organized, professional, and personable. Robin communicated with our venue, vendors, and family to make sure the day went smoothly. She does not shy away from any challenge. You will find confidence in her to provide you your dream wedding. Because of Robin, our day went smoothly and our guests loved everything from the ceremony to the sparkler exit. On the day of the wedding, she was there to help from the moment we woke up. She helped with our hotel stay and was the last person to leave the venue at the end of the night. If there was anything we needed at the ceremony or reception, Robin was there to make sure it was done. For example, my matron of honor let me know that Robin made sure she was doing ok during the end of the reception because my MOH was dealing with a very bad case of nausea from pregnancy. Robin was there to make sure that she had water and rest. We cannot imagine what our wedding would have been like with out her. If she is available for your wedding, book her IMMEDIATELY. Your search is over!
