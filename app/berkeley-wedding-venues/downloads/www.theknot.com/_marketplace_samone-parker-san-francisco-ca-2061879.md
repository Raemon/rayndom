like to make any changes. This ensures that your look is really customized! She's also a pro when it comes to clip-in hair extensions; not all hair and make up artists have experience with them. She brings out the natural beauty in you!

he was gentle on my hair and made me look very soft by incorporating baby's breath and crystals into my hair as well. On the day of my wedding, she worked simultaneously with my makeup artist. Together they took their time to complete a finish look in 1 hour and 1:15 minutes, just before my dad came in to greet me before walking down the aisle. I didn't feel rushed, but this moment was so beautiful. I felt like a beautiful queen! I would absolutely work with Samone Parker again.
