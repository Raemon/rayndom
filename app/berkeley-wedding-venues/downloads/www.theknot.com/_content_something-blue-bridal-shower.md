Here's a ["something blue" idea](https://www.theknot.com/content/new-something-blue-wedding-ideas) that's sweet-as-can-be: Surprise the to-be-wed with a gorgeous [bridal shower cake](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-shower-cakes) like this one.

_[Photo: Sposto Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/sposto-photography-signal-hill-ca-620447)_

We're seriously obsessed with this unique [bridal shower idea](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-shower-ideas-we-love). Create a custom bar setup at the shower to serve guests the bride's drink of choice. It could be something classic, like a cocktail, or something out of the ordinary, like boba tea (pictured above.)

### "Something Blue" Bridal Shower Favors

![Blue bridal shower favors](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/85c19cda-50e4-4102-b1c2-01d3efd3feb5~rs_768.h-cr_0.180.1080.1620)

_[Photo: Beige Weddings](https://www.beigeweddings.co/)_

Bid your guest adieu from the blue theme bridal shower with a small gift or favor. Even something as simple as a candle wrapped in a blue box can create lasting memories. Each time they light it, they'll be transported back to that special day.

### "Something Blue" Bridal Shower Place Settings

!['Something blue' bridal shower place setting](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/a81c2354-faff-42c3-921d-9097a19330b7~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1080.1440)

_[Photo: Madeleine Collins Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/madeleine-collins-photography-laguna-beach-ca-1091021)_

If you have the patience to spend time perusing your local thrift stores leading up to the event, you just might stumble upon some serious treasures, like vintage blue china. Of course, if time is a constraint, there are plenty of gorgeous blue place settings available to purchase online.

### "Something Blue" Bridal Shower Macarons

!['Something blue' bridal shower macarons](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/fbb3dde1-147d-4446-8d84-e2b249be37c9~rs_768.h-cr_0.62.933.1306)

These custom blue macarons are too pretty to eat (but that wouldn't stop us from having a taste.) When planning the menu for the bridal shower, ask your local bakery about the different blue desert options they offer. Something unique and special is almost always a conversation starter.

### "Something Blue" Bridal Shower Cocktails

![Blue bridal shower cocktails](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/94ace123-ce4b-4dee-8781-495d61b9f800~rs_768.h-cr_0.50.758.1061)

_[Photo: Julie Mikos Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/julie-mikos-photographer-portage-ca-256173)_

So, we covered the bar situation, but what about the drinks themselves? Well, if you want to double-down on the blue bridal shower theme, you can serve blue [signature cocktails](https://www.theknot.com/content/your-ultimate-signature-cocktail-finder) to guests. One idea we love is placing a piece of blue cotton candy on top of a glass of champagne. When the cotton candy is dropped in, the whole drink will turn blue!

### "Something Blue" Bridal Shower Dog Attire

![Blue dog outfit for bridal shower](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/5788221e-bb09-4042-91a6-c4840ad3e8b1~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1069.1425)

_[Photo: Brooke Mayo Photographers](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/brooke-mayo-photographers-jarvisburg-nc-107518)_

This certainly isn't necessary, but if the to-be-wed and their furry friend are inseparable, ask them if they would like the pooch to attend. A blue dog outfit is a thoughtful gift and it also adds to the theme in an adorable way.
