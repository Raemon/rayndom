My experience with Garnet and Grace was so good! My bridal stylist Jada was fantastic and listened to EVERYTHING I said I wanted and didnt want. I loved how she kept my entourage's...

comments in mind while still making sure I had the last say and my wants were still met. I was flip flopping between two dresses before she brought out the Perfect Mix of both of them and I fell in love with it. The other girls working in the shop were also super supportive and quick to jump in when they heard something they could help with! The dresses are affordable and they offer payment plans which I LOVE. Everyone was so sweet, the atmosphere was easy going and fun, and I found my dress at my first ever bridal appointment.

asset to Garnet and Grace! She made me feel welcome as soon as I stepped in the door, while remaining focused on any bride she was with, including when she provided guidance for me. Like other brides, she helped me find my dress on the first visit. Her patience, intuitiveness, and customer service skills are unmatched. Communication has been great, including text messages and timely responses to any questions that I’ve had. She made me feel at ease throughout the whole process, and I really felt that she understood my needs. There are not enough words for me to express how grateful I am for Nicole in helping me find my dress! Thank you so much, Nicole!!

I had a wonderful experience at G&G. I went with the intent of just having the experience of trying on dresses while having multiple dresses in my Amazon/online site shopping carts...

. Morgan was sweet, personable, and supportive. She included me in picking "try-on" dresses and asked pointed questions to determine my style preferences. She made me feel comfortable enough to decline certain dresses and pick out others she hadn't (including the dress I ultimately picked). She made the awkward process of being undressed with a stranger less intimidating and included my support person, without making the process less about me. She refrained from making any comments that may sway my opinion, but fully supported me in decision making. Even though I found my dress in the first one I tried on, she didn't push to make a sale or end the appointment and let me try-on the ones we had picked out including others still on the rack. I did get stuck with a second potential option, but she was professional in avoiding swaying me one way or another. She gave my friend and I space to converse after with no pressure. She was personable and excited. I left with my dress and I'm so happy! She was such a girls girl and made me feel confident and was my cheerleader. I also enjoyed seeing my name on the welcome sign when I walked in!

I was blown away by my experience at GARNET + grace Bridal!!! The shop was so cute and everyone there was so supportive. My consultant, Nicole, was incredible! She was kind, respec...

tful, and so much fun. Nicole took the time to really learn what I was looking for, what I didn’t like, and what my price range was. Since I hadn’t really solidified an exact style and silhouette I was set on, I gave her a lot to work with. Nonetheless, Nicole worked her MAGIC!! As soon as I put on the first dress, my jaw dropped! She perfectly captured all the things we discussed. The second dress was even better and ended up being my pick! I was shocked at how much I loved every single dress that she had me try on! She picked out veils to go with my top contenders which really helped to seal the deal for me! I ended up finding the one and I was so happy; you know it’s real when you cry!! Thank you GARNET + grace and Nicole for giving me an experience I will forever cherish and for helping me find my dress. <3 If you are looking for your dream wedding dress at an amazing price, book your appointment at Garnet + grace NOW!! Seriously!

This was my first time wedding dress shopping. I decided to visit Garnet + Grace with my mom just to see what styles of dresses I would like. I came into the bridal boutique with a...

n open mind and left with the dress of my dreams! HUGE shoutout to my stylist Nicole who truly went above and beyond during my appointment and made my mom feel like part of the process too! Let me start off by saying how insanely talented Nicole is. All of the dresses I tried on were from the inspiration photos I had sent prior to my appointment. Literally the first dress I tried on became the dress I ended up leaving with and to be extra sure that was my dress Nicole had pulled other dresses to try on as well. My dream dress ended up being a culmination of the best features of all of my inspiration dresses. Thank you so much to Garnet + Grace, and thank you Nicole! Would highly recommend any bride to come and check this spot out for the awesome customer service and great price point for dresses.

I had my bridal appointment to try on wedding dresses yesterday and let me tell you, Hayley was the BEST! I've always hated trying on clothes due to being so self conscious but she...

was so caring and professional I wasn't feeling anything but beautiful. She took the time to review my intake call sheet, listened to what I was looking for and really hit the mark when pulling dresses. Thanks to Hayley, I was able to find the most beautiful dress that I felt drop dead gorgeous in. Overall, I had an amazing experience and highly recommend Garnet and Grace to brides looking for their dream dress.

I found Garnet & Grace on Yelp on a whim, and was lucky enough to schedule a same-day appointment. I wasn't expecting to find the dress that day, but I'm so glad Erika was able to ...

accommodate my last-minute appointment and help me find my gorgeous gown! Erika was incredibly attentive, sweet, and honest with her feedback. She asked for inspiration photos and was able to suggest dresses that matched the style I was envisioning. I also appreciated that she spoke Spanish, which made my mom feel included in the conversation. I would absolutely recommend this bridal boutique, and especially Erika! She was a true pleasure to work with, and I'm so grateful for the experience and how everything turned out.

If you’re looking for your wedding dress in the East bay I definitely recommend Garnet + Grace with Hayley as you’re looking for your wedding dress!

G+G was my second stop on the road to finding my perfect dress. I walked in not really knowing what to expect and a little nervous after I had a not so great experience at another...

bridal store. Erika was my personal stylist and she welcomed me and really made me feel comfortable. She really took the time to listen to me and after trying on a few dresses I had picked out that we liked but weren’t quite it, she came back with what turned out to be the absolute perfect dress for me. I don’t think I would’ve found this dress without Erika. I will recommend G+G to my friends and family and if you’re looking for your dress, please stop by and let Erika help you!

They had good prices and it was so nice that I took the dress home since I'm working on a short time-frame! Highly recommend going on a weekday if you can as it helped me feel settled and not rushed. Thank you Garnet + grace for a special memory and a dream gown for my big day!

amount but the one she picked based on my preferences ended up being my dress. In the start I was extremely stressed out and nervous and she washed all of that away. She made me comfortable and happy and she deserves a raise. Thank you so much Hayley!

If I could give G+g more than 5 stars, I would! I learned about G+g through a friend who informed me about National Bridal Sale in July 2024. G+g was my last appointment and I have...

to say that it was the best wedding dress try-on experience I’ve ever had. Coming to the appointment, I was under the impression that, like other boutiques I went to, I’ll just be changing in and out of the gowns and leaving with 1 “maybe” and a bunch of “no”, but my stylist Morgan changed it all around for me. I was greeted with very welcoming and friendly staff, then Morgan sat down and ask me about my vision and budget. Since I already had a specific style in mind from my other appointments, I was able to share that with Morgan and she just went and grabbed the dresses that matched exactly my vision. I think to say that Morgan helped me find my dress is an understatement. She took my vision and made it 1000000% better. Morgan did not rush me, but instead took the time to give me suggestions, put different veils and accessories on me, pull me more dresses to try, etc. She even went as far as pulling me dresses that won’t require much or at all tailoring to save me some money. I left saying yes to the dress of my dream, even if the price was more than what I’ve budgeted for LOL (worth it!!!). Ngl after I said yes to the dress, I was low key sad because that means the wedding dress try-on experience has ended, but at least it ended on a sweet, sweet note! If you’re looking for wedding dresses, I highly recommend you booking an appointment with G+g. Even if you don’t find your dress there, you will definitely work with someone who helps you narrow down your search with a lot more quality and attention.

The dress was lovely and the staff member who assisted me in picking out my dress was kind and clearly wishing to be helpful. The day I bought the dress was a lovely time. Then I ...

was surprised when I went to their seamstress, the estimated alterations were double the max the store quoted me. I called the store to better understand the difference and where the miscommunication came from. The manager outright lied to me and when I was able to prove the lie from information in an email and from the seamstress the manager did not care. I was told I could contact the store owner because the manager refused to listen to me or help me with any supportive information. I emailed and called the store owner multiple times and received no response. Once you pay for the dress they do not care about you. The manager and owner showed this to me first hand. After over a month of trying to speak with the owner over email or phone I gave up. Now that the wedding is over I am being sent spam emails from them. And when I emailed to ask if the email was an auto message the owner replied immediately saying yes it was. She was able to reply to my question within hours when it was after my wedding and in regards to auto messaging but when I had an honest concern and detailed emails asking for a reply she was silent. I am so disappointed by the manager and owner which is especially sad since the saleswoman was so pleasant and kind. Be careful with information provided here and check all quotes.

my dress. She went the extra mile and even helped me envision how my dress would look with the customizations I wanted. She was wonderful and defintely made it a day to remember. The dress also was under my budget of $3k and they have alot of options to choose from. They are off the rack so I would say if you really, really love the dress then go for it.

She and the other girls are some of the most kindest, sweetest, and most sincer people I have truly met in a very long time. They all listened to me, to what I was thinking. Helped picking styles that I might like, that would look AMAZING. By the time I had to leave, I truly did not want to. They all made me feel so comfortable being there with them. I did not want to leave. The dresses are beautiful. The atmosphere is warm and inviting. The girls there truly make it the bridal shop to go to!!

well to have family members and friends participate in wedding dress shopping. I felt a bit nervous about the process of wedding dress shopping (even though this was my second time going to try on dresses) and Garnet and Grace made me feel comfortable and at ease. I specifically want to mention Hayley, my stylist. She did a wonderful job! From looking at my inspiration board and picking out dresses that best matched my unique preferences. She was on point when it came to sorting out styles and features of the dress, helping me identify what aspects of the dress I wanted. She means business in the best way possible! I tried on about 10 dresses, and eventually found the dress I will wear to my wedding! Hayley patiently walked me through the timelines and cost, I appreciated the same day decision discount. I highly recommend this boutique shop as well as Hayley!

I'm super happy with my dress and it was a relief to buy a dress off the rack and not wait 6-8 months for ordering and shipping as I would have with other stores. I'd definitely recommend Garnet and Grace!

y and amazing person! She was so warm from the start and made me feel at ease for a process that was very new and slightly intimidating to me, not knowing if I would find the dress and also not really sure on where to start. Well, before I even arrived, they called me and shared how the appointment would go (I booked the VIB appointment which came with cute Bellinis and yummy cookies, candy, snacks, totally worth it for myself and my mom and MOH that came with), on the pre-visit call they also asked me what type of dresses I like, my wedding colors, venue, and also to gather examples of dresses I liked - and Christina expertly used it to pick dresses for me! Literally, the first dress that she picked was THE DRESS. I tried on 6 more to be sure, which Christina even encouraged, and she made sure that we stayed within my budget. The dress I fell in love with came in under budget and it is GORGEOUS. Every dress I tried on was absolutely beautiful but mine is so ME and that's how you know its the one. Throughout the appointment Christina affirmed me and was like an extra friend cheering me on along with my mom and MOH. I truly felt Christina's warmth and care throughout the appointment, I did not feel rushed in the least bit and I could feel that she truly wanted me to find the dress for me, and not try to upsell or anything. Thank you Christina! You made this milestone so special for me and my guests! I also love their storage option packages where you can choose to store your dress with them until 3 months prior to the wedding - great for living in an apartment and/or having a nosy fiancé lol. They also contract with someone to do alterations so I scheduled that appointment before I walked out the door, super convenient! Everyone was so nice and you get to take a cute picture on their flower wall which was so special. I wish I could go again and again!

d to try and find my wedding dress (it was a success, I said yes to the dress). My experience was so amazing. I will remember it for the rest of my life and that’s all because of Hayley. She is truly an angel sent from above. From the moment I walked in I was still feeling nervous, but Hayley was so inviting and genuine. She effortlessly made me feel comfortable and excited to try on dresses. She asked me a couple of questions to get a feel of my wedding ideas and even gave me some professional advice on my color scheme which I am grateful for. It seemed to only take Hayley a couple minutes to figure me out. She came back with the first 4 dresses and was spot on, they were everything I could of dreamed of and more. She is so good at what she does, I didn’t even have to look at any more dresses. It’s like she knew exactly what I was looking for even though my thoughts and ideas were so broad. I am really impressed with the fact that the first dress I tired on is the dress I ended up buying. Hayley went above and beyond for me by offering advice and even checking up on me after the dress purchase. She radiates great energy and is such a joy to be around. I am so happy I got to meet her.

at I wanted. At one point, I felt like everyone wanted me to say yes to one dress but I wasn't quite sure and was really on the fence, and Christina encouraged me to try more dresses and helped me figure out exactly what was missing. Without that extra encouragement and her understanding of my indecision, I never would have found my perfect dress (and at a very discounted price!). Also, two of my best friends couldn't attend in person, but they allowed me to use their Wi-Fi to video chat my friends into the appointment. Overall, my entire experience at G+G was amazing and I'd highly recommend it to any bride looking for a discounted, beautiful dress and a good bridal dress search experience.

the whole time. She always had something positive to say and was able to keep her cool when stress got to us. She was able to take my budget into consideration and never felt like she was trying to up-sell me anything. My being happy and finding the right dress was what mattered to her. Super appreciative of her staying after closing while I decided between two dresses and then debating my finances. In the end, I found a dress that suited my personality, figure and pocket. I was also very, very happy to be able to try dresses on. My first stop was a chain bridal store, and it left me with much to be desired. Thank you to Hailey & G + G. I hope to be able to add to this post after the big day with pictures included. :)

I had a wonderful experience at Garnet and Grace! Booking my appointment was super easy online. Then a week before I had a phone call with one of the consultants to talk about what...

styles I was interested in. That was super helpful and personal and made me feel excited going into the appointment. When we arrived at the store we were greeted right away and shown to our try on area. Christina was my bridal consultant and she was amazing! Her energy and enthusiasm were awesome and she made me feel comfortable with asking questions. Once I told her what styles I was looking for she picked a great selection of dresses. I ultimately found my dress here and I was so happy! Christina picked out the perfect dress for me and it was in my bridal budget which I appreciated so much! Purchasing the dress and layaway plan was simple and efficient as well. Overall G+G made my dress shopping experience memorable and stress free. Thank you so much! I would definitely recommend this shop to any brides looking for affordable, beautiful dresses that want stellar service as well!

After booking my appointment on-line, Haley and Christina contacted me to gather pertinet details. What type of dress was I looking for, Silouhette? Fluff? Length? Size? Material?W...

hat type of venue? What weather conditions and time of year? All of it was in preparation for my appointment. Upon arrival, Haley greeted me and immediately set me up with a dressing space and "friend" space. She let me and my friend browse but also began gathering the dresses she thought matched my criteria and brought them to the dressing space. She then helped me into and out of every single dress I tried on. From holding me upright, to zipping me in. She was very knowledgeable, friendly, fast, and helpful, especially with fitting me in and clipping the dress so it fit "just right." Great customer service! Perfect experience. Recommend 10/10!

Sooo happy I decided to make an appointment at Garnet & Grace Bridal Boutique. A week before my appointment, I received a call from Christina to get an idea of what I was envision...

ing. She had me send pictures of inspiration dresses, which I loved because I felt like that way my stylist would have a better idea choosing my dresses & they asked for a budget as well so they wouldn't go over it. When I arrived at my appointment, everyone was super welcoming, Hailey was my stylist & she nailed it with my dress choices. The very first dress I tried on, I fell in love with, we tried on a second one just to see if there were any doubts on the first dress but there wasn't, my bridesmaids & my mom couldn't match the reaction to the second dress like the first one!! Hailey is super personable as well she makes you feel really comfortable & understood asking questions not only about the dress but about your life as well. If you're dress shopping, do NOT pass on the chance to book an appointment with Garnet & Grace!!

anted. I appreciated that we were able to talk about what I wanted in a dress in our call before the start of the appointment which saved time and allowed her to be prepared in what I was looking for. I didn't necessarily think that I would be leaving with a dress because after searching four other stores, I was starting to be more skeptical that whether the dress I was envisioning doesn't exist. With 20 minutes left in the appointment, she pulled a wild card selection dress that I would have never envisioned myself in before and as soon as I tried it on, I got this immediate feeling that I found my dress! I really appreciate how much she was patient with me and her expertise definitely helped both of us succeed in the end!

I had no idea what I wanted and with the few words I said to her, she somehow was able to encompass exactly who I was and I left with the most perfect wedding gown in less than 45 minutes. I never felt pressured and enjoyed every second of the process! Thank you Christina!

Garnet and Grace was my second bridal shop I visited. I found dresses I liked at another store, but I wanted to check out at least one more store just in case. I am so glad I did! ...

They were very transparent and informative even before I came for my appointment. They called me to get some information on what kind of dress I’m looking for beforehand, so my stylist, Hayley, was able to have a better idea of what I’m looking for. Hayley did an amazing job at finding dresses that matched my interests and even made me feel confident in taking some risks and trying something different. Her sweet and positive energy made me feel confident and comfortable during the process and I like how she included my family during the appointment as well. My favorite part of the appointment was when she brought out a dress that didn’t really meet my initial preferences but asked if I’d be interested in trying it on anyways. I didn’t love how it looked on the hanger, but once it put it on, I was so surprised that I really loved it and my family loved it as well! This dress that Hayley picked based on her professionalism and creativity ended up being my wedding dress!!! I am still so impressed with her and she truly is so talented and I am so glad that she is sharing her talents and expertise in the wedding dress/ bridal field!

I had such a great experience with them and got so many compliments about my dress. Thank you, Misha and Garnet + Grace!

100/10 recommend making an appointment here! I came with my mom and MOH, to which we were kindly greeted as we entered and proceeded to check in. Sierra was my bridal assistant and...

I’m so so happy she was! I had previously been dress shopping at another boutique and it was completely overwhelming. I told Sierra that once I had entered the fitting room there- I never left it. I tried on 7-8 dresses and just kept getting handed them. It was exhausting and rough. I was handed dresses 10 sizes too big, with no help putting them on. However, that was NOT the case here at Garnet and Grace with Sierra. She listened closely to my experience and the things that I’m looking for. I originally told her I didn’t think I’d be purchasing anything at this time, and that I’m just trying to get an idea of what actually looks good on me. We tried a range of dresses- from what I wanted to the complete opposite so we can rule out any “what ifs”. Sierra helped me confirm that my inspiration was true to what I wanted. She then pulled out this absolutely gorgeous dress, which was even better than my inspiration picture since the underlay is blush. My favorite color is pink. THIS IS THE ONE. I felt it. I knew it. We all knew it. However- we did have another appointment the next day at another boutique and I told Sierra that I can’t buy the dress today, but if it’s still here tomorrow I’ll be back for it. I had to go to the other appointment just to confirm that the dress that Sierra pulled for me was IT. And it was. We were back the very next afternoon, credit card in hand. Sierra, you made my dreams come true and you are an ANGEL. You gave me the experience of a lifetime that I could share with my mom and best friend. I thank you from the bottom of my heart. To the store: y’all got a good one there, don’t let her go!!

I went in around January 2022. I was already stressed out finding a dress because I had visited another place and I was overwhelmed with budgeting. I arrived without an appointment...

and the lady there was very sweet to help me out. Luckily she had time to do that. I told her my budget including alterations and she was able to find a cheaper dress exactly how I wanted it to be. It was an easy find and you buy off the rack. My dress wasn't expensive but alterations was. I aquired long sleeves, lining to not be see through and hemming. My alterations was similar cost as my dress, but that's another story (and not part of granet and grace). The main reason I took off one star because I came back again to look for a veil. Another lady, very sweet, helped me out to look for one. Their veil choices were not very appealing or were too simple to my liking. We found one that was closest to what I had envisioned but had flaws on it (such as loose beads/stitches) and they don't fix them. We asked nicely if the lady in charge can provide a discount or some assistance. Not once did she speak with us, nor looked at us and told the employee no discount. Which is kind of sad because you buy in the exact condition is what you get and the service from the lady in charge was just plain bad. My mom and I left the place without a veil. I got my veil elsewhere and won't be returning, hopefully I don't need to buy future dresses hehe

Searching for a wedding dress is one of the most important and hardest things to do. After couple dress shopping at other bridal shops, nothing really stood out to me and some were...

rather expensive. I came across Garnet and Grace and learned that they were an off the rack boutique, I've seen other brides who purchased from them and bought beautiful dresses for less. I went in with high hopes and I was excited! They have a beautiful selection of dresses and my stylist Sienna was the best!! We tried on multiple dresses and they were all within my budget. I ended up choosing a dress but was a little hesitant about it, Sierra was patience with me and allowed me to go back to the shop to try on other options & the dress I purchased. I was glad I was able to go back and finally found a dress I loved! It was perfect and I couldn't have asked for a better stylist. If you don't know where to start dress shopping, look no further and go to Garnet and Grace! You won't be disappointed and please ask for Sierra!!! I highly recommend :)

so i kind of had an idea about what i'm looking for. Sierra, my stylist at G+G, listened to what i liked and paid attention to not only what i was saying, but how i was reacting to each dresses she had me try on. I was so surprised that each dress she was pulling kept getting better and better. she took her time to ask me questions and helping me out, because i am so indecisive lol. i didn't feel rushed at all, compared to the other 2 stores, and her undivided attention made me feel so special. Liz and Jhamesha were also a huge help!! i really cant reiterate enough how special and amazing this bridal store is; from the amazing stylists, wonderful customer service, down to the unbelievable prices. this store is every brides' dream!! an unending thank you to Sierra!! you are amazing and wonderful and so so lovely!!
