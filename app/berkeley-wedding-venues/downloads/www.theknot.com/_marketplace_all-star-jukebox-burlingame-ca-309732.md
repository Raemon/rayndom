I highly recommend All Star Jukebox and will absolutely be hiring them again.

e professionals - they knew how to read the room and keep everyone on the dance floor having a fantastic time. Band manager, Brian, was available, flexible and easy to work with. He went out of his way to accommodate our preferences and needs. He even did a site visit in advance to make sure all would run smoothly on our big day. Day of the wedding all executed well, even with a more complex venue. ASJ handled all sound: ceremony, cocktail hour and reception. We had 8 musicians and every band member was exceptional! The saxophonist was a true stand out. We asked for a New Orleans style second line recessional leaving the ceremony walking up to cocktail hour and he led the pack - playing his heart out while leading us up hill. Truly a best in class vendor! Highly recommend!

We really wanted live music for our wedding and chose the option for a 8 piece band which also included MC services for our grand entrance, dinner announcements and speeches. The band even played for our first dance and parent dances which was truly special! They learned a song for us that we requested to get the party going after a group photo on the dance floor which really shows that ASJ goes above and beyond. The dance floor was packed all night long and everyone had the best time! We received multiple compliments from our friends and family about how fun the band was! I would highly recommend ASJ for your event!

alking to Brian our communications were easy and the process of working with them smooth. Then a few weeks before the wedding we talked with Brian and Cristian, and worked out some ideas of what music we wanted played (from their huge song list) while also giving them leeway to use their expertise and read the room. It was a blast - they are fantastic musicians, had great energy, and kept the party moving the whole night. We received many compliments from all our guests about ASJ and would not hesitate to book them again in the future!

Over a year out wedding planning for the biggest day of our lives, I discovered the incredible All-Star Jukebox. Live music is the central part of our relationship. Going to weeken...

d shows and festivals is a regular activity, especially in the jam band scene and with Phish in particular. I had screened dozens of groups on the mission to find a band that I felt could accomplish this kind of vibe and execute my vision of a great concert at a wedding, with classic wedding songs and a mix of some of my special jam band song requests. Mind you, Phish/Trey Anastasio has complicated music that not every band could pull off and to say that All-Star Jukebox absolutely took the night to the most amazing level would be an understatement. This group delivered in spades more than I could have ever dreamed. I was a little neurotic in how I wanted the night to be and planning with Brian could not have been easier. He is truly the best partner. I would say that there was some give and take and compromise on what the band could do, but there was not. To my astonishment, I do not care how many alterations I made, or what song I asked if he thought the band could do and every single time he came back with a “Yes.” I dare anyone to throw them a piece of music that they cannot master and deliver on the day. In the jam band scene, songs are often extended and taken to another level with improvised segments and at our wedding, All-Star jukebox was given the freedom to take songs for a ride and every song was given the royal treatment. Think a song like “Shout” with a few more “little bit louder nows…” type of thing where the crowd is going absolutely nuts or the horns or piano just having their own solos on songs that you want to go deep with. So incredible. I cannot recommend ASJ enough. Plan any type of party with this crew and let them know the theme, the vibe, the songs, whatever and I will guarantee an absolute dance party. I am still waiting for a lot of the professional videos taken from the wedding but I had to get the show closer on my own camera which I posted to YouTube (It is shaky but you can hear how great this band can be performing a song that usually closes out epic Phish shows). Please enjoy and reach out to All-Star Jukebox to have them decorate your memories and time with their talent. It will be the best decision you made. Tip from a wedding planner vet: Don’t stress, open bar and All-Star Jukebox is all you need (And we are sober couple, so you do the math). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0Gn6HvYpxY

Without a doubt, trusting All Star Jukebox to set the music tone for our wedding was one of the best decisions we made in our entire planning process. It may even be among our bes...

t decisions ever. Marty and the other 7 amazing musicians we hired for our wedding brought energy, excitement, and fun to our celebration - we were blown away, our guests were blown away, and at the end of it, we wished we had more time to dance to their incredible music! If you don’t feel like reading the rest, here is the summary: go with All Star Jukebox, seriously! Working with All Star Jukebox was easy and straightforward. They even had a night where you could go and listen to the musicians practice - a teaser of what the celebration will be like. Communicating with the team was easy and any questions were answered promptly. If you look on their website, you can see a vast list of songs to choose from. There was something for everyone. And if they didn’t have your song, they learned it, as we experienced with a beautiful rendition of Bob Marley’s “Is This Love.” We gave All Star Jukebox a list of songs we definitely wanted them to play, and guidance for other music during the night. They picked an assortment of songs that perfectly matched our vibe and kept everyone dancing right up until the end of the evening. All Star Jukebox didn’t just handle the music during the reception. Marty was the DJ during our ceremony, ensuring that our walking-down-the-aisle songs were perfectly timed. A fantastic guitarist and bass player duo from the band set a relaxed tone for our cocktail hour. The entire band opened the night with our first dance and led everyone through a lively rendition of “Hava Nagila.” Marty was a pro as emcee and he kept everyone on schedule, from dancing time, to speech time, to cake cutting time. He knew when everything needed to happen and made those transitions smooth. If you want great music at your wedding and want a major part of your celebration handled by true professionals, then you have to go with All Star Jukebox. \- D&C

On the day of the wedding, the band’s magic touch really came through as it was raining on our wedding day (we had an outdoor venue!) and we really needed a true professional to handle it. The band KILLED it! Everyone was up on the dancefloor and having a great time (even though it was storming outside). The music sounded amazing and our guests are still raving about our music and band from that day. The band brought energy that really made the wedding unforgettable. We are very happy with our decision of hiring AllStar Jukebox and cannot recommend them enough.

We brought in All Star Jukebox to handle all of the music for our wedding: Cocktail Hour, Ceremony, Dinner, and Reception. They customized everything to our specifications and were...

extremely collaborative during the entire process. We had a very specific vibe that we were looking or and they refined their setlist to match everything perfectly. They were very organized and coordinated seamlessly with our venue and vendors. My wife and I were blown away with how well the evening went and cannot recommend these guys highly enough. They are great musicians and entertainers that put on a fantastic show!

All Star Juke Box is a team of incredibly talented musicians that rock the house and leave you with memories that will last a lifetime. We never left the dance floor. Every guest a...

t our wedding was on their feet, dancing the night away. ASJ DJ’d the ceremony, cocktail hour and dinner working with us well in advance to establish our song list. They then switched gears and performed a 4 hour set that we will be talking about for years. If you’re debating DJ vs Band for your wedding or event, go with the band! And go with ASJ, you won’t regret it.

ing all night. Brian was so patient with us, especially when we regularly asked to change the number of instruments and had difficulty making a final decision on our ceremony and special dance songs. He also helped guide us through the set planning process to make sure ASJ played our favorites and that we had the right balance of dance and slow songs. Brian went above and beyond to learn and play our fairly untraditional songs for the ceremony. They truly exceeded all expectations - not just ours, but those of our family members and friends, both young and old. In the days, weeks, and months since our wedding, guests keep telling us how amazing ASJ was! Thank you for all of the wonderful memories!

We had an absolute blast with All-Star Jukebox. As the bride, the most important thing to me in the whole day was to have a non-stop dance floor– and my, did the band do their part...

! The band has got RANGE (70's Mo-town to today's top hits), soul, and just the most fun personality. 2 years later, wedding guests still ask us who our band was and how we found them. Both Brian (manager) and Marty (band leader) were super responsive and accommodating to our requests, which included everything from attending a showcase to hear the band, to playing our favorite songs, to even working behind to scenes to line up some surprise performances (unbeknownst to me). Highly recommend to anyone looking to hire a band... and please invite me to the party!

Allstar Jukebox is the BEST. As we were planning our wedding, something we knew we wanted was an awesome band to really make our party fun and memorable. Allstar Jukebox not only g...

ot everyone up from their seats and dancing, they MC'd the entire reception with such enthusiasm, it created a whole other liveliness we didn't realize would be so important. They played perfect songs that fit the energy of our guests. At one point, guests broke into a massive conga line that swirled through the entire reception building! It was important to me to have slow songs sprinkled into the song line-up and Allstar Jukebox read the crowd perfectly to make this happen. They transitioned from fast songs to slow, then had no problem getting the energy back to faster songs. Besides the reception, we hired the band to run the sound for the ceremony and play background music during the cocktail hour. Music is such an important element to a wedding and knowing we could 100% trust this group, was such a relief. We had a 7-piece band, including 2 singers, drums, bass, guitar, keys and trumpet. Pricing is fair and totally transparent, no hidden fees! Highly recommend this band for a wedding or any large event. Can't wait to find an excuse to book them again!! Thank you ASJ!

BOOK THIS BAND! Allstar Jukebox is as good as it gets. Their sound is great, vocals outstanding and energy matches the crowd. We recently hired Allstar Jukebox for a wedding i...

n Napa in August 2016. They absolutely rocked our wedding reception and we couldn't be happier hiring them for the gig. The bands is comprised of a group of dynamic and talented musicians. ASJB has a deep set list ranging from doo-wop to pop and classic rock to r&b and love ballads - they can play the entire range of wedding must-haves. The band continues to learn new songs and add will learn songs at your request. Having this flexibility was really important to us. ASJB have a ton of party and wedding experience so they know what songs to play when through the night. They structured the set list in such a fantastic way and played to the mood of the group. ASJB accomodated us in a huge way - by allowing some of our friends and family to perform during the reception as well. 1\. My sister-in-law performed (vocals/guitar) both our first dance and maid of honor speech. ASJB provided background percussion and worked with her weeks in advance of the wedding. 2\. The band learned new songs at request!! 3\. A few of my friends coordinated with ASJB in advance to get up with the band and perform vocals for a few Bruce Springsteen songs - which turned out to be hilarious and really well done. Our group didn't leave the dance floor the whole night. ASJB had a great time playing for our crew and you can tell they enjoy playing together - I really can't say enough about them. 5 stars, 2 thumbs way up.

For the amount of money these guys charge, we expected a much more personalized set of music. They sent us their play list, and we painstakingly selected and faxed back a selection...

of songs we really liked and wanted at our wedding. However, they wrote back essentially saying we should trust them to 'do what they do best,' which probably meant that they played the same standard set they play at every wedding! In other words, too lazy to take our unique tastes and desires into consideration. We were pretty upset, since they played several songs that were definitely on our NO list or quite frankly inappropriate (we had lots of children in attendance). That being said, the guests all had a good time, oblivious to the kind of party we were TRYING to create. They certainly seemed to enjoy what was played. Also, it's worth mentioning that the sound/video clips advertised on the website did not match the band that got sent out to our event. They also insist on FULL payment about a month before the event, so there is no repercussion for an unsatisfying event.
