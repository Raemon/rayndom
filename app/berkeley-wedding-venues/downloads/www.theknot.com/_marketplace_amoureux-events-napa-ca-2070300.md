We chose Noy after speaking with 3 other planners. She helped me host my daughter's out of town wedding with only 16 weeks of lead time. My friends couldn't believe I was so calm ...

and not nervous at all. I knew I was in the best hands- Noy's hands. She is outstanding at what she does: extremely professional, calm and capable...but sweet and fun too! We are so happy we got to work together. Noy went the extra mile for us. Her fee was less than other planners who only offered a binder and timeline. Immediately, Noy provided help with finding vendors and working with them. We had some last minute issues arise and she found solutions for everything.

We truly cannot say enough amazing things about her. From the very beginning, she provided incredible vendor recommendations and handled every curveball with ease. We went through ...

multiple venue changes and several last-minute adjustments, and she somehow made everything come together seamlessly. She spent countless hours on the phone with us, making sure every detail aligned perfectly with our vision. She exceeded every expectation and ensured nothing was overlooked. On the day of the wedding, we faced last-minute changes and had only a few hours to completely transform the space — and she executed it flawlessly, without a single complaint. The result was nothing short of magical, truly like something out of a fairytale. There is no one else we would have rather worked with. She is spectacular, and we would recommend her to anyone and everyone planning a wedding.

lessly with our venue and vendors (she even knew many of them already). Noy helped us stay calm and organized throughout our intimate 10-person wedding, ensuring everything ran smoothly. She treated our small celebration with the same professionalism as any large event. I highly recommend Noy - she made our wedding day stress-free and perfect.

he was incredibly organized, attentive, and always available for any questions or last-minute changes we had. Her expertise and calm presence gave us so much confidence throughout the entire planning process. One of the biggest advantages was that she’s bilingual in Spanish, which was a huge plus for us since many of our guests and some vendors spoke Spanish. Noy made sure everyone felt comfortable and included, ensuring smooth communication at every step. Her attention to detail, creative ideas, and genuine care for making our vision come to life were beyond impressive. She truly went above and beyond to make sure everything ran flawlessly on the wedding day. If you’re looking for someone who’s reliable, professional, and genuinely passionate about making your wedding the best it can be, we highly recommend Noy!

Noy is simply incredible. Not only is she impressively organized and well versed in the industry, but she has an amazing eye for style. Noy is the first to speak up for you to oth...

er vendors regarding your vision for the big day, whether it be keeping your budget in mind or appearance of things in mind, making everything seamless and easy! On top of it all, she is without a doubt a people person and is the kindest person you’ll ever meet. After my now MIL (mother-of-the-groom) met Noy for the first time, she said “wow how did you find this woman? She is amazing!!!!” And trust me she wouldn’t say that about just anyone. Noy did not make it feel like she was a hired planner but rather someone who’s mission was to execute a stunning wedding for our big day; someone who was overjoyed to go the extra mile and make every little detail perfect. I can’t help but to feel incredibly blessed and lucky to have had Noy plan my dream wedding in Napa. With her by our sides it turned out to be the most unforgettable, beautifully executed day that was stress free. It was most important to have a stress free wedding not only as a bride, but most importantly for my amazing mother who was a little more hands off in the planning because she is a busy accountant. The only thing I wanted was for my mother to not have to stress and just enjoy the weekend and she did just that all thanks to Noy! I could go on and on but just know if you hire Noy you and in the best hands!!!! If I ever need an event in the future planned, she will be the first person I call.

es. That is a tough line to thread and she does it so well! She added so much value during the pre planning and also on day of the wedding. Her team was wonderful during our wedding and we couldn't have had such a smooth experience without her leadership. She has such in depth knowledge of vendors, best practices and how to manage people. We trusted her completely and her commitment to executing a successful wedding was visible in every detail. For example, (at the last minute) she went above and beyond to get a hold of sparklers for us once our vendor couldn't deliver in time. So so so thankful for her partnership!
