The Black Tux, what can I say about this organization that hasn't already been said about any horrible company? I have used The Black Tux's services three times since 2018; why d...

o I keep giving them a chance? Perhaps it is because I want them to stay in business, but they won't for much longer. The most egregious of all incidences happened last week, when I needed a replacement tux ASAP because none of the clothing items in my box fit. Which, for the life of me, I cannot understand why because I was measured by a Black Tux associate at the San Francisco location earlier this year for my own wedding! Regardless, I visited the showroom in Natick, MA on Thursday to speak with a consultant and order replacements. My sizes were confirmed, an apology was given, and replacements were promised to be delivered (I paid $40 to The Black Tux for next day shipping) in time for my event. Big surprise, the pieces did not arrive on time, and I was forced to drive to a nearby shopping mall to buy dress clothes two hours prior to the wedding. The Black Tux refunded me for the rented tuxedo, but refused to pay for the items that I absolutely had to buy for the wedding. The last time I checked, showing up to a black tie wedding in casual attire was frowned upon. This company sucks, period. Spend your hard-earned money elsewhere, perhaps a company where they will work hard to earn and keep your business. A company that deeply cares about their customers, and will stop at no length to make things right.

I was charged four times for a single order through their payment portal. Their response has been unsatisfactory, as they assert that there is nothing they can do, and I will have ...

to wait 5-10 business days for a refund. Waiting 5-10 business days for a $700 refund is highly inconvenient and unacceptable. This feels borderline illegal.

d to me by a friend, who used them for his wedding in New York City. After a stellar Home Try-On (which I encourage you to do, I think you'll be impressed) I decided to use Black Tux for the groomsmen at my wedding as well. Everyone looked great, and the few minor sizing issues that came up on the first shipment were quickly handled and new items were received within a couple of days. I had already purchased my own suit, so it was important that the styles and color matched. I ordered swatches, and found a perfect match. What you see is what you get. Easy process, great styles, and I love that you can see who of your party has submitted their measurements, and who hasn't (in case you need to motivate some of your more slow-moving party to get it done.) Would use them again for my next wedding!

y to get the suits without having to go to a physical location or meet all together. They were delivered right on time, and returning the suit was a breeze (literally pop it in the box and drop it at a FedEx). We were able to do a "try-on" before hand so that we could request custom alterations (i.e., shortened sleeve length, etc.), and the suit came perfectly tailored about 2 weeks before our wedding day. The customer service is fantastic and the suits looked amazing! I would highly recommend this company!

y! My "In Home Try On" (which I highly recommend doing) was completely free and gave me a great idea on how the suit was going to fit the day of my wedding. The only issue out of the entire suit was that the jacket arm was too long by about an inch. I simply called The Black Tux, told them the issue, and when the suit arrived for my wedding, it fit perfectly. Both of my groomsman and the man-of-honor were very impressed with the quality and fit of the suits. Everything about the order, sizing, and resizing were very easy and completely stress free. I don't think I've ever had a suit fit me nearly as well as the one on my wedding day. If I had any complaint at all with The Black Tux, it would be that I could not purchase the suit after the wedding.

The team at Black Tux is awesome - made the process to rent 10 tuxes as easy as it could get! We had 3 different tux styles, people all over the world (in the UK and Canada as well...

as across the states) and they were always there to help on phone or in store. I recommend trying to get into a store to ensure the sizing is perfect; however, even over the phone and using their website is a piece of cake and works well. And they ship you the tuxes 2 weeks in advance - plenty of time to request a smaller size if needed. 5/5 stars - the best rental experience I've had, we won't go back to the stores.

He wasn't sure about the jacket and if he needed smaller so to be safe they sent him a backup, which was perfect and what he ended up wearing. The price was incredible, the customer service was amazing and the guys all look so so good!! He and his groomsmen all had multiple interactions with the Black Tux customer service team and they were always responsive, professional and delivered on their promises. Definitely recommend!

When my husband-to-be still hadn't found a suit he liked for our wedding with barely a month and a half to go, I was more than nervous and needed to find a solution -- fast. After ...

surfing reviews on The Knot, I came across The Black Tux. While I was nervous to order suits from an online company, the positive reviews convinced be to give it a try.... and looking back, I can now say it was one of the best decisions we made for our wedding! It was easy for all groomsmen to order, with step-by-step instructions for submitting their measurements. I contacted customer service twice for assistance in helping a groomsmen, and was impressed with their quick and personal responses! When the suits arrived, I was thrilled with the quality -- much better than the standard suit rental stores in the mall -- and the fit was great! I was also pleased with the look of the tan color. (We order the tan suit with white shirt and brown shoes.) While I had previously told my groom I hated khaki suits, these didn't look too casual, wrinkled or yellow (my main concerns!). Rather, they looked polished, with a truly neutral cast that photographed beautifully. Following the event, the return process was straightforward and easy. Overall, we and our groomsmen had a great experience, and the lack of hassle leading up to and after such a stressful day was much appreciated! I highly recommend to other brides looking for an easy, but high-quality, solution. (And if you're still nervous, you can order suits in advance to check out in person!)

WH is a ripoff). With that said - it definitely wasn't a perfect experience. We had some issues with sizes, availability, etc but they have an all-star team when it comes to remedying their mistakes. They are willing to do whatever they need to in order to make it right for you and I am very happy that I ended up using TBT. The suits looked awesome and our entire wedding party had suits that fit very well compared to the quality of fit you receive from MWH. Highly recommend TBT - take a chance, you won't be disappointed.

finding suits as he is on the shorter side, with a broad build and slim fit at the waist. The suit arrived and fit like a glove! They even accommodated our dads with free trials. A few of the groomsmen's suit didn't fit upon delivery, but everything was quickly taken care of before the wedding. Customer service was always helpful and truly pleasant to deal with. Dropping the suits in the mail was the icing on the cake! I would definitely recommend The Black Tux!

DO NOT use this company. They will send you the wrong order multiple times and then when you try to let them know and use their process for getting items that fit 9 days before yo...

ur event, then they will promise you expedited shipping and then ship the slowest speed possible just to save a buck despite the fact you are probably spending over a grand with them. This is happening to me as we speak and the SUPERVISOR told me that I should just hope the item gets there the day before and that this is standard policy for them despite being told initially it would arrive four days before at a minimum. She promised me they would watch the order and that she believed it would be delivered two days before even though the tracking said one day. Well its the end of the day two days before and no item and no follow up from the company, so that was a lie. My groomsman is having to purchase a tux now because of this company's purposeful incompetence. She (her name is Amelia if anyone else has spoken to her) told me to go ahead and review them because she doesn't care at all that you are spending over $1000 on rented items for a once in a lifetime event. They will blame you and FedEx despite you doing exactly what you were supposed to and FedEx delivering according to the speed they selected. This company is awful and please do not use them, their assurances are worthless because they don't stand behind them and will just make excuses instead of making things right. They are the worst vendor I have ever worked with and despite an hour on hold and on the phone with the supervisor they have zero desire to do anything to actually help.

e wrong suits. He didn't have any time to fix his mistake and I didn't trust them to in the first place, Luckily, my best man had rented a suit from the Black tux for a wedding back in June and he looked great. The issue... It was 3 days before my wedding. Mike at the Black Tux went waaaay above and beyond to help me place an order immediately and ensured that it was shipped in the morning. I looked amazing. My new wife loved the suit and everyone told me how handsome I looked. If the black tux didn't go out of their way for me I would have had constant reminders whenever I looked at my wedding photos. Instead, I see a handsome man in a stylish, sleek suit next to his beaming bride. I cannot thank you enough for saving my special day.

I had a poor experience with The Black Tux and for a bride and groom, it was a lot of added stress right before the Big Day. The online order experience was excellent and the suits...

were good quality, but 3 days before the event we had still not received my husband's suit, when their policy is to send it out 10 days ahead so that the groom receives it 7 days in advance and is able to send it back if there is a fit issue. Some of his groomsmen had received theirs at that point and they all needed to send back at least one piece of the suit, which made us very nervous. Other groomsmen had not yet received theirs either. When I tried to contact The Black Tux, I had a very difficult time. They do not pick up their phone calls, and you are welcomed to be called back by their customer service. However, when they call back and you pick up, there is a voice recording saying "Sorry, we seem to have missed you. Please try us again", or something to that effect. This happened more than three times. I finally got someone on the phone and was told I'd be called back the next day once it was shipped out, after they blamed the issue on FedEx (however, if it was FedEx's shipping issue, I would have at least received a preliminary notification that it was scanned, and secondly, if it was a FedEx issue, you think someone at The Black Tux would have reached out to let us know about it). Anyway, the next day I did not receive a call back, so I again went through the call/hold/auto-recording chase. When I got someone on the phone I demanded a FedEx tracking number for the suit, and that I was not hanging up until it was addressed. I would not recommend this company, especially when trying to outfit a bridal party, as it caused a massive amount of stress and time wasted on the phone. Lastly, their shoes for rent are horribly cheap looking in person - a total dissapointment.

This is a great option, especially for those who are having their wedding in the same location that the tuxedos will be shipped to for the event. We had a nice experience. Almost a...

ll the tuxedos needed alterations, with three needing a different jacket over-nighted to us which was a little stressful as we were going from NY to Baltimore (and others from TX to MD) for the wedding. Almost everyone had alterations made to their tuxedo jackets and pants (although the 2inch band was really useful for everyone, it was really length that was altered for the pants). It was nice that all the accessories were also an option to rent, and it was an easy process to ship everything back. Again, this is a great option and I think with options like Rent the Runway, if you're a pretty standard size and you're going to be in the same location as shipment receipt, then I would definitely recommend. Might be best for a more traditional way to rent if you're going to be out of town though (for sanity's sake).
