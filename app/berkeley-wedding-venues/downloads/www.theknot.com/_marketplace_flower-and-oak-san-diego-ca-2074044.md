our wedding day perfectly. When our photographer unexpectedly didn’t show and sent two random replacements, we were beyond grateful that Frank and Flower & Oak ensured every memory was beautifully documented. The editing was outstanding—we even purchased the add-on services, and it was worth every penny! The final video is cinematic, emotional, and a true reflection of our day. We cannot recommend Frank and Flower & Oak highly enough—they truly went above and beyond to make our wedding unforgettable.

ething that really stood out to me during their pitch is how much they strive to edit tailored to our preferences and styles. Before wedding day, we filled out a very comprehensive form that allowed us to note special areas at our locations, music preferences, and key events. That said, they are also ultimate professionals on the fly. I had completely forgotten to tell the team about one special thing we were doing during our ceremony and it wasn’t until it was happening in the moment that I thought “oh no our walk path is going to mess up the video set up”. I wasn’t even done with my thought to myself when the videographer yanked the camera to allow us to continue on our little surprise walk and still got great footage despite us throwing him a curve ball. The final products are truly stunning, and working with the team was one of our best vendor experiences of the day. Thank you flower + oak!

From the first phone call until the very end, Mark was very professional and accommodating. The communication throughout the whole process was great from both Mark and Carrie. Brandon was our videographer for the day of the wedding. He was very professional and had a great eye for detail. Once our videos were ready, I emailed Mark and asked him to change one song and to add a reading. He replied right away and delivered exactly what we wanted. The final product turned out great! We absolutely loved our videos and the turnaround time was very reasonable. The best part is that we got all the raw footage from our special day. We are very satisfied with the whole team and would definitely recommend them.
