Unique | Creative | Fun | Eco-Friendly




## Unique Wedding Send-Offs

Don't let your wedding send-off be an afterthought. Check out these unique wedding exits that you'll definitely want to steal. 

### 1\. Sky Lantern Grand Exit Wedding Idea




![Sky lantern wedding exit](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/b713fc1f-b861-42e7-8227-faa4435befc0~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1242.932)

This wedding send-off idea is best for couples planning to end their reception as the sun sets or even later so you can feel the magic in the experience. Paper lanterns look gorgeous in the sky and beautiful in photos too. Some people believe sky lantern ceremonies bring good luck and new beginnings because, traditionally, people attach notes of prayers, blessings or requests to the lanterns. The purpose of this ritual is for the lanterns to float to the heavens so the gods can receive the releasers' wishes and make them come true. So before releasing your paper lanterns into the night sky, consider having everyone write marriage well-wishes on them at some point during the wedding reception.

FEATURED VIDEO FROM THE KNOT

Want a more sustainable option? Put the lanterns on strings or ask your guests to hold them instead of releasing them into the air. This way the sky lanterns don't become a litter problem later.

**The Knot Expert Tip:** Traditionally, the sky lanterns are lit at the bottom by a match or lighter so they can float off into the sky. Since having an open flame is a fire hazard, consider having a shuttle take you and your guests to an open field to do the ritual or using lightweight battery-operated tealight candles.

### 2\. Smoke Bomb Send-Off Idea for Weddings




![Smoke bomb wedding exit](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/f3fb2a6a-7ac5-4396-a925-a4d8d2b84f7b~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1242.932)

A smoke show is a fun daytime wedding send-off idea that'll make you and your partner look like rock stars. You can give your guests portable smoke bombs or ask a professional to do the task. Pose with your wedding guests or wedding party for epic pictures, or drive through the colorful haze in your [getaway car](https://www.theknot.com/content/the-getaway-car).

Things to keep in mind when using smoke bombs: First, get your wedding venue's permission and only use smoke bombs outside. Second, smoke bombs can stain clothes, so warn your guests about this possibility before the event. Finally, tell your wedding photographer about your smoke bomb idea so they can prepare in advance.

### 3\. Mini Beach Ball Wedding Exit Idea 




![Mini beach ball wedding exit](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/e06a3f26-699f-4b70-ad9e-c91cfbf59fa8~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1242.932)

Planning a [beach wedding](https://www.theknot.com/content/beach-wedding-tips)? Then, use this wedding exit toss idea for your event. Regardless of your locale, you can get in vacation or [destination wedding](https://www.theknot.com/content/best-destination-wedding-locations) mode by tossing mini beach balls. You and your wedding party will have to inflate each beach ball, but we promise you it'll be worth it.

### 4\. Sword Grand Exit Wedding Idea 




![Sword wedding exit](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/1c692b2a-99f2-4358-a0c1-6b77cdb11be0~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1344.1008)

_Photo: Christina Karst_

Are you or your partner in the [military](https://www.theknot.com/content/military-wedding-ceremony-and-reception)? Consider doing a saber arch (or arch of sabers ceremony) as a no-mess wedding send-off idea. A saber arch is a military wedding tradition where swords or sabers are used to salute the newlyweds during their ceremony exit.

### 5\. DIY Flag Send-Off Idea for a Wedding




![DIY flag wedding send-off](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/06661f9b-291e-45d9-b17e-c4a6bf2db88d~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1101.1468)

_Photo: Amy Rae Photography_

This is just one of our flag send-off options. Give your guests small flags with celebratory statements, like "hooray," "cheers" and "congrats," to wave as you leave your ceremony and to take home after the party.

### 6\. Tinsel Streamer Wedding Exit Idea




![Tinsel streamer wedding exit](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/b61c46d6-05fd-4896-87cc-12e47b878403~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1340.1005)

_Photo: Lightly Photography_

Nothing says "party time" quite like streamer cannons. For a more _stream_ lined wedding send-off idea, stick to your wedding colors or a cohesive (for example, all silver, pink or blue, etc.) assortment.

### 7\. Bubble Shooter Grand Wedding Exit Idea




![Bubble shooter wedding exit](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/8067ea7c-6d57-4638-adac-14de6d3ba1d5~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1340.1005)

_Photo: Glorious Moments Photography_

People don't tell you this, but manually blowing bubbles takes a lot out of you, so give your wedding guests' lungs a break by handing out bubble shooters before your wedding exit. Using bubble shooters is a great photo op because your wedding photographer can capture you surrounded by more bubbles resulting in a better picture.

### 8\. Paper Fan Wedding Send-Off Idea

![Custom Camp Wedding Ceremony Fans](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/7b1af817-0054-4b53-8944-d33b5faeb0b4~rs_768.h-cr_0.67.800.1134)

_[Photo: Heather Curiel](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/heather-curiel-austin-tx-385857)_

For warm-weather weddings, paper fans are both practical and pretty. Personalize the fans with your names, wedding date or monogram, and pass them out for guests to wave during your ceremony or reception exit. Not only will they add a celebratory flutter to your photos, but they'll double as keepsakes your guests can take home, too.

### 9\. Party Horns Wedding Send-Off Idea

![a couple celebrating with a party horn](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/9c6c3136-d9d2-4d45-b00e-da19a6e8ac35~rs_768.h-cr_387.0.1448.1414)

_Photo: Getty Images_

If you want to lean into a joyful, celebratory mood, hand out mini party horns or celebratory blowers for guests to use as you exit. They'll create a cheerful soundtrack to accompany your walk out and are especially fitting for lively receptions full of music and dancing.

### 10\. Hurley Stick Send-Off for a Wedding




![Hurley stick wedding send-off](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/e457200e-e902-46d1-8f26-3df2371ba2e0~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1340.1005)

_Photo: Emily Wren Photography_

Play into your or your partner's heritage for your wedding exit. At this real wedding, the couple exited the ceremony under hurley sticks, used in the Irish game of hurling, to honor the groom's [Irish background](https://www.theknot.com/content/irish-wedding-traditions).

### Find your kind of venue

From barns to ballrooms, discover reception venues that feel like you.

### 11\. Butterfly Wedding Exit Idea




![Butterfly wedding exit](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/10817678-eed1-4c4c-9cdb-873552aca5f6~rs_768.h-cr_0.34.1029.1406)

_Photo: Stephanie Brazzle Photography_

Butterflies represent new beginnings, making them an obvious choice for a cute wedding send-off idea. Doing a butterfly release is up for debate since there are questions about whether it's humane. We suggest researching butterfly releases and finding out which companies put the safety of the butterflies first. Another option is to give your guests paper butterflies to toss in the air during your exit.

### 12\. Snow Machine Wedding Exit Idea

![Groom in Tuxedo Kisses Bride in Formal Coat, Guests Throw Petals in Snow](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/a72cf90a-d2d0-4b7f-9377-debe9871fe3b~rs_768.h-cr_82.0.1375.970)

_[Photo: Brie Thomason Photography](https://briethomason.com/)_

If you're planning a winter wedding, a snow machine can create a magical winter-wonderland effect for your grand finale. Since the snow dissolves quickly, it won't leave a big mess behind and looks stunning under twinkle lights or a starry sky.

### 13\. Champagne Shower Grand Wedding Exit Idea




![Champagne shower wedding send-off](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/e9af4da5-4069-4adf-b578-acfd752cc779~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1076.807)

_Photo: Carley K Photography_

What's one thing you'll most likely already be buying a lot of? Champagne! Use bottles of bubbly to celebrate your wedding exit, but be cautious of flying corks and slippery walkways.

## Creative Wedding Send-Offs

There are a lot of ways you can go about your wedding exit, but that doesn't mean it has to be complicated. Here are creative ideas that are easy to execute, and some of them are free. 

### 14\. Paper Airplane Send-Off Wedding Idea




![Paper airplane wedding exit](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/76cfae85-f48d-4dec-abfd-55ba84975de6~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1000.750)

_Photo: SO Photography_

Wondering what to throw at a wedding? Get your wedding party together and start folding to create these playful well-wishes for your exit. Or outsource the work. Consider personalizable paper airplanes (with your and your partner's names or wedding colors) or paper airplane seating cards you can later repurpose for the exit.

### 15\. Maracas Wedding Exit Idea




![Maracas wedding send-off](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/bdbef7d1-5e40-494b-add2-ea377e340cd0~rs_768.h-cr_133.0.2266.1600)

_Photo: Alicia Lucia Photography_

Add music to your special day with this fun send-off wedding idea. Personalize the maracas by adding your and your partner's names and painting them your wedding colors. Maracas can double as a unique [wedding favor](https://www.theknot.com/content/best-wedding-favor-ideas) too.

### 16\. Cheer Pom Pom Grand Exit Wedding Idea




![Cheer pom pom wedding exit](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/fc5f023d-db82-4169-b3a0-4adb0d7b4a5f~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1076.807)

_Photo: Eclectic Images_

Encourage nostalgia and show your spirit by handing out cheer pom poms in your school, sports team or wedding colors. There's nothing like running down a tunnel of pom poms to get you excited about your new life with your spouse.

### 17\. Lightsaber Wedding Send-Off Idea




![Lightsaber wedding exit](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/fc029cff-0143-4393-9779-4e0f5cae308e~rs_768.h-cr_0.100.1200.1700)

_Photo: Nick and Lauren Photography_

If you're a massive "[Star Wars](https://www.theknot.com/content/star-wars-wedding-ideas)" fan, having this cool wedding send-off idea is an absolute must. Give your guests lightsabers at the end of the wedding ceremony or reception and have them line up on either side of you and your partner. The sabers create a colorful and dramatic tunnel for you and your partner to walk down and will make a memory you'll never forget.

### 18\. Foam Glow Stick Wedding Exit Idea




![Foam glow stick wedding send-off](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/e61ab9b2-89af-4dd5-a8bc-be8ddc78a72d~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1076.807)

_Photo: Angela Sue Photography_

Foam glow sticks are a creative mixture of the lightsaber and regular glow stick wedding send-off ideas. Foam glow sticks are bigger so they can show up better on camera, are customizable, and many online sellers offer foam glow sticks that flash multiple colors.

### 19\. Tambourine Wedding Send-Off Idea




![Tambourine wedding exit](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/2dff68b5-9ea1-46fb-a841-573ef535cdfb~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1076.807)

_Photo: Emma Cleary Photo & Video_

Another way you can add music to your wedding exit is by giving your guests tambourines. This happy couple is using lace tambourines, so feel free to get as creative as you'd like with the instrument's design.

### 20\. Pom Pom Wands Grand Exit Wedding Idea




![Pom pom wands wedding exit](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/f457cfcf-f9b1-49e5-b776-e83e69cbf2ad~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1076.807)

_Photo: Maura Jane Photography_

A crafty staple, pom poms are inexpensive and colorful, plus a festive (and soft) little something for guests to throw. (Be sure to assign someone to clean up the mess after.) We like mini pom poms that come in numerous color options so they can perfectly coordinate with your palette. But pom pom confetti poppers are also super-cute.

### 21\. Bell Wedding Exit Idea




![Bell wedding exit](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/0c83b124-5fcb-4a47-a69b-bcf53ff0aacc~rs_768.h-cr_55.0.944.667)

Want to skip any after-wedding exit mess altogether? Then use this indoor wedding send-off idea and give your guests small bells (or cowbells for [rustic](https://www.theknot.com/content/rustic-wedding-ideas) or [country weddings](https://www.theknot.com/content/country-wedding-ideas)) for them to ring. Decorate them or tassels, ribbons or stickers to add a personal touch.

### 22\. Dove Balloon Send-Off Idea for Weddings




![Dove balloon wedding send-off](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/381170e9-feb2-4afe-b3fe-f82e7581f9e9~rs_768.h-cr_111.0.1888.1333)

_Photo: Charley Smith Photography_

Many believe a dove release is inhumane, so that's why people have found using dove balloons as a good alternative. You get the same symbolization of love and peace without using a live flock.

### 23\. Cell Phone Grand Exit Wedding Idea




![Cell phone wedding exit](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/f05cb0b3-e2cd-40bf-b1c2-220a7557d3d1~rs_768.h-cr_133.0.2266.1600)

_Photo: Nicole Hernandez_

Unless you're planning an [unplugged wedding](https://www.theknot.com/content/unplugged-wedding-pros-and-cons), your guests will probably already have their cell phones out so they can snap pictures of your special day. Use that to your advantage. Ask your guests to take out their phones so they can light your way down the ceremony or reception exit. Do this wedding send-off idea at night so your photographer can better capture the magic. 

### 24\. Napkin Wedding Exit Idea




![Napkin wedding exit](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/e1e5f978-a44b-4f02-b713-cdbe23a8d52c~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1076.807)

_Photo: 5th Avenue Digital_

Monogram napkins or hankies—or ask your loved ones to bring some from your favorite establishments—and have your guests whip them around at the end of your ceremony or reception. We like fabric ones because you can bring them home and reuse them, but personalized paper ones work too.

## Fun Wedding Send-Offs

These are some of the best wedding send-off ideas that are sure to delight guests of all ages. End your ceremony or reception the right way with one of these fun options. 

### 25\. Fireworks Grand Exit Wedding Idea




![Firework wedding exit ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/67c0e333-3458-4de9-919d-045fad1dd9e3~rs_768.h-cr_0.59.882.1235)

_Photo: SMS Photography_

Ending your wedding with a firework display is one of the best nighttime wedding send-off ideas for a grand and spectacular exit. You can even ask the firework staff if the show can have your and your partner's names written in it or, something a little simpler, your wedding colors. Of course, since fireworks can be a fire hazard, ask your wedding venue if it's okay to have fireworks on the property.

### 26\. Sparkler Send-Off Idea for a Wedding




![Sparkler wedding send-off ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/73c99fa7-5229-4cec-8f8b-a076c69014e3~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1398.1049)

_Photo: Katie Childs Photo_

A shimmering canopy of mesmerizing sparklers makes for the perfect photo op. But before you start buying sparklers, don't forget to ensure sparkler send-offs are allowed at your venue and meet all fire ordinance requirements. You want sparklers marketed as safe for weddings, long in length _and_ long-lasting.

### 27\. Glitter and Confetti Wedding Exit Idea




![Glitter and confetti wedding exit ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/99f4d9b3-a003-41ea-b24c-aa9fed46ec0d~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1398.1049)

_Photo: Steven Michael Photography_

Combine the best of both worlds and have your guests throw glitter and confetti for your wedding send-off. Ensure you get large-size glitter versus having "normal" glitter so it shows up better in your wedding photos. (It also helps make the clean-up process quicker and easier.) Warning: It might take you and your partner some time to get all the confetti and glitter off after this wedding exit idea since they easily stick to hair and skin.

### 28\. Cold Sparkler Machine Grand Wedding Exit Idea




![Cold sparkler machine wedding exit](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/fa8229b3-3bcd-41f8-8ee0-60042486f52b~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1398.1049)

_Photo: Tamara Gruner Photography_

One alternative to sparkler send-off is renting cold sparkler machines. This wedding exit idea is a safer option if giving fire to guests who've had too much to drink sounds like a bad idea.

### 29\. Confetti Send-Off Idea for a Wedding




![Confetti wedding send-off](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/02842ea5-7e37-44fc-a5ec-15b0f34e5c59~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1398.1049)

_Photo: READYLUCK_

If you go the confetti route, we recommend biodegradable confetti for an eco-friendly wedding exit toss idea. Avoid seed paper confetti—your venue won't be happy if unexpected blooms sprout on their lawn. Luckily, there are other options on the market, like heart-shaped paper cutouts because there's no better way to close out the grand display of your love than with the ultimate symbol of romance.

### 30\. Balloon Wedding Exit Idea




![Balloon wedding exit](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/43d62ffe-c159-4177-8acf-f22fed6e3bac~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1398.1049)

_Photo: K and K Photography_

A balloon toss is a great indoor wedding send-off idea. Have fun with this rice toss alternative by picking colors or patterns that match your wedding theme and colors.

### 31\. Sequin Toss Wedding Send-Off Idea

![large sequins](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/cf7d968f-e5d0-435b-ba53-5ec368c67225~rs_768.h-cr_1061.0.2122.1414)

_Photo: Getty Images_

Add sparkle to your farewell moment with an oversized sequin toss. Choose larger, easy-to-clean sequins in metallic shades like gold, rose gold or silver to complement your décor. They'll shimmer beautifully in the light and add a seriously glamorous touch to your newlywed exit.

### 32\. Flower Tunnel Wedding Exit Idea

![a bride and bridesmaids holding flowers](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/1401773b-3711-4ffd-b073-57ade6f54417~rs_768.h-cr_82.0.1375.970)

_[Photo: Amative Creative](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/amative-creative-lynchburg-va-660977)_

Instead of tossing something into the air, ask your wedding party or guests to hold floral garlands to form a tunnel. You and your partner can walk beneath a canopy of blooms for a romantic, garden-inspired send-off moment. Garlands made from eucalyptus, roses or wildflowers all work beautifully, and will look amazing in photos as well. 

### 33\. Starry Toss Wedding Send-Off Idea

![a person holding star confetti](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/e968056d-30ef-4dc4-aed1-f8180bf5c5a9~rs_768.h-cr_0.118.1414.2003)

_Photo: Getty Images_

Have your guests toss star-shaped confetti in the air as you make your exit for a dreamy wedding send-off. Choose stars in metallic or iridescent finishes to catch the light and tie into a night-sky or romantic theme. 

### 34\. Second Line Grand Wedding Exit Idea




![Second line wedding exit](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/6aa50eb3-7a17-4bf4-ad37-091d12c6dd1b~rs_768.h-cr_90.0.1530.1080)

_Photo: Emma Cleary Photo & Video_

Plan a second line or [New Orleans wedding parade](https://www.theknot.com/content/5-things-you-need-for-the-perfect-new-orleans-wedding-parade) for your wedding exit. This parade can lead you and your guests from your ceremony to your reception venue or be the last hurrah after the reception festivities.

### 35\. Flag Wedding Exit Idea




![Flag wedding exit](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/d35fd10b-66c3-4548-85a9-219ab56a6d51~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1398.1049)

_Photo: Once Like A Spark Photo + Video_

Want to incorporate your and your partner's backgrounds in your [multicultural wedding](https://www.theknot.com/content/multicultural-wedding-tips)? Then, give your guests country flags representing your and your partner's origins. The flags can work as place settings before the send-off too.

If a sparkler exit is off-limits at your wedding venue, a glow stick wedding exit can still end the night on a bright note. The glow sticks work as a fun transition to hype everybody up for the [wedding after-party](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-reception-after-party-basics). (The classic wearable glow sticks work great for this occasion.)

Delicate lavender buds offer a hint of fragrance (which creates a unique [scentscaping](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-to-scent-wedding) experience), but they're a great choice for romantic or pastel color palettes. You can find premade lavender wedding toss tubes or prefilled sachets that double as beautiful escort card holders. Or, buy the buds in bulk, then let guests scoop them into the vessel of your choice.

### 39\. Sprinkles Wedding Exit Idea

One of the sweetest ideas is to give guests sprinkles to toss. (Yes, we mean your favorite ice cream topping.) Buy them in bulk by the pound and put them in personalized baggies.

### 40\. Rose Petal Grand Wedding Exit Idea




![Rose petal wedding exit](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/fe98045f-f454-4f79-8ebb-0a11aa2e1360~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1398.1049)

_Photo: Meghann Champan Photography_

Rose petals have always been a top wedding send-off idea. Consider adding different colored blooms to elevate the moment even more. Buy fancy prefilled sachets or a bulk supply of durable freeze-dried roses, or speak with your wedding florist about getting fresh petals for the exit toss. Another option is faux flower petals, which are best for indoor ceremony exits because they can be easily swept up.

### 41\. Dried Eucalyptus Wedding Send-Off Idea

If you want to emphasize your natural wedding theme, use this creative wedding exit toss idea. Eucalyptus lends to a quicker cleaning process and is sustainable for the planet.

### 42\. Human Tunnel Wedding Exit Idea

Get ready to duck as you hold hands with your new spouse while running down a human tunnel. The best part about this wedding send-off idea is simple and doesn't require any supplies.

### 43\. Bubbles Send-Off Idea for a Wedding




![Bubbles send-off](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/4020fbf6-07ff-489d-a997-5215c477e0e4~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1056.792)

Bubbles are a ceremony or reception exit idea you don't have to sweep up afterward—score! Personalized mini bubble bottles can also act as favors. Bubbles will bring some childlike wonder to your wedding send-off.

### 44\. Birdseed Grand Exit Wedding Idea




![Birdseed wedding send-off idea](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/5d5d7d11-c4f0-45d3-bf8c-351530727ce6~rs_768.h-cr_0.26.774.1058)

Birds will thank you for doing this eco-friendly wedding send-off. You can put the birdseed in cups or cones like what's shown above. We suggest doing this alternative to throwing rice earlier in the day while the birds are still out to snack, which inevitably helps with cleanup.

### 45\. Ribbon Streamer Stick Grand Exit Wedding Idea

For colorful wedding send-off ideas that are completely mess-free, ribbon streamer sticks are a fun choice. Attach flowing ribbons to lightweight sticks in your wedding colors so your guests can wave them high as you make your exit. They create beautiful movement in photos and work especially well for garden or boho-style weddings.

### 46\. Leaf Wedding Send-Off Idea




![Leaf wedding send-off ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/e3fa174b-35af-43cd-a5f4-63b0cc8a3008~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1080.1440)

One of the best things about autumn is the beautiful leaves it brings. If you're having a [fall wedding](https://www.theknot.com/content/fall-wedding-ideas), gather up leaves (we love a free exit toss idea) so your guests can shower you with breathtaking fall colors. Ensure the leaves are dry because it makes them easier to toss when the time comes.

### 47\. Rice Grand Wedding Exit Idea




![Rice wedding exit](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/532857ea-294e-4f31-bcd1-07a5d8c696ad~rs_768.h-cr_0.111.1333.1888)

Last but not least, you can always fall back on the tried-and-true rice toss wedding tradition. White rice is an affordable and widely available option for any wedding—again, just make sure your venue allows it. Some online sellers even offer adorable little bags filled with flecks of colored rice, which will set you apart from the pack.

### 48\. Colorful Handkerchief Wave Wedding Send-Off Idea

![Wedding Handkerchief Station](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/6f1cc8b5-79be-4ae1-9ef3-4a462268e5b5~rs_768.h-cr_0.121.1458.2065)

Give guests colorful or monogrammed handkerchiefs to wave joyfully as you depart your ceremony or reception. The swirling fabric creates lots of movement and excitement in photos. Plus, they're reusable, eco-friendly and can even be saved as meaningful keepsakes long after the big day.

### 49\. Dried Jasmine Wedding Exit Idea




![Dried jasmine wedding send-off idea](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/8396a759-a748-4e71-99b2-a81d612382fc~rs_768.h-cr_0.17.1080.1457)
