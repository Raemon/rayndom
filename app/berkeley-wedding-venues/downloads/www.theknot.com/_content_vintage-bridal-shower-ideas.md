Now that you're planning your wedding, why not have a vintage bridal shower with all the bells and whistles? Sure, there are many [bridal shower themes](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-shower-themes) to think about, but "vintage" encompasses a wide range of times, and we have no doubt your favorite will be on this list. Plus, your own love story is undoubtedly worth the fanfare. We've gathered everything you need, including vintage wedding shower decorations, real wedding shower inspiration and more. As the great Jane Austen once said, "There are as many forms of love as there are moments in time." So let's take a look at some moments in time you can create for your bridal bash.

**In this article:** Vintage Bridal Shower Themes | Invitations | Ideas

## Vintage Bridal Shower Themes

Knowing you want a vintage-themed bridal shower doesn't mean you have it all figured out just yet. And with seemingly endless options, where to start? Here are some of our favorite bridal shower styles to evoke days past.

### 1\. Baroque Royalty Wedding Shower

![Baroque Royalty Wedding Shower](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/d0e1d3ca-aec7-47df-9880-56818e4d35c5~rs_768.h-cr_0.176.1458.2120)

Baroque style blends a mix of grandeur, movement and detail for a vintage theme that's undeniable. Inject artistic elements, specifically those that focus on opulence and rich textures, for a royal design that evokes a bygone era with a certain je ne sais quoi.

### 2\. Bride & Prejudice Bridal Shower

![Bride & Prejudice Bridal Shower](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/3360635b-d0f3-463a-be82-e65446f9026d~rs_768.h-cr_0.168.1458.2112)

_[Photography: Kapsule Co.](https://www.kapsuleco.com/),__Florist: The Flower by Yoori_

Jane Austen's novels occurred at the turn of the 19th century in the Georgian era, when Rococo style and the ultimate, broody "single man in possession of a good fortune," aka Mr. Darcy, reigned supreme. For a Bride and Prejudice shower, think grand balls, romantic florals, ornate decor and ribbons and bows. 

### 3\. Cottagecore Vintage Bridal Shower

![Cottagecore Vintage Bridal Shower](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/3e2ac9cf-674c-415d-9b2f-9b90d7f140b2~rs_768.h-cr_82.0.1377.971)

_[Photography: Robert Carlo | New York](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/robert-carlo-%7C-new-york-brooklyn-ny-581470)_

Though cottagecore is more of a modern term, its aesthetic pulls from cozy fairy tales and the English countryside. Some fun ideas for this theme include an arts and crafts station, book bridal shower favors, quaint trinkets as decor and wildflower centerpieces.

### 4\. Gothic Romance and Literature Wedding Shower

![Gothic Romance and Literature Wedding Shower](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/7bdd418f-a22c-4422-9aa3-41d20d1acb33~rs_768.h-cr_81.0.1377.972)

_[Photography: Beck Photo Co](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/beck-photo-co-cleveland-oh-2024479),__[Florist: Plantscaping & Blooms](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/plantscaping-and-blooms-cleveland-oh-374607)_

Mary Shelley practically paved the way for the gothic genre, and this vintage style is full of moody and rich hues with a touch of angst. Turn your venue into your favorite gothic novel with bookish decor, blood-red blooms and maybe a spooky accent here and there.

### 5\. Tea with the Bride-to-Be Bridal Shower

![Tea with the Bride-to-Be Bridal Shower](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/5e20fb29-d0b7-4167-8c96-e6df7f075595~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1457.1943)

Nothing beats a classic tea party, and you can easily fit this theme with any number of vintage styles, like _Alice in Wonderland_ or a royal brunch. Gather your finest china, your favorite teas and an assortment of bite-sized treats to go along with this versatile shower theme.

### 6\. Old Hollywood Glamour Wedding Shower

![Old Hollywood Glamour Wedding Shower](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/c651e807-9525-48fc-a3ee-0affddc960d5~rs_768.h-cr_81.0.1377.972)

_[Photography: Elvira Kalviste Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/elvira-kalviste-photography-sleepy-hollow-ny-665903)_

One of the later vintage eras on this list, old Hollywood, will have you stepping in the shoes of icons like Audrey Hepburn or Gregory Peck. Think old-school glitz and glamour for this party, with elements such as pearls, velvet and diamonds (a girl's best friend, after all).

### 7\. La Vie en Rose Bridal Shower

![La Vie en Rose Bridal Shower](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/37cf09e8-515d-470a-9b15-e7efdc454f36~rs_768.h-cr_0.122.1458.2066)

_[Photography: Morgan Taylor Artistry](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/morgan-taylor-artistry-philadelphia-pa-2020179),__[Bakery: Crust Vegan Bakery](https://www.crustveganbakery.com/)_

One antique-themed bridal shower that lets you be creative is this French-inspired choice. Édith Piaf's iconic song, "La Vie en Rose," means "life in pink," the perfect theme for the blushing bride. Add your favorite French elements into the decor and menu with rosy hues, and voilà, a unique party.

### 8\. Gatsby's Roaring '20s Bridal Shower

![Gatsby's Roaring '20s Bridal Shower](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/9684395d-a500-44fb-8304-7182b9cd6d16~rs_768.h-cr_0.122.1458.2066)

_Photography: Dee Myers Photography,__Stationery: Plume and Paper_

Gatsby sure knew how to throw a party, and the roaring '20s were all about bold colors and geometric shapes. Add some art deco to your decor in classic gold and black, along with swing jazz and flapper girl dresses.

### 9\. Italian Renaissance Bridal Shower

![Italian Renaissance Bridal Shower](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/3ee143e5-5ee5-4fb9-97d2-477ce93ffe77~rs_768.h-cr_0.164.1458.2108)

_[Photography: Love Folio Photography](https://lovefolio.biz/),__[Florist: Stiatti Fiori](https://stiattifiori.it/)_

A vintage [Italian-themed bridal shower](https://www.theknot.com/content/italian-themed-bridal-shower) focused on the Renaissance? That's amore. The ages of da Vinci and Michelangelo place art and architecture at the forefront, so the sky's the limit for this romantic theme that pulls from Italy's rich history.

### 10\. Elegant Garden Party Shower

![Elegant Garden Party Shower](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/0a9c879b-fdae-474f-bac5-701e1027f4d6~rs_768.h-cr_81.0.1377.972)

Add some whimsy to your prewedding event with a floral garden party. French nobility introduced the concept of a fete champetre in the late 17th century, but you can pull elements from any vintage era to create a stunning and unforgettable party.

### 11\. Regency-Era Vintage Wedding Shower

![Regency-Era Vintage Wedding Shower](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/a59a1f77-8685-4c19-9cd5-2fc85d7d8042~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.728.971)

If classical arrangements of modern songs are your thing, then how about a [_Bridgerton_ -themed bridal shower](https://www.theknot.com/content/tea-party-bridal-shower-theme)? Immerse you and your guests in the Regency era with a blend of current-day elements (like glam makeup, fun fabrics and a playlist of string quartets) with the antique aesthetic of an empire waistline ball gown.

### 12\. Love Letters and Postcards Bridal Shower

![Love Letters and Postcards Bridal Shower](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/f7e9a6c9-14cb-40f9-b544-cb7337a43726~rs_768.h-cr_0.168.1458.2112)

_[Photography: Tara Beth Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/tara-beth-photography-philadelphia-pa-606581)_

There's just something ultra-romantic about the days of love letters and postcards, sending correspondence around the world to your love. Nab inspiration from your favorite vintage mail for a one-of-a-kind theme, especially if your family has some old postcards to display.

### 13\. Artful Belle Époque Bridal Shower

![Artful Belle Époque Bridal Shower](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/ba24d169-afc9-4458-8741-59a3637f8e4a~rs_768.h-cr_0.145.1080.1585)

Notable artists like van Gogh, Monet and Picasso gained popularity during the Belle Époque era, often known as the "golden age of France." And since this era blends into the Gilded Age, pull from your favorite elements of both for an art nouveau meets impressionist art style that sends you back through time.
