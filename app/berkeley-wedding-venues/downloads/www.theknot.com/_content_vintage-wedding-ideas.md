From [blurry black and white photography](https://www.theknot.com/content/blurry-wedding-photos-trend) to heavily-decorated cakes and throwback wedding accessories (like gloves), the vintage wedding theme is definitely having a moment. And while there are a lot of different ways to interpret the vintage wedding aesthetic, the latest version of the trend is reminiscent of the ultra-classic, formal weddings that dominated the '80s and '90s.

## What Is a Vintage-Style Wedding?

A vintage wedding is a themed wedding that draws inspiration from past decades and eras. Examples of vintage-inspired wedding themes include a _Great Gatsby_ or Art Deco theme, a 1940s Old Hollywood glamour theme or a 1970s [disco wedding theme](https://www.theknot.com/content/disco-ball-wedding). 

Like most wedding themes, the vintage wedding aesthetic has transformed and changed to fit with other trends over time. In the 2010s, vintage wedding style often referenced a romantic, Old World-inspired look with pastel color palettes, antique candlesticks, velvet chairs and gauzy table linens. Rustic vintage style was another popular iteration, focusing on mismatched, quirky details that created a shabby chic look. 

FEATURED VIDEO FROM THE KNOT

The latest version of vintage wedding style pulls inspiration from the 1980s, '90s and early 2000s—think _Father of the Bride_ , _My Best Friend's Wedding_ and the flashback wedding scenes from _The Parent Trap_. For more inspiration, you might even turn to your parents' or grandparents' weddings, finding details like puff-sleeve wedding gowns, [ice sculptures](https://www.theknot.com/content/ice-sculptures-wedding), live music and wedding cake tiers stacked precariously on top of miniature pillars. And while you don't need to copy those vintage wedding ideas verbatim, they're a great starting point for dreaming up your own version of the style.

## Ideal Vintage Wedding Venue Considerations

[Vintage wedding venues](https://www.theknot.com/content/vintage-wedding-venues) are somewhat traditional—you want to think of the places that most people would have been married in 20, 30 or 40 years ago. That includes churches and houses of worship, historical mansions, banquet halls or hotel ballrooms. At-home weddings, restaurants and parks or gardens are a few other [wedding venue](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace) options that would complement the vintage aesthetic. 

[Find Your Vintage Wedding Venue](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/wedding-reception-venues)

## Vintage Wedding Budget Priorities

When you're allocating your [wedding budget](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-budget-ways-to-save-money), fashion is one major detail that will affect the overall vintage theme. There's no denying that modern-day fashion (wedding attire or not) is easy to spot when compared to fashion from decades past, so you'll want to dedicate a good portion of your budget to finding pieces that make sense for the theme. You can opt for vintage-inspired designs that are still in style today, like a silk taffeta wedding gown with a full skirt or a basic black tuxedo. Even better: Shop vintage fashion archives for your wedding day to get the most authentic look (keep in mind that you can always customize or resize items to fit with a good tailor). 

On their own, flower arrangements, table linens, rental items and stationery may seem like little details, but they're impactful altogether, so working with a [wedding planner](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/wedding-planners) who can help you nail the vintage wedding decor is another budget priority. The same goes for your [wedding venue](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/wedding-reception-venues), which sets the initial vibe and backdrop for the whole celebration. Finally, look for a [wedding photographer](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/wedding-photographers) who specializes in film photography or vintage-style portraits. And remember that you can get pricing estimates for vendors using [The Knot Budget Advisor](https://www.theknot.com/wedding-budget). 

### Find your kind of venue

From barns to ballrooms, discover reception venues that feel like you.

## Vintage Wedding Colors

[Wedding colors](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-color-inspiration-boards) play a huge part in bringing your theme to life, so this is one step you want to think about carefully. Vintage weddings often feature soft, muted colors or classic hues depending on the era. Pastel shades were popular in the 1950s, while the '80s and '90s were a little more opulent, pairing silver and gold with ivory and black as the base colors. Here are a few options to consider when you're [choosing your vintage wedding colors](https://www.theknot.com/content/weddings-with-color). 

### 1\. Black and White

![Bride getting her makeup done](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/abf83d95-b3de-44ed-90c3-7498caa9d13c~rs_768.h-cr_0.321.3000.4321)

_[Photo: Weddings by Nato](https://www.theknot.com/real-weddings/black-and-white-photo-of-bride-getting-lip-color-applied-before-whimsical-wedding-photo)_

This vintage wedding color palette needs no explanation. Whether you incorporate black and white photography, a checkerboard dance floor or outfit the groomsmen in black and white tuxes, it's hard to go wrong with this sophisticated pairing. 

### 2\. Green

![White flowers and green leaves](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/3a400e65-eeb0-493b-a49c-60810c213bd9~rs_768.h-cr_0.33.2048.2764)

_[Photo: Laura Ivanova Photography](https://www.theknot.com/real-weddings/white-and-green-hydrangea-centerpiece-photo)_

Green is another vintage wedding color, especially when it's added through natural elements, like flowers or foliage. Add ivory and gold as the accent colors for a gorgeous palette.

### 3\. Silver and Gold

![Server holding champagne](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/57489d2f-ec2d-443c-951c-66c408a2ac85~rs_768.h-cr_0.7.600.807)

_Photo: Lauren Peele_

Don't fall for the myth that you can't pair silver and gold together—they actually make a great pair, especially for formal weddings. Focus on using classic pieces in metallic tones, like bronze candlesticks and silver serving trays. 

### 4\. Light Pink

![Gold Chivari with pink ribbon](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/e6a6e441-afe8-4194-8632-405faa0671c3~rs_768.h-cr_0.197.1333.1974)

_[Photo: Love Tree Studios](https://www.theknot.com/real-weddings/gold-chiavari-chairs-with-blush-sash-ties-photo)_

Light pink adds romance and charm to a vintage wedding aesthetic. It's subtle enough that you can weave it into a lot of different details (flower arrangements, table linens, stationery, fashion) without worrying about the color being overpowering. 

## Vintage Wedding Decor

Vintage wedding decorations often include lace, pearls, clear crystal glass and heirloom-worthy items. Browse our picks for [ceremony decorations](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-ceremony-decoration-ideas) and [reception decorations](https://www.theknot.com/content/easy-ways-to-decorate-your-wedding-reception) based on the vintage theme. 

### 5\. Vintage Wedding Place Setting

![Vintage wedding table placemat](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/e842a425-719b-4184-8571-c300c24df51f~rs_768.h-cr_0.225.1331.2000)

_[Photo: Jessica Morrisy Photography](https://www.theknot.com/real-weddings/beaded-champagne-table-linens-with-vintage-dinnerware-photo)_

For your vintage wedding table decor, focus on formal place settings and carefully curated details. No bare tables here—use lace tablecloths or classic white linens beneath a charger-and-dinner-plate combo. 

### 6\. Church Pew Decorations

![Church pew decorations](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/baaf0330-1580-4cdf-97c7-5d40aaa016db~rs_768.h-cr_1.8.599.805)

_Photo: Caroline Lima Photography_

Fresh flower wreaths can be tied to church pews, venue entrances or the backs of chairs using simple satin ribbon. 

### 7\. Vintage Typewriter Guestbook

![intage Typewriter Note From Couple, Postcard Guestbook for Guests](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/89718dbb-b6bc-4c57-9f21-da9d9f25abcd~rs_768.h-cr_0.169.1458.2113)

_[Photo: Unique Lapin Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/unique-lapin-photography-new-york-ny-556303)_

While a traditional guest book can also be vintage-inspired, a type writer adds a unique retro element to the mix. 

### 8\. Retro Lounge Setup

![Retro 1970s Lounge Setup With Velvet Details and Colorful DIY Art Backdrops](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/bee4e0ec-8fde-41bf-a0c4-bc315ce94203~rs_768.h-cr_0.169.1080.1609)

_[Photo: Chellise Michael Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/chellise-michael-photography-newburgh-ny-589297)_

If you're a fan of 1970s aesthetics, use velvet details and colorful art backdrops to deck out your wedding venue. 

### 9\. Vintage Trailer Photo Booth

![Vintage Trailer Photo Booth, Chairs and Potted Plants, Flowers With Lanterns in Industrial Garden](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/96061b35-41ec-4f3c-a1b8-50aa24d8acd6~rs_768.h-cr_166.0.1458.969)

_[Photo: Robert Carlo](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/robert-carlo-%7C-new-york-brooklyn-ny-581470)_

We love the idea of using a vintage trailer as a wedding photo booth. You'll get awesome pictures, whether you take your photos inside or out. 

### 10\. Library Checkout Card Table Numbers

![Library Checkout Card Table Numbers](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/1b8f1d3f-edac-4c85-be70-236b30270b17~rs_768.h)

_[Photo: Nikki Daskalakis](https://nikkidaskalakis.com/)_

If you're considering doing voice memos rather than a regular guest book, give it a vintage flair by installing a telephone booth. It'll look stunning and give your guests a bit of privacy to share their heartfelt message, too.

### 12\. Vintage Door Ceremony Backdrop

![Pastel Vintage Doors as Ceremony Backdrop](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/706e2471-474f-4398-9e09-3876f34e91a1~rs_768.h-cr_0.116.1458.2060)

_Photo: Krystal Healy Photography_

Using old doors as your ceremony backdrop (or even as your photo wall) is a unique and interesting element to add to your vintage wedding. 

### 13\. Chrome Disco Cake

![Chrome Lambeth Cake](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/391f1066-11dd-4883-ac34-abe5764bd980~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1458.1944)

_[Photo: Ruét Photo](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/ruet-photo-georgetown-tx-768995)_

This 1970s-inspired cake is perfect for couples who love disco. We love the way it's paired with a display case featuring an actual disco ball. 

### 14\. Calligraphy Escort Cards

![Escort cards for wedding](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/ad8380b7-5255-47e7-8737-031d72e3028b~rs_768.h-cr_0.215.2574.3647)

_[Photo: Brian Dorsey Studios](https://www.theknot.com/real-weddings/elegant-hand-calligraphed-escort-cards-photo)_

Invest in custom [wedding calligraphy](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-calligraphy-basics) for your escort cards or seating chart. It's one detail that will immediately elevate the ambience of the wedding reception.

### 15\. Flower and Candle Arrangements

![Fern centerpiece with candle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/23108af1-92a3-4f68-bb68-07137c76a7e2~rs_768.h-cr_0.467.2800.4200)

_[Photo: Mary Wyar Photography](https://www.theknot.com/real-weddings/green-fern-and-thistle-centerpiece-with-pillar-candles-photo)_

This combination of pillar candles and taper candles reminds us of holiday dinner centerpieces from the '90s (in the best way possible). Create something similar for your ceremony altar, head table or gift table. 

### 16\. Personal Menu Cards

![Menu card for evening receptipn](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/fdf8ceb7-8e55-4b95-a46d-a1b13ec9fb32~rs_768.h-cr_320.0.5440.3840)

_[Photo: Red Stone Photography](https://www.theknot.com/real-weddings/formal-gold-dinner-menu-photo)_

QR codes who? Outline the details of your multi-course dinner with individual paper menus. Sentimental guests will love taking them home as mementos. 

### 17\. Framed Table Numbers

![Framed tables numbers](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/7aa59411-0a3d-4dfc-91d3-c75577e7fb35~rs_768.h-cr_576.0.5191.3461)

_[Photo: Jason+Gina Wedding Photography](https://www.theknot.com/real-weddings/glass-picture-frame-table-numbers-photo)_

You don't need to get too fancy with your table numbers. The simpler, the better—choose unobtrusive frames to display basic handwritten or printed numbers. 

### 18\. Engraved Cake Cutting Set

![Engraved cake servers](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/72763822-5fc0-481a-b364-85e4b168ca3b~rs_768.h-cr_378.0.3346.2226)

_[Photo: Gloria Mesa Photography](https://www.theknot.com/real-weddings/engraved-cake-servers-photo)_

[Cutting the wedding cake](https://www.theknot.com/content/cutting-the-cake) with your partner has been a tradition for decades, and you can make the moment a little more personal by slicing into your dessert with an engraved knife and serving set. Not having cake at the wedding? Make a toast with special keepsake [champagne flutes](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-champagne-flutes) instead. 

### 19\. Vintage Wedding Cake Topper

![Bride and groom cake toppers](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/5243903a-e5b4-40b0-84ae-b6f5e15a609e~rs_768.h-cr_0.147.1730.2454)

_[Photo: Bailey Aro Photography](https://www.theknot.com/real-weddings/vintage-1950s-bride-and-groom-cake-topper-photo)_

We love the idea of using a [wedding cake topper](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-cake-toppers) that's been passed down by family or friends. You can also look for toppers at thrift stores, online resellers or purchase a custom vintage-inspired design. 

### 20\. Traditional Wedding Guest Book

![Ivory guest book](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/791297a4-03f4-4d17-a10e-85c1e40eb3dd~rs_768.h-cr_302.0.4099.2848)

_[Photo: Ben and Jodi Photography](https://www.theknot.com/real-weddings/message-from-couple-in-ivory-guest-book-photo)_

Embrace the idea of a vintage [wedding guest book](https://www.theknot.com/content/21-guest-books-that-make-great-keepsakes) by asking loved ones to share their handwritten well-wishes for your marriage. Choose a fabric-bound or leather-bound album you can display on a coffee table or bookshelf. 

### 21\. Silver Champagne Bucket

![Silver Champagne bucket](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/c18e0254-9b57-429e-b254-abfb65f670ff~rs_768.h-cr_0.50.600.850)

## Vintage Wedding Bouquet Ideas

Vintage wedding flowers and vintage wedding bouquets rely on timeless blooms, like peonies, roses, hydrangeas, lilies and orchids. Most importantly, you'll want to ask your [wedding florist](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/florists) to limit the amount of loose greenery or other filler elements. 

### 28\. Calla Lily Wedding Bouquet

![White Calla Lily ](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/f9dfa139-72ff-405c-aa5a-73687441b5c9~rs_768.h-cr_0.167.1333.1944)

_[Photo: Detour Weddings](https://www.theknot.com/real-weddings/white-calla-lily-virgin-mary-bouquet-photo)_

Thanks to their sleek, interestingly structured shape, calla lilies look amazing all on their own without the need for other flowers. 

### 29\. Blush and White Wedding Bouquet

![Women holding bouquets](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/15fd3b58-8d35-49f5-9062-23d9585ecdc2~rs_768.h-cr_440.0.3960.2640)

_[Photo: Christy Tyler Photography](https://www.theknot.com/real-weddings/classic-bouquets-of-white-roses-peonies-and-ranunculus-photo)_

Garden roses add a soft hint of pink amidst fluffy white blooms, like these ranunculus and dahlias.

### 30\. Rounded White Wedding Bouquet

![Picture of a white flower bouquet](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/61ee2b39-d30b-47b4-a92e-25ed6b580218~rs_768.h-cr_0.55.2173.2952)

_[Photo: Allison Kuhn Photography](https://www.theknot.com/real-weddings/large-white-blooms-and-greenery-bouquet-photo)_

Rounded [wedding bouquet shapes](https://www.theknot.com/content/a-glossary-of-bouquets-and-wedding-flowers) with minimal greenery work well for a vintage wedding theme compared to looser, larger arrangements, which can sometimes look a little too modern. 

### 31\. Cascading Wedding Bouquet

![Cascading wedding bouquet](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/fb9a06e8-9e6a-482b-a6ab-dd618d9e59d0~rs_768.h-cr_0.449.2636.3964)

_[Photo: Oeil Photography](https://www.theknot.com/real-weddings/cascading-bouquet-of-white-roses-and-ivy-photo)_

If you want a larger wedding bouquet, our suggestion is to go for a cascading bouquet shape with ivy vines and white flowers. This style was everything in the '80s—just take a look at [Princess Diana's bouquet](https://www.theknot.com/content/princess-diana-wedding-dress) if you need a reminder. 

### 32\. Orchid Wedding Bouquet

![Orchid and Dahlia bouquet](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/6042c3d9-a8ba-4f7b-ba6a-0664fe1c2967~rs_768.h-cr_305.0.5425.3840)

_[Photo: Grant & Deb Photographers](https://www.theknot.com/real-weddings/white-bouquet-with-orchids-and-dahlias-photo)_

Orchids tend to be associated with beach weddings and tropical themes, but in an all-white palette, they're incredibly chic. 

## Vintage Wedding Centerpiece Ideas

Unlike today's [wedding flower trends](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-flower-trends), vintage wedding centerpieces aren't packed with colorful flowers or unexpected details. Instead, opt for elegant, understated [wedding centerpieces](https://www.theknot.com/content/centerpieces-we-love) that look beautiful but don't overpower the tablescapes.

### 33\. Silver Candelabra Wedding Centerpiece

![Silver candlestick holder](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/3b70fb7d-da80-4982-a90b-0dea6afbeb66~rs_768.h-cr_0.80.900.1280)

_[Photo: Nate Henderson](https://www.theknot.com/real-weddings/candelabra-centerpiece-with-white-flowers-and-candles-photo)_

Tall candelabras serve as the focal point, allowing you to downsize your flower arrangements. 

### 34\. White Pillar Candle Wedding Centerpiece

![White floral centerpiece with candles](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/0f6c8c5f-54d6-41a2-91ea-bf15fd285387~rs_768.h-cr_0.177.3456.4785)

_[Photo: Alison Conklin Photography](https://www.theknot.com/real-weddings/white-floral-centerpieces-with-candles-photo-1)_

Place white pillar candles in a silver compote vase and surround them with white blooms, greenery sprigs and votives for a [classic wedding idea](https://www.theknot.com/content/classic-wedding-ideas). 

### 35\. Simple Wedding Centerpiece with Votives

![Wedding centerpiece with flowers](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/ee113eb9-bdac-43c4-b662-223f947a3188~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.2574.3432)

_Photo: Jerry Yoon Photographers_

Clear glass votives are so simple but so romantic. Incorporate layers of detail by adding textured table linens, low flower centerpieces and votives at different heights. 

### 36\. Tall Rose Wedding Centerpiece

![Tall white rose centerpiece](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/8f40fbc1-8cca-4c3f-bc3e-e7a6fbca6e7d~rs_768.h-cr_0.275.3303.4679)

_[Photo: David Sixt Photography](https://www.theknot.com/real-weddings/tall-white-rose-centerpieces-photo-1)_

Grand reception venues, like ballrooms and banquet halls, call for centerpieces that can hold their own in the space. This tall centerpiece featuring a mix of white and blush blooms was made for a vintage-inspired black tie wedding. 

### 37\. Floating Candle Wedding Centerpiece

![Floating candle centerpieces](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/c5c42f8d-3b24-4fe3-b753-42e30e8a7790~rs_768.h-cr_0.609.3744.5601)

_[Photo: Kathi Littwin Photography](https://www.theknot.com/real-weddings/pink-rose-and-hydrangea-centerpiece-photo)_

We didn't know we needed floating candles until we saw this centerpiece. The long-stemmed candle holders add just the right amount of height to balance the small rounded flower arrangement. 

### 38\. Vintage-Glam Floral Centerpieces

![Expansive Dining Table With Tall, Large Floral Centerpieces, Candles in Ancient Castle Hall](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/e2176419-4e0b-4ad7-af64-793895583fa3~rs_768.h-cr_0.129.1458.2073)

_[Photo: El Marco Rojo](https://elmarcorojo.com/)_

Using tall florals as centerpieces will give your reception tables an ultra-glam look that gives _Great Gatsby_ energy.

### 39\. 1960s Vibe Floral Centerpiece

![Orange Bar With Centerpiece of Orchids, Garden Roses and Fall Flowers](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/e6fc80b1-7584-454b-b0c3-29580281ef37~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1458.1944)

_[Photo: Ruét Photo](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/ruet-photo-georgetown-tx-768995)_

These messy florals combined with the burnt terracotta bar? It gives a 1960s vibe without being totally in your face. 

## Editor's Vintage Wedding Favorites

Want to know what's at the top of our must-have inspo list? Here are the vintage wedding ideas that will add a little extra something to your celebration. 

### 40\. Something Blue

_[Photo: Caroline Lima Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/caroline-lima-photography-dallas-tx-769078)_

Vintage weddings are about tradition if nothing else. For the 'blue' portion of the [something borrowed, something blue tradition](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-traditions-the-meaning-of-something-old), pin a small blue bead, fabric scrap or charm to your wedding day attire for good luck. 

### 41\. Lace Wedding Ring Pillow

![Lace ring pillow](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/aa52e69e-9f7c-4c07-8cd4-4f2f8462675c~rs_768.h-cr_280.0.4757.3358)

_[Photo: Shanna Edberg Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/shanna-edberg-photography-baltimore-md-871284)_

Kitschy briefcases, signs and ring boxes have their time and place, but for a vintage wedding theme, you can't beat a simple [ring bearer](https://www.theknot.com/content/ring-bearers-duties-in-detail) pillow. 

### 42\. Vintage Convertible

![Bride in a vintage convertible](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/f9489c55-fed7-47b3-8e55-be09db4278c1~rs_768.h)

_[Photo: Megan Noll Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/megan-noll-photography-cincinnati-oh-888159)_

For your grand exit at the end of the reception, you'll need a swanky [vintage wedding car](https://www.theknot.com/content/the-getaway-car). Work with a [transportation vendor near you](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/transportation-services) to rent a vintage convertible and impress guests with your sweet ride.

### 43\. Live Jazz Band

![Jazz band during wedding reception](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/f2d1a157-de16-4370-9ad0-6f546676defc~rs_768.h-cr_89.0.3609.2640)

_[Photo: Pen Carlson Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/pen-carlson-photography-chicago-il-199765)_

A live band can tap into guests' nostalgia by playing jazz, big band tunes, swing dance music or classic rock and roll.

### 44\. Retro Phone Audio Guest Book

![Audio recording vintage phones](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/c8ae30c9-88e7-4933-8b40-b6fa2c7c2ab5~rs_768.h-cr_59.0.1020.721)

_Photo: After the Tone/Instagram_

These retro phones aren't just for show—they're [audio wedding guest books](https://www.theknot.com/content/audio-guest-book) that record your guests' congratulatory messages at the wedding and preserve them for you to listen to on repeat. 

### 45\. Single-Stem Boutonniere

![groom wearing black tux](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/f9e48a7d-0973-47b9-aa57-6f5173b1f944~rs_768.h-cr_0.32.2006.2707)

A black tuxedo doesn't need a lot of accessorizing, but a white calla lily boutonniere is a stylish finishing touch. 

### 46\. Vintage Wedding Cake

![Vintage wedding cake with white flowers](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/68f3bf93-059b-4e3a-92d5-9309f279ca40~rs_768.h-cr_429.0.3861.2574)

Decorate your [vintage wedding cake](https://www.theknot.com/content/retro-wedding-cakes-throwback-thursday) with classic cake baker's techniques, like hand-piping, beadwork and Swiss dots. 

### 47\. Heart-Shaped Cake

![Heart-shaped wedding cake](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/1ca7d57c-5af9-4e21-843f-0300242b35cd~rs_768.h-cr_0.227.1600.2360)

Looking for a cake with a little more personality? A [heart-shaped cake](https://www.theknot.com/content/heart-shaped-wedding-cake) is completely on-brand for the vintage wedding theme. 

### 48\. Birdseed Toss

![Husband and wife wedding exit with birdseed toss](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/c218031b-2469-472f-814c-89cee6610a64~rs_768.h-cr_39.0.839.600)

_[Photo: Caroline Lima Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/caroline-lima-photography-dallas-tx-769078)_

Tossing rice or birdseed is said to bring good luck to the newlyweds (but really, we just think it looks amazing in photos). For environmental clean-up reasons, some venues don't allow rice or birdseed to be thrown on their property, so consider flower petals, dried lavender or bubbles instead.
