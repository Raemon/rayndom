Bridal shower themes can take a party from fun to unforgettable. But how do you go about deciding on a theme that's as special as the bride themselves? Start by thinking about their personality and interests. A classic bride, for example, might love getting together for a simple tea party. An adventurous bride, on the other hand, might want to head outdoors and into nature. From there, it can be helpful to think about the logistics, like the budget and time of year the shower will be taking place. ([Summer](https://www.theknot.com/content/summer-bridal-shower-themes), [fall](https://www.theknot.com/content/fall-bridal-shower-themes), [spring](https://www.theknot.com/content/spring-bridal-shower-themes) and [winter](https://www.theknot.com/content/winter-bridal-shower-themes) each bring about new theme ideas.)

### 1."Fresh Off The Market" Bridal Shower

We love this wedding shower theme idea for the person who's always visiting their local farmers market to check out the latest goodies and fresh produce. You can create different "stalls" throughout the party space to recreate the look of a real farmers market, with each stall offering various desserts, games, favors and more. Send guests home with baskets of berries, jars of jam and other delicious treats from the day.

### 2\. "Something Blue" Bridal Shower

Searching for a timeless-yet-trendy bridal shower theme for your upcoming event? We have the perfect solution: "Something Blue Before 'I Do'". Start by decorating the party area in baby blue decor. Think: Blue balloons, table settings and floral arrangements. Then, have each guest arrive wearing the same shade of blue. The bride will be the only one on white, as to stand out in photos. Have guests pitch in for a blue gift for the bride (a piece of jewelry or a small trinket) that she can use as her "something blue" on the wedding day.

["Something Blue" Shower Ideas](https://www.theknot.com/content/something-blue-bridal-shower)

### 3\. Bow Bridal Shower

If, like us, you're completely bow crazed, you'll love this cute bridal shower theme. Not only is bow decor adorable, but it's also a perfect representation of the phrase, "tying the knot". You can add bows to everything from the champagne glass stems to the entryway and even the desserts. Looking for a fun bridal shower game to add to the itinerary? Have each guest tie a ribbon in a bow around their finger. Encourage them to avoid using the word "bride" throughout the event. If someone catches you saying it, they can snatch your ribbon. The guest who ends up with the most ribbons wins!

### 4\. Italian Bridal Shower

A day spent with all your besties by your side? Now that's amore! You can channel an Italian summer vibe for your bridal shower by opting for this fun wedding shower theme. It's especially ideal for a bride who's always dreamed of visiting Italy. Start by setting out ingredients for guests to make their own personal pizza. Top it all off with bottomless Aperol spritzes and a playlist of classics by Dean Martin.

[Italian Bridal Shower Ideas](https://www.theknot.com/content/italian-themed-bridal-shower)

### 5\. Coffee Bridal Shower

Celebrate the love that's brewing between the bride and groom with a coffee theme bridal shower. You can hire a caterer to serve coffee and brunch to all your guests (bonus points if they're a pro at latte art), or, if you're working with a tighter budget, you can set up a build your own coffee station. [Pantone's Color of the Year](https://www.theknot.com/content/pantone-color-year), "Mocha Mousse" is a perfect option for all the decor. Cue "Espresso" by Sabrina Carpenter for the bride's grand entrance and you'll be ready to go.

### 6\. "Pearls and Prosecco" Bridal Shower

If you've scrolled through Pinterest recently, you've probably seen ideas for a "Pearls and Prosecco" or "Petals and Prosecco" bridal shower. Both themes offer a trendy twist on your classic boozy brunch. You can choose either pearls or petals as the basis of your decor. The prosecco part on the other hand is pretty self explanatory. 

[Pearls and Prosecco Ideas](https://www.theknot.com/content/petals-prosecco-bridal-shower)

### 7\. "Love is in Bloom" Bridal Shower

Our love for this theme is certainly blooming. Surprise a flower-obsessed to-be-wed with a botanical bridal shower theme. Fill the event space with fresh (or faux) flowers, serve flower-infused refreshments and send guests home with mini bouquets or potted plants. If you're looking for a fun activity for guests to enjoy during the event, consider creating a bouquet-making station with flowers from your local grocery store. Have guests get creative by mixing and matching their favorite blooms to create a totally unique bouquet.

### 8\. "Mimosas and Matrimony" Bridal Shower

Name a better duo…we'll wait. In all seriousness, we're obsessed with this theme for a bridal shower. It's the perfect way to level up your classic bridal shower brunch. You can build your own mimosa bar, complete with various flavors of juice and freshly sliced fruit. Have guests arrive in citrus-inspired hues like orange, yellow and pink. After playing games and opening gifts, have the bride celebrate her upcoming nuptials with a champagne shower (don't forget to snap candid pics.)

### 9\. "Berry in Love" Bridal Shower

We're *berry* obsessed with this idea, and who could blame us? Strawberries don't just make a delicious summertime snack, they also make for a cute bridal shower theme. Start by tossing a red and white gingham table cloth onto a table, then use fresh strawberries as part of the decor. From strawberry shortcake to strawberry balsamic salad and even strawberry mimosas, there are countless recipe ideas to go along with this theme.

### 10\. "She Found Her Matcha" Bridal Shower

Pour the matcha, she found her match! Gather up your group for a bridal shower brunch featuring plenty of matcha tea and all things green. In addition to decking out the event space in matcha green decor, you can also request that guests come wearing green while the bride wears white to stand out. If you want to take the theme to the next level, consider hiring a professional to lead a matcha ceremony—a traditional Japanese tea ceremony that focusses on mindfulness and zen.

## Unique Bridal Shower Themes

For a one-of-a-kind bride, you need options that go beyond the ordinary bridal shower agenda. That's where unique wedding shower themes come in. Whether you're looking for an unexpected way to decorate, or you're hoping to get everyone engaged in a fun group activity, we think you'll love the cool bridal shower themes we've rounded up below.

**Unique bridal shower themes:** Boat Ride | Cooking Class | Paint and Sip | Spa Day | Bookworm | Astrology | Escape Room | Murder Mystery | Charity

### 11\. Boat Ride Bridal Shower

When it comes to unique bridal shower themes and ideas, you can't go wrong with a boat ride! Whether you opt for a sunset sail or a daytime harbor cruise, your crew will love the opportunity to celebrate at sea. Not to mention, there are countless nautical puns you can include on the invites and decor. "Last Sail Before the Veil", "Seashells and Wedding Bells" and "Bridal Toast on the Coast" are a few of our faves.

### Find your kind of venue

From barns to ballrooms, discover reception venues that feel like you.

### 12\. Cooking Class Bridal Shower

Cooking classes are a fun way to spend time with your inner circle—plus, they'll help you pick up a few new skills. If the bride loves experimenting in the kitchen, treat her to an afternoon of cooking lessons. Hire a chef to lead your group, then host a friendly cook-off to see who can make the best dish. Regardless of who wins, everyone will get to indulge in a delicious meal at the end. Ask guests to bring their favorite recipe or kitchen item (based on the couple's [wedding registry](https://www.theknot.com/registry)) as a gift.

### 13\. Paint and Sip Bridal Shower

Tap into your artistic side with this unique bridal shower theme that's fun for guests young and old. This lighthearted activity will help your guests break the ice and make small talk—and you might even find out that you have an artist in your crew. You can either host the party at a professional painting studio or at someone's home (just keep in mind that you'll need to provide all of the supplies on your own if that's the case). Serve refreshments and light snacks with a playlist queued up to spark everyone's creativity.

![Paint and sip cute bridal shower theme](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/15f32ec7-254b-429b-b754-a0dd62c1273a~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1080.1440)

### 14\. Spa Day Bridal Shower

Everyone can always use an excuse for some R&R—especially those who are in the midst of planning a wedding. Treat the bride-to-be to a day of pampering and downtime with a spa-themed bridal shower. If your guest list is fairly small, consider renting a private room at a spa for the day and splurging on facials or massages. Otherwise, you can recreate a spa vibe in your own home with soothing candles, music and ambient lighting. Provide cozy robes, refreshments and pampering products, like nail polish and aromatherapy lotion.

### 15\. Bookworm Bridal Shower

What better bridal shower theme could you choose for someone who loves to read? Pick one of the bride's favorite reads to inspire the entire theme of the party, or use various books from their favorite genres or authors. Incorporate library inspired decor, like catalog cards, famous literary love quotes and paper flower centerpieces. Ask guests to follow the theme by bringing books as gifts for the couple or hand out "mystery books" wrapped in plain brown paper as party favors.

![Bookworm bridal shower idea](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/18c88345-b8ae-467a-b0e6-eb5707bddc0b~rs_768.h-cr_0.184.1080.1624)

### 16\. Astrology Bridal Shower

If the bride religiously checks her horoscope and swears by analyzing people's birth charts, throwing her an astrology-themed bridal shower might be written in the stars. Deck out the party space in zodiac-themed decor and hire a professional astrologer to do readings or predictions. Bonus points if your celebration takes place at night and you can add a bit of stargazing to the agenda.

### 17\. Escape Room Bridal Shower

Bridal showers offer a chance for the bride's closest friends and family to bond ahead of the big day, and what better way to do that than with a collaborative activity? An escape room bridal shower lets guests skip the awkward small stalk stage and get to know each other on a whole new level while working together to solve puzzles. We can guarantee they'll be talking about the experience for years to come.

### 18\. Murder Mystery Bridal Shower

When you think of themes for bridal showers, a murder mystery party likely isn't the first thing that comes to mind, and perhaps that's what makes it so great. Similarly to escape room bridal showers, this funny bridal shower theme allows everyone to work together to solve a mystery—we can't think of any better way to break the ice! There are endless themes to choose from when planning a murder mystery bridal shower, from "masquerade ball" to "wild west".

### 19\. Charity Bridal Shower

For the to-be-weds who don't see the need for traditional shower gifts (like cookware and bath linens), why not use the wedding shower as an opportunity to pay it forward? This unique bridal shower theme could also work for anyone who'd rather not be the center of attention at a gift-giving extravaganza. In lieu of bringing registry gifts to the bridal shower, ask guests to donate to the couple's [charity registry](https://www.theknot.com/content/charitable-donations-instead-of-wedding-gifts) or favorite non-profit organization.

## Fun Bridal Shower Themes

Remember: Your guests are here for a good time, not a long time. Pack as much excitement as you can into a few hour time frame by opting for a fun bridal shower theme. Whether it involves music and dancing or a fun interactive activity, it's a guaranteed way to create lasting memories. Below, we've rounded up nine ideas to inspire your event.

**Fun bridal shower themes:** Beach | Stock-the-Bar | Party Bus | Mamma Mia! | Roaring '20s | Taylor Swift | Beyoncé | Lingerie | PowerPoint

### 20\. Beach Bridal Shower

Whether you head to the coast or decide to stay local, this bridal shower party theme is a classic. Serve piña coladas and daiquiris along with food from a local Caribbean or Jamaican catering company. Decorate with brightly colored flowers and beach-themed accents, such as rattan furniture, pineapples, flamingos and tropical greenery. Oh, and don't forget to make a playlist filled with hits from The Beach Boys and Bob Marley.

### 21\. Stock-the-Bar Bridal Shower

A stock-the-bar bridal shower is perfect if the to-be-weds are cocktail connoisseurs with a wedding registry full of cool barware. This unique idea is a little different from a typical wedding shower because guests are invited to bring an alcohol-centric item from the couple's registry or a bottle of alcohol to help them stock the bar in their newlywed home. If you're in search of a good [coed wedding shower idea](https://www.theknot.com/content/couple-bridal-shower-basics), this is it. What better way for their closest friends to meet, mingle and celebrate the happy duo?

[Stock-the-Bar Shower Ideas](https://www.theknot.com/content/stock-the-bar-bridal-shower-basics)

### 22\. Party Bus Bridal Shower

Party buses and limousines aren't limited to just bachelorette parties, you know? You can hire a chauffeur for your bridal shower to drive your group to a variety of different destinations (from brunch, to the nail salon to your local wine bar.) Not only will you feel like celebs for the day, but it will also eliminate the hassle of having to coordinate rides and parking.

![Party bus fun bridal shower idea](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/96fd3877-1ef8-4066-bb1f-c958b9f84b30~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1080.1440)

### 23\. _Mamma Mia!_ Bridal Shower

Mamma Mia, she's getting married! To throw a themed bridal shower based on the beloved film series, take note from our [_Mamma Mia!_ bachelorette party](https://www.theknot.com/content/mamma-mia-bachelorette-party) guide. Deck out the party space in white and blue–colorful vases filled with bougainvillea stems are a perfect added touch. Give every attendee a feather boa and get ready to dance the night away to all your favorite ABBA tunes.

### 24\. Roaring '20s Bridal Shower

Let Jay Gatsby be your inspiration for this fun bridal shower theme. Host a 1920s party with the help of feather plume centerpieces, sequined tablecloths, faux pearl strands and sparkling crystal tableware. Ask guests to wear their best flapper-inspired looks—and don't forget the champagne tower.

### 25\. Taylor Swift Bridal Shower

This wedding shower theme is a must for any die-hard Swiftie. To set the scene, invite your guests to come dressed in an outfit inspired by their favorite Taylor Swift era (think: a sundress and cowboy boots for Fearless, an all-black ensemble for Reputation or a boho dress for Folklore). Transform the venue with bridal shower decorations and vignettes inspired by each album, and don't forget the playlist full of [Taylor Swift love songs](https://www.theknot.com/content/taylor-swift-1989-album-wedding-songs) to sing along to throughout the party.

### 26\. Beyoncé Bridal Shower

Everyone deserves to be a little "drunk in love" at some point in their lives, so why not opt for a Beyoncé-themed bridal shower? There's no better way to ring in the end of your "feyoncé" era than by dancing the day away to Bey hits alongside your besties. Have each attendee come dressed in an outfit inspired by a different Beyoncé album. From Destiny's Child to Cowboy Carter, there's endless ways to make this theme your own.

### 27\. Lingerie Bridal Shower

If you're ready to get a little risqué with your group, a lingerie bridal shower is a fun option. For this bridal shower party theme, guests bring lingerie, robes and other sultry accessories instead of traditional gifts. The most important thing is to clear this theme with the bride before you start planning—you don't want her or any of the guests (ahem, mom and grandma) to feel uncomfortable with the concept.

[Lingerie Bridal Shower Ideas](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-to-throw-lingerie-shower)

### 28\. PowerPoint Party Bridal Shower

A few weeks before the event, ask each guest to prepare a short slideshow or speech (under three minutes) about any topic their heart desires—the more creative, the better. (Some guests may want to pair up in teams if they already know each other.) A few ideas: a ranking of the best celebrity weddings or most memorable movie wedding dresses. At the party, guests take turns sharing with the crowd. At the end of the day, everyone will have learned something new—or at least had a good laugh. Raise the stakes by asking everyone to dress up in office attire.

## Cute Bridal Shower Themes

The key to capturing really cute photo-ops is choosing a really cute theme. Cute bridal shower themes are perfect for those who love to go all-out with decorations. There's also plenty of opportunity to have guests dress up according to the chosen theme. Below, we've rounded up nine adorable ideas to inspire your event.

**Cute bridal shower themes:**Brunch | Tea-Party | Garden-Party | Slumber-Party | Recipe-Exchange | Taco | Barbie | Galentine's-Day | Flower Power

### 29\. Brunch Bridal Shower

When in doubt, you can never go wrong with a classic [bridal shower brunch](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-shower-brunch). After all, what bride doesn't love a good mimosa with a side of pancakes? You can host the event at the bride's favorite restaurant or DIY an epic brunch setup from home. Pro tip: Choose a theme or color scheme for the event and encourage guests to come dressed accordingly. That way, you'll all look coordinated during obligatory photo-ops!

### 30\. Tea-Party Bridal Shower

Overwhelmed with bridal shower ideas? Why not plan an afternoon tea for the bride-to-be? It's a timeless option that's guaranteed to please everyone in the group—especially the guest of honor! As guests, they'll love getting to dress up in floppy sunhats and elbow-length gloves, and as the party planner, you'll love how cost-effective it is. All you'll need is an array of teas, finger sandwiches and pastries. You can even peruse your local thrift store for vintage china to use on the day of the event.

![Tea party bridal shower idea](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/ab9c26ec-4e90-4318-be02-f90044b5628c~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1080.1440)

### 31\. Garden-Party Bridal Shower

Flowers and showers go hand in hand, so why not take things outside and host a bridal shower in the garden? Gardens offer a peaceful and quiet setting—perfect for an intimate brunch or dinner party. Hang a string of fairy lights over the party area to create a whimsical vibe the bride is sure to love. Oh, and be sure to check the weather forecast and set up a canopy if there's a chance of rain.

[Garden Party Bridal Shower Ideas](https://www.theknot.com/content/garden-theme-bridal-shower)

### 32\. Slumber-Party Bridal Shower

In our books, you're never too old for a slumber-party. Have your crew pack their favorite pair of PJs and join you for a cozy night in to celebrate your upcoming nuptials. Watch movies, give each other makeovers and have a pillowfight—it will be just like the good ol day, only now, you can do it all tipsy. As for the menu, keep things simple by ordering in a few pizzas. 

![Slumber party bridal shower](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/e68e2d17-ddf2-4e5d-bf84-f702076acb00~rs_768.h-cr_0.154.1080.1594)

### 33\. Recipe-Exchange Bridal Shower

If the bride is a self-proclaimed foodie, or someone who loves to cook, why not throw her a recipe exchange bridal shower? After all, there are few gifts as sentimental as a secret family recipe. The party can be hosted potluck style (which is a great budget-friendly bridal shower idea), with each guest bringing their favorite dish and a hand-written recipe card to go along with it. During the party, the recipes can be compiled into a book to give to the bride at the end.

[Recipe Exchange Shower Ideas](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-shower-recipe-cards)

### 34\. Taco Bridal Shower 

Taco-bout the perfect bridal shower theme! If your crew never misses a Taco Tuesday, this idea is an obvious choice. Put your mixology skills to the test by creating a variety of margarita flavors to accompany tacos, nachos, quesadillas and churros. Who can resist an invite to an event titled "Margs and Matrimony"?

### 35\. Barbie Bridal Shower

This Barbie is getting married. Decorate with all things pink and glittery for this fun bridal shower theme inspired by the [Barbiecore aesthetic](https://www.theknot.com/content/barbiecore-pink-wedding-outfits) (and don't forget the head-to-toe pink outfits). Planning a bach party too? We also love a [Barbie-themed bachelorette](https://www.theknot.com/content/barbie-bachelorette-party).

### 36\. Galentine's-Day Bridal Shower

This wedding shower theme is a cute idea if the party is planned for February. Start with a [Valentine's Day-inspired color palette](https://www.theknot.com/content/valentines-day-wedding-ideas-real-couples) of pink, red and purple, then add heart-shaped decorations, cupid decals and whimsical balloons. Send guests home with handmade chocolate party favors and other sweet treats.

### 37\. Flower Power Bridal Shower

### 38\. _Bridgerton_ Bridal Shower

If the bride-to-be can't get enough of _Bridgerton_ , put a twist on the traditional tea party wedding shower with a Regency-era makeover. Start by shopping from our collection of [Bridgerton x The Knot](https://www.theknot.com/paper/bridgerton) bridal shower invitations. To bring your _Bridgerton_ -themed bridal shower to life, consult a local florist for lush floral arrangements, greenery garlands and dainty topiaries. Create lavish tablescapes with formal china, floral tablecloths and place cards inspired by society papers. As for the menu, serve fancy finger sandwiches, pastel cupcakes and a variety of tea flavors to take guests back in time to England circa 1811.

### 39\. _Pride and Prejudice_ Bridal Shower

Speaking of the Regency era, another one of our favorite bridal shower theme ideas is to host an event inspired by Jane Austen's _Pride and Prejudice_. Similarly to above, you can bring this theme to life by having everyone dress in outfits inspired by the time period. Empire-waisted dresses, evening gloves and elegant updos are all a must. Throw in a screening of the 2005 movie adaptation and you've got yourself a memorable event.

### 40\. _Breakfast at Tiffany's_ Bridal Shower

Upgrade the traditional mimosa brunch shower idea with an Audrey Hepburn-approved twist. Decorate your space with Tiffany blue decorations and New York City-inspired accents. Serve croissants, coffee and bubbly beverages to channel Holly Golightly's iconic ritual of having breakfast in front of Tiffany's. Invite guests to come dressed in black mini dresses and supply strands of pearls to emulate the classic film.

### 41\. "Rosé All Day" Bridal Shower

On a sunny summer afternoon, there's nothing better than sitting outside and sipping a cold glass of rosé. Channel that positive energy with a rosé bridal shower theme for your guest of honor. Pink decorations, beverages and rose centerpieces are all musts, and you can also instruct guests to come dressed in their cutest pink attire. Sunglasses and rosé-infused gummy bears are sweet [bridal shower favors](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-shower-favors) for this theme.

### 42\. Lemon Bridal Shower

This bridal shower theme for summer is an excuse to decorate your space with bright colors and fun details inspired by Italy's Amalfi Coast. Serve aperol spritzes or another signature drink garnished with freshly sliced lemons, and design the bar to look like a lemonade stand for a nostalgic touch. Use real [lemons in your centerpieces](https://www.theknot.com/content/11-gorgeous-centerpieces-with-fruit) and complete the look with striped tablecloths, mismatched patterned plates and bottles of limoncello as favors.

### 43\. Paris Bridal Shower

Looking for a fresh take on the Paris-themed wedding shower? Plan a soirée inspired by Emily in Paris. Create a menu inspired by the finest French foods (read: cheese, wine, croissants and plenty of baguettes). To customize this cute bridal shower theme, replace "Emily" with the bride-to-be's name. Decorate with French flags, Eiffel Tower decals and a poster of the Mona Lisa—and don't forget to make a playlist of French café jazz music for the right ambiance.

### 44\. Après Ski Bridal Shower

Turn your party into a wintry ski chalet for this playful bridal shower theme. It's a great way to pay homage to the couple's personalities if they love to go skiing together. Create a menu of hot drinks (buttered rum, spiked hot chocolate, Irish coffee) and hearty soups to keep everyone cozy. For a good laugh, ask guests to dress up in retro skiing attire à la the 1970s and '80s.

### 45\. Kentucky Derby Bridal Shower

…And they're off to the altar! Celebrate the bride's upcoming nuptials with a race day-themed bridal shower. There are countless games that can go along with this theme—guests can even take bets on who will win. Of course, no derby party is complete without the outfits, so be sure to encourage everyone to come wearing their biggest and boldest hats.

### 47\. Picnic Bridal Shower

Enjoy the spring weather with a picnic bridal shower. This theme is one of the latest [bridal shower trends](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-shower-trends) that we're loving, because it's all about creating a relaxed and welcoming atmosphere.

Bring Napa Valley to you with a day of wine tastings. DIY the party by visiting your local winery (or the nearest specialty wine store) to get a variety of blends to sip while celebrating the soon-to-be newlyweds.

### 50\. Western Bridal Shower

Cue the country music and cowboy boots. This rustic bridal shower theme is a fitting choice if the couple is having a [barn wedding](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-to-have-barn-wedding-planning-tips).

### 51\. Glamping Bridal Shower

If the bride loves to camp but an actual getaway isn't in the budget, consider opting for a backyard staycation instead. Organize a glamping party, complete with decorated tents, picnic blankets, oversized floor cushions and a movie projector. Be sure to give guests a heads up on the invitations to wear comfortable, outdoorsy attire and to pack an overnight bag if needed.

### 52\. Hiking Bridal Shower

Ready to take your bridal shower planning to new heights? Gather up your crew and head to the nearest hiking trail. You'll spend the morning climbing to the peak, stopping for plenty of group photo-ops along the way. Once you reach the top, set up a picnic and enjoy the view.
