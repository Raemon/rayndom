Alex

Lead Videographer

From the quiet, intimate moments to the high-energy celebrations, I work closely with couples to understand their vision, vibe, and values. My role goes beyond just filming — I guide the flow, direct when needed, and stay in sync with the photographer and planner to make sure your day unfolds smoothly on camera. With years of experience behind the lens, I lead a team that’s dedicated to capturing your love story in the most beautiful and meaningful way possible. Whether it's a backyard ceremony or a destination wedding, I bring the same level of care, commitment, and cinematic flair to every event.

Absolutely incredible! We cannot recommend our wedding videographer highly enough. From our very first meeting, they made us feel comfortable and truly listened to what we wanted. ...

The final video was beyond our expectations—beautifully edited, emotional, and perfectly told the story of our day. We’ve watched it countless times and still get teary-eyed! Thank you for giving us memories we’ll cherish forever. If you’re looking for someone talented, professional, and genuinely passionate about their work, look no further!
