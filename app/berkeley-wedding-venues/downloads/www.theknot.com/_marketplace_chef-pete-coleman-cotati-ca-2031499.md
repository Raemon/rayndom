I can't even describe how AMAZING our food for our wedding was. It was by far the best food I have ever had at a wedding. Chef Pete and his staff were top notch! From there appetiz...

ers, to their oyster bar and the dinner was phenomenal. They also have a bar package as well if you are interested in both, we just did their food service and it was amazing. I could not recommend Chef Pete enough! If you want a 5 star dinner for your wedding, choose Chef Pete!!!

We had Chef Pete cater our wedding a few weeks ago. It's taken me a lot of time to write this review, mostly because I was unsure of whether I wanted to put my energy into writing ...

a negative review, but at the end of the day I feel like this is a good way to get all my feelings about it out of the way so I can leave the good memories to reminisce on later. We paid for 57 guests and we were also charged for our photographer's food since I requested he eat at the same time as guests. This ended up being money wasted since he was fed late anyways. From the get go, Chef Pete's communication was lacking. This should have been red flag #1 but I convinced myself he was just busy. However, even down to one week before my wedding he stopped returning my texts. Mind you, it was a text from me trying to pay him the money I owed him! I didn't hear back until a few days before my wedding. Our food service was incredibly slow and portions were not at all what I was expecting for the price per head. Our reception dinner ran almost an HOUR late, and even then dessert still hadn't been served! We had to move everyone inside for the cake cutting, and ended up just serving the dessert on the dessert table, which I was not happy about. Portions were tiny, and I could tell guests were still hungry by the end of the night which was the complete opposite of what I was hoping for when I initially chose to hire Pete. We had two guests with dietary restrictions. Only 2!! Yet our vegan guest was given his food late for all the plates, and they gave the meal placard for our other guest with dietary restrictions to the wrong person! So one of our guests without dietary restrictions randomly had to eat no pork and seafood for absolutely no reason. This is completely unacceptable. All of our venue staff and my event coordinator agreed his service was extremely unprofessional, in fact our venue took him off of their list of preferred vendors. I could tell this myself because even after all the delays, he never came out once to say hi to us, let alone apologize for the errors. I learned the next day from my event coordinator that the reason for the slow service was that him and his team arrived 2 hours late to the venue. Absolutely insane behavior for the money we paid him. The only positive I have is that what little food we were able to eat was pretty tasty, and that his wait staff was professional. If you have any other options for catering, I'd advise you to stay away from chef Pete.

Response from Chef Pete Coleman on 08/04/2024

Ok. Communication: Everyone has a different threshold for responsiveness, I’m not here t...

o hold your hand, if you need someone to talk to I recommend a family member, not a busy Chef. Also, she didn’t communicate the vegetarians and vegans until the day of the event so it’s a wonder they got fed at all. Also, the “Coordinator” she hired for the day didn’t speak any of the 3.5 languages I speak (English, Spanish, French, a little German)… So I’d say a fair number of the “Communication” issues reside there. Like the fact I told her that the photographers food was ready in the kitchen, but of course, I told her in a language she obviously didn’t understand, AKA, English. Timeliness: 2 hours is a lie, we were exactly 50 minutes late and the dining area was set with 30 minutes to spare. Regardless of what time the staff got there the event was set up on time and Hors D’Oeuvres were served on time. Everyone, including the client and guests ran a little late because of traffic coming out of Los Gatos to the Santa Cruz mountains…if you know, you know. Also, it says right on my contract that vendors eat while guests are eating. So this self important “photographer” should have waited to eat with the rest. A multi-course plated meal takes time. We can’t begin the next course until the course being served is complete and fully bussed. We were cooking as fast as they were eating, the issue is since the bride and groom eat first they notice the lag the most…unavoidable. Th The timeline we received from the clients day of coordinator (on the day of the event) did not allow enough time for the multi course meal. And frankly the day of coordinator seemed surprised by the fact that we were plating individually instead of sending it all at once. They probably should have asked for a buffet, if I had seen the timeline even a week prior I would’ve suggested as much. Portion Size: They should have made the time to come up to Napa for a tasting, if they had they would have seen the portions, and if they wanted bigger portions they should have ordered cheaper food…Black Cod and Filet Mignon are not cheap. And she even admits that the staff were professional and the food was tasty. Not Coming Out to “Apologize”: Why would I apologize for the incompetent coordinator, the photographer (who has a clause in his contract that her charges $250 if his dinner is late, verified by the venue!) And an unrealistic timeline. Again: To Summarize according the the client the staff were professional and the food was tasty. That’s really about all I can control. Nothing was missing, no one was rude or unprofessional, the food was tasty. If we were set up and ready to go on time, ask the Janelle, the venue manager. The timing is arbitrary, evidently this client and coordinator don’t eat out much, as we all know you can’t rush the Chef. Megan, I’m sorry you were unhappy with the timing. The rest sounds like complaining to me. Pete.

Delectable food, outstanding service. Our wedding banquet was an enormous success thanks to Chef Pete and his charming staff. Each dish presented at the buffet was scrumptious and ...

memorable—nearly every guest made a point to compliment us on our choice of caterer. The waiters were attentive, pleasant and professional. The bartenders were lively, courteous and eager-to-pour. Thank you, all!

My husband found Chef Pete Coleman through thumbtack and he had an impressive list of positive reviews! We reached out to them as we were planning our belated wedding reception for...

around 150 people. Pete's team was very responsive and made themselves available via phone and email from the beginning. We really appreciated that they were straightforward with their pricing without added costs. We brought our family for our tasting and his sous chef Trevor did an amazing job of whipping up samples of our menu - our family walked away commenting on how good the food was! We weren't able to try all the dishes with our first tasting so they had us come back for a second tasting and Chef Pete made really helpful suggestions for our menu that we ended up going with. Pete is the type of guy who will get things done right and he definitely put us at ease for such a big and meaningful event. Our guests raved about the food and several guests said that it was some of the best food they've had at a wedding. Pete's team finished off the night with delicious churros and lemon curd. We can't thank them enough. Lauren, their director of sales, did a wonderful job with all the details, correspondence, and coordinating with our wedding coordinator. They are reliable, reasonably priced, and most importantly... all the food turned out amazing for 150 people, not an easy feat. We highly recommend Pete and his team for your event!

Pete Coleman is an amazing chef and we were so lucky to be able to have him cater our summer wedding! He also went on a JOURNEY with me and my (now) husband! We booked Pete in earl...

y 2020 for our Fall 2020 wedding. Pete was flexible and understanding when we needed to reschedule our wedding due to COVID-19. We originally planned to do a big wedding, then switched to a family-only dinner, and then last minute were able to go back to our reopened venue and have a dinner for family and friends. Pete rolled with all the changes gracefully–his answer to anything I asked was always “yes, of course” or “yes, here is what we can do”. He was collaborative and communicative and he prepared INCREDIBLE food. We did the California BBQ with a plated salad and buffet dinner–guests raved about everything! The food was delicious, local, gorgeously plated, and everything Pete promised. We truly could not have asked for more; it was perfect. I made sure to eat a bite of everything, and the catering manager, Michael, saved me and my husband a bite of all of the appetizers. All of Pete’s staff–Michael and the servers–were also stand-outs. Fun, easy-going, thoughtful, and true pros - they noticed and corrected things on the go and before I noticed and worried! They truly made the day run smoothly and were authentically kind and caring people. There were one or two miscommunications - we thought we would receive leftovers and didn’t, and we asked for beer and wine to be served before the ceremony and that was missed by the bartender. I would just make sure to clarify if you want something, because Pete truly goes out of his way to provide everything you want and ask for, and we likely didn’t make it clear enough that those were priorities for us. I saw other reviews about Pete’s communication style and, while I see where some of that is coming from, I never felt like Pete was unreachable or distant. On the contrary–he would call me and clarify things or answer any questions I had. He is a true pro and I was never worried about the event because I knew he was handling everything (even if he didn’t explicitly walk me through all the steps he was taking to prepare). I appreciated his direct communication style and transparent pricing and policies. Pete is just a true professional and prepares great food–what more do you need?! I would hire him again in a heartbeat.
