## How to Choose a Spring Mother-of-the-Bride Dress

A mother-of-the-bride dress should reflect the significance of the occasion, embrace the season and complement the wedding party's style. For a spring wedding, mother-of-the-bride dresses that are made of light, airy fabrics (like chiffon and organza) and have vibrant colors and prints (like pastels and florals) are ideal choices. Keep in mind, weather at a spring wedding can vary depending on the location's climate. If you're worried about cooler temperatures, a matching shawl or jacket can be added to your wedding outfit for warmth.
