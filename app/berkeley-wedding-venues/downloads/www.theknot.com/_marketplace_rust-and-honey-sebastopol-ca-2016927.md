About this vendor

We love love. All of the rusty and sweet parts of it. We are a wedding videography duo and couple living in Santa Cruz California. Our passion for wedding films comes from our love of telling stories and our love of connecting with beautiful people. Each couple has a unique story, and we pride ourselves in not simply following the formula, but rather adapting to the unique and personal story each couple carries with them. We shot primarily on vintage lenses, in 4k, in an unobtrusive refined documentary/artistic/natural style. Please reach out, we would love to talk more about your special day! Eli and Kendra (Rust & Honey)

Eli and Kendra are incredibly talented videographers!!!! My husband and I were almost on the fence about hiring videographers for our wedding, and wow, I'm so incredibly happy we d...

Kendra & Eli did the videography for my wedding in June 2019, and I couldn’t recommend them more. The duo was extremely skilled in capturing the most treasured moments of our weddi...

ng day and I found their laid-back but professional demeanor really reassuring and comforting through the whole process of working with them. After watching a few of their other wedding videos, it is clear they also have a really special ability to make a unique video which is authentic to the couple and truly reflects the essence of the wedding day. At the beginning of the wedding planning process, I wasn’t sold on getting a wedding video, but I’m so grateful we did and that we chose Kendra & Eli to be our videographers. The quality of the video they made for my wedding makes it apparent they poured their heart and soul into it, and I couldn’t be more thankful for all of their effort. Best of luck Kendra & Eli, thanks again for everything!

Rust and Honey were absolutely amazing :) Kendra and I had known each other in high school and when I learned she had started making wedding videos I knew we needed to have to film...

our day! Although she and Elijah are young and relatively new to the wedding industry, they are so fantastic! Their videos are not cookie cutter wedding videos. They truly tell the story of the couple. Kendra and Elijah did such a beautiful job capturing the emotions and meaning of our day. They were a joy to work with and did such a wonderful job working to create a video that was unique and stunning. Moreover, they have consistently gone above and beyond to accommodate each of our requests. In our original contract they had offered the raw footage of the whole day, but because couples have been having trouble viewing this footage (it's choppy and disconnected with the audio) they offered us a wonderful opportunity to make a feature length film that included all of the important moments. We are SO incredibly grateful to have been able to share our day with them.

The best part of our wedding day aside from celebrating our marriage itself with those we love was our wedding video. Hands down!! Kendra and Eli went above and FAR beyond the call...

of duty to deliver a product that matched exactly what we were hoping for and SO much more. We watch our highlight video at least weekly (honestly, more like daily!), and the full feature is something that we will cherish forever!! We were able to communicate our ideas/hopes/desires for the videography prior to the day of, and based on our exchanges via phone and email, we had total confidence in them which gave us such peace of mind! They even went so far as to do a quick-cut film for family members who were unable to travel to be with us on our big day... it was done in record time so that we could send it to family the DAY AFTER our wedding. Truly incredible! Their willingness to accommodate us in capturing all aspects of our wedding day is something that we are so extraordinarily grateful for. Their professionalism and reverence in the church setting was appreciated, and they blended in well to the fun, easy-going atmosphere of the reception! We are SO so grateful to have serendipitously come across Kendra and Eli!! We absolutely and wholeheartedly recommend them!

ore perfect wedding video. We met only once before the wedding day and that was exactly what we needed. They’re so easy to work with and I knew the videography was the last thing I’d have to think about on the big day, which was great! Me and my husband definitely recommend Rust and Honey!

magined. We went back and forth on whether or not we were going to even hire a videographer. I am so glad we did. We are able to see and experience parts of our wedding we never would have had we not hired them. They were kind and professional and at times we forgot they were even there. I would, and have already recommended them to friends and family. You will not be disappointed it you hire them. The video is truly something we will cherish forever.
