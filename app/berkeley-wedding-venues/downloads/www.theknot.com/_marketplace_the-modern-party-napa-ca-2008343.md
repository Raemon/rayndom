recommend The Modern Party more! Stephanie was an absolute dream coordinator and truly allowed us to fully enjoy and be present on our wedding day. If there was a problem that came up, we didn't know about it and she and her assistant on the day of handled it. Leading up to the wedding, Stephanie and I had multiple check ins and I was able to text/email her with any questions I have. From how much sheet cake to order to the nitty gritty details and timeline, Stephanie was there to guide us all the way! She was so kind, organized, professional, and we had so much fun working with her!! We had our wedding ceremony at the Capitol Rose Gardens and with that being a public park, there was definitely challenges of dealing with parking, unloading, and ensuring the vendors were able to set up/breakdown and Stephanie was able to handle it all and keep everyone on the schedule with no issues. Stephanie and her assistant set up all of our personal items so beautifully and really made our vision come to life!! 10/10 recommend hiring The Modern Party for your wedding!!! I would hire them all over again!

She connected us with incredible vendors and even solved the complicated transportation logistics for our guests - which seemed nearly impossible. Thanks to Marissa and her outstanding team, our wedding was even better than we'd dreamed - totally unique, elegant, and above all expectations. We would recommend her wholeheartedly to anyone planning a wedding, especially one that seems particularly complicated! We'd jump at the chance to work with Marissa and her team again and we're SO grateful for all of her efforts to make our day the best one ever.

The Modern Party was an absolute dream to work with! We hired Marissa for our Sept 28th 2024 wedding and rehearsal dinner that took place in Nevada/ Tahoe. We are CA residents and...

had always wanted to have a destination wedding but needed it to be close by for family who had trouble traveling distances and budget constraints. My dream wedding was to have it in nature, surrounded by the forest vibe. We cannot thank Marissa enough for making our wedding day everything we had ever dreamed of and more! From the very first consultation, Marissa took the time to truly understand our vision and offered thoughtful advice every step of the way. Especially helped me organize all my inspiration and bounced ideas off me where I was stuck. We used a service called Aisle Planner which was everything I needed to help create mood boards and to help with budgeting tools. This allowed Marissa to follow along and tag team on things with us as the planning unfolded. She helped us navigate every detail with ease, from choosing the perfect venue to managing the logistics on the big day. When life got busy she also gently nudged and reminded us what needed to get done by what due dates. The professionalism, attention to detail, and calm demeanor her and her team brought to the table were unmatched. On the day of Marissa and her team set up all the decor and made sure that our family were able to be present in the day not having to worry about a thing. We were able to relax and enjoy every moment, knowing that Marissa was handling everything seamlessly. Our guests were raving about how smoothly everything went, how beautiful it all was, and what a perfect day that unfolded. We have no clue to this day if anything happened behind the scenes out of the ordinary as everything went off without a hitch. We owe it all to her expertise and dedication. She is so much more than a Wedding Planner, and through this process has become our friend. We had experienced several challenges and setbacks during our 2 year engagement, everything from the unexpected loss of family to the loss of our beloved cat a few months before our wedding. She not only helped us take time to grieve and told us not to worry about anything but also gave us the support we needed when we felt ready to pick back up on planning. She truly supported us like a friend and this is the same to say about each and every vendor she helped us select for our special day. If you're looking for someone who is organized, creative, and truly cares about making your day special, look no further than The Modern Party. Thank you for making our wedding day so magical – we couldn’t have done it without you!

Her meticulous organization and calm demeanor ensured that no detail was overlooked, and her ability to solve any challenge with grace and ease truly set her apart. Whether it was coordinating with vendors, managing timelines, or adding those magical touches that made the day uniquely ours, Marissa went above and beyond at every turn. Thanks to her, we were able to fully enjoy every moment of our wedding day without a single worry. Our guests are still raving about how stunning and flawlessly executed everything was! We feel incredibly lucky to have had Marissa by our side and cannot recommend her enough to anyone looking for a wedding planner who is not only talented but also genuinely invested in making your dreams come true.

y, network in Napa and Sonoma, and great value stuck out to us. Marissa started helping us after we had picked our venue (Carneros Resort) and held our hands every step of the way after that. I can't say my husband or I had a strong idea of what we were envisioning for our wedding but, even with little direction, Marissa went above and beyond and was able to bring our dream to life. She guided us towards vendors who matched our style and personalities and supported us in making decisions that would help us get the most out of our budget. When work and personal life became busy, Marissa helped us stay organized and stress-free while still making progress. With everything design-related, we would've been truly lost without Marissa's guidance and expertise. Throughout planning, she was always available and responsive and helped us make the most out of our limited trips to Napa leading up to the wedding. During our wedding events, Marissa and her team were prompt, organized, and didn't let anything fall through the cracks. They were also so kind, accommodating, and reassuring, which was so important for our families and us! When we look back on our wedding, we feel nothing but happiness and gratitude, and we cannot imagine having gone through planning and our wedding without Marissa!

Their connections with vendors, and also the ability to help curate new ones and tailor details to our needs was pure class. Not to mention, all while helping us stay perfectly in budget. Additionally, staying in budget, and finding solutions to problems, only skyrocketed their creativity -- they proved firsthand how lowering costs did not mean settling for less. All to say, Marissa and The Modern Party perfectly understood our desires and needs, and had the vision to turn them into reality. They are expert planners and we would highly recommend!

Marissa with The Modern Party is, hands down, a rockstar. I don’t know what I would have done without her. She went absolutely above and beyond to help make our wedding and wedding...

day perfect. Marissa set up several venue tours, attended them with me and was extremely knowledgeable about all of them. With her experience in our area, she has worked at most of the top local venues previously, so she knew how each one of works, the pros and cons and was very transparent and honest throughout the search. We ultimately ended up choosing to have our wedding at our own home, which was way more work for us (mainly her) than booking a venue. Marissa provided so many top notch vendor options that fit our style and budget, gave me the space to make my own decisions, and coordinated all of it. The day of our wedding went so smooth, thanks to her coordinating, that I almost couldn’t believe it. I was expecting all the stress and had none. Our wedding turned out absolutely beautiful, better than I could have imagined. Not to mention, we were able to stay BELOW budget without having to eliminate or cut back on anything. If you are trying to find the right planner for your wedding, Marissa is the way to go. I can’t emphasize enough how fantastic and knowledgeable she was and how well she directed the entire process.

It always eased my mind knowing I had someone in my corner helping me and open to answering any questions I had! Stephanie and Nicole were my coordinators for the wedding day and they were absolutely wonderful to work with! I was a little hesitant at first since I had planned most of the wedding with Marissa but Stephanie was able to step in and take over with ease. Stephanie contacted all of my vendors prior to the wedding ensuring all of the arrival times. We spoke many times leading up to the wedding via text, email and over the phone working out every last detail or request I had. The wedding day went smoothly and was planned very well. My husband I were able to fit in everything we wanted and had the best time knowing we had an amazing team handling any issues that may have popped up. I really enjoyed working with everyone at The Modern Party! Thank you again for helping us make our day so special and stress free :) Your team is the best!

In June of 2021, my husband and I hired Marissa from The Modern Party to be our wedding planned for a wedding in May 2022. After a dozen interviews, we knew Marissa was the best pl...

anner for our day. She stood out to us because she was kind, confident, and collected. We wanted a full-service planner to contact vendors, review contracts and design the entire wedding. We had meetings to give her our thoughts and she took that and ran with it. For each aspect of the wedding design, she provided multiple options for us to choose between - from the floral arrangements to the details of napkins and flatware. In the end, she truly took our feedback into consideration and designed a wedding that felt like “us”. Marissa was able to keep us sane throughout the entire planning process. Sometimes we felt overwhelmed with a laundry list of things to do for the wedding but Marissa reassured us that we were ok. She would remind us to take one step at a time and send reminders for us to complete tasks. Behind the scenes, Marissa was communicating with all the vendors to organize when all they would arrive and how the set up will go. We even had a little hiccup with the champagne the day before the wedding so we weren’t going to have a champagne toast. We meant to tell the DJ but forgot. Marissa was the one that informed the DJ to remove that from the schedule and just have everyone toast with their current drinks. On the day of the wedding, Marissa had two assistants to help with her. Her team knew the ins and outs of all the details, they were confident and had everything completely under control. Her team kept our stress levels low and provided updates throughout the day with how set-up was going and showed us pictures of the welcome area and reception hall. When we both walked into the reception hall, we both were amazed at how everything looked. It was transformed into a scene from a wedding magazine – beyond anything we could have imagined. Another thing that we appreciated from Marissa was how inclusive she was. She would use terms like “grooms party” instead of bridal, which made us feel definitely included. Marissa is, without doubt, THE BEST full service wedding planner out there. From start to finish, she was there for us the entire process. Thank you Marissa!!

ist we have a repeat for our 10 year anniversary! Every detail was so meaningfully thought out. When the florist delivered the complete opposite of what I ordered for my bridal bouquet, somehow Stephanie used the bridesmaid’s bouquets and assembled exactly what I pictured with her own hands! Her dedication wasn’t just on the wedding day. She put her heart into every moment of planning, making it more than we could have ever imagined. The day matched our personality and style down to the smallest detail. As a bride living in a different state, I needed someone I could count on. Nobody could have been more perfect. She was so above and beyond it moved me to tears. It’s also worth mentioning that beyond being incredibly good at her job, she is super fun to be around and a very calming presence, which is always so welcome but especially on big days.

Marissa from the Modern Party made planning our wedding extremely stress free. We had to postpone twice due to the pandemic, and Marissa was on top of everything. She communicated ...

with our vendors, coordinated dates that they were available, and made a stressful situation stress-free. I cannot thank her enough! She was always available to us at any time, responded to texts/calls/emails promptly, and really made us feel like we were a priority. She was on top of things during the rehearsal. Even though a few of my party was late and I was worried about having enough time, she maximized who was there and got everyone in position, and ready to roll. When the late wedding party members arrived, they were able to seamlessly jump in and not miss a beat. On the day of the wedding, her and her assistant were on top of it all. We didn't have to worry about anything, and if we did have a question, they were right there to answer it and keep us focused on just us getting married. I cannot recommend The Modern Party enough. If you are looking for a wedding planner, they should be your first call. They made it to where we were able to just show up and focus on enjoying our big day, without worry or stress.

She was always easily reachable, happy to help with any question, and had great ideas and suggestions. She took care of coordinating with all of our vendors, completing and submitting paperwork for our venue, and creating our wedding day timeline.

Our wedding was large and definitely had some complications (some coming up even just a few weeks before the wedding), which were so stressful and crazy -- Marissa handled even the craziest moments with grace and poise and talked us through possible outcomes and solutions. She guided us to the perfect vendors, negotiated prices, and communicated with us and them at every turn. Marissa is creative, solution oriented, and has amazing taste! Marissa and her team worked so hard to make sure our wedding was everything that we wanted -- they went above and beyond, even going so far as to having some of The Modern Party team members hold bubble machines so that the bubbles would reach us as we walked back down the aisle as husband and wife. I said it above, and I'll say it again -- hiring Marissa and The Modern Party was the best decision my husband and I made regarding our wedding (you know, other than the decision to marry one another). I can't recommend her more!!!!
