Samantha

General Manager

Samantha serves as General Manager at The Headquarters, bringing over a decade of experience after starting with Wedgewood Weddings in 2012 at Vellano Estate in Southern California. What she loves about working at Wedgewood Weddings is the friendly coworkers who take pride in their work, the abundant opportunities for internal growth, and how well the company takes care of its employees. Having the ability to have fun while working was particularly important to her when choosing her career path. Samantha credits the company for always treating her well and encouraging her growth while giving her opportunities to advance as she learned and matured. She admires how Wedgewood Weddings takes pride in service and never settles for mediocrity. What energizes her most is thriving in the "chaos" of the wedding industry—she feels she shines brightest when she needs to think quickly on her feet. The mutual respect and belief between Samantha and the company is evident: she believes in Wedgewood Weddings just as much as they believe in her.

We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect experience than the one we had at The Headquarters by Wedgewood. From start to finish, everything was handled with such care, attention to...

detail, and genuine warmth — it truly felt like our day was as special to them as it was to us. The venue itself is absolutely stunning — elegant with beautiful spaces to entertain effortlessly from ceremony to reception. Every corner is picture-perfect, from the lush outdoor areas to the cozy, romantic interiors. We also have to mention our florist, Flover, who brought our vision to life with breathtaking arrangements that matched the venue’s style perfectly. And of course, a massive shoutout to our wedding coordinator, Emma. Emma was an absolute superstar — cheerful, kind, organized, and always one step ahead. She made the entire planning process smooth and stress-free, and on the day itself, she made sure everything ran seamlessly. We can’t thank her enough for helping create such a joyful, love-filled celebration. If you’re looking for a stress-free, all-inclusive wedding venue that delivers on every level — food, style, service, and heart — look no further. The Headquarters truly exceeded every expectation and gave us memories we’ll cherish forever.

Nothing but absolutely great things to say about our Wedgewood wedding at The Headquarters experience! From the friendly and supportive staff, the beautiful venue, and stress free...

experience, we wouldn't change a thing! We were blessed to have Janae and Emma from the very beginning and they made the experience of wedding planning so smooth, and effortless. Definitely experienced and knowledgeable! With me and my now wife being ever so indecisive, they were so patient and supportive throughout the entire process. Their feedback and support made our wedding so intimate and special. They definitely went above and beyond to blow our expectations out of the water. From every aspect of planning colors for charger plates and napkins, to our music list, the grand entrance, accommodating food tasting (since we weren't SoCal locals), they were there one text away every step of the way! Even our banquet captain Nat went above and beyond the night of the event to ensure we were both fed, hydrated and even packed us each a bride and groom's meal to enjoy afterwards. The newly renovated venue was nothing less that spectacular as well! Everything looked amazing from the fixtures and furniture that Wedgewood picked out. Everything looked so elegant and a fun space to enjoy. From the courtyard, main bar, separate bride and groom's rooms to get ready, they were absolutely stunning. All of our guests has nothing but great words to share with the experience and venue. If anyone is considering tying the knot in San Diego, definitely reach out to the Wedgwood team at the Headquarters. They will take care of you and make your event magical!

If there was a Michelin star of wedding venues this would be on the list. We looked at all the venues in town.. Wedgewood at the headquarters was just being built. It looked like...

it might have been out of our budget but we inquired anyway and thank god we did!!! Janae was an absolute dream to work with! She made me feel so comfortable while everything was being finalized. She listened to every concern, took care of every detail, and was always quick to check in and respond. Truly, she was the cherry on top that made the venue experience even more special. The food was incredible—our guests couldn’t stop raving about how delicious and generous the portions were. Our DJ Kyon completely nailed the music! He kept the dance floor alive all night, and everyone had the best time celebrating. Our wedding reception couldn’t have been more perfect. Thank you for making our day so special!

It’s hard to put into words just how magical our wedding day was at The Headquarters by Wedgewood Weddings. From the moment we first visited, we felt something special about this p...

lace, and that feeling only grew as we planned our day with their incredible team. Even though we were only the third wedding ever hosted at this brand-new venue, everything went perfectly. You would have never known how new it was because everything was seamless and exceeded every expectation we had. Emma, our coordinator, was truly the heart behind it all. She was calm, organized, and so thoughtful every step of the way. She guided us through the planning process and made sure the entire day ran smoothly so we could truly relax and soak it all in. Janae and the sales team were also wonderful, answering every question with patience and genuine excitement, which made the whole experience feel easy and enjoyable. On the day itself, the banquet team of Nat, Cody, and Aaron completely blew us away. The food was delicious, the service was flawless, and so many of our guests commented on how cared for they felt. Their kindness and professionalism created such a warm, joyful atmosphere that we will never forget. Our wedding day was everything we dreamed of and so much more. It was joyful, heartfelt, and unforgettable, and we owe so much of that to the amazing team at Wedgewood Weddings. If you’re thinking about hosting your wedding here, do it. Even as one of the very first couples to celebrate at this venue, we felt like we were in the best, most caring hands. It was pure magic from start to finish.

Although our wedding hasn’t happened yet, we couldn’t wait to share how thrilled we’ve been with our experience so far with The Headquarters! From the very beginning, the team has ...

been phenomenal, Taylor and Janae’s professionalism and communication has made the entire process smooth and stress-free thus far. A special shoutout to Taylor, who played a huge role in helping us feel confident about booking a venue still under renovation. Her years of experience with Wedgewood and new venue openings reassured us that their blueprints and mock-ups are always spot-on with the final product—and it’s easy to see that this space is going to be stunning. We were specifically looking for a venue that felt unique and special, something fresh that none of our friends or family had used before. Choosing The Headquarters was a leap of faith, but the team’s attention to detail and their ability to keep us in the loop has us beyond excited for our big day. If you’re considering booking a new venue, don’t hesitate—Taylor, Janae, and the team at The Headquarters will make the process seamless. We can’t wait to see it all come together and celebrate in this beautiful space!
