From my very first inquiry, Victoria was professional, warm, and incredibly organized. During my bridal trial, she completely nailed my request for a soft and natural look—perfect ...

for a bride who doesn’t wear much makeup day to day. On the morning of my wedding, she created such a light and fun getting ready atmosphere, complete with great music and positive energy. Not only did she make me feel beautiful and confident, but she also did an amazing job on all of my bridesmaids and my mom. Our makeup looked flawless from early morning through the very end of the night—even after hours of dancing! Even months later, my bridesmaids are still raving about how great their makeup looked and how beautiful they felt. If you’re looking for a makeup artist who specializes in soft, light, natural romantic looks— Victoria is your girl!

t in her chair, she made me feel so comfortable and cared for. I don’t wear makeup often, and she took the time to listen, make thoughtful recommendations, and create a look that felt like the best version of myself. Victoria was not only professional and skilled, but also incredibly accommodating and kind. She brought such a calming energy to a very special (and sometimes hectic!) day, and I’m so grateful I had her there. My makeup held up all day and night—I genuinely loved how I looked and felt walking down the aisle. Thank you, Victoria, for making me feel so confident and beautiful on one of the most important days of my life. I highly recommend Diamond Rose Salon to anyone looking for a personal, high-quality, and truly enjoyable beauty experience.

If I could give Victoria more than 5 stars, I would. She first did my hair and makeup when I was a bridesmaid in a wedding back in 2016. She then did my hair in another wedding in ...

2022, so I knew I needed her for my wedding in 2023. She helped me bounce around ideas and settle on the perfect Hollywood waves. The trial went fabulous. But then the weather was not in our favor and with wind and rain in the forecast I decided to change my hair last minute. Victoria didn't even bat an eye and kept me calm while we chose another hairstyle that wasn't as structured and was more whimsical to help accommodate the weather. IT CAME OUT EVEN BETTER THAN THE SAMPLE PICTURES!!!! For makeup, I wanted a big, dramatic smokey eye with peachy blushes and full lashes..she hit the nail on the head while still making me look like myself. I had multiple people tell me they loved how she did my makeup so full coverage without me looking like a porcelain barbie doll. Her stylist that accompanied her was also extremely personable, professional, and talented. She got everyone's hair done exactly as they wanted it..literally every girl was ecstatic with their looks! We even finished ahead of schedule. My makeup was done around 1pm and lasted perfect all day even with crying, hugging, tears from being wind blown, sweating when they sun came out.. I only had to reapply my lips a couple times with eating and drinking. My hair also stayed put and looked great ALL DAY through the wind and moisture in the air and never once got poofy. I am beyond thrilled with my wedding day look and I look at pictures now remembering that I seriously had never felt more beautiful in my life. Victoria also has done all my hair appointments for the last few years and has become a great friend. Thanks lady!!
