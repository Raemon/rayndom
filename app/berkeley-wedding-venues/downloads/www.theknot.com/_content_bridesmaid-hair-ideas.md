## Experts Answer Your Bridesmaid Hair Questions

Whether you're seeking advice about picking out the perfect hairstyle or wondering how to prepare before your appointment, we've got you covered. With the help of Wright and Ray, we're answering your biggest bridesmaid's hair questions ahead. If your bestie is still on the lookout for [wedding hairstylists](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/beauty-services), we've got you covered there, too. Head to The Knot Vendor Marketplace to discover pros she'll love.

### How should I choose a bridesmaid hairstyle?

First thing's first: Before you actually choose a bridesmaid hairstyle, it's important to chat with the bride about her vision. "Some brides have a very clear idea of what they want, while others may be more flexible," says Ray. Even if the bride doesn't have any specific wishes, understanding her wedding theme and vibe will help set the tone and guide everyone toward a cohesive aesthetic. "A castle wedding might call for more romantic, structured styles, while a garden or beach wedding may lend itself better to looser, more effortless looks," Ray adds.

Next, think about what you'll be wearing—the neckline of your dress can play a big role in how a hairstyle complements the overall look. "Strapless or off-the-shoulder styles often pair beautifully with loose waves or soft updos, while high necklines tend to work better with elegant updos or sleek ponytails to keep the focus on the dress," says Ray.

Finally, don't forget to be practical. If the wedding is taking place in a hot or humid climate, putting your hair up might be a good idea. "Bridesmaid updos or half-up styles can help prevent frizz, keep hair off the face and neck and ensure the style lasts all day, which is especially important during outdoor ceremonies or summer weddings," says Ray. This also _isn't_ the time to test the waters with something new. "Stick with styles that feel like 'you' to avoid any last-minute disappointment," she adds. "If your hair never holds a curl, it likely won't magically last all day just because it's styled professionally. Be honest about your hair's texture and limitations so we can work with it—not against it."

### What should I do to prepare for my bridesmaid hair appointment?

According to Ray, hair that's been thoroughly washed and dried is the best canvas for a long-lasting, beautiful bridesmaid hairstyle. "Don't fall for the 'second-day hair' myth," she says. "It is not true that dirty hair helps a style last longer. In fact, it can make your hair harder to work with." Unless you plan on getting a blowout, make sure to wash and dry your hair before you start getting ready.

Another important prep step? Gathering inspiration. If you're [paying for hair and makeup](https://www.theknot.com/content/who-pays-for-bridesmaid-hair-makeup), having photos of the bridesmaid hairstyles you like is a great way to ensure that you look and feel great while you're standing by your BFF at the altar. "Take some creative agency and bring together multiple images of looks you love and make it your own by combining elements of your everyday aesthetic along with a more formal or different look," says Wright.

### Find your kind of venue

From barns to ballrooms, discover reception venues that feel like you.

### Should maid-of-honor hairstyles be different?

While the maid of honor can certainly go her own direction, her hairstyle doesn't _have_ to be different from everyone else's. Maids of honor—and bridesmaids, for that matter—should go with a hairstyle that makes them feel confident and jives with their hair type, texture and length. "Most of my brides and bridal parties are choosing different hair, makeup and outfit looks and really embracing individuality," says Wright. To keep things feeling cohesive, brides can offer flexibility within a shared style direction. "Instead of assigning one exact hairstyle to everyone, brides can offer a few options that align with the same theme," says Ray. Maybe that means soft, romantic updos or half-up styles, with each bridesmaid giving it her own spin based on her hair type and length. "This allows individuality while still keeping the group's look consistent and polished."

### How do I find bridesmaid hairstyle inspiration?

Ahead, we're bringing you a roundup of bridesmaid hairstyle inspiration so you can be fully prepared once the big day comes. As you scroll through the inspo photos below, try to find ones that reflect your natural hair color, length and texture. "This helps set realistic expectations and gives your stylist a clear vision of what will work best for your specific hair type, making it easier to achieve a beautiful, flattering look," says Ray. Another professional-approved tip is to sift through red carpet looks for inspiration. "Celebrities often wear modern, elegant styles that work beautifully for weddings and offer a more current, fashion-forward perspective," says Ray.

## The Best Bridesmaid Hairstyles to Inspire Your Look

Ahead, you'll find a roundup of fresh, of-the-moment looksbridesmaids' hairstyles perfect for 2025. The consensus? Minimal and simple bridesmaid hairstyles are having their moment—think half-up ponytails and undone updos. "I'm seeing a lot of bridesmaids embrace hair down or elevate a look that feels authentic to their day-to-day styles," Wright says. Ray's latest work has had a similar vibe. "My recent favorites for bridesmaids are half-up-half-down, messy Pam Anderson updos with face-framing pieces, messy low buns, ponies and soft waves," she says. For all these looks and more, scroll through the list of bridesmaids' hairstyles ahead and bookmark this article for future reference.

If the bride wants relaxed, laidback bridesmaid hairstyles, classic curls with a large-barrel curling iron are a great option.

### 32\. Straight Bob With Bangs

This straight bob with short bangs is one of the easiest bridesmaid hairstyles to achieve, and it looks great with or without a headband.

### 33\. Loose Low Bun With Face-Framing Strands

_[Photo: Stephanie Nelson Makeup & Hair](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/stephanie-nelson-makeup-and-hair-richardson-tx-639954)_

Pull the back half of your hair into a low, loose bun, then incorporate the remaining pieces with bobby pins for a super romantic effect.

### 34\. Romantic Curls

[Curly hairstyles](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-hairstyles-for-curly-hair) work great for long, layered cuts. For an ethereal vibe, use a medium-barrel curling wand.

### 35\. Half-Up-Half-Down Natural Curls

For a sleek touch and lots of practicality, pull your natural curls back into a half-up-half-down style.

### 36\. Simple Low Bun

_[Photo: Beauty Icon NYC](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/beauty-icon-nyc-new-york-ny-2001576)_

If you have fine, limp hair, give it a bit of volume by teasing the top. Then, pull it out of your face and lock it in place with a low, loose bun.

### 37\. Soft Waves With Twisted Front Pieces

![Soft waves with twisted front pieces bridesmaid hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/88fdefd9-690b-427e-ad69-c61405851591~rs_768.h)

_[Photo: Beauty Icon NYC](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/beauty-icon-nyc-new-york-ny-2001576)_

Want soft waves that can withstand hours on the dance floor? Section off a few front pieces, twist them back and secure them with bobby pins.

### 38\. Relaxed Infinity Bun With Face-Framing Pieces

![Relaxed infinity bun with face-framing pieces bridesmaid hairstyle](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/b879722f-e80f-4027-b129-101925fd2af1~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.590.787)

_[Photo: Emily Lynn & Co.](https://www.emilylynnandcompany.com/)_

If you have full, thick hair or plan on bringing some clip-in extensions, try an infinity bun for a unique look.
