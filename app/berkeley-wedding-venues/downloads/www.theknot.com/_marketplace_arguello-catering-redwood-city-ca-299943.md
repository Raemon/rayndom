From the start, Carlos was receptive to our ideas. There were a couple times when we had to show him how we thought it would work, but in the end, we got both the set up and the me...

nu we wanted. He even had us come in the month before the wedding to see both table and buffet set-up in case we wanted to make any changes. On the big day, we were impressed that the food stayed as well as it did despite being served nearly an hour after we had scheduled it (wedding delays - not their fault). The only real snags we hit were placement of a couple tables (the table names got switched on two tables) and their decision to switch our some of the nicer chairs (a long story, but since my mom and I were the main contacts and both obviously preoccupied with the actual ceremony, no one was there to correct). Overall, a great company to use. Tons of options to fit into any budget and a knowledgeable staff to make it all work!
