Nick at Everything Visual was an absolute dream to work with! We booked him last minute after learning a dear family member wouldn’t be able to attend our wedding, and we wanted to...

make sure they could still feel like part of the day. It was such a fortunate find, and we couldn’t be more grateful that Nick was available! As a couple who isn’t usually in front of the camera, it initially felt a little outside our comfort zone. But Nick’s calm and professional demeanor instantly put us at ease. He made the entire experience feel natural and fun, allowing us to truly enjoy the moment while he worked his magic behind the scenes. Nick worked seamlessly alongside our photographer—even though they were separate vendors, they appeared completely in sync. Their collaboration made the day flow effortlessly, ensuring every special moment was captured beautifully. The highlight video Nick created is breathtaking! It perfectly captures the emotion, energy, and beauty of our day. We’ve already started sharing it with friends and family, and the response has been overwhelming—they are all as impressed as we are. We’re also excited to share it on social media, like Instagram, as we figure out the best way to showcase such a beautifully done piece. We can’t wait for others to experience it with us. We’re also thrilled to have the raw footage to look forward to, giving us even more opportunities to relive the day. Nick’s attention to detail and passion for his craft shine in every frame, and we couldn’t be happier with the results. We’d book Nick again in a heartbeat. If you’re looking for someone who will capture your day with artistry and authenticity, Nick is the one to call. Thank you, Nick and team, for creating a keepsake that we and our loved ones will treasure forever!

My video was everything I wanted in a wedding video. I absolutely love it which is why I am rating them a 3. However, think twice about photography. And also their communication i...

s not great. I don’t have one photo of my husband and I just posing together. They are only candid, very few, or with other people. I have very few pictures with family and friends posed too. Almost all pictures are candid. I asked if they could somehow edit ONE of my photos so I could have a photo of just my husband and I posed smiling and they said sure and it has been 8 months since my request. Just be careful, they have charming personalities, but I am so sad about my wedding photos.

Response from Everything Visual on 11/07/2022

Hey, Nina! Great to hear you guys love the video...I think it all turned out really well. ...

You literally said in your last email that you "love the photos so much" – So why this? 1\. I asked you 3 times during the reception to slip out and take some photos with just you two. I won't go into detail here why you guys never did come take photos, but I'm sure you remember. But I did ask several times, and I kinda saw this review coming the day of the wedding because you guys never followed through on my suggestions. 2\. Guest photos – You should have asked that each table take a photo with you since I followed you to every table, taking photos as you went! You saw me many times, standing right there shooting photos as you greeted your guests. Just ask next time! Most people don't want to be disturbed, so we cover it like every other event unless you specifically want a posed photo of all 150 guests. At least you have a picture of every guest, be it candid or not. I edit a lot of other photographer's work and I guarantee you wouldn't recommend against my photography if you saw what the majority of other photographers deliver (that are priced way higher than us, too. lol.) They rarely include everyone in a photo. If it was this important, you guys should have let us know on the questionnaire to formally photograph everyone, or even just mention of it to us the day of. 3\. Photoshopping "one" photo for you – You're asking me to create an entire image that doesn't exist, that we should have gotten the day of! I can do it, but you probably don't know how much time it takes. I felt bad about it, but this wasn't on me! And please don't exaggerate timeline. You made that request a long time after the wedding and never followed up to remind me before posting this. All our email threads were fun and cordial, I know you guys must have talked behind closed doors and then just typed up this review, since this is the first time i'm hearing about most of this, instead of emailing me first. I just don't understand why it was so exaggerated. Things you were just so satisfied with, now you're talking like it's the worst thing in the world on this review! With all the respect in the world, I think it's unfair to review our team poorly for how well it all turned out, really. I'm looking at your gallery right now and I wish my own wedding photos turned out nearly as well as yours did. :/ And the photographer for our wedding prices herself starting at $4,000... We do AWESOME work. I would have been over the moon if our own wedding photos and video turned out as well as yours did. Imagine you paid $4000 for just photos and got half of the photos we delivered to you. THAT would have been disappointing. haha Since it's a public review, here's their wedding gallery if all the rest of you guys want to look at the photos and video for yourselves. http://www.everythingvisualweddings.com/nina-eric-wedding/ Thanks for reading!
