Description

Leyla is a vintage lace wedding dress that makes a bold first impression with her sculpted corset bodice, curve-hugging silhouette, and flirty short hemline. Dainty spaghetti straps and a sweetheart neckline soften the look with a hint of romance, while her dramatic detachable overskirt adds volume and wow factor when the moment calls for it (think ceremony and bridal portraits). Leyla is the ultimate day-to-night transformation without compromising on style.
