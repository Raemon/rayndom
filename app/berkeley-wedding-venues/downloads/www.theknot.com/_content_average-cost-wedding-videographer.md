Whether you're sure about [hiring a wedding videographer](https://www.theknot.com/content/finding-a-good-wedding-videographer) or are on the fence, it's important to know how much wedding videographers cost. While photographers can capture gorgeous stills of your big day, a videographer will help document the touching sound bites and sweet moments you won't want to forget. Videography is the ninth-highest wedding expense, and it's something you might regret not budgeting for after the wedding. According to [The Knot 2025 Real Weddings Study](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-data-insights/real-weddings-study), which surveyed nearly 17,000 newlyweds, 19% of couples wished they had hired a videographer. But, how much is a wedding videographer?

  * How Has the Cost of a Wedding Videographer Changed Over the Years?  




## How Much Is the Average Wedding Videographer Cost?

Based on The Knot Real Weddings Study, the average wedding videographer costs $2,300. This comes in lower than the [average cost of a wedding photographer](https://www.theknot.com/content/average-cost-wedding-photographer), but it's still a worthy expense if you want to relive your wedding day long after you say, "I do." In 2024, 37% of our survey respondents added a videographer to their lineup of wedding vendors.

Our data indicates hiring a wedding videographer could be a generational trend. In 2024, 39% of Millennials hired a pro to film their big day, which is 10% higher than Generation X couples and 2% higher than Gen Z couples.

Additionally, the size of your wedding might be a deciding factor when hiring a videographer. Almost half of all married couples with a guest count of over 100 added one to their lineup of pros, while couples hosting more intimate celebrations were less likely to hire a videographer. With such a memorable and scenic day, it's no surprise that couples are willing to take the extra step to document it.

If you're wondering how much does a videographer cost while doing your vendor search, wedding filming prices depend on the [package you choose](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-video-must-or-maybe). Of course, you're paying for a certain number of hours of coverage on your wedding day, but the post-production editing process is even more time-consuming and costly—which ultimately affects the wedding videographer pricing. While the majority of videographers will produce an edited wedding movie, some offer multiple clips at different lengths (like [videography trends](https://www.theknot.com/content/new-wedding-videography-trends) such as a wedding trailer for social media or a cinematic feature). Others might also be willing to give you the raw footage for your own personal use. All these things affect your ultimate wedding video cost. Always [read your contract thoroughly](https://www.theknot.com/content/a-complete-guide-to-wedding-vendor-contracts) before making any final decisions so you know exactly what you'll get after the wedding day.

Tools like [The Knot Vendor Marketplace](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace) are essential for sourcing your vendors. While some wedding photographers also offer videography services, certain pros specialize only in one area. You might be able to lower your wedding videography cost by finding a vendor who does both services in a discounted package. Or, if you're in the market for a videographer with a specific shooting style, like cinematic or documentary, it may be worth doing more research to find someone who fits your vision.

It's important to have open communication with your pro regarding the [type of video](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-video-styles) you want. Because there are so many video shooting styles, take the time to watch couples' wedding films on social media (and check out your desired vendor's examples) to make a list of the important moments you want to have captured. Clips of your wedding ceremony and reception are a must—but also consider behind-the-scenes shots you'll want to relive, like [getting ready with your VIPs](https://www.theknot.com/content/getting-ready-the-morning-of-your-wedding-tips), and other wedding-related events like your rehearsal dinner. Whether you want the cake-cutting ceremony or full wedding party speeches filmed, work with your vendor to build a shot list that fits your needs. Or, if you're not sure what you want for your wedding video, allow your videographer to help guide the final product. (They are the experts, after all.) Since a wedding videographer is a valuable investment, you'll want to take the time to make sure the final product is what you and your partner want.

## How Has the Cost of a Wedding Videographer Changed Over the Years?

The average cost of a wedding videographer remained consistent from 2023 to 2024, though it increased by $200 in both 2021 and 2022, averaging $1,900 and $2,100 respectively. Keep in mind that the average price for a wedding videographer is just that—an average. (Unfortunately, there's no one-size-fits-all answer for how much videographers charge.) Rates will change based on your location, the number of hours the pro (or pros, if there's a second shooter) will be working and the kind of wedding videography package you select. 

How much a wedding videographer costs isn't necessarily inexpensive, but many couples find hiring one is worth capturing the best moments of their special day. After all, you'll be busy enjoying the day and won't be able to see and hear everything, but your videographer will be there to ensure your wedding day is archived forever. If your [wedding budget](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-budget-ways-to-save-money) allows, a videographer is a great addition to your vendor list, which results in a beautiful wedding keepsake.
