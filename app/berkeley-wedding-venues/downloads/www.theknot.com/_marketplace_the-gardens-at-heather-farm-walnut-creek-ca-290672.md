We could not have asked for a more perfect venue for our wedding. Even on the last day of August, the gardens were in full bloom. We received SO many compliments from our guests on...

how stunning the venue was. Everyone we worked with at The Gardens at Heather Farm was kind, attentive, and an excellent communicator. Jenna and Cathleen were both so amazing! Throughout the planning process, they were always available to answer questions and offered many helpful recommendations for vendors, which made our planning much smoother. We dreamed of having an outdoor ceremony and cocktail hour, followed by an indoor reception, and this venue was absolutely perfect for that. As an LGBTQ+ couple, we felt valued and respected, which was also very important to us. Our wedding day completely exceeded our expectations, and we had so much fun! I cannot recommend The Gardens at Heather Farm enough. It was truly the most magical place to host a wedding.

We got married in late July at The Gardens at Heather Farm Park, and it was truly the most perfect day. This venue holds such a special place in our hearts. My husband asked me to ...

be his girlfriend under the gazebo years ago, and later proposed under the same gazebo. Choosing to get married where it all began was a complete no-brainer. We had a ceremony-only wedding, and the gardens were absolutely breathtaking. Every flower was fully bloomed, the grounds were stunning, and the atmosphere felt magical. So many of our guests, especially those visiting from outside Walnut Creek and neighboring cities, could not stop complimenting the venue. Many even took time to wander the gardens and take their own photos because it was just that beautiful. I cannot say enough good things about Cathleen and the entire GHF team. They were incredible to work with and made everything feel seamless and stress-free. The weather was perfect, the venue was perfect, and honestly, everything was perfect. It was truly the best day of my life, and I will forever be grateful that we were able to say I do in such a meaningful and beautiful place.

Oh where do we even begin? The Gardens at Heather Farm is breathtakingly gorgeous and perfect for our Peonies and Poppies themed, outdoor, garden wedding (peonies and poppies are o...

ur favorite flowers). Our guests were singing praises about the beauty of the Gardens at Heather Farm. One guest even mused that her garden wedding venue wasn’t as vast and beautiful as the Gardens at Heather Farm. The sunset and golden hour lighting at this garden is oh so majestic and beautiful. Our wedding photos turned out stunning! The roses, the gazebo backdrop and the lush greenery of the gardens, you really don’t need to spend a lot on decor to decorate the place, it is already beautiful on its own. The gardens and the roses were regularly maintained by volunteers and workers so they are always in tip top shape! We decided to go with the Gardens at Heather Farm for various, multiple reasons: 1\. We loved that there is an indoor hall for us to host our reception. The Camellia Room is a white blank space, perfect for us to decorate to our hearts desire. You can customize it to any color and theme that you want and it will not clash with the interior. We decided to go with a muted orange and pink, disco balls, fun games themed wedding and it turned out amazing! There is a huge window that lets in plenty of natural lighting that looks good in pictures. 2\. The Gardens at Heather Farm coordinator, Jenna was a dream to work with. She replies to our emails promptly and answers all of the questions we have, even the ridiculous ones like “are there any trash cans on site?” She is professional, easy to work with and amazing! She is constantly on top of everything and makes you and your wedding feel important. 3\. We love that the venue allows outside catering options (with a $1,000 extra fee), we toured a bunch of venues and most require us to use their preferred catering options. We fell in love with an outside caterer and was able to have them for our wedding 4\. The venue provides chairs for the ceremony area, high tables for the cocktail hour and chairs and tables for the reception which are convenient to have. Chair and table rentals can be expensive! 5\. The gardens being a public place means that we have the option to come and visit whenever we want, especially on our anniversaries. We also didn’t have any problems with random strangers wandering into the wedding considering it’s a public space. 6\. No loud music curfew, we wanted to party and dance! Wheelchair accessible and friendly which was a necessity for my grandmother 7\. Tons of parking spaces for our guests. It was also reserved for us when there was a festival held in Heather Farms Park. We unknowingly book our wedding date during the infamous annual Walnut Festival in the Heather Farms, where the gardens are located, usually on the weekend of Sept 20th-ish. You can hear the music played during the festival but it didn’t bother us because we were having the best day of our lives. 8\. There is an option to book the Rose Room which works as a getting ready place for our outfits changes All in all, the Gardens at Heather Farm was a great find and is a beautiful and amazing wedding venue. We highly recommend it for anyone who is planning their wedding!

My now husband and I just got married here this June, and it was the best day of our lives! From the start, Jenna here at the Gardens at Heather Farm was amazing to work with. We s...

imply walked in on a random day and she gave an impromptu tour and info session. After this, I knew this was the venue where we wanted to get married. Initially we had to look into the later summer months due to availability, but there was a cancellation and Jenna immediately let us know for booking our perfect June date! I'd definitely recommend booking earlier than later as to ensure the best date for you. Jenna was also super responsive to any and all questions we had leading up to our wedding date, responding so promptly every time! This really made us feel at ease knowing we weren't alone. The Gardens have an unmatched natural beauty with all the foliage and flowers there. The gazebo ceremony area is a romantic setting for the ceremony, the outdoor bar area was perfect for cocktail hour, and the newly renovated indoor hall with wrap around deck was a great size for reception. Our guests loved having the ability to walk around and enjoy the beauty here. For us, it was all around such a wonderful experience for our special day. I'd highly recommend this venue to any other couple getting married!

ndations throughout the entire planning process. The venue has a required catering list, but everything else was up to us, allowing for plenty of creative freedom. The volunteers who work on the property keep it in pristine condition, and their dedication truly shows. Even in November, the gardens were full of beautiful roses, creating the perfect backdrop for our special day. The venue itself is DIY, but the outdoor setting speaks for itself, which was exactly what we were looking for. I love DIY projects and had so much fun putting our wedding together, and the natural beauty of the gardens made everything come together seamlessly. The day went off without a hitch, and we’re so grateful for choosing this venue for our celebration.

After looking at many potential venues for our wedding this October, we decided to go with The Gardens at Heather Farms, and boy are we glad we did! This venue has a beautiful gard...

en backdrop and an elegant Gazebo for the ceremony, an upper patio area with additional garden beds for happy hour, several great private areas for personal vows, an additional room for the wedding party to hang out in as the guests start to arrive, and a building for the reception to be held in, all within a single property that is entirely accessible even for those with mobility issues. The fact that The Gardens is a non-profit also makes them one of the more reasonably priced options in the area for a medium sized wedding. After a Zoom consultation with Jenna where we discussed their amenities and available and our approximate wedding plans at the time, we scheduled a time to have a guided venue tour, and somehow the pictures do not do it justice! The grounds were pristine, plants extremely well kept, and the Camellia Room was recently re-done giving it a brighter look. The Gardens at Heather Farms had all of the chairs and tables we needed for our event, provided us with options for floor plans for the ceremony and reception, and they even recommended the wedding coordinator that we decided to hire. We were able to have the wedding rehearsal on-site the day before the wedding. If you are in the area and are looking for something to do (even if that something is not “host or attend a wedding”), I would highly recommend stopping by. As long as there is not a private event going on, the gardens are free to tour, and there are tons of different flowers, plants, and fruit trees to experience. They even have painting classes, volunteer opportunities, and they sell plants!

My daughter and her fiancé chose The Gardens at Heather Farm for their June wedding and it was everything our families could have wished for. The Venue is exceptional. The entire g...

arden was privatized for the event. The ceremony at the Gazebo in the rose garden was picture-perfect. The location is unique and the lovely Gazebo surrounded by hundreds and hundreds of roses in full bloom was the perfect backdrop for their special moment. Cocktail hour was at the patio Pavilion – a large “U” shaped bar with granite countertops and covered by a vine-covered wooden pergola. It sits next to a raised bed garden space filled with flowers which provided a pleasant place for our guests to mingle and enjoy the beautiful flowers while enjoying their cocktails. Dinner was indoors in the Camellia Room. This room is stunning. Huge glass windows around the room provide views of the garden and the lovely lake. The neutral colors in the room were perfect for our summer wildflower color theme. There is a large deck that runs around the outside of the space which was perfect for an outdoor bar, photo booth, and our audio guest book (phone). The Gardens provided an amazing array of beautiful places for photography and spaces for our guests to stroll and enjoy the views. The indoor space was lovely, clean, and bright. Lots of space for seating, a DJ, a cake table, a Sweetheart Table, and dancing. The Gardens staff was extremely helpful and responsive during the entire process. We would choose this venue again in a heartbeat.

decor. I would book again in a heart beat! The downsides: you can only access the venue at 2pm on your wedding day and have to take everything home by 12am that night. I was originally nervous about this part of things, but I felt like it was ultimately completely fine and allowed enough time for my planner to set up and take everything down. They also highly encourage you to use an on-list caterer, but again, we don't regret this at all even though we were initially nervous about it. We used Havana, and they were amazing!

We booked the gardens in mid May for our wedding and it was a gorgeous wedding venue! It offers a spacious, beautiful garden teeming with blooming roses, different garden areas to ...

explore, a super cute gazebo ceremony space, a nice cocktail area near the reception room, and the reception room with large windows for plenty of natural light. The lot has ~50 free parking spaces. The rental rate is fairly reasonable for the venue space and what's offered. In addition to the main spaces, there's a getting ready room downstairs available to add on, seating for the ceremony, circle/rectangular (not full width) tables for dinner, and a few cocktail tables for the bar area downstairs. Management allows for a fair amount of DIYing and independent vendor selections, with the only exceptions being a preferred catering list with good selection and off list caterers allowed with a fee and vetting. Professionals also must put up any hanging decorations in the reception room, and decor can't be hung directly off of the garden structures and reception room walls. We communicated with Jenna throughout the planning process. She was super responsive and helpful, answering every question we sent her way. Overall, I loved the gardens for our wedding and would recommend it to others!

After we booked the venue and paid our deposit, they informed us that the indoor space would not be available for our reception due to pipe burst, so we had to scramble to find a new venue for the reception. Of course, the pipe burst was unforeseen and we appreciate the challenges that it created for them; however, it is what happened after that really gave us a negative opinion. They said they could re-book us for June-July 2023 because they would 100% be done with repairs by then. We later learned that they have not even started repairs in Feb 2023! The pipe burst happened in September 2022! They repeatedly kept telling us that the whole building is completely ruined due to the flood and there is not even the smallest broom closet that they could lend to us for a few hours for a bridal getting-ready room. Instead they kindly offered us a dingy-looking outdoor camping tent that we could use to our heart’s desire in 40-degree weather. However, the day of the wedding, we saw people working in their offices as normal inside the building! GHF has a flabbergasting chair policy. According to their contract, they can refuse to set up their outdoor chairs if the conditions are “wet”. Already this is a weird stipulation since they just have regular run-of-the-mill wooden chairs, not anything remotely fancy. But the real kicker is that apparently they get to make the call about what is considered “wet”, and their definition is apparently “if it rained even a tiny bit a day before and is not actually raining during the ceremony”. Nowhere in the contract is this actually spelled out. They left us scrambling to find another chair vendor (who luckily did not have issues putting their chairs in the rain). They then refused to set up these RENTED chairs despite the fact that they are identical to the chairs that they would have put out themselves had it not rained the night before. Again, this detail was not in the contract. In the end, this resulted in us spending a very large sum to rent and set up chairs despite the fact that it was not actually raining during the ceremony or for several hours prior. Due to these circumstances, we would not recommend GHF for a wedding in the near future.

My husband and I had our wedding last July and we are so happy and thankful that it was at the Gardens at Heather Farm. We first booked them in 2019, for a 2020 wedding. The Garden...

s was understanding and helpful when we had to postpone twice due to COVID. In the months leading up to the wedding, we emailed with Natalie Dilibero, the Operations Assistant, and she was just so quick, compassionate, and sweet. If you're seeing this, Natalie, we appreciate you so much! There are the most roses in May but the Gardens was gorgeous in early July, with many, many roses in bloom, making for truly incredible photos. We did get our florist (Sweetness & Light) to make ground arrangements for the gazebo to add more color to the ceremony area and think it was a great decision! However, it's also beautiful without decoration. There are also PLENTY of other gorgeous plants throughout the Garden. The terrace area is mostly shaded and perfect for cocktail hour. I appreciate how the flow from the ceremony site to the terrace to the indoor hall is straightforward. The indoor reception hall, Camellia Hall, is also great with minimal decoration. We love the big windows and the high ceiling, and personally thought adding string lights were just enough. But many couples seem to add draping and other lighting. The point is that the space is classy on its own, and is versatile so it can be dressed up as much as one chooses. The hall has AC, but we decided to turn it off and have the doors and windows open later in the reception for more ventilation (unfortunately only a couple windows open, but there are doors on all sides of the hall), and it didn't feel too hot. Additionally, the rates are reasonable, there is ample parking, and you get to support a non-profit, educational garden. The day-of staff were cool with masking during the wedding and testing before (we dropped off rapid tests the day before the wedding). What is not to love?

We originally booked the Gardens for October 2020, but due to Covid needed to reschedule. The venue was very gracious and found us a new date with no issues regarding payment. All ...

the coordinators we communicated with were wonderful about responding to any questions we had. My husband and I along with our guests. felt very safe with their Covid guidelines As luck would have it our new wedding date was the Sunday of intense rain so all of our outdoors planned had to be scrapped and everything moved inside. The venue was helpful with making suggestions about the ceremony and where things could be placed in regards to decor. A big thanks to the venue for being such a big part of our day!

Pros: Beautiful location! We got married in May and the flowers were all blooming which led to wonderful photos, especially at the gazebo. The weather was perfect. I love how this ...

venue has an outdoor area for the ceremony/cocktail hour, and a nice indoor space for the evening. The view of the park and water is really nice. Cons: We knew this going in, but there is a large park next door. We rented out the large picnic area to try to decrease noice, but there were large parties going on during the wedding so people were watching the wedding (totally fine with us!) and there was some music playing that I could hear during the ceremony. It is a community garden so not everything was perfectly groomed, but still lovely. My largest complaint is how strict this location is. They only provide the venue but have a lot of rules (no throwing things on the grounds, no dropping things off early/late, specific times people are allowed in the garden area, specific caterer list) which we knew ahead of time so we made it all work. We got married amongst COVID which threw a wrench in a lot of things, but it was frustrating having to fight with the venue (Rebecca) on a rules once we got close to the date. California already had some of the most strict rules of any state (we provided proof to the venue that every single guest was fully vaccinated or tested), and then the venue was adding on their own additional protocols to "discourage onlookers from being suspect that our event activities are risky"....Rebecca was otherwise great to work with, but once it came to COVID guidelines it felt like I was fighting to have the wedding we had paid to have, and she did not feel very warm on the day of the wedding either. Which is less than ideal when she had to check every guest in. COVID was a stressful time though, so I am sure the majority of my issues will not be a problem in the future. Overall, I am glad we chose this venue for our wedding and as long as you can be flexible, it is a beautiful place to get married!

eekends had already started filling. Jen and Rebecca were very responsive via email to all our questions about venue specifications and vendor recommendations. GHF is a very beautiful, natural venue; but the best time to be at the gardens is definitely when all the roses have started blooming in the Spring/Summer. If you’re looking for a venue that has very romantic, simple, natural, garden vibes— this is the place to book. They are one of the most affordable venues in the bay area that has a space for an outdoor ceremony, a cocktail hour, and an indoor reception. The reception area is also just a beautiful canvas to DIY decorations-wise. And if choosing to do the ceremony in the gazebo area— you can definitely save on ceremony flowers when the roses are in bloom! When COVID hit, due to the lockdown, we had to postpone/cancel our big wedding. After rescheduling twice, we were finally able to have an intimate outdoor ceremony there a year later from the original date, and we’re just so grateful that GHF was flexible at the time and able to accommodate us. On the day of, our attendant Lauren made sure we had everything we need, made sure no one else that was not there for the wedding was lingering in the gardens for our ceremony, and was just so professional and easy to work with that day. I’m also so so glad we were also around for when all the flowers were finally in bloom. Thank you again Rebecca and team!

I was looking for an outdoor ceremony with indoor reception venue and was on a budget. I finally came across the Gardens at Heather Farms and it was everything I was looking for. ...

We booked the Gardens in January and then Covid19 happened. We waited as much as we could to see if we would be able to have our wedding safely and ultimately decided in September to reduce it down to ceremony only. Rebecca checked in with us and gave us options to rebook/or adjust down to ceremony only and they refunded us for adjusting down to ceremony only as well which was very kind of them. The Gardens are absolutely gorgeous and the roses were in full bloom even in early November during our ceremony. They close down the Gardens for their events so we had it all to ourselves. It was peaceful and beautiful and we got so many compliments on the ceremony. They are particular about time as well as no bird seeds / petals etc if that matters to you. We ended up booking a 4 hour ceremony slot to accomodate decorating and setup. The Reception room is plain but rustic- a DIY/creative's dream space which is what I was really looking forward to so I'm a little sad we weren't able to utilize it. So much potential ! They also gave us an hour the day before to have a rehearsal. I wish the coordination there was a tad bit better because we seemed to have overlapped some of the time with another party but not a terrible big deal. For the price and location you can't beat the Gardens especially if your guest count is more intimate. I honestly would love to have other events here and cannot recommend them more. They book up quick so definitely head over to their website and check their calendar of events. seriously ...get married here !

we saw and to be honest, we didn't really looked somewhere else anymore because the pictures of this place online were all pretty.

The ambiance was very romantic and serene which are perfect for our wedding. Rebecca helped us and toured us around the place and she was very helpful and knowledgeable. She was suggesting a lot of things which gave us ideas on what we should do on our wedding day. We Did our ceremony at the gazebo and the reception at the Camella hall. Our guests were all saying that our venue was so beautiful which proves that we made the right choice. We love the Gardens and we highly recommend it!

to the stunning backdrop, this is the perfect place to start the rest of your lives together. We didn’t live in Walnut Creek when we booked the venue and Rebecca spoke to us on the phone for about an hour easing any concern and answering every question we had with kindness and care. She was so on top of communication and every detail we hadn’t considered. She even recommended a phenomenal florist for us (Sweetness and Light), based on my personality, who we simply adored.. The Gardens at Heather Farms is one of the most stunning places I have ever seen, with an exceptional staff, and a gorgeous venue, this is hands down one of the best affordable and elegant Bay Area finds.

The space was beautiful! We got married mid-May, so the rose gardens were in FULL bloom. They made for the most beautiful pictures. The space is strictly a space rental, no vendors...

are included. They so provide a preferred vendor list, and we found our caterer through their recommendation. We had about 90 guests, and we fit pretty comfortably, with enough room for a dance space. I really wouldn't recommend any more than 100 people for a wedding here. Additionally, the space is very private, and the time you are given within the space is very reasonable to hold an event. However, they do have a strict 12am out time. Or you get charged. It can make you feel rather rushed by having to clean up in the end.

the gardens, and could tell that it would be really stunning when everything was in bloom. We worked with Kelly from the start, and she was super helpful answering our questions, showing us photos from different seasons, and suggesting vendors. Both she and Rebecca were extremely prompt answering emails and made the whole process much easier. We picked a lot of vendors from their suggested list and I'd definitely recommend doing the same; the caterer, DJ, and decoration company knew the venue so well and worked seamlessly together. The gazebo and rose garden are really lovely for the ceremony and photos, and it was wonderful having a cocktail hour on the patio before moving up to dinner in the reception room. The room looks a little bland on it's own, but I couldn't believe how it transformed once all the tables and decorations were set up. It's sort of like a blank canvas, so you can dress the room up however you like. Planning a wedding can be stressful, but I feel like ours was much easier than it could have been, in large part thanks to the venue we chose.

I held my wedding here at the end of April, and the garden was absolutely beautiful. The roses were in bloom, the weather was warm (but not hot) and there was plenty of space for g...

uests to explore and enjoy. The inside room is a bit small, and can look kind of like a multipurpose room. The vendor they let us use to drape the ceiling made a huge difference. Heather Farm let us split the cost of taking down the pictures with the couple that were married the day before us. I agreed to do it before really looking at the pictures, and in hindsight I would have left them up. They are very my style, but I don't think most people would want to leave them up. There is a randomly shaped set of cubbies above the gift table, so be sure to take note of the measurements when planning your decorations! The small staff that runs the garden was helpful and replied to my questions promptly. This is not a full service venue, and since I didn't have a wedding planner, I had a lot of questions. There was one issue on the day of event- David, the guy employed by HF to set up, was not scheduled to arrive early enough for our rental time, and the DJ and caterer were left waiting outside. As soon as the venue was unlocked, David and the rest of the vendors kicked into high gear. Everything was set up on time, our guests never knew. HF refunded the money I had paid for an extra hour without any fuss. This was an unfortunate hiccup, but the way they handled it left me without much to complain about. Overall, I loved the blooming flowers in the gardens and was very happy with my wedding.

I never had any problem getting ahold of either Tracey or Tyler. \- they provide and set up any tables you might need, as well as chairs (if you want to use their ugly ones- see con below). Cons: \- They are very particular and have their rules. The one I was frustrated with is that you can't use the white folding chairs used for the ceremony for the reception, because they won't allow them to be around food. The chairs they provided for the reception are hideous conference chairs that look like they're straight out of the '80s, so we had to pay $500 to rent the exact same chairs they provided us for the ceremony to use at the reception. You also can't use birdseed, flower petals, etc, which is frustrating to some, but it seems like most outdoor venues have these rules. Overall I would definitely recommend this venue! Our wedding was 2 weeks ago and we already got our deposit back in the mail.
