## What Is Flatware? 

Most people use flatware as another word for silverware. Flatware is a general term that's used to refer to the utensils we use to eat a meal—knives, forks, spoons and other niche utensils (such as an oyster fork, soup spoon or demitasse spoon), Hayes says. It can be made from any material: silver, stainless steel, plastic or wood. Most everyday flatware is stainless steel, which doesn't rust, tarnish, chip or wear out. The best grades are 18/8 and 18/10, which are designations that indicate the ratio of chromium to nickel. What is 18/0 stainless flatware? This budget-friendly option contains no nickel, which means it's less durable and is more prone to rust and staining. 

### What Is the Best Weight for Flatware? 

Flatware is generally divided into five weight categories, ranging from budget to high quality. "Weight is something we don't often think about when considering flatware, but flatware that is too light can feel flimsy in our hand, and results in a more awkward user experience," Hayes indicates. 

Weightier flatware tends to feel like an extension of our hand, making it easier and more natural to use, Hayes says. It can also feel more luxurious, making it suitable for special occasions. But flatware that's too heavy can feel clunky and awkward, too. While it may be acceptable for a special occasion, it's generally not preferred for everyday use.

Hayes offers a quick breakdown of the different flatware weights you'll find while shopping:

  * **Extra lightweight:** Less than 2mm—Low quality/budget 
  * **Lightweight:** 2.2mm—Good 
  * **Medium weight:** 2.5mm—Better 
  * **Heavyweight:** 3-3.5mm—High/Luxury (Best) 
  * **Super heavyweight:** greater than 4mm plus—Specialty



## What Is Silverware? 

When the term silverware is used correctly, it refers to flatware that's made of at least 92.5% pure silver. Today, for the purpose of mass production, most types of silverware are silver-plated, which means they're dipped in a silver coating, rather than being made of silver throughout. 

A layer of 100% silver coats another metal, usually nickel or brass. Nickel is best, because it's harder than brass and silver adheres to it well. The thicker the silver layer, the better the quality. Silver-plated flatware is a dishwasher-safe, less-expensive alternative to sterling that often lasts nearly as long. 

## What Is Flatware vs. Silverware?

Cutlery and flatware are both terms that commonly refer to the utensils we use every day in our table settings. Silverware, on the other hand (when used correctly rather than colloquially), is specific to items made of or plated with silver. This often means eating utensils, but "silverware" could also be cups, plates, bowls, serving platters or any other tableware that is made of, or plated, with silver.

To clarify, Hayes provides the following example to explain the silverware meaning versus more general terms: "A knife/fork/spoon set that is coated with silver could be called 'silverware' or 'cutlery' or 'flatware'. But a knife/fork/spoon/set made from stainless steel could only be called flatware or cutlery."

Now that you have clarity on flatware versus silverware [wedding registry etiquette](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-registry-etiquette), we'll briefly discuss the different settings you can choose from to add to your registry:
