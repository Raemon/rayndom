SCAM--STAY AWAY We were excited by the price and choices available through Basic Catering and decided to go with them for our wedding. When Danny became unresponsive to my emails,...

we decided to pull out of our contract within the allowed time to get a full refund. Danny said that the cancellation was fine and he would give us our refund, but then proceeded to lie to me (I would call and he would say he was "just about to email me" and of course never did--this happened multiple times over the course of 4 weeks) and then he eventually ghosted me completely. Luckily, our credit card company settled the dispute (it took 3 months for us to get $10k back... it was a very stressful experience before our wedding). I think we would've had to go to court if our credit card company hadn't taken care of it. Here are some red flags to look out for in retrospect: 1) NEVER PAY IN FULL UPFRONT FOR CATERING. THIS IS NOT NORMAL. We ended up paying almost $10k to Danny and his team up front because we didn't know any better, but now you do! The catering company we went with after this only required payment AFTER service. 2) NEVER PAY FOR LARGE PURCHASES WITHOUT YOUR CREDIT CARD. I never thought I'd love Citi Bank so much, but they were able to help immensely. After reading other reviews, I wonder how much of Danny's business is based on taking a bunch of money from people upfront to pay off his previous issues/lawsuits... make sure to protect yourself by paying through a credit card. In short--screw Basic Catering. Other places are much more responsive and professional. All they did was add unnecessary stress during our wedding planning period.

STAY AWAY AT ALL COSTS!!! My experience with Basic Catering has been a complete nightmare. I initially started correspondance with Jennifer from Basic Catering in June of 2023 ab...

out providing catering for my wedding reception in April. We worked together to revise and refine the menu. Once we were happy with the menu, we wanted to book a tasting before committing to using their services. They required us to PAY IN FULL to simply book a tasting "per their policy". We were told that if after the tasting we decided to not go with Basic Catering, we would be fully refunded minus 15% of our quoted fee. That 15% would pay for the tasting. My fiance and I thought this was strange but we looked past it. In hindsight, that was the first of many red flags. We picked a date for the tasting and were ready to pay with our credit card. We were told that our only options for payment were Venmo and PayPal. We decided to go with PayPal and I was sent 9 payment request links and my fiance was sent 3 links all in one day. We tried to complete a transaction and it said "pending" on our end. Basic Catering then refunded that money and said Paypal wasn't working on their end and we had to go through Venmo or Zelle. Frustrated with all the back and forth, we agreed to pay on Venmo and we had to pay the 3% credit card fee ourselves. We later found a payment portal via stripe on the proposal that was never given to us as an option for payment. We unfortunately had to reschedule our first tasting date, which was completely on us. We scheduled to another date, now in November, which was confirmed by Basic Catering. I emailed Jennifer the day before our appointment to confirm our tasting for the following day. She responded that the chef had a death in the family and had to reschedule. Now, I understand that things come up, and I would not expect them to continue with work after a family emergency like that. But to not say anything feels very unprofessional in my opinion. At this point, my fiance and I finally decided there had been too many issues and we needed to find a different caterer. As soon as I reached out for a full refund in late December, I was completely ghosted. The phone numbers on their website and Jennifer's email signature would not go through at all. No ring, no voicemail- just call failed. I finally emailed Jennifer, Danny (the chef), and the owner, Mr. Harbor, threatening to move forward with legal action if I did not receive a refund/hear from them. I got an email response and call within the hour from Danny. He said that they just came back from holiday and Jennifer had left the company but that he would be my new contact from now on as we move forward. I made it VERY CLEAR in my email that I wanted nothing more to do with this company and reiterated that on the phone. That was on 1/3. As of today, 1/8, we have not received a refund and have heard nothing. I have sent all of our correspondence and information to our lawyer and we will be proceeding with a lawsuit to get our money.

On September 16, 2023, this company destroyed my daughter's reception. They ignored me as soon as I started to complain, causing me to sue. He had texted a week before court askin...

g me that if I removed my Yelp review, we can discuss the refund. In court, he acknowledged the mistakes and agreed to pay. I ultimately removed my review because I thought he would stand up and do the right thing. I think removing my review was a mistake. If Mr. HARBOR actually cared, he would put a stop to this behavior. He told the judge that he will talk to his staff. Apparently, it fell on deaf ears. Since then, 2 people posted a bad review and now their reviews disappeared. I ask you, two negative reviews magically disappeared over night? How does one go from they ruined a wedding reception to deleting one day after their review. I am sure Yelp's web activity shows the account internet activity, should a subpoena be issued. This company should no longer be allowed to continue to ruin one of the most important celebrations in one's life. He did it to my daughter. I now doubt he will pay the judgment. I think this isn't an honest company because their advertisement was nothing like the food that was delivered. My food arrived in two deliveries 2.5 hours apart and had food I didn't order and food that I had ordered. The chicken was enedible. I had texted him a screen shot of another review and he literally didn't care and said things happen in this industry. Apparently, it happens a lot with Basic Catering. In my situation, I noticed that my money was deposited into another business. Maybe the money you paid wasn't used to actually cater your event. I would check into this. Which company did you actually authorize payment and what does your bank statement show? My money went into LF Family LLC, which is a consulting company.
