Planning a wedding is stressful and expensive. All of our friends have had bad experiences with wedding coordinators/assistants while also paying an arm and a leg, so we felt nervo...

us and in the dark when looking for something for ourselves. 2 Friends was by far one of the most affordable options out there and had high reviews, so we decided to give them a shot. We didn't need any help with planning, but just wanted someone to help make sure the day itself didn't go off the rails, so we went with the wedding assistant package (this is basically what we thought a day of coordinator was anyway). I'll be honest that I didn't think we even needed someone in this role, but my partner was insistent. She was right that we did need someone, and our assistant Winnie was stellar, incredible, awesome, (insert all other positive adjectives here). We had a large wedding (200 people) with complex moving parts (combined Indian and western traditions) that might throw some people off their game. While I don't think we gave Winnie the easiest wedding to handle, she did everything so well. She helped gather people in the right place for our Baraat (dancing Indian wedding procession), helped adjust the schedule when things inevitably got a little delayed, was running back and forth coordinating between the venue, our parents, and other important points of contact, and also frequently checked in with us to see how we were doing and to make sure we had glasses of wine when we needed them.

When my flowers were wet and needed to be held by someone for a little bit before my ceremony, Carissa used her own sweater to hold my bouquet. A true master in her art and any couple would be lucky to work with her!

nth-of package. 2 Friends Events was super flexible and accommodating with this, and pricing was transparent throughout. We are so glad we went with the month-of coordination. Carissa in particular was such a joy to work with. We had so many random questions about every aspect of the wedding leading up to the day, and Carissa answered them all with such patience and timeliness. She communicated consistently with us and our vendors to make sure everyone was on the same page, and if there was anything we were forgetting to consider, Carissa made sure to raise it with us. Our rehearsal and day-of went super smoothly with her as well! She made sure we were running on schedule, and if anyone had questions, we felt confident and comfortable directing them to Carissa. She also helped set up our decor beautifully and really made our vision for the wedding come to life. And perhaps the best sign of a talented coordinator is the fact that on the day of, we felt like we just showed and didn’t have to worry about any of the logistics, and everything turned out beautifully. We truly could not have pulled off our dream wedding without her and would recommend her to anyone looking for an organized, responsive, and kind wedding coordinator!

Nichole was such a great support and I feel so lucky to have hired her. Having had some event planning experience myself, many people questioned why I would hire a wedding planner...

, and I have to say it was the best decision I could have made for my wedding. There were so many aspects I hadn't thought of that she was able to bring to the table. Having event experience even if it's with other peoples' weddings does not mean you can plan your own wedding. She gave me so much guidance and helped me see the light at the end of the tunnel when I was overwhelmed. My personal flaw is actually seeing things through and tying up those final annoying details that I was procrastinating on. Nichole did not allow that to happen and was able to lift me up every time and get things done. If you are considering getting a planner, the hype is real. Before even hiring her, she had already given me so much valuable advice that I decided to not look any further. Thank you for everything Nichole! <3

edding Assistant package provided just that! We worked with Marvina and Daniela, who together supported us through the seamless wedding day of my dreams! They handled day of communication with our vendors, helped keep us on time (and fed and hydrated!), and set up/took down all the decor. The decor looked even better than in I could have imagined and set up/tear down was an absolute breeze! But even better was the sense of calm and ease Marvina and Daniela gave us on our wedding day, and sweet touches like the extra polaroids they took of us lining up for and exiting our ceremony for our photo guest book. I would recommend 2 Friends Events to any Bay Area bride - it is 100% worth finding room in the budget to be able to relax and enjoy the day!

We were incredibly fortunate to have Nichole from 2 Friends Event as our month-of wedding planner. From day one, she not only heard our vision but brought it to life in the most sp...

ectacular way. Nichole’s guidance was invaluable, and her calm and patient demeanor on the day of the wedding was a true blessing. Nichole ensured that our wedding, which blended two cultures and religions (Indian and American), was a seamless and beautiful experience, and she was extremely organized and detail oriented. During the day of the wedding she made sure that everyone knew to come to her with questions, sparing the bride & groom from any unnecessary stress. At the end of the night she made sure everything was packed up and that all vendors were good to go. Thank you, Nichole, for making our special day unforgettable!

ves, but knew that we would need help on the actual day. I’m SO glad that we hired her for the month-of package. She responded promptly to emails (even with questions before the one-month mark!), came with us on our venue tour, and was EXTRAORDINARY in the two weeks leading up to the wedding. There were so many things that we hadn’t thought through - appetizer pacing, serving utensils, ceremony timing, etc. - that she swiftly, kindly, and expertly helped us figure out. On the day of the wedding, she handled it all. We got to enjoy a leisurely morning and our families got to relax, too! From the very beginning to the very end of the night (including cleanup long after we left), Nichole was on it. I can’t recommend 2FriendsEvents enough!

There is no question that choosing 2 Friends Events as our wedding planner was the best decision we made throughout the process. (And of course, we made a lot of other smart and de...

lightful decisions thanks to the 2FE team!) From our first call through the week after our wedding, Nichole and her team provided us constant support, seamless logistics and research, and brought so much joy to the planning process. As our planner, Nichole listened, helped keep us focused on what we said was important to us, and was always five steps ahead with her proactivity and organization. And my goodness, did she bring our vision to life! Everything from it being colorful and vibrant to finding an ADA friendly venue to incorporating our dog and favorite beverage Spindrift to herding us all on the wedding day (no strong feat!). Last but not least, each person we interacted with was just kind and a good human being. When we had a family crisis the weeks leading up to the wedding, she immediately helped pull together contingency plans. We couldn't have been more grateful for everything they did for us. Thank you, Nichole and team! Trust us, you won't regret choosing 2 Friends Events.

Jen and 2 Friends Events were a lifesaver throughout my wedding. Both Nicole and Jen were so patient throughout the entire process, even after I misread the contract twice and had ...

additional questions and ended up adjusting my contract. My partner and I were planning the whole thing on our own, and appreciated the detail they went into in our phone calls and timeline walkthroughs, as we were incredibly naive to wedding planning. Jen was a dream throughout the whole time. She anticipated our needs on the day-of, handling many of the details we didn't even think of at the time, like putting our "bride" and "groom" place-cards in a safe box after dinner, along with some other precious items from our ceremony. For what they offer, 2 Friends events is reasonably priced!! Save yourself the stress and go with them! I cannot imagine trying to have my wedding without the support and management of Jen, and 2 Friends Events in general. (Side note - We ended up hiring our bartender Elijah, through 2 Friends Events as well and he was excellent, we even got his recipes for our signature drinks afterwards!) Cannot rave enough about Jen and 2 Friends Events. If I could do it all over the exact same way, I absolutely would.

I cannot say enough things about 2 Friends Events! First, as our wedding planner, Nichole was BEYOND AMAZING. We are a relatively young couple and had a vision for our wedding but ...

did not know how to execute it. She listened, gave us options, helped sort out any doubts, and planned everything around the wishes we shared with her. She is very organized and friendly, so we never felt worried. Any time that we felt worried, she would ease us and reassure us :) Chrystal, the in-house florist, works magic! Again, we had a vision but not many ways to describe it. We gave her colors and the feeling we wanted, and SHE DELIVERED. Our flower arrangements were gorgeous and exceeded our expectations! Especially my bouquet! Last but certainly not least, I want to praise the day-of coordination team. We had someone from the team make an exclusive drive to pick up our cake (2 Friends Events to the rescue!). While Nichole and another team member took care of the reception, Asya and Daniela were with us at the ceremony. Daniela was so sweet in helping me with my dress and calming my nerves before I walked down the aisle! And Asya! She was fantastic!!! We were so nervous and gave her a quick overview of the ceremony beforehand (probably not a very useful one). Yet, she paid attention and outdid herself in helping us during the ceremony to make everything work out! She even took a few photos with our phones so we could have those immediately to share with our family. My now husband and I will 100% recommend working with 2 Friends Events. Do not miss out on having the greatest team for your wedding day!

She is kind, fun, and incredibly organized (her design slide deck in the early stages of planning and her day of spreadsheet are the best). Nichole took our visions for the wedding and brought them to life in an even better fashion than we could have imagined. We were honestly in awe when we saw how beautifully our venue was decorated! She also made sure that both of us (and our families) were able to be fully present on the wedding day without any concerns. Definitely the best day of our lives.

The best part about using 2F was handing all of our vendors off to Nichole a month before the wedding. She contacted them, got the contracts, and was the contact liaison between them. Awesome! Nichole ran the rehearsal. Day of the ceremony Nichole was awesome!!! She handled All of the vendors, the band, tables, chairs, wedding cake, EVERYTHING! When the wedding was over, I came to my room and everything was boxed and neatly organized. Even the brides veil was there. 2F was our best decision!

ew day-of/month-of coordinator for our wedding. I had handled most of the planning already but I knew I needed someone to step up that day and run the show while I couldn't. Insert Nichole from 2Friends who was mid-planning my coworkers May 2022 wedding. Nichole responded quickly via email and answered my million questions (did I mention I was scrambling at this point?!). When we spoke over the phone I felt very confident in her expertise and knew in my heart I wanted to hire 2Friends. I did some due diligence and talked with a couple other vendors but in my heart I trusted Nichole and knew her team would do a great job. Jen was an absolute pleasure to work with the last month before our wedding. She was a great communicator and allowed me to send her marathon text messages whenever a thought would strike me. She gave great advice and I really appreciated all the planning documents she had me fill out and the master she owned for me. That helped me realize the things I had overlooked and also calmed me down with the realization that I was more on top of everything than I thought. She reached out the all my vendors and made sure they were going to show up on time and knew what to do. She ran our rehearsal like a champ which wasn't the easiest due to our 3.5 year old flower girl and on the day of the wedding literally everything went smoothly. EVERYTHING. Every time I saw Jen the day of the wedding, she would let me know we were on time or ahead of schedule. I don't know what sort of magic she worked but she was a rockstar at staying behind the scenes, solving problems, and then also appearing right when we were needed somewhere and gently moving us to the next task. I never felt rushed from her, and I think I only got one super minor question all day from her which was such a blessing. I had literally nothing to decide that day, I just got to enjoy!! Thank you Jen and the 2Friends team! From this event planner bride you all did a fantastic job!

Jen and her assistant took such great care of our whole bridal party & family throughout the day and made sure everything went smoothly- including details I hadn't thought of like collecting the cards & gifts that people brought for us and setting them in a safe place to be picked up the following day. We also hired Chrystal for our floral arrangements, which turned out so beautiful and exactly like the Pinterest photos I'd sent her (actually probably better!). We cannot recommend 2FE enough!

They can fulfill all your wedding day needs while working with venues and staff who aren’t always on top of things, or, who are just plain difficult to deal with. At the end of a long night of celebration, it was such a relief to find that the two of them had packed up our car with all the wedding extras and supplies. Saved us a trip back to the venue the following day. The day after the wedding Asya shared with us all the beautiful photos and videos that she had captured of our daughters perfect wedding day! Couldn’t be happier with the outcome thanks to these two wonderful young women!

ng timeline, thinking of important details we’d overlooked in our planning, and finding the perfect mix of making sure everything was how we wanted it while also taking initiative to take care of things herself. She was amazing during the wedding day itself, keeping everything running smoothly and efficiently and making sure our other vendors (and guests!) knew the plan and had everything they needed. She managed to blend seamlessly into the event while also always being nearby whenever we needed anything. We could truly just enjoy ourselves and focus on the day itself knowing that all the logistics of the wedding were in her capable hands. Beyond her professionalism and efficiency, what really sets Asya apart is her thoughtfulness and caring. From the first time we spoke with her, it was immediately clear how much she truly cared about making our wedding beautiful, comfortable, and memorable down to the last detail. We also trusted her to help my wife’s disabled parent and sister get settled back in their hotel after the wedding, and she took special care of them both throughout the event even amidst her many other tasks. They both spoke very warmly of her the next day, as did my parents, whom she helped pack up and transport leftovers and supplies at the end of the night. Asya even sent us a sweet note the morning after the wedding with several lovely pictures that she’d somehow found time to take during the event. We would recommend Asya to anyone and trust her with any kind of event planning or coordination. Thank you so much for everything you did to make our special day perfect!
