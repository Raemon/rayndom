Zoe

Director of Sales

Zoe serves as Director of Sales, having joined Wedgewood Weddings in 2017 at Redwood Canyon. What she loves most about working at Wedgewood is the company culture and the endless opportunities for growth that the organization provides. Her journey into events began during college while she was studying to become an elementary school teacher and working as a server at a hotel. As a server, she fell in love with how every event was different and enjoyed learning about various cultures through her work. This passion led her to take a risk after college and pursue hospitality instead of teaching, which is when she discovered Wedgewood Weddings. What truly drives her is witnessing the reaction on couples' faces when they see their vision come to life—a feeling she describes as indescribable and something you need to experience to fully understand. Working at the Presidio has given Zoe the unique opportunity to experience many different types of events beyond just weddings, all while enjoying incredible views of the Golden Gate Bridge and the bay from every vantage point. When she's not at work, she loves spending time with her boyfriend and their two dogs, often taking day trips to the Presidio so the dogs can run on the beach while they explore the area's diverse food and activities. She also treasures time with family and friends, and enjoys hiking, traveling, working out, and has recently gotten back into reading.

eat online template for all the planning aspects of the wedding. The all in one approach was perfect for my needs. The tasting was easy. The timeline came together within a month out. On the day of the wedding, everything went really smooth. The wedding coordinator and team had everything set up. We were able to fit a tea ceremony there before the first look. Location is hard to beat as a venue. Weather was great so the bridge was clear and the city was clear. I really wanted the wedding here since I grew up here. Food on the day of was even better than the tasting. Bar service was good, no bottle necks in the lines esp. since majority of the group drank. The DJ, officiant and photographer they assigned were great, super easy to work with. We had no hiccups at all on our schedule. The staff at the end helped packed our decorations away too so nobody had to stay behind long.

I cannot say enough amazing things about Wedgewood Log Cabin! From start to finish, my wedding day was absolutely perfect, and the level of service we received was phenomenal. One ...

of the things I appreciated most was how convenient it was to have almost everything bundled together—most of the essential vendors were included, and their preferred vendors were fantastic to work with. It made the planning process so much more enjoyable and stress-free. A huge shoutout to my day-of coordinator, Jolina. She truly made my vision come to life and executed every detail flawlessly. I never once had to worry about things running smoothly because she handled everything with such professionalism and care. Thanks to her, I was able to be fully present and enjoy my special day without stress. Choosing Wedgewood was one of the best decisions we made. The all-in-one approach, combined with their incredible team, allowed us to actually enjoy wedding planning (which I know is rare to say!). I would highly recommend Wedgewood to any couple looking for a seamless, beautiful, and unforgettable wedding experience.

The one thing that my now-husband and I were looking for in a wedding was "easy." Wedgewood definitely made things VERY EASY. Plus, the laid-back, outdoorsy vibe of the Log Cabin a...

nd the view of the Golden Gate Bridge were definitely appealing. We went with the elite package and we are so glad we did. The elite package is a package with basically everything for your wedding: food, table settings, bar, photobooth, DJ, coordinator/planner, etc. Photography is extra (can do API Photography, Wedgwood's preferred vendor) and then I think personal flowers are extra as well (table flowers from Angela Floral Design come with the elite package, however). The only vendor I used from outside of Wedgewood's circle was for the flowers on the fireplace and personal flowers for me and the bridal party. Wedgewood has a lot of options and it was so easy to just pick things and not have to worry about contacting and organizing with too many other vendors. The full open bar was perfect. The food and service was amazing. We greatly appreciated our photographer (Brianna with API) and DJ (Aldwin with iMobile, also with Wedgewood). The space was decorated super nicely with the table flowers from Angela's Floral. The wedding itself went pretty smoothly, thanks to the Wedgewood coordinators. Of course, you don't have to do the full elite package. They have options if you have other vendors in mind. For example, maybe you want some specific food options that aren't available with Wedgewood, so you can definitely outsource just the food, but have Wedgewood take care of everything else. The Wedgewood coordinators all had a hand in helping answer questions promptly. Overall, planning a wedding is already stressful in itself, but Wedgewood really helped with pretty much everything. It really takes a load off your shoulders! Thank you Wedgewood! We're definitely recommending Wedgewood to our friends.

anyone looking for an all-in-one package, easy breezy planning, awesome event planners/coordinators, and a flawlessly executed day. The Log Cabin itself is beautiful, the food was amazing, the drinks were flowing, the flowers were beautiful, and the location in the Presidio is perfect. They have a fabulous team to help you plan and execute the wedding of your dreams! The team (Duckie, Jimmy, and Libby - huge shoutout!) all were awesome to work with through the planning process. Super communicative, responsive, professional, knowledgeable, and supportive through the whole thing. They helped us plan the most perfect day and made it so easy on us. Jimmy was our day-of coordinator and deserves extra praise for pivoting gracefully and adjusting the evening’s timeline flawlessly when our shuttles unfortunately were super late to arrive with our guests. The rest of the day-of team were all amazing, too. DJ Abel blew our socks off - we didn’t want typical wedding music, and he totally nailed the playlist and the vibe we were hoping for. I even had a touching moment with the security guard who pulled me aside and said he got emotional during the father/daughter dance, which was such a lovely thing for him to share. Wedgewood as an organization seems to have a very organized, structured approach to wedding planning, which I so appreciated. They were great partners and helped us have the most perfect day on one of the biggest days of our lives!

All guests were impressed by the food, music, and flowers, and the staff did such a great job accommodating our personalized decorations and kooky ceremony ideas. It was amazing to have so many elements included in the package and we were so grateful in the end to not have had to wrangle together all those vendors ourselves. This is a beautiful venue in such a wonderful location for guests to explore; really shows off the best of SF! Highly recommend.

: \- beautiful, rustic interior make minimal decorations needed \- outside view of the city and bridge \- huge dance floor \- perfect for dancing away into the evening where you can take breaks on the patio with a nice breeze; we even had a smores set up on the grill Cons: \- as you drive up to the venue you go by what seems to look like a pile of trash that's right by the parking lot (not great but after you park you don't really notice it) \- if having ceremony outside, very subject to the fickle, windy weather of the Presidio \- the Presidio Trust has some constraints regarding vendors and decorations \- no space for bridal party to prep \- 2 stalls per gender probably not great for larger parties
