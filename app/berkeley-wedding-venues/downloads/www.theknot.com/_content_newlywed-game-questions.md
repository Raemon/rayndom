And luckily, you've come to the right place. The Newlywed Game, based on the popular '60s game show of the same name, is an upbeat, low-stakes contest everyone will love. You can ask the couple who said "I love you" first or ask who their celebrity crushes are. It's an easy couples questions game that allows guests to get to know the newlyweds (or to-be-weds) better and test the love birds' knowledge about one another. Keep reading to learn how to play and see what Newlywed Game show questions we've compiled for you.

## How to Play the Newlywed Game

So many people get the [wedding shoe game questions](https://www.theknot.com/content/shoe-game-wedding-reception-game-questions) confused with the Newlywed Game. Unsure how this activity works? We break it down into three steps so you can play with ease.

### 

### 1\. Prep the questions and answers ahead of time.




Select at least 20 questions for the Newlywed Game—this amount is a good starting point to get everyone having fun and invested in the game. Once you've chosen your questions, send them to the happy couple so they can give you their answers separately. (Remind them they can't discuss the answers before the game since it defeats the purpose.) Ensure you keep a copy of the couple's responses so you can refer to them during the game.

### 2\. Host your own Newlywed Game show.

As the host of the game show, explain the rules to your audience so everyone is on the same page. Ask one question at a time to the couple or the to-be-wed (if you're doing Newlywed Game questions because you're [hosting a bridal shower](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-shower-host-etiquette) or bach party). Each person in the couple has to correctly guess what their partner answered to receive a point. The game is like a "test" to see how well the two know each other.

Lots of people have fun with this part of the game, so don't be afraid of going all out. Some people make slide show presentations with the questions and answers written out. We've even seen a few creative hosts have videos of the person's partner answering the questions as a dynamic prewedding party activity.

### 3\. Keep score and give out prizes.

It might be a little hard to keep track of the points and host so we suggest you ask someone else to write down how many points each person got. Once the points are tallied up, announce the winner. This isn't required, but giving [bridal shower game prizes](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-shower-game-prizes) or trophies to the winner is a sweet personal gesture everyone will love.
