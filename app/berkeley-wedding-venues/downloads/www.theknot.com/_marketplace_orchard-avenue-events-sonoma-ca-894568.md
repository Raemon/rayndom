Do you want a stress-free wedding day? Hire Sarah Aylward. She made us feel at ease, and took care of all the logistics of coordinating with our vendors, handling rentals, and desi...

gning the space for us. She is meticulous without being overbearing, cheery but not cloying, and overall a massive uplift to our whole experience. Our guests and vendors both remarked on how smoothly everything ran, and how stress-free my spouse and I appeared throughout the day. I've heard horror stories about other planners from friends and colleagues, and I wish I could travel back in time to their weddings and recommend Sarah to them. She's just that good.

We wholeheartedly agree with every positive comment in Brooke's previous reviews! She made our entire wedding day flow effortlessly from start to finish. We found Brooke by searchi...

ng for wedding planners that had worked with our venue (Timber Cove Resort) before. We decided to go with the partial planning package, which fit our needs well. Early in the planning process, we'd spend time researching vendors on our own as well as ask Brooke for her recommendations, then reach out to the vendors on both of our lists. We found ourselves choosing her suggestions almost every time. Her industry experience and keen eye for quality vendors became obvious very quickly, yet she never made us feel pressured to go with any particular choice. Furthermore, throughout the entire process, Brooke was incredibly mindful of our budget. In our very first meeting, she showed us a detailed budget from a previous wedding she did at our venue and walked us through each line item, pointing out areas where we might want to allocate more or less based on our priorities. This level of transparency and attention to detail immediately gave us confidence in her approach. Most importantly for us, her communication style was exactly what we needed. We often sent her emails late at night, and Brooke would consistently respond first thing the next morning with clear, comprehensive answers. There was not a single time that she didn’t address a concern in one of our emails, even when we sent her massive lists. Brooke's flexibility was another standout quality. While our contract only covered the wedding day itself, we had planned a Welcome Dinner the night before and a Farewell Brunch the day after that we intended to handle ourselves. Unlike other planners we'd heard about from our friends who strictly limit their involvement to contracted days (which is understandable), Brooke was incredibly supportive when questions came up about these additional events. When our wedding day arrived, everything ran flawlessly! Even when we had a last-minute request to move our toasts indoors due to wind and chilly weather, Brooke handled it seamlessly without missing a beat. We can't imagine having planned our wedding without Brooke. We truly couldn’t think of anything negative when she asked for our feedback after the wedding. We absolutely recommend her without reservation!

lot of amazing vendors, is detail oriented, builds out the entire roadmap and is a no nonsense type - she gets things done gracefully. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our experience working with her to plan our wedding at Fairmont Sonoma Golf Club and have already recommended her to a few others in our network. 10 out of 10!

I cannot imagine a more competent, experienced, professional, and kind wedding planner than Brooke Gustafson of Orchard Avenue Events. She truly pulled out all the stops to create ...

the most magical, heavenly day of my life! My husband and I were in awe and so impressed by her, especially since we are pretty detail oriented ourselves. Brooke is even more so, and genuinely cared that our wedding day was perfectly executed from start to finish. She is prompt when responding to emails and texts and is always on time. In addition, her extensive industry experience is obvious and came in handy time and time again as we navigated the complicated wedding planning process. It is important to note that she is also very kind, understanding, and hard working, so I never once felt uncomfortable asking her questions or for tasks to be done. Brooke knew how much I cared about the look and feel of our wedding being just right, and she completely blew me out of the water - so much so that I cried for the first time before walking down the aisle when she gave me a sneak peak of the reception hall. And on my wedding night, Brooke provided all of my bridesmaids flip flops and even went back to our hotel to grab the flats I left behind so that we could dance the night away! She is so special and a true artist. Without a doubt - there is no one else you should hire for your wedding planner - Brooke is the one! (Nicole and Nicholas Errico - Sonoma Golf Club - 6/3/23)

When my husband and I decided that we would like to have a “winery wedding,” we did not realize that almost all of the vineyards require a wedding planner. At first, I thought thi...

s was a superfluous requirement as I consider myself an excellent organizer. However, in hindsight, I am SO grateful for this requirement. Coordinating in the days, hours, and minutes leading up to the wedding could have been a hectic whirlwind. However, I was cool as a cucumber because I was blessed to have Sarah Aylward of Orchard Avenue Events by my side. Sarah worked diligently to make our wedding vision come become reality. She had awesome recommendations for local vendors at different budget points. This was extremely helpful, as my husband and I live out-of-state. At the beginning of our wedding planning journey, we expressed that we were particularly concerned about outlining and sticking to a budget. Sarah went out of her way to create an editable spreadsheet for us with a budget that could be adjusted as we went along. We had multiple check-ins with Sarah, who always brought the positivity. She has a wonderful talent for knowing when to reach out with some calming words and when to send a reminder for that thing that my husband and I SAID we were going to do, but completely forgot about. Closer to the wedding, I felt such a relief to be in the backseat. I never worried for a second about coordinating the vendors, the timeline for the actual wedding, managing the guests—she had it all under control. Even when we threw things at her last minute, Sarah remained committed to giving us our dream wedding. For example, in the weeks leading up to the wedding, my husband and I spontaneously dreamed of a photo booth and videogame station at our reception (nerdy, but that’s us!). I would not have judged a wedding planner for saying these requests were too late—there wasn’t enough time to organize. However, Sarah did not bat an eye- she just gave us great advice and helped us make it happen. I am typically an anxious person but Sarah promised me that she would guard me from stress during the wedding. She kept that promise and I am so thankful for her attention to detail, calm presence, and warm disposition. I HIGHLY recommend her and Orchard Avenue Events for your big day.

Brooke was absolutely terrific to work with from start to finish. She's organized, practical, responsive, and flexible. She understood what mattered to us and suggested great ideas...

to ensure we had the event we wanted, and made sure that absolutely nothing that needed to be done got forgotten. Her expert advice on our timeline made for a terrific event, with guests complimenting us that the long evening (NYE wedding) always felt exciting and the time before midnight flew by. More than anything, we knew that with Brooke on our team, if anything went wrong on the wedding day we were in the absolute best possible hands and she would get it taken care of (probably without us even knowing anything had come up!) which allowed us to totally enjoy our own day.

Wow! I can't recommend Orchard Avenue Events and Brooke enough. My wife and I first reached out to Brooke at the height of the lockdown during the pandemic. We needed someone to...

help us plan our California wedding, and Brooke seemed like a good fit. Choosing to work with her was the best decision we could have ever made. Brooke is professional, helpful, caring and amazing to work with. At every step of the process, she guided us and supported us. Brooke has knowledge of all the vendors and suggested a fantastic team for us to work with. She helped us secure our venue even when we were in New York at the time. As the wedding day approached, she took on so many tasks, including making our website, designing and printing our menus, and handling ALL the logistics. Brooke was always the first to ask us, "How can I help you?" and was incredibly eager to take on any task. She offered us advice when we needed it, helped with our budget, and got to know our friends and family. Even as Covid impacted wedding planning, Brooke was able to keep us calm and on task. Our wedding day went PERFECTLY thanks to Brooke. She worked amazingly with all the vendors and was so helpful at every turn. For example, my wife had left her veil in the hotel room, and Brooke had her business partner run back to grab it. When I didn't love my initial bouquet, Brooke made sure it was perfect. We had the best day because of Brooke. We loved Brooke so much that we also hired her to plan a post-wedding pool party for 120 people at my parents' house the next day. Just as with the wedding, Brooke made sure the event was perfect. I could go on and on about how much I love Brooke and Orchard Avenue Events. Even from a financial standpoint, it was money VERY well spent, and she was able to help guide our wedding spending so we saved money in other places and didn't waste money on bad vendors. If you are lucky enough to have the opportunity to work with Brooke and Orchard Avenue Events, GO FOR IT!

n *better* than the original plan because of Brooke's incredible ability to problem solve on the fly. Most importantly, I had ZERO stress in the days leading up to our wedding and thoroughly enjoyed myself on our big day because I was 100% confident everything was in Brooke's very capable hands. I cannot overstate how important this—my (now) husband and I agreed throughout the planning process that hiring Brooke was easily the best money we spent on our wedding. Brooke is exceptionally detail-oriented and creative in the way that she works to achieve your vision within your style and budget. She is a delight to work with, bringing many years of valuable experience and local vendor connections to the table. She makes you feel at ease from day 1, is amazingly fast with thorough responses to emails/calls, and is just the best wedding planner you could imagine. If you want the wedding of your dreams and an amazing woman by your side to expertly guide you through the adventure that is wedding planning, then you simply must choose Brooke at Orchard Avenue Events!

My wife and I could not say enough amazing things about Brooke- both as a person and as a wedding planner. Her responsiveness and attention to detail are unlike anything I have see...

n before. She was always five steps ahead of us, which was invaluable to my wife and I who were not familiar in any way with process of planning a wedding. Brooke was always incredibly patient and kind with the endless questions we had and changes we wanted to make- she truly made all of our wedding dreams come true with a smile on her face and such a contagiously positive attitude. Brooke's sense of style and vision are incredible and her close connections to the event planning community in both Sonoma and Napa gave us a clear path to selecting the best vendors we could have asked for based on our budget. We live in VA and did not know one vendor in Sonoma (where our wedding was), but Brooke facilitated every single connection we could have ever needed and our wedding was seamless, from start to finish, thanks to Brooke. We cannot recommend Orchard Avenue events enough. There is no way to describe the value you get by choosing them as your planner. But in a final attempt to reinforce our overly positive experience, after our wedding, my wife and I were most sad that our time working with Brooke was over. We loved every minute of our experience with Brooke and will be jealous of the future brides and grooms that have the pleasure of working with her!

When we first got engaged my fiancee and I felt that there was no way we would hire a wedding planner. We were more than capable of handling it on our own. But as we got into the...

process of planning a Sonoma wedding from Los Angeles, we realized that we needed help. And that's when the wedding coordinator at our venue recommended Brooke from Orchard Avenue Events and our lives got a lot easier. Brooke was invaluable in helping us to figure out how to have a wedding that felt true to the outdoorsy-quirky-geeks that we are and still be classy and beautiful. She paid attention to all the things we said we wanted and then got back to us with lots of ideas that we never would have thought of on our own. The vendors she recommended to us were all fantastic and she went the extra mile to make sure that they all gave us their best. On the day of the wedding she set up all the decorations and then packed them all up for us after the reception, which allowed us to stay focused on just enjoying the day and having a good time with our friends and family. And through it all Brooke was always a delight to work with - even when she was giving us bad news. We could not have asked for a better organized, innovative, or more wonderful person to have as our wedding planner than Brooke.

I can't say enough good things about Brooke Altman who owns Orchard Avenue Events. She is AMAZING and a miracle worker!!! We didn't have to worry about a thing at our wedding beca...

use she had everything under control: we just had to show up and have fun! She is worth ten times her weight in gold. Yes, she's that good. And let me add that initially, I wasn't 100% sold on the idea of getting a planner. I love hosting parties and have coordinated a few large events in my day so I figured I could handle it. Wrong! After ten minutes of speaking with her, my stress levels were already significantly reduced. I work full time and soon realized that without Brooke, there was no way I would have come out of this wedding with my sanity intact. Why is she so good? First, she's experienced. She's planned large events for many years. She anticipates potential issues, is a wealth of information and referrals, if needed. Second, she's unflappable. Nothing phases her. If the power goes out or the kitchen blows up, whatever - she's prepared and will fix it. Third, she plans. She is organized, asks all the right questions and gets the plan right in advance so the day-of, there's nothing to worry about. Fourth, she listens. You want a goofy theme, have a tight budget, or are planning the Event of the Century, she will understand and implement your vision. Fifth, she's fun! She clearly loves what she does and she works so hard to make everything go right. My husband and I are ready to adopt her, we love her so much :)
