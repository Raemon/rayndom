fect. The venue has so much to offer for everyone. There is a gorgeous bridal suite for the bride and bridal party to get ready in. There was also a cool old airstream and fenced in area that they guys got to hang out in to get ready. We did our ceremony on the steps of the red chapel and then had our reception inside the barn. Our guest keep raving how much fun they all had. There are so many different activities for the guest to do that they didn't want to leave. With all of the antiques and decor all you really need to bring is flowers. I highly recommend having your wedding at Long Branch if you are looking for something rustic and country.

I have nothing but wonderful things to say about Long Branch Saloon and Farms! My husband and I got married there October 2018 and from start to finish we had the most delightful e...

xperience! Cassidy is the absolute best and truly wants to make the day as special as it can be. Not to mention she's part of the family who owns and runs it, and the passion they have for this beautiful property can be seen in every little detail that's been added. I sent Cassidy email after email asking every question I could think of, and I always received a quick and friendly response. There is something for every guest to do at Long Branch between the mini golf, saloon, games, etc, so you are guaranteed to not have one bored guest! We had a cocktail hour, and it was great to have so many things for our guests to do while we finished up photos. Everyone is STILL talking about our wedding and how it was the best wedding and venue they've ever been too! I would highly recommend Long Branch if you are looking for a unique venue that has a little something for everyone - you will not be disappointed!

My wedding was this Saturday, August 26, 2017. I reserved Long Branch Saloon and Farms a year ago. From the beginning Lisa was amazing. Throughout the entire year all of our que...

stions were answered in a timely manner. Layouts and vendors list were sent out as many times as I asked. The entire planning went so smooth. It was so smooth that I thought it may be too good to be true and something would go astray on the wedding day. But my wedding day was PERFECT!! BEYOND PERFECT!!! Lisa, Kevin and the entire staff were so professional but in a very chill and relaxed way. I got hitched without a hitch!!!! I would highly highly recommend Long Branch!!

We just had our wedding last night at Long Branch and it was beyond perfect. In the planning process Lisa was such an amazing help. Her vendor list and knowledge of what you may ...

need/want was such a help, and she was always and email or phone call away. My fiancé and I selected this venue because of its uniqueness. And all throughout the night it was amazing to hear all our guests say they had never been to a wedding or venue like ours before. Between slingshots, mini golf, poker, and corn hole, no one was bored. It was also so great to know that Kevin the owner was on hand the whole night to make sure everything was going smoothly. His daughter was one of our bar tenders and she was so sweet and helpful as well. I could seriously go on and on about how amazing it all turned out! We are REALLY hoping someone we know will decide to get married there so we can go back and enjoy the venue as guests.

I got married at Long Branch on March 19th, 2016. I don't know that words can describe how truly perfect the day was, but i'm going to give it a shot. My husband and I fell in ...

love with this place when we attended a company party here, and when we were wandering around the venue we stepped into the little church at the end of town; we both knew this was where we wanted to get married, and 2 years later here we are!! Special shutout to Lisa - right from the beginning about a year ago Lisa was always responsive and friendly with email correspondence. I visited the site at least 5 times throughout the planning process and Lisa always made sure that Kevin or one of the other LB Staff was on hand to open things up and answer any questions that I had. I'm a very detail oriented person, so I'm absolutely sure that I was probably driving her nuts with all of my countless questions and emails, but she was always wonderful to work with. On the day of the wedding she was our bartender and did a fabulous job, even coming around to the dinner tables to re-fill champagne glasses for the toasts! She was amazing and I cannot thank her enough for helping to make my dreams come true on my wedding day. Also, Kevin - you are a freaking genius for coming up with this fantastic little event space. All of my vendors did an amazing job, and Long Branch and the staff are certainly no exception. The staff was friendly and helpful to my small army of set-up helpers (I had to do exactly ZERO set up myself) and throughout the day they were on hand to make sure parking went smoothly, restrooms and garbage cans were attended to, and the casino staff was awesome - poker and roulette were a hit! The slingshots had fresh elastic and the bins were full of rocks to shoot, the fire pits were burning, they had the heat lamps going, the chairs were beautiful and clean, tables laid out exactly how I wanted them, the wagon wheel sweetheart table and Victorian settee, s'more bar, cornhole game, EVERYTHING was just perfect. If you're looking for a FUN and truly memorable wedding or party space for your guests, this is the spot! I've had so many of our guests tell us that this was the best wedding they'd ever been to, and I totally agree!! The venue is so interesting and there is so much to do and look at that it really requires very little decoration to make it look really amazing and your guests will never be bored. Logistics wise, Lisa can recommend vendors who are familiar with the space. Pricing was really reasonable considering that you don't have to rent tables and chairs and your decor budget will be tiny (no need for expensive lighting here)! Vendors can drive right into the "town" to unload which is very convenient for set-up, and guest parking is right in front of the space - no long walks for grandma and grandpa! The space above the saloon is a perfect space for getting your makeup and hair finalized and getting your dress on - my photographer got some AMAZING getting ready shots. Long Branch, I love you. I'll be back every chance I get.

I recently had my wedding at the Long Branch Saloon and Farm in Half Moon Bay, and it could not have been more perfect. In the beautiful Half Moon Bay hills, there is nestled the r...

ecreation of an old west main street filled with beautiful and authentic wild west antiques that just make this venue magical and beyond belief. Having the ceremony and reception at the same place is a huge cost savings, and makes it easier for you and the guests. There was so much to do on the grounds, from sling shots, lasso lessons, and mini golf, to hanging out in the beautiful antique bar and dancing in the parlor there was never a lull in the action. Kevin was wonderful to work with and always had all the answers. Lisa was great at working with us and finding times for us to make multiple visits to the site over the year to scout things out with our different vendors and our parents. They were always happy to help and answer any questions. They have most things you'll need to make your party complete. I would advise you bring your planner/caterer to the venue to see what they can and cant do as far as food storage and cooking. We planned ahead and came with our cater who was able to do whatever he needed before hand, and use the facilities for anything else he needed, and it seemed to work pretty perfectly. We were told by many guests that they couldn't believe we found such an amazing location, and it was the most fun they've ever had at a wedding, which besides getting married, was one of our ultimate goals. I high recommend Long Branch farms for your rustic/country/wild west dream wedding. Thank you for such an unforgettable wedding day!
