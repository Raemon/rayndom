  * How Many Slow Dance Songs Should You Play at a Wedding?
  * The Best Wedding Slow Dance Songs for Your Reception



## How Many Slow Dance Songs Should You Play at a Wedding?

To determine how many slow dance songs to play at a wedding, we decided to [ask a wedding DJ](https://www.theknot.com/content/questions-to-ask-dj) for expert insight. "If you're looking to have a high-energy party, one to two slow songs, maximum, is ideal," explains Michael Coombs, owner and DJ of [Michael Coombs Entertainment](https://www.michaelcoombs.ca/) in Toronto, Canada. "As much as some guests may want them, they can kill the vibe quickly, and it's best to limit them to keep the party going strong."

Alternatively, if you're envisioning an elegant sit-down soiree as opposed to a high-energy dance party, feel free to increase the quantity of slow dance songs. For more assistance and inspiration, you can also visit The Knot Vendor Marketplace to find a [wedding DJ](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/wedding-djs) or [live band](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/live-wedding-bands) to help create the perfect soundtrack for your wedding
