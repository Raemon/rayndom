As I scrolled through Pinterest gathering bridal hair inspo, I felt an immediate sense of defeat. There was _no_ way my fine hair was going to be able to twist up into anything more than a tiny, lifeless bun—I was going to need hair extensions for wedding day. The good news? After chatting with my wedding hairstylist, I learned that the process would be a lot less complicated than I thought. But before I commit to any kind of beauty treatment or procedure, I like to do my research. And I knew that if I had questions about bridal hair extensions, then you probably would too. So, I chatted with a few experts to get the lowdown on everything there is to know about the hair extension process, from the [wedding hairstyles](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-hairstyles-you-will-love) they work best with to the pros and cons of each extension type. Read on to learn more, and once you hire a hairstylist, be sure to use them as a resource—they'll be there to help guide you through the process and make expert recommendations depending on your desired look.

## Do You Need Hair Extensions for Wedding Hairstyles?

Hair extensions aren't _required_ for wedding hairstyles, but according to hairstylist Jaci Frazier of [Southern Tease](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/southern-tease-luxury-hair-and-makeup-new-braunfels-tx-971892), you may still want to consider them. "I always say extensions only improve a look, so I recommend having them for most styles," she says. Extensions provide a simple way to boost volume and length, and because they've been chemically processed, they typically hold curls better than natural hair. So if your dream bridal hairstyle is something along the lines of a bouncy blowout, romantic half-up, half-down waves or a voluminous ponytail, hair extensions could be a great option for you.

On the other hand, certain hairstyles won't necessarily benefit from the addition of hair extensions. "This includes most [updos](https://www.theknot.com/content/updos-for-long-hair), especially slick-backs, styles that utilize a client's natural curl texture and styles on those who already have long, thick hair," says hairstylist [Anastasia Miller](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/anastasia-mua-pro-hair-+-makeup-team-austin-tx-2011625). At the end of the day, it's all about the look you're going for and what you want to achieve. While I went with a fairly sleek updo for my wedding day, I still opted for wedding hair with extensions. After giving my updo a test run at my [hair trial](https://www.theknot.com/content/prep-for-hair-and-makeup-trial), I simply felt that my bun wasn't full enough without them. "If you're curious about extensions and if they'll be a good addition to your bridal hair, [ask your wedding hairstylist](https://www.theknot.com/content/questions-to-ask-your-hairstylist). They can guide you through the options and let you know what they recommend for your desired look," Miller adds.

## What to Know Before Choosing Bridal Hair Extensions

One of the most important things to know about hair extensions is that there are two main types: permanent (or semi-permanent) and clip-ins. [How long hair extensions last](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-long-do-hair-extensions-last) depends entirely on which type you go with. Below, we're breaking down the wear time you can expect from each, plus a few pros and cons worth noting before you make a decision.

### Clip-In Hair Extensions

Clip-in extensions are exactly what they sound like—they're temporary hair pieces you can self-install in a matter of minutes thanks to their easy-to-use clips. Because they're offered in a variety of sizes and weights, the customization options are endless. You can add in one or two pieces for a touch of volume, or you can add several for a fuller, longer look overall. This is the option Miller and Frazier recommend most when it comes to bridal extension hair "Clip-in extensions are ideal for wedding day, as the placement of the wefts can be completely customized to the desired style," says Frazier.

I went with clip-in hair extensions for my wedding day, per my wedding hairstylist's recommendation, and I couldn't have been happier with how they turned out. [BFB's 18" Fill-ins](https://www.bfbhair.com/products/brownstone-18-inch-fill-ins) in the shade "Brownstone" were a perfect match for my natural hair color and provided just the right amount of fullness to my sleek, low bridal bun. In fact, I loved them so much that I still pop them in every once in a while to add a little volume when I want it. Yes—they're _that_ easy to use.

### Semi-Permanent & Permanent Hair Extensions

If you're looking for something less temporary, you may find semi-permanent or permanent extensions to be the better route. "Hand-tied extensions are great for the bride who wants to have extra hair for all of her bridal events—showers, parties, the rehearsal dinner and wedding day," says Frazier. Popular methods include tape-ins, sew-ins and keratin bonds, and depending on which you go with, you can expect the results to last anywhere from one to several months. The catch, however, is that semi-permanent and permanent extension methods must be professionally applied, and longer-lasting options will require more regular maintenance and upkeep. So unless permanent or semi-permanent extensions are something you're already interested in, clip-ins will likely be the better option for wedding day. They'll give your stylist much more flexibility when it comes to achieving your desired style.

## Bridal Hair Extensions FAQ

Now that you know the ins and outs of wedding hair extensions and who might be a good candidate for them, there's a good chance you still have questions (I certainly did). How much do they cost? What's the ideal timeline? How does one take care of them? Our experts help us break it down below.

### How much do hair extensions cost for a wedding?

The cost of hair extensions for a wedding varies greatly depending on which method you decide to go with. According to Frazier, you can expect clip-ins to fall somewhere between $70 and $300 based on the weight, length and type of hair. Professional extensions, however, will likely range between $600 and $1,100 for an initial appointment. Many bridal hairstylists offer clip-in extension services for an additional fee, while permanent and semi-permanent extensions should be done at the salon. Don't forget to factor the [average wedding hair and makeup cost](https://www.theknot.com/content/average-cost-wedding-hair-makeup) into your budget and plan for any additional fees that may come with the hair extension method you choose.

[Try Our Free Budget Tool](https://www.theknot.com/budget-advisor)

### When should you get hair extensions for a wedding?

If you're getting professional extensions for the wedding, you should aim to have them done at least two months prior to the wedding. Start by booking a hair consultation with your salon stylist about six months prior to the big day so they can create a personalized timeline and care routine. While the timeline for clip-in extensions is more flexible, you should still consider testing them out at least two months in advance. Not only will this allow you to get a full picture of your look at your bridal hair trial, but it will also allow plenty of time to reorder if you need to make any changes to the color or length.

### How do you care for hair extensions before the wedding?

Regardless of which hair extension style you go with, it's important to make sure you care for them properly—this will prevent damage to the extensions _and_ your natural hair. For clip-in extensions, this means brushing them after each use and storing them on a hanger in a protective bag. "Some artists may prefer you to shampoo and dry your extensions prior to the wedding day, but most are okay with using them straight out of the box," says Miller. For hand-tied extensions, you'll want to develop a maintenance routine with your stylist. According to Frazier, this will likely call for a few high-quality [hair tools](https://www.theknot.com/content/average-cost-wedding-hair-makeup), like blow-drying after each wash to keep the hair free of tangles, as well as getting the extensions moved up every four to six weeks.

## Best Clip-In Hair Extension Brands for Weddings

As mentioned, permanent and semi-permanent extensions should be selected and applied by a professional. However, if you decide you want to go the clip-in extension route, we have plenty of recommendations you can shop right now from the best hair extensions brands. If you'll be hiring a wedding hairstylist, make sure to ask what they recommend once you [choose a wedding hairstyle](https://www.theknot.com/content/choosing-a-wedding-day-hairstyle). While some looks may only need one or two fill-ins for extra volume, others may require a full set or even a unique style, like a ponytail or bun attachment. No matter what you're looking for in the way of bridal clip-in hair extensions, consider the following brands the cream of the crop.

### BELLAMI Hair

### Insert Name Here

**Why we recommend them:** Insert Name Here's clip-in hair extensions are some of the most affordable you can find, which is impressive considering how high-quality they are. Though you can typically expect 100% human hair extensions to last longer, the vegan synthetic hair that INH uses looks like the real deal—and will certainly do the trick for a one-day affair. The brand has some of the most unique clip-ins I've seen, from half-up, half-down styles to braided ponytails and everything in between. The reviews also speak for themselves, with customers consistently praising their quality and color selection.

**Price range:** $39–$239

### BFB Hair

**Why we recommend them:** BFB Hair's clip-in extensions and fill-ins are the kind you can expect to last—and after using these hair extensions for my bridal updo in 2024, I can confidently confirm this is the case. They're ethically sourced and made with 100% human remy hair, they're easy to use and they won't damage your natural strands. The 18" fill-ins were ideal for adding volume to my bridal bun, but you'll also find 14" fill-ins along with classic 21" and 24" options for adding length. For volume _and_ length, you'll want to opt for the brand's "No Show," a single weft that sits comfortably in place with an invisible string and five clips. Best of all, each order is shipped with a "tester weft," so you can make sure the color is right before opening the main package.

**Price range:** $110–$495
