l, responsive, and took the time to understand the vibe we wanted for our celebration. On the wedding day, he brought the perfect energy. He had the ability to read the crowd and seamlessly mix songs. His transitions were smooth, his timing was spot-on, and he really knew how to build the energy throughout the night. We couldn’t have asked for a better DJ. Tony went above and beyond to make our reception unforgettable, and we’re so grateful we chose him. If you want someone who’s talented, easy to work with, and guaranteed to get your guests dancing, DJ Tony is the one!

ith him. Before our wedding, Tony offered to meet as many times as we would like to make us feel comfortable. He also used an app for us to share our music choices with him, which was very easy to use. Having worked with our venue (Timber Cove) before, Tony knew exactly where to set up everything for optimal sound quality. We had zero sound issues throughout the night, which we know can often be a problem - especially in windy conditions like we experienced at our oceanside venue. When we made a last-minute decision to move the toasts indoors due to wind and chilly weather, he pivoted seamlessly. Tony seems like a genuinely passionate individual who truly loves what he does, and it shows in his work. We danced all night and were so grateful for DJ Tony!

From the start, working with Tony, the owner, was a pleasure. He was great at coordinating everything and genuinely wanted us to be happy, which really showed in the service we received. The sound quality for the ceremony was excellent, and the music throughout the day was seamless. DJ DLT did a fantastic job keeping the dance floor alive—we all had so much fun dancing the night away! The photo booth was a huge hit, with everyone enjoying it. Fabio, the photo booth manager, did a great job designing the photo strips, adding a fun touch to our celebration. We truly appreciated their contributions to our special day and evening. I highly recommend Nor Cal Pro Sounds for anyone looking for top-notch sound, DJ, and photo booth services! Thank you, Nor Cal Pro Sounds, for making our wedding unforgettable!

ur top priorities. We are so beyond happy with our experience with DJ Tony and would recommend him 11/10!!! Throughout the entire planning process, DJ Tony was organized and responsive to all of our questions. The night of our wedding we were absolutely blown away. The music set was beyond amazing and so much better than we could have imagined. While we did give DJ Tony a playlist / genres of songs, the way he mixed and delivered them was truly a work of art. Thank you so much DJ Tony for exceeding our expectations and keeping the dance floor poppin all night long.

We truly could not say enough positive words to convey the awesome job Nor Cal Pro Sound team did from start to finish on our wedding process. After a few “interesting” phone calls...

with less experienced DJ and MC services it was instantly helpful to have Alex lead our introductory phone call to be sure they offered everything we were hoping for. His recommendation of DJ Luis Alvarez was absolutely perfect for our needs. Luis was vibrant and enthusiastic on every phone call and as much as one can be via email and text. They offer an awesome app making it easy to customize the music for your special day. From the cocktail playlist to your specific first dance and speeches they cover all the details in the comprehensive app. During our calls it was great to have DJ Luis's experience to reference in planning our day and allowing appropriate time for the full timeline. Our officiant had nothing but great things to say about working with Luis, he made it very simple for us to be sure everyone could hear the ceremony and speeches. Even after leaving some of our playlists short of complete the ability to fill in the night and feel out the vibe of our party was more than impressive. We opted to add an additional half hour to extend the great times. We have heard stories of people being sore and couples dancing together for the first time in a decade. Truly illustrating the need to get up and move to the excellently curated playlist. Again we can't thank or recommend the team at Nor Cal Pro Sound enough for your big events. We will be sending friends and family their way and hope you do as well. Mr & Mrs. Paine

o set the tone for each phase of the day–from before the ceremony to the last dance. Whenever we met to discuss our plans, Tony was patient and generous with our time, ensuring we felt comfortable with every decision. He was always prompt in his responses to any of our correspondences and made the process of curating music an inclusive, collaborative process. When it came to the party, Tony expertly mixed songs in fun and unexpected ways, so there was never a lull on the dance floor. We are so grateful to him for making our special day truly a reflection of who we are as a couple and what we envisioned for our wedding celebration, and we can’t recommend him more highly.

that I had. They have all of their processes and procedures in place to make sure that your booking and planning process go smoothly, which was really nice for me since I was a type A bride! I spent a lot of time searching for the right DJ, as I truly feel like the music makes or breaks the experience at a wedding! Fabian was amazing and had our guests dancing the entire time, and he was organized and prepared for all MCing throughout the event. Fabian helped the day run smoothly and didn’t miss any of the details that I had hoped for. Additionally, our guest list had a very broad taste in music so I was afraid that some people wouldn’t be up and dancing if they didn’t like the songs being played, but Fabian was able to find a happy medium and good vibe that everyone of all ages enjoyed.

he best decision we made for our wedding, period. Tony is an absolute professional and from the moment we first talked to him we KNEW we were in amazing hands and were going to have a blast at our wedding. It's been several weeks since our wedding and our friends are still messaging us to send them our dance songs / playlist -- that's how much fun everyone had! We had to downsize our wedding a bit because of COVID and were worried about the dance floor vibe (since we always knew that would be a highlight of our wedding). Tony and his crew made sure that we were dancing ALL NIGHT -- even some of our older family members stuck around till the end! From the lighting to the music, everything was absolutely spot on and so in line with the vibe we communicated during the planning process. His responsiveness throughout and willingness to accommodate our requests just went above and beyond what we would have expected from any wedding vendor. He put special touches into our dinner music that only we would notice and find special -- and it honestly meant the world to us. THANK YOU DJ Tony and the entire Nor Cal Pro Sound team for making our wedding the most memorable evening of our lives. We will cherish those memories and your role in them forever and ever!

NorCal Pro Sound did a great job at our wedding! They were responsive leading up to the event, getting back to emails and scheduling calls to walk through selecting songs, go over ...

specific details of the ceremony, and answer any questions we had. They worked well with our planner (who had originally recommended NorCal Pro Sound to us) and venue too. They took some of our more interesting requests (a short karaoke-like section) in stride and worked well with us on the music selections and timings of moments within the event. The lavalier mic on the officiant worked great during the ceremony and and the lighting was excellent during the dancing. DJ Refugio did a great job, we couldn't have asked for anything better leading up to or during the event itself!

Our wedding planner recommended Nor Cal Pro Sound to us when our original DJ could not make our new covid-postponed wedding date. Immediately we were impressed by the team's prompt...

and detailed responses. They were also extremely on top of communication, planning out multiple phone calls to go over the process and make sure we had everything we needed. We ended up having to postpone our date a second time, and they worked with us to be sure they could still DJ our new date. They made the process so stress-free and easy. We specifically worked with Alex, Tony, and our DJ, DJ Willie Gonzalez. On the day of the event, Willie was able to mic not only our officiant, but also our friend who was singing and playing guitar during the ceremony. Our guests could hear everything beautifully, and the sound was extremely well-balanced, which can be difficult to achieve sometimes in outdoor venues. For the reception, Willie helped us create a diverse and fun playlist, along with specialized lighting, that had guests dancing all night. Our guests even commented that they could hear our toasts and speeches very well, even from a decent distance from the stage/speakers. When my husband forgot to pick up our wedding cake in town, DJ Willie sent his assistant to pick it up for us, so we could still have our ceremonial cake cutting. I will never forget how absolutely above and beyond Willie went for us to make our day special. He even took photos of the reception and sent me the link later that night. We can't recommend Nor Cal Pro Sound enough for your special event.

He even made sure I was there on the dance floor to play my favorite songs! He started the party better than I ever could and honestly, he truly is one of the nicest, easiest going vendors I have ever met. He works with you prior to your wedding to ensure all the music and your vision is met. His uplighting for our reception also was a HUGE bonus. It changed the whole feel of the room from the reception to the party.

As every bride knows, you should contact a few different vendors when looking to book for your wedding. After shopping around in the area I live in, I decided to look around our ve...

nue. I stumbled across Nor Cal Pro Sound and saw rave reviews online. This must be a good sign, right?! I contacted the company via email and received a reply within 24 hours. AHH!!!! (As the beams from the heavens shined down on me! You would not believe how many people don't respond OR don't respond promptly!) Anyway, the moment I exchanged conversation with Stephanie, I knew that we HAD to have them DJ our wedding. She was personable, yet very professional. When I found out that they had other couples interested in our date, I did not hesitate leaving a deposit! Price was not an issue at this point, because I knew it was the perfect fit. However, out of all the vendors we contacted, they were the most affordable! Stephanie was so helpful along the wedding planning process. I would sit at my desk and see to my surprise an email from her; she would ask how things were coming along and if I had any questions, etc. Most companies collect your money and you don't hear from until the week before the wedding. I love that A. they only do weddings. That's what they specialize in! B. Their website is geared to help you! There is an online planner where you can pick out songs you would like to hear during the ceremony or reception. How cool is that? On the day of, Tony, arrived to the venue a few hours in advance to set up. It was the ONE thing I didn't have to worry about that day because he had EVERYTHING under control. "Tony, how will the wedding party know when to walk out during the ceremony?!" "Take a deep breathe. They will see my cue and know to start." "OH, okay." Like I said, he knew what he was doing! Tony did a fantastic job entertaining our guests with his selection of music. I couldn't be more happier with their services & highly recommend them for your wedding!

My wife and I recently hired Tony (Nor Cal Pro Sound) for our wedding in November 2012. While we thought we were simply hiring a DJ, Tony ended up being so much more, including an ...

MC, keeping the entire event moving throughout the night. We’ve been to weddings in the past that have seemed disorganized; Tony on the other hand took control and worked in perfect concert with the Coordinator and other Vendors to keep everything on track. The entire experience with Nor Cal Pro Sound was straightforward. Upon hiring Tony, he gave us access to his online planning tool where we were able to share ideas regarding music, with the ability to specify specific songs for different parts of the evening. Tony takes that insight, and crafts specific playlists for each part of the event (Pre Ceremony, Ceremony, Dinner, Dancing, etc). A short phone conversation after we’d used the planning tool was all it took for Tony to understand our preferences. The best part about the whole experience is with a limited direction, Tony captured exactly what we were looking for. Several guests came up to us during dinner and commented on the music, complimenting the selections. When it came time to for dancing, Tony had the whole party up and moving. Once again, having been to weddings with subpar DJs, reading the vibe of the group is the key in keeping everyone dancing. Tony excels at this and by the end of the night, we had impromptu dance-offs between Uncles and Friends and the entire group (120+) belting out Eddie Money “Take Me Home Tonight” to end the night. Tony hit a homerun. In our minds, you cannot go wrong with hiring Tony and Nor Cal Pro Sound to MC/DJ your event. He came highly recommended and will be missed in Northern California. Take our advice, look no further.
