d our final walk through call, he understood the assignment. He had our toast list and kept the microphone on lockdown (per our request). He guided guests through every part of the night, mic'd up our officiant, and took our inspiration Spotify playlists to make an amazing musical experience. Not only that, he was FUN! So great to talk to, so easy and fun to work with. We loved him!

p of the way. Once we got assigned our DJ who would be working the wedding, we worked exclusively with him to plan the details of our big day. Carlos was our DJ and we cannot recommend him (or thank him) enough! He was so easy to work with and answered questions for us before we even knew to ask them. During the ceremony, cocktail hour, dinner and dancing, he was always right in line with what the guests wanted to hear! We had guests that never left the dance floor the entire night. We got multiple compliments on our vendors, but Carlos received the most raves BY FAR. To the point that we have shared how to get in contact with him with several guests. I highly recommend Runaway DJ - ask for Carlos - and will absolutely be referring any and all friends their way!

We couldn't have been happier with the DJ we chose for our wedding. Runaway DJ was a recommendation from our photographer, Sarah Peterson. From the start, their communication was e...

xceptional, making planning a breeze. They even worked with our venue’s wedding coordinator to ensure they met the venue’s sound requirements before we signed our DJ contract with them. They provided a worksheet that helped us organize our music preferences, ensuring there were no surprises on the day of. We had two scheduled phone calls: one initial phone meeting to discuss our vision and one phone meeting a few weeks before our wedding to finalize the run of show. Most of our communications were through email, where our DJ (David Craven) efficiently responded every time. During our last phone meeting, we reviewed the DJ worksheet and were able to specify specific songs/music for each part of our special day. On the day of the wedding, David arrived nice and early to set up sound for the outdoor ceremony, patio cocktail hour, and indoor reception. He seamlessly incorporated our requests and quickly found any songs we asked for. He even went above and beyond by working with our officiant (a family member), ensuring the ceremony's processional timing and microphone volume was perfect. For the ceremony, David provided a lavalier mic for our officiant, allowing her to be hands-free and ensuring her words were heard clearly. He also provided our officiant with a wireless microphone to hold for us while we each said our written vows so our guests could hear them clearly. During the ceremony, he flawlessly transitioned between our two processional songs and one recessional song, creating a beautiful and memorable moment. The lighting provided by the Runaway DJ was also fantastic, with lasers and uplighting creating a fun atmosphere that encouraged even the most reluctant dancers to hit the dance floor. Speaking of which, despite not being dancers ourselves, David had us and our guests dancing for hours! Overall, we couldn't have asked for a better DJ experience for our wedding.

At one point they played a song we weren't really feeling and all my wife had to do was shoot the dj the look and he faded it out and played a song that fit our vibe. That takes talent!!

We were communicating with one person the whole time leading up to the wedding and then we had someone else actually do the wedding so it would have been nice if we had been able to meet with that person beforehand. We got rained on halfway through but our DJ was able to quickly relocate the equipment so that there wasn't a lull in the music. Solid choice for a DJ!

We got married at Deer Park Villa, and Runaway DJ set up their sound system, so they are the go-to choice for this venue. If you're getting married at DPV, they are an easy vendor ...

to mark off your to-do list. But they weren't perfect (and honestly it was fine). We had our final meeting with our DJ about a month before the wedding, which was probably too early. Despite our wedding coordinator giving everyone a schedule of events, the DJ still managed to screw up the order of the first dances... There were a couple of other minor issues, but generally he was very friendly and people liked him. I created a playlist for the wedding that he used almost exclusively, so I can't speak to his curation of music abilities.

Runaway DJ was the absolute BEST! Working with David is so easy and helpful. They sent us DJ Armin to host our wedding and he was phenomenal. Armin was such a professional and knew...

how to keep things moving along at the right pace. Everything from the mic'ing up for the ceremony, the toasts, special dances and party, Armin made it all happen so seamlessly. He was engaging, kind, and most of all he made my bride and I feel like we're the only wedding that has ever mattered to him even though he does many weddings professionally. We didn't feel, in any way, that we were just another gig, but rather the stars of the show. We had a lot of unique songs to be played at certain moments of the event, including a song from a Muppets movie and a specific live version of a Grateful Dead song, as well as a few obscure instrumental versions of popular songs. Armin found all of the songs, listened ahead of time and made sure they were included as special moments in the event. Our guests were never going to be to biggest dancers, but Armin got everyone engaged immediately. There are moments on that dance floor I will always remember. I also want to thank him for playing my parents' wedding song 'Cruisin'. If your looking for a team of professionals that really prioritize YOU on your most special day, Runaway DJ, especially DJ Armin, is the way to go.

They were truly the vendor that got me the most excited for our wedding. DJ Ed was fantastic!! We had a hour long phone call a few weeks before the wedding and went through every detail imaginable. He was so personable and enthusiastic and I knew he would make our day come together perfectly. Wedding day came and he KILLED it. We got so many compliments on Ed and everyone loved how much energy he gave to every song. We also rented a photobooth through Runaway and it was a total hit. If you’re someone like me who’s indecisive and struggled with wedding planning - this company is the one for you. We trusted them to bring their own ideas to the table and they blew it out of the water!!

of our playlist and pretty much played everything that was a must hear, while at the same time being able to pivot based on the crowd’s response. He made the night about us, which not all DJ’s do. Not to mention his attitude was positive and his excitement for all things music was infectious! A true professional. My only critique is I was not a fan of the colorful disco lights on the dance floor – but no one else seemed to care…they were too busy dancing and enjoying themselves : ) Thank you DJ Ed!

I loved working with DJ David Craven for my recent wedding! He came highly recommended by our venue and I am so glad we took the recommendation - DJ Craven brought the party! Fro...

m even our initial interview/discussion, I could tell that DJ Craven was the type of DJ I was looking for - we spoke with other DJs who were pushing various games or activities, but DJ Craven truly believed in "our day, our way" and did not push any sort of game or activity on us. His music taste seemed to gel with ours and he got our intended vibe and feel much quicker than anyone else we spoke with. We also decided to have him do some lights on our dance floor, which were absolutely worth the extra money. In the days leading up to our wedding, DJ Craven checked in with us, helped us pull our music selections together, and did a final consultation to ensure that everything was on track. The day of our wedding, DJ Craven showed up in plenty of time to set up and have music going when guests started arriving (my mom had told people to expect really bad traffic, so we had some early arrivals). He did a fantastic job with our rather unique ceremony choices (my now-husband decided to to rick roll the wedding as our recessional song) and was a great MC for the evening throughout the reception. When we transitioned to the indoor part and as the evening got later, DJ Craven was very understanding and accommodating of the guests' desire to change the music to a much more dance/hip hop vibe and looked for the various songs we requested. I would highly recommend going with DJ Craven for your wedding! Not only is he just a really nice and cool guy, he will do a fantastic job with everything for your wedding!

the songs we wanted played during cocktail hour and dancing we made up our own playlists and shared it with him. David took all of this into consideration and had people on the dance floor the whole night long.

We're also very glad we went with Runaway since they knew our venue (Deer Park Villa) so well!

reached out to him and throughout the entire planning process. He supplied all of the necessary equipment for our ceremony and speeches. He had everyone on the dance floor from the first song to the last. He played all of the songs that we asked him to play, and also took and played guests' requests. He was completely in tune with the crowd - knowing when to play which song. Everyone told us how much fun they had at our wedding, in large part because David was amazing. If you are looking for a great DJ and fun night - David is your guy!!!

We were both thrilled with DJ David Craven from Runaway DJ, and I very highly recommend him! He was great to work with from start to finish - always so friendly and easygoing, but ...

also extremely professional. Most importantly, he was fantastic at our actual wedding, and we had multiple guests come up to us during and after to tell us how great they thought he was. He was a total pro at reading the room and honoring our guests' requests without straying too far from what we wanted, which was not an easy task since there was a wide range of tastes there for such a small wedding. One thing that really stuck out to me was when someone said to me on the dance floor, "I love how much fun he's having. He's singing along to every song, and I love it!" It didn't matter if it was 80's, current top 40, or country, David was singing and dancing and made you believe he loved every single song. He didn't have to use any cheesy lines or anything to get people on the floor, he just looked like he was having such a great time, you wanted to join him. It created such a great atmosphere, and it kept everyone that was dancing excited and really into the music. I will also say that his level of service and the talent involved is an incredible value for the price. There were several vendors/services that we wished afterward we had maybe gone a little cheaper on, but definitely not Runaway DJ. While I honestly hadn't understood before the wedding how valuable a good DJ was, afterward we both felt that this was one area where we were 100% satisfied. His rate was a little less than another very highly recommended DJ we talked to, and he went above and beyond to make everything great. He brought an assistant to keep everything running smoothly, he answered all emails really quickly, spent time on the phone with me to go over details as needed, and even made a site visit to check out the venue beforehand. If I ever have another event where I need a DJ, I would absolutely go straight to Runaway, and I very highly recommend them to anyone looking for a DJ now.

We visited the Sonoma area in June 2014 in search of a wedding venue, and during this process it seemed as if everyone at every place we visited highly recommended calling DJ David...

Craven at Runaway DJ before he booked up for the summer. As soon as we booked our venue, we booked DJ David I am so glad that we did because he did a truly wonderful job at our wedding. First of all, David was super cool and so easy to work with. My husband and I had some very specific requests but David went above and beyond to make us happy. We met with him at his home office to discuss everything before the wedding and he really made it happen on the big day. This included playing plenty of incredibly obscure song requests from our guests. It was pretty great! One of our biggest concerns beforehand was that it might be hard to keep people on the dance floor, considering we had an intimate wedding of 40 guests flying in from all over the country. So I was absolutely stunned that the dance floor was packed the whole night!! David played hit after hit and really brought everyone to their feet and kept them there all night. The photo booth was an absolute smash as well (our guests are still talking about how much fun they had with it) and he is sending us a flash drive with all of the photos on it. So if you're looking for a DJ who is calm, collected, funny, really knows how to get the party started and will keep people on their feet until the end of the night look no further than DJ David Craven at Runaway DJ!
