Description

Nothing says chic more than this stylish two piece ensemble created from our Jade Chiffon. The sophisticated long-sleeve top has a bateau neckline adorned with Beaded Embroidered Lace detail throughout the shoulders and a high-covered back. The attached chiffon belt defines the waist and the flowing asymmetrical edge adds interest to the top. The flowy pants will ensure you have the comfort and versatility that's simply irresistible.
