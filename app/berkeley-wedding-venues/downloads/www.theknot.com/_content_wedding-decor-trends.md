Flowers and venues do some heavy lifting to set a wedding's tone, but decor is what creates an atmosphere and experience for guests. Think of how sparse your home would appear with no rugs, candles, art or keepsakes to breathe life into the space. Our top wedding decor trends for 2026 are those that recall a range of bygone eras—or rather, centuries. We've seen trending wedding decorations in years past dip into the slick Art Deco lines of the '20s, the kitschy whimsy of the '50s, and the funky disco energy of the '60s and '70s. But in 2026, the latest trends in wedding decor are all about opulence and excess as the pendulum swings forward to pull inspiration from the '80s (ask your parents to bust out their wedding album) and _way_ back, as the grandiosity of Rococo style and late Renaissance period are coming into play. The latter often appears in the form of Botticelli-like shell decor and moody fruit woven into tablescapes like a Dutch Masters painting. Pops of silver will also add sparkle and splendor to celebrations. And even more-minimalist wedding designs will feel layered and sumptuous.

An eclectic flood of fresh fruits and veggies made their way into wedding centerpieces in 2025, and this trend shows no signs of slowing down when it comes to 2026 wedding table trends. It's all about sultry stone fruits these days, like cherries and peaches as well as moody, more fine-art coded fruits like drapey bunches of grapes, plump persimmons and juicy pomegranates. They might also be mixed with unexpected, textural vegetables like cabbages or artichokes and even mushrooms. 

FEATURED VIDEO FROM THE KNOT

"I think fruit, veggies and bread will start taking more of an integral role in design," said Amy Lynn Parmar, lead wedding planner at [Poppy + Lynn](https://poppyandlynn.com/) in NYC, of this trend last year. "The idea of the intimate dinner party with fresh, lush food is growing. Fresh produce also feels reminiscent of still-life art, which I think has an innate level of luxury." Also, don't be surprised to see bejeweled produce adorning tables—because a pear looks prettier studded with pearls, no?

## 2\. Sparkling Silver Touches

In particular, tablewares with chrome, pewter and silver finishes will be adding sparke to 2026 wedding catering tables. Allison Holton-Gamiz, lead planner at and founder of [WEST Events](https://westeventsla.com/), attributes this wedding decor trend to motifs from the Victorian era bubbling up: "Victorian influences will reemerge through [details like] silver dishware, candelabras and fine art signage—it's all about romance, artistry and a touch of historical drama," she says. "Silver candelabras bring timeless elegance, especially when mixed with modern elements."

Antique silver servingware will be showing off charcuterie and more, from large platters to petite butter dishes. Those with scalloped edges, ornate borders and shell shapes will be especially popular. And on the flip side, keep an eye out for shimming bits of '80s-inspired (more on that decade later in our list of new trends in wedding decor) chrome appearing in weddings with more modern, minimalist aesthetics.

## 3\. Fine Art-Inspired Details

Wedding decor is moving toward the artistic side of the design spectrum in 2026, both figuratively and literally. On one hand, wedding designers will embrace organic and sculptural shapes to craft a more expressive, avant-garde approach to styling their wedding aesthetics. 

Lara Zhang, owner of and lead planner at [By Lara](https://www.bylara.ca/), notes that "soft, sculptural installations" will emerge, specifically, "oversized textiles or drapes, suspended abstract elements or hand-crafted details." Elements like these remind us of the pieces we would see at a contemporary gallery, where everything is sophisticated, textured and a little architectural. 

A traditional iteration of this trend is coming forth as well, where the look and feel of rich oil paintings and fine art pieces is threaded through the wedding aesthetic. In some cases, this shows up literally, with paintings in gilded frames popping up on seating charts and more.

## 4\. The Return of the '80s

![Dining table set up](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/077e009e-648a-4aae-a4c3-7ba76c0e6c88~rs_768.h-cr_0.61.916.1282)

As aforementioned, the 80s are a standout on our roster of wedding decor trends for 2025. Specifically, touches of shiny, luxe taffeta. We'll see it skirting tables, delicately pleated at the top as well as wound into big fluffy bows. These are a sumptuous sister of the delicate ribbons that wound around coupe glass stems and taper candle holders early last year, bringing whimsy to everything from centerpieces, to bar displays, to chair backs. 

### Find your kind of venue

From barns to ballrooms, discover reception venues that feel like you.

But that's not the only way the "decade of decadence" is showing up in weddings. Lauren Gordon, owner and director of marketing and communications at [Cherish Events](https://www.cherish-events.com/), predicts that the mirrored surfaces, chrome details and geometric glassware popularized during the period will resurface. Zhang mentions that a subtle nod to the style will come through via patterns and hues: "Warm or cool tones and some playful retro references in tableware and lighting will be popular," she says.

## 5\. Swans Galore

One of this wedding editor's favorite pieces of trending wedding decor for 2026: swans. I saw some glimmerings of the graceful birds appear in 2025, but they're surfacing more and more in the gorgeous weddings that come across my desk. This trend would technically be part of the '80s revival movement that weddings are embracing in 2026, but these graceful birds are doing everything from topping cakes, displaying food and adding flair to trending wedding centerpieces, so they deserve a separate entry. They strike the perfect balance between vintage kitsch and classic elegance.

## 6\. Drapey, Romantic Linens 

![Drapey, Romantic Linens](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/dc0f8ee8-ae08-4463-96a8-4cf5b0acffb3~rs_768.h-cr_0.177.1414.2062)

Fabric can (and will) do more than cloak tables and partition off venues. Anticipate linens to be twisting, draping and cascading everywhere. The wedding design and decor idea feels soft and sumptuous, with a focus on luxe fabrics. You'll see the trend take shape as billowy white drapes that make an outdoor reception feel secluded and elegant as well as twisty table runners that add dimension to dinner spreads.

"In 2026, drapery is the unsung hero of wedding decor," says Holton-Gamiz, who mentions that billowed silk and ruched linens are set to be iconic wedding trends, on par with the bow and the disco ball. "Couples are layering soft fabrics everywhere—cascading from ceilings, sweeping across entryways and flowing over tabletops to transform even simple spaces into lush, romantic retreats. Think: velvet napkins, billowing sheers catching the light, creating warmth and intention at every turn. Draping instantly elevates a venue and makes it feel intimate and fully designed."

Samantha O'Donnell, founder and creative director of [Lavish Haus Events](https://www.lavishhausevents.com/), echoes that custom linens and layered draping will be big 2026 wedding decor trends: "I really think draping is making a strong and bold statement lately, but in a more intentional, custom way."

_[Photo/Embroidery: Ethereal Thread Co.](https://etherealthreadco.com/)_

From napkins, to tablecloths, to ribbons, to handkerchiefs (not to mention: veils), embroidery is one of the most darling wedding decor trends of 2026. It stems from modern couples' proclivity for personalization and the swing toward handcrafted and homey elements. In particular, we're noticing sweet stitching on custom wedding signs, whether they're displayed at the entrance to the ceremony or hung above the head table. And because these wedding decorations are bonafide pieces of art, they can (and will) make for very special home decor after the nuptials.

## 8\. Warm, Accent Lighting

Remember when the sentiment of "we don't turn on the big lights" blew up in the interior design corners of the internet? The rule has carried over to weddings. Between petite restaurant-style lamps and statement table lamps that create an atmosphere, the cozy, lived-in glow of home-inspired accent lighting will set the mood in 2026. The reason why these little lamps are up and coming? The continued shift toward weddings that feel like intimate dinner parties held at one's home. 

"Mini lamps, clusters of candles and layered lantern lighting are becoming key design elements rather than simple accents," says Ashley Vasek, creative director and event manager at [Cherish Events](https://www.cherish-events.com/). "These soft, glowing details allow couples to shape the atmosphere, whether it be romantic, cozy or dramatic, with intention. In 2026, lighting design will be viewed as a central part of the overall decor." O'Donnell notes that custom, bistro-style lighting is on the rise to enhance the mood of a space and visual storytelling, while Zhang mentions that lighting will skew warm and layered to build an intimate atmosphere. 

"Soft, warm amber lighting continues to be the most flattering and romantic choice, but table lamps are having a major moment," says Holton-Gamiz. "They add a cozy, intimate light that feels really current and it completely shifts the atmosphere in the best way."

Ice sculptures are back—and they're chicer than ever. Gone are the LED-lit iterations of the early 2000s, they're being replaced by some sculptures that evoke the opulent kitsch of the '80s, and others that are sleek, sharp and unequivocally of the modern moment. Some even serve as slick ways to keep cold appetizers like oysters chilled in a way that's much more eyecatching than a trough full of cubes. Whether for form or for function, we're here for the ice-sculpture renaissance.

In 2026, couples will lean into deeply personal decor elements to create a mood and energy that represents who they are. And while this _is_ a trend, we think it's timeless. 

"Designs are chosen to reflect each couple's personality and story rather than following trends," says Zhang. "The emphasis is on creating meaningful, memorable and unique experiences that feel authentic and truly one-of-a-kind." Gordon notes that she's seeing lovebirds incorporate sentimental touches on their tables, specifically, placing a personalized, handwritten note at each attendee's seat and incorporating intentional escort items that also serve as favors or keepsakes. 

"Place cards, paper goods and tabletop details are more elevated than ever, often doubling as keepsakes," says O'Donnell. "It's less about over-the-top decor and more about thoughtful layering and meaningful design moments." Holton-Gamiz agrees, adding that these keepsake touches at the table—from notes, to mini art prints, to Polaroids tucked into napkin folds—cultivate connection and pack emotional weight: "I find that couples want spaces that feel deeply personal, filled with nostalgic decor, keepsakes and artistic choices that reflect who they are," she says. "The kind of details you can look at in a photo and immediately know they couldn't belong to anyone else, maybe because they came straight from your home, made by your own hands or from the heart."

## 11\. Lush Renaissance/Old European Vibes

A sect of the aforementioned fruit-and-vegetable centerpiece trend is part of an overall push toward a luxurious European Renaissance-inspired design aesthetic. Layered textiles, candles, lots of texture, classical motifs from ancient Greece and Rome and feast-like food stations are hallmarks. Moody stone fruit, food arranged in a way that feels bountiful, yet unfussy, and ornate candelabras will all help drive the vibe home. This richer, cozier iteration of European-inspired design feels as if it's in response to the light and bright affairs of years past. 

"We're seeing a pull toward European classicism: old-world charm with a modern edge," says O'Donnell. "Couples are leaning into timeless elegance with curated materials, rich textures, and architectural details that feel both storied and sophisticated."

Holton-Gamiz mentions that this trend is manifesting because of the heightened desire for weddings that feel like entry points into other worlds. Ornate flourishes that recall tapestries and illuminated manuscripts as well as moody historic architecture will all have a more prominent presence in 2026, according to the expert.

## 12\. Rococo Revival

![2026 wedding decor ideas](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/d8a14c86-3ce5-4841-ad7c-04136cdefdd8~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.530.706)

We've seen the frilly, gilded, opulent details of the so-called "coquette" aesthetic take hold in recent years, and the lavishly romantic style will take shape as a full blown revival of the Rococo period of the mid 18th century. This art and design movement was all about curving filigree, candy-colored pastels and whimsical depictions of leisure. And now, we're seeing it appear in wedding decor as a general style as well as with recurring motifs that were popular during the period, such as cherubs.

## 13\. Lush, Layered Tablescapes

"2026 dinner tables will be unapologetically maximalist," says Holton-Gamiz. "Couples are leaning into a bold, sensory, layered look that celebrates abundance rather than restraint." Richly layered menus with texture, unexpected table numbers and sculptural lamps will be defining elements of the trend, according to the wedding planner. She says: "Couples want their dinner tables to feel like an experience: maximal, immersive and expressive." O'Donnell also notes that tablescapes will continue to skew maximalist, even if the rest of the event's design is pared down.

## 14\. Residential Decor That's Cozy and Curated

If 2026 wedding decor trends prove anything, it's that luxury means paying attention to the small details that are bespoke and special to you—just like you would in your home. Zhang says that statement rugs and bespoke furniture are making their way into ceremony lounges and cocktail setups, giving weddings a "curated, lived-in feel." O'Donnell agrees, adding: "Couples are treating their wedding like a high-end interior project: every material, texture and finish is carefully considered." Holton-Gamiz also underscores that cozy and homey as defining factors of a wedding are becoming increasingly important. Everything will feel soft and warm and lived-in, not cookie cutter, in 2026.

## 15\. Seashell Accents

Yes, seashells are back in weddings. And no, they're not reminiscent of the little scallop-shaped soaps in your grandma's bathroom you were never allowed to use. Rather, the 2026 iteration of shell decor is chic, elegant and relies on the natural beauty, organic shapes and pearlescent shimmer of the little treasures. They can be used as escort cards for sure, but also are manifesting in more creative ways. For example, little "coupe" cocktail glasses where a shell serves as the cup portion of the glass are decking out tables. They look like something a siren would sip from.

## 16\. Lace and Textural Textiles

_[Photo: FOOLISHLY RUSHING IN](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/foolishly-rushing-in-anaheim-ca-1067578)_

Taking the aforementioned wedding draping trend into account, it's no surprise that textiles in general are having a major moment. "Texture play, such as fresh-from-the-farm wool and silk, will continue to inspire dramatic, yet unique and memorable spaces," says Zhang. In addition to the more natural textiles mentioned, we predict that a lace renaissance will be on the horizon for 2026—particularly in the form of trim, tapestries and tablecloths.

## 17\. An Art Gallery-Like Design Approach

_[Photo: Alex Mari Photography](https://www.alexmariphotography.com/),__[Planning: By Lara](https://www.bylara.ca/)_

In 2026, one proliferating decor approach for weddings is similar to that of an art gallery—meaning: the spaces are sparse, the trappings are minimalist, but every piece is carefully chosen and tells a story. Think of it as "minimal clutter, maximal intention." 

"I see a kind of duality emerging: Minimalist in terms of clutter, maximalist in the storytelling of each piece," says Zhang. "Spaces will feel more experiential and less predictable, like a gallery where each installation invites touch and engagement. Every piece is deliberate, tactile and layered. While the aesthetic may feel restrained at first glance, there's a richness that reveals itself upon closer inspection."
