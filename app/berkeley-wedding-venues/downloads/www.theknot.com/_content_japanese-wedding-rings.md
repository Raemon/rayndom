Japanese wedding rings have a lot in common with the wedding rings most popular in American culture: They're worn on the same wedding ring finger, often crafted from the same metals and worn by both men and women. "They represent an eternal bond, eternal love," says Satomi Kawakita, the founder and creative director of [Satomi Kawakita Jewelry](https://satomikawakita.com/), which has showrooms in New York and Tokyo. "The difference I find is that people in Japan don't wear engagement rings daily. They wear them only for special occasions, and tend to choose smaller stones compared to the people in the US." Wedding bands, though worn more frequently, are understated and often feature handcrafted detailing that gives them an organic feel.

Here, Kawakita and Yoshinobu Kataoka, the founder and designer of [kataoka Jewelry](https://www.kataoka-jewelry.com/en/), help us dive into the history and symbolism of traditional Japanese wedding rings and peg a few favorite styles that fit the bill.

## Do Japanese Couples Wear Wedding Rings?

Yes, Japanese couples wear wedding rings similarly to American couples, but the [Japanese engagement ring](https://www.theknot.com/content/japanese-engagement-rings) tradition is subtly different. "Customs in Japan increasingly mirror Western practices," Kataoka says. "Engagement rings, often featuring solitaire diamonds, are commonly given—either chosen together as a couple or presented during a proposal." Engagement rings are noticeably less flashy than their Western counterparts—"many women think that wearing a large or sparkling diamond ring to work is inappropriate," Kawakita says—and are worn only for special occasions. "Wedding bands are then exchanged during the marriage ceremony," Kataoka continues. "In some cases, the fiancé also gifts a wristwatch in return." Engagement rings and wedding bands are worn by both parties on the left-hand [wedding ring finger](https://www.theknot.com/content/ring-finger-what-hand-wedding-engagement-ring).

## Japanese Wedding Rings Tradition & History

In many cultures, rings in perfect circles are a symbol of eternal and everlasting love; wearing them is a symbol of a couple's commitment to each other. Japanese culture is no exception, but the tradition doesn't date back as far as you might think. "[Offering an engagement ring] is a custom that spread under the influence of Western culture after World War II, and today many men give diamond rings as a symbol of engagement," Kawakita says. "However, not everyone chooses to do so, and recently, more couples have come to think that having only wedding rings is sufficient and more practical." Kataoka concurs. "Today, while influenced by Western conventions, Japanese couples often approach rings as expressions of elegance, personal style, and refined taste rather than obligation," he says. "Ideally, wedding rings convey promise, commitment and enduring love. In practice, they also serve as subtle social markers, signifying marital status and participation in the shared journey of partnership."

## What to Look For in Japanese Wedding Bands

Though the tradition is not that different from Western wedding ring traditions, the [types of wedding rings](https://www.theknot.com/content/rings-for-diamond-shapes) themselves are quite different. Japanese engagement rings are more subdued, and wedding bands are textural and organic. [Japanese ring designers](https://www.theknot.com/content/japanese-engagement-rings) also sometimes lean into symbolic motifs. To find rings for your [Japanese wedding](https://www.theknot.com/content/japanese-wedding-traditions), search [The Knot Vendor Marketplace](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/jewelers) and filter by Asian-owned jewelers. Here are a few elements to look out for.

### Platinum 

![Platinum wedding rings](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/f189b435-ba25-42bf-8feb-ddbb6617e119~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.774.774)

_Photo: Fujimori Kajita_

"Platinum is by far the most popular choice in Japan," Kawakita says. "It is valued for its durability, pure white shine and symbolism of unchanging purity. Platinum's resistance to tarnish is also associated with long-lasting love."

### Small Diamonds

Though Japanese engagement rings are far less showy than American engagement rings, they do often contain a central diamond, even if it's less than one carat or one-half carat. Bands occasionally contain a tiny hidden diamond or sprinkled diamond detailing.

### Texture

_Photo: Jaume Labro_

Many wedding bands by Japanese designers have textured metal, giving the look an organic, handcrafted appeal. More specifically, you'll often find a wood-grain pattern on Japanese wedding bands, which dates back to an ancient technique known as mokume gane that was used to decorate samurai swords.

### Organic Motifs

![Organic motif wedding band](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/17f0982f-0848-414f-b26c-6066c3c3f567~rs_768.h-cr_357.0.1850.1120)

_Photo: Niwaka_

Japanese-style wedding bands often go one step further than texture with an engraved motif. Tidal waves, koi fish or organic leaves and florals are common motifs you may find in a Japanese wedding ring. "Designs often embrace minimalism and understated sophistication," Kataoka says. "Nature-inspired motifs, such as cherry blossoms or delicate petals, appear alongside refined milgrain detailing, drawing on traditional craft while remaining contemporary."

## Japanese Wedding Rings for Men

A Japanese men's wedding band can be rendered in any metal and feature any design and texture, but there are a few favorites that stand out. "Most of our customers choose what looks good on their skin," Kawakita says. "Many men choose our white gold because we don't use rhodium plate on white gold, so it's a very warm color that blends well with Asian skin tones." Here are a few Japanese men's wedding bands we love.

### kataoka Square Adamas Ring

![kataoka Square Adamas Ring](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/36c939af-f773-4bf1-80df-2d05641334b9~rs_768.h-cr_133.0.1386.940)

_Photo: kataoka_

"Men generally favor understated bands in platinum or gold," Kataoka says. "These pieces convey quiet strength and distinction, embodying refinement without ornamentation." His Square Adamas ring has beveled edges and a burnished finish, and features a hidden diamond within.

### Satomi Kawakita Organic Textured Band

_Photo: Satomi Kawakita_

"This is one of our newest wedding bands, and it's getting very popular," Kawakita says. "Our customers like bands that are simple, but have a slight texture, something a little different from others." The unisex style comes in two widths: a more masculine 6mm style or a more feminine 3.8mm. 

[From $1,360 | Satomi Kawakita](https://satomikawakita.com/products/mr0133)

### Jaume Labro Jason Minimalist Mokume Wedding Band

For an ultra-subtle nod toward culture, this men's ring keeps to Japanese wedding ring tradition with a mokume gane finish on the inside, hidden beneath a polished exterior. It's available in white, yellow or rose gold and platinum, and customers can even [choose a wedding ring](https://www.theknot.com/content/rules-for-choosing-your-wedding-bands) with a combination of metals making up the interior hues. 

[From $2,670 | Jaume Labro](https://www.jaumelabro.com/products/mokume-gane-rings/ilios-gold-mokume-wedding-bands/)

### Niwaka Hanagasumi Ring

This wide 6mm Japanese wedding band features sakura flowers—cherry blossoms—engraved in platinum as an ode to the springtime. (The ring's name, Hanagasumi, refers to the mist-like effect created by abundant flower petals.) A white gold border completes the intricate piece. 

[From $2,460 | Niwaka](https://us.niwaka.com/products/wedding-rings-hanagasumi-3197ha)

### Satomi Kawakita 5.3 mm Valley Band 

![Satomi Kawakita 5.3 mm Valley Band](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/48d522b4-9554-4746-8635-89294934900d~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1100.1100)

_Photo: Satomi Kawakita_

One of the brand's original designs and still a bestseller, the Valley Band has a unique concave silhouette that sets it apart in a sea of same-same wedding bands. It's available in white, yellow or rose gold or platinum, and has a subtly textured, handmade feel. 

[From $3,231 | Satomi Kawakita](https://satomikawakita.com/products/5-point-3-mm-valley-band?variant=33590397763629)

## Japanese Wedding Rings for Women

For their engagement rings, Japanese women typically wear a small solitaire diamond. When it comes to wedding rings, though, their bands follow much the same pattern as men's: simple, textured or engraved designs in any hue of gold or platinum. "Women choose yellow gold and white gold equally," Kawakita says. Here are a few minimalist styles that make a big impact. 

### kataoka Stardust Ring

![kataoka Stardust Ring](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/902c3c70-8834-4689-a55d-69184e87478f~rs_768.h-cr_133.0.1386.940)

_Photo: kataoka_

"For daily life, a slim, delicate wedding band, sometimes adorned with subtle details, is most typical," Kataoka says. "Across designs, the emphasis remains on beauty, balance and craftsmanship, honoring grace over grandeur." This minimalist band has a subtle shimmer forged through a rough textured finish. 

[From $2,200 | kataoka](https://www.kataoka-jewelry.com/en/categories/wedding-bands/stardust-ring/)

### Fujimori Kajita Daylight Ring

![Fujimori Kajita Daylight Ring](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/a5d8f9e3-6db6-4c92-869a-4d631134bd79~rs_768.h-cr_0.225.1345.1570)

_Photo: Fujimori Kajita_

Rendered in 18-karat rose gold with an icy blue diamond enmeshed in the silhouette, this ring is designed to reflect light softly off its hand-shaved texture—like daylight shining through a cloud. It's minimalistic yet organic, and has just the right amount of pop. 

[$2,350 | Fujimori Kajita](https://www.fujimorikajita.com/artisan-collection/daylight)

### Satomi Kawakita 3.9mm Herringbone Band 

![Satomi Kawakita 3.9mm Herringbone Band](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/9516086a-3dc0-47ae-a802-429a15feaa90~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1200.1200)

_Photo: Satomi Kawakita_

Satomi Kawakita's herringbone band is fresh and modern with a subtle nod toward Japanese culture. It looks especially good when paired with a simple solitaire, and that's by design. "Our rings are stackable, so people choose what looks good with the engagement ring," Kawakita says. "It depends on the person, but our customers like something a little different from others." 

[From $2,062 | Satomi Kawakita](https://satomikawakita.com/products/3-point-9-mm-herringbone-band?_pos=2&_psq=MR0120&_ss=e&_v=1.0)

### Tasaki Piano Black Diamond Ring

![Tasaki Piano Black Diamond Ring](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/1230619a-3f0a-4709-bb5c-78ec3f5f0972~rs_768.h-cr_660.0.1330.670)

_Photo: Tasaki_

For a unique take on a wedding band, this unisex style mixes modern rose gold with an inset black diamond and engraved markings. It makes a bold enough statement to be worn on its own for the day-to-day, when you may not be wearing your engagement ring.

### Brilliant Earth Mosaic Diamond Ring

_Photo: Brilliant Earth_

Though not by a Japanese ring designer, this Brilliant Earth style checks all the boxes: platinum construction, subtle detailing, and great for everyday wear. The scattering of diamonds in different sizes across the thin band lends a subtle sparkle.
