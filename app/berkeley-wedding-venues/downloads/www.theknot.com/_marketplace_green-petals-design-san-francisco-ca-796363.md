Working with Janelle and her team was one of the highlights of our wedding. From the initial proposal to coordinating our actual arrangements, she was attentive, detail-oriented, a...

nd flexible with us. Her selection of florals were beautiful but also practical given our outdoor venue, and her creative vision helped us bring our ideas to life. We added an additional order a few weeks prior for our welcome evening – all we gave her were the photos of the space, and the color palette – and Janelle’s natural talent and eye for design created the most beautiful arrangements. She was super flexible with us getting to keep the arrangements/vases after the events too - we reused our welcome evening & wedding centerpieces for our morning after brunch, and were able to return the vases to her later. We highly recommend working with Janelle, and hope we get the chance to work with her for future events!

our expectations. The flowers were absolutely gorgeous and received so many compliments from our guests. We were impressed by the attention to detail, the unique and rare flowers, and the way they perfectly complemented our colorful theme. Many guests even took flowers home to enjoy after the celebration. Janelle's professionalism and talent truly made our special day unforgettable. We also prioritized LGBT vendors, and Janelle fit the bill. Highly recommend!

Knot and Janelle was very responsive, even with my budget (some places just basically told me no, we don't work for that amount of money). We exchanged a few calls and emails, I sent her some photos of what I was envisioning and she pulled it off. We even had a last minute table increase and she was able to make that work, still within our budget. The bouquets and tablescapes were gorgeous and we could not have been happier. Thank you again Janelle!

ut the planning process and was wonderful to work with! As we neared our wedding day, Janelle stepped in to go over the fine details and placement of the flowers. She absolutely went above and beyond anything I envisioned! We were married at St. Dominic’s Catholic Church and our reception was held at the Mark Hopkins Hotel. Two locations for floral arrangements was pulled off seamlessly by Janelle and her team. The bouquets were in water at the church, the altar arrangements were stunning and perfectly placed, and the boutonnières were simple yet so elegant! I can’t say enough about the tall and short floral arrangements, floating candles and candelabras at our reception. They left everyone speechless. Discussing the various arrangements for months and playing around with color schemes is only a small glimpse as to the magnificent pieces of art that Janelle can create. You will most certainly be in awe over her creations for a wedding or any other special event! Janelle - thank you for making my wedding a sweet dream. You have incredible talent; thank you for your diligent work.

ue vibe that incorporated woodsy elements, moss and wildflowers. The team was really enthusiastic in creating an ambitious, highly detailed proposal months in advance and then somehow magically executed it in a breathtaking way. They worked closely with me on the final details, which included tree stumps decorated with charming mosses and candle scapes. I was truly impressed with the result and our guests could not get over the flowers either! Highly recommend Green Petal Designs for your event florals and decor - outstanding job.

Green Petal Designs is very reasonable in pricing as well. They truly made our wedding a magical event!

t to provide exactly what I was looking for. She gave me an itemized list and budget breakdown for each item, and was able to use my available budget to completely exceed my expectations (very helpful for a money-conscious bride). I gave her a few color scheme ideas and some guidance on what I was looking for and her creativity blew me away. Janelle even paid special attention to my request of adding tiger lilies in my bridal bouquet. We received many compliments on the arrangements. She also was easy to contact and quick to reply. It's been wonderful working with Janelle and we really can't say thank you enough!

based on our inspiration board, met with us to review our selections and clarify our vision, and continuously updated our proposal with changes or modifications as needed based on the evolution of our wedding design.

We had complicated floral arrangements and a unique and glorious floral arch for our ceremony and these were executed to perfection. Walking into our reception venue was a stunning experience because of the visual effect of all the beautiful floral arrangements. Janelle incorporated all our feedback and our requests and executed seamlessly. She was kind, patient, and collaborative. She reached out to our other vendors a needed to make a vision come true.

some of the most beautiful and fragrant flowers I've ever seen. We didn't have a lot of decorations, so the flowers were the key component that pulled the ceremony and reception spaces together. We have friends who are florists, who were in awe of the quality of flowers and beauty of the arrangements on the day-of. I can't recommend Janelle's team highly enough.

Having Green Petal Designs/Janelle as our floral designer for our wedding was one of the best decisions I made. I began talking to Janelle in May of 2021 for my November 2021 weddi...

ng. I was extremely impressed with the proposal/quote that she put together based on my initial request. The quote included images of potential flower designs with detailed descriptions regarding the various options, which really helped me get an idea of my vision on paper. We went over the proposal over the phone together and based on our conversation, I knew I needed Janelle for my wedding. My wedding was very small, and Janelle designed a ceremony half circle piece, boutonniere, bridal bouquet, cocktail centerpieces, reception centerpieces, and candles for the reception centerpieces. We went with an all-white floral design. I connected with Janelle again a few weeks before the wedding to finalize everything and I was able to make minimal changes based on our reception layout. Since we were having such a small wedding, we did not hire a coordinator. Janelle made sure to stay in communication with my fiancé and I regarding the day of timing. When Janelle arrived, she set things up BEAUTIFULLY. When I saw my bouquet, I almost cried because it was what I had always dreamed of. Each piece that she put together was gorgeous/exactly what we talked about and we received so many compliments from our guests regarding her work. I cannot say enough positive things about Green Petal Designs and Janelle.

Her candle rentals were also stunning. Our florals looked so luxurious and I can’t thank Janelle enough. I had thought that my budget would have limited what we could have done, but Janelle was able to make our day so incredibly beautiful at such a reasonable cost.

e dream to work with and not sure if we can put into words how thankful we are that we hired her for our big celebration. Our wedding was originally scheduled for 10/10/2020 and due to the pandemic, we had to push our reception to 2021. We took a break from planning due to the pandemic and we picked it back up in the beginning of 2021 and she didn’t miss a beat. Janelle really understood what we wanted, and she and her team really gave us the florals of our dreams while keeping us within budget! She was honest and upfront and there were never any costs there weren’t discussed and agreed upon first. She was extremely professional and was always available to answer any questions or concerns. Thank you, Janelle and team, for everything, we really appreciate it!
