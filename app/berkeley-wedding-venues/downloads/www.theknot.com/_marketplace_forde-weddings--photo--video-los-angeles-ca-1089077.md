g. We had a mixup on the weekend of our engagement shoot, and she/the team handled it so smoothly. Paul was incredible to work with that weekend - such a nice guy who made us feel so relaxed. We had so much fun experimenting with different types of photo ideas when we were shooting with him. Our wedding photographer, Hannah, was so awesome to work with on the day-of. Her energy was infectious and made the whole wedding party feel so relaxed. We met with her before the wedding, and she remembered so many details we discussed - it made me feel so seen! One of our favorite additions to the wedding was hiring an additional photographer to specifically capture portraits of our guests, and Orion delivered! It warmed our heart to see photos of our guests during moments that we missed while we were doing family portraits. The final photos were absolutely breathtaking. We told the team we mostly wanted candid moments captured, and they did a stellar job. We shared our album with our guests and they are still raving over the photo quality. We are all just so blown away by the raw JOY that was captured in the photos. We absolutely canNOT wait to get these photos framed. We cannot recommend Lauren and her team enough. They were so wonderful to work with throughout the whole process, and they fully delivered on the results. Thank you so much for the unforgettable memories!

r any questions we had and was always extremely friendly and heard us out about what we wanted for our wedding. There was not a single negative thing about the whole experience. Once the photos arrived I cried with excitement as they were exactly what we wanted. Moody/creative/artistic/scenic/thoughtful etc etc etc.... the photography and editing were 10/10. I have never looked at a photo of myself and loved it before until we received these photos back. Lauren was also extremely receptive of my husband wanting a specific change on a couple of photos and did that with no hesitation. It really felt like she TRULY wanted to make us happy with our photos whereas some other photographers are NOT like that and are only in it for the money. I am sad that I wont get to get married again and re-hire LDP as our wedding photography team as the experience and wedding day/trip was nothing short of a dream. Thank you again from the bottom of our hearts LDP.

My husband and I needed lots of posing and coaching and the photographers made us feel comfortable and definitely became part of the family that day! Not only did they capture us well, but the decor, the guests, and the genuine love can be felt through their creative work of our wedding.

My now husband and I found her while browsing Instagram and we instantly knew we needed to book her. She was one of our first vendors we booked (almost 2.5 years before our actual wedding), and from then on, working with her and her team was smooth and effortless. We had to postpone due to covid and she was extremely accommodating and made the entire process easy for us, especially in such a time of uncertainty. Onto the photos....they are absolutely stunning. They turned out better than we could have imagined and we are so so happy we chose Lauren to capture our special day. She followed up with us multiple times to ensure we were happy with the finished product, and we are SO in love with our gallery. We would highly recommend working with Lauren and her team!

ent of taking photos, my husband and I felt incredibly awkward and didn't know what to do with ourselves. (Not because of the team... we're just not used to taking photos) Somehow, that didn't show up in our final photos?! Earl Pelera and Kip Bowser was in charge of video. The video surprised me because more than half the time I didn't even notice them recording which was great. The photography team and videographers worked incredibly well together. At the end of the day, every time I look back at my gallery and videos, I catch myself with a smile on my face. They captured moments I didn't know happened and I am so grateful. I am beyond happy with who I chose for my photos and video. Thank you again! <3

About that reschedule…it was a location, date and time change on our end. We went from a trash the dress post Hawaii wedding to engagement shoot in Salt Lake City and she was able to accommodate and get our photos back in a very timely manner considering the reschedule, which we appreciated 100% Lauren set us with one photographer in Salt Lake City. She was super sweet and made us feel very comfortable. She had multiple poses planned and was our very own hype team. She was definitely a trooper being that it was in the snow at the end of January at sunset. Lauren set us up with two photographers and two videographers for our wedding in Oahu, Hawaii. The team of four were very professional and fun to work with. They worked very well together and captured our special day. We would recommend them to anyone.

le was exactly what we envisioned for our wedding. We loved that you could also book a videographer through her company as well! I will note that you should book them way in advance if you can because we almost didn’t get the date even over a year out and I’m so happy we did! Her and her team were rockstars and we had such a great experience with great people! Thank you again!

Lauren Dixon Photography made the entire wedding experience very smooth, and even worked closely with our wedding planner to make sure that we got the right photographer and shots ...

that we wanted. Whenever we had any questions, they responded very quickly and were always very helpful. Because this was a destination wedding for us, we weren't familiar with local vendors and they graciously linked us with whatever we needed. Wish they had photography for other things because we would love to work with them again!!

I can't believe it has taken me this long to get around to write my few reviews. My husband and I eloped in Hawaii in November 2019 and Lauren played such a huge role in making our...

day so special for us. For starters... I had never been to Hawaii but I described to Lauren my dream location and she had recommended Makapu'u Beach and all I can say is WOW. She literally brought my dream to life, my husband and I could not have picked a more perfect location if we tried it was everything we wanted and we have Lauren to thank for that. The entire process from the first time I reached out to Lauren up until the wedding day was so easy and stress free she was easy to work with and very professional. We hadn't done any engagement photos so I was a little nervous of how comfortable we'd be taking the photos and we seriously had SO much fun. Lauren was such a sweet, fun person who brought great energy and made us feel so comfortable the entire time. She is so talented, all the photos we have seen so far have brought tears to my eyes they are beautiful and make me want to go back and relive the day all over again. I would recommend Lauren to absolutely anyone, she is AMAZING!

She has such good energy!! She just makes it so easy for you to loosen up and as a result she captures the BEST candids. I had a ton of fun goofing off with her. She made me feel effortlessly beautiful. Our photos came out absolutely STUNNING! I can’t get over them and neither can our friends or family. Lauren is so artistic and INTUITIVE. Her pictures are so full of life she’s really a storyteller. Her pictures capture moments and memories not prom poses. She perfectly captured my husband and I’s relationship: playful and adventurous. Not only do I feel like we got the most incredible photos but I feel like I genuinely made a friend. Book her NOW! She’s worth every single penny!

tive vision of beautiful moments worth capturing. My husband and I aren’t too comfortable getting our picture taken because we always feel goofy and aren’t sure what to do but Lauren effortlessly got through our shy barrier and captured US. Her organic personality immediately showed like a ray of sunshine and totally relaxed my husband and me. She guided us through the entire shoot and the whole time it felt like we were just hanging out with a friend, who just so happened to be taking pictures of us. The way she captures a memorable moment is unlike anything I’ve ever experienced with other photographers. She went above and beyond for our photos and they’re something I will truly cherish forever.

orn session and so on. I found Lauren while I was researching destination photographers in Hawaii for our babymoon. Looking at her work I was so drawn to how effortlessly she captured each couple’s love for each other and how romantic it was. People say a picture is worth a thousand words and Lauren sure knows how to capture it! So without hesitation I booked Lauren and I thought how amazing it was that she worked with us and our location as I was I Maui and she was in Honolulu. Prior to us meeting, I shared with her what I wanted and what my vision was and Lauren definitely executed. I was 35 weeks pregnant and she made me feel so comfortable and pretty, which is a hard task at the stage in pregnancy. We got to know each other within such a short amount of time and she is so funny too! My husband and I kept on laughing and now I know why she’s able to capture a couple’s story. I highly recommend Lauren because she won’t let you down, whatever the occasion may be. She will make you feel at ease and you will feel so comfortable that your pictures will turn out amazing and not stiff at all. She won’t rush you and will make sure to capture the moment at every angle. Your wedding day is one of the most important days and every couple should have that day perfectly captured for a lifetime of memories. I only wished she was located in California because I would use her for all my life events!

n time and with so much energy and joy for the day that it was like one of my best friends came to shoot our wedding. Everything was perfectly organized with Lauren on our wedding day. She had the second shooter exactly where she needed to be, and she had all the details about how and what she was doing worked out. All I had to do was be in the day. As was the case with our engagement photo shoots, on our wedding day, Lauren shot and produced and edited absolutely stunning photos, well above the number she needed! She was prompt with photo delivery, excessive in the work she did for us, and enduringly joyful, professional, and artistic in her art. At the end of the night on our wedding, she found me, handed me a card, and gave me a huge hug. I sat down at the table and read the sweetest message from her and it is little gestures of grace like this that Lauren brings to the entirety of the experience with her. Everything is done with so much love, care, and thought that I cannot be grateful enough for her, especially as, no matter what my physical hang-ups about my looks were, Lauren, in every photo delivered, made me look and feel like a GODDESS birthed of Beyonce herself. If you want photos brimming with light, care, and art, as well as an experience that runs smoothly, goes FAR above your expectations (no matter how high they might be), and that makes you honestly feel like your best friend came into town to take photos of you, then Lauren is for you.

Lauren truly cares about her clients and our experience with her through the entirety of the wedding day reflected this at every point. She was completely on time, and never lagged...

in energy. She rolled with all the punches (a bird pooped in her mouth at one point and she shook it off like a CHAMPION) and whenever our wedding party or myself felt unsure what to do, she had prompts, suggestions, and ideas for us. There was even a moment where Lauren saw how nervous I was and walked me through a breathing exercise that really calmed me down. All the photos she produces (which are always greater in number then she needs to do) are professionally and thoughtfully edited and curated. She even gave us a card at the end of our day. The photo albums she produced for us were clear, crisp, and professionally styled. Both my wife and I agree, whole-heartedly, besides choosing to marry each other, Lauren was our absolutely best choice at our wedding.

auren after seeing some of her photos and this was one of the best decisions I've ever (yes, ever) made! We met Lauren in Malibu for the first time for our engagement photo shoot and it was oddly like picking up where you left off with an old friend. She was kind, funny, and super efficient. We were done in less than an hour and she produced some of the most beautiful pictures I have ever seen. My friends still rave about our photos and how it looks like something out of an editorial. Lauren was able to capture so much of my husband and my relationship in her pictures - it's such a rare talent, and I'm so lucky to have found her. I've sworn to myself that I'm going to get more pictures from Lauren if it's the last thing I do because I absolutely love anything she does!
