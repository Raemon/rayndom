Adding on the linens as it was our only rental was easy as well which helped us consolidate vendors. Payton was our DJ day of and was sweet, professional, and clearly knew how to MC the event well and naturally. They set the event up for success by allowing us to share playlists, timelines and notes ahead of a final call so we are aligned and the DJ can take the plans and run with it day of.

Much of that is due to Jason's understanding of how to create such a fun loving vibe! Thank you a million times over, Jason! We will never forget it.

We did not get to enjoy this company's services though they have kept ALL of our money. We signed a contract with Jason in 2019 for a 2020 wedding. Due to COVID we had to move it a...

few times. With the indoor mask mandates being reinstated in SF county, our venue only offering an indoor option, and the need to have multiple unvaccinated children at our wedding, we had to make the difficult decision to cancel our wedding. The increase in sick children with delta variant is not insignificant. Based on our contracts we've signed, we were only supposed to lose our $300 deposit, not the full sum. Jason has decided to write a "covid blog" and "covid policy" changing all of this and has decided to keep our money for himself. I do not recommend using this company. They do not follow the contracts they sign and retroactively apply policies to all previous contracts. Also, Jason does not reply to calls unless you call repeatedly and closer to 7pm. I do not recommend using this business.

I recently got married at the Brazilian Room and hired QPP for market lighting and a few rentals, including a sound system, chiavari chairs for our ceremony, and corn hole. Working...

with QPP and Jason was so easy. Jason was always quick to email me back whenever I had questions, had additional items to rent, or wanted to confirm timing. On the day of our wedding, the team showed up right on time to set everything up and were on time at the end of the night to take everything down--totally professional. The market lighting was absolutely beautiful both inside and outside, and the outside lighting allowed our guests to enjoy their drinks on the patio late into the evening. I seriously would not have wanted to have a wedding at the Brazilian Room without that lighting! Honestly, I have only one regret, which is that we didn't work with one of the caterers that Jason recommended when we first met him at the BR wedding fair--I should have listened to him! All in all, QPP was of the best vendors we hired for our wedding day, and I would highly recommend working with them.

We were referred to QPP by a friend and are so glad we were! We worked with Jason and had a great experience. He was extremely easy to talk to and very responsive at all hours. We ...

got a great deal for photobooth and DJ and probably would have gone with him for lighting as well, but our venue (Palm Event Center) only allowed preferred vendors. Hoping to see QPP on that list! Jason and his wife ended up being our photobooth attendants and they were such a blast to work with! They really know how to go with the flow and get people excited. We got so many compliments on how great the photobooth props were and how fun they made taking pictures (especially from all the older guests that were harder to entertain). They even came with their own materials to make a photo album for us that everyone signed! Jason even came out and rapped to a song on the dance floor and just got everyone hyped up. It was well timed, natural, and such a fun and memorable moment!

LOOK NO FURTHER. Quantum Party Productions is a fantastic company to work with if you're looking for DJ or lighting services for a wedding. My husband and I hired QPP to DJ/MC and ...

provide lighting for our wedding at the Brazilian Room in Berkeley this past May and they did an excellent job. The owner of the company, Jason, ended up DJ-ing our wedding himself and he was so well organized leading up to and during the event, kept us on time, worked with our officiant to determine the best approach/use of mics and made sure our parents, best man, and M.O.H. knew exactly when to give their speeches and helped with transition. A couple weeks before the wedding, Jason scheduled a call with me to run through our playlists (shared via Spotify) and make sure he knew every special song we wanted played (ceremony / first dance / parents dance / etc.) I would HIGHLY recommend QPP for any wedding - they rock!

ich I REALLY appreciated. I personally did not give Jason any songs outside of my first dance songs to play. Just letting Jason read the crowd and play music to the type of people on the dance floor, made the night. He DJ’d for almost 6 hours and everyone was on the dance floor the WHOLE time (so sweaty and way too much fun). I would definitely refer him to any friends family, or strangers. He was professional, kind, fun, and great to have at your party. A DJ that can read a crowd like that, is so so so important. I had MANY referrals to Jason and his crew and so glad they pointed me his way.

They knew the location of the venue, were on time, and set up nicely! Staff was great! They had a huge variety of props and I loved the gold sequin for the backdrop (which you can choose form the colors they have). I even loved the follow up email post wedding! Thanks for making this Photo Booth experience a great one! I would use them again for sure!! -Cory and Tony

ittle windy his lapel mic worked great and he was prepared for that unforeseeable possibility. He is quick to reply to emails and will call you to finalize what you would like him to say for introductions of family and bridal party, etc. He accommodated all our music requests and made executive decisions on the fly during the reception. I previewed his demos on soundcloud and I knew he was the right one for our party. I did not have to give him any specific songs, I trusted him to do his thing and he killed it. I just asked for EDM/hip hop and that’s all he blasted all night. I am not a fan of just playing the song, I think there should be some mixing to make people want to get up and dance and that’s what Jason did. Super nice guy, super easy to work with and I would not hesitate to recommend him for any event.

them a 4/5. Our DJ was DJ John/Jon (not sure how he spelled his name) and he was very skilled and familiar with our venue. He loved our playlist and could read the audience to change up pace where needed. He mixed up two songs during the ceremony, but it was at the very beginning and he quickly corrected it, so no harm was done. And overall, he did a great job with the music. And Jason, the man I worked with to coordinate everything, was short in his responses and kept brushing off my questions to say that he would coordinate details a week prior to our wedding, which made me very nervous. I had to contact him 5 days prior to ask about details and I didn't know who was showing up until I spoke to him during the reception. Jason wasn't necessarily rude, but just wasn't ready to have a lengthy conversation or e-mail conversations back and forth to make me feel comfortable. So that irritated me, but again, the DJ was great and everything went smoothly, so I'm giving them a 4/5.

We had an excellent experience working with Jason at Quantum Party Productions! We were referred to Jason's company and reached out to him, to which he promptly responded back. Jas...

on provided us with a personal touch, taking the time to get to know us in person and handling all of our questions and requests himself. We went thoroughly over the logistics of our wedding, and walked us through what types of services his company offered, and even giving us a demonstration of the dj equipment. By the end of the meeting, we were very comfortable and so decided to go with his company. We cannot say enough of how Jason was so personable, professional and accommodating. He even provided us with samples of musics, along with a list of different songs and artists across various genres of music to help us choose the right songs for each event. We greatly appreciated him providing his recommendations as well and his validation of our song choices in that they would work within each of our events. With 3 days to the wedding, we ended up having to change the ceremony from outdoors to indoors, and Jason was once again very flexible and accommodating and very promptly responded back to us which is exactly what you want when you're trying to deal with big last minute changes 3 days before the wedding. It's not just dj service that his company provides; they are like a one-stop shop, and were able to provide us with lighting, dance floor and chair rentals. It made it super convenient to get all this through one company versus working with multiple vendors. Jason went above and beyond by drawing up diagrams on how to our outdoor reception lighting would look like over the guest tables, etc. On top of all that, Jason coordinated with the our venue himself, relieving us of the stresses of being the middleman. He confidently assured us that he could handle it and ended up being true to his word. He was there personally to make sure his crew set up to our vision and checked in on us towards the end of the night to make sure all was going well. We cannot thank him enough and highly recommend him for your big day.

We used Quantum Party Productions (Jason) for our wedding at the SF Ritz Carlton and were SO HAPPY with the result. They crushed it. The executive summary is: super easy to work ...

with, great ideas for the flow of the wedding, amazing photobooth, and did an amazing job keeping the trains running on time through the reception. First, we met Jason at his office in Fidi, which was very convenient. He had a binder that made many of our reception choices easy. Being certified wedding planners, he also had many ideas for how to sequence out the reception, suggestions for the various dances, etc. He made us feel very confident that the reception would go off without a hitch. Our photobooth vendor completely flaked a week before the wedding (something that is a serious problem with small vendors of weddings). Luckily, Jason was right there. The photobooth props were the best I've ever seen at a wedding and the photobooth attendant was simply incredible. He was so helpful in suggesting props, getting people fired up, and keeping everything moving. I don’t think I've ever been to a wedding where the photobooth guy didn't mail it in, but the attendant Jason had was amazing. Finally, Jason on the wedding day was awesome. Without giving him individual song recommendations, he played music that had all our guests (including the older people) up and dancing literally all night. He was also amazing at keeping our timeline moving, reminding us to cut the cake, coordinating the light levels in the room. He truly owned his responsibility of making sure the reception was a success.

You know it's a great party when the guests keep asking for "just one more song" after he already played 4 "last songs" and the lights are already on. Not only that but you can't beat the price! Book him now before he realizes he's undercharging for how great he is ;) Also, he is extremely easy to work with which is important to all brides planning a wedding.

Our dance floor was packed from the first song until the last and we received so many compliments on the music! Jason was really able to understand the vibe we were going for and incorporate a variety of songs for a variety of generations. He was also very accommodating. When I asked for a very specific YouTube cover song for my walk down the aisle he didn’t bat an eye and made it happen. We had so much fun at our wedding and I can honestly say much of that was due to the tone Jason set. We are so happy with our choice to work with QMEP and Jason and would recommend them for any party, wedding, or event!

o hear (and nothing we didn't). Dustin and Reed were great on the photobooth, and since we had so many people wanting to take photos we ran out of paper, so they offered to take everything back to their office, finish the scrapbook, and send it to us. We did have one glitch two weeks before the wedding where we couldn't seem to get a hold of Jason, which was disconcerting, but other than that one occurrence Jason was great to work with. These guys really know what they're doing. And the value is unbeatable!

We used QMEP for DJ/MC and lighting. We found them on The Knot and contacted them via email. They responded immediately and were very helpful with our questions/concerns. We met wi...

th Jason at his showroom and he gave us a demonstration of his DJ skills and went over the ceremony with us. He was very friendly and enthusiastic and we felt comfortable right away. After we initially signed him as the DJ, we added string lighting to our package. It was a great value compared to other DJ and lighting services that we had seen. Jason and his staff arrived early to set up the DJ booth and lighting. Everything looked great. Jason was a fantastic MC, and helped keep everything on track and moving smoothly. He helped us by giving us some direction and encouragement, which we needed since this was our first wedding! All of the cues for the ceremony and the reception were on point. It was beautiful. During the dancing portion, he had everyone on their feet. He read the crowd perfectly and kept everything upbeat and exciting. Overall, we were so happy with everything. Jason and his staff are very professional and clearly know what they are doing. We will definitely recommend QMEP to anyone looking for wedding event planning services/DJ.

I worked with Quantum Music Events to DJ my wedding in May 2014 at the Crooked Vine Winery in Livermore, Ca. I didn’t get a chance to see their showroom because I live out of state...

, but I was able to contact Jason Shires easily through email whenever I had a question. Our DJ was John Harris and he was spot on. The dance floor was never empty. He even managed to find a version of my parents song “Sea of Love” performed by Robert Plant, which can’t be downloaded—you have to have the album. The actual ceremony was also flawless with the music seamlessly changing from the wedding party’s song to my song for walking down the aisle. Jason Shires was also present to set up the projector equipment for the slideshow, which was a hit! Everyone loved it and it was worth the money/time to put it together. QME is a very professional team, they are quick to respond and perform admirably. Everything was perfect!

Our wedding reception had the perfect soundtrack thanks to Jason and QMEP. From day one, even without ever meeting with him in person, we were able to scan through a very organized...

booklet of songs in their catalog, as well as request songs he may not have had available. We got a lot of comments from our guests about how much they loved the music. He was very respectful of our wishes not to make our reception turn into a "club" and every song that was chosen was well-received. He also provided some can lights for our photo booth. We couldn't be happier with Jason's services that day and would highly recommend him to anyone else looking for the perfect DJ!!

Jason got the party started and personalized it for me! We had a great time dancing it up...old and young.

We worked with Jason specifically and he was very reasonable and helpful. He was really friendly and it helped we had similar music interests. He played all our songs we really wan...

ted and in the order or specific time we wanted them to play. He is reliable and was fun to work with. The only change would have been to reduce the volume during the dance portion of the wedding since we were a very small wedding and at times difficult to chat with guests but the music was pumping and everyone was having a great time! Thank you!

I cannot recommend Jason Shires and QMEP highly enough. He did an absolutely stupendous job at our wedding reception. He nailed the musical vibe that we were looking for throughout...

the various parts of the reception: cocktail hour, dinner, and dancing. And he did so with minimal instruction; he just knew exactly what to do! He also was perfect as the emcee and knew exactly how to speak and when to speak. He read the crowd like an expert, graciously took requests from our guests, and even adjusted on the fly to unscheduled toasts and impromptu singing from some of the guests in attendance. Jason was a breeze to work with before, during, and after the reception. I offer him and QMEP my highest recommendation.

We recently got married and used QMEP as our DJ. We worked with Jason S to coordinate and plan for the day of and used Jason W as the actual DJ. They were both amazing! Jason S is ...

organized and very experienced in this area. He gave us great ideas and recommendations. On the day of, Jason W threw a huge dance party, which is what we wanted. Everyone had a blast and we got numerous compliments about the music. I would definitely recommend QMEP.

We chose Quantum because they were the coordinators for my wedding at Ardenwood. When looking at their website, it appeared that there were several DJ's in their company, however ...

the person that was our DJ, was not on their website, but the wife of our photography and the owner of Quantum. Sadly, her song choices were not great and the mixing was awkward. Once Jason took over, things got a lot better. I would recommend them, but only if you get a professional DJ the entire time. Their prices were comparable.

eamless. I had a couple guests ask for his contact information after the event and even had a party planner tell me he was the best she's seen. He is polite, helpful, and great at what he does. The photobooth and props were a big hit too, and wonderful keepsakes for both us and our guests. Thank you Jason!!
