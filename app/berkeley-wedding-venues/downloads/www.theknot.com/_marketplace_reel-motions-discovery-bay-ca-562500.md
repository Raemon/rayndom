We are beyond thrilled with the wedding videography provided by Reel Motions. From start to finish, his professionalism and communication were impeccable. He was a joy to be around...

on our wedding day, adding to the overall fun and excitement of the occasion. The final product exceeded our expectations in every way. Not only did we receive a beautifully crafted movie of our day, but he also provided us with a social media reel and several short videos capturing each key moment. His editing skills are truly exceptional—better than we could have ever imagined. He listened carefully to our preferences and seamlessly incorporated them into each video, making sure every detail we wanted was included. We are incredibly grateful for these amazing memories and highly recommend Reel Motions to anyone looking to capture their special day in the most memorable way possible.

Amazing! One of the best wedding decisions we made was hiring Reel Motions. EJ and Thomas were so down to earth and friendly that it made us feel like we were hanging out with frie...

nds on our wedding day. They collaborated so well with our photographer and even took some pictures on their phones the day of. EJ sent them to me and I was so surprised at how sweet that was and how wonderful the iPhone pictures were. EJ and Thomas made sure to capture the entire day and to get key elements that were most important to us. We truly enjoyed spending time with them! They made us feel comfortable and were great at directing us as well as being able to hide in the background when needed. Both of them showed us throughout the process that they cared and wanted to make us happy. When we received the highlight video, we were blown away! My husband was apprehensive about hiring a videographer but I convinced him to do it as I really wanted to have those memories. After watching the highlight video, he was so happy we hired Reel Motions. They picked one of the songs we liked and it flowed perfectly with the video. They captured everything we wanted and more! I’ve watched it so many times and each time I love it more. Everyone we’ve shown it to is amazed at how beautiful it came out and how professional it looks. The video quality is top notch as well as the editing. I’m grateful for them taking the time to make this special for us. They even scheduled a call with us while they were working on it to confirm a few details. Later on we received the footage from the day which included another four videos (getting ready, wedding ceremony, speeches, and friends and family). Not only did they put two of the videos to music but they also made them into edited videos that are fun to watch. They captured moments that I didn’t even remember and/or didn’t notice that they were recording. The ceremony music sounded great and the mics they put on my husband and our officiant blended in pretty well and captured the voices well. We 100% recommend Reel Motions to anyone who wants a videographer to capture special memories. We would use them again in a heartbeat! On top of all this, their prices are more than fair and I can’t imagine anyone being dissatisfied with them! EJ and Thomas are top notch all around!

EJ & Thomas were such a pleasure to work with for our wedding in Napa Valley! My husband and I had to change our wedding plans so many times due to Covid and EJ and his team (Cecy ...

included) were flexible and accommodating. Our wedding day went by so fast, it was hard to remember all the little details from memory but after seeing that EJ & Thomas actually got footage of all those little moments, we were able to live them again like it was yesterday! The way the video was shot and edited was super fun to watch, everyone we showed the video to loved it and agreed EJ did a fantastic job. Hire EJ as your videographer and you’ll see it will be one of the best investments you will make on your wedding day because his video perfectly preserves that moment in time just how you remember it! Thanks EJ & Team!

Our special day would not have been complete without EJ and Team with ReelMotion. My photographer recommended EJs services and I thank my lucky stars she did. Wedding Videos can be...

a budget breaker- but I must say, it’s a nessesiyu. A wedding days feels like minutes- and many moments missed. It was by far the best decision I made during wedding planning. I knew just after seeing my highlight reel that the wedding video would be perfect. It was more than that. EJ and Team were professional and beyond creative with their services- from drones above the ceremony, to fun video effects with my bridal party- my wedding video will be shared for a lifetime. Thank you EJ!

STOP YOUR SEARCH FOR YOUR VIDEOGRAPHER - THIS IS YOUR GUY! We honestly don’t even know where to start in this review other than that you probably will never meet someone as kind a...

nd professional as EJ. We first contacted him about shooting our Yosemite wedding about a year before the big day. We had heard about him as he had shot one of my husband’s friend’s wedding. As soon as he responded, we knew that he was the videographer for us and that we could stop our search. What really attracted us to EJ was his extensive experience with nature photography (check out his IG account @nikonej). Since we were getting married in Yosemite National Park, this was a huge plus for us. He knows and loves Yosemite and is passionate about capturing such outdoor footage. We Skyped with EJ initially and he was extremely kind and accommodating to answer all of our questions about videographer, logistics and more. EJ is so professional and knowledgeable when it comes to weddings and his personability cannot be beat. We kept in contact with him throughout the whole lead up to the wedding, exchanging thoughts and ideas and asking him many more questions. When we finally met EJ, we felt like we were meeting an old friend. Him and his assistant, Thomas, were so wonderful to work with. Their experience and creativity really shone through as we spent the day hiking through forests and up mountains together in Yosemite. They came up with so many creative ideas for amazing footage that we never would have thought of. Even before we left our chalet to start the day, they got so many awesome detail shots of our outfits, rings and of us getting ready. We truly cannot imagine a videographer with more dedication to his field than EJ. He drove up to Yosemite, of his own accord, a few weeks before our wedding to capture additional nature footage for our wedding video, and even went all the way up to Glacier Point to capture sunrise the day before our wedding, again just to get extra footage for us. This initiative and drive say a lot about EJ’s professionalism and passion for his line of work, and we can’t thank him enough for truly going above and beyond to give us the best wedding video we ever could have imagined. We received our finalised highlight video from EJ just a few weeks after the wedding which was a really pleasant surprise. To say we were blown away would not do this video justice! The reactions we’ve had from friends and family second that and bear testament to EJ’s hard work. Everything we witnessed in the year before our wedding, from EJ’s drive, dedication and creativity has been realised in unbelievable footage of our wedding day that we get to watch over and over again. EJ has managed to find the perfect mix between gorgeous landscapes and nature footage, and footage of precious moments between my husband and I on our wedding day. His editing skills are second to none and we are amazed at what he did with the footage after our wedding! Hiring EJ was one of the best decisions we made during our whole wedding planning process and we can’t imagine having chosen anyone else. Not only that, but we honestly feel like we have made friends for life in EJ and Thomas. Since there were only my husband and I at our wedding (no friends/family/guests!), it was extremely important to us that we get great footage of our wedding to show our loved ones afterwards. Thank you for memorialising our big day in the best way we ever could have imagined!

Best. Decision. Ever!!! We had contacted a few other videographers but none where like EJ. From the moment we contacted EJ he was professional, responded to our emails quickly, and made the whole experience great for us! After our first face to face meeting we knew that we would absolutely hire him for our wedding! He is a very nice, friendly, and genuine person and we definitely knew we wanted him to be part of our special day! On the day of our wedding, EJ was professional and great to work with! Everyone was very comfortable around him and said nothing but nice things about him! He also worked exceptionally well with our photographers! I just received my wedding highlight video and....I cried!!! It was SO BEAUTIFUL! The music, the edits, the flow of the video was perfect! We absolutely LOVED our video! EJ did an AMAZING job! We are so happy that we decided to book a videographer, and glad we went with EJ from Reel-Motions! :)

When I began planning our wedding, I knew that the two most important vendors for me would be our photographer and our videographer. We would be trusting these people to capture on...

e of the most important days of our lives. I could not have made a better choice for our videographer than EJ from Reel-Motions! From the very beginning, EJ was easy to work with, polite, and always listened to our requests about what we wanted for our video. He promptly responded to our emails and was very pleasant to work with. Several things went wrong with our wedding plan along the way, but I never doubted that EJ would do an amazing job and I never had to worry about this one aspect of our wedding. We just recently received our highlight video and it totally captures some very real moments and the true feelings of our big day. It is so fun watching it over and over and getting to see parts of our wedding that we didn't get to witness ourselves as there is so much going on that day. It is something my husband and I will always have to treasure and have to look back on and remember the details of our wedding day. We cannot wait to receive the footage of the whole day! I couldn't sing higher praises for EJ! My brother recently got engaged and if he chooses to have a videographer (which I HIGHLY recommend!), EJ will certainly get my vote!

We hired EJ with Reel Motions to cover our wedding video and he did a spectacular job!! We had so many things go wrong that day but looking at our video and from our guests perspec...

tive everything looked perfect and beautiful!! He was easygoing, funny, calm, prompt, and super mellow in the midst of the chaos. At times we barely even knew he was there! And our footage was a-MA-zing! We got our highlight video in just a few short weeks and even before that he sent us a 'sneak peak' to tide us over!! Completely unexpected and appreciated! We gave 5 stars because he truly exceeded our expectations, we're glad that we chose to have our special day documented with video and even more satisfied that we had it done by EJ and team. The day went by SO unrealistically fast, that without EJ we would have had to rely on just photographs and guests stories to try to recapture the magic of the day as it unfolded, but his video does just that. We're still awaiting our full coverage video but have no doubts that it'll be just as great if not better. EVERYONE wants a copy! You won't be disappointed or regret it if you go with Reel Motions, we'd definitely use them again!! Thanks for everything!! Veronica & Ryan

FANTASTIC!!! The moment we spoke to EJ on the phone we knew he was our videographer! He was so warm, open, VERY EASY GOING and really listened to what we wanted for our wedding. Hi...

s responsiveness was outstanding before and after the wedding. We never had a doubt that he wouldn't deliver. We told EJ from the very beginning how camera shy we were. Well aside from him saying hi at the beginning of the day, we didn't even notice he and his assistant were there! :-) Everything we asked for he captured for us! AMAZING! The wedding highlight video was delivered quickly and made all of my family and friends cry because it captured the day so perfectly! He sent us the full length cd's in a nice display box on time. There were a few things we wanted to add/change and EJ responded quickly! He sent us the revised full length and we couldn't be happier!!! So happy with the end result. Suggestion - Make sure you ask about using the drone at your wedding! So beautiful capturing the entire wedding setting from the sky!! Bottom line: I did a lot of research and you can't find anyone better than EJ. He should be charging more than what he charges :-) (which is so, so reasonable compared to many others). You will not be disappointed. We got married at Greystone/CIA in St. Helena and they added him to their preferred vendor list because he is so great! Don't think twice about hiring EJ!! Just do it! :-) Thank you EJ for capturing our special day (April 2, 2016)!

to the wedding and were so very thankful. The highlight video is amazing and my husband and I watch it frequently. They edited the music to go with it perfectly. Everyone we show it to swears we should submit it to be a music video. We also love the whole footage of the wedding. Watching the whole ceremony and the vows over again is a wonderful treat! I highly recommend EJ and the Reel Motions crew, you won't be disappointed.
