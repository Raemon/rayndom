We are over the moon with how fantastic our wedding catering was. Chef Matt, Nina & the entire Epicurean Escape team were fantastic from start to finish. During the planning proc...

ess, Nina & Chef Matt helped us narrow down a menu that included the variety we were looking for while also feeling very cohesive (we had a hard time choosing given all the incredible options they have available). They helped us schedule a last minute tasting during a trip up to Santa Rosa, which was incredibly kind of them. The tasting was intimate and inviting, and they let us take lots of notes and were very responsive to feedback (example: switching goat cheese to feta since my partner has a hard time with goat cheese). I’ll admit I reached out with a lot of questions and a few additions to our quote, and Nina was incredibly generous with her time, responding to my emails quickly and with all the information I needed to keep moving forward with wedding planning. On the day of the event, the entire team was incredibly professional and again, so organized. They even prepared a duo plate with 2 of every appetizer for my husband & I so we got the chance to actually enjoy all the hors d’oeuvres we’d picked out. At dinner, the dishes all looked beautiful, and tasted even better. My adrenaline kept me from eating a lot of my dinner on the day, but no fear, Epicurean packaged plates up for both my husband and I so that the next day we were able to enjoy wedding dinner part 2. And the leftovers tasted incredible! I highly recommend choosing Epicurean Escape as your wedding catering team. Producing such high quality food for over 100 people all at the same time is a feat. Their flavors are phenomenal, their crew is responsive, helpful, and incredibly knowledgeable. And I can’t forget to mention that they also care about sourcing locally, which was important to us and made the food taste even more amazing. Thank you Chef Matt, Nina & everyone who helped make our wedding so special!

Chef Matt and his team are absolutely unbeatable!! If you're looking for someone who is able to execute something a bit out of the norm, or even the normalist of things 😂, you wil...

l not find anyone better than Epicurean Escape Catering. My husband and I were set on having pupusas for our wedding, and it was a surprisingly difficult thing to accomplish. From all of our efforts and research, pupuserias don't really do wedding catering, and wedding caterers don't really do pupusas, but Chef Matt pulled it off for us on a whole nother level of excellence! When we originally reached out to him, he just said that they could do it, and we were ecstatic. At our first tasting, he had already gone to his local pupusa spot to analyze the timing, and watch the whole process. He hadn't done pupusas before, but had the drive, determination, and confidence to pull it off for us. When our wedding day came, we along with every one of our guests were absolutely blown away by the quality of every bit of food and drinks that they provided us all with. 🥰 He was able to find the wife of a Salvadoran friend, and her mother, to help him make them all fresh on our wedding day, on a plancha that they were able to bring. The vibe was incredible, the food was impeccable, and even the Salvadorans attending were incredibly impressed. From the yucca fries to the plantain chips, from the guacamole to the curtido, from the coffee to the agua frescas, from the salsas to the amazing service, from the compostable serving ware to the incredible bartender. People still can't stop raving. The pupusas, the dips, the black chili salsa, the coffee, just everything. Kharma worked with us relentlessly over every tiny detail to get all of it right, and everything came together SO beautifully, and went SO smoothly without even the smallest hitch. Chef Matt and the Epicurean Escape Catering team literally made our dreams come true. We cannot recommend them enough!!!

We hired EEC for our recent wedding in June and were blown away by the quality of the meal they prepared, as well as their professionalism and experience they provided! The whole t...

eam was friendly and extremely easy to work with. Chef Matt and Nina drove out to the venue in Cloverdale a week prior to the event to ensure they understood what my husband and I were looking for, as well as sort out the details so there were no surprises the day of. My husband and I did not hire a wedding coordinator, and found the knowledge EEC was able to provide was so helpful in the planning process, and feel they played a huge part in our wedding running so smoothly. The food was amazing! We heard from multiple of our guests, as well as our photographer who has been to many weddings, that the food EEC provided was some of the best they had had at a wedding. :) We HIGHLY recommend hiring Chef Matt and his team for your next event.

Chef Matt and Daisy are two kind souls who’ve created a uniquely wonderful catering service with the absolute best food imaginable! They were both amazing to work with throughout t...

he wedding planning process and perfectly executed our family style meal. Chef Matt’s food is elevated, creative, and thoughtful while Daisy and her friendly staff’s service skills are polished and well prepared. Every aspect was exceptional, and all of our guests continue to talk about the delicious food and drinks at our wedding. The Epicurean Team also prepared and delivered our amazing brunch service the day after the wedding, which I highly recommend! Their prices are unparalleled and Chef Matt will work with you to create a fun and distinctive menu that showcases sustainable, local, and seasonal ingredients. I strongly recommend hiring them for all your event needs, and I’m dreaming of the next time I get to taste Chef Matt’s incredible food!

They did a nice quiet job of cleaning the tables and placing the food but the food was garlic bread burnt, the lasagna was soggy, overcooked and tasteless and the polenta was like ...

soup, no one could eat it. I would not reccomend this place for your catering even though the sampling was delicious. it did not reflect in what we recieved at our wedding. It was the only bad part of our whole event at least

Wow, just wow!! We stumbled upon Epicurean Escape Catering while planning our wedding, they had worked at our venue once before. As soon as we sat down for a tasting we knew we had...

to go with them. The head chef Matt is a genius! His creations are absolutely to die for and his helpful and kind nature instantly won us over. The rest of the team was attentive and responsive throughout the entire planning process. They went above and beyond and helped us when the unexpected came up. Our wedding wouldn’t have been half as enjoyable if not for Epicurean Escape!
