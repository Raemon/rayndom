Kendel Shapses

Manager

Green Acres is a family owned and operated horse ranch. Our family has lived on the coast for over 35 years and we have always dreamed of a peaceful place for us to live with our horses. In 2008, my parents bought this majestic, wild property. As a family, we worked tirelessly for years to turn this dream into reality. This ranch is our dream and it is our greatest pleasure to be able to share its beauty with couples looking to get married. As the Ranch Manager, my goal is to help make your special day as perfect as possible.

Green Acres Ranch & Wedding Venue in Montara is pure magic, and I cannot say enough amazing things about both the property and its incredible owner, Sylver. From the moment we firs...

t visited the ranch, Sylver’s warmth, professionalism, and genuine passion for what she does were undeniable. She has an exceptional eye for detail—things I never would’ve thought of, she had planned out in advance. Every question was answered quickly, every concern put at ease, and every step of the process felt smooth and stress-free because of her. The venue itself is breathtaking. The ranch-style setting is the perfect blend of coastal charm and rustic elegance. The open spaces, natural beauty, and peaceful atmosphere create a backdrop that feels cinematic. Every corner of the property is thoughtfully maintained, and it truly feels like a private oasis. What stood out the most, though, was Sylver’s care and attentiveness. She goes above and beyond—guiding you through planning, offering helpful suggestions, and making sure the entire experience feels effortless. Her communication is always clear, prompt, and kind. You feel supported the entire way, and on the wedding day, you can tell she takes genuine pride in making everything perfect. Our wedding at Green Acres Ranch was unforgettable. Guests couldn’t stop talking about how stunning the venue was and how smoothly everything ran. If you’re looking for a place that’s beautiful, welcoming, and run by someone who truly cares, look no further. Thank you, Sylver, for giving us the wedding of our dreams. Green Acres Ranch isn’t just a venue—it’s an experience we’ll cherish forever.

eption areas were spacious and inviting. I was worried that I would be cold in a dress when the sun went down, but I was surprised to find that once we were dancing there was no need for any layers at all! If you are looking for a country-themed wedding surrounded by nature, this is the place for you!

Green Acres Ranch and Wedding Venue proved to be the perfect space for a wedding I recently attended. While centrally located between Half Moon Bay and Pacifica, the ranch is off a...

private road and is not visible from Highway 1. The venue was easy to get to, but provided an intimate setting for the big day. The ranch is well kept and the natural landscapes provided great backdrops for photos! The family that runs the venue were very easy to work with. Would highly recommend others to take a look!
