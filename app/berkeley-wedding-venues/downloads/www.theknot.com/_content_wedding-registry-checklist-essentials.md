Start your registry list for your wedding in the heart of your home. Having [the right cookware](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-registry-pots-pans-101), tools and small appliances will help motivate you to make homemade meals (and desserts) with your partner.

What's a home-cooked meal without a nice table setting? From breakfast, lunch and dinner with your spouse to hosting holidays and parties for your friends and family, these wedding registry checklist ideas for serveware are all you need. Plus, we list quantities! 

The general rule of thumb is to have 8 to 12 place settings—matching that quantity for flatware, drinkware and table linens. Of course, you can account for what you already own as a couple and assess your anticipated hosting needs to determine your final number. If you won't be in charge of Thanksgiving dinner, there's no need to stock your cabinets with a dozen charger plates. 

  * 5-piece flatware sets (6 to 12)
  * Beer glasses
  * Butter dish and knife
  * Cake stand
  * Cereal or soup bowls (6 to 12)
  * Champagne flutes
  * Charcuterie board and cheese knives
  * Coasters
  * Coffee or tea mugs (6 to 8)
  * Creamer and sugar bowl set
  * Decanter
  * Dinner plates (6 to 12)
  * Espresso cups and saucers
  * Gravy boat
  * Highball glasses
  * Ice bucket with tongs
  * Juice and water glasses (12)
  * Napkins and rings
  * Pitcher or carafe
  * Placemats
  * Red and white wine glasses
  * Rocks glasses
  * Salad bowl
  * Salad or dessert plates (6 to 12)
  * Salt and pepper shakers
  * Serving bowls and platters
  * Serving utensils
  * Soup tureen
  * Specialty cocktail glassware
  * Tablecloths
  * Trivets
  * Wine chiller

_[Photo: The Knot Registry Store](https://www.theknot.com/registry/store/products/signature-hemmed-organic-cotton-sheet-set-1?id=226481)_

Your bedroom should be a cozy oasis for you and your spouse. Even if you already live together, bedroom registry items are still necessary. After all, this is an opportunity to register for that silky, thermoregulating sheet set you've been eyeing online and fluffy new pillows that'll help with your postwedding R&R. Plus, you'll want to think about guest rooms if you have them. It's said you should have two to three sheet sets per bed so that you'll always have fresh ones to use. First things first: Check your linen closet. Could you use more pillowcases? Do you want both a comforter _and_ a quilt so you can swap your bedding with the seasons? This is your time to ask for anything that'll elevate the bedroom(s) and aid in better sleep. Just make sure to specify each linen's color or print so everything will match.

_[Photo: The Knot Registry Store](https://www.theknot.com/registry/store/products/towel-warmer-with-lid-1?id=243433)_

For your pampering domain, you'll need so much more than just plush bath towels. (Though, new towel sets—specifically three per individual in the household—are a great start for any bathroom registry checklist.) Some other bathroom wedding registry essentials: a bath mat, a linen hamper and vanity organizers.

While [cash funds](https://www.theknot.com/content/cash-registry-ideas) are a great way to cover some big-ticket items like a giant sectional or flat screen, there are still plenty of home furnishings you should register for to decorate the rest of your newlywed nest.

_[Photo: The Knot Registry Store](https://www.theknot.com/registry/store/products/koda-12-gas-powered-pizza-oven?id=203949)_

Want your home to be the go-to destination for summer cookouts and late-night porch chats? Use your bridal registry list to turn your outdoor space into a nature retreat that's perfect for entertaining. Whether you have acres of land or you're working with a small balcony, registering intentionally will help you transform your space. (This means you'll need to know the area's measurements and HOA restrictions before adding patio furniture and a fire pit to your wedding registry.) If you have the essentials covered, consider asking for fun lawn games, a waterproof speaker or a pizza oven (a must-have for a wedding registry, in our opinion) to take it to the next level. What can you add from this outdoor registry checklist for your wedding?

  * Decorative lighting
  * Firepit
  * Garden tools
  * Grill and barbecue tools
  * Lawn games
  * Lounge chairs or chaises
  * Outdoor planters
  * Outdoor rug
  * Outdoor speaker

## **Wedding Registry Checklist FAQ**

Now that you have a solid list of wedding registry items, check out the answers to the frequently asked questions below for more details on adding gifts.

### **How many gifts should be on a registry?**

When it comes to [how many gifts to put on your registry](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-many-gifts-to-register-for), you'll want to multiply your guest list by two and then add a few extras. This gives friends and family plenty of options, so they can all find something that excites them and that fits nicely within their budget.

### **Do we need to include every item from the checklist?**

Our must-have wedding registry checklist is ultimately a jumping-off point. While we've included all the important wedding registry essentials, every couple is different. Take stock of what you have, what you need and what you want before adding items to your wish list. And just because something is a traditional wedding gift doesn't mean it's the right wedding gift for you. No matter what you decide to register for, enjoy the process—making your registry should be a fun task for both of you in the months leading up to the wedding.

### **What do we add to the registry if we already have most items?**

If you've already got most of the household and lifestyle items, some unique wedding registry must-haves may include cash funds, [charity donations](https://www.theknot.com/content/charitable-donations-instead-of-wedding-gifts) and [gift cards](https://www.theknot.com/content/gift-cards-wedding-registry), as well as travel essentials for your honeymoon and treats for your furry BFF. Your registry should feel tailored to your relationship and lifestyle, so if you have a small space or you just don't need more things, it's A-OK to get creative. After all, your friends and family want to get you things you'll actually use.
