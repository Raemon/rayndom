## Three (or More) Months Before

If you're wondering how to plan a bridal shower, here's exactly where to start. While three months doesn't seem like a ton of time, it's absolutely possible to put together an amazing shower—if you follow these simple steps.

### 1\. Choose a Host

Traditionally, the [maid of honor](https://www.theknot.com/content/maid-of-honor-duties-in-detail) spearheads the bridal shower planning process, with support from the rest of the bridal party. But these days, the privilege of [hosting a bridal shower](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-shower-host-etiquette) can fall to a variety of loved ones, from family members (including the mother of the bride or the mother of the bride's soon-to-be spouse), to family friends and more. Make sure you've nailed down who's hosting before you start to plan the event. And this goes without saying, but make sure the bride or couple _actually_ wants a shower before you select a host.

### 2\. Consult the Couple

While the host (perhaps you) may be the one planning the bridal shower, you should consult the bride and/or couple to nail down some of the details. Are there particular dates or times that won't work? Do they prefer a big or small shower? Is there a particular bridal shower theme they have in mind? While most of the bridal shower to-do list will be up to you, plan according to this input.

### 3\. Pick a Theme

Choosing the right [bridal shower theme](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-shower-themes) will set the tone for the party, from the decorations, to the favors, to the refreshments and more. The guest of honor may have some thoughts on the shower theme, or you can choose one based on their interests or hobbies. Also decide if the theme will affect gift giving (for example, a lingerie shower means that all guests should purchase lingerie for the bride). Note that a shower doesn't have to have a theme, but you may want to choose an activity or other central focus that will help inform the party planning process.

### 4\. Set a Date

This is probably the trickiest task on the bridal shower planning checklist—finding a date that works for the bride, the wedding party and close family and friends. Typically, the shower takes place two or three months before the wedding, but can be closer to the wedding if that's the only time that will work. You'll also want to decide if the bridal shower and bachelorette party will take place during the same weekend or be spaced out. Talk to the guest of honor about any scheduling conflicts and confirm potential dates with other VIPs.

### 5\. Create a Budget

Between food, decor, favors and other details, bridal shower expenses can add up. Work with any cohosts to come up with a total budget you can refer to throughout the planning process so you won't overspend.

### 6\. Set the Guest List

[Who do you invite to a bridal shower](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-shower-invite-etiquette)? A bridal shower guest list typically includes members of the wedding party, close family and close friends, depending on the desired size of the event (this choice will also inform your venue selection). By the way, if the bride has a The Knot account, collab with them to use the free guest list tool to create a separate guest list for the bridal shower (you can even track RSVPs). And lastly, remember this one etiquette rule: Bridal shower guests must also be invited to the wedding.

[Start Your Guest List](https://www.theknot.com/our-guest-list/)

### 7\. Choose and Book a Venue

Bridal showers often are hosted at a loved one's home, but restaurants, bars, country clubs, event spaces, spas and more can also make great [bridal shower venues](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-shower-venues). Check out [The Knot Vendor Marketplace](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace) to find bridal shower venues in your area that fit your event's size and budget, tour your favorites and put down a deposit to reserve your chosen space. Just set the filters to your preferences.

### 8\. Hire Any Vendors

If you're hiring pros—like a bridal shower planner, photographer, florist, caterer, rentals company or cake baker—to help out with the event, now's the time to research and book them. A florist and a caterer will definitely come in handy if you can swing the cost. And if you really need a point person for planning, you can also hire a bridal shower planner from [The Knot Vendor Marketplace](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/wedding-planners). Simply head to the wedding planner section and click the "Rehearsals & parties" filter. 

[Browse Nearby Vendors](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace)

### 9\. Ensure the Couple's Registry Is Up

Guests will look to a couple's wedding registry to purchase bridal shower gifts. Make sure the couple has set up their registry and has shared the information on their [wedding website](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-to-find-a-couples-wedding-web-page), so they'll receive their desired gifts.

## Two Months Before

Now that you've figured out the most important parts of bridal shower planning, it's time to finalize the details and invite your guests.

### 10\. Compile Guest Addresses

Whether you're sending out printed or online bridal shower invitations, it's important to gather guests' mailing or email addresses so you're not scrambling at the last minute. And along with tracking RSVPs and helping you stay organized, you can also use [The Knot Guest List Tool](https://www.theknot.com/our-guest-list/) to gather the mailing addresses of shower guests in a snap. 

### 11\. Select and Mail Invitations

We recommend giving guests as much advance notice as possible so they can plan to attend the shower—especially if many loved ones will need to travel. [Printed bridal shower invitations](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-shower-invitations) are the more traditional route (and who doesn't love receiving snail mail?), but [online invitations](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-shower-invitations-online) are growing in popularity too. Check out [The Knot Invitations](https://www.theknot.com/paper/invitations/bridal-shower) for affordable bridal shower invitation options. As you're creating shower invitations, don't forget to include information about the couple's [registries](https://www.theknot.com/registry). And, if it's a theme party, provide proper gift-giving instructions. RSVPs (via phone or email) should be due about two weeks before the celebration.

[Choose Bridal Shower Invitations](https://www.theknot.com/paper/invitations/bridal-shower)

### 12\. Finalize Decor Decisions

Schedule a brainstorming session with fellow hosts to finalize decisions about table linens, flowers, menus, [bridal shower decorations](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-shower-decorations) and the other visual elements of the day. Giving yourself ample time to sort out your vision will ensure you can get an accurate idea of what you'll need to add to your checklist for the wedding shower ahead of the event to pull off the look and feel you're going for.

### 13\. Delegate Tasks 

Once the above decisions are made, you'll also want to nail down who's responsible for obtaining or creating supplies, setting up, organizing games, recording gifts, making the ribbon bouquet, etc. Create a to-do list that outlines assigned tasks, so everyone knows what to do and when.

![Bridal shower picnic with pink decor](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/52ba7e7b-0b8a-4687-a252-4ef6614ec246~rs_768.h-cr_0.126.1080.1566)

## One Month Before

With a month to go, you'll want to start shopping for all the shower necessities and create a timeline to ensure your event runs smoothly.

### 14\. Shop for Decor and Party Props

Now that you've given some thought to your aesthetic vision, it's time to start purchasing all of your bridal shower necessities. As you gather decor, don't forget any party props you might need, like props for a photobooth station, if you have one. And if you're still a little fuzzy on the exact items you'll need to pull off your vision, consult our bridal shower decor guides.

### 15\. Purchase Favors

There are lots of sweet [bridal shower favors](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-shower-favors) out there. When in doubt choose something edible or drinkable, like a jar of local honey or a few sachets of high-quality tea. You also don't need to select favors as fancy as you might for the wedding itself. Also, now's a great time to shop around for [bridal shower game prizes](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-shower-game-prizes) as well.

### 16\. Confirm Your Vendors

As the bridal shower day nears, you'll want to reach out to any vendors you've hired to confirm details, timing and more. If you've hired a planner to help out, they can handle this task (and many others!) for you.

### 17\. Set the Bridal Shower Itinerary 

A bridal shower timeline is a must to ensure that everything is set up and everyone arrives on time. Your wedding shower timeline should get down to the tiny details, scheduling everything from arrivals to gift opening, games, food service, speeches and more, to make sure enough time is allotted for each activity. The sweet spot for [how a long a bridal shower should last](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-long-are-bridal-showers) is around three hours. The best way to assemble a bridal shower itinerary is to ensure that the first 30–45 minutes or so is set aside for mingling, getting drinks and light bites and allowing guests to filter in. Then, you can start the meal, followed by some [bridal shower games](https://www.theknot.com/content/a-complete-guide-to-bridal-shower-games) and gift opening while guests are comfortably seated at their tables or around the room (depending on the venue). And while it can be tempting, try to keep the activity level moderate, with no more than two organized games.

_[Photo: Alexa Lynn Photography](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/alexa-lynn-photography-freehold-nj-2043839)_

## Two (or More) Weeks Before

At the two-week mark of planning a wedding shower, it's all about the details—decorations, gifts, food, music and more. Plan to do a lot of double checking during this time.

### 18\. Buy Your Gift

Yes, even the hosts have to purchase a [bridal shower gift](https://www.theknot.com/content/classic-andcontemporary-bridal-shower-gift-ideas)! Keep it simple by grabbing something from the couple's wedding registry, or choose a meaningful gift that reflects your relationship with the bride.

### 19\. Gather Up Your Decorations

Those decorations and decor items you bought a few weeks ago? It's time to get them all in one place and take stock of your inventory. Did everything you ordered online come in? Are there any holes in your collection? Does everything go together? These are all questions you should consider as you get your checklist for the couple's shower organized. 

### 20\. Make a Shopping List for Food and Bev

If you're purchasing (or making) [bridal shower food](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-shower-food-ideas), now's the time to make a list of what you'll need. Don't forget about drinks too. Of course, hosting the shower at a restaurant or hiring a caterer means you can forgo this step. Also be sure to coordinate a sweet dessert for the guest of honor, like a [bridal shower cake](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-shower-cakes).

  * [What to Write on a Bridal Shower Cake](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-to-decorate-the-bridal-shower-cake)



### 21\. Purchase Any Spirits for Cocktails

If you're serving alcohol, buying your own spirits for [bridal shower drinks](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-shower-drinks) can be a big money-saver (if the venue allows it). Note that if liquor is being served at a venue that isn't a private home, a professional and licensed bartender will need to be on hand to pour the booze.

### 22\. Create a Shower Playlist

Music can really set the tone for your event, so creating a [bridal shower playlist](https://www.theknot.com/content/bridal-shower-songs) in advance is an important step on the bridal shower checklist. Upbeat songs that focus on romance are always a good way to go.

### 23\. Pick Up Any Important items

Whether you're using an heirloom cake topper or showcasing family photos, you'll want to make sure you have everything you need on hand for planning a bridal shower with enough time before the event date.

## One Week Before

Yes, all you've learned so far about how to plan a wedding shower will come in handy during the seven-days-away crunch period. There's a lot to do in the week before the shower. Don't be afraid to delegate responsibilities to other members of the wedding party, family or friends.

### 24\. Confirm RSVPs

Now's the time to follow up with any guests who haven't RSVP'd to confirm if they're attending the shower or not. It's also a nice idea to send an email or text (read: friendly reminder) to guests to let them know you're looking forward to seeing them at the event.

### 25\. Confirm Any and All Deliveries

In the week prior to the bridal shower, spend some time confirming details with the venue, vendors and anyone else who's contributing items or services to the event.

### 26\. Make a Mental Floorplan

Whether you're hosting the shower at an event space or someone's home, it's important to have an idea of how the room will be set up so you can plan and decorate accordingly. While assigned seating isn't the norm at bridal showers, if you're going that route, it's time to create your seating chart, make place cards, etc.

### 27\. Organize Your Activities

From the newlywed game, to couple's trivia, to the toilet paper wedding dress game, to count the candies, there are a lot of bridal shower games to choose from. Make sure you have all the necessary supplies to ensure these games go off without a hitch.

### 28\. Assemble the Favors

Set aside some time to DIY or assemble the bridal shower favors, if you're going that route. Enlist the help of other hosts if needed.

## One Day Before

It's the final countdown and time to tie up any loose ends on your wedding shower planning checklist. The goal here is to have as many elements as possible ready to go the night before the shower so you're not scrambling the morning of.

### Prepare Food

If you're responsible for preparing any menu items, you'll want to make sure that everything is prepped the day before the event.

### Assemble Your Bridal Shower Setup

When it comes to setting up for a bridal shower, the sooner the better! If you aren't able to start setting up until the day of the shower, do as much as you can at home, whether that's creating centerpieces, organizing game supplies or putting together the cupcake tower.

### Touch Base With Other Hosts

Your text chain with the other shower hosts is probably blowing up right about now—make sure everyone has a copy of the timeline and knows what time to arrive.

### Run Any Last-Minute Errands

Handling any to-dos the day or night before means less scrambling on the day of. Don't forget to bring items like scissors, garbage bags, paper plates (for the ribbon bouquet), paper and a pen. Make sure your car is all packed up and ready to go before going to bed the night before the shower.

## Day-of Bridal Shower Checklist

It's party time! Hopefully using our bridal shower planning checklist paid off and you're able to relax and enjoy the celebration.

  * Prep any food that needs to be made the same day.
  * Pick up cake or other desserts.
