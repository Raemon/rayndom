Colin Pattison

Owner, Lead Cinematographer

I believe in marriage, and I've always loved the culmination of two lives coming together. I got started in the wedding business after completing a Bachelors of Fine Arts. After a few years abroad in Japan, I completed a photography degree and then worked for world renowned wedding photographer Bambi Cantrell for three years before once again running my own business. I've been capturing the magic of weddings for over ten years. When I'm not shooting, I love spending time with my wife, three kids, and two big dogs. I also love traveling, trying new foods, and learning about different cultures.

nal. He truly listened to our vision and what we had in mind for our special day, while also offering insightful and helpful advice that we genuinely appreciated. He was always quick to respond to any questions we had, which made the entire planning process so reassuring. When our wedding day arrived, I was beyond happy to have Colin and his team with us. He knew exactly how to ease our nerves and was wonderful at making us smile and feel comfortable. Throughout the day, my husband and I were so grateful for all the help and support Colin and his team provided. They were 100% present, capturing every moment so beautifully and naturally. There truly was no better choice we could have made, and we will always be grateful to Colin and his team. When we received our videos, I was overcome with happy tears—our special day was captured so beautifully that it felt like we were reliving every moment all over again. Every emotion was perfectly preserved on film. We received countless compliments on our wedding videos, and we could not be more thankful. We will forever recommend Colin and his team. If you are searching for someone to capture your day with elegance and grace, look no further. Featherstone Wedding Films will deliver a timeless treasure of one of the most special days of your life.

h him. He was friendly, responsive, and easy to work with from the start. He answered all of our questions before we put down a deposit, and one of the most important factors for us was that he included access to the raw footage in addition to the edited videos. About 1 to 2 weeks before the wedding, we did a schedule walkthrough call to go over the latest timeline so everyone was aligned. On the wedding day, Colin and his second videographer were excellent, super professional, and worked seamlessly with our photographer and coordinator. Colin really went above and beyond when I had the idea to do guest interviews during cocktail hour. It was similar to a guestbook, but instead our guests left short video messages, which added so much more personality and life. Colin was genuinely excited about the idea and even bought a special microphone to make sure it could be done smoothly during cocktail hour. The editing was also excellent. Colin shared a great preview video within a few days, and a few months later sent the first draft of the highlights video. He was very receptive to feedback, and we worked together to make a highlight video my wife and I absolutely loved. We loved it so much that we decided to add on a documentary-style video to capture as many details from the day as possible. Again, Colin took our feedback and made it exactly what we wanted. We really appreciate all the work Colin put into capturing our day, and this videography package was one of the best investments we made. We will treasure these videos for the rest of our lives!

Colin has an incredible eye for detail and a clear creative vision, which translated into a wedding film that feels both cinematic and deeply personal.

If you are looking for a videographer who is talented, reliable, and a joy to collaborate with, we cannot recommend Colin highly enough. He exceeded all expectations and delivered something far beyond what we ever imagined.

Featherstone Wedding Films was great! Colin was so personable and took time to get to know us as a couple before our wedding during our phone consultation. The day of our wedding, ...

Colin and his second videographer were amazing and so kind to us and our family. They worked seamlessly with our photographer too. We honestly barely noticed they were there once they started filming! We received our sneak peek clip a couple days after the wedding and the final product within just a few weeks—both of which were beautifully edited. Colin is also one of the only videographers we found that allowed us to keep raw footage along with the edited videos, which was a plus for us. Really felt like a great value for the cost compared to other vendors we interviewed. We highly recommend Featherstone Wedding Films!

ootage without editing for a reasonable price. I'm so glad that we were able to find Terrence Vaden from Featherstone Films, who fit the bill 100% and did an excellent job. Though he was shooting our wedding by himself, he brought 3 cameras and did a fantastic job covering all the important moments of our wedding, some of which were in tricky, unconventional locations (such as a planetarium). He was able to record the footage directly onto my SD cards and deliver them back to me on my wedding night, which made the whole process logistically simple. When I discovered that I was missing a few clips that only recorded onto his own media, he was able to deliver them to me very promptly. I'm very pleased with the footage he shot and would happily recommend him to any other couple getting married in the Bay Area.

dding, but he and my photographer communicated to get on the same page/ timeline so I didn’t have to stress much about that either. The day of, him and his team were wonderful all day. They themselves were professional, and all his gear was as well. One of the things I appreciated most about Colin was his ability to be everywhere to get footage, but he was secretive about it, so those that are shy on camera didn’t feel pressured. My videos I got were AMAZING. I don’t know how many times we have watched the videos together or how many I’ve watched it alone but, every time feels like the first. It’s beautiful work and truly captured our wedding day and our personalities. We also got raw footage from him that had us cackling. It’s awesome seeing the day again through both the finished product and the raw footage. Thank you Colin for everything. I highly recommend Colin to everyone!! Ma

Featherstone was amazing! Everyone told me when I got engaged that the photos are one of the most important things. The day will pass, the food will be eaten, the flowers will die,...

and you'll probably never wear the dress again. The photos and video on the other hand live on for you to cherish time and time again. So when I ventured out in my search for the right photographer and videographer. I was nervous and I had never hired a professionals like this before. I had a few phone appointments with many other companies and though their work was beautiful, something didn't feel right. They all talked to me like I was just a customer. Prices this and prices that. This package and that package. I first came across Colin on the knot and on our first call I immediately loved him. He startrd off by first getting to know me and what things were important to me. Then he took the time to explain the process of hiring a professional photographer/videographer and let me ask all my questions. I never felt rushed and he made us feel important. Not just another customer. He was easily available through text, call, email throughout the entire process and responded so fast. The day of the wedding was perfect. They walked us through everything! We didn't have to stress about one thing. They took care of everything. Setting up the photo booth l, taking it down, and finding the best spots to capture our photos and video. They were very reliable! Last but not least. Their work was beautiful!! I trusted them completely from the start and they didn't disappoint us! Thank you Colin (videographer) and Maria (photographer) for being part of our special day and for capturing every moment of it for us to cherish forever.

nd I was on the fence. Colin and I had a lengthy phone call, plus email back and forth, in which he helped answer so many of my wedding planning questions, and guided our decisions without pushing one way or another. I am forever grateful for Colin and his honesty, as well as his wedding day expertise. He also helped us find our photographer, and our wedding day just wouldn't have been the same without them. We worked with Colin to create a more customized package than one of his traditional available, and when he sent us footage there were certain video shots that my husband and I were amazed by as we didn't even notice there was a camera nearby for that. I felt so supported by Colin throughout both the wedding planning process and my wedding day itself, and honestly even after the fact I know I could turn to him still. One of the last calls I had with Colin prior to the wedding day was about establishing timeline for everything. We didn't hire a wedding planner, and most of the planning was on my to-do list, and Colin provided me with recommendations for wedding flow. I felt such relief working with him too, and knew I could trust in him wholeheartedly. My husband and I are very pleased with Featherstone all around.

He has been responsive to our desires and requests as he has been putting together the wedding video, and we can’t wait to see it! Additionally, Colin provided the photo booth at our wedding reception, which was a huge hit! He provided fun props, and made it easy for people to get prints for themselves and duplicates for our guest book, or receive them digitally. Afterwards, we also received a link to the full album to enjoy them later. We were thrilled with Colin's work, and would happily recommend him to anyone!

Colin was amazing ! We had scheduled our wedding for Dec 2020. And were doing all the planning and well guess what, Covid happened. We had to postpone the big wedding for 6 months ...

(June 2021). Colin was gracious enough put us on the calendar for the new date and when June of 2021 came along Colin was there ready to go and did an absolute professional job at the wedding only intervening when he wanted certain video or to make sure we got something filmed that we wanted. Colin and his assistant were just amazing with their coverage of our wedding. I still can't believe he was able to capture in just a few short minutes the many hours of filming to exactly what we had thought up in our mind. Colin's pricing is affordable and reasonable, as well as his personal touch of getting to know the couple he is filming beforehand. Very much appreciated. Thanks Again Colin! From Jennifer and Jay (one year to the day of our celebration, sorry for the delay in sending review sooner).

lm and helpful that day. My mom had a hard time buttoning the back of my dress, and Colin stepped in and helped her. He and his assistant were extremely professional and captured all the moments I was hoping would be caught. My husband and I can now look back at our wedding thanks to Colin and all of his hard work to make our wedding video perfect. Another example of how accommodating he is: the dj we had played a bunch songs that were not on our play list. The last song while we were dancing I truly do not like but it was in the video. I asked Colin is there anyway to play over that song at the end of our wedding. He worked his magic and played a song that I originally wanted the dj to play. Aaaaamazing! I mean if you want a videographer that has a great personality, hard worker, talented and just kind, look no further, Colin is your man!

lin made the planning experience as stress-free as possible. He offers flexible packages, and the finished product was beautiful. We also thought the finished product was completed in a very timely manner (we had our final video about 1 month after the wedding). On the actual wedding day Colin and his assistant were enjoyable to be around, and they fit in with us and our guests seamlessly without feeling awkward. Working with Colin was exactly what I was hoping for during the stress of wedding planning and during the anxiety of the actual wedding day. We've watched our film several times now, and we love it. We'll be able to cherish our favorite wedding moments for years to come. I would highly recommend Colin (Featherstone Wedding Films)!

Our wedding pictures and video are so beautiful, I wouldn’t recommend anyone but them!

We have booked Colin with Featherstone Films for our May 2022 wedding, but could not wait that long to sing his praises! We did an engagement shoot with him about a month ago, and ...

the results were incredible. We showed his 90-second video to family friends, and got both laughter and tears! Colin is incredibly good at what he does, and will leave you with beautifully and professionally edited videos that perfectly capture the feeling of the day, whether it’s an engagement shoot (which we definitely recommend) or your wedding day. We will treasure ours for years to come. Beyond his talent for making videos, he is communicative, knowledgeable, transparent, professional, and works well with other vendors, even those he’s never met before. Our engagement shoot also included our photographer, and she and Colin got on super well. We’re so excited to work with him again for our wedding, and know that we’re in the best of hands. If you’re reading this, reach out to Colin for your wedding day.

His compilation video was excellent and well edited. His professionalism and ability to capture various moments throughout the day without being overbearing and feeling as if we were just being dragged around was perfect. He also provides a photo booth and we were provided all the digital prints to see how much our guests enjoyed the occasion. Colin's services and final product was well worth it and very reasonable in pricing. I would highly recommend him for any other wedding! Plus he's a Star Wars and Game of Thrones fan, which this bride and groom are fans of as well, what's not to love? We are very grateful to have found Colin to capture our special day.
