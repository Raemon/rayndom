## What Colors Go with Lilac Bridesmaid Dresses?

Lilac, like most other pastel hues, fits perfectly with just about any hue, which means options abound when it comes to accessorizing. The same holds true when it comes to [mismatched bridesmaid dresses](https://www.theknot.com/content/mismatched-bridesmaids-dress-tips)—think: solid lilac frocks, patterned lilac gowns and lilac gowns of varying lengths and silhouettes. For example, you can opt for silver or gold jewelry as well as different colored shoes—though more on that below. Similarly, in terms of handbags and clutches, anything goes from navy and white to black and nude. 

Additionally, when it comes to makeup, you can't go wrong with soft hues like light pinks, neutrals and pale golds. For example, a copper, bronze or champagne eyeshadow shade would look especially great with a lilac bridesmaid dress. Alternatively, for a more dramatic look and a bold pop of color, you may even opt for a hint of purple. 

### What color shoes go with lilac bridesmaid dresses?

Consider pairing your lilac bridesmaid dress with a beige or nude shoe, combining style and sophistication. By opting for one of these neutral shades, you're keeping the focus on the frock itself, drawing the eyes to the pretty pastel hue. That said, beige or nude aren't your only options. For a summer soiree, a white shoe is especially apropos, while a silver hue offers an extra touch of elegance, making it a prime pick for black-tie affairs. We also have you covered with more [bridesmaid shoe](https://www.theknot.com/content/the-best-shoes-for-brides-and-bridesmaids) inspiration to get those creative juices flowing.
