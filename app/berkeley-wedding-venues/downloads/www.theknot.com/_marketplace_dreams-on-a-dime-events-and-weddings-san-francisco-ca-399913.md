We can confidently say that our dream wedding would not have been possible without Jessica to help us plan things every step of the way. We were so excited about our venue, Califor...

nia Academy of Sciences (CAS), but it has a lot of moving pieces & we needed someone who knew the venue well. Luckily for us, Jessica knows CAS like the back of her hand & all the vendors who frequently staff it as well, which made communication and coordination much more streamlined. There were so many details to the venue that we wouldn’t have considered but that she managed and kept on track (for example, very short time frame for vendor set up). She was very responsive and organized through the whole process & also kept things running smoothly during the very busy wedding day. We also have a newfound appreciation for the name of her company, Dreams on a Dime, because Jessica helped us achieve our dream vision but without breaking the bank. She has many connections within the industry & knows the people who do quality work but for a more reasonable price. We highly recommend her for wedding planning, especially if you’re considering CAS.

Cierra from Dreams on a Dime was incredible to work with and made our wedding day run so smoothly. She was super responsive and met with us over Zoom multiple times (and once in pe...

rson) to make sure every detail was covered. She had the answer to all of our questions and helped build the most detailed wedding timeline — down to the minute — so everything stayed perfectly on track. Our rehearsal went seamlessly with her guidance on how to walk and even how parents should hold arms. On the wedding day, everything flowed beautifully. I was nervous to walk down the aisle, but Cierra reassured me and helped calm my anxiety. The reception looked stunning, she helped bustle my dress with ease, and at the end of the night, she packed everything up neatly for us to pick up later. I couldn’t have asked for a better coordinator!

I cannot every begin to describe how amazing Jessica Franklin was as our month of coordinator. As a very anxious person, she took all of the stress out of planning the final detail...

s. She took time to answer all of our questions, give us advice where we needed it, and helped pull of the details together. On the day, she kept everything moving and allowed me and my husband to truly enjoy our day. Her and her team helped with set up and clean up, helped wrangle our families, and kept everything fully on time. I absolutely cannot recommend her enough.

Jessica will make thousands- dollar design changes without telling you. But first, Jessica is great for planning and helping us keep on top of all the little details. She's very ...

knowledgeable in her industry. However, Jessica falls short on execution. After we walked the aisle, we couldn't find her all night. Apparently we also paid for her assistant, but we were never introduced and they were also MIA on the day of. My husband baked our desserts at her urging, to save us money. He had this whole design planned out for his display. We listened to Jessica who told us to let the caterers take over setting up so we can relax and enjoy the day. However, the caterers didn't take care in setting up the desserts to his plans and the DJ never announced that desserts were ready. We didn't even get first bite nor photos. My biggest gripe is that she changed my lighting design without telling us. I had to ask her the day after, where my colored uplights went, as if she thought I would never bring it up! I wanted different colors of light everywhere but she toned it down to blush pink. Not anywhere in our year of planning, did we ask for simple elegance. My one negotiable was all the color uplights to make things pop. I was expecting my wow- moment of color everywhere, despite multiple inspiration photos of the exact look they've done before in my venue. She stole my $1600 rainbow. I'm very disappointed in how she's fixing this problem by ghosting me. It'll be two months next week since my wedding and she hasn't responded. It's more than just the actual cost of the lights, there's also emotional damages that are unaccounted for.

We love that she’s incredibly accommodating and also knows when to nudge us. She helped make our wedding day incredibly low-stress and joyous!! She’s everything we wanted in a wedding coordinator, and we would wholeheartedly recommend her and your team to our friends. Thanks again!! 🫶🏼

Jessica Leigh was a wonderful and professional planner for our wedding in May 2024! We started working with her months in advance of the wedding and she was supportive and creative...

in helping us find vendors, plan out complicated aspects, and stick to our schedule in booking everything we needed (particularly as we did a fairly DIY wedding for ~130 people). In the last month she was very hands-on when we needed her to be in contacting the vendors, putting together a minute-by-minute day-of schedule, helping us work through last-minute challenges, and answering any questions / concerns we had. On the day of the wedding, she showed up hours early to get us situated and then took care of all of the complicated logistics (particularly with our vendors) in the background, allowing us to just enjoy the day. She welcomed our vendors, made sure they were prepped and ready when they needed to be, and paid and departed without worry. She also gently nudged us (without being stressful or pushy) when we fell behind schedule, to ensure we didn't miss anything. After the wedding, she followed up to make sure we had everything taken care of and offered her support if there was anything else we needed. Would highly recommend to any soon-to-be wedded couples out there! She helped a nervous bride and groom de-stress before, during, and after the big day, which is the best we could possibly ask for.

Cierra was a pleasure to work with. So clam during the whole process. Since we were planning from abroad, we hired her on partial planning. She made regular calls possible, making ...

the times work, and always reassured me that I was on track. And when we had to ramp up the couple months before, she handled everything and nudged me on the last minute decision I had to make, helping me to prioritise. On the day she was fabulous (handling our cake mishap well) and even afterwards. I highly recommend working with Cierra.

Cierra Wilkins is an absolute dream. She was so incredible to work with, and jumped in to rescue us during a very stressful turn of events in our wedding planning (we ended up havi...

ng to terminate our contract with another planner who dropped the ball). The first thing Cierra did was tell us straight up that she didn't want us paying for services we weren't going to need, and that given how much work we'd already done on the planning process, she didn't feel we needed to pay for the "partial planning" package. Instead, she honestly and transparently shared that we would probably be best suited going for the month-of package, which would allow us to schedule as many meetings as we needed leading up to the wedding (beyond just the month of), but that we would continue to source our own vendors. We really appreciated the honesty, because she was right - I had already done most of the work on finding vendors and really didn't need that level of support. Cierra was so gracious, transparent, and helpful. She kept us on track, shared timelines for needed deliverables, was super responsive to emails when we had questions, and really helped keep this project manager of a bride in balance. Everything leading up to the wedding was a breeze. Everyone kept commenting on how relaxed I seemed, and it was because I knew we (and in particular, Cierra) had things covered! At one point during the rehearsal, she had to tell me to back off (very politely of course) and allow her to take over and orchestrate everything (much to my husband's delight) because I was so used to running the show. It was so nice to realize that I could let go and allow her to take over. The wedding day was a dream. Everything ran smoothly and we all had a blast. It was beautiful, it was festive, and everything operated like a well-oiled machine, with Cierra pulling the levers behind the scenes. THANK YOU, Cierra, for helping us host such a wonderful, joyous, and mostly stress-free wedding. You are the best!!

y member. During our initial video call with Cierra, she explained all the tasks she would be taking care of and it opened our eyes to how much planning and coordination our big day was going to take. Hiring Cierra was one of the best decisions we made for our wedding and we wouldn’t change anything about it. Although we selected the “month-of” option, we were able to ask questions and get advice throughout the entire process. Cierra reviewed contracts and calmed any anxieties we had while making such big decisions. The peace of mind she gave us, being new to planning such a large event, was priceless. As we got close to the event, Cierra started working directly with our other vendors, creating a master timeline for everyone. This freed up the space for us to focus on other things and enjoy the weeks leading up to our wedding rather than be stressed out. On the day of, Cierra did all the set up and tear down. We were able to just walk into the reception hall after the ceremony and be amazed at how wonderful everything turned out. It truly was a dream and we couldn’t have imagined a more perfect day, and we have Cierra to thank for making it happen!

She was always so responsive and really wanted us to have the wedding we wanted. She was so sweet and understanding, especially since we didn't want a traditional wedding. When I told her our ideas, she would always check her sources to provide input on what would make things easier or work within our schedule and budget. She was never pushy and always was very supportive and accommodating. I never felt ignored and she was truly a pleasure to work with. Even our other vendors complimented her work and how she stayed on top of everything for us. I didn't have to worry about anything the day of the wedding as she handled any issues right away without bothering us about it. However, she made sure to check in with us and keep us updated throughout the night on where we stood and if we had any questions or concerns. We definitely recommend her and are truly thankful to have worked with her. You won't regret picking/hiring her for your planning needs, big or small!

he perfect venue to packing up the presents after the reception, Jessica was a godsend. I don't know what I would have done without her and cannot recommend her enough. We signed up for the mid-level coordination package which includes day-of coordination and help before the wedding, and that was a perfect fit for us and very reasonably priced. Jessica helped us find vendors, confirm contracts, and work out logistics. She spent a lot of time on the phone and on email with us making sure we felt ready for the day, and it was so nice to wake up Saturday morning feeling like everything was in a great place. The day of coordination was more than exceptional. Jessica had a lovely assistant with her. Together they ensured that months of careful planning were realized without a hitch -- at least that I know about! That's the brilliant thing about Jessica. If anything went wrong, I had no hint of it -- thanks to her, was perfectly insulated from the set-up and the coordination so I could focus on getting ready. And everything was flawless -- not just to me, but to everyone who came up and told me what a great wedding it was. I know from working events in my professional life that there is no way that everything went that smoothly behind the scenes (there's always something wrong, like not enough clean glasses or too many folks want the fish for their main dish -- it can't be helped). But thanks to Jessica, I never had to hear about it and from my perspective it was the smoothest, nicest, most wonderful and relaxing experience I could have dreamed of. I really can't thank Jessica enough for making my wedding better than I could have ever dreamed. I hope this review comes close to showing her how much I appreciate her help, her advice, and her as a person! Future brides, don't dawdle! Hire her now!!

We decided half way through out wedding planning that we would need a "Day-Of" Coordinator so that our family wouldn't have to work and could relax and enjoy our day. We were so v...

ery fortunate to find Cierra with Dreams On A Dime. She was absolutely fabulous! Their rates are very reasonable, she met with me and completely understood my vision. She was very responsive up until our wedding, completed my timeline which was overwhelming for me and contacted all of my vendors prior to the wedding with their arrival and set up times. I was able to rent the apothecary jars and she set up my candy buffet, favors, and aisle runner for me. Truly spectacular and the most important thing you can do for yourself. Trust me, she was worth every penny! All of our guests had a fabulous, relaxing time and some of our older relatives said it was the best wedding they have ever attended.

In beginning to plan our wedding, it became clear to me that a Day of Coordinator was absolutely necessary. My initial thought was "no way" but I soon realized that my friends were...

right and that I needed to find someone. In steps Dreams on a Dime. I worked with Cierra to finalize a day of timeline, collect contracts, contact information, etc. Without her expertise, I'm sure the wedding would not have been as smooth. From the moment the day began, it was smooth sailing - I have to attribute so much of that to Cierra's hard work. Nothing went wrong and everything went right... Cierra was the perfect addition to make sure that our wedding day went off without a hitch and was at the right price. For those of you brides wanting that little bit of extra help, I encourage you to call Cierra - her fee is well worth your sanity on your wedding day!

Without Jessica and Dreams on a Dime, our wedding would have been chaos! We had Jessica for day-of coordination only, because I work for a catering and event company and have a re...

gular relationship with all of the vendors I was using. Every wedding I have been to has run about 10-30 minutes behind schedule. We ran about 20 minutes AHEAD of schedule all night! She was so easy to work with during the last month or so leading up to the wedding. She asked me questions about things that I hadn't even thought about, and offered great suggestions. On the day, she took charge of everything that I would normally be in charge of on site at our events (my company catered) and made sure that I just relaxed, had everything I needed and enjoyed the day. Most importantly, she made sure that I ate something! And I envy her emergency kit! Anything you could ever imagine needing, she had it and then some. 5 stars isn't enough for Jessica and her team!! If you are looking for affordable, professional and superior coordination for either day-of or full service, look no further!!

Jessica and her assistant were invaluable to us at our wedding. I highly recommend and suggest you have a wedding planner, especially Jessica for your wedding. Jessica thought of ...

details that never crossed my mind, worked with my vendors to ensure everything went smoothly. She really helped out with the wedding time line, which you may think is really easy, but I found out it can be very frustrating. She took it out of my hands and gave me a completed time lime that made sense! This is an example of how she can take your stress away. The day of my wedding, I had no idea of what was going with setup, breakdown, anything in between b/c Jessica and her assistant took care of everything. All I did was enjoy my day and for that I thank Jessica!
