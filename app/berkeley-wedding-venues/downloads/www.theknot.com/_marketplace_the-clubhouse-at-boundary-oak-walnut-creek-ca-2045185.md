gelique was amazing in assisting us with every aspect of coordinating the event. Throughout the process, she handled all of our questions and was quick to handle any issues that arose. The food was outstanding, much better than we anticipated, and we received many compliments from the guests. The facility offered a beautiful area for a cocktail reception following a ceremony overlooking the greenery of the golf course. The attention to detail in every aspect was amazing. Overall, the entire staff staff was attentive and pleasant, providing excellent customer service. The ability to work with their preferred vendors, from the DJ, florist, etc. made the coordination of the event so easy. Pricing was reasonable and flexible. We couldn't have been happier with the level of service, quality of food and the customer service provided.

lism, warmth, and attention to detail were top tier. We toured seven venues before choosing Boundary Oak, and it was the combination of stunning grounds and exceptional customer service that sealed the deal for us. Our initial food tasting was decent—typical wedding food—but a new head chef joined about six months before our wedding. The improvement was noticeable and really elevated our reception meal. Our guests raved about the food! If I had to give any constructive feedback, it would be regarding the bridal suite. While functional, it could definitely benefit from an upgrade. Adding a private bathroom and a lock on the door would make a huge difference in comfort and privacy for the bride on such an important day. Overall, we had a fantastic experience at Boundary Oak and are so grateful to Angelique and the entire team for helping make our day so special!

red and at what price. Angelique was awesome and was there throughout the whole thing. She was responsive to all of my technical questions after we booked the venue. When it came to our rehearsal and the day of the wedding, Angelique was very organized and gave everyone clear instructions on what was going to happen. She kept me up to date while I stayed in the bridal suite. The venue is basically in the hills, which looks out over the town. The ceremony site is easy to reach; you can see the water fountain at the back of the arch of the ceremony site. The reception room was large and had enough room that people were not squished to bump into anyone or anything. Also, the bridal suite was opened early and was large enough to hold a large crowd. Overall, it was a beautiful venue, and to see it in its full glory was breathtaking.

balcony was also ours. Everyone just loved the view, the dinner, the whole setup. The staff was so great, courteous, professional, thoughtful and wonderful! We ended up with 4 additional guests and the staff immediately brought in 2 smaller tables to accommodate us without any problem. Thank you, Angelique, for taking such care of us during the past 6 months. It was a pleasurable experience and I expect to be here at our 70th reunion.

nally we saw so many space that offered half of what Boundary Oak offered for twice the price! We couldn't believe what we were getting for what we were paying, a true hidden gem! But the selling point was Melissa and Lilly, it was a big deal to us to have an onsite coordination team that we really connected with and we felt that right away. They were always very communicative and open to questions/ideas. You could really feel that their main goal was to make sure our day was what we wanted it to be. The day went off without a hitch, thanks to the team! The bridal suite was lovely, the ease and connivence of the spaces made the guest comfortable, keeping the focus on the wedding. We additionally got lucky enough to experience the NEWLY UPDATED ceremony space!! It's such an upgrade! You have to check it out! Working with the Boundary Oak team was truly a magical experience, and our day wouldn't have been as great as it was without them!

njoyed working with her. Since both my husband and I were one of the first ones to get married among our friends, we weren't super familiar with this whole wedding planning process. Lilly offered us so much guidance and tips which made our planning much easier. Lilly was very attentive to detail, accommodating to our needs, and made sure things went smoothly on the day of our wedding. Just a few days before the wedding, I had a last minute question for Lilly, but because it was New Year's Eve, I wasn't really expecting a reply from her right away. But she did on the very next day, on January 1st! This says something about her work ethic and how much she cares about her clients.. :) Overall, we were very satisfied with Boundary Oak and would definitely recommend Lilly as a wedding coordinator!

y, cocktail area has plenty of tables/places to sit indoors and outdoors with a great view; bathrooms are very clean with enough stalls; and bridal suite is huge, with a view and a lovely area to hangout/get ready! We worked with Melissa and Lilly throughout the planning process and are ultimately happy with the outcome. With each meeting we went over specific details of our wedding event from table cloths, to the day of timeline, what was left on our checklist of vendors, etc. The day went smoothly with their guidance during the planning process. As first time (and last time) wedding planners, it is always nice to have some feedback from someone who is experienced, I would say Lilly was much more helpful with this. We had a good, but not a perfect experience with some room for improvement, so taking one star away because of this. 1) Responsiveness could have been better: many times we would have to call/email for followup if we didn’t get an initial response from an email/voicemail left. 2) Communication: We were nearly double charged a $3000 payment. After a phone conversation with Lilly to agree to the charge, a couple days later I received an email from Melissa requesting permission to charge my card for the same payment. Likely an honest mistake due to lack of intercommunication, but not to be taken lightly. 3) Organization: We had scheduled our rehearsal several months in advance (around the time we booked the venue). Many bridal party members had planned around this date/time. We found out about a month and a half before our event that another wedding was booked at the same time and had to reschedule the rehearsal. Unfortunately, some members missed the rehearsal because of this and plans for that day had to be shuffled. Again, likely an honest mistake, but likely due to some lack of organization. We would have appreciated being notified much earlier so that the participants could plan accordingly. We definitely appreciated the complimentary upgrade with the chargers to make up for this! 4) Follow-through: Overall our wedding day event went very smoothly. The only moment that could have been handled better was the transition between cocktail hour and reception. During a prior meeting, Lilly emphasized the importance of sticking to the schedule so that we can squeeze in sunset pictures and discussed her role in making sure this happens. Naturally, this set up some expectations from myself, the photographer and videographer. However, Melissa and Lilly were nowhere to be found during that time! My MOH had to start shuffling guests herself 5)Transparency: We asked for a summary of charges/receipt from the open bar, our credit card was charged but we never received even a receipt, still waiting to this day. A tip to brides! Keep in mind the Bridal party cannot use the Bridal suite until 12pm, I wish we could have gotten ready at the venue, but we had to book a hotel to get ready as our hair/makeup artist needed to start around 8:30am to make sure everyone would be ready by our first look at 2:30pm. The bridal suite looked like a great place to hang out with bridesmaids with snacks and champagne to enjoy, but we didn’t really get to use it. TLDR: Overall, very happy with this venue! Good coordination, but some room for improvement.

e sweetheart. She answered all of my crazy questions with the kindest of words & worked with my personal coordinator every step of the way. The ceremony site located next to the lake is just breathtaking & even though the site is on the grass the aisle that you walk down is cement which is perfect when wearing heels. Highlights: -Beautiful ceremony location -The bridal suite is perfect, with a spectacular fruit/cheese plate & champagne (depending on your package) -Friendly and attentive coordinator -Plenty of parking -Large reception room -Different color options for chairs, napkins, etc. -Two bars, one for happy hour and one for the reception -The food! Some of the best wedding food I have ever had. And the hors d'oeuvres were just as tasty (try the brie & pear phyllo cups and the ahi poki wonton cups -Different bar packages depending on your budget I could go on forever. Really, such an incredible experience. If you want a professional, beautiful, fantastic wedding, contact Boundary Oak.

mmodating. They were very flexible with whatever we needed done. Our wedding was mostly DIY so we needed to see the venue often to practice and check to see if our ideas would fly. If the venue wasn’t in use, they would allow us to try our ideas out. We even got to prep the place the day before the actual ceremony so we wouldn’t have to stress the day of. Because of all this, our wedding went pretty smoothly and not much worry. Charlene was great with brainstorming ideas with us to make sure all the ideas made sense. So good in fact that in a relatively short period of planning (6 months), the wife and I were able to take a weekend off of planning to just chill. What more can we say, they are just awesome and we would love to have our anniversary celebrations here because we love this venue so much. The scenery, location, and tranquil atmosphere makes this a smashing success for any wedding.

mony at the lakeside ceremony site, our cocktail hour in the Mira Vista room, and our reception in the Celebration room. Every staff member that I interacted with was friendly, efficient, and helpful. The Catering director was responsive during our initial contract discussions, and worked with me to fit everything into our budget, even before we signed the dotted line! Their packages are extremely reasonable based on my research, especially on Friday or Sunday. The tables, basic chairs, linens and napkins, staff (including day of coordination), food, set up and break down are all included, not to mention FLOOR LENGTH linens as the default! They offer lots of luxe upgrades if you want them, but we actually went with the Gold package, and our only upgrade was to buffet instead of plated and everything was gorgeous! We did end up scoring a few upgrades for free though :) We worked closely with Charlene, our onsite and day of coordinator, and she was extremely responsive and very flexible and helpful! She worked with us on every detail, and had great suggestions for keeping things in our budget, while still getting everything we wanted! The day went off without a hitch, and we could not have been happier with how everything came together! If you have a modest budget and big wedding dreams, I whole-heartedly recommend Boundary Oak!

There are so many things about the Clubhouse @ Boundary Oak that drew me in as a bride on a budget. Here are my faves: 1\. Space - The ENTIRE Clubhouse is reserved for you an...

d your guests when you book them for your day. The place is huge! With any other venue I saw, they rented by room, or have an outrageous price for a venue buyout. With Boundary Oak, that is a non issue. 2\. Pricing - They are very amenable to negotiating what they offer in order to accommodate your budget. Just tell them what is the most important thing to you, (in my case it was an open bar) and they will do their best give you what you need and still stay within your budget. 3\. The bridal suite - It's so nice to get ready there with your girls, as opposed to your house or a hotel. It is more than enough space to fit in at least 10 bridesmaids (though I only had 5). They serve you champagne, cheese, fruits and breads as you get ready. Such a nice touch. 4\. Coordinator - Charlene was such a sweetheart throughout the whole planning process. She addresses your concerns quickly and stays in constant contact with you. She's also very organized, so even if you don't know what you're doing with the planning process, she makes it easy for you. 5\. The food/beverages are amazing! Everyone was talking about the salad we chose after the wedding. The beef is tender and the chicken is moist. So tasty and elegantly plated. All in all, I am so happy with my choice in having my wedding reception at the Clubhouse at Boundary Oak. There's no better place I could've pictured my wedding to have been. Thank you Boundary Oak Staff! You are the best!

I really lucked out with this venue and the packages were great! I found one that was able to provide me with a beautiful wedding. The ladies Emily and Charlene were beyond awesome...

! They truly made it possible for me to plan my wedding alone and stress free. The golf course is beautiful in itself so I chose not to spend money on decorating. My wedding was on 5.31.14. I used their centerpieces included in our package and added bunches of flowers to them. They helped out all the way until the reception! My 4 year old daughter had a melt down and Emily went out of her way to comfort her. The bridal suite does not have locks and I was told by bridesmaids that one of them hung out in the room to keep an eye on our belongings. There is a beautiful oak tree that we took time during the reception to be carted out to for pictures! My guest keep telling me how beautiful it wAs and I feel I just picked the right venue that created that beauty! I recommend those who do not hire a coordinator which I did not, enlist a close family member /friend to troubleshoot and keep and eye on the timeline of the evening. Our event was only 5.5 hours and a lot had to happen during that time, it happened though! The venue waS super helpful when my photo booth person arrived unprepared and they provided him with an extension cord. I highly Recommend this venue for a stress free And budget friendly venue!!

My mother made my husband and i look at 12 different venues before we were able to pick a site for our wedding. While this was one of the last ones we looked at we knew right away ...

that this was going to be the place. I was able to set up an appointment with Emily to view the venue with just a few emails. While we were looking at the venue they were very friendly and we were able to meet some of the other employees that would be there the day of the wedding should we choose their site. We were also invited back later that day or another weekend to see what their site looked like all set up. During the planning of the wedding, Charlene was very helpful. Whenever i had a question about anything I would just send an email and get a response usually within the same day or the following day. There were also a few times when I would get a response from her on her day off. We did both our rehearsal dinner and full wedding there. Emily and Charlene both made planning my wedding fun and easy. I was never worried about anything. My father only drinks white Zinfandel, which they do not normally serve but they made sure to have six bottles on hand for my rehearsal dinner and wedding. I couldn't have asked for a better wedding.

We looked at many venues for over a year. We finally came up with three. When we mention this to Boundary Oak, they made us an offer we could refuse. So cliche, I know. However...

, they lived up to our every expectation and then some. We booked the entire venue for our wedding. The wedding was held outside on a beautiful, not too hot, day. My guest complimented us on the champagne, tea and cucumber water that was served throughout the ceremony. Our guests are still talking about how great the food was. One guest said, "I've been to many weddings and the food was mediocre. The food served was fantastic and the presentation was outstanding." I agreed with this guest. The staff and management of the establishment remained in continuous contact with us, always checking if there was anything else they could do. We had a problem with our guest list and Boundary Oak was very accommodating and understanding. Another guest loved the facility so much, she has scheduled her company holiday party there! Thanks Boundary Oak for making my day so memorable.

I choose Boundary Oak because the location was beautiful and I managed to fit the package I wanted into my budget. The location is easy to get to and I had no worries about guests ...

getting lost. The food was excellent, but my main concern was that my contact person kept changes due to turn over at the location. I had a hard time getting ahold of them at times and it was hard to schedule a meeting to discuss my event details. Also, they set up the tables differently than was in the layout which caused my table numbers to be wrong and people were sitting at the wrong table. It all ended up working out and I had the time of my life, but I felt that they could have been more attentive to me in the planning process.

We planned our wedding here and the pictures came out beautiful. We had our wedding at 4 PM on the golf course, and they provided an arch and the set up. They were running a spec...

ial for Friday and Sunday dates, so we got a great deal. We had about 90 guests. Overall, very pleased with how everything turned out, and the wait staff the day of were wonderful. The food was very good. The only disappointment was that the venue coordinator waited until the last minute to check on the table overlays we wanted, and sprung on me last minute that their vendor didn't have the right size for my tables, giving me two hours to pick something else - not fun. Other than that, the day of the wedding went fine, just make sure you keep tabs on all the details ahead of time. It's little hiccups like these that were acceptable for the exceptional price, but were definitely extra stress. Overall, beautiful place. I would recommend.

We loved the view - it's the best in town. And the very large deck to enjoy the cocktail hour on and we liked that the bar was in the main room.

I loved how the room looked. The way they do weddings at Blake's is very classy. I loved that the dance floor was in the middle and they let me have my table on risers with the h...

ead table feel. The people were very specific with details.;Ask if you can take pictures by the willow tree, they will try to talk you into taking them by the oak tree but it is nothing to be excited about. The willow tress is right by a pond and is much more picturesque. If you are having a wedding on a Saturday or other popular day be aware they there are likely other events going on at the same time, making the staff have to spread their time among all of them. Blake's is having trouble with the city, with whom they rent the place from and they are likely loosing their lease soon. Just be aware.

Blake's is family-owned, so they were so easy to work with. We told them what our budget was and they worked with us to make our day special without going over the budget. the fo...

od, location, cocktail hour and set up for the ceremony were spectacular! They were also amazing when we had so many problems with the church and pulled the wedding 10 days before to have it on the golf course. We recommend this location to everyone!;Make sure you receive any extra cash from the unused bar tab the night of the event, otherwise it takes some time to get back.
