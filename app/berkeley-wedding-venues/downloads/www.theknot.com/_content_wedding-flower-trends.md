![2026 floral trend: sunken meadow centerpieces](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/8fd4e205-f434-4499-aa6f-15eee4849ef1~rs_768.h)

To see one of the top wedding floral trends, look down. What we're coining as "sunken meadows" are starting to sprawl around and in between reception tables in lieu of traditional tabletop centerpieces. Florists are arranging wispy grasses, mounds of fluffy petals and stems that stand tall to mimic a meadow or garden sprouting from the ground. These arrangements emphasize and move with the shape of the tables (whether they're arranged in a closed rectangle or in a snaking curve). The overall look feels ultra immersive and provides a show-stopper of a centerpiece that won't block any sightlines as a bonus.

Florist Jennifer Bernal, the creative eye behind [House of Bernal](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/house-of-bernal-middletown-ny-2064082), notes that the sunken-meadow ethos has even carried over to tabletops: "The 'grown-in-place' aesthetic, where florals look as if they're sprouting directly from the table, will also continue to evolve. Some designers are fabricating tables with recessed channels so the florals appear to emerge organically from the surface."

## 2\. Victorian-Era Bouquets 

![2026 floral trend: Victorian-era bouquet blossoms](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/2e9a4dab-0e75-4cb2-9896-fb66af0c5b64~rs_768.h)

One of the top floral trends for 2026 is kicking it back to the 1800s, with two blooms dominating the bouquet landscape: calla lilies and lily of the valley. Petite, monofloral bundles of these blooms are appearing more and more. Floriography (the use of flowers to communicate covert messages) was common in the 1800s and, considering the meaning behind both of these blossoms, it makes sense that these flowers were carried by couples. Calla lilies symbolize purity and innocence, while lilies of the valley represent sweetness and a "return to happiness." In our current era, we think these flowers are having a resurgence as classic aesthetics rise overall. 

"Couples are revisiting classic wedding staples such as calla lilies, but reimagined with a modern twist through unexpected color palettes, mixed materials or contemporary styling," says Rhonda Smith of [August, Sage and Violet](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/august-sage-and-violet-brooklyn-ny-958076).

## 3\. Long-Stem and Exposed-Stem Bouquets

Behind every beautiful bouquet is a bunch of sturdy stems holding it together. And when it comes to wedding floral trends for 2026, stems are getting treated as part of the bouquet's design, not something to be wrapped in ribbon and forgotten. Long-stemmed bouquets are becoming popular for marriers who gravitate toward wedding flowers that are modern, as they add an architectural element that contrasts with any frilly petals that might be involved. In addition to stems going great lengths, they're also showing up as they are in all of their woody, verdant glory. Exposed stems are gaining traction, which brings a fresh-picked feel to bouquets.

### Find your kind of venue

From barns to ballrooms, discover reception venues that feel like you.

## 4\. Monochrome and Monofloral Moments

Perhaps paralleling the lean toward monochromatic wedding color palettes, arrangements and bouquets that include one type of flower or focus on a single shade continue to grow in popularity from last year. Whether they appear as a funky organic pile or a massive installation, this wedding flower trend feels modern and effortlessly cool. Plus, cutting down on the number of flower varieties you use will keep you closer to the [average cost of wedding flowers](https://www.theknot.com/content/average-cost-wedding-flowers) (and not too far over). And by the way, white is the shade du jour when it comes to modern wedding flowers in 2026. 

Tiffany Weinbender, floral designer and creative director of [Ida Mayes Floral Design House](https://www.idamayes.com/), noticed this trend taking root in 2025: "Flowers-en-masse has been elevated to another level with funky textures and mass groupings of like flowers creating bold, impactful floral designs that are also more minimalistic in flower varieties."

## 5\. Otherworldly, Sculptural Flowers and Designs

![anthurium red wedding tablescape](https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/fda90e5c-363b-406e-ae79-56d4036541ef~rs_768.h-cr_0.0.1067.1423)

_[Photo: Amanda Young](https://amandayoungphoto.com/),__[Flowers: Sweet Talk Floral](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/sweet-talk-floral-providence-ri-1101335)_

The nexus where sculpture meets softness is at the core of the latest wedding flower trends. Some arrangements in this category take form as a softer take on ikebana, others as curving, draping floral clusters, and a few as the highly requested "flower mounds" that "grow" from the ground or table sans vase. Add a query about which iteration looks best with your wedding aesthetic to your list of [questions to ask your wedding florist](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-florist-questions-before-hiring).

"We're seeing a lot of sculptural floral designs that are more artistic and architectural in approach," says Smith. "Many couples are seeking statement pieces that function as design focal points, whether they be on tables, for the ceremony, on bars or in the entrance of their venues." 

Additionally, if you think you've been seeing far less fluffy petals and more architectural shapes when it comes to what flowers are used for weddings, you're totally onto something. Flowers with stark, modern silhouettes like edgy anthurium and classic calla lilies are taking center stage as the modern wedding flowers of the moment, along with amaranthus, [hanging wedding flowers](https://www.theknot.com/content/hanging-reception-ceremony-flowers) known for their alien-like cascading tendrils that truly feel like they're from another planet. 

"Calla Lilies are definitely continuing to see a comeback and being used in new ways, mixing a bit of contemporary and eclectic design styles," said Weinbender of the trend. These [popular wedding flowers](https://www.theknot.com/content/top-10-wedding-flowers) hit the perfect middle ground between trendy and traditional, while anthurium and amaranthus can offer an extra layer of color-palette personalization.

## 6\. Fruit + Florals

Just as we saw in 2025, flowers will continue to work in tandem with fruits and vegetables to create a tablescape vignette straight out of a still-life painting in 2026. The resulting look is eclectic and feels like one of the most [unique wedding flower ideas](https://www.theknot.com/content/unique-wedding-flower-ideas), especially if you stud the fruits with gems or pearls or use offbeat vegetables that bring tons of texture alongside your blooms. 

"Adding fruit and vegetables as part of the tablescape has been a classic, and I've seen the variations from looking like a still-life painting to the creation of sculptures with fruits and veggies," says Gilberto Freihoff of [Dogwood and Fir](https://dogwoodandfir.com/). The resulting vibe is fresh and earthy and feels feast-like when thoughtfully illuminated by candlelight in the manner of a Dutch Masters' painting.

"Statement ceilings are going nowhere, but they're evolving," says Bernal. The florist notes that the hanging flower arrangements of 2026 will feel "airy and abundant," which brings us to the next entry on our list of 2026 wedding flower trends: suspended floral garlands. 

We're seeing these pieces of petal-forward decor take shape most as strands of calla lilies (they are truly the blossom of the moment) strung up by the ends of their stems to look like an elegant necklace. Some iterations show the flowers spaced apart to let the light flow between, others are positioned close together and use varying stem lengths to create a curtain-like shape, with peaks and valleys that swoop gracefully.

Waterfalls of heavenly white blossoms will be spilling over the lips of urns and down the sides of dinner tables, bars and more in 2026. These trending floral arrangements walk the line between romantic and minimalist, making them the ideal choice for couples opting for a soft and subtle aesthetic. 

White tulips in particular are at the forefront of this trend, with stems as slender as a swan's neck. Bernal notes that couples are gravitating toward blooms that feel "alive and expressive," and tulips fit the bill for many of her marriers.

Greenery isn't just a filler material. We're seeing it come back as the star of the show as couples gravitate toward a naturalistic approach, rivaling some of the other trending flowers on this list in beauty and impact. Botanicals that you could forage from your own backyard, like ivy, mint sprigs and strawberry vines, will continue to emerge amongst wedding flower trends for 2026.

"Couples are embracing greenery in ways that reflect their individual tastes—some opting for all-greenery weddings with lush, textured foliage, while others use greenery more sparingly as an accent in the ceremony or reception," says Smith. "What's particularly interesting this year is how greenery isn't limited to foliage alone. Many couples are introducing verdant tones through green flowers as well, incorporating statement blooms such as hydrangeas, viburnum, allium, and orchids. The result is a fresh, organic aesthetic that feels both sophisticated and deeply connected to nature."

Freihoff notes that he's seeing a resurgence in cascading bouquets à la Princess Diana. This bouquet shape feels lush and effortless, but 2026 reveals a new adjective to describe these trendy bridal and wedding bouquets: delicate. Thin tendrils and vines will trail down from the central bundle, resulting in a more piecey, modern silhouette than in decades past. We're also keeping an eye out for the return of the vintage ribbon cascade, where individual blossoms are tied to a thin ribbon designed to hang down from the bouquet.

Yes, wedding bouquets are the most prominent accessory a marrier will carry on their wedding day, but the world of wedding bouquet trends is seeing the rise of a hybrid model that combines a traditional bouquet with everyone's most-carried daily accessory. Purse-style or otherwise-handled bouquets are emerging as cheeky, yet functional takes on the classic bunch of blossoms.

Some iterations of this trend feel sculptural and high fashion, bedecked with pearl handles and other eye-catching adornments. Others are molded entirely out of botanical elements, so they appear like a purse a woodland sprite might carry in a fantasy realm. On the notion of fantasy taking hold in florals, Freihoff says: "I've seen a huge influx of people looking for some escapism. They look for a way to feel inside a fairytale or being part of a universe."

## 12\. Grounded Ceremony Arches

Instead of spanning overhead or framing a view behind, wedding arches were more down to earth (literally) in 2025 and they're continuing to be a hallmark of contemporary wedding flowers and 2026 floral trends. Think of them roughly as if a traditional wedding arch was placed on its back and the couple stood in between its sides to say "I do." Though, grounded arches typically take a more circular shape (rather than arched) and include blossoms of varying heights that look as if they're sprouting from the ground as they partially embrace the couple. 

"We're continuing on with the absence of traditional overhead arches (unless for religious purposes, such as mandap or chuppah)," said Lorinda Constant, owner of and lead floral designer at [Sweet Talk Floral](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/sweet-talk-floral-providence-ri-1101335) in Providence, Rhode Island, of the trend last year. "Clients are favoring 'growing' ground arches in a more natural style, like they're standing in a garden at the altar."

Chloe Kweon of [à la Chloe Event Design](https://www.alachloe.com/) in Seattle, Washington, also anticipated this trend taking off last year (especially with wispy wildflowers and grasses) as florals get a little more free form: "I foresee a strong trend toward more organic shapes and natural looks," says the pro. "Meadow-style ground arches with full aisle decor are becoming increasingly popular, creating a soft, romantic atmosphere."

## 13\. Small Bouquets All Around

Lush, oversized wedding bouquets have been the norm for a few years, but wedding bouquet trends for 2026 signal bunches are leaning small, micro even—some as petite as a single stem. This goes for all members of the wedding party, not just the main marriers. And though these bouquets are smaller, they still pack a punch with texture and stray away from the cookie cutter. 

"Bouquets have been trending smaller over the past few years and we expect this to continue through 2026," says Smith. "We've been seeing a growing trend toward single-element bridesmaid bouquet styling. Some clients choose one signature bloom to feature across all the bridesmaids' bouquets, while others opt for different, yet coordinating, flowers for each bridesmaid for a varied look."
