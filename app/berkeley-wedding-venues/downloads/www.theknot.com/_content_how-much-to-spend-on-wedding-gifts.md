## **How to Budget an Appropriate Wedding Gift Amount**

To determine how much to give as a wedding gift, it's best to estimate what you're comfortable spending on the overall event. Between prewedding parties, travel accommodations and your outfit(s), the cost of being a wedding guest adds up. Factor in the price of a wedding present and that amount increases, especially if you have more than one friend or family member tying the knot in a season. 

FEATURED VIDEO FROM THE KNOT

Budgeting for a wedding gift can be difficult, as there isn't one go-to price that works for everyone. The amount you spend on a wedding gift depends on a variety of factors, like your financial status. "The magic number for how much you should spend on a wedding gift depends on what fits your budget," says Lizzie Post, Co-President of [The Emily Post Institute](https://emilypost.com/). "You should give a gift that's worth what you can afford to give comfortably."

Hopefully, this expert advice will provide clarity (and perhaps a little relief). It's also worth noting that many traditional gifting rules are no longer relevant. "The amount of your gift does not have to [cover your 'head' or 'plate](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-gift-etiquette-cover-plate-rule),' which is a common misconception," Post explains. "Guests shouldn't even know how much their seat costs at a wedding. Your gift amount also does not have to be influenced by what the couple may have given you as a wedding gift either." Lastly, the formality of the event shouldn't impact how much to give for a wedding gift. "Just because you get invited to a formal event doesn't mean you can suddenly afford a gift at a higher price range," Post adds. "It always goes back to what you can comfortably afford."

## **The Average Wedding Gift Amount**

What is the average wedding gift amount that people give? According to The Knot 2024 Guest Study, guests spent an average of $150 on a wedding gift in 2024, (the same amount as 2023). The survey also found that the closer a guest was to the couple, the more they would spend. While this data is a helpful starting point, it's really up to you to settle on an appropriate wedding gift amount.

## **How Much to Give for a Wedding Gift**

Deciding how much to spend on wedding gifts for friends, family members or co-workers can be a minefield, but we're here to help. Below, we break down five scenarios to help you find a number to fit your budget and the couple you're buying for.

### **Wedding Gift Amount for Close Family and Friends**

Your BFF is getting married! You've been dreaming about this day for years, and now it's time to get their wedding gift. Based on our insights, guests spent an average of $160 on wedding gifts for close friends and family. That wedding gift amount was also the same if guests were members of the wedding party. 

Before you decide how much to spend on a friend's wedding gift, consider the total amount you've already contributed to their big day. This could include what you've spent on their engagement present, shower gift, bach party and other wedding-related expenses. Remember, having a close relationship doesn't mean you need to splurge. A sentimental gift can be just as meaningful as something extravagant.

### **Wedding Gift Amount for Colleagues and Coworkers**

Need help figuring out a wedding gift amount for a coworker? Look for presents that fall between $50 and $100. If you've been working together for longer than a year, you might lean toward the higher end of this scale. Whatever the case, this amount is a good guideline for choosing [wedding gifts for your coworker](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-gift-for-coworker) or [wedding gifts for your boss](https://www.theknot.com/content/appropriate-wedding-gifts-gift-for-the-boss). And, if you're still unsure, you can always give money or a gift card. "Cash is a perfectly acceptable gift to give on its own," Post shares. "We just recommend that you give a monetary gift with a wedding card so the couple knows who it came from."

### **Wedding Gift Amount for Acquaintances**

The wedding day of an acquaintance or a distant relative is no less celebratory. While you might not be super close, you can still get them a great gift for the occasion. But what is an appropriate amount to spend on a wedding gift for acquaintances? According to our data, guests spent an average of $140 on wedding gifts for casual friends. With this in mind, we recommend browsing presents in the $75 to $175 range. Ultimately, you'll want to consider your relationship with the couple, along with your budget, to choose an appropriate gift.

### **Wedding Gift Amount Per Couple**

Perhaps you're attending a wedding as a plus-one or with a partner. Wondering if the rules about how much to spend on a wedding gift change for couples? Honestly, they don't. In this scenario, you might consider spending anywhere from $100 to over $200 on a wedding gift. "If you're attending the wedding with a significant other, you can always give a gift together," Post explains. "The gift can be structured any way you want: One person can give the gift while the other signs the card or you can chip into the gift together. Whether or not you contribute to the gift is between you and the person you're attending with, just make sure both names are on the card."

### **Wedding Gift Amount Per Family**

If a wedding invitation has been addressed to your whole family, only one gift is expected and you should budget $150 to more than $200, depending on how much you'll spend traveling to the wedding. Think of it as a group gift, even if kids won't actually contribute any money. If you have adult children who were invited on your invitation, it's their choice (and yours) if they help pay for the gift. However, if they were sent their own invitation, they should prepare to give a separate wedding gift within their budget.

### **Common Wedding Gift Amount Questions, Answered**

By now, you probably have a clearer picture of how much you should spend on a wedding present. That said, you may still have a few questions on your mind. Is $100 enough for a wedding gift? Do you even have to give a wedding gift at all? Do you buy gifts for the bridal shower _and_ the wedding? Read on to find the answers to the most common wedding gift queries.

### **Is it okay to give cash as a wedding gift?**

Both cash and traditional presents are great options when it comes to wedding gifting. As tradition has evolved, it's more common to give [money as a wedding gift](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-to-give-cash-for-wedding-gifts). (And yes, it's totally acceptable by modern etiquette standards.) In fact, some couples prefer it, which is why there's been an influx of monetary funds (like those available via [The Knot Cash Funds](https://www.theknot.com/registry)) added to registries recently. According to our data, 40% of guests who attended a wedding in 2024 gave cash for a wedding gift, compared to 50% who gave a physical gift. (The remaining 10% opted to give a gift card.) Ultimately, you can't go wrong with a wedding gift, a voucher or cash. The choice simply comes down to your personal preference. 

### **Is $100 enough money to give for a wedding?**

While clocking in a bit below the average wedding gift price, $100 is a perfectly fine amount of money to give for a wedding gift. As Post stated above, the right number depends on what you can afford. Guests are encouraged to use the average cost of a wedding gift, $150, as a starting point rather than a target.

### **Should the wedding gift amount match the price per head?**

Nowadays, using the "cover your plate" rule as a formula for how much to spend on a wedding gift is not ideal. Would you give your best friend a less expensive gift because they were having a more casual affair? Instead, use your relationship with the couple and our gift calculator to land at an appropriate wedding gift amount.

### **Should I give a gift if I can't attend the wedding?**

Here's a tricky one: How much should you spend on a wedding gift if you aren't attending the actual event? Even if you have to [RSVP "no](https://www.theknot.com/content/sending-your-regrets)," it's still recommended to send the couple a gift to thank them for inviting you. You may decline a wedding invitation for various reasons, but if the cost is a factor, it's understandable if you can't commit to a pricey gift. Regardless of your financial status, we recommend [checking the couple's registry](https://www.theknot.com/registry/couplesearch) to find ideas in your price range. Look for flexible options like gift cards, cash funds or affordable home items. You could also go in on a group gift with other guests to offset some of the costs.

### **Do I have to buy a wedding gift?**

Technically, you aren't required to give a wedding gift, but it's proper etiquette to give something. Thanks to modern registry tools, it's easier than ever to find a present that fits your budget. You can check the couple's registry for options at different price ranges, or if you prefer, contribute to a cash fund or send a check in the mail.

### **Do I give a wedding gift for a destination wedding?**

You might be tempted to skip the gift if you're traveling for a far-flung destination wedding, but according to [destination wedding gift etiquette](https://www.theknot.com/content/should-you-buy-destination-wedding-gift), you should still give the newlyweds something to celebrate. Some couples may ask guests to forgo a gift, but unless it's explicitly stated, it's better to pick out a present for the newlyweds.

### **Do I purchase gifts for multiple wedding events?**

While etiquette rules are a bit looser around wedding gifts, they're stricter when attending a wedding shower. If you're invited to both the shower and wedding day, bank on buying a gift for each event. So, what's the difference? "A wedding shower is the one event where a gift is required because the entire event revolves around giving gifts to the couple," Post says. "If you're ever not sure whether a gift is necessary, check with the host to find out what's expected."

Giving a shower gift and a wedding present can be expensive, which is why budgeting is important. Plan ahead where you can, so your total budget covers shower and wedding gifts, along with small presents for the engagement or bachelorette parties. Remember: You don't have to spend an equal amount on gifts for the shower and the wedding; it's fine to give a little more to one event and less to the other.

## **The Knot Wedding Gift Amount Calculator**

It can be tricky to establish how much to spend on a wedding gift. Fortunately, we're here to help. Answer a few simple questions below and our gift calculator will suggest how much you should shell out for the newlyweds.
