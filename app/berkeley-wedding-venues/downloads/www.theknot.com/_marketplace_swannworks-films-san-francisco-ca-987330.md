Great communication, booking process, and clear expectations for videography services. I booked Swannworks Films after working with Keida for previous weddings that I have coordin...

ated as a wedding planner. When we were limited to a smaller guest count for our wedding due to capacity limitations during the pandemic, we decided to live stream our wedding ceremony for our guests that could not attend. Keida assisted with setting up the viewing platform on YouTube so that's our guests from out of state and even from other countries could tune in. We were given the link in advance so that it can be easily communicated to our guests. From the feedback that we received from our family and friends, the quality of the video and live stream was great, and they were so happy to be able to have tuned in to our wedding even in the midst of the pandemic. He was very clear with setting the right expectations from the beginning of our interaction during booking, and also professional and friendly on the wedding day. We were thankful that Keida captured our day and made it all possible for our loved ones to be able to join. Thank you Keida! We would recommend Swannworks Films if you're thinking of hiring a live stream wedding video or videography services for your wedding day!

My now husband and I had to change our wedding plans during the national pandemic. This included booking all new vendors, one of which happened to be Keida. Beyond his work ethic...

and professionalism, Keida was an absolute pleasure to work with. His ability to capture and create a video with unique, tender and intimate moments during a wedding is truly incredible. We had all of our family and friends in tears again just from watching his highlight real of our wedding because of the heartfelt memories Keida captured. He was so easy and fun to work with you never felt for a second that you were being recorded! Do yourself a favor and look no further...you wont regret working with Keida!!

We booked Keida to be our videographer for our wedding in May 2019, and we were very pleased with our decision! Keida was extremely professional and fun to work with. He used multi...

ple cameras to capture different angles during the ceremony, and even used a drone to get incredible aerial footage of our venue. He also surprised us with a short teaser video of our first look while we were on our honeymoon! I highly recommend Keida if you are looking for a videographer. You will not be disappointed!

I couldn't have asked for a better experience than the one I had with Swannworks at our wedding. Keida got there early so he could scope out the grounds, and this allowed him to ge...

t shots of the entire venue for our footage (200 acres!!). He was very kind and easy to work with. He kept things organized throughout the chaos of the day, and an added bonus - he was a ton of fun and got along with our photographer, band and our guests! If you want good energy around you on your big day and high quality videography, I highly recommend Swannworks!!

ad follow up questions he was able to speak with me or answer them instantly. Keida truly went over and beyond not only for our wedding but for our rehearsal dinner that we also hired him for. Keida communicated with us through the post process as he was completing our videos and made sure we were 100% happy with the videos before he completed them! He is a professional that is going to do whatever it takes to make sure his final product is nothing less than perfection for his clients. Which was exactly what he did for us! I can't wait to hire Keida again for another event we want to capture the moment!

Keida of Swannworks Films was absolutely wonderful to work with! From the very first email he was responsive and attentive. On the day of the actual event he was on time, friendly,...

helpful and a calming energy that was very much appreciated! Afterwards he truly captured the essence of the day! He caught moments we weren't expecting to see and all of the little details of the day. He kept us informed of when we would could expect the video and even gave us great suggestions on the song. He is so creative and will make you want to get married all over again when you watch the video! Thank you Swannworks Films!

y making himself available by phone or email anytime i had questions. He is very professional yet friendly and understands how important this role is. The day of, he had three cameras rolling so needless to say, he was able to get some amazing footage!! He sent us a sneak peek literally just a week after our wedding that we were able to share with our friends and family and we received such great feedback from all of them. I must've watched it about a million times!! He just knows exactly what to do with all the footage and editing, even picking the background music, although you are able to choose your own, he choose ours for our ceremony footage and it was sooo spot on! I got teary eyed watching it. I highly, highly recommend Keida at Swannwork Films for wedding videography. I really think his work speaks for itself. So happy we chose him.

Keida was hands down, the BEST vendor I had for my entire wedding! He was the easiest to work with, most laid back, and friendliest vendor! My wedding was on Friday, so I haven't g...

otten my video back yet. But Keida was able to make me feel very comfortable with booking him by email. This was a destination wedding for us and I wasn't able to meet any of my vendors until the day before the wedding. Keida always kept me in the loop all day. He showed up to video while we were getting ready and stayed all day with us. Our video booth was unable to be set up due to wind at our venue, but Keida quickly came up with an alternative to be able to have my guests give us well wishes for our marriage! We're having a reception back home in September and Keida was very accommodating and said he will be able to get the video back several weeks beforehand in case we wanted him to make any tweaks to it. If you're looking for a videographer, I would highly recommend Keida!
