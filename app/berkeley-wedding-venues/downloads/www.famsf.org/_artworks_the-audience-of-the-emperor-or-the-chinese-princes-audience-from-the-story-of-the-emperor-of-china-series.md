  * From the Exotic to the Mystical: May 4, 2013 - August 4, 2013:This work belongs to a series of ten French Chinoiserie tapestries depicting a Chinese monarch (probably K'angxi [r. 1654-1722]) engaged in peaceful, scholarly pursuits. Instead of traveling to the East, the artists relied on Jesuit missionary and traveler accounts such as Johan Nieuhof's 1665 illustrated treaty. True reverence is shown for the emperor, who sits like an idol surrounded by guards, European courtiers, and exotic animals such as the elephant, griffon, sphinx, and peacock. So popular was this series that the design template, or cartoon, was worn out by 1732.
