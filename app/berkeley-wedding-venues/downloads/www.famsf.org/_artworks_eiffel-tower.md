  * ###  Transcript 

Narrator: The Eiffel Tower in Paris – then the tallest human-made structure in the world – was almost completed when Georges Seurat made this painting in 1889. Chief Curator Emily Beeny:

Emily Beeny: _Seurat gives us an image of the tower in the process of becoming, not yet fully constructed, and in a way dissolving into Seurat’s signature network of dots and dashes of color._

Narrator: Seurat was fascinated by modern scientific discoveries about how the eyes and brain process color. But he was also drawn to the timelessness of art of the past. As were a group of prominent French artists and writers, who saw the Eiffel Tower as the triumph of engineering over artistry. And perhaps Seurat’s painting, too, contains a sense of ambivalence.

Emily Beeny: _It's totally possible to see it as a celebration of this extraordinary achievement of modernity. And yet we watch it, even as it's being built, seem somehow to evaporate into constituent points of color and light_.

Narrator: The Eiffel Tower was built for the 1889 World’s Fair. Feel free to explore other paintings in the gallery as you keep listening, to hear some recent discoveries about its connections with French colonial history.

Emily Beeny: _The financing of the Eiffel Tower was secured through a private bank that was making most of its income off of the sovereign debt of Haiti._

Narrator: Haiti was a French colony until its enslaved people overthrew their brutal rulers in 1804 to gain their freedom. The French then demanded extortionate reparation money to compensate its former enslavers for their loss. They continued to treat generations of Haitian people as commodities. Soon, French banks saw a lucrative opening. 

Emily Beeny: _And so this French bank that funds the construction of the Eiffel Tower is lending on a very predatory basis to Haiti, in order to allow Haiti to pay back its debt to France. This is a monument that sits in the middle of a World's Fair that is in many ways all about the declaration of French supremacy, the display of France's growing colonial power and international reach._  





The inventor of the so-called Neo-Impressionist, or pointillist, technique, Seurat used tiny dots of bright, contrasting color to evoke form and light. His technique drew on contemporary theories of visual perception, seeking to give painting a new structure and scientific grounding. Here his subject was the famous tower built by Gustave Eiffel in 1889 for the Universal Exposition in Paris. Seurat portrayed the structure prior to its completion in the summer of 1889. The top, still missing its distinctive crowning platform, seems to dissolve into the sky.
