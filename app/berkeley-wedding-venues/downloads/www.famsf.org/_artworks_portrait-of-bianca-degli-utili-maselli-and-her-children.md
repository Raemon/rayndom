  * ###  Transcript 

Narrator: Bianca Maselli was a noblewoman living in Rome in 1604, when this extraordinary portrait was painted. Chief Curator Emily Beeny: 

Emily Beeny: _And she's portrayed with six of her nineteen children, at the age of probably about thirty-six or thirty-seven. We don't know the names of all of the children represented, though we do know the name of the little toddler who clings to her mother's index finger and then holds the puppy's paw very tenderly - that's Virginia Maselli_. 

Narrator: These may be the only six of Bianca’s nineteen children to survive at this point. 

Emily Beeny: _My favorite passage in the picture is the three little boys at right, who really seem to be up to something!_

Narrator: One holds a quill pen and inkwell – perhaps indicating his studious nature. And the little dog symbolizes faithfulness. 

Emily Beeny: _Many women wished to have a portraitist underscore the virtue of fidelity as chief among their wifely achievements_. 

Narrator: The portrait is by Lavinia Fontana, who, like most women artists at this time, trained in her father’s studio. 

Emily Beeny: _She's especially good at portraying rich sumptuous textiles, as you can see here in all that amazing sort of velvet, brocade and silk and handmade lace, and also very good at jewelry_. 

Narrator: Fontana built a successful career while raising eleven children, partly because her husband gave up his own artistic practice to help run her studio. 

Emily Beeny: _Their marriage contract stipulates that her artistic career is to continue after their wedding and that she is going to be exempted from normal household duties in order to pursue her art. It's vanishingly rare, breathtakingly rare, but one understands how essential it was to get that down in writing, in order to secure what was at that time a really unusual privilege for a woman_.  





Lavinia Fontana was renowned both for her rich depictions of costumes and jewelry and for her sympathetic portrayals of women and children. Here the Roman noblewoman Bianca degli Utili Maselli appears with five of her sons and one daughter: the toddler clutching her forefinger. Dressed in blinding splendor—lace and silk, diamonds and pearls—each member of the family holds an accessory: a cup of figs, a pen and inkwell, a puppy, and so on. These surely carried emblematic meanings linked to the virtues of individual sitters: sweetness, studiousness, fidelity, etc. Bianca bore nineteen children before her premature death. Those portrayed here were probably the six still living by 1605. This painting is the first work of art created by a woman before 1700 to join the collection of the Legion of Honor.
