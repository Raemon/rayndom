Neo-Impressionist painter Paul Signac extended his explorations of color into lithography in the 1890s. His color theory was based on the relationship between light and color, and Signac believed that an artist could find an optical harmony by juxtaposing pure, complementary colors applied directly onto the canvas, without mixing them with other colors. Because color lithography involved layering individual colors on paper from separately inked stones, the printing process suited Signac’s chromatic experimentation. Untrained in the complexities of lithography, he worked closely with printer Auguste Clot, who assisted and guided him in the materialization of his theory in print.
