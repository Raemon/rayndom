#  Conditions for artwork reproduction 

  1. Reproduction is permitted only from photographic material supplied by the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco. Reproduction from printed or other non-photographic materials not supplied by the Museums is strictly prohibited.  

  2. Permission is granted for only one usage in one publication, one edition, and in one language. Additional language editions and subsequent revised new editions will be considered upon application.  

  3. Full documentation and ownership credit, as specified by the Museums, must appear either directly under the reproduction, on the page facing, on the reverse, or in the illustration credit section. Full documentation consists of the artist’s name, title of work of art, date, medium, and size. In addition to FINE ARTS MUSEUMS OF SAN FRANCISCO, the credit line must include the donor’s name when indicated.  
  
In the case of books with reproductions bound within text: if the Museums’ reproductions are the only ones in this publication, with captions in one of the above stated locations, then you may list only the artist’s name, title of work of art, and date. However, the complete ownership documentation must appear elsewhere within the book, such as in an index or list of illustrations.  
  
In the case of films, videos, and filmstrips: if it is not stated on the adjacent frame, this information must appear in the accompanying manual.  
  

  4. If an art object is not reproduced in its entirety, that is, if it is cropped in any way, the caption must include the word “detail.” The work of art is to be reproduced without “bleeding,” alteration, or overprinting of any kind. Reproductions may not be printed on color stock.  

  5. Applicants may be asked to submit color proofs in advance of publication.  

  6. Special permission is required if the reproduction is to appear as a frontispiece, chapter divider, book cover / dust jacket, calendar, poster, or individual reproduction, or if it is not referred to directly in the text. In such cases, an additional fee is payable. The final layout must be submitted before production for approval by the Museums.  

  7. Immediately upon publication, one copy shall be sent to the Rights and Reproductions team and shall become the property of the Museums.  

  8. The permission hereby granted terminates immediately upon publication.  
  

  9. Copyright for the requested image(s) may be in question. Our fees relate to usage and handling. Copyrights are generally retained by the artists. Permission to use art not in the public domain must be secured by you through the artist or their agents.
