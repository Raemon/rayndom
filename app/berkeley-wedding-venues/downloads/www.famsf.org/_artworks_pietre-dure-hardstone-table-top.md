  * ###  Transcript 

Narrator: If you were a British aristocrat in the 18th or 19th century, your art collections were designed to display your wealth, taste and superior education. And a sense that, with the growth of the British empire, the world was at your fingertips.

Collections often included paintings and antique sculptures purchased while traveling in Italy. Gemstones and minerals added an element of science. Made around 1800, this Italian table combines a little of each category. Using techniques dating back to antiquity, valuable hardstones are combined with extraordinary artisanship into a patterned mosaic, set into white marble. Curator Jeffrey Fraiman:

Fraiman: _Though made over 200 years ago, there's something remarkably fresh and abstract about this work._ _Everything was carefully planned beforehand - the placement of every single stone, every single color, the symmetry, the visual effects of the rhythm of placement of the stones across the tabletop_. 

 _Part of the delight of these tables would be learned connoisseurs looking at them and contemplating the different stones - where they came from, how precious, how rare they were._ _The stones here were sourced from all over the globe, including places like Egypt, Afghanistan, Greece, Germany, and parts of Italy itself._

Narrator: Behind the façade of splendor created by pieces like this, often lay ominous circumstances. A few years after it was made, this table was purchased by Lord Stewart, later Lord Londonderry, who became infamous for his cruel repression of the Irish people, especially during the Great Famine of the 1840s.   





This tabletop is one of the most extraordinary examples of hardstone mosaic produced in Italy around 1800, likely by the period’s leading mosaicist, Giacomo Raffaelli. The tradition of cutting highly colored, figured hardstones to form mosaics can be traced to antiquity, but Raffaelli introduced a fresh approach by organizing carefully arrayed geometric patterns against a white marble ground. Made in Milan with a variety of precious stones that were sourced in nearby Brescia, Sicily, and Tuscany, as well as farther afield in Afghanistan, Egypt, Greece, Poland, and Russia, this table reflects the growing scientific fields of geology and gemology, as well as the global dimension of European decorative arts. The rarefied nature of materials used to make the mosaic reflected the urbane, sophisticated tastes of its patrons, which, for Raffaelli, included tsars, kings, and emperors. In the early nineteenth century, this table was acquired by Charles William Vane (1778–1854), Lord Stewart, then British ambassador in Vienna. Stewart, later Lord Londonderry, was infamously known for his repression of the 1798 Irish uprising and a callousness towards the Irish during the potato famine. This tabletop owes its name to its documented presence in Stewart’s London mansion, Londonderry House, and remained by descent in the family until 2014. Jeffrey Fraiman in Gifts of Art (2025), p. 104.

  * ###  Provenance 

Lord Charles William Vane (1778–1854), 3rd Marquess of Londonderry, Holdernesse House, London, by 1834; [1] [2]

By descent to Alistair Vane-Tempest-Stewart (1937–2012), 9th Marquess of Londonderry, Richmond, UK; [3] [4]

Sold, Christie’s, London, July 10, 2014, lot 1; 

[Purchased by Galerie G. Sarti, Paris];

Sold to the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, 2023

[1] Listed in the Holdernesse House inventory, March 21, 1834, as “a mosaic centre table on gilt stand.” In the Holdernesse House inventory of 1857, it is described as “a carved and gilt table on 4 legs and crop rails with statuary top beautifully inlaid with specimens of fancy marbles, agates and other stones. Size of top 5 ft 10 by 2 ft 11.” Marginal annotations describe the condition of the table: “gilding bad state” and “marble edges chipped.” See Durham County Record Office, Londonderry Estates, D/Lo/E 781 & D/Lo/E 991.

[2] He almost certainly acquired the table top while serving as the British Ambassador to the Viennese Court (1814–1822). He may have acquired the table top directly from Giacomo Raffaelli, who opened a small exhibition of his lapidary works and mosaics in Vienna between 1818 and 1819, on the occasion of his marriage to Frances Anne Vane Tempest (1800-1865), as suggested in an unpublished essay by Anna Maria Massinelli, 2024, curatorial file, Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco.

[3] Included in the Londonderry House inventory, 1939, under “Yellow Drawing Room… with a thick white marble slab elaborately inlaid with numerous panels, medallions and borders, with a unique collection of marbles and semi-precious stones…” Cited in Christie’s, 2014, p.8. This table is photographed around 1937, in Oswald, “Great London Mansions, Londonderry House Park Lane,” p. 39, showing it was still on the gilt stand. It is unclear what date the stand was separated from the table top.

[4] Listed in the 2014 Christie’s auction catalogue as the property of the late 9th Marquess of Londonderry, sold by order of the Executors.
