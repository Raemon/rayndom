##  Rental FAQ 

  * ###  Does the rental fee include food, beverage, or staff? 

The rental fees listed include museum staff, such as an engineer, some custodial services, a museum representative, and security. No food, beverage, or service staff is included in rental fees.

  * ###  How can we see the spaces that are available for rent? 

Discovery calls are required prior to scheduling a site visit with a Rental Events team member. To schedule a discovery call, please complete the [Rental Events inquiry form](/about/rent-the-museums/rental-event-inquiry-form). Site visits can be scheduled with the Rental Events team Tuesday – Friday, 9:30 am – 4:30 pm. You can also visit many of our event areas during business hours without an appointment or ticket. Stop by at your convenience to see if the spaces fit your needs. The museums are open Tuesday – Sunday, 9:30 am – 5:15 pm. Please note that the de Young’s Hamon Observation Tower closes at 4:30 pm.

  * ###  How can we check availability or hold a potential date? 

Please complete the [Rental Events inquiry form](/about/rent-the-museums/rental-event-inquiry-form) and our team will get back to you with availability. You may place a hold on a date if it is open. Holds are valid for 30 days.

  * ###  What if there is a hold on the date we want? 

We allow two holds for any given date. If you are interested in a date with one tentative hold, you can place a second hold. If you are interested in a date that has two tentative holds, you must challenge the holding parties in order to secure your date.

  * ###  How do we challenge a hold? 

In order to challenge a hold, you must sign the challenge waiver and submit 50% of your estimated rental fees. Once this payment has been received by the Rental Events team, the holding party(ies) will have 48 hours to book the space or lose their hold. By challenging a hold, you are committing to going to contract for that specific date.

  * ###  What if our hold is challenged by another party? 

If your hold is challenged, the Rental Events team will give you notice via email that you have been challenged. You can release your hold or, to book your date, you can go to contract and submit a 50% rental deposit within 48 hours.

  * ###  What is the earliest start time for an event? 

In general, the de Young and Legion of Honor are available beginning each evening at 6:30 pm. On Mondays, events may start earlier, as the museum is closed. Daytime events can be booked in the Piazzoni Mural Room and Koret Auditorium at the de Young Museum and the Gunn Theater at the Legion of Honor.

  * ###  What is the latest time an event can run? 

The latest an event can run is 1 am.

  * ###  What if our guests arrive early? 

Please reach out to the Rentals Events team to discuss the specifics, but generally, the museum doors open to guests at the contracted event start time.

  * ###  Can we rent any spaces for less than four hours? 

All rental fees are based on a four-hour event; however, you do not need to use all four hours if your event is shorter.

  * ###  What is the policy for using outside caterers? 

Only caterers listed on the approved caterers list (see above) are permitted to cater on-site at the museum. No other caterers are permitted.

  * ###  What are the restrictions with regard to decoration, music, and entertainment? 

Due to our art collections, there are some restrictions on decor in the building. Our comprehensive policies and procedures will be included with your contract. You can request an electronic version prior to contract by emailing the Rental Events team.

  * ###  Does the museum provide any event supplies? 

No, the museum doesn’t provide any equipment for events.

  * ###  May I use the de Young or Legion of Honor for fundraising, religious, political, or gambling events, or events for guests under 21? 

None of the above are permitted at the de Young museum or Legion of Honor.
