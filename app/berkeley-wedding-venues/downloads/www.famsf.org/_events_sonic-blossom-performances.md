Select weekdays + weekends  
Weekdays 1–4 pm + weekends 11 am–5 pm 

In _Sonic Blossom_ , a singer approaches visitors to offer the gift of a song selected from the Schubert lieder (songs written for one voice). Lee Mingwei listened to this music with his mother while caring for her after heart surgery in 2012. If a visitor accepts this offer of beauty and solace, the singer then serenades them.

This ongoing participatory performance is part of the exhibition __[_Lee Mingwei: Rituals of Care_](/exhibitions/lee-mingwei).
