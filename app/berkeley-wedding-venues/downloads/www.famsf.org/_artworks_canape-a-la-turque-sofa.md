  * ###  Transcript 

Narrator: Originally made for Queen Marie Antoinette – later executed during the French Revolution – this sofa dates from happier days for the queen, when she lived at the magnificent palace of Versailles. 

Around 1779, Marie Antoinette ordered this “Turkish sofa” or daybed, for her private salon, or sitting room. Unlike the stiff, upright seating of previous generations, the latest furnishings offered seductive comfort, opulence and luxury. Europeans ascribed these attributes to “Turkish” style. The sofa’s wooden frame features flowers. They symbolize springtime and perhaps the mood of twenty-four-year old Marie Antoinette, who’d finally given birth to a daughter and hoped for a son.

In the end, the sofa was used elsewhere in the palace. But its recent restoration, complete with embroidered spring flowers, transforms it into something we can imagine gracing the queen’s lavish salon. A lady-in-waiting described a Sunday morning at Versailles:

Character voice (woman): A few minutes before midday, the ladies entered the salon - at least forty people. We were very closely packed for our hooped skirts took up a great deal of room. As soon as the queen had greeted each of us, we stood to the right and left so she could pass on her way to Mass. The queen showed herself a little jealous of those young ladies who could bring to the hard light of noon, a complexion more dazzling than her own. I was one of them. And once when she was passing through the door, a duchess whispered in my ear, do not stand facing the windows. However, the queen was usually very kind to me.
