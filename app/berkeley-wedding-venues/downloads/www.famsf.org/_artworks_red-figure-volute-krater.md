Narrator: Vases this shape usually held wine and water. But this one was made as a very impressive funeral monument. The scene on the front illustrates a key moment in the story of the war between Greece and Troy, located in modern-day Turkey.

In the center sits the Greek warrior Achilles. His comrade Patroclus has been killed by Hector and his Trojan army. Suddenly, Iris, winged messenger of the gods, flies in. She urges Achilles to reenter the battle - and recover his comrade’s body. Here’s theater director and playwright Carey Perloff, with the story as told by Homer in his epic poem, The Iliad:

Perloff: “ _Halting near, she gave Achilles a flight of marching orders: “To arms! Defend Patroclus - It's all for him, this merciless battle pitched before the ships_. _Up with you - no more lying low! Writhe with shame at the thought - Patroclus may be sport for the dogs of Troy! Yours, the shame will be yours if your comrade’s corpse goes down to the dead, defiled!”_

Narrator: After this scene, Achilles plunges back into battle, rescuing his friend’s body. 

Perloff: _These poems were read and sung and performed_.  _All of Greek tragedy comes from the Iliad and the Odyssey, from the Trojan War stories, and in particular from these incredible character studies of complicated, flawed, brilliant leaders trapped in emergency situations. It's the perfect stuff of drama._

Narrator: Around on the back side of the vase, you’ll find a scene showing a warrior with armor around him in a temple-like building. No doubt, he’s the person commemorated by this funerary monument. It connects his own courage with the legendary bravery of Achilles.  





Although descended from the long-established traditional forms of vase painting of mainland Greece, vessels such as this impressive wine vessel from the Greek colony of Apulia show that red-figure vases of southern Italy differ from those of Athens. With superb creative skill the artist has captured the climactic moment described in Homer's Iliad (Book 18) when Iris, the winged messenger of the gods, has come to the sulking Achilles with news that the Trojan prince Hektor may seize the body of his fallen friend Patroklos. The Greek hero is seated on a couch in his tent, leaning on his staff. The deceased in the naiskos is a popular motif for reverses on large Apulian vases. It is likely that the mythological subject on the front of this vase was chosen to connect with the funerary scene on the back—a link between the dead warrior and a Greek hero's bravery, as exemplified by Achilles.
