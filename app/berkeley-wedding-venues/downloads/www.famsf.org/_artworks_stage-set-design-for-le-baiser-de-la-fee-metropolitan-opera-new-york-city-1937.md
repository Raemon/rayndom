#  Stage set design for Le baiser de la fée (Metropolitan Opera, New York City, 1937) 

1937

[ Alice Halicka ](https://www.famsf.org/art-finder?artist=11835)

Not on view

Alice Halicka studied painting in Munich before moving to Paris in 1912, where she continued her education and became involved with the city’s avant-garde art scene. Halicka worked across mediums, from Cubist painting to costume and stage design. On several occasions, she traveled to the United States, where she designed this set for _Le baiser de la fée_ (_The Fairy’s Kiss_), a classical ballet composed by Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky. The set, which captures the architectural forms that are often present in her work, was possibly for George Balachine’s production of the ballet, which premiered in New York City in 1937.
