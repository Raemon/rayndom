##  Auxiliaries of the Fine Arts Museums 

Consisting of five membership groups, the Auxiliaries raise funds that support the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco’s goals. This includes the coordination of Bouquets to Art, one of the Museums’ largest annual fundraisers, in addition to smaller initiatives and social gatherings throughout the year.

### **San Francisco Auxiliary of the Fine Arts Museums**

The San Francisco Auxiliary of the Fine Arts Museums was founded in 1941 by Helen de Young Cameron, with the clear purpose of raising funds for the de Young and Legion of Honor. Although we are called the San Francisco Auxiliary, there is no requirement that one must live in San Francisco. In fact, members live throughout the Bay Area. 

Every year, the San Francisco Auxiliary produces [Bouquets to Art](/giving/bouquets-to-art), one of the Museums’ most cherished and successful annual fundraising events. During its one-week run, Bouquets to Art draws tens of thousands of visitors to the de Young to view the more than 100 floral installations inspired by artworks in the permanent collection. 

Through this event, the San Francisco Auxiliary has donated more than $7.5 million to the Museums, which has helped fund special exhibitions, conservation projects, and educational programs. To learn more about this event, watch [_What is Bouquets to Art?_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9L5AGsEFIA)_,_ featuring FAMSF Docent Maureen Murray Fox. 

Members of the San Francisco Auxiliary make financial and time commitments to Bouquets to Art. They bring their special talents to the various elements of producing and publicizing the event and enjoy special perks in the process. General meetings allow for behind-the-scenes opportunities, including lectures by museum curators and private docent-led tours of special exhibitions. In addition, and as a thank-you for the Auxiliary’s support, the Museums invite members to attend opening-night events for some of the hottest special exhibitions. 

### **Suburban Auxiliaries: Belvedere-Tiburon, East Bay, Hillsborough, and Ross**

The Suburban Auxiliaries range in size from 50 to 140 members, with members who reside in specific geographic areas. These groups support museum activities by volunteering during Bouquets to Art, underwriting lectures, and making independent donations to the Education department and other museum programs. Each of the Suburban Auxiliaries has its own requirements for membership, but all share the mission of supporting the Museums’ goals. Requirements for membership include maintaining a current membership in the Museums, attending business meetings, and paying dues to the respective Auxiliary in the amount of $75 to $175 annually. The Suburban Auxiliaries meet throughout the year to participate in docent tours at the Museums, tours of private art collections, luncheons, presentations, and more. 

To learn more about becoming a member in any of the Auxiliaries, please email us at [sffamauxiliaryinfo@gmail.com](mailto:sffamauxiliaryinfo@gmail.com). We look forward to hearing from you.
