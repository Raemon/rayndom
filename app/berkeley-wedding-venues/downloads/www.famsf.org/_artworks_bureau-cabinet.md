  * ###  Transcript 

Narrator: Without its surface designs, this would be a useful but unremarkable English desk. Its colorful decorations make it extraordinary - and tell some interesting stories about the 18th century European fascination with Chinese art and Asian techniques.

Wealthy Europeans saw China as an enchanting, mysterious place, buying Chinese porcelain, painted wallpapers and silks. European craftspeople quickly began producing imitation “Chinese” objects, finding it profitable to appropriate and commodify the designs and techniques of another culture for their patrons. 

The desk was given layers of red, resin-based varnish. Even though Chinese lacquer was common, the English called this “japanning” - Europeans often didn’t distinguish between different Asian cultures. However, they must have been aware of Japanese lacquer work, although Japan was then closed to most western contact. Meanwhile, the painted decorations copy Chinese designs, with figures among birds, trees and rocks.

Unlike most 18th century English people, architect Sir William Chambers actually visited China, and published a book describing what he’d seen. His comments on Chinese gardens resonate with the desk’s designs, even though they’re a distant echo of the real thing:

Character voice (male): The Chinese collect all kinds of extraordinary trees, plants, and flowers, and different sorts of fantastical birds and animals. You are struck with the view of a delicious landscape, enriched with everything that luxuriant nature affords most beautiful.
