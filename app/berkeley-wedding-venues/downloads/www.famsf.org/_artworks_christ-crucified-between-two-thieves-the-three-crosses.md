#  Christ Crucified Between Two Thieves (The Three Crosses) 

1653

[ Rembrandt van Rijn ](https://www.famsf.org/art-finder?artist=69)

Religious themes were of interest to Rembrandt throughout his prolific and successful career. Conceived on the scale of a painting, this print illustrates Christ's death on the Cross. A standard biblical subject, it had never been depicted with such graphic intensity or raw expressive force. Massive beams of supernatural light slice through the darkness and focus on the pitiable figure of Christ, one of the flanking thieves, and a small, central portion of the surrounding bystanders, while dark shadows fill the remainder of the scene. Rembrandt made several versions of this print, drastically reworking the surface to transform the composition when the plate had worn down through printing. The most dramatic changes occurred between the third and fourth states, when this impactful painterly work was created. New figures, including the mounted soldiers, were added; the deep lines defining Christ's body were enhanced to make him appear gaunt; and heavier black was used to highlight the tiny crown of light around his head.
