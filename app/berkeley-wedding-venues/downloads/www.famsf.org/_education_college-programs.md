##  Interpretation and Outreach Associates 

Interpretation and outreach associates (IOAs) are individuals with intersecting experience and interests in art history, art practice, community organizing, education, museum studies, and more. As key museum collaborators, the associates participate in a rigorous 10 week training program that includes readings, discussions, and workshops on museum education, interpretation, and programming with Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco staff and leading practitioners in the field. Associates engage visitors with the Museums’ collections through in-gallery conversations with a critical, inclusive, and people-centered approach.

##  Internships 

We offer paid internships to emerging professionals — undergraduate, graduate students, or recent graduates — who are interested in art and museum careers. Interns work directly with museum staff to support departmental goals and on individual projects that support their personal and professional goals. Interns participate in training sessions, professional development, and talks from leaders in the field. They gain knowledge of museum careers and culture, receive mentorship from full-time museum staff, receive hands-on project experience and feedback, and join a network of emerging museum professionals.

Our summer internship program is on hiatus for 2026. We are not accepting applications at this time.
