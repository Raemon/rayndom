#  Stage set design for Le coq d'or (Théâtre National de l'Opéra, Paris, 1914) 

1914

[ Natalia Sergeevna Goncharova ](https://www.famsf.org/art-finder?artist=225)

Not on view

A leader of the early twentieth-century Russian avant-garde in Moscow, Natalia Goncharova worked across mediums, from painting, printmaking, and book illustration to fashion and theater design. Sergei Diaghilev invited Goncharova to Paris to design the sets for the Ballets Russes’ _Le coq d’or_ (_The Golden Cockerel_) in 1914. The tremendous success of this ballet changed the course of Goncharova’s career. She returned to Paris to work with Diaghilev in 1915, and she and her partner, Mikhail Larionov, spent the remainder of their lives in Western Europe working primarily in theater design. Goncharova’s studies show the range of her imaginative designs, from colorful and fantastical themes for Le coq d’or to motifs from Russian folk culture in _L’oiseau de feu_ (_Firebird_), _La foire de Sorotchinsk_ (_The Fair at Sorotchinsk_), and _Chota Roustaveli._
