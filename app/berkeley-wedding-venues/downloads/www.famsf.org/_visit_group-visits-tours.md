We offer unique experiences for groups of all kinds. Explore our extensive permanent collections and special exhibitions, and enjoy casual or fine dining by booking a group visit.

##  What is a group? 

A group is 10 or more people. We encourage 10 or more people visiting the museum together to order tickets as a group in order to receive discounted admission rates and planning assistance. For any group visiting with chaperones, a minimum of one chaperone is required per eight youths.
