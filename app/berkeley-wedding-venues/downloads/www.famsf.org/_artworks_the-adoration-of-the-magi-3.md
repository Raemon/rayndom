  * ###  Transcript 

Isabella Lores-Chavez: _We have here a scene of the adoration of the Magi or the three Wise Men, who have come to worship the newly born Christ child._

Narrator: Curator Isabella Lores-Chavez. The Wise Men wear lavish robes and gold accessories, and bring gifts for the newborn Christ, sitting on his mother Mary’s lap.

Isabella Lores-Chavez: _One of the things that I love so much about this painting is that //we also see another figure on the right who is kneeling with his hands in prayer_. 

Narrator: That’s the wealthy Spanish patron who paid artist Rodrigo de Osona to make the painting. This was around the turn of the 1500s - when Spain was aggressively seeking to conquer territories and nations overseas. 

Isabella Lores-Chavez: _That ship in the background is really a reference to how this territorial expansion takes place through voyages that are being funded by the Spanish monarchs to the Americas._

Narrator: The Wise Man to the left, Balthazar, is shown as an African king. 

Isabella Lores-Chavez: _With this kind of territorial expansion and access to other parts of the world came the movement of people. Suddenly we have the presence of more and more Africans in Europe. That said, there had already been an African presence in Europe in the Middle Ages, partly through the kind of interconnected trade with other continents, particularly Asia and Africa._

_Depicting Balthazar as an African king is both this signal to the viewer that the kings have traveled from afar. But it's also a kind of argument for how these indigenous populations and conquered people - in the eyes of these Catholic monarchs - were supposedly amenable to being converted to Christianity._  





Medieval Christian texts described the Magi as three wise men or kings who traveled from afar to worship the newborn Jesus. In medieval European art, they were usually portrayed as white men, but by the early Renaissance, that convention changed. Rodrigo de Osona and his workshop depicted one of the Magi, Balthazar, as an African king. People from sub-Saharan Africa were already present throughout medieval Europe due to trade and diplomacy. In the fifteenth century, European enslavement of African people increased rapidly, all while the Catholic Church instrumentalized the image of Balthazar as an African king to advance its global evangelizing ambitions.
