#  A Dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) with a Tiger Moth, a Butterfly, a Snail, and a Beetle

Barbara Regina Dietzsch was one of the greatest painters of still life in early modern Europe, and the head of a productive, successful workshop in Nuremberg, Germany. She was known especially for her jewel-like gouaches focused on the simplicity and wonder of natural structures. This image of a dandelion is a testament to the artist's sensitivity to the minutest aspects of the natural world. Though the image might appear to depict one single branch of dandelion at first glance, it actually shows three separate stems, each representing a different stage of its life cycle. The dark background, a trademark of her workshop's botanical images, emphasizes the color and shape of the plant while infusing a sense of drama into the composition.
