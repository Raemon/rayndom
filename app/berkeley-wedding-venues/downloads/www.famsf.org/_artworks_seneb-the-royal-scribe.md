  * ###  Transcript 

Dreyfus: _Ancient Egyptian artists were renowned for their exceptional skill in carving wood._

Narrator: Curator in Charge of Ancient Art, Renee Dreyfus.

Dreyfus: _It was a common practice to place small, beautifully carved images that represent the deceased, in the tombs. And the man's name is Seneb_ \- _an important person in the Pharaoh's entourage._

_He's made out of nine pieces of wood so that the striated wood grain matches every curve in his body_. _And if you look carefully, his black eyes, his eyebrows, white fingernails, kilt, and the rectangular red base he's standing on are all painted - and amazingly, much of the color remains_.

Major: _It draws you in and it has its own power. That is why I love the piece, and I actually had to write to it because I felt like this was a person with a heart, with a spirit, with a mind, that was honored with this carving._

Narrator: That’s poet devorah major. Her poem about Seneb is written as if in his own voice:

Major**:** _True of voice, they said of me. Years spent learning the curve of pottery, the smoothness of limestone, the caprice of papyrus, brush strokes quick and sure._

_Some scribes worked the fields, numbering cattle and counting crops. A place for the ordinary to scratch their livings out, tabulating taxes paid and owed. An accounting of wealth they could see, but never share. Others found a military calling, writing messages of death and conquest._

_But I was a scribe of the temples, carefully reiterating spells that assured my patron an afterlife of opulence, amidst prayer. For millennia, people have recited the truth of my script, which lifted the dead, and opened eternity's doors._  





Small wooden statues representing the deceased were often placed in tombs during the period of the late Old Kingdom and into the Middle Kingdom (ca. 2400–1800 BC). This elegant statuette of the official named Seneb was carved after the powerful pharaoh Mentuhotep II (ca. 2055–2004 BC) reunified Egypt following years of political instability and famine. Mentuhotep and the succeeding kings of the Twelfth Dynasty ruled over a stable land with a centralized administration for over two hundred years while Egypt continued to prosper and the arts flourished. Seneb’s idealized sculpture was made for funerary purposes, as one of the requirements for life after death, to serve eternally as a home for his spirit. Full of vigor, directness, and power, the figure has the imposing frontal presence of a much larger statue—with left leg advanced as if walking. Painted details were delineated with care.
