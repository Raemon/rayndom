Fraiman: _The magnificent ceiling above your head is a truly special object_.

Narrator: That’s curator Jeffrey Fraiman.

Fraiman: _The ceiling comes from a palace that belonged_ _to a very important couple who were extremely close to the Spanish royal family._

Narrator: In the 1490s, the Cárdenas family built a palace just outside the Spanish capital of Toledo. Their golden ceiling has elements that reflect both their own Catholic, aristocratic background and Muslim traditions.

Family shields appear at the center of each wall panel, featuring little gold shells that continue as a border all around the ceiling. They symbolize Christ’s follower St James, who was a fisherman. Meanwhile, the ceiling’s interlocking geometric patterns are directly drawn from Islamic design. And the beautiful, ridged fan shapes at each corner resemble shells too. But they also recall the honeycomb niches of Islamic interiors.

The Spanish monarchs who governed the northern Iberian Peninsula spent centuries trying to gain control of the south from its Muslim rulers. And in 1492, right around the time this ceiling was made, the Spanish army brutally drove out the last Muslim ruler. Many Muslims were killed or expelled from the country. Those who stayed were forcibly converted to Catholicism.

The whole of Spain and its different peoples were now under the Spanish monarchs’ control. And evidently, their courtiers’ love of Islamic design was too deeply rooted to be given up.

Poet and former museum teacher devorah major:

Major: _This is a very short poem that I wrote when I was teaching in the galleries._

_15th century ceiling:_

_lost history suspended_

 _reflecting family, faith, reflecting family, faith_

 _allah intertwined with christ, allah intertwined with christ_

 _golden arcs swirl wealth, power_

 _lost history suspended._  





This imposing ceiling was once part of the Torrijos Palace, near Toledo, built in the late fifteenth century: the moment of the Catholic conquest of Spain and the first transatlantic voyages sponsored by the Spanish crown. Expert craftsmen employed a carpentry technique derived from North Africa, using interlocking sections of wood and adding color and gilding. Islamic ornament—eight-pointed stars and pseudo-Kufic inscriptions—were adapted to Spanish Gothic taste. A carved muqarnas, traditional to Islamic architecture, appears in the center, while the patrons’ coats of arms decorate four border panels, and scallop shells—the emblem of Spain’s patron saint, James the Great—adorn the corners. 

In 1905, when the palace was demolished, this ceiling was bought by an American businessman, Charles Deering, whose daughters donated it to San Francisco.
