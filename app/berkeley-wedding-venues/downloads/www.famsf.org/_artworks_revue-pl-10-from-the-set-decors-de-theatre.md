#  Revue, pl. 10 from the set, Décors de théâtre 

1930

[ Alexandra Exter ](https://www.famsf.org/art-finder?artist=11582)

Not on view

Alexandra Exter was an avant-garde painter who helped lead the transformation of the theatrical arts in Ukraine. Exter trained at the Kyiv Art Institute and in 1918 established a studio in the city with a class devoted to stage design. Her teaching had a profound impact on the next generation of theater designers, including Pavel Tchelitchew. Exter incorporates Cubist and Futurist elements in _Décors de théâtre_ (_Stage Sets_), a portfolio of color pochoirs (stencils) in which the stage and the figures become nearly abstract geometric shapes and patterns.
