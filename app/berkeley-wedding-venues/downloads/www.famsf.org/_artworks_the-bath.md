Narrator: Chief Curator Emily Beeny:

Emily Beeny: _This picture is meant to evoke the private interior of a harem - a part of the household reserved for women in various corners of the Ottoman Empire. But it is really the product of fantasy and stereotype_.

Narrator: Jean-Léon Gérôme painted the picture around 1885. He traveled widely in North Africa and the eastern Mediterranean – but would never have had access to this kind of space in reality.

Sebihi: _Upon seeing this for the first time, I do think there's an intuitive sense of discomfort - the fact that these women are in a bathhouse; there's a dark-skinned woman who is washing a seated white woman_. 

Narrator: That’s Melika Sebihi, who works in interpretation here at the Museums.

Sebihi: _I studied Middle Eastern art history in school, and I myself am North African, so I'm really interested in portrayals of the Middle East_. _A lot of portrayals were through this very colonial lens and from a viewpoint where the artist was very much othering what they were seeing._

Narrator: Orientalism refers to a movement in which, following European colonialism, western artists and writers thought about and represented the “Orient” in stereotypical, sexualized and patronizing ways.

Gerome used objects and photographs collected on his travels, to stage scenes like this in his Paris studio. And the women he portrays as bather and attendant were likely paid models from the white working-class and Black French-Caribbean communities in Paris.

Emily Beeny:  _His skill as an illusionistic painter is part of what persuaded his contemporaries of the accuracy of what is in fact a total fantasy and a studio concoction._  





Though the French artist Jean-Léon Gérôme made multiple voyages to North Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean—and painted many pictures inspired by his travels—his work draws at least as much from fantasy and stereotype as from observation. Superb technical skills allowed him to conjure the scenes he painted with a seductive realism, here evident in the treatment of wet tile, rumpled cloth, and bare skin. Relying on sketches, photographs, and props brought back from various corners of the Ottoman Empire, Gérôme painted such scenes in the comfort of his Paris studio, hiring local models to act out the roles of women in an imaginary harem.   
  
In reality, as a man and an outsider, Gérôme could never have entered a space like the one depicted here. The harem was a private area reserved for women, children, and domestic workers (whether paid or enslaved) in wealthy Ottoman households. In the nineteenth-century European imagination, however, harems formed an object of prurient curiosity and the locus of imagined Eastern otherness, defined by luxury, sensuality, and cruelty. While both figures depicted here could be free or enslaved members of a harem Gérôme's composition imposes a racialized social hierarchy (white bather vs. Black attendant) characteristic of European thinking in the period. Of course the real-life women playing both roles were likely professional models from Northern Paris, home in the later nineteenth century to significant working-class and French-Caribbean populations. Deeply informed by racist ideology and the French colonial enterprise, Gérôme's harem paintings belong to a genre known as Orientalism.
