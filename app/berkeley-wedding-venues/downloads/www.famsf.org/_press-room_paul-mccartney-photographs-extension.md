**Open until 9:30pm for Late Night Edition celebration on June 12**

 _“I’ve visited the exhibition about ten times—it offers such an intimate, behind-the-scenes view of Beatlemania. Paul’s candid photographs reveal a quiet power and emotional depth that’s both personal and historic. Seeing the world through his lens adds a whole new layer to the Beatles’ story.”_ – Jose Deniz, local artist   


SAN FRANCISCO, June 9, 2025 – For the first time on its worldwide tour, the run of _Paul McCartney Photographs 1963–64: Eyes of the Storm_ will be extended, making San Francisco’s de Young museum its continued host until October 5, 2025. Drawing over 85,000 attendees and counting in its first weeks, the exhibition has sparked tremendous enthusiasm throughout the Bay Area. 

Paul McCartney’s more than 250 personal photos, alongside video clips, and archival materials have enticed new and returning visitors to relive Beatlemania at the de Young throughout the run of the exhibition. Thousands have enjoyed the free audio tour from [Bloomberg Connects](https://guides.bloombergconnects.org/en-US/guide/fineArtsMuseumOfSanFrancisco/exhibition/71aac26a-d45b-4036-9ac3-ca08c778c14f) that features an introduction by Fine Arts Museums Director and CEO Thomas P. Campbell, an audio interview with Paul’s daughter, photographer Mary McCartney, and behind-the-scenes reflections from Paul himself.

Visitors can look forward to more fantastic programming surrounding the exhibition, including a special screening of the acclaimed documentary miniseries _McCartney 3,2,1_ on June 21st. On June 12, there will be a special opportunity to see _Paul McCartney Photographs 1963–64: Eyes of the Storm with Isaac Julien: I Dream a World_ after hours during [Late Night Editions: Isaac Julien](https://www.famsf.org/events/late-night-editions-isaac-julien). Guests can enjoy both exhibitions alongside live music, a cash bar and tasty bites for purchase from Off the Grid food trucks parked on the museum’s front lawn for the evening.

**About the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco**

The Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, comprising the de Young in Golden Gate Park and the Legion of Honor in Lincoln Park, is the largest public arts institution in San Francisco.

The de Young museum originated from the 1894 California Midwinter International Exposition in Golden Gate Park. The present copper-clad landmark building, designed by Herzog & de Meuron, opened in 2005. Reflecting an active conversation among cultures, perspectives, and time periods, the collections on view include American painting, sculpture, and decorative arts from the 17th to the 21st centuries; arts of Africa, Oceania, and the Americas; costume and textile arts; and international modern and contemporary art. 

The Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco are located on land unceded by the Ramaytush Ohlone, who are the original inhabitants of what is now the San Francisco Peninsula. The greater Bay Area is also the ancestral territory of other Ohlone peoples, as well as the Miwok, Yokuts, and Patwin. We acknowledge, recognize, and honor the Indigenous ancestors, elders, and descendants whose nations and communities have lived in the Bay Area over many generations and continue to do so today. We respect the enduring relationships that exist between Indigenous peoples and their homelands. We are committed to partnering with Indigenous communities to raise awareness of their legacy and engage with the history of the region, the impacts of genocide, and the dynamics of settler colonialism that persist today.
