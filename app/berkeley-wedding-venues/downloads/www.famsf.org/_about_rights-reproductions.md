#  Rights + reproductions 

We have more than 80,000 images of prints, drawings, paintings, textiles, and 3D artworks taken from our permanent collection. Browse the [online](https://www.famsf.org/collections) gallery, where you can search for works by artist, title, collection, or more.

### **Rights and reproductions contact**

[CIDA@famsf.org](mailto:CIDA@famsf.org)

### **Press requests**

For press requests, please visit the [Press room](https://www.famsf.org/press-releases/).

### **Product development**

For all product development questions (posters, T-shirts, mouse pads, etc.), regardless of the copyright status of an artwork, please contact the [Museum Stores](mailto:museumstores@famsf.org).

### **Personal use**

Unfortunately, we are not able to provide prints for personal use at this time. Please visit the [Museum Stores](https://www.famsf.org/shop/), where we have many posters, postcards, and note cards.

We do not provide high-resolution files for personal use at this time. Please visit the [Museum Stores](https://www.famsf.org/shop/) website to see a selection of ready-made art posters, postcards, and note cards. Those interested in producing a personal print should contact the Museum Stores.

### **Commercial or scholarly publications**

Please read our [conditions for reproduction](https://www.famsf.org/about/conditions-for-artwork-reproduction). These conditions make up the body of the licensing agreement.

Once an application is received, a member of the Rights and Reproductions team will respond in the order in which the application was received. Please anticipate 3–4 weeks for a response due to the volume of requests.

If a rush order is needed, additional rush fees are applied only if the department is able to accommodate such requests. The Rights and Reproductions team makes every attempt to adhere to requestors’ deadlines, but rush orders are not always possible due to scheduling limitations.

After an application is reviewed, a member of the department will confirm availability of an image file or if new photography is required. This follow-up includes a fee quote with pertinent copyright information, including whether additional clearance with third-party copyright holders is required. Please understand all applications incur fees to offset the costs of this service.

Once the requestor confirms that they would like to proceed with an order, an invoice and licensing agreement is prepared. After receipt of payment and a signed agreement from the requestor, a download link containing the image file is sent.

The following forms of payment are accepted: check, Visa, Mastercard, American Express, or international bank transfer.

**Sample fees:**

  * High-resolution TIFF file: $100 per image

  * New photography: $150 and up

  * Additional reproduction fees apply. Rates are dependent on the scope of the project and requestor’s commercial / nonprofit status
