  * ###  Transcript 

Narrator: Artist Peter Paul Rubens built an incredibly successful career in the seventeenth century, eventually working for royal courts around Europe. In his artistic toolkit were color, movement and emotion, which he combined brilliantly to unfold vivid stories before our eyes. 

Here, Christ, in red, is confronted by a hostile group of Pharisees. They ask, should the Jews pay taxes to their Roman overlords, or is their loyalty due to God alone? It’s a trap. Denouncing the Romans may result in his death. But Christ responds simply and calmly. He points to a coin featuring Caesar’s head, saying “Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and unto God, the things that are God’s”. 

Curator Isabella Lores-Chavez: 

Isabella Lores-Chavez: _By depicting Christ in this way, Rubens is really showing you exactly his words, translated into an image. Meanwhile, you have the reactions from the Pharisees and they’re variations on shock and even outrage. Rubens was a master draftsman, which meant that he spent so much time drawing faces and bodies and hands and feet to really understand how to capture a very individualized, very lifelike figure. And this was often done through the use of models._

Narrator: Rubens deepened his expertise in giving his work a sense of life and realism on a trip to Italy, where he studied Renaissance art and ancient classical sculpture. 

Isabella Lores-Chavez: _And I think this painting really gives us a peek into his versatility in one single composition. So yes, he's certainly a master at controlling our attention._   





Peter Paul Rubens, an exceptionally talented artist, scholar, and diplomat, forged a distinguished career at courts throughout Europe. In this early painting, his masterfully blended brushwork, brilliant colors, and expressive figures bring to life a provocative biblical passage. In an attempt to force Christ to oppose either civil or religious law, Jewish elders ask him whether they should be required to pay taxes to their occupiers, the Romans. Here, Christ displays the emperor’s image on a gold coin and gestures heavenward, declaring, “Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar’s; and unto God the things that are God’s.”
