Dreyfus: _I am Renee Dreyfus – I’m Curator in charge of Ancient Art._

_This is an anthropoid coffin of a man named Iret-hor-iru_.

_The afterlife was envisioned as a continuation of an ideal earthly existence._ _For the ancient Egyptians, they believed that the body was necessary to the survival of the spirit - it was a place to which the spirit could return to, to receive sustenance and even protection_. 

 _So it makes sense that a human-shaped coffin could function as a substitute for the mummified body within it. And in addition to that, it provides a surface for those magical images and texts that you see running down the body of the coffin._ _These texts were used to protect the deceased and assure the safe passage into this happy afterlife._

_And if we look at that unusually long inscription, it's carved with the owner's name and also a spell from the Book of the Dead, Spell 72, that guarantees the care of the deceased and his free movement in the next world. So it's really a very special coffin for a wealthy man. And at one time it was painted, and if you look carefully at the wig case, you can still see some of that paint that's on there._  





The human-shaped coffin functioned as a substitute for the mummified body, while also supplying a surface for magical images and texts to protect the deceased and assure his safe passage to the netherworld. Made from two large pieces of cedar wood for the burial of an important and wealthy individual, this beautifully carved and inscribed inner coffin presents a haunting and timeless image of a house for the mummy and its spirit. Carved into the wood with great attention to each detail, the unusually long inscription (Book of the Dead: spell 79) discloses the name of the owner of the coffin. Imported cedar was considered a luxury commodity in ancient Egypt, which had little in the way of its own wood, and care was taken to insert patches into holes next to knots in the wood. Multicolored inlays were once inserted into the glyphs and, remarkably, a few of these remain.
