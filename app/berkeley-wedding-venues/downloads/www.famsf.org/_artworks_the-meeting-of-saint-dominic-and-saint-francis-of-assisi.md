This small, refined painting depicts an encounter between the founders of the most significant monastic orders in early Renaissance Italy. Saint Dominic, wearing a black cloak and white tunic, recognizes the humble, barefoot Saint Francis from a dream in which the Virgin presented each of them to Christ. Their hands, joined in greeting, form the focal point of the composition. Fra Angelico, himself a Dominican friar, skillfully employed a convincing perspective system to describe the architecture of the church. This panel was once part of a sequence of five narrative scenes arranged along the bottom edge of a large altarpiece.
