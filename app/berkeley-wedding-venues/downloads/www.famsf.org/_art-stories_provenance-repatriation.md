Researching the provenance, or collection history, of an object is always a work in progress. When works of art are added, by purchase or gift, to the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco (FAMSF) collection, museum curators conduct provenance research. This research includes vetting information provided at the time of the acquisition, such as collection history, sale or auction records, purchase receipts, and exhibition histories, as well as undertaking new research and consultation to add to existing documentation.

For works of art already in FAMSF’s collection, we continuously work to expand on the research conducted by our predecessors. As archives become digitized worldwide, FAMSF gains access to new records and resources. We also subscribe and submit research inquiries to the [Art Loss Register](https://www.artloss.com/) (ALR), and consult with communities of origin.

FAMSF adheres to applicable ethical codes of conduct and professional practices, including those set by the [American Alliance of Museums](https://www.aam-us.org/programs/ethics-standards-and-professional-practices/code-of-ethics-for-museums/) (AAM) and the [Association of Art Museum Directors ](https://aamd.org/about/code-of-ethics#:~:text=The%20director%20will%20avoid%20any,the%20institution%20and%20the%20public.)(AAMD). We follow federal and state laws, including the [Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/101st-congress/house-bill/5237#:~:text=Native%20American%20Graves%20Protection%20and%20Repatriation%20Act%20%2D%20Provides%20for%20the,on%20Federal%20or%20tribal%20lands.) (NAGPRA), the [California Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 2001](https://nahc.ca.gov/calnagpra/) (CalNAGPRA), as well as the international treaty [UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property](https://www.unesco.org/en/legal-affairs/convention-means-prohibiting-and-preventing-illicit-import-export-and-transfer-ownership-cultural).

Our [collections](https://www.famsf.org/collections) are searchable by the public in an online database accessed from our website. Continuously updated, this database contains images and information about many works in our collections. Culturally sensitive works are not imaged on the website.  


##  Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) 

For inquiries and NAGPRA consultation, please contact [nagpra@famsf.org](mailto:nagpra@famsf.org).

FAMSF complies with [NAGPRA](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/nagpra/index.htm), a federal law of the United States passed in 1990 that compels museums and institutions that receive federal funding to consult with Native American Tribes and lineal descendants concerning human remains and other cultural items in their collections “. . . to address the rights of lineal descendants, Indian Tribes, and Native Hawaiian organizations to Native American cultural items, including human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, and objects of cultural patrimony.” 

As of April 2024, FAMSF has deaccessioned all Native American human remains currently in the Museums’ physical possession through FAMSF’s formal deaccessioning process. The Museum will continue to care for these remains until they are repatriated to affiliated communities per NAGPRA.

FAMSF’s ongoing work includes actively engaging in consultation with Tribes concerning Ancestral human remains. FAMSF is prioritizing the inventory completion and reporting that follows consultation per NAGPRA and California Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (CalNAGPRA) regulations, and the subsequent repatriation of Ancestral human remains.

### **Repatriation claims received (consultation in process)**

  * FAMSF has received a NAGPRA (25 U.S.C. § 3001 et seq.) claim from the Central Council of Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska for 12 items: 6 identified as Objects of Cultural Patrimony and 6 items identified as Unassociated Funerary Objects. Consultation is in process.

  * FAMSF received a NAGPRA (25 U.S.C. 3001 et seq) claim from the Pueblo of Acoma for an earthenware jar in January 2020. Consultation is in process.




### **Repatriation complete (awaiting physical transfer to Tribe)**

In accordance with the NAGPRA (25 U.S.C. § 3001 et seq) and its implementing regulations (43 CFR Part 10), FAMSF submitted a Notice of Intended Repatriation for three unassociated funerary objects to the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma and the Chickasaw Nation in February 2024 ([Federal Register, Volume 89, Number 36, February 22, 2024](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/02/22/2024-03571/notice-of-intent-to-repatriate-cultural-items-fine-arts-museums-of-san-francisco-san-francisco-ca)). FAMSF transferred control of the objects to the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma and the Chickasaw Nation in [June 2024](https://www.famsf.org/press-room/repatriation-funerary-objects-choctaw-nation-chickasaw-nation). The items are awaiting physical transfer to the Tribes. 

In accordance with the NAGPRA (25 U.S.C. § 3001 et seq) and its implementing regulations (43 CFR Part 10), FAMSF has submitted a Notice of Intended Repatriation for two lots of objects of cultural patrimony to the Shingle Springs Band of Miwok Indians, Shingle Springs Rancheria (Verona Tract), United Auburn Indian Community of the Auburn Rancheria of California, and Wilton Rancheria [(Federal Register, Volume 90, Number 115, June 17, 2025](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/06/17/2025-11137/notice-of-intended-repatriation-fine-arts-museums-of-san-francisco-san-francisco-ca)). 

### **Past repatriation**

In accordance with the NAGPRA (25 U.S.C. § 3001 et seq) and its implementing regulations (43 CFR Part 10), FAMSF repatriated a shield to the Pueblo of Acoma in September 2023 ([Federal Register, Volume 88, Number 110, June 8, 2023](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/06/08/2023-12285/notice-of-intent-to-repatriate-cultural-items-fine-arts-museums-of-san-francisco-san-francisco-ca)).  


##  California Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (CalNAGPRA) 

For inquiries and CalNAGPRA consultation, please contact [nagpra@famsf.org](mailto:nagpra@famsf.org).

FAMSF is required to comply with state law [CalNAGPRA](https://nahc.ca.gov/calnagpra/) (California Health & Safety Code §§ 8010-30) that “requires all state agencies and museums that receive state funding and that have possession or control over collections of human remains or cultural items to provide a process for the identification and repatriation of these items to the appropriate Tribes.”

In preparation for FAMSF’s submission of a preliminary inventory to the Native American Heritage Commission (Commission) under CalNAGPRA, FAMSF compiled an itemized list of the “California Indian Tribe human remains”/“California Native American human remains” in the collection of FAMSF. Provenance research is also in process. We have notified California Indian Tribes on the Commission’s contact list that may be culturally affiliated with these human remains. We are consulting with California Indian Tribes that may be culturally affiliated with the human remains to establish cultural affiliation and submit our final inventory to the Commission as soon as possible so we can repatriate the human remains to the appropriate Tribes. 

**Collection history**

Founding collections of the de Young museum, now part of FAMSF, were established in 1895 from the 1894 California Midwinter International Exposition held in Golden Gate Park, San Francisco. In the late 1890s and very early 20th century, human remains from California were donated to the museum by private citizens.

As an art museum, FAMSF does not display or interpret Native American human remains and seeks to repatriate all remaining holdings. None of the remains have been on view since the new de Young building opened in 2005; museum records do not indicate that such remains were on view before 2005. FAMSF does not conduct any scientific research or study on these holdings, and they are housed in restricted storage. There is no physical or digital access to the remains by the public, and FAMSF staff access the remains only as necessary for responsible stewardship.

As of April 2024, FAMSF has deaccessioned all California Native American human remains currently in the Museums’ physical possession through FAMSF’s formal deaccessioning process. FAMSF will repatriate the remains to affiliated communities per CalNAGPRA and NAGPRA. 

### **Long-term loans and physical possession**

FAMSF seeks to repatriate California Native American human remains currently in its physical possession. In the 1960s, FAMSF granted long-term loans of collections to other public institutions and entities for “exhibition, care and study.” We have renewed our efforts to recall and resolve these outstanding loans and will submit updated inventories in the future, as applicable.

### **Past repatriation of California Native American human remains**

On March 1, 1996, FAMSF repatriated 91 Ohlone Ancestral human remains from Point Richmond, Contra Costa County, to Andrew Galvin, the Ohlone Indian Tribe, Mission San Jose, Fremont, California. (Inventory submitted for 9 accessions representing 91 items to the National NAGPRA Program on May 29, 1996.)  


##  International repatriation 

### **Repatriation of mural fragments from Teotihuacan, Mexico**

The Teotihuacan mural fragments were donated to the museums in 1976 through a bequest from Harald J. Wagner. The provenience, or place of origin, of the mural fragments was discovered nearly a decade later through an archaeological excavation project that was jointly supported by the US National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), the Department of Anthropology at the University of Rochester, the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, and Mexico’s National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH). This project, led by archaeologist René Millon, determined that the mural fragments originated from an elite residential compound at Teotihuacan called Techinantitla.

In 1981, FAMSF entered into an agreement with the government of Mexico under which over half of the bequest to the Museums by Wagner of 70 Teotihuacan mural fragments were voluntarily returned to Mexico. The agreement also provided for the joint conservation of the fragments by conservators from the United States. This agreement and collaboration laid a foundation for decades of exhibition projects and cultural programming with Mexico.

### **Repatriation of Māori Ancestral human remains to the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, Wellington, New Zealand**

In 2018, FAMSF [repatriated eight Ancestral human remains](https://www.tepapa.govt.nz/about/press-and-media/press-releases/2018-media-releases/maori-and-moriori-ancestral-remains-offered) identified as Māori to the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. FAMSF continues to work with the national Karanga Aotearoa repatriation program concerning an additional cranium in the collection that is classified as “indeterminate and uncertain but likely to be Māori.” Repatriation of the human remains to New Zealand was the culmination of research to confirm the cultural affiliation of remains in FAMSF’s collection after receiving a request from the New Zealand government. The national Karanga Aotearoa repatriation program is administered by the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa.

### **Repatriation of two Ancestral human remains to the Philippines**

On May 21, 2025, the Philippine National Commission for Culture and the Arts and FAMSF agreed to the repatriation of two crania collected by US military personnel during the Philippine-American War (February 4, 1899–July 4, 1902) between the Philippines and the United States. The first crania, identified as Moro, was collected by E. A. Eddy, Company C, 23rd Regiment, USA, and donated by his mother, Mrs. Samuel Miller, on February 17, 1903. The second crania, from the island of Luzon, was donated by Abraham Mayer, March 2, 1905.

In his remarks, Consul General Neil Ferrer said that the repatriation is not only “about returning the remains to their place of origin” but also “about restoring dignity to those who came before us . . . it is also about healing — through acknowledgment and through continued dialogue.” He stated his hope that the repatriation may “inspire similar acts of restitution across the globe.”  


##  Deaccessioning Benin Bronzes 

On March 20, 2025, four FAMSF Benin royal court objects were presented for second-step deaccessioning in alignment with the Museums’ Collection Management Policy, and guiding principles of cultural stewardship and ethical responsibility, and in collaboration with Nigerian authorities. Their removal from our collection was guided by a thoughtful approach and aligned with practices that have supported future partnerships at peer institutions.

The Benin Bronzes originated from Benin City, the capital of the Kingdom of Benin, which prospered from the 14th to the 17th century. In 1897, the British military invaded the Benin Kingdom and looted thousands of royal artworks. Today, Benin City is part of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the current [Oba (King) of Benin](https://edojudiciary.gov.ng/appointment_portfolio/the-oba-of-benin-his-royal-majesty-omo-noba-nedo-uku-akpolokpolo-oba-ewuare-ii/#:~:text=The%20Oba%20of%20Benin.,%E2%80%93%20Edo%20State%20Judiciary) is His Royal Majesty, Omo N’Oba N’Edo, Uku Akpolokpolo Oba Ewuare II. 

FAMSF had four artworks in the Benin royal court style. Among these, the Museums identified two as Benin Bronzes: a bronze plaque and a bronze hip ornament. FAMSF acquired these objects from the international art market at Sotheby’s and the Alexander-Suggs Gallery of African Art, respectively. In 2022, they were proactively taken off display in the Arts of Africa gallery following a review of their provenance. The other two artworks reflect the Benin royal court style and are carved in wood; they include a representation of the Oba's head and a ceremonial table or stool. These were gifted to the Museums by Herbert and Nancy Baker, and the Robert and Helen Kuhn Family Trust. The stool was displayed in the gallery from 2005 to 2022. FAMSF has not exhibited the head of the Oba since 2005. Information about these artworks is accessible on our website. 

The plaque, hip ornament, and table or stool are listed on [Digital Benin](https://digitalbenin.org/institutions/10), a platform that consolidates global collections, historical photographs, and documentation related to the Benin Kingdom’s looted objects. FAMSF is a member of Digital Benin and participates in the initiative to provide a comprehensive and accessible overview of Benin objects. FAMSF engages with consultants, conducts ongoing provenance research, and works to advance the repatriation of these artworks in alignment with the above-mentioned ethical codes of conduct and professional practices, including the Arts Council of the African Studies Association’s [Working Group on Collaboration, Collections, and Restitution Best Practices](https://www.acasaonline.org/collaboration-collections-and-restitution-best-practices-for-north-american-museums-holding-african-objects-working-group/).

In response to mounting evidence of looting and increasing demands for restitution, numerous institutions across Europe and the United States have begun returning Benin objects. Notable repatriations by peer US institutions include:

  * Smithsonian Institution (2022): Returned 29 Benin Bronzes to Nigeria’s National Commission for Museums and Monuments (NCMM).

  * The Metropolitan Museum of Art (2021): Committed to returning over 100 Benin Bronzes, having already returned three and entered a loan agreement with Nigerian authorities.

  * Stanley Museum of Art (2024): Repatriated two Benin Bronzes to the Oba of Benin, signaling a shift within US museums to reconsider the ethics of holding colonial artifacts.




The deaccessioning of FAMSF’s four Benin-style artworks, marked an initial step in fostering dialogue and potential partnerships with the Oba of Benin and the NCMM.
