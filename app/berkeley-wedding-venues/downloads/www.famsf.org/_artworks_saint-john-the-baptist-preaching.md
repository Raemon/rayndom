  * ###  Transcript 

Narrator: Leaning out over the crowd hanging on his every word, St John the Baptist gestures urgently toward a ray of light splitting the stormy sky. According to the Biblical New Testament, John foretold the coming of Jesus Christ, son of God. Chief Curator Emily Beeny:

Emily Beeny: _There's a real theatricality to the lighting, to the positioning of the viewer, to the billow of the draperies, to the dramatic movement of St. John's body. I think really some of these effects are quite literally borrowed from the theater_. 

Narrator: John’s astounding message is shown by his finger, pointing up to heaven. And the banner on his staff announces in Latin: “Behold the Lamb of God”. Christ, whose life would be sacrificed to redeem his followers, is often represented by a lamb. A real lamb held by someone in the crowd emphasizes the symbolism. The painting makes us _feel_ like we’re part of that crowd. 

Emily Beeny: _It's really a picture that wants to sweep us up into its action._

Narrator: Made by Italian artist Mattia Preti around 1665, it’s a wonderful example of Baroque art, full of drama and emotion. Art was often used as a powerful tool by the Catholic church at this time to fight back against the spread of Protestantism.

Emily Beeny: _The desire of the Catholic Church to enlist the senses of the faithful in spiritual experience - this is a picture that responds to that new mandate, to make us feel as though we are physically in the presence of this holy figure_.   





Originally displayed above an altar, this composition thrusts its beholder into a crowd gathered at the feet of Saint John the Baptist as he foretells the coming of Christ. A banderole unfurling from his staff reads Ecce Agnus Dei (Behold the Lamb of God), referring to Christ’s role in Catholic doctrine as a sacrificial lamb. Mattia Preti painted this picture in Malta, where he belonged to a lay religious order called the Knights of Malta, whose patron saint was John the Baptist. The composition’s engulfing, operatic drama speaks both to its author’s religious convictions and to the expectations of the contemporary Catholic Church.
