Narrator: Curator Renee Dreyfus:

Dreyfus: _This marvelous image of a gift bearer is from the fabled city of Persepolis, which is located in today's southwestern Iran_. _And it dates back over 2,500 years - it was during this time that the Persians had the greatest empire that the world had ever seen._

Narrator: This gift bearer originally decorated a monumental stone staircase. He was part of a carved portrayal of a procession of attendants carrying food, drink and animals to a royal banquet or religious ritual. 

Dreyfus:_His dress and his pose identify him as a Persian servant, and he was bringing a filled vessel for the celebration_. _He is wearing what's known as a bashlyk - it's one piece of fabric, but when you look closely at it you can see curls from his hair, curled mustache, and from his beard, almost like snails wrapped around, peeking out_.

Narrator: Now, look between this gift bearer, and the larger carving of the “winged genius” to the left – made around 300 years earlier. You can see how the Persians were inspired by Assyrian art. But in those 300 years, a little more realism has crept into the Persian carving. That’s probably because of the influence of more naturalistic Greek art – a sign of the growing connections between cultures in the Mediterranean and the Near East.  





Persepolis is today a complex of ruins, dating back 2,500 years to Iran's Achaemenid Period. This exquisitely carved Persian relief sculpture is from this fabled city, located in modern Iran, shows the head and shoulders of a bearded Persian offering bearer in profile. He wears the typical pleated bashlyk, one piece of cloth wrapped around the head, chin, and neck. Curls of his beard, mustache, and hair peek from under the headdress. The relief dates to one of the great periods of Iranian civilization when the kings of the Achaemenid dynasty established an empire that brought stability, prosperity, and a flourishing civilization to the Near East. This monarchy prospered for over 200 years (550-330 BC) until its downfall at the hands of Alexander the Great. The architecture of the magnificent Achaemenid palaces was distinguished by sculpted stonework relief decoration such as this example.
