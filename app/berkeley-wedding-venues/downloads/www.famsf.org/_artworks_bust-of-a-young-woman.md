#  Bust of a Young Woman 

ca. 1890

[ Mary Cassatt ](https://www.famsf.org/art-finder?artist=11)

Not on view

In this unfinished portrait of a young woman, the freely crosshatched backdrop of yellow and light-blue pastel strokes underscores the sitter's sour expression (made evident by her arched eyebrows). Mary Cassatt's bold pastel techniques and unconventional palette were deeply influenced by her close friendship with Edgar Degas, who held this work in his personal art collection.
