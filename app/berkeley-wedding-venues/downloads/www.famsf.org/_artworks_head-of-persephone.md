Narrator: In Greek mythology, the fate of the young goddess, Persephone, explained why spring followed winter.

The story goes that Hades, King of the Underworld, abducted Persephone in his chariot. A yawning gap in the earth opened, and they disappeared into the darkness beneath. Her mother Demeter, goddess of harvests, was grief-stricken. She caused the crops to fail, and everyone starved. So Persephone was allowed to return to earth. But she’d eaten six forbidden pomegranate seeds in Hades’s kingdom. So she had to spend half of each year in the Underworld, and half on earth. The ancient Greeks believed her reunion with her mother heralded springtime, each year.

This beautiful Roman head of Persephone was once part of a whole sculpted figure. It closely copies ancient Greek portrayals of her made around 500 years earlier. Roman culture drew heavily on ancient Greece – especially from their mythology and art. This figure may have been made as a cult figure for the worship of Persephone and her mother Demeter – whose statue might have been placed nearby.

Persephone’s voluminous hair is a hallmark of early Greek sculpture. Curator in charge of Ancient Art, Renee Dreyfus:

Dreyfus: _It's parted in the middle and it falls in these wavy tresses that frame Persephone's face, and there's delicate carving - you can see how careful the carving is._ _And what provides the work with its most characteristic and identifiable trait is this large twist of hair gathered at the back, and it's held in place with hairpins and secured by this wide band encircling Persephone's hair. It's so realistic._  





This exquisite, over-life-size marble head of Persephone, the goddess of spring and queen of the underworld, is a work of art and a window into Greek and Roman beliefs in an afterlife. Carved in Roman times, during the early first century AD, this head of Persephone hearkens to the transitional Severe style in ancient Greek sculpture, ca. 460 BC, marking the shift from the Archaic to the early Classical period. This style is a fascinating chapter in art history, notable for its newfound interest in naturalism and a burst of new artistic forms. Persephone’s voluminous hair, a hallmark of an earlier Greek style, is parted in the middle and falls in waves, framing her face. The most distinctive feature is the twist of hair gathered at the back, held in place by hairpins and a headband. 

In ancient Greek mythology and religion, Persephone was the daughter of Zeus and Demeter, the goddess of grain and agriculture. She was abducted by the god Hades and brought to the underworld to live with him. While she was gone, her mother grieved and stopped the earth from producing crops; all the fields and plants died off, animals starved, and famine spread across the world. Zeus forced Hades to return Persephone for the part of the year when springtime returns and the earth is renewed. Because of this cycle of nature, Persephone and Demeter became the central figures in the Eleusinian Mysteries. This secretive religious cult promised resurrection and eternal life to initiates, a belief inspired by Persephone’s abduction and joyous return.
