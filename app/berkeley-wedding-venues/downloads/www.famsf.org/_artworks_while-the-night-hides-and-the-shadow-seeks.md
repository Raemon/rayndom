#  While the Night hides and the Shadow seeks 

2024

[ Rupy C. Tut ](https://www.famsf.org/art-finder?artist=12216)

Not on view

In 2024 Rupy C. Tut spent two weeks at the legendary Crown Point Press in San Francisco, where she produced six prints, including _While the Night hides and the Shadow seeks_. Born in India and now based in Oakland, Tut was influenced by and trained in the techniques of eighteenth-century Indian painting, creating richly narrative and colorful scenes that engage with social issues of our moment, from identity to the environment. The importance of linework to her art, here executed using soft-ground etching, is evident in the intricate nature of the organic motifs that surround the reclining figure at the center of this print. The contrast between the central red space and the deep blue hue of the mountainscape—both colors were achieved with aquatint—stands for, in the artist’s words, the “relationship which we share with landscape and time.” This etching is a compelling example of how an artist translates their practice and visual language into intaglio printmaking, embracing the unpredictability of the medium.
