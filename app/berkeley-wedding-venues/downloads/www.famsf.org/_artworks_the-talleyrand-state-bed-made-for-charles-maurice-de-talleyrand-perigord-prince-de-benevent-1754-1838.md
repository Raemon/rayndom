  * ###  Transcript 

Narrator: This majestic bed was made for Prince Talleyrand – among the most intriguing figures in French history. Poet and former gallery teacher Kim Shuck:

Shuck: _He’s been described as a genius –_ _just a fascinating human being, and somebody who was born to privilege, who in a time where privilege was being vehemently rejected, managed to survive a series of events that killed off most of his peers_.

Narrator: These events included the French Revolution. Talleyrand, a wily politician, avoided the execution or exile that awaited many of his fellow aristocrats by working for the Revolutionary administration. Later, he helped bring Napoleon to power – and then engineer his downfall. 

The bed is made for splendor, not for comfort – or privacy. Royal and aristocratic power-brokers at the time received favored guests in a state bedroom in their palace or chateau. An opulent bed stood in as a kind of throne. They would usually sleep in smaller, private apartments elsewhere.

Shuck: _That is an object that’s about being seen._ _This is absolutely a statement of the power to control the narrative, the power to control the resources_.

Narrator: Such a bed was an opportunity to display wealth as well as authority. The silk draperies in particular would have been extremely costly. And the gilded bedframe includes sphinx heads beside the pillows. These recall Napoleon’s Egyptian military campaigns – Talleyrand was then still his valued advisor.
