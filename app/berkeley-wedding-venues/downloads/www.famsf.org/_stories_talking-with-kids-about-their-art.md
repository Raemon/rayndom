#  Talking with Kids about Their Art 

May 6, 2020

When looking at or making art with children at the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, using questions is a core teaching approach. In response to our inquiries, children increase their ability to think critically about their experiences.

Here are some questions we regularly use with young artists in the museum’s studios. These questions are specially designed to encourage and, at times, challenge the artist’s thinking. A focus on process empowers students to expand their interests and abilities and can foster further curiosity and experimentation.

The list below includes frequently exhibited behaviors from children ages 6–11, and questions that teaching artists ask to focus students on the creative process.

**“I’m Not an Artist”: The Reticent Child**

**“I Can’t Do It”: The Frustrated Child**  


![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7) ![Drawing of child making art with parent](https://www.famsf.org/storage/images/9c24a076-ea02-45e5-8a42-6884098a8153/kids-frustrated-02-no-title.jpg?crop=1500,1500,x0,y0&format=jpg&quality=80&width=1000) ![Drawing of child making art with parent](https://www.famsf.org/storage/images/9c24a076-ea02-45e5-8a42-6884098a8153/kids-frustrated-02-no-title.jpg?crop=1500,1500,x0,y0&format=jpg&quality=80&width=1000)

  * What would happen if you tried __________ (ways of using tools)?
  * What are some ways we can work with what just happened?



**“Do It for Me”: The Unconfident Child**

![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7) ![Drawing of child making art with parent](https://www.famsf.org/storage/images/46eea44c-ddf4-4500-8075-e3b3f43c2e55/kids-unconfident-02-no-title.jpg?crop=1500,1500,x0,y0&format=jpg&quality=80&width=1000) ![Drawing of child making art with parent](https://www.famsf.org/storage/images/46eea44c-ddf4-4500-8075-e3b3f43c2e55/kids-unconfident-02-no-title.jpg?crop=1500,1500,x0,y0&format=jpg&quality=80&width=1000)

  * What have you already tried?
  * Tell me about what you are trying to create.
  * Let's practice together on a separate piece of paper. (Note: Demonstrate for the child ways to simplify what they are trying to achieve.)
  * What did you learn from sketching out your idea?
  * How can you include these new ideas into your composition?



**“I Am an Artist”: The Confident Child**

  * Tell me about your art work.
  * Tell me about the idea you started with. What did you discover while creating your composition?
  * What tools or techniques have you tried?
  * Did you invent a technique?



## **Reflection**

The work is not over when the artwork is complete! Discussing the experience of making artwork during and after art making cements discoveries and learning for the next project.

  * What words would you use to describe your work?
  * How is your artwork the same as something you have seen before? How is it different?
  * What was rewarding during the process of making? What was challenging? What was surprising?
  * If you were to repeat the project, what would you do again? What would you do differently?
  * How could you continue these ideas and experiments in a new artwork?
  * What advice would you give to someone else doing this activity?
