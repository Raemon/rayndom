#  Bouquets to Art 

Our annual floral fundraiser features a week of blossoms and bouquets inspired by artwork and architecture of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco.

A visitor favorite, Bouquets to Art offers new ways of engaging with our permanent collection, with floral installations throughout our galleries. This week-long fundraiser is made in collaboration with the San Francisco Auxiliary of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco. Proceeds from Bouquets to Art underwrite exhibitions, conservation projects, and education programs at the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco.

## Bouquets to Art 2025

The 41st annual Bouquets to Art was a record-breaking success and we are overflowing with gratitude! 

We’re grateful for so many things: our community’s generous support throughout the week in the galleries; our dedicated San Francisco Auxiliary for their tireless, year-long effort planning Bouquets to Art at both the de Young and the Legion of Honor; annual sponsors who underwrite this beloved initiative; the 100+ floral exhibitors and their incredible artistry; the talented City College of San Francisco students for their floral fashion designs showcased in the Piazzoni Murals Room; our terrific in-kind sponsors and raffle prize donors; and for our Auxiliary Members who filled more than 525 volunteer shifts during the week. 

We are thrilled to report that we welcomed nearly 60,000 guests into our flower-filled permanent collection galleries in the de Young and the Legion of Honor and raised $740,000. 

From all of us, thank you for all you do to support the Fine Arts Museums.
