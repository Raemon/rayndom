  * ###  Transcript 

Narrator: The most important people in this painting, as you probably guessed, are in the center: the Virgin Mary, and her baby son Jesus. 

The lion peeking in at lower left points to the identity of the older man beside him. According to legend, the lion became St Jerome’s devoted friend after he pulled a thorn from its paw. We can often identify saints by symbols like this. For St Bartholomew to the right, it’s the bloody knife in his hand - he was flayed alive for being Christian.

Originally hung in a church, the painting was made by Raffaellino del Garbo in 1502 in Florence, Italy – then a wealthy city-state. It would have been very costly, especially as it features the vivid ultramarine blue for Mary’s skirt made from precious ground lapis lazuli stone. 

The painting was made at the height of the Renaissance, a cultural shift born in Florence. Chief Curator Emily Beeny: 

Emily Beeny: _So when we talk about the Renaissance, we're using a word that means rebirth. And by that we really mean a rebirth of interest in classical antiquity. And I think one of the hallmarks of that is a new kind of naturalism, a desire to make works of art that convince us of their reality_. 

Narrator: On a nearby wall, a ceramic piece shows Mary and Jesus surrounded by green leaves and yellow lemons. Sharing a sensibility with the painting, it was made around the same time, also in Florence, by the famous della Robbia family workshop. 

Emily Beeny: _There is an amazing illusionism to this whole object, that encourages us to feel as though we could reach out and pluck a lemon, or, you know, caress the cheek of the little infant Christ. I think we sense the spiritual purpose that this kind of illusionism was meant to serve, in forging a more direct and human connection between the onlooker and the Holy Figures represented_.   





Painted in costly jewel tones, this grand altarpiece originally graced the chapel of the Frescobaldi family at the church of San Spirito, in Florence. Holding a lily, emblem of her purity, the Virgin Mary regards her son with serene tenderness. At their feet kneel the penitent Saint Jerome, beating his chest with a rock, and the martyred Saint Bartholomew, displaying a bloody knife. All eyes turn to the Christ Child, except for those of the angel at right, who returns our gaze with a placid smile. The artist’s signature appears just below this figure.
