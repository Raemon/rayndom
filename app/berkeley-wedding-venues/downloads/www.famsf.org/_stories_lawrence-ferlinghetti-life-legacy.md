## **Little Boy — A Life Larger Than Dreams**

Almost 102 years old. Not bad for the fifth child of a modest family. Born in 1919, in Yonkers, New York, Lawrence Ferlinghetti crawled into life in the aftermath of the brutal polio epidemic that had ravaged New York in 1916 and the deadly global flu pandemic of 1918.

His father, Carlo Ferlinghetti, who emigrated from Brescia, Italy, in 1892, died just before his birth. His mother, Clemence Mendes-Monsanto — of French and Portuguese Sephardic Jewish descent — was institutionalized. The newborn Lawrence was taken by his maternal aunt, Emily, first to France for a few years and then back to the US, where he drifted through the instability of childhood and adolescence. The Great Depression was approaching, scorching lives and dreams throughout the 1930s, all the way to the chaos of World War II.

## **WWII, in the Navy, Early ’40s**

Ferlinghetti’s youth was a pendulum swing between abandonment and the hope of adoption. The wealthy Bisland family eventually took him in after the loss of their own child, also named Lawrence. It was perhaps this early lesson in impermanence that nourished Ferlinghetti’s profound gratitude for life, always lived without a net, embracing the present — hence his insatiable pursuit of dreams and commitment to fighting for the less fortunate. 

From 1940 to 1944, Ferlinghetti served in the navy, zigzagging the globe — “never one day behind a desk.” He witnessed firsthand the horrors of war: Pearl Harbor, D-Day, and __ Nagasaki (seven weeks after the atomic bomb dropped). That vision of a postapocalyptic, [Kiefer](https://gagosian.com/artists/anselm-kiefer/)-like hellscape left a permanent mark: “I was totally politically naive — a good American boy — before seeing human flesh fused to a teacup, bones and hair sticking out of mulch.”

## **Higher Education, Late ’40s**

Art was always in Ferlinghetti’s life: “I wanted to be a painter, but from the age of 10 onward these damn poems kept coming. Perhaps one of these days they will leave me alone and I can get back to painting.” He expertly drew and sketched ideas, images, and words in his many travel notebooks. From his master’s thesis at Columbia on John Ruskin’s critique of Turner to his years in postwar Paris — which he called “the happiest time of my life” — Ferlinghetti was always absorbing art. In Paris, he earned a PhD from the Sorbonne in comparative literature, writing his dissertation on the city as a symbol in modern poetry.

## **San Francisco, the Last Frontier, Early ’50s**

At the dawn of the 1950s, Ferlinghetti and his wife, Selden Kirby-Smith, moved to the Last Frontier, drawn to the city’s Mediterranean light — just as the San Francisco Renaissance, led by Kenneth Rexroth, was blossoming. In 1953, Ferlinghetti partnered with another first-generation Italian American, Peter D. Martin, to launch a “literary meeting place” in North Beach. City Lights broke the bookstore mold: open until midnight, seven days a week. Two years later, in 1955, it also became a publisher, editing only affordable paperbacks, with the aim to democratize culture and build societal awareness. Ferlinghetti’s _Pictures of the Gone World_ (1955) was the first in their famous Pocket Poets Series.

This cultural rising tide contributed to the broader American counterculture that would shape the nation (and ripple overseas) for the next several decades. Ferlinghetti published Allen Ginsberg’s _Howl and Other Poems_ (1956). He praised Ginsberg by quoting Ralph Waldo Emerson’s words to Walt Whitman on _Leaves of Grass_ : “I greet you at the beginning of a great career.” 

The collection’s obscenity trial brought both men under national scrutiny and set a legal precedent for freedom of speech and expression in 1957. With the support of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), Ferlinghetti defended not only Ginsberg’s poem but also the broader principle of artistic freedom. The victory cemented both Ferlinghetti and Ginsberg as central figures in American literary history. 

A new underground literary movement emerged in the wake of the trial: the “Beat Generation.” And Ferlinghetti became the godfather and publisher of the Beats and post-Beats (Jack Kerouac, William S. Burroughs, Gary Snyder, Gregory Corso, Diane di Prima, to mention a few). He was a patron of their experimentations with art, poetry, music, readings, performances, happenings, and social activism.

In the meantime, Ferlinghetti’s poetry collection _A Coney Island of the Mind_ (1958) was published by New Directions, making him a living legend at 39. One of the most significant achievements in 20th-century American poetry, it sold over one million copies worldwide. He was a prolific writer, visual artist, performer, and social activist whose creative life spanned the page, canvas, stage, and streets. He authored more than 30 books of poetry and three novels. His spirit of freedom, humor, and imagination lives on in galleries and bookstores, on city walls, and in readers’ hearts — singing through the streets of the world, because, as he once wrote: “Poetry is eternal graffiti written in the heart of everyone.”
