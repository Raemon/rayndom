How do original drawings like those on view in [_Art of Manga_](https://www.famsf.org/exhibitions/art-of-manga) come to be serialized in magazines and then printed in books? 

In late 2024, the PLAY! MUSEUM in Tokyo held an exhibition titled _ONE PIECE ONLY_ that explored the production process behind the bestselling manga series _ONE PIECE_ by Oda Eiichiro.

It also celebrated the publication of 1,000 serialized chapters and 100 volumes of this one-of-a-kind manga. This is the exhibition’s first overseas venue. _ONE PIECE ONLY: How Manga is Made_ is on view September 27, 2025 to January 25, 2026 in the Piazzoni Murals Room at the de Young.

_ONE PIECE_ holds the Guinness World Record for the manga with the most copies published for the same comic book series by a single author, with over 500 million copies in print worldwide. 

In the installation, chapters 1 to 1110 of _ONE PIECE_ , cut directly from the manga, are mounted on fabric and laid out continuously on the gallery wall to create a unique immersive experience.

The exhibition features two short films that take you behind the scenes of the production of _Weekly Shonen Jump_ and _Jump Comics_. Photographs, color proofs, and printing plates are displayed in “Treasure Boxes” throughout the installation.

Every fan reads this manga, but how is it actually made?

Follow along on _ONE PIECE_ ’s journey through various stages of production into two different formats (and sizes): _Weekly Shonen Jump_ magazine and a _Jump Comics_ book.****

## Putting pencil to paper: 0 → 364 mm × 257 mm 

A manga begins life at the writer’s desk. Traditionally, rough sketches are drawn on a blank sheet of paper. As details are drawn and dialogue is added, the story slowly takes shape. After this initial drafting stage, the manga is drawn on B4-size (364 mm x 257 mm) manuscript paper. Next comes the inking of the outlines, solid coloring, and application of screen tone, which gives shade, texture, and other nuances to the images. 

For Oda Eiichiro, creating a story and bringing the characters to life by hand are tasks completed solely by him. The manga is produced at a pace of about a dozen pages per week.

![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7) ![A brightly-lit installation of Oda Eiichiro’s desk](https://www.famsf.org/storage/images/f0037795-16b2-4b90-84c2-ffd87dfbb922/desk-oda-eiichiron-nhonjo-2024.jpg?crop=2000,1333,x0,y0&format=jpg&quality=80&width=1000) ![A brightly-lit installation of Oda Eiichiro’s desk](https://www.famsf.org/storage/images/f0037795-16b2-4b90-84c2-ffd87dfbb922/desk-oda-eiichiron-nhonjo-2024.jpg?crop=2000,1333,x0,y0&format=jpg&quality=80&width=1000)

Box 1: Desk of Oda Eiichiro. Photograph by Naoki Honjo, 2024. _ONE PIECE_ storyboards are drawn across two B4-size pages (257 mm x 364 mm) using a B-grade pencil on white paper.  


## Preparing to be published in an anthology magazine: 364 mm × 257 mm → 257 mm × 182 mm

The B5-size (257 mm ×182 mm) _Weekly Shonen Jump_ magazine is produced using the original artwork drawn on B4-size (364 mm × 257 mm) paper. The primary production takes place at Shueisha’s Kyodo Printing Headquarters (Jinbocho, Tokyo) and the Kyodo Printing Goka Plant (Ibaraki Prefecture). The exhibition includes aerial photographs of these sites taken by well-known photographer Naoki Honjo.

Shueisha Headquarters, Tokyo  


The editor receives the original artwork, or _genga_ , and scans it in high-contrast black and white. At this point, the text elements are added, including speech bubbles and sound effects. These are carefully combined with the drawings to ensure that they match up correctly. Pages are finalized, with titles, leads, and tables of contents added before printing.

In 2021, the 1000th chapter of _ONE PIECE_ was produced. The platemaking and typesetting were done at the Kyodo Printing Headquarters. During this process, the image data was burned onto transparent platemaking film. This negative was then used to create a yellow resin printing plate.

![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7) ![A yellow-toned image of a manga printing plate](https://www.famsf.org/storage/images/f9f9329a-3ec6-4d13-b20d-37ab9b98384d/rotary-letterpress-printing-plate.jpeg?crop=2000,1333,x0,y0&format=jpg&quality=80&width=1000) ![A yellow-toned image of a manga printing plate](https://www.famsf.org/storage/images/f9f9329a-3ec6-4d13-b20d-37ab9b98384d/rotary-letterpress-printing-plate.jpeg?crop=2000,1333,x0,y0&format=jpg&quality=80&width=1000)

Rotary letterpress printing plate  


Because resin plates gradually wear out, printing large runs of _Weekly Shonen Jump_ required multiple resin plates, which were sent almost daily from Tokyo to their factory in Ibaraki Prefecture. 

As of 2024, this process has been improved upon, and now the completed platemaking data is sent over the network to Kyodo Printing’s Goka Plant. A Computer-to-plate (CTP) flow uses data to generate images, which are then output directly onto printing plates. The material used to produce the printing plates has also changed, and these are now milky white. The platemaking film and yellow resin plates on view are valuable objects that document the evolution of the technology that supports manga magazine printing.

_Weekly Shonen Jump_ is printed using a rotary letterpress (a printing press that uses curved printing plates mounted on cylinders). The production process is carried out at Kyodo Printing’s Goka Plant. Using massive rolls of paper weighing 450 kg, it prints more than 1.5 million pages per hour.

![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7) ![A low-angle shot of a large industrial printing facility with many huge rolls of paper](https://www.famsf.org/storage/images/a55582f9-a40c-4fc8-a5b5-217961adf162/kyodo-printing-goka-plant.png?crop=2000,1125,x0,y0&format=jpg&quality=80&width=1000) ![A low-angle shot of a large industrial printing facility with many huge rolls of paper](https://www.famsf.org/storage/images/a55582f9-a40c-4fc8-a5b5-217961adf162/kyodo-printing-goka-plant.png?crop=2000,1125,x0,y0&format=jpg&quality=80&width=1000)

Kyodo Printing’s Goka Plant  


One roll of paper is used every 12 to 13 minutes. The printed sheets are automatically folded. Then they are bound together with color covers and frontispieces, loaded onto pallets by robots, automatically shrink-wrapped, and delivered to trucks.

## From weekly magazine to pocket-size comic book: 257 mm × 182 mm → 176 mm × 112 mm 

A pocket-size paperback _Jump Comics_ edition (176 mm × 112 mm) of _ONE PIECE_ was created from the same data used to publish the B5-size (257 mm × 182 mm) _Weekly Shonen Jump_ magazine. Oda Eiichiro created the cover illustration for this book, _ONE PIECE_ ’s 100th volume.

![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7) ![A close-up image of the spine and cover of a One Piece manga volume](https://www.famsf.org/storage/images/0eade061-774a-455f-914f-cd7a38001e49/cover-100th-volume-one-piece.jpg?crop=2000,1333,x0,y0&format=jpg&quality=80&width=1000) ![A close-up image of the spine and cover of a One Piece manga volume](https://www.famsf.org/storage/images/0eade061-774a-455f-914f-cd7a38001e49/cover-100th-volume-one-piece.jpg?crop=2000,1333,x0,y0&format=jpg&quality=80&width=1000)

Cover of the 100th volume of _ONE PIECE_  


The 100th volume of _ONE PIECE_ had an initial print run of over 3 million copies. The design, platemaking, and printing used a large number of colors, with the aim of creating a particularly appealing and celebratory volume. While covers are typically printed in four colors, _ONE PIECE_ adds fluorescent pink to better render skin tones. For the 100th volume, fluorescent blue and yellow were also incorporated, for a total of seven vibrant colors.

To produce the monochrome pages known as _honmon_ (main text), _Jump Comics_ used the same data used to create the original _Weekly Shonen Jump_. However, _Jump Comics_ volumes are smaller (176 mm × 112 mm) than the _Weekly Shonen Jump_ magazine (257 mm × 182 mm). The aspect ratio of the finished book is different from the magazine, and therefore the placement of the manga artwork in relation to the top and bottom edges of the page has to be altered.

Reproducing the same text again offers a useful opportunity for the publishers to correct any typographical errors and omissions that were printed in the weekly magazine. Once the pages have been reset, the final document is sent from Kyodo Printing to Chuo Seihan Printing for printing and binding.

![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7) ![A brightly-lit display case with two large cylinders of manga printing plates](https://www.famsf.org/storage/images/591548ab-5311-4ab6-af35-a56dec231ff3/offset-printing-plate-blanket-one-piece-vol-100.jpg?crop=2000,1333,x0,y0&format=jpg&quality=80&width=1000) ![A brightly-lit display case with two large cylinders of manga printing plates](https://www.famsf.org/storage/images/591548ab-5311-4ab6-af35-a56dec231ff3/offset-printing-plate-blanket-one-piece-vol-100.jpg?crop=2000,1333,x0,y0&format=jpg&quality=80&width=1000)

Offset printing plate and blanket used for _ONE PIECE_ Vol. 100. Ink is transferred from a cylindrical plate to a blanket, and then onto paper — printing both sides simultaneously.  


Since the release of Volume 57 in 2010, the initial print run of every _ONE PIECE_ volume has consistently exceeded 3 million copies. To produce this number of copies, an _integrated machine_ , which performs all the processes from printing to binding, is used.

![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7) ![A panoramic view of an industrial facility with books moving along a long, winding conveyor belt](https://www.famsf.org/storage/images/c0aecf06-2b3e-4cf0-9848-db7027458db4/chuo-seihan-printing.jpg?crop=2000,527,x0,y0&format=jpg&quality=80&width=1000) ![A panoramic view of an industrial facility with books moving along a long, winding conveyor belt](https://www.famsf.org/storage/images/c0aecf06-2b3e-4cf0-9848-db7027458db4/chuo-seihan-printing.jpg?crop=2000,527,x0,y0&format=jpg&quality=80&width=1000)

Chuo Seihan Printing  


In conventional printing and binding, one fold is equal to 32 pages, and the folds are bound together. However, the integrated machine can produce two copies of a 192-page book in one go — 384 pages in total. The printed paper is automatically folded onto a large reel and comes out on a conveyer belt folded in a long, thin shape, with the same images connected above and below (called _double binding_).

![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7) ![A close-up of a double-length manga cover for the 100th volume of One Piece](https://www.famsf.org/storage/images/8a083072-c58c-4a87-ba64-8e52103bf571/double-binding.jpg?crop=2000,1333,x0,y0&format=jpg&quality=80&width=1000) ![A close-up of a double-length manga cover for the 100th volume of One Piece](https://www.famsf.org/storage/images/8a083072-c58c-4a87-ba64-8e52103bf571/double-binding.jpg?crop=2000,1333,x0,y0&format=jpg&quality=80&width=1000)

Double binding  


The top and bottom images are then cut and separated, and the cover, _obi_(belt or thin book wrap), and new-release information are attached before the volumes are stacked on a pallet. The integrated machine operates 24 hours a day with three shifts. Over one million copies are produced within a week. Each and every book becomes a unique and valuable treasure to its reader.  
  
  
This exhibition has been organized by [Shueisha Manga-Art Heritage](https://mangaart.jp/) in collaboration with the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, with generous support from the Agency for Cultural Affairs, Government of Japan.
