The Salon Doré from the Hôtel de La Trémoille is one of the most cherished spaces in the Legion of Honor. This book explores the Salon’s origins in late-18th-century Paris, chronicles its history in France and the United States from the end of the 1700s to the early 2000s, and celebrates its reinstallation in San Francisco today. Based on new research, the present restoration accurately reflects a _salon de compagnie_ from the 1780s, complete with two suites of chairs, lighting from historic fixtures, and silk upholstery derived from period documents—offering a rare glimpse of the halcyon days of its creation. Including a detailed account of salon life in the _ancien régime_ , the original 1790 inventory, and an examination of the extensive conservation project undertaken to restore it to its former glory, _The Salon Doré from the Hôtel de La Trémoille_ pays tribute to this superlative period room.
