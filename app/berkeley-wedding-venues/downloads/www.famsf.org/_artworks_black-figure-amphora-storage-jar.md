  * ###  Transcript 

Narrator: Today, we keep ancient Greek pottery in museum cases. These things are over two thousand years old, and incredibly rare and precious! But originally, they were household objects in regular use.

The big amphora to the right was used to mix wine and water, which the ancient Greeks preferred. It’s decorated with a scene of warriors fighting. On this vase, the artist painted the figures in black, leaving the red clay unpainted as background. Thin lines were incised, or carved out, to indicate details such as clothing.

Down to the left of the case is a smaller vessel decorated with the opposite color scheme. Black glaze becomes the background, and the figures are the red of the clay, with details added very delicately. The vessel was used to hold water. And it was probably made by a famous Athenian artist. Here’s curator Renee Dreyfus:

Dreyfus: _Apollo is seated on the left-hand side - and his sister is pouring wine for him, and his sister is Artemis. So we're looking at a domestic scene in Olympus where the Gods lived. And what's delightful here, is between the two of them, you see a deer. A deer is sacred to the goddess Artemis, and he looks up kind of thirstily for a drop of wine to perhaps miss the drinking vessel that Apollo is holding and perhaps even fall conveniently into its mouth._  





Attributed to a painter of the Leagros GroupExcavaed in a tomb at Vulci, 1889Side A: Warriors brawling (Ajax and Odysseus?)Side B: Dionysos with musical procession of nymphsMade at the end of the 6th century BC, this very fine, lidded amphora was used as a storage vessel for wine, milk, or perhaps pickled fish. The depiction of Dionysos, god of wine, on one side of the vase suggests it might have been used to store wine. In the vigorously painted, complex main scene on the other panel, warriors, who may represent the Homeric heroes Ajax and Odysseus, dispute the claim to the arms of Achilles. While two helpless men stand by, a peacemaker (perhaps Agamemnon) intervenes. The figures are painted in black-figure technique, in which the design was painted in black silhouette, enlivened with incised details and accessory colors, set against a red clay background. The style of drawing, with its interest in anatomical detail and lively overlapping action, has led to the vase's attribution to the Leagros Group of Greek vase painters. These artists worked in the same workshop, and their styles are closely related.
