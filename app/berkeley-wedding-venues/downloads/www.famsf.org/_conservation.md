First established as a department in the early 1970s, the conservation team now includes four specialized departments — objects, paintings, paper, and textiles. Conservation — the treatment, preservation, and technical study of works of art — is integral to FAMSF’s mission. With specialized training in chemistry, art history, and studio art, conservators work to better understand the objects in our collections and advise on the condition of proposed acquisitions and loans. Discoveries are shared through exhibitions, educational programs, and web-based media. In addition to studying and treating works of art, conservators actively collaborate across departments to address museum-wide issues, such as exhibition design, lighting, climate control, storage, disaster preparedness, and pest management. We also are committed to the education of emerging conservators through internship and fellowship programs.

To learn more about conservation, including caring for your own treasures, finding a conservator in your area, or becoming a conservator, visit the [American Institute for Conservation](https://www.culturalheritage.org/about-conservation).
