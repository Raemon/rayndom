Fraiman: _The form of this object is really something that feels out of a fairytale_.

Narrator: Curator Jeffrey Fraiman. This 18th century English porcelain tower hid a surprise.

Fraiman: _The upper chamber would've contained perfume with the scent emanating from the pierced windows._

Narrator: The tower is full of fun details -

Fraiman: - _the little birds perched on the roof, the little mischievous fox trying to get at them._

Shuck: _It feels to me like a place for your imagination to go_.

Narrator: That’s poet Kim Shuck. There was a great taste for whimsical porcelain objects in 18th century Europe. Nearby, you’ll find beautifully painted birds, apples, and even a cauliflower and a melon! You’d find those objects on a wealthy family’s dining table. Each one opened up to hold soup, sauce or desserts, delighting guests with their lifelike appearance.

Shuck: _There's also just a very human part of that, which is a fascination with new information about the world, unexpected information_.

Narrator: - reflecting the interest in fresh discoveries about the natural world and its plant and animal species at this time of global exchange and scientific discovery.
