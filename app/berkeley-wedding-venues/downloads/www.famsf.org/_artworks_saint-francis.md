Narrator: This wooden sculpture aims to make us feel we’re almost in the presence of a Christian saint - Francis of Assisi. His lifelike glass eyes gleam, and his monk’s habit, tied with a rope belt, is carved to resemble woven cloth. According to the saint’s legend, his chest wound appeared miraculously, resembling marks on Christ’s crucified body. The sculpture was intended to move those who saw it in 17th century Catholic Spain, deepening their faith.

St Francis founded the proselytizing Franciscan order of monks in the early 1300s. It quickly became part of the Catholic power structure, including in its colonies in Mexico – and California. This city is named for St Francis, after the Spanish mission established here in the 1770s. Feel free to take a seat or to explore other works nearby, while you continue to listen.

Cordero: _Hello everyone, my name is Jonathan Cordero. I’m the chair of the Ramaytush Tribe – we’re the original peoples of the San Francisco Peninsula. I am executive director of the Association of Ramaytush Ohlone, I'm an ethnohistorian and an expert on California Indian history during the Mission period_.

_The Franciscan missionaries were the primary agents of colonization in California,_ _responsible for removing California Indians from their ancestral villages. California Indians were enslaved for the purposes of building the Mission and raising crops, so they supplied the settlers and the Spanish military as well._ _The Spanish military created a culture of terror and intimidation that held people in place_. _Also, the Spanish brought up cattle and the cattle would eat the food stuffs - the grasses and the flowers and plants - that the Native peoples used for seed gathering, so effectively reduced their food supply_.

_Prior to colonization, the Ramaytush Ohlone numbered about 2000 on the San Francisco Peninsula. By the end of the Mission period in roughly 1834, only about 34 persons had survived_.

_That doesn't mean that our ancestors didn't resist. But for the most part it was complete control and near complete destruction of our people and our culture and our language_. _And today we have maybe 200 words from our original language left. And that's it._ _It's really sad and it's incredibly unfortunate. And we're trying to rebuild our community, and thankfully we have other California Indian traditions - so we're using those traditions to rebuild ourselves._  





The haunting realism of this polychromed wooden sculpture is characteristic of seventeenth-century Spanish art, meant to elicit emotion and contemplation. According to legend, the miraculously preserved body of Saint Francis of Assisi (d. 1226) appeared to Pope Nicholas V during a visit to the saint’s tomb in 1449. Saint Francis’s body is described as it appears here: intact, eyes turned heavenward, hands concealed, and one of his stigmata, or wounds, freshly bleeding on his chest. Notice, too, the gaunt face, sallow complexion, and glass eyes, liquid and eerily alive, which together evoke a suffering, sickly man.
