  * ###  Transcript 

Narrator: Leaning forward in prayer, St Francis of Assisi gazes with devotion at the carved image of Christ on the cross. The skull beneath it symbolizes death, and therefore a reminder to live a virtuous life. Born into a wealthy family in 12th century Italy, Francis experienced a spiritual transformation as a young man. He renounced his worldly goods and devoted his life to Christ, eventually founding the Franciscan order of monks. Like him, they took vows of chastity and poverty and went out to spread the word of Christ.

This portrayal of the saint was made around 1595 by El Greco. Originally from Crete, he had moved to Spain in search of work, becoming known as “El Greco”, meaning “the Greek”. His Spanish patrons were interested in finding a direct relationship with God, which is perfectly evoked by this portrayal of St Francis. Curator Isabella Lores Chavez:

Lores-Chavez: _El Greco's paintings often look like they are being acted upon by forces beyond our human control. His brushstrokes are flickering across the surface of the canvas, almost like a modern abstract painter. And part of it is a way to communicate that mystical energy that seems to be surging through these religious figures that he depicts._  





A roving preacher sworn to poverty, Saint Francis of Assisi founded the Franciscan order and formed a frequent subject for artistic commissions during the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, particularly in Italy and Spain. Here the saint, dressed in a mended habit, kneels before a crucifix. An inscription at lower right bears the artist’s signature. El Greco was born on the Greek island of Crete and trained as a Byzantine icon painter before migrating to Italy, where he developed a rapturous painterly style, and then to Spain, where he established a vast, influential studio and came to be known as “the Greek.”
