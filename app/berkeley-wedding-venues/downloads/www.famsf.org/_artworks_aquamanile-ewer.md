  * ###  Transcript 

Narrator: Look closely at this lion, and you’ll see that his tail curves up to form a handle, and his mouth contains a spout! He was filled with water through the discreet little flap on his head.

This type of vessel is called an aquamanile, from the Latin for water and hands. It was used to wash guests’ hands before and after a banquet, or perhaps during a church ritual.

With roots in Iranian Islamic culture, aquamaniles arrived in Europe through trade and conquest. The concept of a special handwashing vessel was eagerly taken up and Europeans began making their own versions. This 13th century lion was created in the city of Hildesheim, in what we’d call Germany today.

With shared dishes and few utensils, handwashing was important. A splendid bronze vessel also showed off your wealth and good taste. This lion draws inspiration from ancient Roman sculpture. And as in Roman times, medieval Europeans saw the lion as a symbol of strength and bravery. Lions often featured on royal and aristocratic coats of arms. And knights in medieval courtly poems were often described as “lion-hearted”.  





Frequently taking the shape of fantastic beasts, like this lion, aquamanilia were used both in liturgical hand washing rituals and as sumptuous table adornments during feasts. Popular in medieval Germany, these vessels were based on precedents from ancient Greek, Byzantine, and Islamic cultures, obtained through trade, diplomatic gifts, and wartime looting. Lions had been imported from Asia and Africa to Europe for centuries, though artists typically portrayed them in anthropomorphized ways. Here the lion’s fur and features are conveyed through delicate, sparse detail, with much of the ewer left smooth; the bronze was cast hollow, an ancient technique, for it to fulfill its function.
