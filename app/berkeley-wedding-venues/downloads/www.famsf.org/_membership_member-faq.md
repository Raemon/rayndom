  * ###  Can I share a membership with family or friends? 

Memberships are nontransferable and members must accompany their guests for all visits. Unaccompanied guests will not be able to access member benefits.

  * ###  Do I receive a discount on additional guest tickets beyond my free allotment? 

We do not offer discounts on tickets for additional guests.  





##  Member visits 

  * ###  Do members need to reserve tickets in advance? 

Advance reservations for general admission are not required. Members may visit the permanent collection anytime. Advance reservations for special exhibitions are strongly recommended, but members can also reserve tickets on-site at the membership desk at either museum.

Book tickets:

    * Online at [ticketing.famsf.org](https://ticketing.famsf.org/events)

    * By phone at 800.777.9996 (Sunday–Saturday, 9 am–9 pm)

Please note: On rare occasions, museum tickets may sell out during special events and hours of operation may change. For more information, contact [membership@famsf.org](mailto:membership@famsf.org).

  * ###  Is there a limit to the number of times members can visit for free? 

Members receive unlimited free general admission and free repeat visits to most special exhibitions at the de Young and Legion of Honor. 

  * ###  How does timed ticketing work? 

With a timed ticket, you reserve a specific time for entry into a special exhibition. There is a 30-minute grace period to enter the exhibition. Once you have entered, you are welcome to spend as long as you like within the exhibition. All special exhibition tickets include same-day access to the permanent galleries. Reentry to a special exhibition is not allowed after entrance.

Untimed special exhibitions are automatically assigned 9:30 am. You are welcome to arrive at any time during regular business hours on the date listed on your ticket.

  * ###  How do I redeem guest passes? 

Guest passes admit one for general admission at the de Young or Legion of Honor, or you can apply your guest passes toward the purchase of a special exhibition ticket. To redeem your guest passes, please visit the membership desk. Tickets are first come, first served; exclusions may apply. For questions, please call 415.750.3636 or email [membership@famsf.org](mailto:membership@famsf.org).  


  * ###  Do I need to have my membership card to visit for free?

These programs include complimentary admission at more than 1,000 museums in North America. 

To receive reciprocal admission at participating museums, please show your physical or a screenshot of your digital membership card with the NARM and WR stickers. We recommend calling the museum in advance, as the benefits each institution offers will differ.

This benefit is limited to employees of companies with a current All Access Corporate Membership or above. Email [corporategiving@famsf.org](mailto:corporategiving@famsf.org) to learn more about membership. Please note: during special events, museum tickets may sell out and hours of operation may change.
