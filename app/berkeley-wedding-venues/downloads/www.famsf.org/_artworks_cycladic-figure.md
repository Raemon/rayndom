Narrator: Curator Renee Dreyfus:

Dreyfus: _Among the earliest treasures that we have in our Ancient Art collection are these timeless Cycladic figures that you see here._

Narrator: The marble figures were made almost 5000 years ago, on the Cycladic Islands in the Aegean Sea.

Dreyfus: _And these figures probably were intended to be fertility figures of some sort. Although we don't know - it's before the time of writing. They represent the human body in its purest, pristine, compact, and essential form._

_But at one point they had paint on them and sometimes you can see traces of paint. And if the paint is gone, you can see what is called paint ghosts - the area of the marble that was protected by the color and it is less worn than the surrounding areas that did not have color, so it stands out in high relief. And these paint ghosts reveal that blue was used for eyes, eyebrows, hair, while red dots and stripes in different patterns sometimes appear on the faces of these figures, and perhaps it represents face painting or maybe even tattooing._

_Artists like Picasso, Matisse, Brancusi and others were inspired by these figures and even collected them and placed them in their studios as constant reminders of how you could create an emotionally stirring image - yet make it of abstract forms._  





Nearly five thousand years ago in the Cyclades—a cluster of islands dotting the center of the Aegean Sea—curiously modern and abstract marble figures were carved in severely simple form. These figures represent the human body in its most pure, pristine, compact, and essential shape, bearing a striking resemblance to modern works of art. The most impressive and memorable type is the canonical or folded-arm figure, carved according to strict conventions and nearly always a nude female with the left arm over the right. This figure, with its long, lyre-shaped head, a semi-conical nose, sloping shoulders, narrow arms, and rounded back without any indication of a spine has been identified as the work of an artist known as the Goulandris Master. In the 20th century, artists such as Picasso, Matisse, Brancusi, Arp, and Moore respected and collected Cycladic art as models to create emotionally stirring, yet highly abstracted, forms.
