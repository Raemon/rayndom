#  Achenbach Foundation for Graphic Arts guidelines for class visits 

##  Jump to 

  * I. Scheduling
  * II. Preparing for class visits
  * III. During class visit



##  I. Scheduling 

  * Instructors must fill out [this form](https://www.famsf.org/forms/george-roberts-seminar-room-appointment-request-form) requesting a visit with four weeks advance notice; advanced undergraduate and graduate courses that will benefit most from in-person viewing of the collection will receive priority until all available spots are filled. 
  * Due to high demand, instructors may only bring one class per semester. 
  * Classes may not exceed 12 students total. 
  * Appointments are available on Thursdays, 9.30 am to noon. They are scheduled subject to staff availability. Weekend and evening classes cannot be accommodated. 
  * Classes typically last one hour to one-and-a-half hours. Instructors must indicate duration and must not exceed this limit. 



##  II. Preparing for class visits 

  * The instructor must provide the projected number of students in the class in their initial visit request and confirm the number expected to attend at least two weeks prior to the visit. 
  * The instructor must provide a list of no more than 15 works on paper to view when they send their visit request. Please use our [collections search](/art-finder) to select artworks you wish to see. 
  * Everything on the list is subject to curatorial approval. Artworks that are oversize, unavailable, framed, or fragile may not be viewable. In these cases, a substitute of a similar work may be offered. 



##  III. During class visit 

  * The instructor will wait at the entrance to the Legion of Honor, 100 34th Avenue, to greet the class. 
  * Only once the entire class is assembled should the instructor check in with the admissions desk (who will call an Achenbach staff member). 
  * Students and instructors will be asked to wash their hands prior to entering the George and Leanne Roberts Seminar Room.
  * Visitors will be asked to leave all bags in a secure space adjacent to the Roberts Seminar Room prior to entrance. Small notebooks, paper, pencils, laptops and cameras are the only items permitted in the Roberts Seminar Room. Visitors should bring their own supplies. Photography without flash is permitted. 
  * No beverages, food, or gum are allowed in the Roberts Seminar Room; loose hanging jewelry and scarves must be removed prior to viewing the objects. 
  * No one may touch works of art without prior permission. 
  * To prevent damaging the artwork, students should sit on chairs, when available, or stand without resting on the tables and ledges. When leaning over to look closely at artworks, please prevent necklaces, hair, etc. from falling onto the works. 
  * Please be mindful of class noise levels to avoid disturbing staff working nearby.
  * While a member of the Achenbach curatorial team will be on hand to monitor visits and answer questions, it is the expectation that instructors will provide the content of the class.
