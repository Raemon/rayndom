  * ###  Transcript 

Narrator: French artist Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux made this bronze sculpture of a man around 1872. He used an unidentified model from the small Chinese community then living in Paris. Curator Jeffrey Fraiman:

Fraiman: _Part of what makes the figure feel so present, so immediate, is the sensitivity with which Carpeaux portrayed his features_.

Narrator: Jade Ichimura works in the Museums’ education department as an interpretation and outreach associate.

Ichimura: _As somebody who is Japanese American, seeing another person who also has similar features, in this museum, was an immediate point for me. When you see a bust in a museum of a non-European person from the 1800s, you'd usually expect that they would be shown in some very blatantly exoticizing way, but he doesn't really appear that way to me_. _However, when you learn more about the bronze, those narratives do come up, unfortunately._

Narrator: Carpeaux included the braid, or queue, that at this time was mandatory for all men in China.

Ichimura: _By the 19th and 20th centuries, the queue became a feature that people recognized as Chinese, and became almost a caricature for some people_.

Narrator: - and the sculpture’s title, “The Chinese Man”, seems to deny its sense of the man’s individuality. The artist sold multiple copies of this piece.

Fraiman: _The success of these compositions testified to the interest in 19th century Europe for images of the “other”._

_Carpeaux modeled this figure for a larger project, a fountain he was commissioned to make, showing the four parts of the world – this figure representing “Asia”._

Narrator: But the fountain figures were planned as women. So, having created this head using his male model, Carpeaux then attached it to a woman’s body, for the fountain’s full-length figure.
