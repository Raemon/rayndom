We are committed to offering services that make our collections, exhibitions, and programs accessible to all visitors. Programs and visiting options for individuals with disabilities as well as other underserved populations in the community are crucial for creating equity in access to the arts.

General admission to the de Young and Legion of Honor is complimentary for those who have disabilities, and includes free admission for a guest, pending availability. **Please contact**[**access@famsf.org**](mailto:access@famsf.org)**to request access tickets prior to your visit.**

Access membership ($99) is a discounted membership level for people with disabilities. Access membership includes free admission for one member, a caregiver, and a guest, invitations to Member Previews, 10% off at the de Young and Legion of Honor Museum Stores, and a subscription to our Member Monthly email newsletter and _Fine Arts_ magazine. Please contact [membership@famsf.org](mailto:membership@famsf.org) or call 415.750.3636 (Monday–Friday, 9 am–5 pm) to become a member. 

All Access programs are complimentary or provided at a low cost. Please contact us at [access@famsf.org](mailto:access@famsf.org) if you have any questions or need additional information not provided below.

##  For visitors who are Deaf, hard of hearing, or Deaf / Blind 

### **American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation**

ASL interpretation is provided at no fee for all public programs, lectures, and tours. Please contact the Access Office at least two weeks in advance of your visit. To request ASL interpretation, contact the Access Office at 415.750.7645 or [access@famsf.org](mailto:access@famsf.org).

### **American Sign Language (ASL) tactile interpretation**

Upon request, with two weeks advance notice, a specialized ASL tactile interpreter can be solicited to interpret for an individual who is Deaf / Blind.

### **Assistive listening devices**

Assistive listening devices are available for visitors who are hearing as well as hard of hearing and wear a hearing aid with a t-coil switch to use with loop, to provide greater amplification for docent led tours or lectures. Please contact [access@famsf.org](mailto:access@famsf.org) for additional information and instructions or the assistance of a visitor experience associate or volunteer.

### **Computer Activated Real-Time Transcription (CART)**

Upon request, with two weeks advance notice, CART services can be solicited to provide real-time captioning for lectures, films (if film does not have captions incorporated), and other FAMSF events.

### **Captions – open and closed**

Films produced by FAMSF will have open captions as displayed in the galleries. Films not produced by FAMSF that run for less than three months will have, at minimum, scripted text available in booklet form. Films not produced by FAMSF that run for more than three months will have captions. Films presented in the Koret Auditorium and Gunn Theater of either museum will have closed captions, available on an iPad or mobile device. Supportive devices for closed captions must be requested at least two weeks in advance.

##  For visitors who have low vision or are blind 

### **Audio tours**

Audio tours for most special exhibitions at both museums are available at exhibition entrances.

### **Braille / tactile and large-font museum guides, maps, and other access**

Museum guides and maps are available in both braille / tactile and large font for both museums. Please ask the admissions staff upon arrival. A photo ID must be provided to check out a guide or map to ensure it is returned. Braille is also available in the elevators.

### **Large print labels (LPLs)**

LPL booklets using Arial font, size 16, are available for most exhibitions. They can be found in plexiglass holders at the beginning of the exhibition. Please note that all booklets are the property of Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco and are to be returned to the holders.

Large print menus are available at the café.

### **Service / support animals**

Service / support animals are welcome at both museums, as long as they are well-behaved. Security Guards are allowed to intervene if an animal gets out of hand or is a threat to other visitors or artworks. If the service / support animal is anything other than a dog, it is recommended that you call in advance to ensure an accommodation can be made.

### **Standing closer to art policy**

For visitors who self-identify as having low vision, it is recommended that they call in advance to ensure Visitor Experience and Security staff are aware and can make an exception for them to stand closer to the art. A white cane that identifies the person as having low vision is helpful but not required. Be sure to hold on to any shoulder bags so they do not swing forward toward the artwork.

### **Gallery lighting**

Lighting in certain galleries may be dimmed in order to protect the art.

##  Language access 

### **Translators**

Visitors who have limited English proficiency (LEP) may request a docent tour in a specified language. We will attempt to provide a docent who speaks the requested language, but it is not guaranteed. At least two weeks’ notice must be given. 

##  For visitors with mobility considerations and accessible parking needs

### **Navigating the museums**

Motorized scooters are welcome in both museums. Please exercise care when scooting around art on pedestals and in cases. Wheelchairs are available from coat check or the admissions counter on a first come, first-served basis and cannot be reserved. Photo ID is required to borrow a wheelchair. Wide wheelchairs are also available. 

Lightweight, portable, and wide, sturdy stools are available at admissions and coat check. A Photo ID must be provided to ensure stools are returned prior to leaving the museum. Stools may not be reserved.

[Other powered mobility device guidelines](https://www.famsf.org/visit/other-powered-mobility-device-opmd-guidelines)

**Door access**

All doors are accessible. They are either propped open, lightweight and ADA compliant, or feature push buttons; otherwise, a security guard will be stationed at the door to assist you. At the de Young, push buttons are located at the museum entrance. At the Legion of Honor there are no push buttons. An intercom located at the north entrance can be used to alert a security guard for assistance. Both museums are wheelchair accessible by ramp or level ground. 

**Accessible bathrooms, gender-neutral bathrooms, and nursing / changing rooms**

Both museums have accessible bathrooms, gender-neutral bathrooms, and nursing / changing rooms. At the de Young the changing room is located at the emergency aid room. At the Legion of Honor the changing room is located at basement level, accessible only by staff; therefore a security guard needs to be notified that you need access.

**Backpacks**

Visitors who bring backpacks to the museums will be asked by Security staff to carry them by hand. If you are a visitor with a disability and unable to carry your backpack by hand, you can either check your backpack with coat check on the lower level or ask for a heart sticker to put on your backpack. The sticker alerts Security that you are allowed to wear your backpack on your shoulders.

##  Access program information 

### **Access Days**

Access Days allow visitors an opportunity to visit special exhibitions on select Mondays when the Museums are closed to the public. We aim to have an Access Day once during each special exhibit. Docent tours for visitors with low vision, who are Deaf and communicate via ASL interpretation, and other accommodations are available. Access Day patrons from disability and underserved communities can also self-guide and benefit from additional seating in the galleries, a less crowded experience, the availability of large print labels, the use of wheelchairs and sturdy stools, a fragrance-free environment, and additional accessible blue zone parking spaces.

Virtual artwork tours are also available through our [Art in ASL](/stories/series/art-in-asl) video series.

This is a program for people with low vision or who are blind that provides a highly descriptive tour.

##  de Young Social Story 

Plan your visit to the de Young with our Social Story. Our guide may be helpful for young visitors, those who are neurodivergent, or anyone who feels anxious about the idea of visiting a large art museum. The guide includes descriptions and pictures that show what to expect at the museum.

##  Other access information 

### **Access Advisory Board**

The Access Advisors (AA), formed in 1988, is comprised of fourteen members who have disabilities, work in the disability field, or have a family member with a disability. They work with FAMSF to help make the museums more accessible both to persons with disabilities and people who do not consider themselves as having a disability, but have vision, mobility, hearing, or stamina issues, among others. The goal of the AA is to assist the Museums to be usable and disability friendly and provide specialized services to our visitors upon request.
