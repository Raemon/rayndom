  * ###  Transcript 

Dreyfus: _I’m Renee Dreyfus – I’m curator in charge of ancient art at the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco._

Shuck: _My name is Kim Shuck - I'm a lifelong artist and poet._

Dreyfus: _This nearly life-sized stone torso is a sculpture from the reign of the great Pharaoh, Amenhotep III. And he's from Dynasty 18, which is a high point, a zenith of Egyptian art and civilization. And it's a sculpture of a god_.

Narrator: The god was probably carved for Amenhotep III's royal jubilee. Three jubilees were held during the last decade of his reign. These were intended to rejuvenate the failing powers of the aging ruler and emphasize his relationship with the gods. 

The god holds a loop-shaped ankh, symbol of life, and a scepter, representing power. And the dark color of the stone he’s carved from recalls the rich, fertile soil around the Nile, suggesting new life.

Shuck: _And that gorgeous stone, it just speaks to reverence and patience, that are present in the making as well as the looking_. _Just looking at that object, broken as it is - the residual magnificence and dignity of that piece, I think, speaks to something about awe and the way that a human body feels and experiences that kind of awe and reverence._  





Dating from the zenith of Egyptian art and civilization, this nearly life-sized torso dates to the reign of the pharaoh Amenhotep III (1390‒1352 BC) and was probably carved for his royal jubilee. Three such events, called sed-festivals, intended to rejuvenate the failing powers of the aging ruler and emphasize his relationship with the gods, were held during the last decade of his reign. For these occasions Amenhotep III commissioned his royal workshops to produce sets of divine statues placed in temples at major sites throughout Egypt and as far south as the Sudan. In this highly polished statue, the god, displaying a similar corpulence to portraits of the king, wears a pleated linen kilt. He carries in his right hand the ankh, a symbol of life, while in his left the was scepter, representing dominion. The absence of the head and an inscription makes it impossible to identify the figure.
