#  Contemporary Council 

Support the art and artists of today.

The Contemporary Council supports contemporary art and programming at the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco. Members enjoy studio visits with contemporary artists, private curatorial tours of contemporary art exhibitions, home tours of art collections, VIP access to art fairs, and more.

At both the de Young and Legion of Honor, contemporary art stands alongside our historic collections. Presented in dialogue with works from across centuries and from every corner of the globe, our contemporary program invites audiences — from first-time visitors to seasoned collectors — to see how the art and ideas of today both reflect and reframe past histories for the present moment. 

  * $5,000 Contemporary Council Friends receive:

    * Invitation for two to all upcoming Contemporary Council events and programs 

    * Individual recognition in our Donor Honor Roll and Annual Report, featured in _Fine Arts_ magazine

    * Group recognition in the “Additional Support” category on one contemporary exhibition per year as “Contemporary Council”

  * $15,000 Contemporary Council Tastemakers receive:

    * All invitations and recognition at the $5,000 level

    * Individual named recognition in the “Additional Support” category on the exhibition or program of your choice

    * Invitation to our Annual Black-Tie dinner

  * $25,000 Contemporary Council Collectors receive:

    * All invitations at the $15,000 level

    * Individual named recognition in the “Generous Support” category on the exhibition or program of your choice 

    * Invitation to annual contemporary art travel with a curator, providing access to private collections, museums, art fairs, and galleries




Members of the Contemporary Council also receive Donor Circle benefits, including invitations for two to Donor Receptions celebrating special exhibition openings, unlimited free admission for two members, five accompanied guests, and youth up to age 17 to the de Young and Legion of Honor, 10% off at the Museum Stores, and a subscription to _Fine Arts_ magazine and the Patrons Circle email newsletter.

The Contemporary Council also welcomes the vital support of businesses and companies that share our commitment to cultural innovation and the advancement of contemporary art. Corporate sponsorship provides critical funding for world-class exhibitions and offers exclusive opportunities to engage with like-minded community members and collectors through curated experiences.

Sponsors receive tailored recognition, invitations to Contemporary Council events, and the opportunity to host private gatherings with artists, curators, and museum leaders — positioning partners at the forefront of creativity and civic leadership.

Join us in supporting the next generation of art and artists. To join, or for more information, contact [csc@famsf.org](mailto:csc@famsf.org) or call 415.750.3508 (Monday–Friday, 9 am–5 pm).
