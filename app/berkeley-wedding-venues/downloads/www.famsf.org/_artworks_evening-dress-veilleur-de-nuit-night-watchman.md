#  Evening dress "Veilleur de Nuit" (Night Watchman) 

Spring/Summer 1924

[ Jeanne Lanvin ](https://www.famsf.org/art-finder?artist=286)

Not on view

Jeanne Lanvin’s robe de style evening dresses, with their tubular bodices, dropped waists, and full, ankle-length skirts (often worn with side hoops), referenced eighteenth-century fashions. This version also features elements influenced by the costumes and textiles of the Manchu-led Qing dynasty (1644–1911) of China. The appliqués are reminiscent of medallions and circular embroideries worn on court robes, and the net at the hem mimics the contrast borders that adorned nonofficial, semiformal robes from the last half of the nineteenth century.
