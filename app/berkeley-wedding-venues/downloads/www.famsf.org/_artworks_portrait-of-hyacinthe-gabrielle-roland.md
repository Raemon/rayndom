  * ###  Transcript 

Narrator: Set against a stormy sky, her hair cascading over bare shoulders, this woman is portrayed more informally than was usual in 1791. Partly that’s because she herself was unconventional. Hyacinthe Roland had been a Parisian actress. She was now a mother of several children with a British aristocrat, and not yet married to him. 

But it’s also because of the remarkable artist, Elisabeth Vigée-Le Brun. In 1791, both women were in Rome along with others fleeing the French Revolution. Back in Paris, the royal family was already in prison, awaiting execution.

Chief curator Emily Beeny:

Beeny: _The reason why Vigee needs to get out of town at the beginning of the Revolution is that she was the official painter to Queen Marie Antoinette._

_Vigée-Le Brun was the most highly paid portraitist in France in the years before the Revolution. She was a major celebrity, she was a rare female member of the French Academy. And I think was particularly good at striking up intimacies with her female sitters that allowed her to draw out individual character in a very special way_.

Narrator: Poet devorah major:

Major: _And that's really what Vigée-Le Brun was known for - she wanted to not do these stiff portraits of women, but rather to reflect the way a woman was, you know, in her truth._  _I think that that is what Vigée-Le Brun captured in this: that this woman is a free spirit._  





Vigée-Le Brun was the most successful French portraitist  
of her time and a rare woman artist in the Royal Academy. Having served as  
First Painter to the Queen Marie-Antoinette, she fled Paris at the outbreak of  
the Revolution. During her Italian exile, she painted British expatriates and  
French emigrés, among them Hyacinthe-Gabrielle Roland (1766-1816). Roland had  
been an actress in Paris before the Revolution and in Italy became the lover of  
a British aristocrat, the First Marquess Wellesley of Norragh, who paid for  
this portrait. Winsome and windswept, it exemplifies the graceful informality  
of Vigée’s Italian style.
