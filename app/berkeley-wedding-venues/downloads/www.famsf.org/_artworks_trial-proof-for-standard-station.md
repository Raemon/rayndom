#  Trial Proof for Standard Station 

1966

[ Edward Ruscha ](https://www.famsf.org/art-finder?artist=38)

Not on view

In 1966 Audrey Sabol, an art collector from Villanova, Pennsylvania, visited Ed Ruscha at his studio, where she saw the painting _Standard Station, Amarillo, Texas_ (1963). She suggested that he make the image into a print, which she would pay for in exchange for a portion of the edition. Ruscha and Sabol agreed that the Standard station image was particularly well-suited for screenprinting, and a small edition was printed in Los Angeles. _Standard Station_ is now considered one of the most iconic prints in Ruscha's printmaking oeuvre. It is one of more than 1,300 edition prints and working proofs in the Fine Arts Museums' Edward Ruscha Graphic Arts Archive, which grows annually with additional gifts from the artist as he continues to make new editions.
