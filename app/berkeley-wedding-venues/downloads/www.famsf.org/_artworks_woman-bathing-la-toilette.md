**Mary Cassatt,_Woman Bathing_ (La Toilette), 1890–91**

I find this scene of a woman bathing full of intimacy. But also privacy, as if we’ve just stumbled into her space, unsure of whether we should be here or not. The woman’s long, smooth, nude back is turned towards us, while her bottom half is covered in striped cloth — a dress undone, with sleeves dangling by her sides…

Her face is concealed — both to us and in her reflection in the mirror — bringing an air of mystery as we catch her in action, dipping her hands into the cerulean water, about to splash her face, and look up…

This is Mary Cassatt’s _Woman Bathing_ (La Toilette) from 1890–91. To me, Cassatt is most notable for her charming paintings of mothers and children, swept up in a loose, feathery style evocative of her Impressionist contemporaries. Here, however, is an example of one of her aquatints — a printmaking method reminiscent of watercolor-like effects.

Aquatints were especially popular in Japan. A year prior to making this work, Cassatt saw an exhibition of more than 700 Japanese prints in Paris. These became popular thanks to new trade links between Japan and the West in the mid-1800s, which hadn’t existed for centuries, owing to Japanese isolationism, which was a response to unfair Western trade practices. The Impressionists were especially influenced by the prints, and would draw from their cropped compositions, flat shapes, and skill with color.

Cassatt herself was a collector of Japanese prints. Looking closely at this work, we can see where she’s drawn inspiration from them. The flat-shaped jug in the foreground, the floral-patterned floor that’s tilted and slightly off-perspective, and the block colors — the dusty pink on the dress, turquoise background, and diluted umber on the cupboard.

Mary Cassatt was born in the US in 1844 to a supportive family who took her on trips to France and encouraged her art making. She arrived in Paris in 1866, and exhibited at four of the eight Impressionist exhibitions. These were organized outside of the French Royal Academy and paved the way for a new style of art.

While many male Impressionists painted landscapes or other outdoor subjects, setting up their studios outside (thanks to recent inventions like the paint tube), women were restricted. They often painted indoor scenes featuring other women, capturing the essence of what it was like to be a woman in the 19th century. And it’s this that we see in this work.

_Woman Bathing_ (La Toilette) earned Cassatt widespread acclaim. So much so that in 1976, it set the record for the highest price paid at auction for a print by an American artist, regardless of gender.  





ln 1890, Cassatt saw an impressive exhibition of more than seven hundred Japanese prints at the École des Beaux-Arts. Though she was already fascinated by Japanes art and culture, the exhibition compelled her to recognize the prints' value in her own art. Almost immediately, Cassatt embarked on an ambitious project of color aquatints based on ukiyo-e models. Working intensely over several months in 1890 and 1891, Cassatt completed a set of ten color aquatints, including Woman Bathing. The print contains a number of Japanese-inspired devices, among them unusual viewpoints, flat areas of color, strong diagonals, flattening of forms, and emphasis on pattern and line. Though it is not clear that the subject of a woman shown going about an everyday activity is borrowed from the Japanese prints of courtesans and beauties, there is no doubt that Cassatt's palette was determined by those prints. The dusty blue, pink, umber, and green tones are identical to the subdued color schemes in the eighteenth-century prints of Kitagawa Utamaro, one of Cassatt's favored influences.
