Josef Albers taught at the Bauhaus before moving to the United States and joining the faculty at Black Mountain College, where his students included Ruth Asawa and Robert Rauschenberg. He was also a prolific abstract artist, perhaps best known for his 1950s series of paintings Homage to the Square, in which he examined the relationship between colors by painting squares of different hues nested one on top of another. In 1962 he extended this chromatic exploration into print in this portfolio of screenprints, in which Albers layered bright, opaque color ink, the hues of each square changing at the areas where they intersect.
