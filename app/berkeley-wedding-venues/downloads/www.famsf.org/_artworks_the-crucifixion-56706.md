  * ###  Transcript 

Narrator: Medieval Christian church paintings helped focus worshippers’ prayers, and told stories – especially important when most people couldn’t read. 

In this Italian painting, figures around the crucified Christ react with strong emotion. To the left, Christ’s mother Mary, dressed in blue, faints in distress. Curator Isabella Lores-Chavez: 

Isabella Lores-Chavez: _And behind her is one of the most expressive figures in the whole composition - this figure of Mary Magdalene with her arms raised in despair. She's really conveying such suffering and such anguish._

Narrator: Real gold leaf is used for haloes and background. Imagine how it would’ve gleamed in the candlelight. 

Isabella Lores-Chavez: _The gold really serves to create a sense of this very precious spiritual depiction_. 

Narrator: Even more expensive would have been the lapis lazuli stone used to create the brilliant blue of Mary’s robe. 

Isabella Lores-Chavez: _And lapis lazuli came from Afghanistan and from other parts of Central Asia. So it's a really great reminder of how interconnected Europe was with other parts of the world already in the Middle Ages_. 

Narrator: The painting was originally part of a much bigger altarpiece. Made of many different panels, its smaller scenes helped illustrate Christ’s life - a bit like a graphic novel sequence.  





Luca di Tommè worked prolifically after the first outbreak of the plague in Siena, producing devotional images for a decimated population in mourning. This painting was once the central scene in the lower portion of an altarpiece. Preserving conventions developed by the previous generation of Sienese painters, Luca emphasized his figures’ emotions through expressive gestures. Mary Magdalene, for example, raises her arms in anguish at the sight of Christ crucified. Supple contours and delicate shadows articulate the musculature of his body, isolated against the gold ground. Gold leaf accents throughout and fine punchwork patterns reflect the local taste for surface ornamentation.
