Along the Karawari (Korewori) River, a tributary of the Sepik River, figures known as _yipwon_ are found in the back of men’s ceremonial houses. These supremely powerful carvings of ancestral spirits can be called up to assist with warfare, head- hunting, and big-game hunting of wild boar, cassowary birds, and other creatures of the forest. The _yipwon_ spirits, once their images were anointed and activated with offerings, collected food and hunted the prey in advance of a hunting party. They deposited all the food in the vicinity of people’s homes. Upon returning from a hunting expedition, ritual offerings were made to the successful _yipwon_ , and some figures were adorned with paint. Figures considered not helpful were left unattended, yet kept in the men’s house (Haberland and Seyfarth 1974, 365–370; Meyer 1995, 235).

Each _yipwon_ has its own name, which may indicate a relationship to a specific ancestor. _Yipwon_ are often kept for generations as the property of clans or families, while much smaller ones are individually owned as amulets. In Melanesian pidgin they were also called _wanleks_ , referring to their single leg (Friede 2005, 125).

_Yipwon_ figures are formed of echoing inward-curving hooks representing ribs surrounding the heart, a single straight projection in the center, and a bent leg extending from the abstracted body. The head is quite naturalistic and emphasized as the most spiritually important part of the body.
