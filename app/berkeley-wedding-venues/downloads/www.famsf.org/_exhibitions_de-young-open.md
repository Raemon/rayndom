October 10, 2020 – January 31, 2021

In celebration of the de Young museum’s 125th anniversary, the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco are hosting  _The de Young Open_ , a juried community art exhibition of submissions by artists who live in the nine Bay Area counties: Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, Napa, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Solano, and Sonoma.  
  
Works of art in  _The de Young Open_ are hung “salon-style,” installed edge to edge and floor to ceiling, which enables a maximum number of works to be displayed. The de Young filled the 12,000-square-foot Herbst Exhibition Galleries with 877 artworks by [762 Bay Area artists](/storage/files/90672dd5-8cae-47cb-8673-9da60fec2029/mar_20_tdyo_list_of_artists_poster_r8.pdf) in  _The de Young Open_.

_The de Young Open_ continues the museum’s long-standing tradition of engaging the local community and showcasing the talent of Bay Area artists, who offer their pieces for sale and retain 100 percent of the proceeds. Access _The de Young Open_ Web Gallery to explore artworks in the exhibition. You will find instructions for purchase on this site. If you have any questions, please refer to our FAQ.

 _Please note that you are exiting deyoung.famsf.org, and are entering a third-party website. Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco are not responsible for any sales transactions._

## In depth

In March, following the unexpected closure of the Fine Arts Museums, _The de Young Open_ and a call for submissions were announced and, beginning in June, local artists were encouraged to submit recent or newly created work to the exhibition through an online portal. An impressive 11,514 artworks submitted by 6,188 artists from across the nine Bay Area counties.  
  
Every artwork image was reviewed anonymously multiple times by a group of qualified jurors who did not know the identities of the artists. The jurors included four Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco curators in charge and three prominent Bay Area artists: Mildred Howard, Hung Liu, and Enrique Chagoya. Given the space limitations in our main exhibition galleries, the seven jurors were faced with the challenging task of selecting and accepting less than 8 percent of all the works submitted.  
  
The Museums want to thank every artist who submitted works for enriching the Bay Area’s cultural landscape, as well as that of the United States. The Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco would not exist without the talented artists whose works make our very existence possible.  
  
We promise to carry on the mission of engaging with our local artistic communities through projects like  _The de Young Open_ , and look forward to welcoming artists — and all of our community members — back to the de Young as soon as it is safe to gather again in person.
