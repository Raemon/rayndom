  * ###  Transcript 

Narrator: This winged genius, or genie, was carved almost 3000 years ago. It was made for the palace of Ashurnasirpal II, king of the mighty Assyrian Empire. Today, the empire would include Iraq, parts of Iran, Kuwait, Syria and Turkey. 

An Assyrian genie was believed to have magical powers. Curator Renee Dreyfus:

Dreyfus: _It protected the king from any diseases, ill fortune - and even death._ _Ashurnasirpal II lavished great attention on his royal palace in Nimrud, which was his capital city._

Narrator: The genie’s magnificent wings are matched by his skillfully carved curled hair, beard and jewelry. He would originally have been one of a pair of genies, guarding an image of the king in a royal audience chamber.

Below are intricately carved ivory plaques. They were found in the palace that belonged to Ashurnasirpal's son, also in Nimrud. Most would have been used to decorate wooden furniture such as thrones. 

Dreyfus: _Both unworked and carved ivories were thought of as precious substances, and they were highly prized._ _The ivories were often painted and inlaid in color and sometimes overlaid with gold._

Narrator: The carvings were made by artists who came from Syria and Phoenicia - today’s Lebanon. These were then part of the Assyrian empire.

Dreyfus: _So these artists created plaques that borrowed heavily from Egyptian art - you can see that here, and especially where it depicts fantastic composite animals and floral settings._  





The mighty Assyrian empire dominated the Near East from Iran to Egypt from 883 to 626 BC, and its art, which ranks as one of the finest achievements of the ancient Mesopotamian world, exercised an important influence on the art of other cultures. Imposing relief sculpture, like this protective spirit from the walls of the palace of King Ashurnasirpal II, defined the classical style of the ancient Near East. Ashurnasirpal II lavished great attention on his royal palace, which was decorated with carved and painted stone reliefs illustrating historical narratives of the might and invincibility of Assyria. Other slabs had a religious or magical function. In this relief, a guardian divinity, or genius, protects the king, whose image originally stood between two winged figures. The idealized and highly political art of the Assyrians depicted the king and the human and divine members of his court with calm and dignity, since they symbolized Assyrian supremacy.
