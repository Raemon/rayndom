Thank you for including the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco in your curriculum planning. We look forward to welcoming all students, youth, and educators into the museums.

We are excited to provide a space for curiosity, collaboration, and learning for the 2025–2026 academic year. Requests will be confirmed as space permits. To avoid scheduling conflicts, all school and youth groups are required to submit a request form. Unregistered groups will not be guaranteed entry or free admission.

##  Self-guided field trips 

We offer free admission for students and chaperones for all self-guided field trips to the de Young and Legion of Honor. When making a reservation, please provide four weeks advance notice. To request your visit, please complete [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfabKfpZIOZ0__zAG3jEiMfLF9sFGY3u_2NzMy_CcgwyCNtNA/viewform?usp=sharing&ouid=107799339602902130901).

Note: We are no longer able to accommodate anymore field trips to _Art of Manga_. We are happy to have been able to serve over 3,000 students during the run of this exhibition.

##  Guided field trips 

We are no longer accepting applications for our [Get Smart with Art](/education/get-smart-with-art) guided field trip program for the 2025–26 academic year.

##  FAQ 

  * ###  When can I schedule a visit? 

Self-guided visits are available for booking on Tuesdays from 1:00 pm to 4:00 pm and Wednesdays through Sundays from 9:30 am to 4:00 pm. Get Smart with Art guided visits are only scheduled for Tuesday mornings.  


  * ###  How many chaperones are required? 

We ask all groups to at least have one adult for every 10 students.  


  * ###  What if I have a large group? 

We require groups larger than 30 students to split into smaller groups and follow their assigned staggered entry to avoid crowding at the entrance and in the galleries. Staggered entry requires a minimum of 15 minutes in between each small group and serves as the group’s entry into the entire museum. Early entry is not allowed.  


  * ###  How should I prepare my group for our field trip? 

To prepare for your visit, please review our [educator resources](/education/resources-for-educators) and [school group visit guide](https://famsf.art/school-group-guide), also available in [Español](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fZSqOVcynKvAFcXky3T7-wYiVEX6cqbDGIkkpYI9hsc/edit?slide=id.p1#slide=id.p1).  


  * ###  What do we do when we arrive at the museum? 

Upon arrival, the group leader should instruct the group to wait outside while they retrieve the tickets for the group at the admissions desk by providing the attendant with the school name and order number. All adults and students must wear an admission sticker in a visible spot throughout their visit.  


  * ###  Where can students store their backpacks, lunches, etc.? 

Museum staff can provide storage bins to store students' belongings. Teachers and chaperones are also encouraged to use the storage bin as all backpacks must be held by their side, by the handle. Teachers with medical emergency equipment in the backpacks, may request a “heart tag” from the security officer at the entrance.  


  * ###  Where can we eat lunch? 

Students may eat their lunches in the surrounding park areas. Students may not eat their lunches in the Museum Café, outside patio or sculpture garden.  


  * ###  What if it is raining? 

The museum does not have an indoor lunch area in the event of inclement weather. If you would like to cancel your visit as a result, please contact [schoolgroups@famsf.org](mailto:schoolgroups@famsf.org).  


  * ###  Can the group exit and re-enter the museum? 

Yes, groups can exit and reenter the museum throughout the day. Please ensure everyone in the group still has their admission sticker visible while at the museum.  


  * ###  What if we arrive early or late? 

If you anticipate an early or late arrival, please reach out to [schoolgroups@famsf.org](mailto:schoolgroups@famsf.org) or call our School Tours office at 415.750.7696. Other groups may be impacted by your new arrival time.
