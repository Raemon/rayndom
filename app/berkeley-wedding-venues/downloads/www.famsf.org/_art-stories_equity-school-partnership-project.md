##  About 

Through our Equity School Partnership Project (ESPP), we work hand in hand with community-based artists, museum educators, and K–5 teachers and students to co-develop customized arts curricula and programming. The goal of ESPP is to create an experience that:

  * Centers students
  * Is culturally responsive
  * Supports social emotional learning (SEL) 
  * Builds community



The eight-week program includes:

  * A two-day curriculum-planning workshop at the de Young, where you will view the galleries and special exhibitions (alongside museum staff and a community artist)
  * Seven in-class art sessions (60–90 minutes) at the school site (all art material included)
  * One free museum field trip with customized art instruction and guided gallery tours (with free transportation to and from the de Young and / or Legion of Honor) 



All ESPP students, teachers, and families are invited to participate in [de Youngsters Day Out](/giving/de-youngsters-day-out), our annual youth and family event (with free transportation included to and from the de Young).

##  Feedback from teachers + students 

> The de Young’s Equity School Partnership Program has brought just that to the 2nd-graders at Tenderloin Community School! The program has brought experiences, resources, and instruction that would otherwise be unavailable to my students. Through the program my students have been able to learn from an artist in their community, to sew, and to photograph the beauty of their neighborhood. Each week students were eager for their time with the de Young artists. It easily became the most engaging aspect of our week. The artists and staff interacted with students with kindness, excitement, and academic rigor. We are so grateful for the opportunity to partner with this program.

> The Equity School Partnership Project (ESPP) is a remarkable endeavor that not only provides vital in-classroom resources but also fosters a sense of community and collaboration among students and their families through the medium of art. ESPP’s ability to seamlessly integrate classroom learning with creative expression allows students to create meaningful projects, such as a collaborative book my students were able to do, while events like de Youngsters Day Out provide a platform for parents to share in their children’s educational journey, making it an enriching experience for all.

> ESPP was a wonderful experience for myself, students, and families! From collaborating with a local artist in the classroom to visiting the deYoung (for some students it was their first time in San Francisco!). Students truly had an opportunity to immerse themselves in the world of art and connect their art pieces back to their community.
