#  Study of Isadora Duncan 

1915

[ Abraham Walkowitz ](https://www.famsf.org/art-finder?artist=1603)

Not on view

Born in San Francisco, Isadora Duncan was a pioneer of modern dance. Rejecting traditional dance forms and attire, she wore flowy garments, left her hair loose and her feet bare, and moved with naturalism. As a performer and teacher, Duncan had a profound influence on the history of dance, including on the work of Mikhail Fokine and Léon Bakst of the Ballets Russes, who saw her perform in Russia in 1904 and 1905. Abraham Walkowitz captured her dynamic and improvisational movement in these watercolor studies of the dancer, whose life was cut short in an accident in 1927.
