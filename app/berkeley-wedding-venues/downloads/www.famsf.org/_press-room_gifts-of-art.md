SAN FRANCISCO, Nov 4, 2025 — The Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco (the “Fine Arts Museums”), comprising the de Young and the Legion of Honor, today announced the completion of a multiyear Gifts of Art campaign that has strengthened every curatorial area of the permanent collection. Gifts of Art garnered more than 2,000 outstanding gifts from 275 donors, far surpassing its preliminary goal, embodying the generous Bay Area spirit that has underpinned the evolution of the Fine Arts Museums’ collections since their founding.

In his first major campaign as Director and CEO of the Fine Arts Museums, Thomas P. Campbell initiated a call in 2022 for 100 transformative gifts of art to commemorate two momentous anniversaries. The first of these was the 50th anniversary of the creation of the Fine Arts Museums. In 1972, the city charter joined the de Young and Legion of Honor museums under one governance with a new name, creating the largest public arts institution in Northern California.

Gifts of Art also aimed to build excitement for the [**Legion of Honor 100**](https://www.famsf.org/press-room/institutional-newslegion-100). The Legion of Honor first opened its doors to the San Francisco public on November 11, 1924, and has since evolved into a beloved center for scholarship and presentation of European paintings, decorative arts, sculpture, and art of the ancient Mediterranean. It is also home to the Achenbach Foundation for Graphic Arts, one of the largest collections of prints, drawings, photographs, and artist-illustrated books in the United States.

> “The Gifts of Art campaign is a significant milestone in the history of the Fine Arts Museums and I am humbled and inspired by the exceptional generosity of donors set on a common goal: to make extraordinary works of art accessible to our creative, curious, and engaged Bay Area audiences,” said Thomas P. Campbell, Director and CEO of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco. “The succession of two landmark anniversaries offered opportunities to reflect on the distinct identities and strengths of our collections—and the profound legacy of the thousands of steadfast supporters who have helped shape them over the years with generous donations of art”

Gifts of Art aimed to engage both longtime supporters as well as a new generation of civic-minded philanthropists. The call to action to grow the Fine Arts Museums’ collection, enabling its mission to connect audiences with local and global art, was enthusiastically answered. The impressive number of gifts comprises both outright and promised gifts from private collections as well as gracious donations that allowed the Fine Arts Museums to nimbly acquire outstanding artworks on the market.

Diane B. Wilsey, chair emerita, generously funded the acquisition of **Canaletto** ’s stunning [**_Venice, the Grand Canal looking East with Santa Maria della Salute_**](https://www.famsf.org/press-room/fine-arts-museums-of-san-francisco-acquire-rare-work-by-canaletto), before its planned auction at Christie's in 2022. This dazzling painting will be on view this spring at the de Young in the upcoming exhibition [_Monet and Venice_](https://www.famsf.org/exhibitions/monet-venice) _._

Transformative to the substantial collection of works on paper held by the Achenbach Foundation for Graphic Arts at the Fine Arts Museums, local collector Kirk Edward Long’s gift of **1,600 European Master prints** is one of the largest single-owner donation of prints received by the Achenbach Foundation since its founding in 1948, and recharacterizes the Achenbach Foundation as a leading repository for European prints, particularly strong in its Mannerist holdings. The Long Collection, one of the largest of 16th century prints in the US, includes preeminent examples of early modern European printmaking from the regions of Italy, France, Germany, and the low countries. In addition, a selection of European paintings, decorative arts, and Roman antiquities were donated by Mr. Long.

Through the generosity of an anonymous benefactor the Achenbach Foundation received gifts or promised gifts of outstanding and transformative masterpieces on paper by****[**Mary Cassatt**](https://www.famsf.org/artworks/a-kiss-for-baby-ann-no-3), **Jean-Antoine Watteau** and **Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec.** Another significant addition — [**Henri Matisse’s _Jazz_**](https://www.famsf.org/exhibitions/matisse-jazz-unbound), the culmination of the artist’s graphic oeuvre — was underwritten by Margaret Hearst and her husband, former Acquisitions Committee Chair Will Hearst.   
  
The Fine Arts Museums are grateful to donors who made the acquisition of significant works by women artists possible, allowing for a fuller and more inclusive narrative of European art history to be shared with museum visitors. These include paintings by****[**Lavinia Fontana**](https://www.famsf.org/press-room/lavinia-fontana-acquisition)**,** [**Angelica Kauffman**](https://www.famsf.org/press-room/fine-arts-museums-of-san-francisco-acquisitions-celebrate-women-artists-across-centuries), and [**Marie-Guillemine Benoist**](https://www.famsf.org/press-room/rare-painting-by-groundbreaking-french-artist-marie-guillemine-benoist-acquired-by-the-fine-arts-museums-of-san-francisco), and works on paper by [**Elisabeth Louise Vigée‑LeBrun**](https://www.famsf.org/artworks/the-little-eugene-de-montesquiou-fezensac-asleep). 

Notably, Gifts of Art was instrumental in growing the Fine Arts Museums’ newest curatorial department, contemporary art, which will celebrate its own landmark 10-year anniversary in 2026. Over the course of this campaign, the department was able to acquire [42 works by local contemporary artists](https://www.famsf.org/press-room/major-new-acquisition-funded-by-svane-family-foundation-fosters-bay-area-arts-community) thanks to a million-dollar gift from the Svane Family Foundation, affirming the Fine Arts Museums’ long-standing commitment to Bay Area artists.

Further, the campaign was distinguished by the donors who gave generously, directly from their own collections. Among this special group are [Bernard and Barbro Osher](https://www.famsf.org/press-room/fine-arts-museums-of-san-francisco-announce-promised-gift-of-the-bernard-and-barbro-osher-collection-of-american-art), whose promised gift of sixty-one works by preeminent American artists, including **Georgia O’Keeffe, Winslow Homer,** and **John Singer Sargent** , have deepened the Fine Arts Museums’ representation of American art. Similarly, J. Alec Merriam, a former acquisitions committee member, and his wife, Gail, gave more than 140 works of **ancestral Maya art** to the Arts of Africa, Oceania, and the Americas department, making it one of the largest collections of ancient American art in the western United States. 

To close out the Gifts of Art campaign, earlier this year, noted San Francisco gallerist John Berggruen generously promised his **Frida Kahlo** portrait of Mrs. Jean Wight to the collection. Painted by Kahlo while she was living in San Francisco, this resonant portrait will be the first painting by the celebrated artist to enter the Fine Arts Museums’ collection and will delight future generations of museum visitors.

**Gifts of Art in the Museum Galleries**  
  
Visitors are invited to explore _Gifts of Art_ works on view in the permanent collections of the Legion of Honor and de Young museums. A multilingual audio tour, part of an expanded interpretation initiative supported by [Google.org](https://www.google.org/), is available in Spanish, Mandarin, Cantonese, and English, reflecting some of the most widely spoken languages in San Francisco. Multilingual in-gallery texts offer additional context for both new and returning visitors to the Legion of Honor, situating the works within the complex social and historical settings in which they were created.

**A Closer Look: Gifts of Art Lecture and Publication**

Director and CEO Thomas P. Campbell will give an overview of the civic philanthropic legacy of the museums and the Gifts of Art collection in the popular **A Closer Look Lecture** series at the Legion of Honor on Saturday, November 8 at 1 pm ([more information here](https://www.famsf.org/events/closer-look-gifts-art)). A publication produced by the Fine Arts Museums— _Gifts of Art to the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco,_ commemorating highlights of the campaign will be available for purchase in December 2025.

About the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco**

The Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, comprising the de Young in Golden Gate Park and the Legion of Honor in Lincoln Park, is the largest public arts institution in San Francisco.

The de Young museum originated from the 1894 California Midwinter International Exposition in Golden Gate Park. In 2025, the Fine Arts Museums celebrate the 20th anniversary of the present copper-clad landmark building, designed by Herzog & de Meuron. Reflecting an active conversation among cultures, perspectives, and time periods, the collections on view at the de Young include American painting, sculpture, and decorative arts from the 17th to the 21st centuries; arts of Africa, Oceania, and the Americas; costume and textile arts; and international modern and contemporary art.  
  
The Legion of Honor was modeled after the neoclassical Palais de la Légion d’Honneur in Paris. The museum, designed by George Applegarth, opened in 1924 on a bluff in Lincoln Park overlooking the Golden Gate. It offers unique insight into the art historical, political, and social movements of the previous 6,000 years of human history, with holdings including ancient art from the Mediterranean basin; European painting, sculpture, and decorative arts; and the largest collection of works on paper in the American West.

The Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco are located on land unceded by the Ramaytush Ohlone, who are the original inhabitants of what is now the San Francisco Peninsula. The greater Bay Area is also the ancestral territory of other Ohlone peoples, as well as the Miwok, Yokuts, and Patwin. We acknowledge, recognize, and honor the Indigenous ancestors, elders, and descendants whose nations and communities have lived in the Bay Area over many generations and continue to do so today. We respect the enduring relationships that exist between Indigenous peoples and their homelands.
