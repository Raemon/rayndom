  * ###  Transcript 

Narrator: It’s probably safe to say that most of us can’t imagine living with an enormous, elaborate piece of furniture like this. And that’s the point. It wasn’t made to fit in with everyday life. It was designed to astound those who saw it with its magnificence, and to convey messages about regal power and purpose.

The scene on the upper right, topped by a wide arch, shows rulers from the Hebrew Bible: King Solomon, famous for his wisdom, greeting the Queen of Sheba. In the center is David, Israelite hero and King, with his enemy Goliath’s head underfoot. These illustrations of royal strength and good judgment are one hint that the cabinet was created for a royal patron. 

Another clue is the cabinet’s extremely costly craftsmanship and materials. It’s made from ebony, probably brought to Europe from India. As well as the intricate exterior carvings, it has a lavish interior decorated with colorful semi-precious stones, and drawers for holding valuable documents and objects.

The cabinet was made by Pierre Gole, furniture maker to the French court, around 1650. France had then been without a ruling King for sixteen years, since the death of Louis XIII. His widow, Anne, took power until her young son Louis XIV came of age – and it was a challenging time. So this opulent cabinet, with its scenes of royal power and status – including the portrayal of a biblical queen - may well have been made for Anne herself.  





Members of the seventeenth-century French court commissioned elaborate ebony cabinets on matching stands as symbols of power and taste. Ebony, often imported from India, was considered exotic and precious and was used for the most prestigious pieces of furniture. This cabinet is carved with biblical scenes and figures intended to reflect the notion of good government as defined by the ancient kings of Israel. The two main doors open to reveal a theatrical tableau in which gilt-bronze statuettes enact the Judgment of Solomon, the ultimate story of royal wisdom. The interior of the cabinet contains more than thirty drawers, some of which are concealed behind decorative panels.
