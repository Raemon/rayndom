Among the Dayak, persons of high rank owned highly elaborated work boards and rattan burden-baskets that utilized a decorated wooden slat. The addition of a slat strengthened these baskets and increased its load capacity. The design and shape of these carriers are similar to a modern backpack, distributing weight evenly while allowing full use of the wearer's hands. Perforations along the side of this board show that it was a work board that served as the “spine” of a burden-basket as opposed to a work board placed on a lap.  
  
The interior of Borneo abounds with rivers and dense forests of filtered light where it was believed Dayak spirits dwelled and shape-shifted. If not properly appeased these spirits could create havoc. The designs on this board—a monstrous central face (hudo) surrounded by dragon-dogs (aso)—are depictions of supernatural beasts that protected against malevolent forces and physical dangers along forested pathways, or while one worked outside of the village's longhouse. They reflect a world where temporal and mythic realities were seamlessly intertwined.
