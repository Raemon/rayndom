#  The Long Gloves 

1886

[ Mary Cassatt ](https://www.famsf.org/art-finder?artist=11)

#  Artwork Viewer 

Not on view

Mary Cassatt captures the concentration of a young woman pulling on a pair of diaphanous gloves. As if transfixed, the sitter averts the viewer’s gaze, instead admiring the fabric encasing her soft arms. Cassat’s adept handling of the pastel is sensitive, but immediate, conveying the translucence of the fabric through loose, energetic strokes of cerulean blue. This color, which is plucked directly from Edgar Degas’ identifiable palette, is a testament to the artistic borrowing and exchange that occurred between the two artists for nearly four decades.
