#  Latona Giving Birth to Apollo and Diana on the Island of Delos (after a painting by Giulio Romano)

Reproductive engraver, Diana Mantovana (the daughter of a sculptor, hence known in the twentieth century as Scultori) created this engraving after a painting by Giulio Romano that was originally conceived for the Gonzaga Ducal Palace in Mantua. The unusual subject appears with some variations in several mythological sources: Juno, jealous of Jupiter's relationship with Latona, drove the pregnant woman from place to place until Neptune created for her the wooded island of Delos, where she could deliver her twins in peace. Latona reclines under an improvised tent at the center of the composition attended by five women, one washing the infant Diana in the foreground, another on the left hiding the infant Apollo. The threat of Juno's appearance accounts for the furtive aspect of the scene.
