## Answers to your common questions

Wheeled vehicles (bikes, skateboards, scooters) are not allowed in any of the Gardens. Bike racks are available near the entrances to all gardens for visitors to use with a self provided lock.

### Are strollers allowed?

Strollers are **not** allowed inside the Conservatory of Flowers and may be parked outside the Conservatory on the grass.

Strollers are **not** recommended in the Japanese Tea Garden due to narrow pathways and bridges throughout the garden.
