## Accessibility

### Parking

Handicap-accessible parking spots are available on[ Martin Luther King Jr. Drive, Nancy Pelosi Drive, and Bowling Green Drive.](https://sfrecpark.org/1618/Getting-to-Golden-Gate-Park-by-Car) [The Bandshell All-Accessible Lot](https://sfrecpark.org/1618/Getting-to-Golden-Gate-Park-by-Car), located near the Japanese Tea Garden and San Francisco Botanical Garden has 20 accessible spaces, including four van-accessible spaces. The Bandshell All-Accessible Lot is also next to a [Golden Gate Park Shuttle](https://sfrecpark.org/1617/Golden-Gate-Park-Free-Shuttle) stop for access to the Conservatory of Flowers.

### Inside the Gardens

**The Conservatory of Flowers** is wheelchair accessible for both motorized and non-motorized chairs. We also have two non-motorized wheelchairs in the ticket booth, which visitors may use (*at their own risk) on a first-come, first-served basis. The closest handicap-accessible parking spots are available on Nancy Pelosi Drive and Bowling Green Drive.

**The Japanese Tea Garden** has limited wheelchair-accessible pathways. Handicap-accessible parking spots are available in the Bandshell All-Accessible Lot and along Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive.

**San Francisco Botanical Garden** has accessible pathways throughout the garden and our ADA-accessible restroom is located next to the Friend (North) Gate on Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive, just steps away from the Japanese Tea Garden. We have a limited number of wheelchairs to lend on a first come first serve basis. Handicap-accessible parking spots are available in the Bandshell All-Accessible Lot and along Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive.

The Gardens of Golden Gate Park is committed to ensuring accessibility to everybody. If you or a  
member of your party requires accommodations, please contact us at info@gggp.org or by phone at  
415-592-4511 before your visit to discuss your needs (please note that making your request at least 5  
business days before your visit will help ensure availability).  


**Caregivers:**  
A professional or family caregiver accompanying a visitor with disabilities will receive complimentary  
Garden admission.  


**Service animals:**  
Service animals are permitted throughout the Gardens. Service and support animals must, remain under  
control, and on leash or in a carrier unless free movement is required for service. Pets, including dogs,  
are not allowed in the Gardens.  


**Mobility Aids:**  
Mobility aids for those with disabilities are welcome at all Gardens, although due to the historic nature  
of the Gardens, some areas are not wheelchair accessible. Any Power-Driven Mobility Device, such as electric wheelchairs,  
must be operated at a speed of surrounding pedestrian traffic.  


**Strollers:**  
The Botanical Garden welcomes and is a great place for strollers with ample well paved paths. Do note there are lots of stairways and unpaved paths that are not accessible for strollers. We ask guests at the Conservatory of Flowers and at the Japanese Tea Garden to park their strollers  
because of the narrow paths and spaces in these Gardens.
