Gardens of Golden Gate Park is a public/private partnership between the San Francisco Recreation & Park Department and the San Francisco Botanical Garden Society (a nonprofit 501c3 organization doing business as the “Gardens of Golden Gate Park”) to jointly operate the Conservatory of Flowers, Japanese Tea Garden, and San Francisco Botanical Garden.

### Land acknowledgement

We acknowledge that the Gardens of Golden Gate Park sit on the unceded ancestral homeland of the Ramaytush Ohlone who are the original peoples of the San Francisco Peninsula. We recognize that we benefit from living and working on their traditional homeland, and we affirm their sovereign rights as first peoples. Dedicated to connecting people to plants, the planet, and each other, the Gardens uphold the significance of this cherished and revered place that celebrates Earth’s biological diversity in supporting the health and wellbeing of all people and the planet.

## Historical milestones

1700s 

Prior to the arrival of the Spanish in 1769, the Ramaytush Ohlone, a part of a larger group of the Ohlone/Costanoan peoples, lived in the area of the San Francisco Bay south to Monterey.

1870 

Golden Gate Park is created on 1,013 acres of windswept sand dunes and a site is included for a conservatory by surveyor, designer, and first Superintendent William Hammond Hall.

1878 

![](/assets/images/graphics/timeline-icon-cof.svg)

The Park Commission formally accepts the donation of the James Lick conservatories and hires Lord and Burnham to build the Conservatory.

1879 

![](/assets/images/graphics/timeline-icon-cof.svg)

The Conservatory opens as Golden Gate Park’s first formal structure.

1883 

![](/assets/images/graphics/timeline-icon-cof.svg)

A fire destroys the Conservatory’s central dome and many exotic plants. Charles Crocker donates $10,000 since no public funds are available. The dome is raised by six feet.

1886 

John McLaren is hired as head gardener — and later superintendent — of Golden Gate Park which becomes his lifelong work and legacy.

1893 

![](/assets/images/graphics/timeline-icon-jtg.svg)

“The Japanese Village and Tea Garden” is created by George Turner Mash as a feature of the California Midwinter International Exposition. Doors open on December 27, 1893 and the Midwinter Fair holds its grand opening on January 27, 1894.

1894 

![](/assets/images/graphics/timeline-icon-jtg.svg)

The Board of Park Commissioners pay $4,500 for Marsh’s “The Japanese Village and Tea Garden” concession. The garden closes for a remodel for several months.

1894 

![](/assets/images/graphics/timeline-icon-jtg.svg)

Marsh hires Makoto Hagiwara, a successful businessman who oversaw the production of silk in Japan and a restaurant and gardening business in the U.S., as caretaker of the garden. Hagiwara is then hired by the San Francisco Board of Park Commissioners to run the garden.

1895 

![](/assets/images/graphics/timeline-icon-jtg.svg)

Hagiwara expands the garden south with two new ponds and new pathways. The garden reopens in the Spring of 1895 as the “Japanese Tea Garden”.

1901 

![](/assets/images/graphics/timeline-icon-jtg.svg)

Changes to the city charter including a provision that excludes non-citizens from employment with the city of San Francisco are introduced by Mayor James Phelan. As a result, Walter Martin of the Board of Park Commissioners is appointed to take charge of the affairs of the Japanese Tea Garden in place of Makoto Hagiwara.

1903 

![](/assets/images/graphics/timeline-icon-jtg.svg)

Hagiwara opens a new Japanese Village at the old Olympic Athletic Club grounds just outside of Golden Gate Park on H street (now Lincoln) between 7th and 8th avenues.

1906 

![](/assets/images/graphics/timeline-icon-cof.svg)

In the aftermath of the San Francisco earthquake, the Conservatory grounds become Refugee Camp No. 7, housing homeless with more than one thousand temporary tents.

1906 

![](/assets/images/graphics/timeline-icon-jtg.svg)

Park commissioners authorize superintendent John McLaren to rent out the Japanese Tea Garden privilege. He rents to Makoto Hagiwara for $50 a month. Makoto continues to operate the Japanese Village on H street as well. He manages both spaces until late 1909.

1910 

![](/assets/images/graphics/timeline-icon-jtg.svg)

Hagiwara builds a family home in the Japanese Tea Garden. It has 10-17 rooms including a banquet room that could seat 200 guests.

1913

Shinto Shrine and Torii Gate are added to the top of the hill at the Japanese Tea Garden.

A second fire damages the Conservatory, resulting in the partial collapse of the glass roof and damage to the Potting Room. 

1930 

![](/assets/images/graphics/timeline-icon-sfbg.svg)

San Francisco Botanical Garden at Strybing Arboretum breaks ground thanks to a bequest from Helene Strybing, to establish an arboretum and botanical garden in Golden Gate Park.

1937 

![](/assets/images/graphics/timeline-icon-sfbg.svg)

Eric Walther is appointed by John McLaren to be the Botanical Garden’s first director and remains in the position for 20 years. Construction and planting is supported with the help of the Works Progress Administration (WPA), a federal program designed to provide jobs for unemployed workers during the Great Depression.

1940 

![](/assets/images/graphics/timeline-icon-sfbg.svg)

The Botanical Garden officially opens to the public as “Strybing Arboretum”, an arboretum and botanical garden featuring plants from around the world and the first cup and saucer magnolia tree (_Magnolia campbellii_) of its kind in the U.S.

1942 

![](/assets/images/graphics/timeline-icon-jtg.svg)

The Board of Park Commissioners take over management of the Japanese Tea Garden as the Hagiwara family is forced, along with approximately 120,000 Japanese Americans, into incarceration camps.

1942 

![](/assets/images/graphics/timeline-icon-jtg.svg)

The Board of Park Commissioners order that the word ‘Japanese’ be removed from all signs. The garden will be known simply as the “Tea Garden”. They hire Cleveland Wrecking Company to demolish the Hagiwara family home and remove the Shinto shrine, aviary, and second tea house.

1943 

![](/assets/images/graphics/timeline-icon-jtg.svg)

The Sunken Garden is designed in the place of the former Hagiwara family home by Central California Construction Company.
