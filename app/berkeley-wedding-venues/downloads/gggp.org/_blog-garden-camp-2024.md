# Garden Camp is back for an exciting summer of outdoor fun and learning!

April 25, 2024

## Join our popular all-outdoor Garden Camp this summer!

**What is Garden Camp?**

With programs for children ages 5 through 14 (rising K through 8th grade), [Garden Camp](https://gggp.org/learn/family-community/garden-camp/) connects children to plants and each other through structured activities and unstructured play, all amidst plants from around the world. We strive to enrich the “whole child” and develop a deep appreciation for plants, comfort with outdoor learning, and a lifelong love for the Gardens of Golden Gate Park. 

**When is it happening?**

Garden Camp will host four sessions this summer from June to August, with each day running from 9am-4pm. No early or extended care is included. 

[You can view all sessions and register now here. ](https://gggp.org/learn/family-community/garden-camp/)

Session 1   
Monday, June 17 – Friday, June 28   
 _No camp Wednesday, June 19 (Juneteenth)_

Session 2   
Monday, July 1 – Friday, July 12   
 _No camp Thursday, July 4, Friday, July 5, or Monday, July 8_   
**Note:** This is a mini session, recommended for first time campers or those traveling during the 4th of July holiday. 

Session 3   
Monday, July 15 – Friday, July 26 

Session 4   
Monday, July 29 – Friday, August 9 

**What do people love about Garden Camp?**

Garden Camp is a favorite of campers, parents, and caretakers alike! This summer, children will be engaging all their senses as they explore the Gardens. They’ll feel the sun warm their skin, listen to the hawks and jays as they fly overhead, sniff the sweet-smelling blooms… and through their senses, they’ll change their relationship with the outdoors. 

Join us as we watch turtles by the pond, marvel at the architecture in the Japanese Tea Garden, wander through the tropics in the Conservatory, party with the puya plants, and help upkeep the Children’s Garden all summer long. Our popular camp program grows every year, and this summer we’re excited to be focusing on how our senses can deepen our connection to nature. 

But don’t just take our word for it! Listen to some of our many satisfied parents and caretakers:

_This was the third year my son has gone to Garden Camp and he still loves it! I like that he is outside all day walking around and learning something. He loves digging holes and learning about plants, bugs, and animals. He’s met lots of new friends and he comes home smiling every day. He is very excited to take the whole family on a guided tour of the Botanical Garden after each session._

— Francesca L. 

_Fantastic experience! The kids got to learn more about how to take care of plants from composting to planting seeds. They had 2 field trips during the camp (Conservatory of flowers and Japanese Tea Garden). And they played lots of games, did lots of artistic activities with paint and clay, sang and danced. The camp coordinators were very clear and attentive. The counsellors were amazing – fun, sweet and pedagogical. We would definitely recommend the camp to friends and are surely planning on doing it again in the coming years!_

— Marie L.

“I like that he is outside all day walking around and learning something… he comes home smiling every day.” 

**How much does it cost?**

Garden Camp uses a Tier System for pricing. All prices are subsidized for program weeks with less than 10 days. Members will receive a 10% discount regardless of their chosen tier, which will be applied through a discount code sent out prior to registration. 

Please consider selecting the highest payment tier you can afford. In doing so, you’ll help others participate in Garden Camp and experience the outdoors themselves! Our community at the Gardens always benefits from greater diversity — after all, the Gardens of Golden Gate Park are everybody’s gardens. 

For full details on Garden Camp pricing, [visit the Garden Camp page](https://gggp.org/learn/family-community/garden-camp/). 

**Where can I register?**

[Registration for Summer 2024 is open now!](https://www.activityhero.com/widgets/6577/hosted) All spots for K-5th students in Sessions 1 and 4 have been filled, but Sessions 2 and 3 are still open to join. All Middle School sessions have openings in each session. Openings are limited, though, so be sure to sign up today!

**Can I work at Garden Camp?**

To become a Garden Camp Counselor, you’ll need a week of in-person training, CPR/First Aid certification, Mandated Reporter Certification, and an additional staff day in mid-summer. For more information, [view the full job description.](https://gggp.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GGGP_Summer_Garden-Camp-Counselor__011624-1.pdf)

**Does Garden Camp have a FAQs section?**

Our FAQs can be found on [the Garden Camp page.](https://gggp.org/learn/family-community/garden-camp/)
