## Donor-Advised Funds and IRA Charitable Distributions

**Donor Advised Funds**

Support the Gardens with a gift from your donor-advised fund. Recommend Gardens of Golden Gate Park as the grant recipient and provide your name as the grant advisor. Note that our public/private partnership agreement with San Francisco Recreation & Parks prevents us from accepting grants made anonymously.

**IRA Charitable Distributions**

IRA owners age 70 1/2 or over have the option to transfer $100,000 to charity tax-free each year. Known as qualified charitible distributions or QCDs, these transfers offer eligible retirees a great way to support their favorite charities before the end of the year. For those who are at least 72, QCDs count toward the IRA owner’s required minimum distribution (RMD) for the year, lowering their taxable income.

The distribution must be made directly from your IRA to Gardens of Golden Gate Park. Instruct your plan administrator to send a specific dollar amount directly by check or electronic transfer.

Please note that QCDs and grants from donor-advised funds are fully tax deductible and may not be used for the purchase for any portion of event tickets, such as our annual gala.

If you have questions or need further information to make your gift, please contact:

## Employer Matching Gifts

Double or triple your support by having your gift matched by your employer. Contact your employer’s human resources department to find out if they have a matching gift program and request a match when you make your gift.

![](https://gggp.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/cof-july-2019-drew-bird-003_550x.jpg)

## Real Estate

When you make a gift today of real estate you have owned longer than one year, you qualify for a federal income tax charitable deduction equal to the property’s full fair market value, subject to an independent appraisal.

This deduction lets you reduce the cost of making the gift and frees cash that otherwise would have been used to pay taxes. By donating the property to the Gardens of Golden Gate Park, you also eliminate capital gains tax on its appreciation.
