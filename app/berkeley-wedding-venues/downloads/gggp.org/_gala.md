### Gala for the Gardens  
Saturday, May 9, 2026  
11am – 2pm  
San Francisco Botanical Garden, Celebration Garden

Celebrate nature, community, and the wonder of our planet at Gala for the Gardens, the annual benefit supporting the Conservatory of Flowers, Japanese Tea Garden, and San Francisco Botanical Garden. 

We’re thrilled to honor long-time ambassadors and friends to the Gardens, Ruth and Ken Wilcox, and welcome the award-winning author Margaret Renkl, for an afternoon to remember. 

Proceeds from the Gala provide invaluable support to sustain our diverse living collections, make possible a rich variety of programs for individuals and families year-round, and ensure that the Gardens of Golden Gate Park are accessible to all. 

We invite you to become a sponsor and join us in creating a lasting impact! As a sponsor, you will not only enjoy a day filled with inspiration and camaraderie but also play an instrumental role in supporting the Gardens’ mission to connect people to plants, the planet, and each other. 

Explore sponsorship levels and benefits, including recognition and exclusive opportunities, below.

## Special Guest Speaker  
Margaret Renkl

We are thrilled to welcome **Margaret Renkl**,  author and contributing opinion writer for _The New York Times_. Known for her lyrical reflections on nature, family, and the complexities of Southern life, Renkl explores the intersections of the natural world and human experience. Renkl is the author of _Late Migrations: A Natural History of Love and Loss_ and _Graceland_ ,_at Last: Notes on Hope and Heartache from the American Sout_ _h_ , both praised for their keen observation, emotional depth, and graceful prose.

Her most recent work, _The Comfort of Crows: A Backyard Year_ , continues her exploration of everyday beauty and the passage of time, solidifying her reputation as one of the most thoughtful voices in contemporary American nature writing. Her children’s book, _The Weedy Garden_ , illustrated by her brother, Billy Renkl, invites its audience to observe the vibrant ecosystem of a backyard gardener and will be released in early Spring 2026.

## Honorees  
Ruth & Ken Wilcox

This year we are thrilled to honor exceptional organizational stewards and community ambassadors, **Ruth and Ken Wilcox**.

Ruth joined the Gardens of Golden Gate Park Board of Directors in 2017 and has served as Vice Chair, Governance Committee Chair, Philanthropy Committee Chair, and Gala Co-Chair in addition to volunteering as a docent and serving on the Capital Campaign committee for a new plant nursery.

Ken has served as chair of the Asia Society Northern California, on the board of the Asian Art Museum and many other organizations. He helped the Gardens develop their first investment committee and policy for a new endowment and currently serves on the Gardens’ Finance Committee.

Their generosity and engagement have been critical to the growth and success of the Gardens.
