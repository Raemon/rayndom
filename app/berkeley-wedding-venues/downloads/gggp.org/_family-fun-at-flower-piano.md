# Family Fun at Flower Piano

August 30, 2024

[Flower Piano](https://gggp.org/flowerpiano/) at the San Francisco Botanical Garden is a vibrant, family-friendly event where visitors of all ages can immerse themselves in the magic of music amidst a stunning natural backdrop. [Opening Night](https://gggp.my.salesforce-sites.com/ticket/#/events/a0SWP000000UQ572AG) welcomes everyone who appreciates the cool beats of Cuban music, with the added delights of lawn games, comfortable lounge seating, a DIY Flower Bar, and delicious locally made food and drink. Please note that tickets are required for children aged 2 and up for Opening Night and all Lounge concerts.

Throughout the event, there are numerous activities designed with families in mind. On Friday morning, September 13, [the San Francisco Ballet hosts a Family Dance-Along in the Lounge](https://gggp.org/event/flower-piano-lounge-family-programming-by-san-francisco-ballet-family-dance-along/), where children can waltz with the flowers and express themselves through movement. The following Friday, September 20, the Lounge features a [whimsical puppet show by Rabbit Hole Theater, followed by Sixth Station Trio](https://gggp.org/event/flower-piano-lounge-family-programming-by-rabbit-hole-theater-and-sixth-station-trio/), who will take children on a nautical musical journey.

On both weekends, Fountain Plaza becomes a hub of family fun at the Bean Sprouts Tent, offering nature-themed crafts and games by our Youth Education Team and SF Bay Area Moms. Don’t miss the chance to visit the Haight Street Art Center, where you can pull your own collectible Flower Piano Art Screen Print to take home. Then capture all the fun memories at the Say Ya! Photo booth.

On Sunday, September 22, the Great Meadow will host “Sing with Noe,” a welcoming singing circle at 4pm where voices of all ages can join in song. Aspiring performers will enjoy student performances from groups like Plumrose Piano Studios, the Conservatory of Music, and the SF Jazz High School All Stars, offering inspiration as the ‘big kids’ take the stage. One of the event’s highlights for children is the scavenger hunt-like adventure of finding all twelve pianos hidden throughout the garden.

There’s already excitement surrounding the return of the Vanessa Carlton animatronic robot piano on the weekend of September 14 – 15 —a delightful musical surprise that was a huge hit with all! [Flower Piano](https://gggp.org/flowerpiano/) is not just a celebration of music—it’s an event where families can create lasting memories together in one of San Francisco’s most beautiful outdoor spaces.
