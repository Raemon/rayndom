### Start and Grow Your Business

Apply for Small & Local Business Certification __

Businesses located in the City of Oakland may apply for the certification as a Local Business Enterprise (LBE) or Small Local Business Enterprise (SLBE) or Very Small Local Business Enterprise (VSLBE) or Locally Produced Goods (LPG).

## Program Update

As of January 6, 2025, the City of Oakland has changed Small and Local Business Enterprise (S/LBE) certification criteria. These [legislative changes](https://oakland.legistar.com/View.ashx?M=F&ID=13640207&GUID=F7C47041-266E-4165-86F4-95A3A5F39E0C) (Ordinance 13825 C.M.S.) apply to all types of small business certifications.

  * The main legislative change removed the requirement that a business be headquartered in Oakland. Businesses may now have a substantial presence in the City of Oakland to be certified.
  * The definition of substantial presence and full certification criteria can be found on [Page 20 of the Local and Small Local Business Enterprise Program manual](https://oakland.legistar.com/View.ashx?M=F&ID=13567665&GUID=74397FF5-5E73-490F-8237-A6CAE95728B9).



Please note that our vendor is currently updating our certification program, [Business Inclusion Management System (BIMS)](https://oaklandca.diversitycompliance.com/), to reflect program changes. However, all applications for certification, whether a first-time application or renewal application, including any pending applications, will be reviewed under the new criteria as of January 6, 2025. If you encounter any technical issues with your application during this time, or have any questions about the new program criteria, please email [certification@oaklandca.gov](mailto:certification@oaklandca.gov).

## Program Details

The City of Oakland's Economic and Workforce Development Department has received the The Local Immigrant Integration and Inclusion Grant (LIIIG) of $275,000 from California Governor's Office of Business and Economic Development (GoBiz), to build upon Oakland's leadership in equitable economic development, and provide targeted support to Oakland's micro-enterprise and small businesses, with a focus on immigrant and women owned businesses. EWDD has partnered with the Unity Council and Feed the Hunger Fund ("FTHF") to provide culturally and linguistically competent business assistance and access to capital to ensure these businesses are established and successful. With this grant funding, EWDD, The Unity Council and FTHF are building upon existing programs and small business services, and establishing a specially targeted program for immigrant start-up businesses to build a more resilient and inclusive business community in Oakland.

This grant funded program is recruiting program participants, provide technical assistance including digital literacy instruction, individual coaching, translation services, and business development workshops. This program will also convene entrepreneurs for networking and peer-to-peer learning opportunities, access to capital via low interest loans, and host quarterly networking events for new immigrant entrepreneurs. Participating entrepreneurs will be able to prototype and test their products and services, develop their skills and grow their business through retail pop-ups at Oakland events with wrap-around assistance provided by program staff to coach vendors on licensing and permitting, merchandising, payment processing, marketing and customer feedback tracking. **In the next year, the program will** provide $50,000 in grants from Citi Foundation to mobile food vendors, in addition to $250,000 in low interest loan capital to qualified program participants.

**2024 Workshop Schedule (last Thursday of every month, 6-8pm:**

  * April 25 - Bookkeeping
  * May 30 - Cocinando en Casa con licencia
  * June 27 - Social Media
  * July 25 - Credit Building/Repair
  * August 29 - Lease Negotiation
  * September 26 - Customer Service



This grant funds one fulltime Business Engagement Specialist at The Unity Council to work with the Spanish speaking and Mam population as well as a part time Senior Business Advisor to work with the Vietnamese speaking population. This program will leverage three other already existing positions, a Digital Literacy Instructor, a Business and Community Relations Manager and an Economic Development Manager.

This grant also funds one part-time Feed the Hunger Fund Business Support Loan Specialist and leverages existing highly skilled staff to conduct outreach, provide business training and Individual coaching session to program participants, and administer $160,000 in loan capital to qualified program participants. The program aims to build on the success of the Unity Council's Small Business Development Center to reach and respond to a growing demand for coaching, technical assistance and support services for emerging businesses, a key strategy to build assets and wealth amongst communities with the least access to this type of support.
