## Adopt-a-Creek/Adopt-a-Spot

Through the District’s [Adopt-a-Spot and Adopt-a-Creek](https://www.acpwa.org/pas/adopt-a-spot) program, you can take an active role in preserving our natural environment. It’s a great way to feel connected to your community and to help maintain healthy grounds and water systems. 

Adoption comes with responsibilities. There’s a number of ways you can meet the challenge:

  * Remove trash and other debris
  * Remove weeds
  * Plant native trees, shrubs, and wildflowers
  * Care for plants and wildlife habitat



Participating in Adopt-a-Spot or Adopt-a-Creek is easy. First, select and map a portion of the waterway of interest. Then, contact the Flood Control District at 510-670-5501 and an Adopt-a-Spot coordinator will review your selection. If the location is not already taken and if the area is deemed safe for volunteer workers, the spot can be adopted. The District provides free trash bags and trash disposal, gloves, and orange safety vests for Adopt groups that coordinate with us. 

Applications and permits are renewed annually. Volunteers must apply for the free permit, and then review and follow District safety and notification requirements. Volunteer efforts are rewarded with recognition signs near the selected site.

## Other Volunteer Opportunities

[**Tule Ponds Community Service**](http://www.msnucleus.org/watersheds/tule/tule.html)

High school community service groups, Girl Scouts, Eagle Scouts, and other volunteers can undertake public service projects through habitat creation and improvement, trail upgrades, species monitoring, and native plant maintenance. It’s a great way to get involved in environmental planning from a young age! 

**Cooperative Rain Data Collection Program**

The Cooperative Rain Data Collection Program is a community-based program designed to enhance local understanding of rainfall patterns across Alameda County. Through the efforts of dedicated volunteers, the program collects daily rainfall measurements from multiple locations using standardized rain gauges.

Volunteers record and submit rainfall data, which are compiled and analyzed by Alameda County Flood Control and Water Conservation District (District) staff to supplement the District’s network of rainfall gauges and to support hydrologic modeling, flood forecasting, and watershed management efforts. This grassroots data collection effort helps fill gaps in official precipitation records and provides valuable insights into localized storm impacts, seasonal trends, and climate variability.

Participants receive guidance on proper installation and maintenance of rain gauges, as well as training on data reporting methods. Collected data are shared with local agencies, researchers, and the public to promote transparency and community engagement in water resource management.

By participating, volunteers contribute directly to improving the accuracy of rainfall monitoring and strengthening the County’s resilience to droughts and floods.

Weather and science enthusiasts interested in participating in the program, or anyone with historic data to share, should contact Ramses Manalo at 510-670-6470 or [ramses@acpwa.org](mailto:ramses@acpwa.org).
