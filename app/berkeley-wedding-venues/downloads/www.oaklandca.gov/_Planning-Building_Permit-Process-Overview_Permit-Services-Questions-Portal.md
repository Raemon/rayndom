## Online Permit Center Account Questions 

## How can I update my license(s) in the Online Permit Center?

One or more of your license(s) may show as expired in our system. Please send a copy of your updated license(s) to [pbdaccelaregistration@oaklandca.gov](mailto:pbdaccelaregistration@oaklandca.gov).

## How do I apply for an account through the Online Permit Center? 

**OWNERS:** If you are applying for a permit as the property Owner, you will need to provide the following: 

  * A copy of your current California Driver’s License or Identification Card
  * A copy of the recorded deed for the property 
  * A completed [Owner-Builder User Agreement](https://us.openforms.com/Form/2792b830-9f88-4c18-956e-472a598a0c1a)* 



Your Architect or Representative may complete the online registration for you by completing the registration application and by providing copies of information as described above. Be sure that they input their email address for registration access.  
  
**CONTRACTORS:** If you are applying for a permit as the Contractor, you will need to provide the following: 

  * A copy of your current California Driver’s License or Identification Card 
  * A copy of your current State of California Contractor’s License 
  * A copy of your current City of Oakland Business License 
  * A completed [Contractor User Agreement](https://us.openforms.com/Form/76f32aae-f6f5-4de9-95b4-803d90ff3977)* 



If you have staff members pulling permits on your behalf, be sure you add their name(s) under “Authorized Agents” on the User Agreement. Each staff person must register using your license information and their email address. 

*** PLEASE NOTE** : Once you've submitted the User Agreement form, a signed PDF version of your agreement will be sent to the email account you provide. Save that form to your device and attach it with your other account registration documents noted above. 

Upload and submit your signed User Agreement and other documentation at our [Online Permit Center](https://aca-prod.accela.com/OAKLAND/Default.aspx). 

[Watch our video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXLBwmWM2ZU) for full instructions on how to register for an account.

## How long does it take to activate my Online Permit Center account? 

Thank you for your patience. For basic access, you may activate your account immediately by clicking on the activation link in the email provided. If you've registered as a Contractor or Owner-Builder, please expect to hear a response within 72 business hours after submitting your supporting documents.

## I can't find my project/permit history in the Online Permit Center. How can I find it? 

Please [click here](https://aca-prod.accela.com/OAKLAND/Cap/CapHome.aspx?module=Building&TabName=Home) to check your permit status in our Online Permit Center.

You may either type in the address number and street name only, or search by Record Number or Permit Number.

You should be able to find basic information on your project or any project on that property. For detailed instructions on how to search by these parameters, please watch our [Check Your Permit Status instructional video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaUy5T_nkgw)

## I can't find my property address when I try to apply for a permit. What should I do? 

Try searching for your property either by the address or parcel number as it appears on your County Tax Bill. Also, try searching by the primary address ONLY; the parcel and owner should be automatically populated. If the system cannot find the address that you are applying for, please create the permit under the primary address (found on your County Tax Bill). You should enter the Unit Number, Apartment Number, or actual address of the project in the Description field.

## I’m stuck on the  step in the application process. What should I do? 

You must have a licensed professional linked to your account, and it should auto-populate for you once you enter the project address. If it does not, your account may need to be updated. Contractors must submit up-to-date license information and a completed agreement form during the registration process (see "How do I apply for an account?" question for details). Contractors may also experience errors when trying to apply for permits at the beginning of each year. It could be that your City Business License has expired (which it does on December 31 each year) or your State Contractor License has expired. Please contact [pbdaccelaregistration@oaklandca.gov](mailto:pbdaccelaregistration@oaklandca.gov) so that your license can be renewed in our system. Once that is cleared, you will be able to apply for permits. Owner-builders should select "Non-Applicable" on the <Select License> step of the process.

## I can’t log in to my account or forgot my ID/password. What should I do? 

Please email [pbdaccelaregistration@oaklandca.gov](mailto:pbdaccelaregistration@oaklandca.gov) to have your account password reset.

## I can’t attach documents or get an error message. What should I do? 

Please double check to see if you are attaching the right type of application. If the problem still remains, you can email [pbdaccelaregistration@oaklandca.gov](mailto:pbdaccelaregistration@oaklandca.gov) and describe the issue you are having. Our staff will look into possible solutions and respond to you within a few hours.

## How do I pay my permit fees? 

If you created your permit using our Online Permit Center, you may pay your permit fees online. 

From the home screen, simply click the “Pay Fees” circle from the main menu, select the appropriate department that’s issuing your permit(s), enter your permit or record # to search for the permit(s) matching your project, and select all appropriate fees that remain due. 

For other fees due, here are additional options to make payments (please refer your permit number on payment inquiry) :

## How do I apply for Mechanical, Electrical or Plumbing work? 

Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing (MEP) permits are each separate permits. We do offer a Building Permit for houses and duplexes that includes the related MEP work and does not require separate permits. However, if you do not need a Building Permit for these building types, then separate MEP permits are needed. All projects that are in buildings with three or more residential units or that are non-residential or mixed-use all require separate MEP permits.

For detailed information on what permits are required and how to apply, please visit our [Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing (MEP) Permits webpage](https://www.oaklandca.gov/My-Household/Building-and-Remodeling/Homeowner-Projects-Permits/Mechanical-Electrical-Plumbing-MEP-Permits).

## Does a water heater replacement need a permit? How do I apply? 

Yes, a water heater replacement requires a Plumbing Permit. For detailed information on what is required and how to apply, please visit our [Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing (MEP) Permits webpage](https://www.oaklandca.gov/My-Household/Building-and-Remodeling/Homeowner-Projects-Permits/Mechanical-Electrical-Plumbing-MEP-Permits).

## What permits are required for my project? What’s the approval process? 

Permits are required to operate a business or construct, alter, repair, or demolish a building. The permitting process will vary based on your project. You may need to obtain permits from the Planning Bureau, Building Bureau, Fire Prevention Bureau, Department of Transportation, Oakland Public Works, the Alameda County’s Environmental Health Department, the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control, or other governmental agencies.

Depending on the scope of work and the zoning of your property, your project may need to conform with design standards as outlined in one or more of Oakland’s various [Neighborhood and Citywide Plans](https://www.oaklandca.gov/Planning-Building/General-Plan-Neighborhood-Plans/Neighborhood-and-Citywide-Plans). You can also check the zoning requirements for your property by visiting our [Oakland Zoning Map](https://www.oaklandca.gov/Planning-Building/Planning-Zoning/Zoning/View-the-City-Zoning-Map).

**EXEMPTIONS:** Some work is entirely  _exempt_ from needing Building Permits [as outlined here](https://www.oaklandca.gov/Planning-Building/Building-Construction-Permits-Inspections/Building-Permits/Work-Exempt-from-a-Building-Permit).

Want more information about the process? See our [Permitting Process](https://www.oaklandca.gov/Planning-Building/Permit-Process-Overview) webpage for further details and links to resources on the possible Planning and Building Permits you’ll need.

**APPLY ONLINE!** Registered and activated users of our [Online Permit Center](https://aca-supp.accela.com/OAKLAND/customization/common/launchpad.aspx) can apply online for a select number of Building Permits. [Watch our video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXLBwmWM2ZU) on how to register for an account.

## How do I submit a revision to my permit application? 

[Submit a Building Worksheet](https://aca-prod.accela.com/Oakland/urlrouting.ashx?type=1002&IsSkipDisclaimer=Y&module=Building&CAPType=Building/Records/Counter/Worksheet) through our Online Permit Center

In the Worksheet, upload your completed [Revision Application](https://us.openforms.com/Form/70d6821d-0377-4b1b-9715-9666c4610b9f) form* and the revised plan sheets (if applicable) as attachments. If your plans were NOT issued electronically, please also include a scan of your issued stamped-approved plans. If you are requesting a revision to an MEP permit, please also include an [ __MEP Worksheet(PDF, 661KB)](/files/assets/city/v/3/planning-amp-building/documents/pc/forms-and-apps/application-mep-fillable-online.pdf "Application-MEP-Fillable-Online-Legal.pdf") that has the items that you want to be added.

*** PLEASE NOTE:** Once you've submitted the Revision Application webform, a signed PDF version of your form will be sent to the email account you provide. Save that form to your device and attach it to your Worksheet with your other documents as noted above.

## An inspector gave me a correction notice. How do I add this to my permit? 

In most cases, the building inspector will identify the need for revisions and issue a correction notice with the steps that the project will need to undertake. This requires a revision to your existing permit. Please visit our [Submit Revisions to Your Permitted Project webpage](https://www.oaklandca.gov/Planning-Building/Permit-Process-Overview/Submit-Revisions-to-Your-Permitted-Project) for complete instructions based on the type of revision you need.

## I submitted a revision but I'm unable to track it. What's the status? 

Please contact us at [bbstatusinfo@oaklandca.gov](mailto:bbstatusinfo@oaklandca.gov).

## I’ve paid all my fees, so why is my permit not yet issued? 

Please be sure you’ve provided us with all the completed documents required for your permit application. If your project requires Plan Check review, your project may be in the queue for review by one of our engineers. The final check process before issuing your permit requires that all departments have signed off on your project, all fees have been paid, and all submission requirements are complete.

You may check on your permit status anytime using our [Online Permit Center](https://aca-prod.accela.com/OAKLAND/Cap/CapHome.aspx?module=Building&TabName=Home).

[Watch our video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaUy5T_nkgw) for detailed instructions on how to check your permit status online.

Please see our [Permit Status Updates table](https://www.oaklandca.gov/Planning-Building/Permit-Process-Overview/Permit-Status-Updates) for further information on what your status means for your permit application.

**ON HOLD STATUS:** If your permit is still on hold, please be sure you have also performed all next steps as noted on our [Construction and Demolition Recycling Requirements](https://www.oaklandca.gov/Planning-Building/Building-Construction-Permits-Inspections/Construction-and-Demolition/Construction-and-Demolition-Recycling) page.

**[](https://www.oaklandca.gov/Planning-Building/Permit-Process-Overview/Average-Permit-Processing-Turnaround-Times)**[Average Permit Process Turnaround Times (Estimates Only)](https://www.oaklandca.gov/Planning-Building/Permit-Process-Overview/Average-Permit-Processing-Turnaround-Times)

## How do I cancel my permit? 

Complete a [Refund Request Form](https://us.openforms.com/Form/5d8f6768-d6ed-4020-a406-32cdb5d088db), which will be sent directly to the Cashier’s Office, along with a copy for your records. Please allow up to 90 business days to review and process your request.

## I fired my contractor. How do I transfer my permit to a new contractor/owner? 

Please provide a notarized [ __Permit Transfer Letter(PDF, 139KB)](/files/assets/city/v/3/planning-amp-building/documents/pc/permit-process/permit-transfer-request.pdf "Permit-Transfer-Request.pdf") to the new contractor/owner. They will need to visit our Online Permit Center to submit a [Building Worksheet](https://aca-prod.accela.com/Oakland/urlrouting.ashx?type=1002&IsSkipDisclaimer=Y&module=Building&CAPType=Building/Records/Counter/Worksheet) and include the Transfer Letter as an attachment. Also include either a [Contractor's Declaration Form](https://us.openforms.com/Form/4dce05a3-abad-4d7c-b73a-ca0c4e408aad) or [Owner-Builder's Declaration Form](https://us.openforms.com/Form/323603bf-a995-4748-a0c4-6d0f6a438067) depending on who the permit will be transferred to.

Only the person/company to whom the permit was issued can authorize a permit to be transferred and as such they would be the one that would need to complete the Permit Transfer Letter. There are some exceptions to this, so please contact us using the form below to see if it is possible to transfer your permit(s) without the permit holder’s approval.

## What’s the turnaround time to process my permit from the date I submit? 

Please visit our [Average Permit Process Turnaround Times](https://www.oaklandca.gov/Planning-Building/Permit-Process-Overview/Average-Permit-Processing-Turnaround-Times) **** webpage for the latest processing estimates (subject to staff capacity).

**IMPORTANT:** In order to assist in getting your application started AND moving, please note that your application is considered to be completely submitted for processing ONLY after application materials are received and  _all_ application fees have been paid.

## Can I rush my permit or get expedited processing/plan checking? 

We are not accepting expedited requests on application intake processing at this time. However, we are accepting expedited requests for Plan Review and issuance processing, depending on staff availability for overtime work. To make a request for expedited review, please fill out an [Overtime Plan Check Request Form](https://us.openforms.com/Form/16f40ee7-fe3f-46f6-8e21-c17ac4bd1ba6).

## Planning/Zoning Questions 

## In what zone is my property located?

An interactive Zoning Map is [viewable on the City of Oakland website](http://oakgis.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=3676148ea4924fc7b75e7350903c7224) to assess your property's zone designation.

Enter the property address, Assessor's Parcel Number (APN), or intersection to locate the site. Hover over the aerial photo to view the property's zoning designation or click on the parcel to view Complete Parcel Information. The map also shows City limits, Port of Oakland zoning jurisdiction, lot size (area and dimensions), etc. Please note: parcels are not surveyed and the Land Use Descriptions are based on Alameda County data that has not been verified by the City of Oakland.

## How can I view City Zoning regulations? 

The City's Zoning regulations may be found on our [Planning Code (Title 17 of the Municipal Code) webpage](https://www.oaklandca.gov/Planning-Building/Planning-Zoning/Planning-Codes/Planning-Code-Title-17).

The Code includes zoning district chapters corresponding to the zoning map, with permitted uses and property development standards (height, setbacks, etc). Other chapters provide definitions, use classifications, and permit information such as for Design Review, Conditional Use Permit (CUP), or Variance permits. Please note, other regulations such as the [Building Codes](https://www.oaklandca.gov/Planning-Building/Building-Construction-Permits-Inspections/Building-Codes) may also apply to select projects.

## Can I build an Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) on my property? What’s required? 

Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs) are generally permitted on residential properties that already have one or more dwellings, as required by California State law. You may submit applications for ADUs on properties with a single-family residence OR multi-family or multi-unit structures. ADUs are classified as "Category 1" for conversions and "Category 2" for new construction.

Check your zoning using the City's [online Zoning Map](https://www.oaklandca.gov/Planning-Building/Planning-Zoning/Zoning/View-the-City-Zoning-Map). Please note that ADUs require a Design Review Exemption (DRX) permit from the Planning/Zoning Bureau, along with Building Permits.

## How can I build an accessory structure on my property? 

Accessory structures include garages and sheds (but NOT ADUs). Up to  _one_ structure measuring less than 120 sq ft per property and used for storage is generally permitted outright and does NOT count towards total lot coverage. If [Mechanical, Electrical, or Plumbing (MEP)](https://www.oaklandca.gov/My-Household/Building-and-Remodeling/Homeowner-Projects-Permits/Mechanical-Electrical-Plumbing-MEP-Permits) work is involved OR if the structure is greater than 120 sq. ft., accessory structures also require a Building Permit.

However, Zoning review is required. No Zoning Permit is required if the structure adds less than 10% new floor area to the property. The maximum height is generally 15’. Side and rear yard setback requirements may be waived IF the entire structure is within 35’ of the rear lot line, maximum wall height is 9’ and maximum ceiling height is 12’ at its peak, at least 50% of the rear yard remains open, and no bedroom or full bathroom is included. The setback exception regulations in the Planning Code may be viewed online under [OMC 17.108.130, Subsection K](https://library.municode.com/ca/oakland/codes/planning_code?nodeId=TIT17PL_CH17.108GEHEYACORE).

**Ready to apply?** Please visit our [Accessory Structures](https://www.oaklandca.gov/My-Household/Building-and-Remodeling/Homeowner-Projects-Permits/Accessory-Structures-Garages-Sheds-Not-ADUs) project application guidance page for details.

## I need to build a fence. Are permits required? 

Fences measuring 3.5' to 6' in height in a front yard require a Zoning Permit and must be at least 60% transparent. Fences over 6' in residential front yards are NOT permitted. Wood and metal fences over 7' require a Building Permit. Fences made of other materials may also require a Building Permit depending on their height.

Please review page 60 of our [ __Design Review Manual(PDF, 15MB)](/files/assets/city/v/1/planning-amp-building/documents/pc/supp-forms/design-review-manual-for-single-family-and-duplex-homes.pdf "Design-Review-Manual-for-Single-Family-and-Duplex-Homes.pdf") for design guidelines. As indicated in the manual, if other fences on the same side of the block are pushed back 18" from the sidewalk, please match that distance for consistency.

In commercial and industrial zones, fences may be allowed up to 8' in height or in some cases up to 10' in height, and require Zoning Review. Some fences between 8 and 10' may also require a Zoning Permit.

**EXEMPTIONS**

For residential properties, the following fences do NOT require a Zoning Permit:

  * Fences measuring up to 3.5' (42”) tall in a front yard
  * Fences measuring up to 8' tall in a side yard or backyard



For commercial and industrial zones, fences under 8' do NOT require a Zoning Permit, but do require Zoning Review.

**Ready to apply?** Please visit our [Fences](https://www.oaklandca.gov/My-Household/Building-and-Remodeling/Homeowner-Projects-Permits/Fence-Permits) project application guidance page for details.

## I want to change my window(s). Is Zoning Review required? 

Zoning Review is required to replace or change windows. In most cases, no Zoning Permit or fee is required. Staff will review the style of window for building compatibility (including historic considerations) and to ensure all windows are matching.

**To request Zoning review or apply:** Please visit our [Window Replacement](https://www.oaklandca.gov/My-Household/Building-and-Remodeling/Homeowner-Projects-Permits/Replace-Windows)**** project guidance page for details.

## I want to install a generator or relocate a utility meter. Is Zoning Review required? 

**GENERATORS:  
**Installed generators require a Design Review Exemption (DRX) permit from the Zoning Counter. Generators should be located at the side (not in a required yard “setback”) or anywhere in a rear yard (including setback). Creek and noise considerations may apply to the review.

**Ready to apply?** Please visit our [Generators](https://www.oaklandca.gov/My-Household/Building-and-Remodeling/Homeowner-Projects-Permits/Generators) project application guidance page for details.

**UTILITY METERS:  
**Zoning review is required to relocate a utility meter at or to a street-facing location, though NO Zoning permit or fees are required. Side or rear placement is preferred. However, if it must be located at a street-facing location and may be visible from the public right-of-way, it must be screened (you may propose a large potted plant in front of it, for example). Electrical and/or Plumbing Permits will also be required. New utility meter installations may also require a [Creek Protection Permit](https://www.oaklandca.gov/Community/Community-Development/Sustainability-Environment/Creeks-Watershed-and-Stormwater/Creek-Protection-Permits).

You may view the Planning Code regulations online under [OMC 17.124.045](https://library.municode.com/ca/oakland/codes/planning_code?nodeId=TIT17PL_CH17.124LASCST_17.124.045TRUTSC).

## I want to install a sign for my business. Are permits required? 

Business signage installation typically requires a Zoning Permit, but may only require Zoning review for most refaces (please note that dark lettering on light backgrounds is discouraged).

The sign chapter of the Planning Code is accessible online under [OMC 17.104](https://library.municode.com/ca/oakland/codes/planning_code?nodeId=TIT17PL_CH17.104GELISI). Please be sure to review the [ __Commercial Design Review Guidelines(PDF, 234KB)](/files/assets/city/v/2/planning-amp-building/documents/pc/supp-forms/design-review-for-non-residential-applications.pdf "Design-Review-for-Non-Residential-Applications.pdf") for commercial signage.

To determine your zone and to measure your parcel frontage to determine maximum signage per property, view the City's [online Zoning Map](https://www.oaklandca.gov/Planning-Building/Planning-Zoning/Zoning/View-the-City-Zoning-Map). 20 sq ft per tenant is automatically allowed as a minimum; includes all commercial tenants.

## What if I have a new project or alteration requiring Regular Design Review, a Conditional Use Permit (CUP), or Variance? 

Projects may require varying levels of **Design Review** , depending on their type, location, historic status, and other factors. Please review our [Design Review Guidelines](https://www.oaklandca.gov/Planning-Building/Permit-Process-Overview/Planning-Building-Permit-Fees-Project-Requirements) by category for details.

A **Conditional Use Permit (CUP)** may be required for new activities, special site or design requirements, and some new facilities. A CUP is reviewed by the Bureau of Planning to analyze and, when necessary, impose special conditions of approval. For further details, along with project submittal requirements, please visit our [Apply for a Conditional Use Permit (CUP)](https://www.oaklandca.gov/Planning-Building/Your-Commercial-Projects-Permits/Conditional-Use-Permit-CUP) page.

A **Variance** is permission to depart from development regulations in the Zoning Code. A Variance may be needed to develop a property when strict application of a Zoning regulation, like maintaining a required yard area, cannot be met due to physical limitations on a property. For more information and how to apply for them, review our [ __Variance Findings(PDF, 599KB)](/files/assets/city/v/3/planning-amp-building/documents/pc/supp-forms/variance-findings.pdf "Variance-findings.pdf") document.

## How do I construct a new home on a vacant lot or new dwelling units on my lot, but NOT an Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU)? 

For new houses, regular Design Review (DR) and a Building Permit is required.

A new California law (SB 9) allows property owners to: 1.) construct a second residential unit on a single-family lot and/or 2.) subdivide a single-family parcel into two separate lots, enabling the creation of either a single-family home or two residential units on each resulting parcel. For details, visit: [Two-Unit Residential Development and Parcel Subdivision Resulting in Two Lots](https://www.oaklandca.gov/My-Household/Building-and-Remodeling/Homeowner-Projects-Permits/SB-9-Two-Unit-Homes-and-Parcel-Subdivisions)

## What if I want to add an external addition more than 1,000sq ft or more than 100% of the existing total floor area outside? 

Zoning Review is required for any project that exceeds either of these thresholds.

For details, visit our [Additions & Conversion to Habitable Space](https://www.oaklandca.gov/My-Household/Building-and-Remodeling/Homeowner-Projects-Permits/Additions-Conversions-to-Habitable-Space) project guidance page.

## Building Inspections Questions 

## How do I schedule an inspection?

Once the permit for your project has been issued and construction has begun, you may request a permit inspection. Please use our City of Oakland Building Inspection Request app for your mobile device:

  * [Apple iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/oakland-inspection-request/id1536410984)

## Which inspections are required for my project?

To help you determine which inspections are required for your permitted project, we provide a guide, [ __What to Expect During Your City of Oakland Building Inspection(PDF, 1MB)(PDF, 1MB)](/files/assets/city/v/1/planning-amp-building/documents/bi/what-to-expect-during-your-city-of-oakland-building-inspection-4.2021.pdf "What-to-expect-during-your-City-of-Oakland-Building-Inspection-4.2021.pdf"). Here, you will find the most typical inspections performed for new residential projects (from the ground up) and for additions, repairs, and alterations.

The information contained in this handout is specific to the City of Oakland and no other jurisdictions. It is not intended to be used as a reference or a basis for all residential projects. Each project is different and may require additional, specific, or other methods.

For more detailed permit inspection information, consult the [ __Residential Repair Inspection Manual(PDF, 15MB)(PDF, 15MB)](/files/assets/city/v/1/planning-amp-building/documents/bi/residential-inspection-manual-version-2-2.2.2021.pdf "Residential-Inspection-Manual-Version-2-2.2.2021.pdf").

Permit Inspections does not offer same-day inspections.

**Need more info?** Email your follow-up question with your project permit # to [InspectionInfo@oaklandca.gov](https://www.oaklandca.gov/InspectionInfo@oaklandca.gov).

## I received a correction notice. What do I do now? Who do I contact if I have questions about my corrections notice?

Typically, when an inspector issues a Correction Notice, the project is responsible for making the necessary corrections and then calling for re-inspection for an inspector to verify that the corrections have been completed.

If there are questions as to any of the correction items, the project has two options:

  1. Send an email to the inspector(s) who issued the corrections for further clarification
  2. Request a field inspection for informational purposes if further clarification is needed.



**Need more info?** General code questions and clarifications may also be sent to [InspectionInfo@oaklandca.gov](mailto:InspectionInfo@oaklandca.gov).

## What is a Special Inspection? How can I get a Special Inspection?

A Special Inspection is the inspection of construction requiring the expertise of an approved Special Inspector to ensure compliance with the building code, project engineer design, and the approved construction documents as per California Building Code (CBC) 202.

Special Inspections are typically prescribed by the design engineer and/or the City of Oakland plan checker as per CBC 1705.

The City of Oakland also has a site dedicated to Special Inspection Information: [Special Inspections as Required by the California Building Code and City of Oakland](https://www.oaklandca.gov/Planning-Building/Building-Construction-Permits-Inspections/Building-Inspections/Special-Inspections-as-Required-by-the-California-Building-Code).

**Need more info?** Email your follow-up question with your project permit # to [InspectionInfo@oaklandca.gov](mailto:InspectionInfo@oaklandca.gov).

## How do I know if a Special Inspection is needed?

If a Special Inspection is required, it will be noted on the approved plan sets, job card, and permit issuance. It is advised that you inquire about the need for a Special Inspection at your next field inspection.

**Need more info?** Email your follow-up question with your project permit # to [InspectionInfo@oaklandca.gov](mailto:InspectionInfo@oaklandca.gov).

## What is a Project Summary Report (PSR)?

If applicable to the project, a PSR is verification that all energy code requirements for that specific project have been met. Projects are advised to consult with their design professional and/or Energy Consultant as to project-specific requirements.

**Need more info?** Email your follow-up question with your project permit # to [InspectionInfo@oaklandca.gov](mailto:InspectionInfo@oaklandca.gov).

## The inspector says I need a GreenPoint rater and/or CalGreen Checklist. What is this?

This document acknowledges that the project has complied with the requirements of the California Green Building Code. The homeowner or project can consult with a Greenpoint rater or fill out the [ __2019 California Green Building Standards Code Residential Mandatory Measures Checklist(PDF, 769KB)(PDF, 769KB)](/files/assets/city/v/1/planning-amp-building/documents/bo/green-building/aia-ca-2019-cbc-requirements-residentialmandatorymeasures_aug-1-2019-supplemental.pdf "AIA-CA-2019-CBC-Requirements-ResidentialMandatoryMeasures_AUG-1-2019-SUPPLEMENTAL.pdf") to ensure that all items have been completed. The owner can sign on the last page of this checklist.

**Need more info?** Email your follow-up question with your project permit # to [InspectionInfo@oaklandca.gov](mailto:InspectionInfo@oaklandca.gov).

## What is a Field Check inspection?

The purpose of a Field Check inspection is to obtain field information prior to the issuance of a permit. The need for a field check inspection is determined either by Code Enforcement or the Permit Center based on specific project conditions. The inspector will provide a comprehensive list of items that may apply or determine that the information that has been provided, and the site conditions are acceptable for the project to move forward with the permitting process.

The site must have any plans/construction documents and a person over the age of 18 with knowledge of the work that took place to answer any questions that the inspector may have during a field check inspection.

Please note that inspectors cannot provide design guidance, how-to, or project consultation as an enforcement agency. If the inspector determines that plans with specific details will be required, the permittee is responsible for finding a design professional to provide the necessary plans and specifications.

**Need more info?** Email your follow-up question with your project permit # to [InspectionInfo@oaklandca.gov](mailto:InspectionInfo@oaklandca.gov).

## Code Enforcement Questions

## How long does it take to correct a code enforcement violation?

Code Enforcement Services uses progressive enforcement to follow up on complaints. Correction timelines vary on a case-by-case basis. The maximum timelines for correcting violations are as follows:

**Courtesy Notice** : Once a complaint has been filed for a minor violation, a Courtesy Notice is sent to the property owner. The property owner is given 21 days (about 3 weeks) to respond to the notice.

**Notice of Violation** : Once a violation has been found by a Building Inspector, the property owner has 30 days (about 4 and a half weeks) to correct the violation.

**Notice of Violation - Graffiti** :

  * Occupied properties: Property owners are given 10 days (about 1 and a half weeks) to correct the violation.
  * Unoccupied Properties: Property owners are given 15 days (about 2 weeks) to correct the violation.



**Notice of Violation - Garbage/Recycling Receptacles** : 10 days (about 1 and a half weeks) to correct

Learn more about the Code Enforcement process on our [Private Property Complaints and Code Enforcement Services](https://www.oaklandca.gov/Planning-Building/Code-Enforcement-Services) webpage.

## How do I request more time to correct a violation? 

If you have received a Courtesy Notice through the mail, you may contact Code Enforcement at (510) 238-3381 to request an extension.

If you have received a Notice of Violation, you must fill out a [Code Enforcement Compliance Extension Request Form](https://us.openforms.com/Form/5462fd96-2263-4e04-8941-cdea9a107bd5) to your assigned Code Enforcement Inspector that verified the violation on your property. If you do not know the name of the inspector that verified the violation, you may review the property complaint record through our [Online Portal](https://aca-prod.accela.com/OAKLAND/Cap/CapHome.aspx?module=Enforcement&TabName=Enforcement&TabList=Home%7C0%7CBuilding%7C1%7CPlanning%7C2%7CEnforcement%7C3%7CFire%7C4%7CCurrentTabIndex%7C3).

## Why haven’t the owners cleaned up their property? 

There are several reasons why property owners may not respond to a Code Enforcement violation. Please check the status of the property complaint to see what violations have been issued and on which date(s). A step-by-step guide on how to search complaint records can be found [here](https://www.oaklandca.gov/Planning-Building/Code-Enforcement-Services/Report-a-Property-Complaint) (scroll down to Step 6: How to Check the Status of a Complaint).

If the violation is not corrected, a Re-inspection Notice will be issued  _unless_ the issue is blight, in which case the City will post the property as blighted and proceed with Clean-Up contracting.

## When was the Notice of Violation issued? 

Please refer to our [Report or Check Status of a Property Complaint](https://www.oaklandca.gov/Planning-Building/Code-Enforcement-Services/Report-a-Property-Complaint) webpage.

## What is the status of my complaint? 

Please refer to our [Report or Check Status of a Property Complaint](https://www.oaklandca.gov/Planning-Building/Code-Enforcement-Services/Report-a-Property-Complaint) webpage.

## Why does it take so long to get a property cleaned up? 

Clean-up timelines vary on a case-by-case basis. An agreement is entered into with each property owner/agent/buyer to rehabilitate the property, correct housing violations, and pay fee assessments on an agreed timeline.

Visit our [Report or Check Status of a Property Complaint](https://www.oaklandca.gov/Planning-Building/Code-Enforcement-Services/Report-a-Property-Complaint) webpage to search for more information on a particular case.

## Why doesn't Code Enforcement remove homeless encampments on private property? 

The City of Oakland's Encampment Management Team (EMT) handles all homeless encampment complaints. The Team is an interdepartmental working group consisting of representatives from Oakland’s Public Works Department (OPW), Human Services Department (HSD), Oakland Police Department (OPD), Oakland Fire Department (OFD), the City Administrator’s Office (CAO), and other consulted departments as necessary (e.g., the Mayor’s Office, the City Attorney’s Office, Parks and Recreation). Learn more at [City of Oakland | Encampment Management (oaklandca.gov)](https://www.oaklandca.gov/Community/The-Unhoused-Community/Homelessness-and-Encampment-Response).

To report a homeless encampment issue, email [Homelessness@oaklandca.gov](mailto:Homelessness@oaklandca.gov).

## How do I check if a property has any violations?
