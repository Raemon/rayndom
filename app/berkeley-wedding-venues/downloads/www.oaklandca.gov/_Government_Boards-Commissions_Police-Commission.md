# Police Commission

![OPC Banner City of Oakland \(2\).png](/files/assets/city/v/1/police-commission/commission-photos/opc-banner-city-of-oakland-2.png)

The purpose of the Oakland Police Commission is to oversee the Oakland Police Department to ensure its policies, practices, and customs conform to national standards of constitutional policing, and to oversee the Office of the Inspector General, led by the civilian Office of Inspector General for the Department, as well as the Community Police Review Agency (CPRA), led by the Executive Director of the Agency, which investigates police misconduct and recommends discipline. The Police Commission is comprised of seven regular and two alternate members, enabled by Oakland City Code section 604. All commissioners are Oakland residents and serve in a volunteer capacity.

## Vision

The OPC is an independent, community-centric, civilian oversight body that serves as a national leader in police reform and model of constitutional policing.

## Mission

**OPC fulfills its duties under Measures LL & S1 to provide police oversight by employing bold, innovative and informed strategies to develop policies and practices in the pursuit of justice for the citizens of Oakland.**

Our primary strategies include:

  * Preventing police misconduct
  * Ensuring fair and equitable accountability in disciplinary processes
  * Changing the culture of the Oakland Police Department
  * Building strong police-community relations



Promoting mental health and wellness in the Oakland Police Department

## Core Values

**Core Values**

  * **RESPECT and COURTESY** to create space for honest conversations and foster greater participation. 

  * **EVIDENCE-BASED DECISION MAKING** utilizing quantitative and qualitative data before making decisions that may impact public safety.

**Understanding Police Oversight in Oakland**

****

## Why Oversight Matters in Oakland — And Is Never Too Much

Oakland has a long and painful history of police misconduct, most infamously exposed during the _Riders_ scandal in the early 2000s. A group of officers was found to have engaged in egregious abuses—falsifying reports, planting evidence, and using excessive force, primarily against young Black men. The fallout led to more than 100 civil rights lawsuits and placed the Oakland Police Department (OPD) under a federal court-monitored consent decree that remains in effect to this day—making it one of the longest-running oversight arrangements in U.S. history.

This legacy reminds us that **oversight is not an option—it is a necessity**.

Oversight ensures that power is not abused behind closed doors. It is a structural commitment to accountability, transparency, and justice. In cities like Oakland, where communities have suffered from racialized policing and broken trust, **there is no such thing as “too much oversight”** —only too little protection when systems are allowed to self-police.

Oversight is not about bureaucracy; it's about prevention. It is the difference between a system that responds only after harm has been done, and one that protects people before harm occurs.

## What is the NSA (Negotiated Settlement Agreement) for OPD?

The NSA is a federal court-ordered reform agreement established in 2003 between the City of Oakland and plaintiffs in a civil rights lawsuit (Delphine Allen v. City of Oakland). It was created to address widespread misconduct and civil rights violations by OPD officers, particularly in the early 2000s.

* * *

### Why Was It Created?

The NSA was a result of a lawsuit following the “**Oakland Riders** ” scandal, in which a group of OPD officers were accused of:

  * Falsifying police reports

  * Planting evidence

  * Excessive force

  * Abusing citizens’ civil rights




This agreement was part of a settlement to avoid a trial, and it mandated sweeping reforms to **improve oversight, accountability, and constitutional policing practices** within OPD.

* * *

### What Does the NSA Require?

The NSA outlines **52 reform tasks** , which include:

  * Use of force policies

  * Racial profiling data collection and analysis

  * Internal affairs investigations

  * Supervisory oversight

  * Officer discipline processes

  * Community policing standards

  * Transparent reporting and auditing




[__Click here to see the OPD tasks and subtasks list.(PDF, 263KB)](/files/assets/city/v/1/police-commission/nsa-tasks-and-subtasks-for-opd-as-of-june-2025.pdf "NSA Tasks and subtasks for OPD as of June 2025.pdf")

Who Oversees the NSA?

  * The **Independent Monitor** (currently Robert Warshaw) is appointed by the federal court to assess OPD’s compliance.

  * The **Federal District Court Judge** (currently Judge William H. Orrick) oversees the agreement.

  * The **City of Oakland** , OPD leadership, the **Community Police Review Agency (CPRA)** , and the **Police Commission** are key internal stakeholders.




* * *

### Current Status (as of 2025)

  * OPD has been under federal oversight for over 20 years.

  * While many tasks have been completed, a few key tasks remain in partial or non-compliance, especially those related to accountability, use of force reviews, and discipline consistency.

  * The City and OPD remain under federal jurisdiction until full and sustained compliance is met for at least one year.




What is the CMC? 

A **Case Management Conference (CMC)** is a court proceeding to review the status of a case. In the context of the NSA, CMCs are periodic check-ins where a federal judge assesses OPD’s progress on the required reforms and addresses any concerns raised by the court, monitor, or city stakeholders.

### What is the Police Commission's CMC Statement? 

The Police Commission’s CMC Statement is a formal written submission provided by the **Oakland Police Commission** to the **federal court** ahead of or in connection with a **Case Management Conference (CMC)** regarding the **Negotiated Settlement Agreement (NSA)**.

## Oversight Structure in Oakland

## **Oversight Structure in Oakland**

The City of Oakland has established a layered and independent civilian oversight system to monitor police conduct, ensure accountability, and promote public trust. Three main bodies work together to fulfill this mission:

### 1\. **Oakland Police Commission (OPC)**

The Oakland Police Commission is a civilian-led body responsible for overseeing the policies, practices, and disciplinary systems of the Oakland Police Department. The Commission has the authority to review and recommend changes to OPD policies, and to make final disciplinary recommendations when there is a disagreement between the Chief of Police and the investigative agency. Its work is guided by the City Charter and the expectations of the Oakland community.

The Commission is composed of seven regular members and two alternates, as established by Oakland City Charter Section 604. Of these, one regular and one alternate commissioner are appointed by the Mayor, while the remaining six regular and one alternate commissioner are selected by an independent Selection Panel. All commissioners must be Oakland residents and serve in a volunteer capacity.

2\. Community Police Review Agency (CPRA)

The CPRA serves as the independent investigative arm of the Commission. It receives and investigates public complaints involving police conduct, including use of force, racial profiling, First Amendment violations, and other potential misconduct. CPRA may recommend disciplinary action and works independently of OPD’s internal affairs system.

### 3\. Office of the Inspector General (OIG)

The OIG is responsible for auditing and reviewing the performance of both OPD and CPRA. It conducts regular audits, evaluates whether investigations and internal processes meet established standards, and identifies areas for improvement. The OIG helps ensure transparency, consistency, and systemic accountability throughout the oversight process.

## How They Work Together

## **Working Together**

Each body plays a distinct role but functions collaboratively:

  * **CPRA** investigates misconduct.

  * **The Chief of Police** reviews those findings and may concur or disagree.

  * **If there is disagreement** , the **Police Commission’s Discipline Committee** makes a final disciplinary recommendation.

  * **The OIG** reviews the integrity of investigations, audits policy adherence, and reports findings to the Commission and the public.




Together, these entities form a robust system of civilian oversight—one designed to protect the public, elevate transparency, and support fair, constitutional policing in Oakland.

## OPC Discipline Committee Process: Step-by-Step

## OPC Discipline Committee Process: Step-by-Step

When there is a disagreement between the **Community Police Review Agency (CPRA)** and the **Chief of Police** regarding proposed discipline for a misconduct case, the matter is escalated to the **Oakland Police Commission’s Discipline Committee**. The following steps outline how that process unfolds:

### 1\. **Case Investigation and Findings**

  * **CPRA** conducts an independent investigation into a complaint of police misconduct.

  * If CPRA concludes that disciplinary action may be appropriate, they **discuss their findings** and proposed outcome with the Chief of Police.




### 2\. **Chief Review and Response**

  * The **Chief of Police** reviews the case and may **agree or disagree** with CPRA’s conclusions and proposed discipline.

  * If the Chief agrees, discipline is imposed accordingly.

  * If the Chief **disagrees** —either with the findings, the level of discipline, or both—the matter moves forward for further review.




### 3\. **Referral to the Discipline Committee**

  * When CPRA and the Chief are not aligned on how the case should be resolved, the disagreement is referred to the **Police Commission’s Discipline Committee** , a subcommittee of the full Commission.

  * The Committee receives all relevant materials, including the investigative file, both positions on discipline, and supporting rationale.




### 4\. **Committee Review Meetings**

  * The Discipline Committee holds a **closed-session meeting** to:

    * Review the investigative findings and discipline proposals

    * Hear presentations or input from CPRA, OPD, and the City Attorney’s Office

    * Ask questions, request clarifications, or review additional documentation as needed




### 5\. **Deliberation and Determination**

  * After careful review, the Committee determines whether to:

    * **Support CPRA’s recommendation**

    * **Support the Chief’s position**

    * **Propose an alternative outcome**

    * Or, in some cases, decide that **no recommendation** will be made due to conflicting or insufficient evidence




### 6\. **Final Recommendation**

  * The Committee’s decision becomes the **final disciplinary recommendation** under the City Charter.

  * This outcome is communicated to both CPRA and OPD for implementation or further internal processing.




### 

This process was created to **ensure fairness, accountability, and independence** in police discipline matters. It prevents any one entity from having unilateral authority and reinforces the City of Oakland’s commitment to transparent and balanced civilian oversight.

## Clarifying Oversight: What the Police Commission Does — and What It Doesn’t

**When the OPC is the Right Choice:**

If you are filing a police misconduct complaint

If you want to challenge OPD policies on discipline, use of force, or officer accountability

If you believe OPD officers engaged in misconduct, racial profiling, or excessive force

**When the OPC May Not Be the Right Choice:**

Crime Prevention & Public Safety Policies → If your concern is about overall crime rates, community safety programs, or emergency response, the City of Oakland Public Safety Committee (City Council) is the better venue.

OPD Staffing, Budgets & Policy Decisions → The Police Commission does not control police funding or staffing levels—these are decided by the City Council’s Public Safety Committee.

General Public Safety Concerns → If your issue is about fire safety, emergency services, or crime prevention programs, the City Council Public Safety Committee handles those, not OPC.

Immediate Police Response Issues → If you're reporting a crime in progress or have concerns about OPD’s patrol response, you should contact OPD directly or bring concerns to the City Council’s Public Safety Committee if they are about systemic issues.

The OPC ensures police accountability, but broader public safety issues should be directed to the City Council Public Safety Committee.

# **Police Commission Statement**

Post-Vote Update on OPD Vehicle Pursuit Policy and Next Steps

Dear Oakland Community,

**On September 25, 2025** , the Oakland Police Commission unanimously voted to approve changes to the Oakland Police Department’s Vehicle Pursuit Policy, as recommended and supported by Chief Mitchell. This decision was the result of a process that carefully weighed community input, public safety concerns, and operational realities.

We want to personally thank everyone who showed up, spoke out, and contributed to this conversation — especially the young members of the Oakland community, who shared an impressive range of thoughtful and nuanced perspectives.

While this vote marks an important milestone, it is not the end of the work — in many ways, it’s just the beginning. **The policy update is one piece of a much broader strategy to strengthen safety, accountability, and trust in our city.**

Now, our focus turns to collaboration. We know that real progress will require us to work together — across agencies, across communities, and across perspectives. 

That’s why we have extended an invitation to Oakland’s leadership stakeholders — including the Department of Violence Prevention, the Mayor’s Office, the City Administrator, City Council, and the Public Safety Committee — to join us in an ongoing, citywide conversation about public safety.

Some of the areas where we’re eager to partner and explore solutions — and where we’ve heard strong interest from the community — include:

  * Investing in technology like GPS tracking systems and dash cameras in all police vehicles to strengthen accountability, transparency, and officer safety.  
  


  * Improving interagency coordination with the California Highway Patrol and other partners to align operations and communication.  
  


  * Strengthening public outreach and messaging, particularly for vulnerable populations, and exploring real-time notification systems to keep residents informed.  
  


  * Assessing impacts on transportation and infrastructure to ensure city planning supports community safety.  
  





Chief Mitchell shared that the new Vehicle Pursuit Policy is targeted to go into effect on January 1, 2026. This timeline gives OPD an opportunity to train all personnel and ensures accurate year-over-year data once implementation begins. 

We will follow his lead as the implementation date approaches.

**  
**

**There is no single solution to Oakland’s public safety challenges — but there is a shared responsibility.**

This policy change is an important step forward, and we look forward to continuing this work together with all of you.

Thank you for your partnership, your passion, and your belief in what’s possible for our city.

With appreciation,

_  
_

_Chair Ricardo Garcia-Acosta_

On behalf of the Oakland Police Commission
