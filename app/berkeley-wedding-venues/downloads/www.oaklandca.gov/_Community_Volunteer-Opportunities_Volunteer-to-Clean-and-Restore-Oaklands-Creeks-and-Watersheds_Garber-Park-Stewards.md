## Short Summary

_**Garber Park** is a 13-acre wildland park owned by the City of Oakland located behind the Claremont Hotel in Claremont Canyon. Garber Park is home to significant stands of big-leaf maple, California buckeyes and regenerating coast live oak woodland and forest. The Garber Park Stewards vision is to safeguard the native wildland resources of Garber Park while reducing the risk of wildfire and improving the trail system._

Thanks, everyone, for your continued support and help in Garber. We look forward to having you join us in our **February****Volunteer Days! **If you are not on our email list for announcements and would like to be notified of workdays and special events please contact us**at gpstewards@gmail.com. **

  
Below are some projects we've been working on to help make Garber Park as fire safe as possible and more accessible for walking and hiking.

  * Several Restoration Sites: Hardwood Creek, Fern Glade, Alvarado Rd Entrance and Evergreen Lane Hillside need much TLC in removing invasive weeds to enable the native plants to grow and expand. Hardwood Creek and Fern Glade are beautiful sites in Garber and good flat areas to work on and abundant in native plant diversity.



In addition we have several special projects:

  * Continue removing Cape Ivy - a project championed and led by Steward Volunteer Mark.
  * Uncaging mature oaks and caging young oaks, buckeyes, and big leaf maples to prevent the deer from eating them. 
  * Conducting a French broom sweep and pulling out any broom we find. This is a project we do every year since we got rid of all the broom in the park a few years ago. The seeds remain viable in the ground for many years and require us to remove them each year to maintain Garber as "broom free" as possible.
  * Trail Work: Many spots along the trail need to be shored up for safe walking. As many of you know, the trails in Garber are steep and narrow, making this difficult but very rewarding. We are also working towards replacing a few crossings and a few steps that will make Garber Park more enjoyable and safer to explore. If you or your group are interested in trail work, please reach out to us.



**_What to wear_ :** a mask, long sleeves, long pants, and good shoes or boots for trail (no open toes).   
_**  
**__**What to** _** _Bring_ : **gloves, a water bottle, snacks, You can use our tools if you don't have them.   
  
_Where to meet_ : At Fireplace Plaza (below the Evergreen Lane entrance) to Garber Park.

  


** _Directions:_ **From Ashby Ave take Alvarado Rd to Slater Lane, Slater Lane to Evergreen Lane, turn Right onto Evergreen Lane. Garber Park is at the end of the street, and Fireplace Plaza is just down the stairs past the entrance. You can park on the side of the street but please do not park in any driveway or individuals parking pad. For those who don't mind a short, but steep walk up the hill you can park at the Claremont Ave parking lot and walk up the trail, until you hit the stairs. **A map and directions to both entrances can be found at garberparkstewards.org.**  
**  
**Everyone welcome. Children under 18 must be accompanied by an adult and have a WAIVER signed by their parent or a responsible adult.
