# Oak Knoll Mixed Use Community

  * **Project Type** Development
  * **Start Date** November 15, 2015
  * **Project Status** Planned



![](/files/assets/city/v/1/planning-amp-building/images/dp/oak-knoll/oak-knoll-village-rendering.png)

The Project is a Master Planned community on the former Oak Knoll Naval Medical Center (PLN15378), which is approximately 191 acres consisting of 918 residences, 72,000 sq ft of neighborhood commercial, 14,000 sq ft of civic/commercial use, open space, creek restorations, and trails.

[Subscribe for updates](https://share.hsforms.com/1K3Mvdzj4Rm2IpoplhKnMxwch6is)

The Project site is located in the South Hills area of Oakland and is bounded by Mountain Boulevard/Interstate 580 to the west, Keller Avenue to the north and east and Sequoyah Road to the south.

## About

**Please see the Upcoming Meetings section below as well as the Project Description for updated information.**

The Project site is located in the South Hills area of Oakland and is bounded by Mountain Boulevard/Interstate 580 to the west, Keller Avenue to the north and east and Sequoyah Road to the south.

### Background

In 1996, the Naval Medical Center Oakland property was subject to a Final Reuse Plan that presented five land use alternatives for the reuse of the property. The Maximum Capacity Alternative within the Final Reuse Plan included a) 584 residential units, b) 400, 000 sq. ft. of commercial space, and c) 32 acres of open space. The Maximum Capacity Alternative was approved by the Oakland City Council as the preferred alternative.

In 2005, SunCal Oak Knoll, LLC proposed the "former Oak Knoll Project" which included 960 residential units, 82,000 sq. ft. of commercial space and 53 acres of open space. The "former Oak Knoll Project" was not approved. The current proposal is modified version of the 2005 "former Oak Knoll Project." Major changes from that proposal include the following:

  * Minor reduction in residential units
  * Relocation of Club Knoll and inclusion of commercial space with the building
  * Additional open space acreage
  * No development on Admiral's Hill (also known as the knoll)



### Project Description (Revised)

The Project site consists of 165 acres of the 183-acre former Oak Knoll Naval Medical Center property, approximately 15 acres of an adjacent property (known as the Hardenstine parcel), and approximately 8 acres of City-owned property for a total of 188 acres.

The Project proposes a mixed-use residential community of approximately a) 918 residential units of varying types; b) 72,000 sq. ft. of neighborhood serving commercial in the Village Center; c) relocation of the historic Club Knoll to the center of the Project site with 4,000 sq. ft. of community space and 10,000 sq. ft. of commercial space; d) approximately 67.6 acres of open space and recreation areas, including a system of trails, bikeways and walkways; e) restoration and enhancement of the Rifle Range Creek, Powerhouse Creek and Hospital Creek corridors (16.7 acres); and a street network designed as a "complete streets" for the safe and comfortable travel of all transportation modes.

The Sea West Federal Credit Union and Seneca Center are located on two parcels in the middle of the Project site and are not considered part of the Project. In addition, the Project Applicant is no longer considering Planning entitlements for the 5.4 acre City of Oakland parcel (known as the Barcelona Parcel) located near Barcelona Street and St. Andrews Road. However, while the Barcelona parcel has been removed from the Applicant's proposal, the City of Oakland is still pursuing a General Plan Amendment and Rezoning only for the parcel. See revised information below.

The Project applicant is requesting several land use entitlements from the City of Oakland, including but not limited to a: General Plan Amendment; Rezoning; Planned Unit Development Permit (PUD) for the entire site; a Final Development Permit (FDP) for the Master Developer Improvements (grading, streets, utilities, entry monuments, bridges, landscaped areas, streetscapes, and parks) and the rehabilitation/ relocation of Club Knoll; Tree Removal Permit; Creek Protection Permit; Conditional Use Permit for Shared Access Facilities; and Vesting Tentative and Final Maps. A Development Agreement between the Applicant and the City is no longer being considered.

## California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Review

### Background

In 1998, the Oakland City Council certified the Environmental Impact Statement /Environmental Impact Report (EIS/EIR) for the Disposal and Reuse of the Naval Medical Center Oakland and Final Reuse Plan including the Maximum Capacity Alternative. A 2006 Initial Study and 2007 Draft SEIR was prepared and circulated for the "former Oak Knoll Project." No Final SEIR was certified. Because Oak Knoll Mixed Use Community Plan Project may result in new or substantially more severe impacts than the "former Oak Knoll Project" analyzed in 2007, the City is preparing a revised SEIR.
