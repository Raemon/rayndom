# Emergency Moratorium on Residential Rent Increases and Evictions 21-22

## Emergency Moratorium Established

On March 9, 2020, the Oakland City Administrator issued a proclamation of Local Emergency, which was ratified by the Oakland City Council on March 12, 2020, due to the novel coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic. On March 27, 2020, the Oakland City Council adopted an ordinance imposing a moratorium on residential evictions, rent increases above the [**Consumer Price Index (CPI)**](https://www.oaklandca.gov/Community/Housing-Programs-Support/For-Landlords/Allowable-Rent-Increases/Learn-More-About-Allowable-Rent-Increases) and prohibiting late fees during the Local Emergency. The Ordinance also prohibits evictions based on nonpayment of rent that became due during the Local Emergency when the tenant suffered a substantial reduction of income or substantial increase of expenses due to COVID-19.

On July 21, 2020 City Council extended the eviction moratorium through the end of the Local Emergency.

_*Please note: The Emergency Moratorium on Rent Increases and Evictions**only** applies to tenancies regulated under the Oakland Just Cause for Eviction and the Oakland Rent Adjustment Ordinances. **The following is a summary.** For complete information, please consult the full text of the [Emergency Eviction Ordinance](https://oakland.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=4406542&GUID=EAF35294-F356-4895-A87A-0C1B9CE4D0C3&Options=&Search=) and the [Emergency Eviction Ordinance Extension](https://oakland.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=4536924&GUID=E331AC8B-A71F-4719-BB45-3B73A94B6AC4&Options=ID%7CText%7C&Search=moratorium). Commercial tenants who have questions about the eviction moratorium should contact Business Development at [busdev@oaklandca.gov](mailto:busdev@oaklandca.gov)._

### Ordinance Established Moratoriums

#### Most Evictions

Most evictions are banned during the Local Emergency. Evictions where the tenant poses an imminent threat to the health or safety of other occupants and Ellis Act evictions are exceptions.

#### Evictions for Nonpayment of Rent that Became Due During the Local Emergency

A property owner cannot evict a tenant for failure to pay rent during the Local Emergency if the rent was unpaid due to a substantial loss of income or an increase in expenses resulting from the coronavirus pandemic. This includes, but is not limited to the following:

  * the tenant suffered a loss of employment or a reduction in hours;
  * the tenant was unable to work because their children were out of school;
  * the tenant was unable to work because they were sick with COVID-19 or caring for a household or family member who was sick with COVID-19; or
  * the tenant incurred substantial out-of-pocket medical expenses.



**The tenant is still obligated to pay rent owed during the Local Emergency. The Emergency Eviction Moratorium does not relieve the tenant of liability for unpaid rent.**

#### Residential Late Fees

For residential tenancies, no late fees may be imposed for unpaid rent that became due during the Local Emergency if the rent was late for reasons resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.

#### Rent Increase

The moratorium prohibits rent increases above 1.9% of the CPI unless required to provide a fair return. The new allowable annual rent increase of 2.5% begins August 1, 2023, and ends July 31, 2024. Property owners contemplating a rent increase during the Local Emergency should contact the Rent Adjustment Program and speak with a housing counselor. Contact information for RAP can be found at the bottom of this page.

### Additional Provisions

#### Good Samaritan Temporary Rent Decrease

A property owner and tenant may agree in writing to a temporary rent reduction without the owner losing the right to raise the rent back to the rate established before the temporary rent reductions. Owners must still comply with all noticing requirements for rent increases, unless the agreement specifically states when the rent will return to the original rent amount.

#### Notice Requirements

The Emergency Eviction Ordinance has very specific noticing requirements. For notices required for evictions and rent increases during the moratorium, please see the Ordinance for specific language.

**If you are unsure or have questions about your situation, please contact the Rent Adjustment Program. Our contact information can be found at the bottom of this page.**

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### What are the dates when the moratorium is in effect?

The Oakland City Council passed this moratorium on Friday, March 27, 2020, effective immediately and continuing through the end of the Local Emergency.

#### Are tenants required to notify the property owner in writing that they can't pay rent due to COVID-19?

No. While there is no requirement that tenants notify the Owner that they cannot pay rent due to COVID-19, the Rent Adjustment Program (RAP) encourages tenants to be as communicative as possible about an inability to pay rent due and to keep accurate records and notes of the communication.

#### Are tenants required to provide proof to the property owner that their income was reduced because of COVID-19?

No. While a property owner cannot require a tenant to provide proof that their income is reduced because of COVID-19, RAP encourages property owners and tenants to work together during the moratorium.

#### Are tenants still required to pay rent during the moratorium?

Yes. While the tenant cannot be evicted for non-payment of rent due to loss of income related to the coronavirus pandemic, the emergency ordinance does not relieve a tenant of the obligation to pay back rent that was due during the moratorium.

#### What happens if the tenant's lease expires during the moratorium?

Termination of a lease is never just cause to evict a tenant. A diagnosis of coronavirus, the sale of a property, and foreclosure are also not grounds for evictions under the Just Cause for Eviction Ordinance.

#### What happens when the moratorium is over?

When the moratorium is over, Oakland laws on evictions and rent control still apply. Rent that has not been paid is still due. While a property owner may not evict for unpaid rent due to a loss of income because of the coronavirus pandemic, a property owner may file a small claims action to recover the back rent owed.

## Emergency Moratorium Amendment

On July 21, 2020, **[__Oakland City Council amended the Ordinances on eviction commercial and residential moratoriums(PDF, 191KB)](/files/assets/city/v/1/housing-comm-dev/documents/emergency-moratorium/13606-cms.pdf)** to conform to the Local Emergency and the Governor's Executive Order.

  1. The residential eviction defense to non-payment of rent due to COVID-19 will expire at the end of the Local Emergency as declared by Oakland City Council.
  2. The commercial eviction defense to non-payment of rent due to COVID-19 conformed with the **[Governor's Executive Order](https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6.11.21-EO-N-08-21-signed.pdf)** and **expired on September 30, 2021**. This does not impact Oakland's residential eviction moratorium. Commercial tenants and property owners can find resources here.



**The eviction moratorium covers residential renters.**

This ordinance extends the eviction moratorium that was originally adopted by City Council on Friday, March 27, 2020.

The extended moratorium will prohibit most evictions, effective immediately and continuing through the end of the Local Emergency. Additionally, the moratorium prohibits residential rent increases above 2.7% (the Consumer Price Index, or CPI) and prohibits any late fees related to COVID-19 issues in residential units. Unpaid rent will still be due, and the moratorium does not relieve tenants of the obligation to pay unpaid back rent in the future.

Residential tenants and property owners may contact the Rent Adjustment Program for questions by calling (510) 238-3721 or sending e-mail to [RAP@oaklandca.gov](mailto:RAP@oaklandca.gov). **[Rent Adjustment Program](https://www.oaklandca.gov/Community/Housing-Programs-Support/Rent-Adjustment-Program-RAP)** information is also online.

## Ending of Emergency Moratorium

**Advisory Notice:** On May 2, 2023, City Council had a second reading for final passage of legislation to sunset the COVID-19 Eviction Moratorium, as well as to add new permanent tenant protections. For questions about the end of the City's moratorium, contact a RAP Housing Counselor at 510-238-3721 or **[RAP@oaklandca.gov](mailto:RAP@oaklandca.gov)**.

### Oakland Eviction Moratorium Phase-Out

![Eviction Moratorium Phase Out Postcard](/files/assets/city/v/1/housing-comm-dev/images/eviction-moratorium-phase-out_2023-05-15-195550_okqd.png)

On May 2, 2023, the Oakland City Council passed legislation to end the COVID-19 Eviction Moratorium as well as to add new permanent tenant eviction protections.

The City Council had adopted the Eviction Moratorium in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in March of 2020. That moratorium protected tenants covered by the Rent Adjustment Ordinance (RAO) and the Just Cause Ordinance (JCO) in three ways:

First, **by** Prohibiting any eviction except on health and safety grounds or Ellis Act grounds. The Ellis Act is a state law that allows property owners to terminate tenancies in order to permanently remove their residential units from the rental market (Eviction Moratorium);

Second, **by** Prohibiting any late fees for non-payment of rent (Late Fee Moratorium); and

Third, **by** Prohibiting any rent increases above for the annual Consumer Price Index (CPI) adjustment or any RAP petition approved increase except for those based on Fair Return grounds (Rent Increase Moratorium.)

[__**What changed and is now law as of May 2, 2023:**(PDF, 276KB)](/files/assets/city/v/1/housing-comm-dev/documents/landlords/view-revised-supplemental-legislation-4242023.pdf)

**First, the Eviction Moratorium and the Late Fee Moratorium ended on July 14, 2023.**

Property owners of units covered under the Just Cause for Eviction Ordinance can now terminate tenancies based on any of the just causes listed in the Ordinance.

**Also** , Property owners can now charge late fees.

Note: Under the Tenant Protection Ordinance (MuniCode Section 8.22.640.H), late fees may not be imposed except if provided for in a written rental agreement. However, late payment fees cannot exceed a total of three percent (3%) of the monthly rent for each payment of rent and may only be applied for rent which is five (5) or more days overdue. This late restriction only applies if the applicable written rental agreement was entered into or renewed on or after April 16, 2020.

**Second, the Rent Increase Moratorium ended on June 30, 2024.**

  * Under the Rent Increase Moratorium, annual rent increases for units covered under the Rent Adjustment Ordinance were capped at the CPI, with no pass-throughs (petition-approved rent increases, such as for capital improvements) or banking. After June 30, 2024, property owners of these rental units can collect on any RAP-approved increase as well as banked increases (within the Ordinance restrictions.)



**Other Just Cause Ordinance Changes Effective May 2, 2023:**

  * Tenants cannot be evicted for non-payment of rent that accrued between March 9, 2020 and July 14, 2023 if the rent was unpaid due to financial hardship caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Property owners can pursue collection of this rental debt in small claims or civil court.
  * For evictions based on a violation of the lease, the property owner must show that the breach is based on a reasonable term that the tenant accepted in writing.
  * Tenants cannot be evicted for owing less than 1 month of the fair market rent (‘FMR') for the unit size as determined by the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
  * Occupancy limitations are determined by the maximum number permitted in the unit under state law and/or local codes such as the Building, Fire, Housing and Planning Codes. The previous occupancy standards of two persons in a studio unit, three persons in a one-bedroom unit, four persons in a two-bedroom unit, six persons in a three-bedroom unit, or eight persons in a four-bedroom unit was eliminated.



### Pre- and Post-Rent Increase Moratorium Rent Increases

Date Rent Increase Started | Annual CPI Rate | Allowable Banked CPI | Maximum Rent Increase Allowed Without RAP Petition*  
---|---|---|---  
August 1, 2023 - June 30, 2024 | 2.5% | 0% | 2.5%  
July 1, 2024 - July 31, 2024 | 2.5% | Up to 5% | 7.50%  
August 1, 2024 - July 31, 2025 | 2.3% | Up to 4.6% | 6.90%  
  
**_*When combined with a RAP-approved rent increase, an annual rent increase cannot exceed the state cap. The current state cap, effective August 1, 2024, is 8.8%._**

Rent Increases that Became Effective Between March 8, 2020, and June 30, 2024: Limited to the no more than the CPI rate in effect at that time.

Rent Increases Starting on July 1, 2024, or After: Rent increases effective on or after July 1, 2024, can include banked CPI increases. Rent increases that include banked CPI increases are limited to three times the current annual CPI rate.

### Banking

Banking is any CPI-based rent increase that the owner delays, which can be imposed at a later date. Owners may bank up to ten (10) years of rent increases. However, no annual rent increase can exceed three times (3X) the current CPI. Banked CPI increases are allowed without RAP approval (i.e., petition).

### Rent Registration and RAP Notice

Property owners of units covered under the Rent Adjustment Ordinance cannot increase rents if the unit is not registered with the RAP. All rent increase notices for units covered under the Rent Adjustment Ordinance must include a copy of the Notice to Tenants of the Rent Adjustment Program ("RAP Notice.")

### COVID-19 Related Eviction Protections

#### City of Oakland Regulations

The City of Oakland Rent Board has issued Regulations related to the Emergency Eviction Moratorium. Amongst other elements, it provides guidelines for payment of delayed rent, clarifies the negotiation process for delayed rent, and gives information for RAP mediation services to assist tenants and owners in finding a resolution.

#### State Protections

The Tenant, Homeowner, and Small Landlord Relief and Stabilization Act of 2020 (AB 3088), a state law, and Oakland's Emergency Moratorium provide Oakland tenants protections and homeowners and small property owners relief during the COVID-19 pandemic. These resources below advise Oakland property owners and tenants on their legal rights and responsibilities under state and local ordinances.

*Please note: The Tenant, Homeowner, and Small Landlord Relief and Stabilization Act of 2020 (AB 3088) protects qualifying tenants from eviction for non-payment of rent until February 2021. **The Act will not significantly affect the Oakland Emergency Eviction Moratorium. Oakland's Eviction Moratorium will continue to protect most Oakland renters from eviction during the COVID-19 emergency.** However, tenants living in units not covered by Oakland's Emergency Eviction Moratorium, i.e. units that do not fall under the Oakland Just Cause for Eviction Ordinance, will have additional protections under AB 3088. Contact a RAP Housing Counselor at (510) 238-3721 or [rap@oaklandca.gov](mailto:rap@oaklandca.gov) for more information.

## About the Rent Adjustment Program

_The Oakland City Council adopted the Rent Adjustment Program Ordinance (OMC Chapter 8.22) in 1980. This ordinance sets the maximum annual rent increase based on the annual CPI increase and handles rent adjustments for claims of decreases in housing services and handles other rent-related matters. The purpose of this program is to foster fair housing for a diverse population of renters and enforce the Rent Adjustment Ordinance set out by the City of Oakland._
