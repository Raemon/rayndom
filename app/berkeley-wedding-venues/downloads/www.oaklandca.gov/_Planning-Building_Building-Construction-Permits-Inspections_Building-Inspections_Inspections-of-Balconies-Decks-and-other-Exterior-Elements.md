# Inspections of Balconies, Decks, and other Exterior Elements

![](/files/assets/city/v/1/planning-amp-building/images/bo/inspections/exterior-elevated-elements.png)

**IMPORTANT NOTICE!** Please see below for information on which buildings require mandatory inspections. If required, follow the steps as outlined to submit inspection forms for your building.

Mandatory inspections are required if your building has: 

  1. Three (3) or more residential multifamily dwelling units;
  2. Whole or partially wood framed elements (balconies, decks, porches, stairways, walkways, or other similar structures) that extend beyond the exterior walls of the building; **AND**
  3. Exterior elements with walking surfaces elevated more than six (6) feet above ground level



Those elements qualify as Exterior Elevated Elements (EEE) that must be inspected by a qualified inspector to make sure they are safe, not damaged or dry-rotted, and in good working condition. 

Building owners or HOAs are responsible for scheduling inspections and fixing any problems found. 

**Mandatory Inspections Timeline:**

  * _**Apartments/Multi-Family Buildings Deadline Extended:**_ Assembly Bill 2579 extended the inspection deadline for EEE originally set by Senate Bill 721 (Apartments/Multi-Family Buildings) to January 1, 2026.


  * **_Condo/Common Interest Developments:_** Per Senate Bill 326 (Condos/Common Interest Developments*), inspections of Exterior Elevated Elements (EEE) at Condominiums and other common interest developments were required to be completed by January 1, 2025.



**_* NOTE:_**_A common interest development (CID) is a type of real estate development where property owners share common areas and financial obligations. This includes various forms of housing such as condominiums, community apartments, and planned developments_.

To avoid a Notice of Violation and fee charges, evaluate your property for requirements as outlined in [SB 326](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200SB326) (Condos/CID) or [SB 721](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB721) (Apartments/Multi-Family Buildings) and submit your EEE Inspection Form or Exemption Declaration Form (see below).

**SPECIAL NOTE:** The inspector **cannot** be a current employee of the City of Oakland.

## What Are the Inspection & Reporting Requirements?

**Inspection and Reporting Requirements:**

The inspection will determine whether EEE are properly waterproofed and in good repair, free of decay and other hazards, and safe for residents and visitors. Inspections are required every 9 years for [SB 326](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200SB326) (Condos/CID) and every 6 years for [SB 721](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB721) (Apartments/Multi-Family Buildings). 

A written report of the inspection results must be presented to the building owner or designated agent within **45 days** of completing the inspection.

If the inspection reveals conditions that pose an **immediate** **threat** to safety, the report must be delivered to the owner of the building and the City of Oakland Code Enforcement Services within **15 days**. Preventative measures and/or emergency repairs must be undertaken immediately.

All EEE shall be inspected through the least intrusive method necessary, such as visually, or other comparable means to evaluate condition and performance.

If during visual inspection, conditions are observed that indicate damage or potential damage to load bearing-components, an inspector shall exercise their best professional judgment in determining the necessity, scope, and breadth of any further inspection.

Copies of the reports are required to be maintained in the building owner’s records for 2 inspection cycles.

The report must include the following:

  * SB 326 (Condos/CID): A sufficient number of EEE must be inspected to provide **95 percent** confidence that the results are representative of the whole

  * SB 721 (Apartments/Multi-Family Buildings): At least **15 percent** of each type of Exterior Elevated Element (EEE) must be inspected

  * List of the locations of each Exterior Elevated Element (EEE)

  * Photographs of each Exterior Elevated Element inspected

  * Current condition of each Exterior Elevated Element inspected

  * Expectations of future performance and projected service life




  * Recommendation if further inspection is needed

  * Test results

  * Identify any exterior elevated elements that pose an immediate threat to safety

  * Advice if preventing occupant access or conducting emergency repairs, including shoring, is necessary

  * Identify conditions found that do not pose an immediate threat to safety

  * Recommended corrective repair/replacement

  * Narrative sufficient to establish a baseline of the condition that can be compared to the results of subsequent inspections

  * Report must be stamped or signed by the inspector

  * Subsequent inspection reports shall incorporate copies of prior inspection reports, including the locations of the exterior elevated elements inspected.




## Who May Perform Repairs? Are Permits Required?

Upon receiving the report, any EEE identified by the inspector as requiring repair or replacement shall be the responsibility of the Property Owner or HOA to maintain. The Property Owner or HOA shall take preventive measures immediately, including preventing occupant access to the EEE until repairs have been inspected and approved by the City. Repairs shall be performed by a qualified and licensed contractor **not** serving as the EEE inspector. 

  * **Immediate Threat:** An EEE that the inspector identifies as an immediate threat to the safety, and/or finds preventing access or emergency repairs are necessary, including shoring, shall be considered an emergency condition and the building owner shall perform required preventive measures immediately. 




If an immediate threat is identified, the inspector must provide a copy of the inspection report to the Property Owner or HOA within **15 days** of inspection and submit a copy to City of Oakland Code Enforcement Services.

  * **No Immediate Threat:** If an inspector identifies an EEE that requires repair, but does not pose an immediate threat to safety, the building owner or HOA shall apply for a permit within **120 days** of receipt of the inspection report to perform corrective repairs. Once the permit is approved, the building owner shall have **120 days** to make repairs unless an extension of time is granted by City of Oakland Code Enforcement Services.




Please visit our [One-Stop Permit Center](https://www.oaklandca.gov/Planning-Building/Permit-Process-Overview/One-Stop-Permit-Center-In-Person-Online-Services) or call (510) 238-3891.

If the building owner does not comply with the repair requirements within **180 days** , the inspector shall notify City of Oakland Code Enforcement Services and the building owner. If within **30 days** of the date of the notice the repairs are not completed, the building owner shall be assessed a civil penalty based on a fee of not less than $100 but not more than $500 per day until repairs are completed, unless an extension of time is granted by City of Oakland Code Enforcement Services.

Code enforcement proceedings under the Oakland Municipal Code will be initiated against a building owner or HOA that do not complete corrective work or if work is not completed on time. If a civil penalty is assessed, a building safety lien may be recorded against the property.
