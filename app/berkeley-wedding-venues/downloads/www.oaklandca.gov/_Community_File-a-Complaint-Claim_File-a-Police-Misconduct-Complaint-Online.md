Why should you file a complaint?

Complaints of police misconduct give community members an opportunity to be heard, and helps the CPRA hold sworn members of the Oakland Police Department accountable.  
Complaints of misconduct may prevent other community members from having similar experiences.  
Complaints may result in the discipline of an officer and/or alert police supervisors and the Oakland Police Commission of areas in which changes to OPD policy and training may be necessary. 

Who may file a complaint?

Any member of the public may file a complaint. The Agency has the jurisdiction to hear any type of complaint against a current Oakland police officer. 

What information will help my complaint?

\- The incident date, time and exact location  
\- The officer’s name and serial number  
\- Witness names, addresses and telephone numbers  
\- Any other evidence you feel may be important such as copies of citations, photographs, audio or video recordings, etc.  
  
Once your complaint has been initiated you will have the opportunity to submit further documentation or evidence either to our office, or electronically through the “follow my complaint” functionality included if you register as a user through this website. 

What happens once a complaint is filed?

Once the CPRA receives your complaint, it will be processed through the CPRA intake process and an Agency intake technician and/or investigator assigned to your case may contact you for further information or to schedule an interview related to your claim.
