### Recycle Right and Avoid Surcharges

Surcharges may apply when the wrong materials are found in compost or recycle containers. Residents will be notified after each incident.

Only place acceptable items in the recycling and compost containers as shown on the container labels. Anything else is considered a contaminant. Contaminants can ruin an entire load of materials meant for recycling or composting. The service provider may refuse to collect containers with the wrong material inside and may apply contamination surcharges if the container is picked up. See below for when surcharges may apply.

![On 3rd and 4th incident surcharge of $25 may apply. On 5th incident surcharge of $50 may apply.](https://www.oaklandrecycles.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/surcharges.png)

![can with lid closed, can with lid open and overfull](https://www.oaklandrecycles.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/avoid-overage-charges-150x150.png)

### Avoid Overage Charges

Materials must fit inside your cart or bin with the lid closed for regular service.

Eliminate excess materials by:

  * Having enough large enough carts/bins or pickups to manage all the waste you generate.
  * Making sure the containers work properly – call for repair if needed.
  * Ensuring waste is spread evenly in your bin.
  * Setting out bins just ahead of pickup when possible.
  * Sort your recycle, compost, and trash correctly



If you regularly have excess materials, we’re here to help you.

Call the Customer Service at (510) 613-8700 to help you right-size your service.

Trash Cart Overage Charge = $1.26 per gallon

During years when these holidays fall on a weekday, pickup is one day later for the rest of the week, including Saturday. For example, if your regular service day is Tuesday service will occur on Wednesday, or if your regular service day is Friday service will occur on Saturday.

Trash, compost and recycle collection schedules are not affected by any other holidays.
