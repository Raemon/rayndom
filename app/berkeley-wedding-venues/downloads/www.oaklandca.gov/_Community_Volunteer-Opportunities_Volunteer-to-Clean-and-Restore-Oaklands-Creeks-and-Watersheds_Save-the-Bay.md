# Volunteer for our Bay

#### You can protect and restore San Francisco Bay. Discover how to dig in and make a difference.

With our partners, Save The Bay has preserved and restored thousands of acres of wetlands across our 60-year history. From transplanting native seedlings to removing harmful invasive species, volunteers are essential to the success of this work. We engage community members, schools, and businesses throughout the year to protect and restore the shoreline. Discover how you can get involved.

## Frequently Asked Questions

  * ### Is there an address for the meeting location? 

____

Our restoration sites do not have street addresses, and meeting location is determined based on site needs. If you are participating in any of our volunteer programs, you will receive directions to the meeting location 1-2 weeks prior to the event. We provide specific GPS points that can be plugged into any mapping app or site to get you to the correct location. Because our sites are often not recognized by most mapping programs, we ask that you do not use any other source of directions besides the GPS points provided by Save The Bay.

  * ### Are my children welcome? 

____

Absolutely! Our restoration programs can be a great learning experience for the whole family, and we often have toddlers in our programs. All that is required is a little extra attention and guidance from the parent/guardian. Many of the activities can be modified with your supervision for an enriching day, and we encourage exploration of the shoreline by your little ones!

  * ### What should I bring and wear?

____

Be prepared to be outdoors for three hours. We recommend that you do not bring any valuables or leave valuables in your car. The following should be on your packing list:

    * Sturdy, closed-toe shoes are required
    * Dress in layers; long pants are recommended
    * Sun protection such as a hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen
    * Full reusable water bottle

  * ### Can I reach your sites by public transportation?

____

Unfortunately the majority of our sites are not accessible by public transportation. Out Oakland restoration site along the MLK shoreline is the can be reached with a short walk from the bus stop. We recommend you look into transportation options for each site individually.

  * ### Do you cancel programs because of bad weather? 

____

We will still run programs in a light rain and will provide ponchos for volunteers. High winds or thunderstorms may force us to cancel a program. During wildfire season, we cancel programs if the air quality index is over 101 AQI or deemed unhealthy for sensitive groups. If your program is canceled, you will be contacted on the phone number provided during online registration.

  * ### Can I volunteer to complete community service hours? 

____

Yes, our volunteer programs count toward community service hours, whether school or court mandated. Each program counts for three hours, and field staff can provide and/or sign forms on the day of the event at the end of the program.

  * ### Are your volunteer programs accessible?

____

Save The Bay strives to include volunteers of all abilities in our programs. If you have specific access needs, please reach out to [hlim@savesfbay.org](mailto:hlim@savesfbay.org) to coordinate.

## Storm Drain Master Plan

Cities should create storm drain master plans that identify areas at risk of flooding due to current and future storms and identify projects to ensure the storm drain system has the capacity to function under future conditions. Identified projects should be prioritized based on future flood risk, water quality, and benefits to disadvantaged communities. As much as possible, the city should identify green stormwater infrastructure solutions to drainage issues; this could take the form of a green streets master plan.

## Examples

**Pacifica**

Pacifica’s [Storm Drain Master Plan](https://www.cityofpacifica.org/home/showpublisheddocument/13967/638096319159170000) identifies capacity deficiencies in the storm drainage system, develops feasible alternatives to correct these deficiencies, and plans the infrastructure that will serve future development. It includes an analysis of future precipitation impacts on the storm drain system.

**San Mateo County**

The San Mateo [Countywide Green Streets Master Plan](https://ccag.ca.gov/countywide-sustainable-streets-master-plan/) identifies “how and where to build sustainable streets in San Mateo County that integrate stormwater management with local priorities, like bike and pedestrian mobility, transit improvements, climate change adaptation, and more.” It includes an analysis of stormwater runoff under future climate scenarios, which determined that the planned green street projects could offset the projected roadway runoff due to climate change for a 2-year storm. Additionally, the green streets projects were prioritized based on water quality, flood risk, water supply, climate change impacts, groundwater constraints, utility constraints, vulnerable community indicators, vehicle ownership statistics, urban canopy, and urban heat island effect.

× 

## Integrating Flood Resilience Into Capital Improvement Planning

Local jurisdictions must ensure that public infrastructure (such as parks, streets, sewers, stormwater infrastructure, and shoreline infrastructure) are designed for flood resilience and incorporate nature-based solutions wherever possible. They can do this by creating capital improvement planning processes to ensure all proposed projects are evaluated for flood resilience and green infrastructure potential.

## Examples

**Burlingame**

Burlingame has a green infrastructure checklist used to evaluate opportunities to include green stormwater infrastructure (GSI) features in capital projects. This approach ensures that no opportunities for GSI are missed. It can be found in Appendix B of the city’s [Green Infrastructure Plan](https://burlingame.org/DocumentCenter/View/3151/Green-Infrastructure-Plan-PDF).

**San Francisco**

San Francisco has a [“Guidance for Incorporating Sea Level Rise into Capital Planning in San Francisco Sea Level Rise Checklist”](https://onesanfrancisco.org/sites/default/files/2017-05/Agenda%20Item%207C%20-%20Sea%20Level%20Rise%20Checklist.pdf). Using this checklist ensures that all capital projects planned in the sea level rise vulnerability zone are resilient to sea level rise.

× 

## Shoreline Resilience Plan 

With the passage of SB 272 (Laird, 2014), Bay Area cities are required to create Shoreline Resilience Adaptation Plans (RSAPs) and have those plans approved by the Bay Conservation and Development Commission (BCDC) by 2034. BCDC has released draft RSAP guidelines which cities must follow when creating their shoreline plans. The guidelines will be finalized at the end of 2024. We hope to see the final guidelines reinforce an emphasis on nature-based solutions, public access, and community engagement. 

## Examples

**Hayward**

The [Hayward Regional Shoreline Adaptation Master Plan](https://www.hayward-ca.gov/shoreline-master-plan) (HRSAP) was created in 2021 to establish a vision and adaptation strategies for protecting natural and built shoreline assets from sea level rise. It recommends shoreline resilience projects such as horizontal levees, gently sloping vegetated buffers that provide sea level rise protection and water quality benefits. The HRSAP was created by a joint powers authority consisting of the City, the Hayward Area Park and Recreation District (HARD), and the East Bay Regional Park District.

× 

## Sea Level Rise and Groundwater Rise Overlay Districts 

Sea level rise and groundwater rise overlay districts map out which geographical areas will be affected by flooding under future climate conditions and apply specific development requirements or restrictions on those areas. Overlay districts can be created through a zoning code update and are a key step in ensuring that flood-resilient development conditions are implemented and enforced. [OneShoreline’s Planning Policy Guidance](https://oneshoreline.org/planning-guidance/) provides template language for creating Sea Level Rise and Groundwater Rise Overlay Districts.

## Examples

**Burlingame**

In 2021, Burlingame updated its zoning ordinance to include regulations for the Bayfront Commercial District, including guidelines for new development to be resilient to sea level rise. [Section 25.12.050](https://www.burlingame.org/DocumentCenter/View/2208/Section-2512050-PDF) outlines public access, flood, and sea level rise performance guidelines for new developments. It adopts Burlingame’s Map of Future Conditions, including a Sea Level Rise Overlay District, which is based on the [Our Coast Our Future hazard map](https://ourcoastourfuture.org/hazard-map/).

**South San Francisco**

In 2022, South San Francisco (SSF) [updated its zoning code](https://www.adaptationclearinghouse.org/resources/south-san-francisco-zoning-code-flood-plain-sea-level-rise-overlay.html#:~:text=In%20October%202022%2C%20the%20South,The%20additional%20purposes%20of%20the) to include a Flood Plain/Sea Level Rise overlay district. The overlay district includes areas that will flood under a 36-inch sea level rise scenario and a 100-year storm. It imposes new construction requirements including base flood elevations sufficient to protect against the FEMA 100-year event with 3 feet of sea level rise, nature-based stormwater infrastructure designed to function under future conditions, and a bay access buffer within 100 ft from the shoreline.

## Highway 37

**_Highway 37 will soon be underwater. The highway’s redesign, if done correctly, offers an opportunity to build climate-resilient infrastructure and restore 20,000 acres of wetlands._**

![Aerial of a 3 lane highway with marsh on the left side and water on the right](https://savesfbay.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/KarlNielsen_Highway-37-on-a-dry-day-1024x575.jpg)Highway 37 on a dry day, Karl Nielsen

* * *

## The Issue

Highway 37 sits on a levee in San Pablo Bay in the north Bay Area. In 2017, the highway was shut down for a month due to flooding caused by a combination of King Tides and winter storms. During the atmospheric rivers in January 2023, the highway was again closed for a weekend when it flooded due to Novato Creek overflowing. These closures will likely happen again and again as sea levels rise if no action is taken. This would disrupt 40,000 daily car trips which people depend on to get them to jobs in Marin, Sonoma, Napa and Solano Counties. Additionally, the levee that the highway sits on currently blocks natural tide flow from San Pablo Bay to wetlands on the north side of the highway. 

* * *

## The Solution

[The redesign of Highway 37](https://www.sfchronicle.com/projects/2021/san-francisco-bay-area-sea-level-rise-2021/highway-37) is currently in the early planning stages. One of the proposed designs is to build the highway on an elevated causeway. This would put the highway above the reach of rising sea levels while also letting water ebb and flow with natural tidal action between San Pablo Bay and the wetlands beyond the highway. Once these 20,000 acres of wetlands are reconnected with the natural flow of tides, they can be restored to their full function, providing habitat, carbon sequestration, and flood resilience benefits.

## AstraZeneca Toxic Site

**_Groundwater and sea level rise threaten vulnerable communities by displacing toxic contamination._**

![Aerial video of plot of land on the shoreline](https://savesfbay.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Richmond-AstraZeneca_Business-Journals-1024x576.jpeg)Richmond, CA, San Francisco Business Times

* * *

## The Issue

The AstraZeneca site on the Richmond shoreline was once the site of sulfuric acid, pesticide, and fertilizer manufacturing. Because of this industrial pollution, it is now contaminated with high levels of toxins such as benzene, lead, arsenic, uranium, and pesticides like DDT. So far, cleanup efforts have included leaving contaminated soil on site and “capping” it by placing concrete on top. The City of Richmond has plans to build up to 4,000 housing units on top of this contaminated land. However, as sea levels rise, groundwater will also be pushed up to the surface, potentially pushing the toxins into pipes and through cracked concrete, putting the health of residents and surrounding communities at risk. 

* * *

## The Solution

For decades, frontline community members in Richmond have been raising awareness about the health and environmental threats posed by groundwater and sea level rise displacing toxic contaminants on industrial sites. Because of a long history of racist policies, the communities surrounding these sites are largely low-income communities of color. They are advocating for full cleanup of the AstraZeneca site before any housing is built on it, rather than simply capping contamination in place. This would involve removing all contamination from the site and taking it to a safer storage or treatment site. The Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC), which oversees cleanup of the site, should require AstraZeneca to conduct a full cleanup. Additionally, groundwater and sea level rise should be considered in all toxic site cleanup efforts.

## San Mateo County

**_Of all the counties in California,_[_San Mateo County is the most vulnerable_](https://seachangesmc.org/sea-level-rise-policy-for-county-facilities/) _to sea level rise._ **

![Road closed and car trapped in flooded street under highway underpass](https://savesfbay.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/San-Mateo_Bruce-Washburn_web-1024x576.jpg)San Mateo, January 2, 2023, Bruce Washburn

* * *

## The Issues

**Sea Level Rise**

Sea levels could rise by up to 3.3 feet in San Mateo County by 2070 and 6 feet by 2100 according to the county’s [Sea Level Rise Vulnerability Assessment](https://seachangesmc.org/vulnerability-assessment/). While the whole Bay Area will experience rising seas, San Mateo County is particularly vulnerable, with over 30,000 homes, dozens of schools and hospitals, and over 7,000 acres of wetlands at risk of flooding by 2070. Historically underinvested communities will be the most at risk when flooding occurs because historic inequities [placed affordable housing in higher flood risk areas](https://calmatters.org/environment/2020/12/california-affordable-housing-floods/) and because they are [more vulnerable to economic damages](https://news.stanford.edu/2021/07/12/sea-level-rise-may-worsen-existing-bay-area-inequities/) incurred. 

**Inland Flooding**

Not all flooding happens at the coast. As storms and groundwater rise become more extreme, Bay Area communities will continue to be impacted by flooded streets and homes due to outdated stormwater infrastructure. Additionally, urban areas are primarily covered in concrete, asphalt, and other surfaces that don’t allow water to seep through. This means that during storms, rainwater runs off these surfaces picking up pollutants (like motor oil, chemicals, and trash) on its way to creeks and the Bay. 

* * *

## The Solutions

**Sea Level Rise**

Preparing the county for sea level rise will require a coordinated effort among cities to plan and implement solutions such as wetland restoration, horizontal levees, and sea walls. San Mateo County has taken steps in this direction with the creation of [OneShoreline](https://oneshoreline.org/), a government agency that works across jurisdictional boundaries to plan and implement sea level rise resilience measures in the county. The County also conducted a countywide [Sea Level Rise Vulnerability Assessment](https://seachangesmc.org/vulnerability-assessment/) to identify areas that will be impacted by flooding and erosion and provide solutions. 

This coordinated effort should be replicated across the Bay Area. Cooperation between cities and counties throughout the Bay Area is necessary to ensure that shoreline protection in one area doesn’t result in greater flooding in others. This could happen, for example, when a sea wall in one city deflects storm surges towards an adjacent city without flood protections. There should also be coordination at the state and federal level to provide funding to low-income cities that may not otherwise have resources for sea level rise planning. The San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission (BCDC) is currently creating guidelines to shape local sea level rise plans. 

**Inland Flooding**

Cities must invest in updated stormwater infrastructure to reduce flooding and capture and clean stormwater before it reaches our waterways. In particular, green stormwater infrastructure (GSI) uses natural systems like vegetation, soil, and permeable surfaces to capture stormwater and filter out pollutants. Examples include rain gardens, bioswales, and tree wells. When cities upgrade streets, parks, and other infrastructure, they could be incorporating GSI at the same time, making these new investments more flood resilient. San Mateo County is supporting this kind of integrated planning with their [Sustainable Streets Master Plan](https://www.flowstobay.org/data-resources/plans/sustainable-streets-master-plan/).
