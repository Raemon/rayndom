## About

**Note:** Due to issues with the Accela permitting system and Oakland Citizen Access, some plans and project documents may not currently be available. Please contact the case planner directly for access to the plans and other public documents.

Due to the Shelter-in-Place (SIP) order from Alameda County from September 2019 through May 2021, weekly Applications on File reports were not posted in this archive, but in some cases may be found as records submitted to our **[Online Permit Center](https://aca-prod.accela.com/OAKLAND/Cap/CapHome.aspx?module=Building&TabName=Building)**.

Please help us achieve wider notification by alerting your friends and neighbors if you believe they would be interested in any of these projects. Please note that the descriptions of the applications posted are preliminary in nature and that the projects and/or such descriptions may change prior to a decision being made around their approval, modification, or denial.

#### MINISTERIAL DESIGN REVIEW PROJECTS LOG

[__This spreadsheet(XLSX, 33KB)](/files/assets/city/v/14/planning-amp-building/documents/zo/ministerial-projects-log/ministerial-projects-log_.xlsx "Ministerial-Projects-Log") contains the list of Ministerial Design Review projects under review by the City of Oakland's Planning Bureau. The purpose of this log is to keep you informed of new ministerial projects proposed with addresses so you can easily find them. While these projects are not subject to public comment or review and they are not appealable, we've created this log to keep you informed so you're aware of projects that are proposed near you. This log is records submittals only. You can follow the project along as it progresses by visiting the [Oakland Accela Citizen Access webpage](https://aca-prod.accela.com/OAKLAND/Default.aspx) and searching by the Planning case number. You'll also be able to review the plans and any other submitted documents on that portal. Please note that since these projects are ministerial, the city can and will take action on them at any time without prior notice.
