### What You Need to Know Before You Apply

If you do business or own any kind of rental property (residential, commercial and industrial) in the City of Oakland, you will need to file and pay an annual business tax.

All Oakland based businesses should obtain a Zoning Clearance prior to applying for a Business Tax Certificate. The Zoning Department can be reached at [Zoning Clearance Website](https://aca-prod.accela.com/OAKLAND/customization/common/launchpad.aspx) or (510) 238-3911.

## Application Process

[Apply for a New Business Tax Certificate online](https://ltss.oaklandnet.com/Apply/GettingStarted/BusinessLicense) or at the Business Tax Office.

A non-refundable business registration fee plus special fees (SB1186 State Disability Access and Education Fund and Recordation and Technology), are due within 30 days of the business or rental start date.

In addition, a pre-payment of taxes on estimated first year calendar gross receipts, from start date to December 31, is due. The estimated tax pre-payment will be trued up/down on next year's renewal, creating an amount owed or credit on the account.

For late registrations, 31 - 60 days late add 10%, 61 days late and over add additional 25% (10% + 25% = 35%). Additionally, simple interest at 1% per calendar month is added on registration fee, tax and penalty.

The City accepts payment by cash, check, cashier's check, money order, Mastercard, Visa, Discover Card or an ATM/Debit Card. If an e-mail address is provided, the Business Tax Certificate will be sent in 2-3 business days, otherwise the certificate will be mailed in 7-10 business days after the fee has been paid.

Business tax accounts are not transferable. If you are a new owner, do not use the old owner's business tax account. The old owner should close their business tax account and the new owner should apply for a new business tax account.

**A.** A business will pay tax for their first and second year renewals based on **actual** Gross Receipts/Rents generated for those years. For the third year and all subsequent years thereafter, tax will be based on Gross Receipts/Rents generated in the **prior year**.

Year | Gross Receipts (GR)/Rents Generated  
---|---  
Year 1 of business operation | GR Based on actual  
Year 2 of business operation | GR Based on actual  
Year 3 of business operation | GR Based upon prior actual GR  
  
Below is an example for a business that started in 2020. They generated the following Gross Receipts/Rents for 2020, 2021 and 2022:

Year | Gross Receipts/Rents Generated  
---|---  
2020 | $100,000.00  
2021 | $200,000.00  
2022 | $300,000.00  
  
  * 2020 (first year) will be taxed on their actual Gross Receipts/Rents generated, which were $100,000
  * 2021 (second year) will also be taxed on their actual Gross Receipts/Rents generated, which were $200,000
  * 2022 (third year) will be taxed on the prior year's Gross Receipts/Rents generated, which was $200,000
  * **All subsequent years thereafter will also be taxed on each prior year's Gross Receipts/Rents generated.**
  * 2023 (Fourth year) will be taxed on the prior year's Gross Receipts/Rents generated, which was $300,000



_Please note: Business Tax payment applies to current year's generated gross receipts. If estimated gross receipts from the prior year are lower or higher than the actual gross receipts, the taxpayer will be required to adjust business tax payment._

_Each payment of Business Taxes applies to the current year's license renewal, not the prior year's license. For example, a payment made on or before March 1st, 2024 is recognized as a renewal for its 2024 license._
