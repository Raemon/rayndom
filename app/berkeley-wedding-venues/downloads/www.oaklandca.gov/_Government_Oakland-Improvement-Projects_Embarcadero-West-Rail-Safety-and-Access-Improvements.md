## Project Scope

**Embarcadero West Rail Safety and Access Improvements** will improve safety, access to the waterfront, and train reliability for people and goods movement. It will also transform Embarcadero West into a more welcoming and connected corridor that's reflective of the surrounding community. This project also includes installing railroad safety infrastructure that could qualify the area to be designated as a [quiet zone](https://railroads.dot.gov/railroad-safety/divisions/highway-rail-crossing-and-trespasser-programs/train-horn-rulequiet-zones). Check out the [__Community Design Workshop Posters(PDF, 15MB)](/files/assets/city/v/1/transportation/documents/projects/embarcadero-west-rail-safety/ewrsai-workshop-posters_online-survey.pdf) and the videos showing the design proposals!

  * [Pedestrian Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfdBzxzM9rc)
  * [Bicyclist Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zcpsu178oQ)
  * [Driver Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjb1552kIoI)



The project is currently in early design with the goal of incorporating these proposed improvements:

**Relocate and upgrade eight at-grade crossings gates** on Embarcadero West between Market Street and Oak Street, including new railroad and pedestrian crossing arms and equipment immediately adjacent to the railroad tracks. Other improvements to the at-grade crossings include directional signage, pavement delineation, high-visibility crosswalks, bulb-outs, and intersection safety lighting to increase safety and protect freight and passenger rail operations.

**Install fencing** between intersections to physically separate trains and all other road users.

**Pursue a quiet zone** on Embarcadero West to eliminate routine use of train horns. To establish a quiet zone, railroad safety infrastructure must be installed. In a quiet zone, train horns may still be used in emergency situations or to comply with other Federal regulations or railroad operating rules.

**Install new traffic signals with preemption** (as required by UPRR) at the Broadway and Oak Street intersections with 2nd Street.

**Convert the westbound lane (lane closer to downtown) of Embarcadero West to a shared street.** Embarcadero West **between Jefferson Street and Webster Street** would become a shared street, similar to Water Street, and designed to slow vehicle speeds. Traffic diverters (such as concrete islands and/or bollards) would be constructed at each intersection to ensure right-turns only for drivers on Embarcadero West driving west. Creating right-turn only intersections on westbound Embarcadero West will minimize incidents of vehicles on tracks when trains are approaching and of drivers inadvertently traveling off pavement onto the railroad tracks. The shared street design will include space for loading as appropriate.

**Convert the eastbound lane (lane closer to the waterfront) to a bicycle and pedestrian space on Embarcadero West between Clay Street and Webster Street.** This side of the street will accommodate emergency vehicles and authorized service vehicles but would be closed for general purpose vehicles. Closing this road to vehicles will also eliminate left turns across the railroad tracks, which reduces the risk of vehicle-train and vehicle-pedestrian collisions. It will also make it easier for drivers to travel straight across Embarcadero West to get to and from the waterfront.

**Construct protected bike lanes** to connect major transit stops and the city's network of bike lanes. See proposed bike lanes below and map on page 17 of the [__workshop posters(PDF, 15MB)](/files/assets/city/v/1/transportation/documents/projects/embarcadero-west-rail-safety/ewrsai-workshop-posters_online-survey.pdf).

  * Two-way protected bike lanes on 2nd Street between Martin Luther King Jr. Way and Clay Street and on Clay Street between 2nd Street and Embarcadero West.
  * Two-way separated bike lanes on existing eastbound Embarcadero West between Clay Street and Webster Street.
  * Two-way protected bike lanes on Embarcadero West between Clay Street and Oak Street and on Oak Street between Embarcadero West and 3rd Street.



**Replace parking** on Clay Street between Embarcadero West and 2nd Street and Embarcadero West between MLK Jr Way and Clay Street with wider sidewalks and protected bike lanes.

**Redevelopment of the overweight vehicle corridor between** Middle Harbor Road to Market Street to accommodate permitted trucks between 80,000 – 95,000 pounds. This will restore direct overweight truck access to the overweight truck corridor and eliminate the current overweight truck corridor reroute on 7th Street through West Oakland.

**Study the feasibility of future grade-separated crossings** over Embarcadero West on streets between Adeline Street and Clay Street.

Embarcadero West Rail Safety and Access Improvements will also upgrade blocks perpendicular to the rail corridor between Embarcadero West and 2nd Street on Martin Luther King, Jr. Way to Oak Street and on Market Street between Embarcadero West and 3rd Street. These upgrades will include improvements to street lighting, multi-modal safety, intersection safety, and accessibility.

## Additional Information

## Background

Oakland's Embarcadero West is a vital transportation corridor in the Bay Area, connecting the Port of Oakland—a global gateway for the Northern California Megaregion—to the rest of the nation. Embarcadero West is a one-mile city street accommodating freight trains, passenger trains, motor vehicles, bicyclists, and pedestrians with no physical separation between these transportation modes. Approximately 65 trains a day use this corridor operated by Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR) and Amtrak/Capitol Corridor. This rail corridor is one of the largest bottlenecks for both UPRR and Amtrak, which see frequent delays from vehicles inadvertently getting stuck on the tracks. Decades of community engagement and planning have resulted in multiple state grant awards that will fund this project through the next phases of engagement, final design, and construction.

## Past Engagement

[**2019 Oakland Bike Plan**](https://www.oaklandca.gov/Public-Safety-Streets/Walking-and-Biking-in-Oakland/Bicycle-Planning-Evaluation/Oakland-Bicycle-Plan)  
This Plan proposes a Class 1 bike path on Embarcadero West between Brush Street and Clay Street. See interactive [Existing and Proposed Bikeways map](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/32e8f63fd0bc435f88d73a605c3866cc/?org=oakgis).

[**2019 Downtown Oakland Specific Plan (DOSP)**](https://www.oaklandca.gov/Planning-Building/General-Plan-Neighborhood-Plans/Neighborhood-and-Citywide-Plans/Downtown-Oakland-Specific-Plan-DOSP)  
This plan proposed a rail safety project on Embarcadero West between Market Street and Oak Street that would install crossing treatments and fencing at each intersection and transform Embarcadero West into a "quiet zone" and an enhanced pedestrian corridor (which would provide a safer connection between Howard Terminal to Jack London).

**Draft Howard Terminal Transportation Plan**  
Building upon prior planning efforts, the public was engaged in the conceptual development of the projects in 2019 and 2020 through "on the ground" surveys that reached hundreds of Oaklanders in high priority neighborhoods adjacent to the waterfront, a series of community workshops, and stakeholder meetings as summarized here:

  * In-person engagement included surveys, community meetings, and stakeholder meetings focused on West Oakland, Jack London Square, and Chinatown. Over 500 surveys were conducted in English, Spanish, and Chinese, and happened on-board buses, at transit hubs, and on high-traffic corridors for a total of over 200 hours on the ground. In addition to in-person surveys, online surveys were also advertised to Oaklanders with a specific focus on the 94607 zip code (including West Oakland, Old Oakland, Chinatown, and Jack London Square). The people who took the surveys, according to the demographic questions, were representative of the City's demographics.
  * Four community meetings with about 30 attendees each were held in the neighborhoods of focus, including West Oakland, Jack London Square, Chinatown, and a maritime stakeholder-specific workshop.
  * Ten key stakeholder meetings were held with leaders of each community where projects are proposed to be implemented, and with transportation advocates.
  * Staff made multiple presentations to the Bicyclist and Pedestrian Advisory Commission.



**Final and Draft Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for the Waterfront Ballpark District**  
As a result of the comments received on the Draft EIR, the Embarcadero West Rail Safety and Access Improvements become a larger set of recommended improvements in the Final EIR.

###### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) about Embarcadero West Rail Safety and Access Improvements

## Will this project result in a quiet zone?

This project includes installing railroad safety infrastructure that could qualify the area to be designated as a quiet zone. Local governments have the authority to establish a quiet zone in their jurisdiction if they meet requirements specified by the Federal Rail Administration. Train operators must also agree to comply with a quiet zone. The project team will continue to pursue a quiet zone and coordinate with stakeholders, including Union Pacific Railroad.

## How is this project funded? Can the funding be spent on other pressing issues in Oakland?

The project is funded by state, regional, and potentially federal funds (the City is awaiting the outcome of an outstanding federal grant application). The majority of the project funding comes from [California Assembly Bill 128](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220AB128), which specified the purpose of these funds—to implement improvements that facilitate enhanced freight and passenger access and to promote the efficient and safe movement of goods and people. The existing and potential future grant funds must be spent on this project and cannot be spent on other projects or purposes. The funding must also be spent on capital improvements and cannot be spent on maintenance and operations. This project is not funded by the City of Oakland’s general fund. There are other programs administered by the City of Oakland and by regional agencies, such as the Universal Basic Mobility Pilot in West Oakland, to make transit more affordable for low-income folks: <https://www.oaklandca.gov/topics/universal-basic-mobility>

## If Embarcadero West becomes a one-way street between Clay Street and Webster Street in the westbound direction, how will this affect traffic?

No significant traffic impact is anticipated due to the proposed project. The design was evaluated in the Howard Terminal Environmental Impact Report (EIR), which showed that significant traffic impacts were not expected, even when accounting for 3,500 new housing units and over 1 million square feet of new commercial space in the Howard Terminal Development anticipated at that time. While this initial vehicle data was collected prior to the pandemic, these findings have been supported with additional vehicle data collected in 2024.

Additionally, the project proposes strategies to help drivers navigate and access their destinations safely, including: 

  * Updating directional signage and coordinating with mobile app companies to update wayfinding to direct people to destinations and parking.
  * Designating loading spaces along the shared street so that vehicles can pull over to load/unload or pickup/drop off passengers without blocking traffic.



## How will fire truck and emergency vehicle access be maintained?

The proposed pedestrian path and bike lanes will be designed so that in an emergency, a fire truck or emergency vehicle can drive eastbound on Embarcadero West. The proposed shared street in the westbound direction is designed to accommodate the widths needed for fire trucks and emergency vehicles to turn at all intersections.

## Why are bike lanes a part of this project?

This project provides an opportunity to provide a safe and comfortable bike route between other upcoming protected bike lane projects in West Oakland, Downtown Oakland, and the Jack London District, which creates a more complete and connected bike network.

## How will the bike lanes be separated from the pedestrian path?

The project team is continuing to explore safe and accessible ways to define space for bicyclists and pedestrians. While vertical separation won’t be possible, different colored and textured surfaces help people with vision disabilities navigate the space. Signage and markings will communicate to bicyclists that they must yield to pedestrians and safely share the space. Share your ideas with the project team.

## Will the project include public art?

The project team is gathering feedback on where people would like to see artistic elements included in the project. Ongoing coordination with the City of Oakland Cultural Affairs and Public Art staff will help us understand how to best incorporate elements in terms of timing and funding.

## If the overweight truck corridor is redeveloped, will this bring more truck traffic to the area?

The City of Oakland and the Port of Oakland jointly manage the [Heavy Container Permit Program](https://www.oaklandseaport.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ctmp_HeavyContainerProgram.pdf). Overweight trucks are required to apply for permits, and the Oakland Police Department manages the permitting process. The trucks must only travel on the city streets designated for overweight truck travel. They must also travel at lower speeds. The overweight corridor is expected to make overweight truck travel more efficient and reduce traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) coming specifically from heavy container trucks traveling in residential neighborhoods in West Oakland. Since 2021, the Adeline Bridge was deemed structurally insufficient for overweight trucks. As a result, those trucks have been using 7th Street in West Oakland to travel to/from the Port of Oakland. The overweight corridor will allow overweight trucks to access the Port entrance adjacent to the Adeline Bridge, without traveling on 7th Street. The overweight corridor is and will continue to be a private road accessible only for overweight trucks and emergency vehicles.

## How will on-street parking be affected by this project?

Afull project-wide parking evaluation is forthcoming. All passenger drop-off areas and accessible van access will be maintained. Some on-street parking is expected to be removed to provide daylighting at intersections and near driveways for traffic safety, and due to added bike facilities. The project includes a comprehensive wayfinding plan, which will include wayfinding signage to direct drivers to the many nearby public parking structures.

## How will driveways and loading access be affected by this project?

Currently, no driveways are proposed to be closed. The project team will continue to conduct outreach to understand loading needs along the corridor and will work with businesses to address any potential impacts. The full loading access and driveway evaluation is forthcoming. The project will accommodate loading dock access along Embarcadero West, including on the south (water) side where the pedestrian path and protected bike lanes are proposed.

## How will loading and vehicle access work on the north side of Embarcadero West?

The north side of Embarcadero West (in the westbound direction) will be a shared street between Webster Street and Jefferson Street (which will be similar to Water Street). It is designed for cars to drive at slower speeds and for the roadway to be shared among all modes of transportation. The street will be similar to Water Street (i.e. no sidewalk), so there is space for both passenger loading as well as cars to drive through. At each intersection between Jefferson and Webster Street, cars will have to make a right turn at the next intersection. For example, a car traveling on Embarcadero West towards Broadway will make a right turn at Broadway. The driver video visualizes the improvements: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjb1552kIoI>

## How is this project incorporating sea-level rise elements?

Sea-level rise and its effect on current and planned infrastructure projects is a larger regional consideration with multiple stakeholders. In 2014, Capital Corridor Joint Powers Authority (CCJPA) published[ Sea Level Rise Vulnerability Assessment](https://www.adaptingtorisingtides.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/CCJPA-SLR-Vulnerability-Assessment_Final.pdf).

## Can the railroad be put underground instead of constructing this project?

Lowering the railroad tracks to operate below grade or underground would be a costly, much longer-term endeavor with several design challenges. Some of these challenges and considerations include the proximity to Union Pacific Railroad’s railyard and the grade of trains when switching tracks in and around the yard, the requirement that non-electric locomotives must have an open trench, sea level rise, groundwater intrusion, and the presence of potential hazardous materials and their disposal.

## Can this project bring back the B shuttle?

The project team has heard a lot of support from residents and business owners for bringing back the B Shuttle as a free transportation option between Downtown Oakland and Jack London District. Unfortunately, the B shuttle is currently suspended. Any updates about the B shuttle will be shared on the B shuttle webpage: <https://www.oaklandca.gov/topics/free-broadway-shuttle>
