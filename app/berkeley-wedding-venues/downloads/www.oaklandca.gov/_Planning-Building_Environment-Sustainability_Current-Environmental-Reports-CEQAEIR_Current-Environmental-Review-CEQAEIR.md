A number of the NOP public comment letters that were submitted to the City via e-mail included attachments which are only viewable in the on-line DEIR if the PDF document is downloaded. For ease of viewing we are adding this supplement of those attachments here in a separate PDF that does not require a download of the entire DEIR document to view. It should also be noted that all of the aforementioned emails and attachments/letters are included in the Administrative Record for the project, and comments in the letters were taken into consideration in preparation of the Draft EIR.

The Draft EIR included a GHG Reduction Plan, as required by the City's Standard Condition of Approval, which was provided for in Appendix G of the DEIR. The initial intent was to include the CalEEMod calculations in an attachment (Attachment A) to the Appendix. However, the attachment was inadvertently omitted. While the data has been in the Administrative record, the City is posting the information here as initially intended.
