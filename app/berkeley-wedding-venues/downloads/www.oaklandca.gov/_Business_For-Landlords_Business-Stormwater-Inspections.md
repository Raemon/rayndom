## Why Do We Inspect Businesses?

The City inspects non-residential, non-mobile industrial and commercial business types within Oakland that are reasonably likely to contribute pollutants, such as chemicals and trash, to stormwater. In Oakland, all storm drains lead directly to creeks, lakes, and the San Francisco Bay. Only clean stormwater is permitted in the City's storm drain system.

These inspections help protect water quality and the City of Oakland comply with section C.4 Industrial and Commercial Site Controls, of the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board's [Municipal Regional Stormwater Permit, Order No. R2-2022-0018 (Clean Water Permit)](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/sanfranciscobay/water_issues/programs/stormwater/MRP/mrp5-22/R2-2022-0018.pdf) and [Oakland Municipal Code Section 13.16.070, Creek Protection, Storm Water Management and Discharge Control](https://library.municode.com/ca/oakland/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=TIT13PUSE_CH13.16CRPRSTWAMADICO_ARTIIDIRERE_13.16.070DIPO).

## Inspection Frequency

The City inspects industrial and commercial businesses in Oakland that have outdoor storage and/or processes, handle hazardous materials, and/or pose other stormwater pollution risks.

**Inspected every 2 years:** Businesses subject to the [Statewide General Permit for Stormwater Discharges Associated with Industrial Activities, Order 2014-0057-DWQ (Industrial General Permit)](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/stormwater/igp_20140057dwq.html) or that are defined by the [Oakland Municipal Code Chapter 17.10](https://library.municode.com/ca/oakland/codes/planning_code?nodeId=TIT17PL_CH17.10USCL) as Industrial (not already registered as IGP) are classified as "Industrial."

**Inspected every 5 years:** Businesses that involve activities defined by the Oakland Municipal Code Chapter 17.10 as Commercial are classified as "commercial."

## Inspection Schedule

Initial inspections are usually not scheduled ahead of time with the business.

Re-inspections are conducted at additional cost within a prescribed time after an initial inspection documents violations, and if the business has not provided adequate documentation of corrected violations.

Additional inspections may be scheduled in response to complaints of stormwater violations.

Save money, time, and the environment by complying with laws and preventing stormwater pollution.

## What Do Inspectors Look For, and How Are Violations Handled?

The inspection(s) covered how well your business is preventing stormwater pollution. For example, the inspector typically reviews litter outside the business, trash/recycling/compost management, hazardous material storage and disposal, wash water disposal, relevant record keeping and staff training, cleaning, and other practices. Compliance with food ware and waste, as well as [fats, oil, and grease (FOG)](mailto:) management requirements are evaluated where applicable.

Required corrective actions for violations observed during the inspection are documented in inspection report(s) emailed and mailed to the business representative after the inspection(s). **The business must submit proof of correction to[BSIP@oaklandca.gov](mailto:BSIP@oaklandca.gov) to clear violations.**

Uncleared violations may trigger additional contact and inspections from the City at additional cost to the business.

## Inspection scores

Each inspection is scored.

P4 is passing, P3 indicates minor corrections required, and P1 indicates more significant corrective actions needed.

Required corrective actions for violations observed during the inspection are documented in the inspection report(s) and in email(s) sent to the business representative after the inspection(s).

## Inspection fees, invoices, payment options, and late payment penalties

Soon after the inspection, the business will be sent an invoice via email and US Post.

A flat rate is charged for an initial inspection according to facility type. Additional hourly rate charges are charged for re-inspections. A 14.75% administrative fee is charged to cover electronic records management and technology licensing fees. Inspection fees are listed under "Stormwater Inspection Fees" in the [City of Oakland’s Master Fee Schedule.](https://www.oaklandca.gov/Government/Finance-Budget/Financial-Reporting/City-of-Oakland-Master-Fee-Schedules)

**Late Fees**

If not paid before 60 days, a late fee of 10% of the initial invoice amount will be applied to the invoice.

If not paid before 90 days, another late fee of 10% of the initial invoice amount will be applied to the invoice.

Invoices 120 days past due will result in consequences including, but not limited to, referral to collections, additional fees, and/or legal action.

## Is this related to drinking water? (no, expand for explantion)

No. "Stormwater" refers to rainwater that falls on the ground and then enters the City's streets, gutters, and storm drain pipe system which connect to creeks and San Francisco Bay. Stormwater is separate from drinking water and from the sanitary sewer.

## Legal Obligations for Businesses to Prevent Storm Water Pollution

All storm drains in Oakland lead directly to creeks, lakes, and the Bay.

Businesses are required by law to prevent storm water pollution from their business site and operations.

Discharge of foreign material into the storm drain or street violates Oakland's [Creek Protection and Storm Water Management and Discharge Control Ordinance (Oakland Municipal Code section 13.16.07)](https://library.municode.com/ca/oakland/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=TIT13PUSE_CH13.16CRPRSTWAMADICO_ARTIIDIRERE_13.16.070DIPO), pollutes waterways, can damage sensitive habitats, and can kill wildlife.

If wastes and wash waters from a business enters the storm drain system, that business may have to pay clean up costs and fines, have permits revoked, or even go to jail for causing storm water pollution.

## Mobile businesses (Pet grooming, power washing, fleet fueling, etc.)

Mobile businesses like carpet cleaners and car detailers typically generate wastewater at the place of activity, often outdoors. However, wash water from mobile business activities must not be drained into gutters or storm drains.

Follow the practices below to prevent pollution. Best management practices (BMPs) guides for specific businesses are listed at the bottom of the page.

  * Plan ahead. Determine where you will discharge wash water before starting a new job. Be sure to have equipment on hand (i.e. long hoses, sump pump, etc.) for directing discharge to sanitary sewer access points.
  * Contain and divert wash water so that it does not drain down streets and gutters, using sand bag berms, wattles or bermed mats.
  * Filter wash water to remove hair (mobile pet groomers) and fibers (Mobile carpet cleaners) before discharging to the sewer system.
  * Discharge wash water properly into a cleanout, sink, toilet or other drain connected to the sanitary sewer system, never into a stormdrain.



Surface Cleaner Training! If your business cleans outdoor surfaces, such as plazas or parking lots, you can get a [certificate of training](https://basmaa.org/featured-programs-projects/surface-cleaning-program/) through the Bay Area Municipal Stormwater Collaborative. This certificate is required by many municipalities.
