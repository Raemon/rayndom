Diablo magazine’s June issue features "Held Captive," the fascinating story of the now world-renowned hikers from the East Bay who were arrested for trespassing in Iran: Shane Bauer, Josh Fattal, and Sarah Shourd. The trio tell the story about their time in Tehran’s notorious Evin Prison and how that experience has redirected their life plans. Also in the June issue is "The Ultimate Father’s Day Gift Guide," which highlights local celebrities: Frank Somerville, anchor of KTVU-2’s 10 o’clock News; Nick Punto, infielder for the Oakland A’s; and Matt Greco, the executive chef from The Restaurant at Wente Vineyards. 

The hikers’ story in Diablo tells of the three young American UC Berkeley graduates on vacation in Iraq Kurdistan, a pro-American region. During a hike on a recommended trail, the trio accidentally crossed, or were lured, into Iran. The three expected to be released within days of their capture, but the ordeal lasted two years. In September 2010, Iran released Shourd on humanitarian grounds. She had been held for 14 months. "I thought as soon as I got out of solitary confinement that everything would be OK," Shourd states. "But it takes years for the nervous system to get back to normal." When Shourd got home, she took a lead role in the Free the Hikers campaign. She met with dozens of U.S. and foreign officials for assistance in the release of the two men still in prison, including President Obama, then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, then president of Iran. The three hikers have recounted their stories in their new memoir, A Sliver of Light: Three Americans Imprisoned in Iran, published this spring. The full story can be read on Diablo magazine’s digital edition or on the website at: [http://www.diablomag.com/June-2014/Held-Captive/](http://www.diablomag.com/June-2014/Held-Captive/).
