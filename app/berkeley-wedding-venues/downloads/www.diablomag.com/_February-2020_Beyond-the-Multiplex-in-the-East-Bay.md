The 92nd Academy Awards ceremony takes place February 9, showcasing the high marks of Hollywood’s past year. The best shot our region has to bring home Oscar gold is Pixar’s _Toy Story 4_ , which could earn the Emeryville studio its 10th Best Animated Feature award. (The East Bay reference of the year came in Martin Scorsese’s mafia epic _The Irishman_ , when Joe Pesci’s character ordered a hit in Walnut Creek.)

Fortunately, the end of Oscar season doesn’t mean there’s a shortage of top-shelf cinema to be found in the East Bay. Here’s a roundup of places to see art house and foreign-language films on the big screen.

#### **International Film Showcase**

This fabulous series launched in 2011 as a way to bring foreign-language films to the suburbs. Series cofounder Efi Lubliner highlights prestigious pictures from far corners of the world—movies that often receive no other distribution in the area. One week each month, the International Film Showcase selection is shown at the Orinda Theatre, with additional screenings scheduled at the El Campanil Theatre in Antioch and the Jarvis Conservatory in Napa. This month, the showcase presents Pedro Almodóvar’s _Pain and Glory_ , featuring Antonio Banderas in a career-best performance. In March, the true-crime drama _The Traitor_ , by Italian director Marco Bellocchio, makes its East Bay debut. _[internationalshowcase.org](http://internationalshowcase.org)_.

#### **Mountain Shadow Film Society**

This monthly series at the Walnut Creek Library also provides quality international movies. In February, the society screens a selection of animated, documentary, and live-action short films nominated for Academy Awards. Showings take place February 14 (at 7:30 p.m.), and February 15 and 22 (at 4:30 and 7:30 p.m.). While most seats are reserved for Mountain Shadow members, a limited number of $12 tickets are available to the general public 30 minutes before each event. An annual membership costs $120. _[mountainshadow.org](http://mountainshadow.org)_.

#### **Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive**

Berkeley used to be rep–movie house heaven, with an abundance of theaters screening the best of world cinema every day. Most of those venues are gone, save for this treasure of a film center, which presents expertly curated programs, often with guest speakers. This month’s offerings include a retrospective of Romanian cinema and films by Alfred Hitchcock, Federico Fellini, and David Lynch. _[bampfa.org](http://bampfa.org)_.

### Park Theater 2.0

Those who remember the Park Theater in Lafayette as the region’s original destination for art house and foreign-language cinema will be thrilled to learn that there is a new effort underway to resurrect the venue, which has been dark since 2005. An anonymous donor recently pledged $2 million toward the acquisition and renovation of the Art Deco landmark, and the nonprofit Park Theater Trust hopes to reopen the theater as a film, arts, and culture hub. _[parktheatertrust.org](http://parktheatertrust.org)_.

### Screening the Classics

For those who complain, "They don’t make movies like the used to," there are a number of local places to see Hollywood classics on the big screen. _Diablo_ sponsors the Classic Film Series at the Orinda Theatre, presenting a free screening of a beloved older movie the second Thursday evening of each month. The Alameda Theatre in Alameda, Rialto Cinemas Cerrito theater in El Cerrito, Paramount Theatre in Oakland, and Vine Cinema and Alehouse in Livermore also frequently add classic films to their lineups. _[orindamovies.com](http://orindamovies.com), [alamedatheatres.com](http://alamedatheatres.com), [rialtocinemas.com](http://rialtocinemas.com), [paramounttheatre.com](http://paramounttheatre.com), [vinecinema.com](http://vinecinema.com)_.
