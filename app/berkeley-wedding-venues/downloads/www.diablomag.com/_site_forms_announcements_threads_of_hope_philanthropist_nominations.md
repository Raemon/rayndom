  * Finish



Thank you for submitting a Philanthropist nomination for the 2025 Threads of Hope Award.We have developed the following award criteria to help identify the type of philanthropic changemaker we hope to honor this year. While your nominee does not need to meet all of these criteria to qualify, they can serve as a starting point for telling your honoree’s unique story of giving back and lifting up the East Bay community:

• **Equity** : Actions that work towards creating inclusive systems and communities where all individuals, regardless of race, class, gender, age, sexual orientation, or ability, can participate, reach their full potential, and live with safety and dignity.  
• **Resilience** : Actions that strengthen the community's ability to adapt and recover in the face of adversity, tragedy, and trauma.  
• **Creativity** : Actions that are innovative and break old patterns that no longer serve the community, reimagining what is possible.  
• **Compassion** : Actions rooted in care and empathy for others, where giving is a demonstration of compassion without expectation of anything in return.  
• **Risk-taking** : Actions that demonstrate the courage to do things differently, breaking the status quo to advance the common good.  
• **Sustained Commitment** : Actions that demonstrate a steadfast commitment to long-term change in the community.

**Examples of Philanthropy Nominees**  
• Individuals who provide their personal time, talent, and treasure to local nonprofits.  
• Corporate philanthropists and executives who champion transformational grants and matching gifts to East Bay nonprofits as a core part of their mission.  
• Small business owners who partner with nonprofits and showcase creativity in community giving.  
• Foundations and their staff who take risks with their giving and provide stability to nonprofits through sustained gifts.

Note: WWe recommend drafting your answers to the following questions in a separate document to avoid any potential loss of progress in case of connectivity issues. Once you've finalized your responses, you can simply copy and paste them into the form.
