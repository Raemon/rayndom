#### BEST MONSTER BIRTHDAY PARTY

**MONSTER TRUCK GARAGE, BRENTWOOD**

Hoping to bring some shock and awe to your child’s next birthday party? Look no further than Monster Truck Garage, whose fleet of massive “mechanical beasts” adds big excitement to special events. Invite a jacked-up 2019 GMC Sierra 2500 HD Denali, a 1999 Ford F650 Harley-Davidson Monster Truck, and Storm Trooper, with its 5,000-watt stereo system, to come to your gathering. Or check out Monster Truck Garage’s on-site birthday room in Brentwood, with themed decor and 30-minute monster truck rides for up to 16 guests. _[monstertruckgarage.com](http://monstertruckgarage.com)._

#### BEST PLACE TO MAKE A SPLASH

**THE WAVE, DUBLIN**

Nothing says summer like slaloming down a spiraling waterslide. The Wave waterpark has been welcoming thrill seekers and swimmers to its location in Emerald Glen Park since 2017, providing access to six waterslides, two pools, and a splash zone. The waterpark is open from Memorial Day Weekend through Labor Day, but guests can swim year-round at the indoor Natatorium pool. The Wave introduced a new program called Sensory Splash in fall 2024 to provide a calm space for children who are neurodiverse or have special needs, held on select Sundays from October through April. During Sensory Splash, the music is turned off, admission is limited, and lifeguards refrain from using whistles except in cases of emergency.  _[thedublinwave.com](http://thedublinwave.com)._

#### BEST SUPPORT FOR NEW FAMILIES

**LITTLE SEEDS FAMILY, LAFAYETTE**

When Kat Neill and Lauren Locke saw a gap in prenatal and postpartum in-person services in the Lamorinda area, they founded Little Seeds Family to fill that need. Since opening their Lafayette location last summer, the pair has collaborated with local providers to host a variety of prenatal, postpartum, and parenting classes. Offerings geared toward parent-baby bonding include Infant Massage and Mommy and Me Yoga, as well as open play hours for kids ages 0–4 and postpartum support sessions for moms and babies. “We are both moms, and we know it can be very lonely,” says Locke. “We want to help people create their village of support.” Adds Neill, “Motherhood isn’t meant to be done alone.” _[littleseedsfamily.com](http://littleseedsfamily.com)._

### Best Party Venue

**LINDSAY WILDLIFE EXPERIENCE, WALNUT CREEK**

Lindsay Wildlife Experience, now in its 70th year, fosters a love of animals; provides education about our natural world; and cares for ill, injured, and orphaned wild creatures at its hospital. It is also an unforgettable party space that includes up-close animal interactions in its two birthday packages (available only on weekends). Among the animal ambassadors who might join the young guests are rabbits, snakes, a tortoise, chuckwallas, guinea pigs, and raptors. The party packages include free admission to the exhibit hall and a stuffed animal for the birthday child, along with plenty of room for fun. Plus, every celebration helps support Lindsay in its ongoing commitment to connecting people with wildlife for generations to come. _[lindsaywildlife.org](http://lindsaywildlife.org)._
