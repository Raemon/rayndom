[Click here to follow along with Chef Dong Choi, chef de cuisine at The Slanted Door San Ramon, as he walks  _Diablo_ 's Food Editor Ethan Fletcher through the recipe during the San Ramon episode of "East Bay Eats.](https://www.diablomag.com/travel-places/getaways/city-series-insider-s-guide-to-san-ramon/article_24d62d56-8465-11eb-a074-c79e285b2a46.html#EastBayEats)"

This dish is an ode to a classic Vietnamese cooking technique of cooking in clay pots. It is a one-pot meal that celebrates the bounty of spring in the Bay Area and that can be quickly thrown together with a little prep ahead of time.

You would want a claypot that can hold at least 32 ounces, but depending on size of the cooking vessel you can change the amount of fish or vegetables (special note on claypots: before use, soak them covered in water for at least 24 hours to prevent cracking when exposed to direct heat).

Serves 3-4. 

### 

### **Ingredients:**

8-10oz of wild alaskan halibut fillet, skin off (or any similar white fish)

24oz of mushroom broth (can substitute chicken stock or water if desired)

1lb mushroom trim or whole mushrooms

4 quarts of water

1lb of white fish bones

1 small shallot cut in half NOT peeled

1 clove of garlic, lightly smashed NOT peeled

1 tablespoon Chinese lite soy sauce

1 teaspoon fish sauce (son’s fish sauce extra virgin; try and find fish sauce without additives and sugar)

1 teaspoon of Chinese dark soy sauce

4oz or 2-3 stalk of jumbo delta asparagus, peeled and cut into 1 inch pieces (Zuckerman Farms)

3-4 small Tokyo turnips peeled and washed and cut into 1/4’s (County Line Farms)

2oz each of shiitake mushrooms, hen of the woods, yellow foot chanterelles (Can substitute any fresh mushroom wild or cultivated available to you; King of Mushrooms)

3oz Shanghai Bok Choy, cut off root end, and gently peel away outer leaves. Split half lengthwise the core (Chong Farms San Ramon)

1 small bunch of räu ram leaves gently torn 

2 scallion whites, finely sliced 

2oz of cellophane noodles

Sea salt

Freshly ground pepper

1 tablespoon of shallot oil (optional, can also substitute olive oil)

### **Directions:**

**To make broth: (can be done up to 3 days ahead)**

Save trim from mushrooms, add to large pot, with 4 quarts of water, 1 small shallot, 1 clove of garlic, and 1lb of the bones of the halibut.

First bring fish bones covered with cold water together in pot to a boil.

Dump water, and rinse bones well.

Rinse same stock pot, return to heat and then add the 4 quarts of cold water, the clean bones, shallot and garlic. Bring to hard simmer, reduce heat and gently simmer for 1.5 hours.

Remove from heat, strain through fine mesh strainer, discard solids. You should have about 2-2.5 quarts of broth. Add fish sauce and soy sauces, stir to combine.

Taste. Finish with salt to taste.

**To make noodles: (Can be made day ahead and kept wrapped tightly in fridge)**

Bring 1 quart of water to boil, pour over dried cellophane noodles. 

Let sit for 10 minutes, then drain, and rinse with cold water.

Drain and squeeze out any remaining liquid. Set aside. 

**To make Claypot Wild Alaskan Halibut:**

With claypot set over medium low to preheat, season fish with sea salt and pepper on both sides.

Add broth to claypot, add cellophane noodles, nestle fish on top of noodles. 

Gently place all vegetables in layers around the fish, cover with more broth if needed, you want the broth to just come up to top of the sides of the fish.

Cover, bring to hard simmer, then drop heat to low, and cook for 10-12 minutes or until fish is desired donees, fish should easily pierce with knife with little to almost no resistance. Turn off heat.

Scatter Scallions, räu ram, and pour shallot oil on top, cover for 1 minute to gently wilt the herbs. Remove from heat and transfer entire claypot to heatproof underliner.

Bring claypot directly to table, serve family style with jasmine rice.
