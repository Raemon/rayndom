Daniella Pineda has appeared in multiple projects on the big and small screen this year.

Jonny Marlow

When Daniella Pineda was envisioning her future while studying radio journalism and sociology at Mills College in Oakland, she dreamed of NPR, not Hollywood.

Graduating during a recession, however, inspired her to rethink that career plan, and the Oakland-raised Pineda moved to New York City, hoping to work in independent film or get on _The Daily Show._ “I love comedy, and it seemed like a match made in heaven,” she says. “I actually tested for _The Daily Show,_ and I got really close.”

After gaining attention for her humorous YouTube videos, Pineda earned parts on several TV series, including _The Vampire Diaries_ spin-off _The Originals_ on the CW and _Homeland,_ Showtime’s political thriller starring Claire Danes and Mandy Patinkin.

#### "[Anaïs in]  _The_  _Accountant 2_ was one of the best roles that I’ve ever gotten to play. One of my criticisms about women in film is that there are not enough antiheroes."

“ _Homeland_ was my first big job. Mandy Patinkin was so lovely and kind,” she says. “I was very transparent with him. I was like, ‘Hey, this is my first big job and I’m so nervous.’ I couldn’t have asked for a nicer human being.”

Some 13 years later, Pineda has built a solid résumé in TV and film, portraying a paleo-veterinarian in the _Jurassic World_ series, a bounty hunter in _Cowboy Bebop,_ a mystery woman in _The Accountant 2,_ and most recently, an archaeology icon in _Dora and the Search for Sol Dorado_ (the latest entry in the Dora the Explorer franchise that began streaming on Paramount+ in July), among other projects.

“[Anaïs in] _The Accountant_ _2_ was one of the best roles that I’ve ever gotten to play,” says Pineda. “One of my criticisms about women in film is that there are not enough antiheroes—there aren’t any real badass antiheroes. You don’t see a character like the Joker for women.”

Working with star Ben Affleck on the action movie—released this April—had another upside as production took place in Los Angeles, where Pineda now makes her home. 

“I think that it’s a shame that so many productions have moved outside of California,” says Pineda, who held a sign reading "Shoot Movies in California" at the L.A. premiere for _The Accountant 2._ “The community that I’ve made here—these are people with lives and children and education that they are trying to pay for. It’s an entire ecosystem. It’s a shame that an entire industry that put food on the table for a lot of people has gone away, and it doesn’t have to be like that.”

#### "[Dora the Explorer is] about traveling and seeing the rewards ... of learning about other cultures and languages. I feel like we could use a little more Dora in our lives."

##### —Daniella Pineda

Pineda is also passionate about the environment and representing her Mexican American heritage on film; she was recognized with the Outstanding Performance Impact Award by the National Hispanic Media Coalition in June.

“Just being seen and put in a project is quite important. I was really honored to receive that award,” she says. “You know what I love about being part of the Dora [the Explorer] franchise, especially given the current political climate? Dora is all about education. She’s all about traveling and seeing the rewards ... of learning about other cultures and languages. I feel like we could use a little more Dora in our lives.”

Although Pineda has done several action projects, she still loves comedy; she appeared in the TV series _Bad Thoughts_ in May, a humorously twisted Netflix show created by podcaster and stand-up comic Tom Segura.

“I’ll always take a job, even if it’s an instructional animal proctology video for educational purposes. I’ll take the paycheck and [will work in] anything and everything. But as a writing medium, I love to write horror,” says Pineda, who is currently drafting her second horror script and wants to direct her film projects in the genre down the line. “I love acting, and I hope I get to do it for as long as I can. But I love writing as much as I do performing.”

#### "I hated [losing my home in the Eaton Fire], but ... I did a lot of growing up; it revealed what is important. Say what you will about L.A., but I was here during a disaster, and people really showed up for each other."

##### —Daniella Pineda

Sadly, Pineda was one of the many residents of Los Angeles who lost everything to the massive wildfires in January. Pineda’s house in Altadena, her first home purchased just four months earlier, burned down in the Eaton Fire—leaving the actress with nothing but her dog, her laptop, and a pair of shoes.

“The grieving process comes and it goes. It was just horrendous and scary,” says Pineda. “All the houses on my street were 100 years old. People in that community had been there for such a long time. I hated it, but I think I did a lot of growing up; it revealed what is important. Say what you will about L.A., but I was here during a disaster, and people really showed up for each other. I’m going to hopefully rebuild.”

Pineda still has family in Oakland and San Leandro and comes back to the East Bay often. She loves the Grand Lake area and Jack London Square. She grew up in East Oakland, in the same general area as director Ryan Coogler, who got his start chronicling the tragic death of Oscar Grant in the 2013 biographical drama _Fruitvale Station._

“My family and I actually knew Oscar Grant because he worked at the deli counter at Farmer Joe’s [Marketplace], and we would deliver our salsa [there]. It was such a small community,” she recalls.

The East Bay’s Daniella Pineda stars in _Dora and the Search for Sol Dorado,_ now streaming on Paramount+.

She considers Coogler inspirational, as both a local and as a creator. Says Pineda, “I have this distinct memory of going to see _Black Panther_ in theaters, and the trailer for my movie [_Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom_] was playing. I remember being excited about _Black Panther_ being in Oakland and thinking, _Oh, someone can come from [Oakland], make it … and create something original for everyone to enjoy.”_
