Carmel Beach is one of the scenic destinations along the Central Coast.

Courtesy of Visit Carmel-by-the-Sea

Azure waters and a craggy, curving coastline are part of the remarkable view as you drive down Highway 1 through the Marina dunes. Once you travel inland to the enclave of **Carmel Valley,** the rocky cliffs morph into the emerald Santa Lucia hills. The Monterey Bay region has long been a favorite destination for its temperate climate, sublime beaches, and welcoming recreational opportunities, and Carmel Valley serves as both a restorative refuge and an ideal home base for your explorations.

Make a small detour to **Carmel-by-the-Sea,** an idyllic coastal town about 20 minutes away from Carmel Valley that boasts a proud history as an artists’ colony. **Carmel Beach,** a prime example of the region’s dog-friendly ethos, is a popular spot for walking, surfing, and enjoying a warm fire. Down Scenic Road, **Carmel River State Beach,** usually a little more secluded, also offers unmatched sea views. 

Before you leave, head up **Ocean Avenue** to poke your head into the many shops in the neighborhood. **Cottage of Sweets, Carmel Music Box Company,** and the **Pleasure of Writing** are among those that stock beautiful keepsakes. **Carmel Plaza** —which includes national retailers such as **Anthropologie, Bottega Veneta,** and **Athleta** —provides an upscale outlet for additional retail therapy.

### **Vitality Among the Vines**

Head away from the coastline toward the 28-acre **Bernardus Lodge and Spa** for rest and rejuvenation among the vineyards. With its cluster of red and gold adobe-like dwellings, the property is made for wandering—you’ll encounter fruit trees, vine-covered arbors, and even beehives in the bucolic setting. An elegant Valley Villa Suite, which features dual fireplaces and private spa-like amenities such as rain showers and copper soaking tubs, is an ideal indulgence among the 73 guest rooms, suites, and villas. 

A Michelin Two Key–rated and Forbes Four Star hotel, Bernardus is a true epicenter for wellness, offering a variety of options to begin your 2026 health and fitness resolutions. Start your day on the balcony with a Nespresso before heading off to yoga by the pool or reading by the infinity Jacuzzi, a great spot for watching the morning fog clear off the hills. Those who prefer active wellness can take advantage of a well-equipped fitness center, engage in a lively match on the tennis courts, or take part in a spirited game of bocce or croquet on the lawn. 

The resort’s Lucia Restaurant and Bar also prioritizes farm-to-table, seasonal eating and highlights Monterey County’s agricultural bounty. Try the eggs Benedict for breakfast, a midday Bernardus Burger, or the dinner porcini mushroom ravioli. Finish the evening with the crème brûlée—featuring local berries and Madagascar vanilla—near the firepit on the restaurant’s patio. The kitchen draws from the on-site chef’s garden, which is open to guests enjoying a stroll, as is the resplendent rose garden. The resort also hosts temperance cocktail workshops, during which attendees watch an expert handcraft nonalcoholic drinks such as an aperol spritz with Lyre’s Italian Orange and a Pomegranate Nojito with simple syrup. The eye-catching, health-conscious adult beverage alternatives are perfect for Dry January and are easy to re-create once you get home.

In addition to classic treatments like facials and massages, the Spa at Bernardus features more unique wellness services. Sign up for a reiki experience—a stress-relieving ancient Japanese healing practice involving the body’s energies—or a brain wave vibration meditation session that incorporates movement into your mindfulness practice. Moon manifestation workshops, which tie goal setting to celestial forces, and tarot card readings can help you reflect on your past experiences and craft future milestones. Throughout January, guests are welcome to take part in [Resolution Weekends](https://www.bernarduslodge.com/spas-in-carmel-ca/wellness) and work on their goals for the new year.

### **Agrarian Bounty**

The epicurean and outdoor attractions of Carmel Valley extend beyond the resort. February and March are perfect months to visit, as **Earthbound Farm’s Farm Stand,** about a 10-minute drive down Carmel Valley Road from Bernardus, hosts visitors for tulip picking during this timeframe. While you’re there, walk around the gardens, stop for a pastry and a smoothie, and purchase locally grown organic produce to take home with you. 

**Carmel Valley Village** is a hub for enjoying Monterey County’s superb wines, with more than 20 tasting rooms in the area, including one for **Bernardus** winery. **Carmel Valley Creamery** makes artisanal cheese and gives visitors the chance to watch the process through an observation window.

### **Taste of the Valley**

At **Carmel Valley Art Association Gallery,** visitors can find creative inspiration in the works of more than 30 of the area’s artists who produce paintings, mosaics, jewelry, and more. In the town of Carmel, many regional artists showcase their craft in galleries at the **Barnyard Shopping Village,** where you can also find specialty stores selling wine, tea, and chocolate amid clothing boutiques. **From Scratch Restaurant,** which was featured on _Diners, Drive-ins and Dives_ and will celebrate its 50th anniversary next year, is a standout among the center’s eateries; make sure to try the cinnamon roll pancakes. **Carmel Valley Coffee Roasting Company** also serves steaming cups of Joe and coffee beans with locally inspired names such as the Foglifter and Eastwood, in honor of famed actor and onetime Carmel-by-the-Sea mayor Clint Eastwood. 

If you find peace in the outdoors, **Garland Ranch Regional Park** provides plenty of elevation changes for avid hikers, and golfers will love courses such as the **Preserve Golf Club,** which is situated in the midst of the 20,000-acre Santa Lucia nature preserve. From December to May, the nearby **Point Lobos State Natural Reserve** also plays host to migrating gray whales, in addition to regular appearances from otters, sea lions, seals, and countless other creatures who make their home on the coast. 

From the wooded hills to the agricultural fields to the proximity to the sea, a Carmel Valley trip puts you close to the variety of natural wonders in the Monterey Bay area—giving you a deep breath of fresh air before embarking on everything the year has in store.
