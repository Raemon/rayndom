**BOOK: The Setup: A True Story of Dirty Cops, Soccer Moms, and Reality TV**

RELEASE DATE: January 13, 2015 AUTHOR: Pete Crooks, Senior Editor, Diablo magazine

Pete Crooks, Senior Editor, Diablo magazine, is releasing his first published book, The Setup: A True Story of Dirty Cops, Soccer Moms, and Reality TV—a full-picture account of the Central Contra Costa County Narcotics Enforcement Team scandal of 2011. Diablo magazine will feature an interview with Crooks as the cover story of its January 2015 issue.

Author Crooks thought he was writing about a new reality show that was scheduled to start filming in the East Bay when he found himself in the middle of one of the Bay Area’s wildest police corruption scandals—a story that rocked headlines when it revealed stolen drugs, dirty DUIs, and suburban prostitution. Crooks’ reporting uncovered an intricate criminal conspiracy that involved five corrupt police officers, a dirty private investigator, and an unethical family law attorney—all of whom were later sentenced in federal court. Crooks’ story has been featured on 48 Hours and This American Life.

The original pitch went like this: Chris Butler, a retired cop, ran a private investigation firm in Concord, California. His business had a fascinating angle: His firm was staffed entirely by soccer moms. In fact, Butler employed PI Super Moms: attractive, organized, smart, and trained in investigative techniques, self-defense, and weaponry. When this story came across Crooks’ desk at Diablo magazine in 2010, he was instantly hooked. He’d heard a little bit about Butler and his super moms in the news; they’d been featured in People magazine and on Dr. Phil. What Butler’s publicist was offering was too tantalizing to pass up: an opportunity to ride along with Butler and a few of his sexy PIs as they prepared to start filming a reality TV show.

But after the ride-along—and after he began receiving mysterious e-mails from one of Butler’s employees—Crooks started to realize something didn’t seem right. After doing a little digging, he discovered the "sting" he’d seen only had one real victim: him. The PI bust had been a setup.

Crooks wasn’t a hard-boiled crime reporter. He did lifestyle pieces for Diablo magazine, a regional publication. The more he learned about Butler’s operation, the more he realized he was in far over his head, and he soon found himself deep in the underbelly of fake sting operations, wannabe celebrities, police corruption, drug dealing, reality television, double-crossing employees, and more twists and turns than a dozen crime thrillers. The book expands considerably on all previous reporting about the scandal, with exclusive new interviews from the California Department of Justice agents who conducted the investigation and other key characters who had yet to be interviewed about the scandal. The Setup: A True Story of Dirty Cops, Soccer Moms, and Reality TV is a riveting true crime thriller and a darkly humorous examination of how far some people were willing to go for a shot at 15 minutes of fame.

Barney Fonzi, Group Publisher of _Diablo_ magazine, states, "We’re very proud that Pete’s amazing story is being published as a book. Pete has continued to show an incredible amount of dedication, tenacity, and true journalistic integrity in reporting his award-winning story for _Diablo_ magazine’s readers, and at the same time providing a valuable service to our community."
