#  _Diablo_ Magazine Launches the Second _Walnut Creek Book_

##  _The Diablo City Book series highlights the cities and towns of the East Bay.  
The second release of_ The Walnut Creek Book _will be available soon, featuring all new fun and exciting information about the city._

[ _Diablo_ magazine](http://www.diablomag.com "Diablo magazine website") announced the release of the second edition of _The Walnut Creek Book,_ one of four city books in an annual series of publications highlighting the cities and towns of the East Bay. _The Walnut Creek Book_ features hot tips, fascinating personalities, and in-depth resources for enjoying the city of Walnut Creek to its fullest.

Whether you’re a first-time visitor or a long-time resident, you’ll discover the treasures that make the city so unique. The new release will have expanded coverage on the exciting entertainment and dining scene, arts, shopping, and recreation—all areas in which Walnut Creek is highly regarded.

A must-have resource, _The Walnut Creek Book_ will be available at local travel information venues, hotels, advertiser locations, the Broadway Plaza Concierge, and the Walnut Creek Chamber of Commerce/Visitors Bureau. It also will be mailed to select homes with _Diablo_ magazine.

"The first release of _The Walnut Creek Book_ was so well received that we have published a second edition," says Barney Fonzi, Publisher of _Diablo_ magazine. "Our readers have commented that the city books are something the refer to frequently and keep on their coffee tables as a useful reference."

The other three City Books published in 2013 were _The Lamorinda Book, The Berkeley/Oakland Book,_ and _The Livermore/Pleasanton Book._ Commenting on the _The Lamorinda Book,_ another in the series, Rick Kattenburg, Vice President of the Orinda Chamber of Commerce, states, "There’s great information on each town, with very well composed write-ups. The restaurant reviews are excellent, and the graphics are superb: It’s one of the best books of this kind I've seen."
