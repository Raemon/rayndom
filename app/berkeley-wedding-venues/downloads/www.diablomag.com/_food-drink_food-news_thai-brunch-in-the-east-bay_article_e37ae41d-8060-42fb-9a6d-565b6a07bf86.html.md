The Peach brings a pan-Asian perspective to breakfast.

Even in the Bay Area food world, the Thai breakfast trend is a dizzying one. In the span of just a couple of years, no fewer than five new restaurants launched in the East Bay specializing at least in part on breakfast dishes with a Southeast Asian bent. Wendy Torsap Sanchez of Walnut Creek’s Torsap Thai Kitchen says the unusual marriage is a natural one in the Bay Area, where diners combine an enduring love for breakfast with an adventurous culinary curiosity. Torsap Sanchez began hosting weekend brunch years ago, with the aim of blending “the comfort of traditional American breakfast dishes with the bold, aromatic flavors that are central to Thai cuisine.”

“It’s about taking something beloved and giving it a fresh, flavorful twist that both surprises and satisfies,” she adds.

Instead of standard steak and eggs, Torsap offers a Northeast Thai–style rib eye seasoned with tamarind and Thai herbs. Hat Yai Southern Thai–style fried chicken is served atop waffles with coconut chili syrup, while a tropical pandan sauce is drizzled over fluffy American-style pancakes instead of maple syrup.

Couple Jezreel “Jae” Rojas and Krissana “Tanz” Tussanaprasit encountered a problem when they wanted to open a fine-dining take on the Northern Thai flavors of Tussanaprasit’s native Chiang Mai: The Berkeley neighborhood they landed in lacked vibrant nightlife. And so they pivoted to breakfast. Since last spring, Tanzie’s has been serving up a.m. dishes like soft pork belly with fried rice topped by a fried egg. Perhaps Tanzie’s most striking dish is the lava eggs: a mound of rice enveloped by a swirling, soft-cooked omelet served with proteins such as grilled pork jowl and aromatic, homemade Sai Oua sausage. Conspicuously absent on the menu: American brunch staples such as pancakes, bacon, and potatoes.

“We wondered whether people would be open to eating rice for breakfast,” admits Rojas, adding, “We were pleasantly surprised and delighted by the neighborhood’s warm welcome and strong support.”

Tanzie’s adds a Southeast Asian spin to morning favorites.

The response was so positive, in fact, that Tanzie’s recently launched a dinner menu offering straight Northern Thai specialties. But brunch service will remain, and the East Bay food world has taken notice. The last year saw the launch of Peak and Maya Thai Laos Cafe in Alameda, the Hangout in Walnut Creek, the Royale in Pleasant Hill, and the Peach in Oakland, all of which specialize in breakfast and brunch with varying degrees of Thai influence. While the latter has a more pan-Asian fusion approach, the Peach chef Juan Stevenson says that Southeast Asian flavors and techniques—as seen in, for example, red coconut curry in a curry shrimp and congee and a papaya salad slaw in a buttermilk fried chicken sandwich—are great to fill “flavor profile gaps” in the typical American breakfast.

As Torsap Sanchez points out, the trend “speaks to the growing demand for something fresh and exciting.”

“People want more than just the traditional bacon and eggs,” she says.
