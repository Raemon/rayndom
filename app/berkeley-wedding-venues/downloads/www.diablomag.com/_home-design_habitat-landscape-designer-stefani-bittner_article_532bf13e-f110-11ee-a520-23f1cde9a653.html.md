Stefani Bittner planted fragrant and edible flower beds in a Healdsburg project.

Copyright © 2024. Photographs by David Fenton. Published by Ten Speed Press.

Landscape designer Stefani Bittner’s third book, _The Fragrant Flower Garden: Growing, Arranging and Preserving Natural Scents,_ might seem like a departure for the author, who is known for her culinary-centric endeavors. However, her philosophy emphasizes “multipurpose gardens that are gorgeous extensions of your living space; that support our environment, being low-water and pollinator-attracting; and that can be harvested, for the kitchen and the vase.”

Edible and fragrant flowers go hand in hand. “When you grow an organic garden with food production, flowers have to be a big part of it,” she explains. “The purpose of a fragrant flower is to attract pollinators. In an organic garden especially, you need pollinators to help you be more productive. What smells good to the pollinators typically smells good to us as well.”

The proprietor of Homestead Design Collective considers her new book “a love letter to these plants that I include in my gardens.” About 70 percent of her clients are in the East Bay, where Bittner resides and treats her own two-acre property in Lafayette like a test lab of sorts. She is currently redesigning the grounds, in part to reduce water consumption; she also aims to educate others on the subject. “When people hear ‘low water,’ they think they’re going to have a cactus garden,” she says. “Low-water gardens can be super beautiful and bountiful.”

Bittner began her professional life in the nonprofit world. In the wake of her father’s cancer diagnosis, she “started deep-diving into growing organic food for him,” she recalls. In 2006, she took her first landscape design course at Oakland’s Merritt College. Bittner later taught classes herself at Aerin Moore’s Magic Gardens Landscaping, which led to an editor at Emeryville-based Ten Speed Press reaching out. _The Beautiful Edible Garden: Design a Stylish Outdoor Space Using Vegetables, Fruits, and Herbs,_ coauthored with Leslie Bennett, was released in 2013, followed four years later by _Harvest: Unexpected Projects Using 47 Extraordinary Garden Plants,_ written with Alethea Harampolis.

_The Fragrant Flower Garden,_ another collaboration with Harampolis, features garden design ideas, descriptions of dozens of plants, floral arrangement tips, and instructions for aromatic projects. According to Bittner—whose go-to for plants is Morningsun Herb Farm in Vacaville (look for them at the Walnut Creek farmers market)—a tea garden is essential. Among her favorite tea plants are anise hyssop, scented geranium, berggarten sage, and lemon verbena. For clients, she often makes a bouquet of tea plants to be enjoyed in a vase for several days. Once the bottoms are trimmed, they are bound with twine, dried, and used for a pot of tea. “It’s opening up people’s minds that your garden can include plants that give back to you in all kinds of ways,” she says.
