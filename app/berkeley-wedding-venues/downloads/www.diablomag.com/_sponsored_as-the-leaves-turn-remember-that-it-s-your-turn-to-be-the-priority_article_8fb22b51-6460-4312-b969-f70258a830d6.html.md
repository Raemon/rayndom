![no ribbon_SRM-ALLO-Breast Cancer Awareness 2025-IMG-DIG-AD-960 x 640-2025 \(1\).jpg](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAQAAAADCAQAAAAe/WZNAAAAEElEQVR42mM8U88ABowYDABAxQPltt5zqAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)

Amid the hustle and bustle of today and the holiday planning that seems to come earlier each year, prioritize time to put your own well-being on the calendar. Making time for screenings now can help you stay healthy and active for all the busy months ahead—and for the people who count on you.

One of the simplest, most powerful things you can do for yourself is keep up with annual mammograms. Regular screenings can detect breast cancer up to three years before symptoms appear—giving you more options and better outcomes if something is found. At San Ramon Regional Medical Center, we provide advanced **3D mammogram technology** for greater accuracy and early detection. These scans allow our radiologists to view breast tissue in thin layers, which reduces false positives and makes the entire experience more precise—and more comfortable—than traditional mammograms. One short appointment now can bring enormous peace of mind and help you keep showing up for the people you love.

Strong bones are another key to staying active and independent, especially as the weather cools and holiday activities ramp up. That’s why we also offer **DEXA scanning technology,** the gold standard for measuring bone density and providing insights into osteoporosis risk, fracture prevention, and body composition. A DEXA (dual X-ray absorptiometry) scan is a specialized X-ray of the hip and spine that tells your doctor whether your bones are getting weaker or if you’re developing osteoporosis. Screening is recommended for women age 65 and older, and for women 50–64 who have increased risk factors.

Bone health is often forgotten and it’s important to check these risk factors while it’s a choice and not because you have to.

Plus, it's easier and more accurate than ever: At San Ramon Regional, we use the Horizon DXA System—**the latest generation of bone densitometry.** Its high-resolution ceramic detector array and high-frequency X-ray generator, combined with OnePass fan-beam acquisition geometry, deliver rapid, dual-energy bone density measurements in a single sweep. This eliminates beam overlap errors and image distortion that can occur with older methods. Plus, the Horizon’s Dynamic Calibration System offers pixel-by-pixel calibration through bone and tissue equivalents for even greater precision. All of this advanced technology means more accurate results and more confident guidance from your physician.

Not sure if you should have screenings? [You can take can this two-minute quiz to identify your risk for Breast Cancer](https://www.sanramonmedctr.com/health-assessments/breast-cancer-quiz) and you can [learn more about why bone density matters to you here](https://www.sanramonmedctr.com/healthy-living/corporate-content/nine-factors-that-shape-bone-density).

Make time today to put yourself first: schedule your annual mammogram and ask your doctor whether it’s time for a DEXA scan. At San Ramon Regional Medical Center, we’re not just providing screenings—we’re your partners in women’s health, here with experience, compassion, and state-of-the-art technology to help you enjoy a full, vibrant life.
