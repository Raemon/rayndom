**_Diablo_ marks 31 years of Threads of Hope in 2025,** honoring local volunteers and philanthropic changemakers. The annual celebration, now held in partnership with the East Bay Leadership Council, has recognized hundreds of compassionate community heroes over the past three decades, and this year’s group is equally noteworthy.

In these pages, you’ll meet a Walnut Creek woman who has volunteered at multiple area nonprofits, comforting hospice patients with the aid of her two cats and advocating for dignified and safe senior care, among other efforts. Family is a motivation for multiple honorees, such as a Lafayette man who spends hours uplifting adults with special needs, including his own son, and a former special education teacher who turned personal tragedy into opioid overdose education and prevention. Then there is an Alameda resident who continues to lend his time and construction skills to Habitat for Humanity East Bay/Silicon Valley at age 75. This year’s philanthropist awardee has generously supported multiple regional arts organizations and their education initiatives.

_Diablo,_ the East Bay Leadership Council, and event sponsors are thrilled to laud these endeavors, and all volunteers, at the Threads of Hope Awards ceremony on December 4 at the Lesher Center for the Arts in Walnut Creek.

# Mark Mahaney 

**Las Trampas | Lafayette**

Although Mark Mahaney has volunteered for much of his life, dating back to working in a Washington, D.C. soup kitchen in his 20s, his time spent at Las Trampas has a personal connection. The Lafayette-based organization supports adults with special needs, including Mahaney’s son Noah, who has autism and Down syndrome.

“Las Trampas is just a gift,” Mahaney says. “It’s a gift to the participants, it’s a gift to the families, and it’s a gift to the community.”

Noah has attended the licensed day program at Las Trampas since he was 22, arriving each morning wearing his NASA backpack and eager to join friends for outings and skills training. Every Friday, Mahaney and his wife, Tammy—who share 10 children, ages 15 to 25—lead a “happy hour” of music and dance where attendees do the Hokey Pokey, groove to “Y.M.C.A.,” and listen to tunes from Taylor Swift and the Beatles. “It’s fun,” says Mahaney. “It’s a nice way for everyone to end their day, and we try to get everybody engaged. We love doing it; it really is our happy hour.” Small moments, like coaxing a smile from a nonverbal individual or prompting someone’s dance moves, add to the enjoyment. 

Mahaney, a financial analyst, is also the board president at Las Trampas. In recent years, the program has expanded from 60 to 90 or so participants while improving wages for its hardworking staff. For Mahaney, supporting the caregivers is just as vital as helping those served by Las Trampas. “These aren’t easy jobs,” he says. “And I think ... people who work there are fantastic.”

Adds Las Trampas executive director Dan Hogue, “He embraced the [board president] role with characteristic humility and heart. … Mark helps create a space where individuals of all abilities are seen, celebrated, and given the opportunity to thrive. His willingness to be hands-on, show up week after week, and connect on a human level with our participants speaks volumes about his compassion and belief in an inclusive community.”

Service is a family affair for the Mahaneys. The pair also volunteers at Shelter, Inc., an organization assisting low-income and homeless families; they even bring their kids to help cook meals and spend time with the residents. Additionally, they travel on medical missions to countries such as Madagascar, Senegal, and Ecuador. Tammy, a doctor of nurse practice, provides care while her husband handles eye charts, brings coffee to the physicians, and utilizes his language skills.

Whether serving locally or globally, Mahaney sees volunteering as a simple act of love for one’s neighbors. “Helping others makes our whole community better,” he says. —Rachel Orvino

# Kelly Perkins 

**Carson’s Wings of Hope | Clayton**

Less than a week after Kelly Perkins tragically lost her 21-year-old son, Carson, to a drug overdose in 2022, she resolved to help other families avoid the same agonizing experience.

Carson began abusing drugs following a football-related head trauma and resulting depression and anxiety when he was a student at Northgate High School in Walnut Creek. He went through rehab postgraduation and moved to Texas, but backslid on a visit home after his grandmother went into the hospital. Carson took fentanyl-laced Xanax he found in his old bedroom before his mother discovered her blue-lipped son and called 9-1-1. Despite the paramedics’ efforts, Carson died, just two hours before his grandma also passed away. 

“At that time, I didn’t know about Narcan [a medication nasal spray used to treat opioid overdose] or fentanyl,” recalls Perkins. “I thought about how many other families don’t know about them and are in danger of losing a kid.” 

She channeled her grief into Carson’s Wings of Hope, a drug awareness effort named after a Costa Rican butterfly Perkins witnessed on a trip shortly after losing her son. “[On a hike], this butterfly followed me … and I said, ‘It’s Carson, being there with me.’ Let’s bring hope to kids who are suffering like my son did,” she adds.

In addition to holding educational presentations for thousands of students in the Mt. Diablo Unified School District (MDUSD)—where Perkins was a special education teacher for 27 years—Carson’s Wings of Hope also distributes Narcan at local parks, businesses, and community events. The nonprofit group includes several of Carson’s friends; two young members even helped save a life at Outside Lands music festival last year by recognizing the signs of an opioid overdose and administering the Narcan that they had on hand. “When they told me, I was just bawling,” says Perkins. To date, Carson’s Wings of Hope has given out more than 1,000 kits with Narcan, gloves, and mouth shields. 

“Through tireless outreach, direct harm- reduction efforts, and emotional support for grieving families, Kelly strengthens the very fabric of the East Bay—one life, one conversation, and one act of healing at a time,” says Shannon Cherry, a fellow volunteer. 

Perkins recently stepped back from teaching and is developing a new wellness ambassador program that involves recruiting student leaders to provide peer support on Contra Costa County middle and high school campuses.

“They might be the first point of contact for students who are experiencing trauma, anxiety, depression, or substance abuse,” says Perkins. She is currently working on grant funding and hopes to debut a pilot program at a couple of MDUSD schools in early 2026.

Helping her community remains at the center of everything Perkins does. “It takes the piece of my heart that’s grieving and puts it into a focus of strength and goodness,” she says. “I can’t bring my son back, but I can hopefully prevent other people from this pain, this loss. That’s my path. It’s what I am meant to do.” —R.O.

# Ted Owyang 

**Habitat for Humanity East Bay/Silicon Valley | Oakland**

Ted Owyang grew up in Oakland, where he was laboring for his father’s general contractor business by age 12. 

“When I drive around Oakland, I can point out buildings that I helped work on from the ground up,” says Owyang. “It’s nice to see so many of them still standing.”

Owyang ultimately applied those skills toward his own professional development, working for nearly 30 years as a union plumber and then as a building inspector in Burlingame and Fremont. After spending his career dealing with electrical systems, plumbing, and air conditioning—essentially everything happening within the walls of a building—Owyang turned that mechanical know-how to Habitat for Humanity efforts in the area.

One of the first projects Owyang worked on for the local chapter of the nonprofit dedicated to safe, affordable housing was a playhouse that had been designed by a prizewinning architect.

“It was a six-sided playhouse and a very imaginative design, but it had to be put together in a very short period of time,” says Owyang. “I had the contracting skill set, and the team had such a good time doing the work. We call it the Heart House—the door is heart-shaped, and inside there is a little library.”

After Owyang and other volunteers initially build a playhouse, they prepare the components of many duplicates based on the original model. These kits are sold to groups to construct as team-building projects, then the completed playhouses are often donated to military families and nonprofits.

“Ted has directly contributed to the construction of hundreds of playhouses,” says Gus Cancro, a program manager for Habitat for Humanity East Bay/Silicon Valley. “He has played a key role in improving safety efficiency in our playhouse workshops, including leading critical electrical upgrades that saved our organization thousands of dollars. He has also lent his time and talent ... [to help] with essential repairs, improvements, and installations that keep our spaces functional and safe.”

Owyang is touched to be recognized as a Threads of Hope recipient but is quick to praise his fellow volunteers for their efforts. (“I would have nominated Giulia Hill, who works tirelessly hauling giant sheets of plywood to worksites despite the fact that she weighs maybe 100 pounds,” he says.)

Meanwhile, Owyang loves applying his skills in Habitat for Humanity’s carpentry shop, making cabinets and furniture that the nonprofit can use in its various projects in the East Bay.

“It’s [essentially] an adult day-care center that keeps me out of trouble,” Owyang says with a chuckle. —Peter Crooks

# Karen Douglas 

**Choice in Aging | Pleasant Hill**

If we all just do a little, it means a lot,” says Karen Douglas, who does far more than a little in support of the community. In fact, the Walnut Creek resident estimates she spends upward of 20 hours a week volunteering for such organizations as Choice in Aging, Hospice East Bay, Make-A-Wish Greater Bay Area, and Assistance League Diablo Valley.

Douglas’s commitment to service began early. Growing up in Wisconsin, she was raised by parents who modeled the value of giving back. Volunteering has remained a constant thread throughout her life, and today she devotes her time to causes that speak to her deeply.

Her work with Make-A-Wish carries an especially personal connection. Her son, Parker, was diagnosed with a chronic liver condition when he was an infant, and by the time he was 16, he needed a liver transplant. His doctor recommended him for Make-A-Wish, and as a result, the family flew to Wisconsin to meet National Football League quarterback Aaron Rodgers and attend a Green Bay Packers game. Parker, now 27, is healthy thanks to his father being a living donor, and Douglas serves on one of Make-A-Wish’s advisory councils—promoting awareness of the organization and correcting misconceptions about its recipients (most people assume giftees are terminal). “Eighty percent of Wish kids live to adulthood,” she says. “For Parker, it was the boost he needed.”

Douglas is equally passionate about Hospice East Bay, where she has been a patient support volunteer for nearly two decades. She’s even brought her cats, Dexter and Mendelssohn, to comfort patients, though both animals have since retired from duty. “The cats brought so much joy,” she recalls. She still sees hospice patients on her own and tears up while talking about one woman who wanted to wear her prettiest pajamas for her recent visit with Douglas.

Her most long-standing commitment has been to Assistance League Diablo Valley, where she has volunteered for 23 years. She helps out at the Lafayette thrift shop and has served on a variety of committees. Douglas is a tireless advocate for Choice in Aging and sits on the board of the Pleasant Hill nonprofit that provides services for older adults. 

“Karen has quickly become our go-to person on the board. She presents on our behalf at various community events, speaker forums, and organizations, spreading our mission and offering visibility. She can be counted on to step up and embrace any challenge,” says Choice in Aging president and chief executive officer Debbie Toth. “Our community is a better place because of Karen!”

For Douglas, the hours she devotes aren’t about recognition. She is thoroughly engaged in helping the community and hopes that she will inspire others to volunteer. “I’m not doing it so I can feel good,” she says. “I’m doing it so other people can feel good and feel supported.” —R.O.

# James Bell 

**Oakland Symphony | Oakland**

#### \- 2024 PHILANTHROPY AWARD RECIPIENT -

While working on high school homework assignments, James Bell regularly listened to symphonic music. “It just speaks to me. When I was younger, it made me think the world’s a lot bigger than the one I know,” he says. “And I wanted to get to know that bigger world.”

In the years since, music and the arts have certainly broadened the world for Bell—and inspired him to expand access to cultural inspiration for others. When he moved his company, Bell Investment Advisors—which he cofounded in 1991 with his late wife, Bonnie Bonetti-Bell—to Oakland from San Francisco, he looked for ways to become involved in his new community. The Oakland Symphony seemed a logical place to start, particularly since he had been a subscriber since the 1980s. With Bell Investment Advisors, he shifted to a concert sponsor and eventually sponsored the symphony’s 2025–2026 season; he has also served as chair of the board. In total, Bell has donated approximately $2.5 million to the group—and is particularly passionate about the symphony’s youth education programs.

“The challenges of young people today are much greater than the ones I faced,” says Bell, who lives on the border between Oakland and Berkeley. “You really get to observe and know these kids and see the sparkle in their eyes. We show them ways to love the world and the human experience.”

Bell has also donated hundreds of thousands of dollars—and countless hours on boards and as a volunteer—to choral programs for young people at the Piedmont East Bay Children’s Choir (PEBCC); writing initiatives at the New Literary Project; and myriad other efforts at Festival Opera, Quest Science Center, Livermore Valley Arts, the Ann Martin Center, and more East Bay groups. After the passing of his wife (who shared many of his artistic passions), Bell established a fund named in her honor at the PEBCC for free choral music lessons at Title I schools, as well as resources for UC Berkeley and St. Mary’s College students to lead free workshops in creative writing for underserved high schoolers. Additionally, he’s acted as a global ambassador of sorts, traveling with the Oakland Symphony Youth Orchestra to Cuba, hosting singers from Lithuania, and visiting Japan on behalf of Rotary Club of Oakland #3. 

“[Philanthropy is] about love and humankind. James is an exemplar of that,” says New Literary Project chair Joseph Di Prisco. “Some philanthropists write a check, and there are some that donate their time. James steps up everywhere. He’s very active. He has lots of ideas. … Boards and the community in general say, ‘This guy’s for real.’”

For those looking to give back to their own communities, Bell recommends looking at what they love. “What is it about humanity that really makes their heart beat faster, gives them the experience of being fully alive?” he says. “If that’s not part of what you start doing, it’s not going to be sustainable. It’s generosity and gratitude for whatever experiences that you have.” —Emilie White
