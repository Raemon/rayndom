Creative cocktails complement Tropa’s modern takes on Filipino comfort food.

Maybe you _can_ go home again. Restaurateur JB Balingit spins many plates with his diverse collection of restaurants spread across Contra Costa County. There’s the Library, his wine bar and social club in downtown Walnut Creek; Vic’s, a longtime popular brunch destination in Martinez that he’s now converting into a beer and cocktail garden concept; and the Hideout Kitchen, his flagship new American comfort food restaurant that he transplanted to a prominent new location in downtown Lafayette early last year. While the expansive move was clearly necessary, it was hard not to miss the Hideout’s original setting tucked off Lafayette’s Mt. Diablo Boulevard. After all, the chef made his name by serving up unapologetically bold, fun fare and cocktails in that charming, homey interior that opens seamlessly into a lovely tree-lined patio. 

![DM2510_024_DIG.jpg](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAQAAAADCAQAAAAe/WZNAAAAEElEQVR42mM8U88ABowYDABAxQPltt5zqAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)

Tropa’s cozy interior features keepsakes from the Philippines. 

Cat Fennell Photography

Balingit, it seems, felt the same way and held onto the space. This summer, he surprised local diners by introducing Tropa in that location. The eatery is a deeply personal project in which he bridges his modern dining sensibilities with the comforting Filipino fare he loved growing up in Manila.

“Coming back to our original location felt like a proper homecoming, not just for me as a chef, but for all my team members that have been with us since day one. And it felt like a great homecoming to explore my culinary roots and heritage,” he told _Diablo._ “Then it took me 15 months to kind of wrap my head around expressing my culture in a restaurant space—being open to criticism, but at the same time, being excited to share it with people.”

Balingit even took two culinary research trips back to the Philippines to “re-root” and to make sure he was doing justice to the dishes he wanted to re-create through his own culinary lens. It helps that Filipino food is fairly accessible with a broad range of offerings—garlic shrimp, fried rice, chicken lumpia, mango salad, barbecue street skewers—reflecting Manila’s history as an international port city. Throw in the country’s enduring love of all things pork, and you’ve got an egalitarian cuisine that should satisfy most palates.

Adobo sticky ribs are a menu standout.

Ethan Fletcher

Dishes are designed to be shared family-style, and the _kilawin_ is a good place to start. This Filipino take on ceviche offers ample cuts of firm citrus-marinated white fish, and Balingit mixes in a touch of coconut milk to lend a tropical sweetness that balances the acidity of the citrus and heat from sliced labuyo chilies. You can scoop it up with the delicious side of paper-thin fried plantain chips. Even better were the sticky ribs. A sextet of ribs—stacked like Lincoln logs atop a banana leaf—are slathered with an addictive adobo glaze that perfectly mixes tart vinegar with sugar, spice, and fish sauce umami. The ribs toppled like a felled Jenga tower in short order, and there was no meat left on those bones. Less successful was the _lechon kawali,_ the most straightforward and least interesting of the dishes we tried. Far be it for me to complain about crispy fried pork belly, but the generous portion of 10 or so slices was dry and underseasoned, which a duo of peppered gravy and spicy vinegar dipping sauces couldn’t hide. Fortunately, the elegantly comforting oxtail _kare-kare_ was just the opposite. Flavorful oxtail is braised to fall-apart tenderness and bathed in a rich sauce combining beef broth, crushed peanuts, and shrimp paste along with eggplant, long beans, and bok choy. We eagerly ladled the satisfying stew over a shared side of steamed rice.

Ceviche-style _kilawin_ pairs marinated fish with sweet, tart, and spicy flavors.

Food isn’t the only passport into the sentimental land of Balingit’s youth. Nicely prepared cocktails are named after notable sayings, places, and personalities of the Philippines, with each menu listing followed by an explanatory paragraph. The FPJ, for example, nods to famed Filipino action star Fernando Poe Jr. via a twist on the margarita featuring turmeric spirits and a tamarind rim. Balingit also came back from each trip to the Philippines with memorabilia—vintage photos, tchotchkes, newspaper clippings, stamps, string lights—that form the bulk of the restaurant’s decor and contribute to the endearing atmosphere.

“I was trying to replicate that feeling, to create a sense of nostalgia by being in that space,” he says. “The greatest compliment I’ve gotten so far is that ‘this [felt] like my ancestral home when I walked in.’ For me, that was a huge design win.”

The trick, of course, is to make Tropa accessible to Filipinos and non-Filipinos alike. And during my visit on a warm summer evening, the diverse crowd appeared to be enjoying the restaurant’s intimate, indoor-outdoor setting just off Lafayette’s main drag. If you can, go on a Friday or Saturday night when Tropa stays open late and hosts a live DJ, spinning excellent retro soul tunes on our visit. The food, the vibe, and the music all combine to make it feel as if you’ve stumbled onto a private home dinner party hosted by Balingit—and everyone is invited. _[tropaeats.com](http://tropaeats.com)._
