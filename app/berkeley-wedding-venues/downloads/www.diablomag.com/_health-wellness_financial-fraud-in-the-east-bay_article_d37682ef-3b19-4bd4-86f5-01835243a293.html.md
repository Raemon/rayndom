Sam Kalda

Sam Kless was grateful he wasn’t on tour when he was hit with a health-care scam. The bass player for the Berkeley band Mom Jeans ended up spending hours unraveling the web of charges he had incurred after what seemed like a friendly customer service call late last year.

He’d placed the call to simply renew his Covered California plan, but when the agent offered him a better version of the Kaiser Permanente coverage he’d had for years, Kless happily provided his credit card details.

It was only when he got a bill from Kaiser for over $1,000 that Kless realized something was up.

“I was like, _that’s crazy! I can’t afford that. Who could?_ ” he says.

Once alerted, Kless discovered more charges he hadn’t noticed. He’d been paying hundreds of dollars on his credit card every month to a company whose name he didn’t recognize. At the same time, his subsidized coverage through Covered California had lapsed, triggering Kaiser to charge him more for the same services he had been receiving all along. In total, he was out more than $2,000.

When he tried the number he’d originally called, it was disconnected. He realized then that he had been taken.

Smooth-talking salespeople posing as agents for familiar companies is just one of the growing scams victimizing more and more Americans. How did Kless end up on the phone with a fake Covered California agent? He can’t remember if he stumbled across the number on Google or if it came into his email. Both are techniques used by fraudsters to con people into calling the wrong number.

Sadly, scammers have separated many East Bay residents from even higher amounts of money than what was stolen from Kless. Some recent examples include:

**»** A Livermore man lost his life savings when a scam caller got him to liquidate his 401(k) to purchase gold bars, which he then handed over to a courier. The caller had convinced him that his social security number had turned up in a child pornography investigation and that he needed to purchase the gold to protect his assets.

**»** A San Leandro man was tricked by a pop-up window into giving fraudsters remote access to his computer, resulting in $44,000 worth of fake transactions.

**»** At least twice, residents of the Rossmoor active adult community in Walnut Creek have been targeted by what’s known as the “grandparent scam,” where a caller posing as a grandchild convinces an older person that they need money. One victim was instructed to put the cash in a machine at a local grocery store to buy cryptocurrency, while another had the cash picked up by a courier.

* * *

## DECEPTIVE PRACTICES

Greg Vogel, president of Walnut Creek’s GKV Capital management, says many clients have reported similar scam attempts.

“There seems to be more and more fraud where the criminals are posing as government employees and making demands, [saying] that you owe money, with a threatening element to it,” Vogel says. When clients report these frightening emails, texts, or calls, Vogel tells them not to respond. “The government doesn’t work that way. You get a letter in the mail.”

GKV has also been the target of attempts on clients’ money, but the office managed to spot the scams in time to stop them.

“A client had their Gmail account hacked,” says Vogel. “Once [the scammers] were in the client’s email account, they sent us an email saying, ‘Send $30,000 to this bank account for our remodel.’”

While it’s not unusual for clients to request that Vogel’s office wire cash, his staff made sure to reach out to the client for confirmation.

“They said, ‘I don’t know anything about that,’” Vogel recalls.

Beyond the East Bay, financial fraud has become a national epidemic, one that is hitting senior citizens the hardest.

Consumers in the United States reported losing $12.5 billion to fraud in 2024, 25 percent more than in 2023, according to the Federal Trade Commission. And new technologies, such as artificial-intelligence-powered voice cloning or “deep fake” audio, make scams harder to detect. The FTC has warned that fraudsters are using voice cloning to make the “grandparent scam” in particular more convincing. At the same time, technologies such as cryptocurrency “ATMs” in stores, as well as familiar tech like online banking, are making it easier for scammers to relocate money from victims’ accounts or to get the victims to move it themselves.

* * *

## HOW TO STAY SAFE FROM SCAMS

With new and old types of fraud coming in from all contact points, consumers need to be vigilant. Some of the best practices to protect yourself include:

**»** Be skeptical of any threatening- or urgent-sounding messages. Scammers try to pressure their victims to act quickly and not tell friends, family, or even bank employees what’s going on. Slow down, take a breath, and consult loved ones or trusted professionals before taking any action.

**»** Do not accept incoming phone calls regarding your money. Even if the call seems like it’s legitimately coming from your bank or law enforcement, hang up and contact that institution directly. Never share any personal information or codes to someone who calls you.

**»** Beware of any requests to pay with scammers’ favorite methods: cryptocurrency, wire transfer services, gift cards, or online payment apps.

Talk with the older adults in your life about these scams. If you worry your loved ones could be vulnerable, consider locking down accounts with no online access or hiring a financial manager to handle their banking and investments.

As for Kless, following hours of phone calls, he was able to get most of his money back.

Kaiser credited him for the extra he’d been billed during the months when his Covered California subsidy had lapsed, and Wells Fargo credited him for all the fraudulent payments he’d made. Covered California helped him get his original plan renewed.

“Luckily, I do all of my banking through my credit card,” says Kless, acknowledging the reality that it’s easier to get reimbursed for fraudulent credit card charges than for bank account debits.

Covered California media relations manager Jagdip Dhillon urges users to go directly to their website, [coveredca.com](http://coveredca.com), to get contact information or other details. Legitimate emails from the organization will always come from a @covered.ca.gov address, he says.

Going forward, Kless plans to always heed this advice. “I’m way more careful about using Google and making sure that the phone number I’m calling is the right one,” he says.

The musician, who relies on Covered California and Kaiser for treatment for his post-traumatic stress disorder, feels grateful to have narrowly avoided personal disaster.

“Literally my worst fear ever was losing my health care,” Kless says.
