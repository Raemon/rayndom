# Writers' Guidelines

### About _Diablo_ magazine

 _Diablo_ magazine is a general interest lifestyle magazine with a monthly circulation of 43,500, distributed to single-family homes in the San Francisco East Bay--from the Oakland/Berkeley hills to Orinda, Walnut Creek, Concord, Danville, Blackhawk, and the Tri-Valley. Features address local trends and issues, and provide service information to readers. Personality profiles spotlight people living in the area, or who have direct ties to the community. Regular departments include Speak of the Devil, our front-of-the-book section; One Fine Weekend, our travel section; and Last Word, our Q&A interview. Speak of the Devil contributions range from 75 words to about 300 words. Features can extend to more than 2,000 words. Diablo special issues include Health (January), Kids (March), Home (April), Women (May), Best of the East Bay (July), Food (November), and Volunteers (December).

### To send a query

Please read several issues of _Diablo_ before you suggest a story; we encourage you to visit past Issues on our website. Be as specific as possible in developing your idea, tailoring your story to a regular department or section. Please remember that the subject should be local. We do not publish film reviews, fiction, or poetry. Due to the volume of mail we receive, we are unable to accept query calls or discuss the merits of your idea. Instead, send your idea in writing or via e-mail. Include a cover letter that briefly explains your proposal and samples of any relevant published writing you have done. Since we receive queries every day, we cannot answer immediately. Please include a self-addressed, stamped envelope if you would like us to return any materials you have sent and allow us several weeks to review your proposal. Mail queries to: Editor, Diablo magazine, 2520 Camino Diablo, Walnut Creek, CA 94597
