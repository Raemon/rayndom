**The East Bay has proven to be fertile ground for premier athletes, and these history-making competitors are continuing that tradition of excellence.**

### RETURN TO FORM

When figure skater Alysa Liu spoke with _Diablo_ for our 2019 Best of the East Bay cover story, the then-13-year-old Richmond resident had just earned a spot in the record books as the youngest female athlete to win a senior national title. Despite the accolades, “I don’t really think of myself as famous,” Liu said at the time. There’s no denying her fame these days, as the now-19-year-old recently won gold at the 2025 ISU World Figure Skating Championships three years after initially hanging up her skates. Liu retired in 2022, saying she was “satisfied” with her skating career and ready to move on. Luckily for fans, she returned to the sport and became the first American woman in 19 years to win a world skating championship with her victory in March. Liu still practices at the Oakland Ice Center, where she started training at age 5, and enjoys spending time with friends in the East Bay. She will join Team USA for November’s Skate America, part of figure skating’s Grand Prix Series, and hopes to compete in the 2026 Olympics in Milan.

### WORLD LEADER

Walnut Creek’s Amit Elor seized her place on the international stage last summer when she took home a gold medal at the Paris Olympics. She was 20 years old at the time, making her the youngest Team USA wrestler (male or female) to win Olympic gold. Elor began wrestling when she was only 4 after seeing one of her three brothers in action and started strength training at Forma Gym in Walnut Creek when she was 10; her Forma coach, David Miller, was in Paris to see her winning match. In her youth, Elor was often embarrassed to tell people she wrestled, but she certainly doesn’t hide her skills as an adult. She was honored by her hometown with a celebration in Civic Park in September and now is looking ahead to the 2028 Olympics.

### TWIN TALENTS

In 2023, Amen and Ausar Thompson became the first pair of brothers in modern NBA history to be in the top 10 of the same draft, and the San Leandro–raised basketball stars are still making headlines. The brothers recently expressed interest in representing Jamaica (their father’s home country) at the 2028 Olympics and earned praise from hoops icon LeBron James. Amen had a big 2024–2025 NBA season with the Houston Rockets, getting NBA All-Defensive First Team honors and helping (unsuccessfully) battle the Golden State Warriors in the first round of the playoffs. “I definitely think Amen can become one special, special talent,” said Warriors star Draymond Green on his podcast. Ausar plays for the Detroit Pistons, who also lost the first round. The brothers moved to Florida before high school but learned to dream big during their years in the East Bay.
