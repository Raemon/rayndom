### Mensho Joins the Walnut Creek Ramen Party

Acclaimed Japanese ramen chain [**Mensho**](https://mensho.com/about/) is opening a new restaurant in Walnut Creek. Signage is up announcing its arrival at 1512 North Main Street downtown, in the former home of the Essence. Meanwhile, the company’s corporate website lists a new location as coming soon to Walnut Creek in 2026. Specializing in “farm to bowl” ramen utilizing quality seasonal and unusual ingredients, Mensho was founded in 2005 by ramen master Tomoharu Shono. The first Bay Area Mensho opened in San Francisco’s Tenderloin in 2016, followed by additional locations in San Francisco, San Rafael, Union City, and most recently on Oakland’s Piedmont Avenue in 2023. That Oakland shop has drawn crowds and built a sterling reputation on the back of creative ramens such as spicy lamb miso cumin and duck matcha, in addition to a robust lineup of vegan options.

This marks the second high-profile ramen restaurant to set its eyes on downtown Walnut Creek, after word broke earlier this year that Marufuku Ramen is planning a new location on Cypress Street (as well as another in Dublin). The San Francisco–based ramen outfit was planning a total revamp of the former Extreme Pizza space that would include a wood-forward, Japanese-themed interior, bamboo-lined back patio, and full bar with signature cocktail program. We’ve reached out for an update on that location, which was originally planned to open this summer. Meanwhile, between Mensho, Marufuku, and longtime popular standby Ramen Hiroshi, it looks like Walnut Creek will soon be awash in quality ramen.

### Pippal Debuts in Dublin

**[Pippal](https://www.pippaldublin.com),** an ambitious contemporary Indian restaurant with a pedigreed background, opened this week in Dublin. Taking over the former Coco Cabana space in the Shops at Waterford shopping center, it marks the newest addition to the dining lineup for the Rivaaz Hospitality group, which also runs modern Indian concepts Rooh, Fitoor, and Pippal Emeryville, and the Mediterranean-inspired Alora and Alora Social in San Ramon. Taking the lead in Dublin are restaurateurs and husband-wife team **Carolina** and **Jatin Bunty Grewal,** the latter of whom drew inspiration from his career as a model and Bollywood actor for Pippal’s regional Indian menu and cinematic, art-deco-inspired design. Along with Pippal Emeryville favorites like _litti chokha_ wheat flour dumplings, Goan crab curry, and chicken biryani, head chef Munish Rana is debuting several new dishes exclusive to Dublin. Those include a Parsi fish curry, steamed fish in mustard-flavored coconut and coriander gravy, chicken Chettinad curry with koftas simmered in gravy, and _ladhaki thupka,_ a noodle soup with vegetable broth from the Ladakh region of India. There is also a bar menu highlighted by semolina-fried pepper calamari with fresh coriander-garlic chutney and spicy deep-fried chicken wings tossed with curry leaf and spring onion. The in-house mixology team, meanwhile, launched a new lineup of cocktails inspired by iconic Indian landmarks, including a Taj Mahal with rum, lychee, ginger, green cardamon, and lemon, and a Kashipur Barracks with Old Monk 7-year rum, apple cider, warming spices, lemon, and honey.

### Rico Rico Taco Joins the Crowd at San Ramon’s City Center

Interesting new dining options continue to appear at City Center Bishop Ranch. The upscale San Ramon shopping center announced that Oakland’s [**Rico Rico Taco**](https://www.ricoricotaco.com) is bringing a new location to a ground floor space next to Fieldwork early next year. Slated to open in February, the fast-casual taqueria is known for its handmade tortillas, spit-roasted al pastor, and ingredient-driven tacos that include several vegetarian options (they opened an all-vegan spin-off in Oakland in 2023). At its Oakland location, Rico also offers burritos, burrito bowls, quesadillas, chiles rellenos, sopes, flautas, breakfast tacos, and aguas frescas. This comes after the recent debuts of [**Palmetto Superfoods**](https://www.palmettosuperfoods.com%20) and contemporary Indian concept **[Khaki Bar and Indian Canteen](https://www.wearekhaki.com),** as well as upcoming new Turkish restaurant **[Meyhouse](https://www.meyhouserestaurant.com),** which is eyeing an opening later this year. 

### Details at Last on Chez Panisse’s Bar Expansion

The _San Francisco Chronicle_ [uncovered](https://www.sfchronicle.com/food/restaurants/article/bar-panisse-berkeley-21083165.php) some details on [**Chez Panisse**](https://www.chezpanisse.com%20)’s long-planned expansion. Alice Waters’s famed Berkeley institution made the controversial decision to take over the space next door, which it owned but had long leased out to beloved tapas bar César, which, much to local diners’ dismay, exited in the summer of 2022. Since then, details have remained scarce—until now. Per public permit records obtained by the Chron, the location will be called **Bar Panisse** and according to a draft menu will likely serve smaller bar-friendly plates (house-made potato chips, duck liver mousse crostini); a couple of larger plates, including steak frites; and a dessert to complement its full liquor license. No update, however, on when Bar Panisse may actually open.
