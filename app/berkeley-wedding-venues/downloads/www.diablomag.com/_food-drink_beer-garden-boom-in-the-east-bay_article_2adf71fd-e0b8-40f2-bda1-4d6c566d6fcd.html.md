Looking for an easy, outdoor hang this summer for a beer and a bite with friends, kids, and dogs? You’re in luck: Local breweries have stepped up in a big way, doubling down on their East Bay footprint with expansive new beer-garden-style venues from Alameda to Livermore. 

The last year alone has seen the debut of Headlands Brewing’s 5,000-square-foot beer garden in Walnut Creek; Canyon Club Brewery’s 7,000-square-foot brewpub in the Danville Livery; Calicraft Brewing Co.’s expansion at its headquarters in Walnut Creek; and an Almanac taproom anchoring a 12,000-square-foot food hall in West Oakland.

It’s a trend that’s long overdue, says Canyon Club’s Kevin Hamilton, and one that fills a void for “third places,” multigenerational community gathering spots outside of home and work.

“I lived in Germany and would go to beer gardens where I’d see kids playing while their parents had a beer—everyone having a good time together,” he says. “America doesn’t do that well. You have bars and then Chuck E. Cheese, with very few things in between.”

The Lamorinda resident decided to re-create the German model in Moraga, where he debuted Canyon Club’s flagship brewery, beer garden, and restaurant in 2019. The spacious, outdoor-oriented venue was an instant hit—so much so that Canyon Club expanded to Danville earlier this spring, in large part by offering a flexible space for a wide audience to drink, eat, play, or just hang out.

Breweries are uniquely suited to the third place role, says Calicraft’s Blaine Landberg, who in addition to dramatically expanding his once-modest Shadelands taproom, added a second location in Fairfield and this summer aims to open another spot in Davis, in addition to a rooftop bar in downtown Walnut Creek.

“The great thing about breweries and beer gardens is they are casual spaces and an affordable luxury. You can come as you are in work clothes, workout clothes—no one cares,” he says. “When you think about beer, you think about backyard barbecues or going to a ball game. It’s a product for average, normal people, so it just makes sense that breweries would … create these gathering places.”

This wave of openings isn’t just for beer geeks, says Almanac’s Damian Fagan, whose flagship facility in Alameda packs in folks by catering “to every age and stripe of person you can fathom.”

“This isn’t the taproom scene of 5 or 10 years ago, with a bunch of white guys with beards talking about beer,” he says. “We don’t care if you know about hops or even drink beer. We have a zillion other options. There’s wine, kombucha, arcade games. If all you want to do is eat a cheeseburger, you’ll love Almanac.”

These days, taprooms are also just good business. When Austin Sharp joined Headlands in 2017, the brewery contracted production to outside facilities and was struggling to gain traction in the retail market. In 2021, the company launched an outdoor taproom on Mt. Diablo Boulevard in Lafayette, which was not only a big success but provided a center of gravity for a nomadic brand.

Headlands Brewing

“We received such amazing support from that community, and it gave a face to the brewery,” remembers Sharp, who has since launched Headlands outposts in Berkeley and Walnut Creek. “Really, it’s pretty logical: If you can have a great taproom with a great atmosphere, that will expand the number of people that potentially buy your product. We sell way more Headlands at Trader Joe’s and Whole Foods around Lafayette than other areas, and we’re seeing the same thing in Berkeley and Walnut Creek.”

Perhaps most important, says the Berkeley resident, is that the breweries have strong local ties. Headlands now makes its beer at the old E.J. Phair Brewing Company facility in Pittsburg. Sharp says he hopes to eventually reopen that location to the public, and the company is scouting the East Bay for other potential taprooms.

“There’s something nice about knowing that your beer was made locally and you might even meet the brewer while you’re there,” says Sharp. “It’s a natural extension.”

### What’s on Tap

Here’s what to expect at the East Bay’s newest beer gardens.

#### Almanac, Oakland

**Space:** Twenty taps of beer can be enjoyed at Almanac’s new West Oakland “clubhouse” within the recently opened Prescott Market food hall, or outside in a 300-seat courtyard beer garden complete with an Airstream bar and sandbox play area for kids.

**Food:** Pinwheel pizzas headline Almanac’s menu, which should expand over the summer. There are also a half dozen independent food vendors within the market itself.

**Beyond beer:** Wine, cider, and kid and adult slushies.

**Activities:** Sports watch parties. _[almanacbeer.com](http://almanacbeer.com)._

#### Calicraft Brewing Co., Walnut Creek

**Space:** The initial phase of a two-part expansion plan brings a 6,500-square-foot outdoor beer garden with a 40-foot shipping container bar, firepits, picnic areas, and outdoor televisions. The second phase, scheduled for completion next year, will add a 10,000-square-foot two-story building housing a brewery, winery, distillery, and restaurant.

**Food:** Light snacks and rotating food trucks, mostly Citizen Pizza with its thin-crust pies.

**Beyond beer:** Cider, wine, kid and adult slushies, and soon, Calicraft-made canned cocktails.

**Activities:** Televised sports, trivia nights each week, monthly running and yoga events, and summer and winter markets. _[calicraft.com](http://calicraft.com)._

#### Canyon Club Brewery, Danville

**Space:** A big horseshoe bar anchors the new Canyon Club location in a lofty interior within the Danville Livery. Folding windows open out to a beer garden with firepits, heat lamps, and a stage for live music.

**Food:** Upscale tavern fare includes pretzels, poutine, salads, wings, sandwiches, burgers, and entrées such as fish and chips and bratwurst.

**Beyond beer:** In addition to limited-edition rotating beers brewed on-site, there is wine, cider, and cocktails, plus hard seltzer and kombucha.

**Activities:** Periodic retail pop-ups and live music on Friday and Saturday evenings. _[canyonclub.works](http://canyonclub.works)._

#### Headlands Brewing, Walnut Creek

**Space:** A full 5,000 square feet of mostly outdoor beer garden featuring firepits, heat lamps, a kids’ play area, and even an adults-only section, all within walking distance of the Pleasant Hill BART station.

**Food:** Smashburgers headline the menu, along with salads, sandwiches, fries, and Bavarian pretzels.

**Beyond beer:** Cocktails, wine, and espresso drinks.

**Activities:** Outdoor TVs and weekend live music. _[headlandsbrewing.com](http://headlandsbrewing.com)._
