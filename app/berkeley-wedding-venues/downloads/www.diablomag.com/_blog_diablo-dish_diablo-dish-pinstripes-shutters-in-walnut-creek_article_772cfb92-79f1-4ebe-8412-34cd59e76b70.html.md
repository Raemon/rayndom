### Pinstripes Shutters Less Than a Year After Opening

Bowling, bocce, and bistro complex [**Pinstripes**](https://www.pinstripes.com) closed abruptly just 10 months after a splashy debut in Broadway Plaza. The national eat-ertainment chain offered sit-down Italian-inspired dining (including a weekend buffet brunch), downstairs and upstairs bars, eight bowling lanes, and two bocce courts in a high-profile two-story, 23,000-square-foot former Crate and Barrel location in the heart of Walnut Creek’s premier shopping center. While a message at the Walnut Creek branch said it was closed Monday and Tuesday “due to unforeseen circumstances,” Pinstripes representatives [have reportedly confirmed](https://www.kron4.com/news/bay-area/bowling-alley-restaurant-in-walnut-creek-abruptly-closes-months-after-opening/) that the Walnut Creek location has closed permanently due to the Chicago-based company filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. As part of those proceedings, Pinstripes was shutting several of its 18 restaurants, while securing a “committed buyer for our continuing locations.” One of those appears to be Pinstripes San Mateo, which looks to still be operating—Pinstripes’ website now lists a total of eight locations, including the one in San Mateo. The news comes three weeks after the hotly anticipated new Walnut Creek expansion of Original Joe’s shuttered due to a kitchen fire after a successful opening weekend in Broadway Plaza. Owners have yet to provide a reopening update. 

### Craft Beer Up, Craft Beer Down

Local craft brewing heavyweight [**21st Amendment Brewery**](https://21st-amendment.com) announced suddenly that it will be shutting down. The 25-year-old San Francisco–born operation, known for its fun flavors such as Hell or High Watermelon and its trailblazing move to canning over bottling, transferred to its sprawling new facility in San Leandro in 2015. Founders Nico Freccia and Shaun O’Sullivan announced that they will close down the San Leandro production operation and taproom, as well as its San Francisco taproom near Oracle Park, by early November. The move was reportedly prompted when 21st Amendment’s financial lender declined to keep funding the brewery, which had been losing money. The brewery’s struggles were attributed specifically to current economic uncertainty, while also reflecting the challenge of maximizing its large production capacity amid a nationwide trend of lowered beer consumption. It’s a trend that has hit the local craft beer scene hard in recent years, which has seen several high-profile craft brewery closures and consolidations. Freccia did tell [_SFGate_](https://www.sfgate.com/food/article/sf-brewery-oracle-park-shutting-down-21031443.php%20) that they are hoping to find a new owner to take over operations at 21st Amendment. 

Not all is gloom and doom, however, as the beer garden/taproom boom looks to be continuing. Berkeley-based [**Fieldwork Brewing Company**](https://fieldworkbrewing.com) carries on its steady expansion. A new planned taproom—its 10th, including ones in San Ramon, San Leandro, and Berkeley—will be the brewery’s first in San Francisco. According to the _San Francisco Chronicle,_ Fieldwork will be opening on the waterfront at 1 China Basin Park, where it will be part of the large Mission Rock development across from Oracle Park that will include 1,000 apartments, office and life-science space, and several high-profile food spots including Flour and Water pizzeria, acclaimed croissant king Arsicault Bakery, and a new Tuscan concept from the owners of Che Fico.

Over at UC Berkeley, [**Headlands on Campus**](https://www.headlandsbrewing.com/on-campus-berkeley) has officially replaced Bear’s Lair as the university’s only on-site pub. Headlands Brewing is a proven East Bay commodity that runs successful beer gardens in Berkeley, Lafayette, and Walnut Creek, which should give it a leg up in successfully filling the Lair’s newer modern location off Bancroft Way that has struggled in recent years with a rotating cast of operators. The brewery also hired a full-time community engagement officer to forge connections among Cal’s vast student, faculty, and alumni network to help turn its new taproom and beer garden into the kind of gathering spot that the Bear’s Lair was known as back in the day. “Our goal isn’t just to pour beer,” says Headlands CEO and Berkeley resident Austin Sharp. “It’s to create a place where students, faculty, alumni, and neighbors can connect—a place that feels like it truly belongs to the Berkeley community.” In addition to beer, the new pub serves cocktails and nonalcoholic drinks and has a full food menu with apps, salads, sandwiches, and veggie and smashburgers. There is also a new outdoor patio with TVs and plenty of Cal sports memorabilia sprinkled throughout. 

And in Alameda, [**Park Station**](https://parkstation.beer) brings a large family- and dog-friendly indoor-outdoor beer garden right on the city’s main drag of Park Street. On offer are a full 30 taps with craft beers and cider, occasional live music, and food from the team at Rockridge’s Southie. 

### Flour and Water Pizza Expands East

Speaking of **Flour and Water,** East Bay shoppers can now get their hands on frozen versions of the acclaimed SF-based Italian favorite pizzas at select grocery stores—and will be able to enjoy fresh-baked pies in-person early next year. Owners Thomas McNaughton and Ryan Pollnow’s new frozen pizza line, modeled after their award-winning Flour and Water spin-off in North Beach, are now being sold at Whole Foods Market in Berkeley and Oakland, as well Of All Places market on Solano Avenue in Berkeley. The 13-inch pizzas, available in margherita, pepperoni, and _cacio e pepe_ varieties, feature four-day, slow-fermented dough made with North American wheat that is par-baked in the North Beach pizzeria’s high-heat electric deck oven and immediately flash frozen to preserve structure and quality. Meanwhile, an East Bay outpost of Flour and Water is on pace to debut in Oakland early next year. McNaughton and Pollnow plan to serve their West Coast–style pizza, in addition to Sicilian-style square-crust pies, antipasti, salads, soft serve, and wine and beer, out of a street-level space of the new Lark Uptown apartment complex at 24th and Harrison streets.

### Vanessa’s Bistro Closing in Berkeley

**Vanessa’s Bistro,** a popular French Vietnamese restaurant that’s been in business for nearly 20 years on Solano Avenue, is closing. Co-owner Vi Nguyen, the younger half of the mother-daughter ownership duo, said that they would be shuttering the restaurant in December due to dwindling foot traffic and economic instability. Nguyen’s mother, Vanessa Dang, helped build Vanessa’s into a popular neighborhood favorite both through her creative small plates and unique style—she was [known for](https://www.diablomag.com/food-drink/food-news/vanessas-bistro/article_f61b14a1-9f05-520c-9d9d-6cf1f2a7372e.html) working the kitchen in fashionable dress and high heels. Vanessa’s Bistro 2, which Dang opened in downtown Walnut Creek with her sons in 2009, will remain open.

### Wine Talk at Berkeley’s Donkey and Goat

Berkeley’s acclaimed **Donkey and Goat** winery is launching **[Unfiltered: Conversations About Wine](https://www.donkeyandgoat.com/upcoming-events/?srsltid=AfmBOooA35GmRQZUPW8taaydQEW-MgptvMf1uBc1UwKSVp6qMZ4xXwhp),** a monthly series spotlighting “winemakers who are pushing boundaries in their own unique ways.” This Thursday, the west Berkeley urban winery will host **Matt Niess** of North American Press, who will discuss his work with native and hybrid vines and their potential to adapt to the challenges presented by climate change in California. The event runs from 5-8 p.m., and yes, there will be a wine tasting.

### Mägo Dinner Series Celebrates Latin American Heritage Month

### Small Bites From Around the East Bay

**Kyle Itani** is at it again. The hustling Oakland restauranteur is bringing back some poultry favorites from his original Uptown restaurant at Berkeley’s Epicurious Garden, where he opened Itani Sushi last year. The casual, order-at-the-counter [**Hopscotch Chicken**](https://www.hopscotchchicken.com) dishes out chicken in fried, rotisserie, tender, and wing form in addition to salads and sandwiches. 

Cult hit smashburger operation **Hyphy Burger** is [opening](https://www.sfchronicle.com/food/restaurants/article/hyphy-burger-oakland-21022363.php) a second location in East Oakland after the successful launch of its flagship West Oakland store earlier this year. 

**Edith’s Pie,** which offered terrific sweet and savory pies available late at night, is [closing](https://www.sfchronicle.com/food/restaurants/article/ediths-pie-oakland-21033126.php) in Uptown Oakland. 

Popular South Bay Middle Eastern chain **Dishdash** looks to be aiming for an [early 2026 debut](https://www.pleasantonweekly.com/food/2025/08/06/south-bay-restaurant-chain-dish-n-dash-expanding-to-dublin-in-old-applebees-spot/) in the former Applebee’s Grill and Bar location at Dublin’s Hacienda Crossings. 

Congrats to **Steve Joo** from Oakland’s **Joodooboo,** who was [named](https://www.sfgate.com/food/article/food-and-wine-magazine-oakland-best-new-chef-21037749.php) by _Food and Wine_ magazine as one of the country’s best new chefs of 2025.
