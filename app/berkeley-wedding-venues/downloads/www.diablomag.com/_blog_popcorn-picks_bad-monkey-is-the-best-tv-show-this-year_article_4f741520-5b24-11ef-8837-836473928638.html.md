![Screen-Shot-2024-08-14-at-3.52.41-PM.jpg](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAQAAAADCAQAAAAe/WZNAAAAEElEQVR42mM8U88ABowYDABAxQPltt5zqAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)

Fans of the great crime novelist Carl Hiaasen are in for a huge treat this month as _Bad Monkey_ premieres on Apple TV+. The 10-episode series is the first filmed adaptation of Hiaasen’s work to get the Florida author’s delightful sense of humor and Sunshine State satire just right. (Apologies to the filmmakers who tried hard with _Striptease_ and _Hoot,_ neither of which quite worked as movies.)

In _Bad Monkey,_ showrunner Bill Lawrence (_Ted Lasso_) adapts Hiaasen’s 2013 best-seller with perfect brush strokes, shooting in the book’s locations of Miami, Key West, and the Bahamas in all their colorful, widescreen glory. He’s also working with an absolutely stacked cast of gifted comic actors, starting with Vince Vaughn in a pitch perfect lead role as Andrew Yancey, a former police detective turned restaurant inspector. Years ago, I read that Vaughn was cast in a reboot of _The Rockford Files_ that never aired, thank god. As horrified as I was to hear that a blasphemous _Rockford_ remake was being discussed, the idea of Vaughn as Rockford 2.0 was intriguing. Years later, Vaughn in a Hiaasen adaptation is the perfect substitute, the actor’s fast-talking wiseguy antihero is absolutely perfect.

Also terrific, quirky, and having the time of their lives onscreen are Rob Delaney (_Deadpool 2_), Meredith Hagner (_Search Party_), Michelle Monaghan (_Kiss Kiss Bang Bang_), Natalie Martinez (_CSI: NY_), Zach Braff (_Scrubbs_), Alex Moffat (_Saturday Night Live_), and Jodie Turner-Smith (_Queen and Slim_). I won’t get into describing each actor’s character, as this could lead to spoilers, and part of the thrill of _Bad Monkey_ is letting Lawrence sprinkle Hiaasen’s outrageous narrative across each hourlong episode. I will say that the titular monkey is perfectly cast and part of his Johnny Depp _Pirate_ movie backstory is salvaged for the show.

Between the sunsets, rum-soaked dialogue, and diabolically bonkers storyline—which begins when a Florida fishing charter pulls a severed arm out of the ocean—the masterstroke in _Bad Monkey_ is a soundtrack packed with Tom Petty’s songs covered by a range of artists. Like Hiaasen, Petty was a native Floridian, and his music perfectly punctuates each episode.

I had a chance to interview Hiaasen about _Bad Monkey_ in front of a packed house at Rakestraw Books in Danville, just after the book was released. I also interviewed him at Rakestraw Books for his previous novel, _Star Island._ Here are the audience questions from one of those events.

Hiaasen talks about the story as well as his writing process and his thoughts about satire. Please share these clips with other Hiaasen fans to enjoy between Bad Monkey episodes—the first two are available on Apple TV+ on August 14, then one episode release each week through October 9.

Enjoy the show, television does not get better than this.
