Koffi Noir helps customers show their personal style through semi-bespoke shoes.

“Shoes are just extensions of who we are; why not have a pair of quality shoes represent you?” asks Dieudonné Brou, the creative force behind semi-bespoke shoe brand Koffi Noir.

Growing up in Oakland—his father’s family is from Côte d’Ivoire—Brou didn’t have the financial resources for status footwear like Air Jordans. “I always tried to dress a little differently,” he recalls. “I was wearing Asics or New Balance sneakers, and now Gen Z is wearing shoes that I would get laughed at for wearing back then.”

Following time in prison beginning when he was a teenager—at one point, he was stabbed in his sleep during a race riot—Brou changed his trajectory. He double majored in socio­logy and African American studies at the University of California, Los Angeles and worked for social justice in various advocacy groups. His move into footwear came when he was unable to find well-made, stylish shoes at local retailers. “When I went into department stores looking for shoes, I couldn’t find anything that spoke to me,” he says. “It felt natural to do this.”

Despite his lack of design experience, Brou threw himself into the idea of custom-made luxury shoes and launched Koffi Noir in 2019. Working with a tannery in Almansa, Spain, he designs made-to-order, semi-bespoke loafers, trainers, boots, and dress shoes. The brand prioritizes quality materials, sustainability, and fair working conditions. “I want to make sure I am providing quality footwear—something that is a little different,” says Brou, who has produced navy blue python boots and camouflage loafers for customers. “I want to make it fun. I want my clients to have shoes that ... reflect their authentic selves.”

Unlike fully bespoke shoes, which can cost in the multi-thousands and take six months to a year to make, a pair of Brou’s shoes is typically finished within three months and has a less exorbitant price tag. For example, Koffi Noir’s dress shoes cost $550–$625; loafers range from $400–$490.

Brou says his most high-profile effort to date involved an outfit worn by bass baritone Ryan McKinny for the opening night of _Dead Man Walking_ at the Metropolitan Opera House in 2023. McKinny wore a pair of purple wholecut oxfords by Koffi Noir, which featured a black rose painted by Oakland muralist Timothy B. _Vogue_ even featured a photo of McKinny on the red carpet.

Customers can connect with Koffi Noir online, but Brou hopes to open a brick-and-mortar store. “[Having] community interactions and connections is so important,” he says. “I want to create a space where people actually want to be, whether they are buying shoes or not.” _[koffinoir.com](http://koffinoir.com)._
