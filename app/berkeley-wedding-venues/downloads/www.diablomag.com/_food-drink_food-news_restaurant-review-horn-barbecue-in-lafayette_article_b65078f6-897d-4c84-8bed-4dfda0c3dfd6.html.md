Lamorinda diners are now able to sample Matt Horn’s popular Texas-style barbecue.

Nico Oved

Horn Barbecue … in Lafayette? It was an out-of-the-blue bombshell dropped without warning or typical PR hype when Oakland-based pitmaster Matt Horn announced in mid-December that he was opening the second brick-and-mortar location of his acclaimed barbecue joint—two days later. And just like that, one of the nation’s most vaunted—albeit recently tarnished—smoked meat operations was up and running in an area better known for its schools and standard of living than low-and-slow, down-and-dirty Texas brisket.

Yet the move isn’t as odd as it seemed at first blush. After all, Horn is occupying hallowed ground—at least in terms of suburban East Bay barbecue lineage—on Mt. Diablo Boulevard, where the beloved Bo’s Barbecue operated for well over a decade, followed by an eight-year run by Bonehead’s Texas BBQ and a brief stint by All the Smoke BBQ. As for Horn, Lafayette presents both an untapped market and perhaps a chance for something of a fresh start on the other side of the East Bay hills.

It’s been a tumultuous couple of years for the California pitmaster, who shot to foodie fame after capitalizing on his sold-out, viral barbecue pop-ups to open Horn Barbecue in West Oakland in 2020.

That location shuttered after a devastating fire in late 2023—an arson investigation was initiated and the flagship relocated to Old Oakland last year—while Horn himself has been the subject of a wave of legal issues stemming from financial disputes with former business partners, vendors, and employees.

So, locals could be forgiven for a healthy dose of skepticism about the sudden Lamorinda sidestep. Horn, however, says he is quite familiar with the area, which he has visited often with his family.

Horn Barbecue’s Lafayette location offers a cozy interior with large windows.

Brandon Ruffin

“Lafayette is a town that feels like home to me, a place that has always been full of warmth and charm,” Horn notes. “When the opportunity to open a location there arose, it felt like the perfect next step.”

And it does feel like a good fit. That site has been, and continues to be, a great setting for barbecue: The open layout and easy parking comfortably accommodate big crowds and lines, while its location a little off the main downtown action makes it feel like a hidden oasis.

There’s also plenty of room for Horn’s in-house smoker, which helped alleviate concerns that the Lafayette location would serve as a receptacle for Oakland-made spillover.

“We are committed to smoking our meat where it’s served,” says Horn. “The process has always been about doing the work on-site, and Lafayette will be no different.”

Guests have a clear view of the carving station.

Ethan Fletcher

That commitment shows. A line had already started to queue up before the noon lunch opening on my first visit, but I was soon rewarded with a view of the carving station where staff was busy slicing brisket, sectioning ribs, and assembling pulled-pork sandwiches.

The straightforward menu offers brisket, ribs, and pulled pork by the pound, whole and half chicken, sausages, sandwiches, sides, and a couple of desserts. The main attraction of any Texas-style barbecue joint is the brisket—and Horn’s doesn’t disappoint. The prime cut is smoked for hours, and it’s immensely satisfying to see the deeply dark exterior “bark” cut open to reveal a beautifully pink interior. Horn exhibits a light touch with his headliner, which is a little less smoky and seasoned than others I’ve tried, letting the meat do the talking. But talk it does. The meat is rich and tender, contrasted nicely by a perimeter of crispy crust and fatty smoke ring. Does it measure up to the luscious, melt-in-your-mouth standard of the top Texas barbecue operations like Franklin Barbecue in Austin or even young upstart Fikscue Craft Barbecue in Alameda? Not quite, but it’s damn good and worth braving the lines, omnipresent since opening. (Horn says he expects issues like that and sold-out items to ease with time.)

On the other end of the spectrum from the brisket, the pork spare ribs are packed with flavor. Smaller and leaner, they feature liberally seasoned exteriors with an intense peppery, salty, sweet caramelized crust faintly reminiscent of beef jerky. Think of them as the snappy, snacky counterpoint to the beef ribs, which are essentially brisket on a stick. I actually preferred those behemoths to the brisket: The bone infuses added succulent flavor, while the higher crust-to-meat ratio lends more seasoning with each bite. Sandwiches are amply stuffed and presented simply on squishy potato rolls. The pulled pork features just slaw and BBQ sauce. It’s tasty and generous, but make sure to throw on a few pickled red onions to lend some zip to the meat, which isn’t as saucy or seasoned as its Carolina-style equivalent.

Speaking of sauce, feel free to put Horn’s addictive house product on anything: It’s not too syrupy and offers a great balance of sweet and tang with just a touch of heat.

For sides, the mac and cheese is totally satisfying, with dense, dairy-packed shells. The pit beans deliver an upscale, sweet-and-tangy version of Boston baked beans. I also enjoyed the granny potatoes, an ultra-gooey marriage of mac and cheese and potato salad. One final tip, even if you think you’ll be stuffed: The delightful banana pudding is a perfect, feather-light dessert finale. And keep an eye out for an “off-the-grill menu” expected to launch this spring.

For his part, Horn is saying all the right things and seems committed to a full comeback for his barbecue empire, which was expected to open another branch just south of Sacramento in February.

“The past few years have tested me in ways I could never have imagined,” he says. “Yet, through every trial, my resolve has only grown stronger, and my faith has deepened. We are not defined by adversity. We are defined by our response, our commitment, and the impact we have on the lives of those around us.”

Time will tell—but in Lafayette, Horn is off to a strong start. _[hornbarbecue.com](http://hornbarbecue.com)._
