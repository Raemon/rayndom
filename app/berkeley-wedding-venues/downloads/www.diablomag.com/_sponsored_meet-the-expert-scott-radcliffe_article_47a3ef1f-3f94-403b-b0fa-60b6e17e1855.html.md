Scott Radcliffe is a partner of Alves Radcliffe LLP, a boutique litigation firm located in Alamo, representing clients in business, construction, and real estate disputes. Scott has been recognized by Super Lawyers as an attorney with demonstrated expertise in his field; a designation earned by only the top 2.5% of lawyers in California.

#### Q: What are the main steps homeowners should take when hiring a contractor for a construction project?

**A:** Verify the contractor’s license and whether they carry insurance. Licensure and workers compensation insurance can be verified with the CSLB website at [www.cslb.ca.gov](http://www.cslb.ca.gov). For home improvement contracts, contractors are required to tell you if they carry Commercial General Liability (CGL) insurance. It is strongly recommended that you hire a contractor that does carry CGL insurance.

Ensure you have a written contract that clearly defines the parties’ obligations and expectations. The contract should state all essential terms including contract price, a schedule of progress payments if applicable, quantity of materials, and the start date and estimated completion date. The more detail in your contract, the better. Build in a process to deal with any disputes, from mediation to arbitration or going to court. For larger projects, it is worthwhile to hire a knowledgeable construction attorney to review the contract before you begin.

#### Q: How can homeowners protect themselves?

**A:** Make sure the contractor obtains a building permit before starting any work. For home improvement projects, avoid paying more of a deposit than you are required to. The law prohibits a contractor from taking more than 10 percent of the contract value or $1,000, whichever is greater. You should negotiate a retention provision in your contract that allows you to hold back 10 percent or more of the contract value until the job is done. That gives the contractor a motivation to satisfy your expectations. Document the construction with photos and videos at every phase. If your project ends up in a dispute, you can accurately show what the conditions were at each phase. If something goes wrong, read your contract and make sure you are following it; express your concerns in writing; meet with your contractor to discuss issues; and give the contractor an opportunity to correct any problems.

If you and your contractor have unsuccessfully tried to work it out, then it’s time to consult an attorney to determine your options. One thing that sets my firm apart is our expertise in overlapping areas of the law, including business, construction, and real estate. Our clients don’t have to hire a team of multiple attorneys to prosecute complex cases. I’m an aggressive advocate and I prepare every case as if it is going to trial. This gives us the ability to obtain maximum results for our clients.
