Camp in comfort at Mendocino Grove.

Sarah M. Gonzalez/Peopletography

The small seaside village of **Mendocino** and its environs can be a study in contrasts. Downtown is dotted with elegant Victorians and traditional saltbox houses that give old-fashioned New England vibes (the Mendocino and Headlands district was named to the National Register of Historic Places in 1971). A collection of art galleries, shops, and restaurants adds to the charm, while the rugged bluffs of **Mendocino Headlands State Park,** which surround the village on three sides, provide plenty of drama. **Big River Beach** offers opportunities to play in the driftwood-dusted sand and appreciate the wildlife; marine birds, seals, otters, and more make **Big River Estuary** their home.

A stay at the nearby **Mendocino Grove** campground promises a similar mix of serenity, classic comfort, and a striking natural setting. Although the town has a wealth of bed and breakfasts and inns, glamping at the Grove—which marks its 10-year anniversary in 2025—is a unique experience that is equally suited to couples, families, and big groups.

Deck chairs, heated beds, and cotton linens are a few of the amenities at Mendocino Grove.

### Wooded Bliss

Break up the three-hour-plus drive from the East Bay—a portion of it on curvy Highway 128—with stops in towns such as **Healdsburg, Geyserville,** and **Boonville,** or visit the wineries of **Anderson Valley.** Dense redwoods and coastal fog help keep the latter half of the route cool, even in the summer heat, while views of the Pacific Ocean provide distraction as you get closer to Mendocino Grove’s address on Highway 1.

The spacious campground is open from late April through November and features safari-style tents of varying sizes that are perched on wooden platforms. Although evenings can get cold, the comfortable beds are equipped with heated blankets, and each site has a fire ring that provides both warmth and an open-flame cooking option. Mendocino Grove offers s’mores kits; camp boxes that include a pan, oil, utensils, and plateware; and firewood for a fee (a campfire valet will even help get your flame started), though there are also gas barbecues throughout the grounds. The tents come with lanterns, deck chairs, towels, and lockboxes for food storage, and two well-appointed communal bathrooms have showers and sinks for dishwashing.

Guests can enjoy a farm-to-table-focused meal prepared by chef Chantelle Sookram during Friday Night Dinners in the Meadow Commons (beer and wine may be bought separately). Return to the Meadow Commons in the morning for complimentary coffee, tea, or hot cocoa and a light breakfast, with additional items available for purchase. Even if you eat at your campsite or in Mendocino (try the espresso drinks at **Wingspan Coffee**), the Commons is the only spot where WiFi is available, in case you can’t totally unplug; it also has games, hammocks, occasional live music, and other special events.

Those looking for rejuvenation should sign up for weekend yoga sessions, relax in the dry sauna or recently added redwood shower, or book an on-site massage. Walk the grounds by yourself or on a guided nature hike, and enjoy ocean vistas from the Mendocino Bay Overlook—although the tranquil wooded setting is lovely on its own. Cross the road to **Catch a Canoe and Bicycles, Too** and rent a kayak or canoe to explore Big River.

Mendocino’s Trillium Cafe serves California cuisine in an inviting environment.

### Coastal Cuisine

For off-site adventures, take the short drive to the town of Mendocino. Explore the shops—make sure to stop at **Mendocino Chocolate Company** for gourmet truffles—and look for camp provisions at **Harvest Market at Mendosa’s.** For an exceptional meal of fresh seafood and other fabulous fare, consider **Trillium Cafe, Café Beaujolais,** or the plant-forward menu at **Terra Mar Kitchen.** Chef Sebastian Kaplan recently took over the kitchen at the **Little River Inn Restaurant,** serving delicious dinners highlighting local ingredients.

Another can’t-miss dining spot is in Fort Bragg, about 20 minutes away. **Princess Seafood Restaurant,** located in Noyo Harbor where the Noyo River meets the Pacific Ocean, has water views and fresh-caught seafood; top menu items include the crab roll and poke bowl. Princess, founded by two female best friends with years of fishing on their résumés, also has a market nearby if you want to take something back to camp to grill. Or treat yourself to a singular experience and book an advance reservation at **Harbor House** in the small town of Elk (around 16 miles south of Mendocino). The two-star Michelin restaurant focuses on responsibly sourced sea-to-table cuisine.

Culture lovers may want to check out local artists at **Mendocino Art Center** or mark their calendars for the **Mendocino Music Festival,** happening July 12–26, and the **Mendocino Film Festival** (held next spring).

Explore miles of scenic trails at Mendocino Headlands State Park.

### Bluff Times

The region’s top draw, however, has to be its dazzling coastline. Miles of state beaches and parks hold a treasure trove of crashing waves, jagged cliffs, sea caves, tide pools, and a range of activities. **Russian Gulch State Park** has a little bit of everything, including the Instagram-ready Frederick W. Panhorst Bridge and the Devil’s Punchbowl, a collapsed sea cave that is 100 feet wide and 60 feet deep. Hike along the Headlands Trail, or go inland along the Fern Canyon Trail to see a 36-foot waterfall. Those hoping to swim and fish should try the beach near the mouth of Russian Gulch Creek, in the shadow of the Panhorst Bridge.

**Van Damme State Park** offers activities such as hiking, diving, and kayaking; there is also a forest of pygmy cypress trees. The 347 acres that make up Mendocino Headlands State Park include miles of trails along the 70-foot bluffs. Watch the fog roll in over the sea arches, or spot migrating grey whales during the winter and wildflowers during the spring. Get a sense of regional history at **Ford House** visitor center.

**Glass Beach** (technically three beaches) near Fort Bragg is a photographer’s dream, with shards of smooth sea glass decorating the shore. A result of residents dumping refuse there during the early-to-mid-1900s, the sand now features a rainbow of polished glass.

Glass Beach—like the rest of the region—will leave visitors with a lasting sense of wonder at the beauty and magic that lies in Mendocino County.
