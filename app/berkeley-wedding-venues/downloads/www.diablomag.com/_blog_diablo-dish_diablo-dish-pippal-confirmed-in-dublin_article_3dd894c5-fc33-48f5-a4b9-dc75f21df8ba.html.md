### Pippal to Bring Bollywood Flair to Dublin

The long-hinted arrival of [Pippal](https://www.pippaldublin.com) in Dublin has been confirmed—and it’ll arrive with a little celebrity star power. The second location of the contemporary Indian concept from the restaurant group behind Pippal in Emeryville, as well as Rooh, Fitoor, Alora, and Alora Social, will launch this fall in the former Coco Cabana space. However, the lead actors behind Pippal Dublin are husband-wife team Carolina and Jatin Bunty Grewal, the latter of whom spent years as an acclaimed actor and model in India. And in fact, it was Jatin’s extensive travels through India for his movie, television, and modeling work that inspired his and his wife’s passion for the country’s diverse regional cuisines, an emphasis at Pippal. The restaurant’s kitchen, helmed by Rooh Delhi and Pippal Emeryville head chef Munish Rana, will “meld modern regional dishes with fresh California ingredients.” You can check out Pippal Emeryville’s [menu here](https://www.eatatpippal.com/files/pippal-food-menu-new-5-pdf-pdf.pdf). 

There will also be a full bar with signature Indian-inflected cocktails and a private dining room for events and parties. This will be the second high-profile modern Indian concept to land in the area recently after the debut in San Ramon’s City Center Bishop Ranch of **Khaki Bar and Indian Canteen,** a collaboration between Curry Up Now founder Akash Kapoor and Michelin-starred chef Pujan Sarkar. 

### Restaurant Week Kicks off Friday at San Ramon’s City Center

Speaking of City Center, the upscale San Ramon shopping center is kicking off its 10-day restaurant week, **Taste of City Center,** this Friday with prix-fixe menus, limited-time dishes, and exclusive offers at participating restaurants, including Alora Social, Bamboo Sushi, Delarosa, LB Steak, the Slanted Door, and the above-mentioned Khaki. This year’s festivities also include the September Sips wine tasting on September 28 and a first-ever cocktail competition happening this Sunday, September 21, from 5-7 p.m. at Social Affair (yours truly may even be there as a guest judge). [Click here](https://sr.bishopranch.com/tasteofcitycenter) for all the details.

### Spanish Tapas on the Menu in Downtown Livermore

A new authentic Spanish tapas restaurant is up and running in Livermore. [**L Campo**](https://lcampo.com/en/) debuted a couple of weeks ago on First Street downtown, bringing 24-month-aged jamón Ibérico, patatas bravas, vegetable croquettes, and pulpo _a la parrilla_ among some 20 shared-plate starters on the opening dinner menu. The kitchen also offers chicken, seafood, and mushroom paellas for two; entrées such as grilled cod and whole lamb shanks with glazed turnips; and churros, orange flan, almond cake, and cinnamon rice pudding for dessert. The wine list, meanwhile, balances northern California and Spanish labels. According to co-owner **Anna Gundogdu,** the tapas concept came from L Campo chef **Torsten Schulz,** who brings decades of experience at high-end restaurants across the U.S. and Europe, including Spain and Portugal. 

### Colorful Ruby Lou’s Headed for Downtown Walnut Creek

Well, this sounds fun. **Ruby Lou’s Boujee Bites and Games** is plotting a November opening in downtown Walnut Creek in the space previously occupied by Buon Vino wine bar. One peek at its [Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/p/DMepOneOnNm/) is enough to know that the vibe will be quite different. Described there as a restaurant with an arcade and cocktails (tagline: “Family by day—fabulous by night!”), the Ruby Lou’s maximalist aesthetic looks to be bold and bright—for example, a oversize 10-foot gumball machine will serve as the centerpiece for the interior. Based on those Instagram updates, the mastermind behind Ruby Lou’s is Megan Benshalom, a longtime bartender and mixologist in San Francisco who named the new concept after her three-year-old daughter. 

### Market and Main No More in Martinez

Public market **Market and Main** closed suddenly less than four years after launching with a splash in downtown Martinez. The striking food hall debuted in the heart of Main Street in late 2021, the brainchild of Malena Clegg and third-generation Martinez resident Krystal Endsley. While the upstairs bar space was popular, especially on weekends, Market and Main appeared to never quite hit its stride, with a rotating series of vendors seeming to cycle quickly through the contemporary ground floor space. Despite the closure, the venue did serve as a launching pad for several East Bay food businesses, including Small Change oyster bar in Oakland’s Temescal and Lafayette’s forthcoming Craft and Fire Taproom and Artisan Pizza.

And in another tough blow to downtown Martinez, longtime Thai favorite **Lemongrass Bistro** announced that it would be closing as of this Saturday. After 16 years operating for lunch and dinner at 501 Main Street, the owners were reportedly simply ready to retire.

### Small Bites From Around the East Bay

Craving the East Bay’s unofficial favorite dish? Concord’s annual [**Taco Trail Challenge**](https://www.visitconcordca.com/eat-drink/taco-trail/) is live! 

The **Shoya** sushi bar is open and drawing rave reviews at 2642 Pleasant Hill Road in Pleasant Hill.

Here’s a [nice write-up](https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2025/09/09/after-23-years-in-walnut-creek-pizza-oliva-is-gone-but-the-legacy-and-recipe-lives-on/) on **Ellie’s Pizzeria,** whose new owners are carrying on the proud dough-spinning tradition of longtime Walnut Creek favorite Pizza Oliva. 

Lauded and somewhat controversial chef **Andres Giraldo Florez** is [handing the reigns](https://www.sfgate.com/food/article/controversial-bay-area-bar-owner-leaves-america-21043576.php) of his eclectic Oakland small plates concept **Snail Bar** to two chefs and a former employee. Florez is reportedly leaving the country to take over operations of an inn in the south of France. 

There are two East Bay ties to Bon Appétit’s new [list of top 20 restaurants](https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-new-restaurants-2025) in the country. The first: Oakland’s Michelin-starred **Sun Moon Studio,** which keeps racking up awards. The second: Fernay McPherson’s **Minnie Bell’s Soul Movement,** which started as a food stall in Emeryville’s Public Market before launching as a brick-and-mortar restaurant in San Francisco last year. 

Chef-owner **Reem Assil** ’s planned production bakery and take-out café in Jack London Square was the only East Bay spot mentioned in the _San Francisco Chronicle_ ’s [list of 12 most anticipated Bay Area restaurants](https://www.sfchronicle.com/food/restaurants/article/new-restaurant-food-bay-area-20814897.php).
