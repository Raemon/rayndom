In May, when former President Joe Biden shared that he has prostate cancer that metastasized to his bones, the announcement drew renewed attention to a disease that impacts millions of men. Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers among men in the United States, and there has been a sharp increase in cases diagnosed in advanced stages in recent years, according to a September report from the American Cancer Society. 

Experts have cited a recommendation against periodic prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based screening by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) in 2012 as one possible correlation, with more cancers being discovered in late stages due to a decrease in routine screenings. In 2018, USPSTF changed the recommendation, saying men ages 55 to 69 should discuss the benefits and risks of PSA testing with their health-care provider; the USPSTF is in the process of updating its prostate cancer screening recommendation.

Like most cancer screenings, PSA tests can help identify disease early, allowing people to make informed decisions around their health and partner with their care providers on a treatment plan that is right for them. Treatments vary widely depending on the individual’s overall health and age, how fast the cancer is growing, and if it is localized to the prostate or if it has spread to other areas. 

“I’d encourage men dealing with prostate cancer to feel empowered to seek out more information, take charge of their health, and work with their physician to discuss the clinical implications of treatment, including the side effects,” says Michael Sherman, M.D., Ph.D., founder and medical director of Contra Costa Oncology in Walnut Creek.

### **Primary Prostate Concerns**

“The prostate is often called the imperfect organ,” says urologist Sidney Wilberforce, M.D., chief of urology in the Diablo service area for Kaiser Permanente. “It’s a small gland that is unique to males, but it can present a spectrum of issues and potential conditions. The prostate has a dual function for the urinary and reproductive systems.”

Along with cancer, the most common conditions that impact the prostate are benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostatitis. BPH stems from benign growth of the prostate tissue that may cause urinary urgency, weak stream, and frequency; leakage of urine; burning; and/or blood in the urine. Prostatitis is inflammation of the prostate and has similar symptoms to BPH, along with scrotal, rectal, and/or pelvic pain. Prostatitis impacts younger men as well as older individuals and can be treated with medications such as antibiotics, anti-inflammatories, and alpha blockers to relax the prostate. Alpha blockers are used to treat BPH by relaxing the prostate as well, along with medications to shrink the prostate and surgical interventions. 

In its earlier stages, prostate cancer may not present with symptoms, making screening all the more critical. “Most prostate cancer diagnoses are made in the absence of symptoms,” says Wilberforce. “PSA testing can reveal microscopic disease early. The most important thing men can do to look after their health is engage with their physician about preventive screenings and report any urologic symptoms. Be in tune with your body, and if something’s not feeling right, raise the issue with your provider.”

Adds Sherman, “Pay attention to your symptoms. It doesn’t always mean you have prostate cancer if you are peeing all night—it could be bladder spasms, it could be benign prostatic hyperplasia—but it is a sign to see your doctor, get an exam, and have your PSA checked.”

### **Screenings and Recommendations**

A PSA test is a simple assessment that measures the levels of prostate-specific antigen in the blood; high levels can indicate prostate cancer, along with other noncancerous conditions. Digital rectal exams are also part of a full urological workup. A physician might follow a high PSA result with a tissue biopsy or prostate MRI. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET scans can be used to identify metastatic prostate cancer.

“PSA testing is essential for maintaining prostate health,” says Peter Greene, M.D., a Bass Medical Group urologist in Pleasant Hill. “Usually the higher the PSA, the higher the risk of finding prostate cancer,” says Greene. “If someone comes in with an initial PSA that is above 4 and below 10, there is about a 25 percent chance of finding cancer on a prostate biopsy. If I see a patient [in that range], I repeat the PSA test at a three-to-six-month interval. I also use a new urine test called ExoDx, which patients can do at home, that’s very good at excluding prostate cancer.”

Greene recommends men at average risk for prostate cancer start PSA testing at age 55 and screen every other year until they have a 10-year life expectancy. A family history of prostate cancer is another risk factor that should inform timing around screening. 

“That family history could include cousins with prostate cancer, not just close male relatives like your father or grandfather,” adds Wilberforce. “The other [main] genetic risk factor would be African heritage.”

The American Cancer Society suggests that men at high risk—those with close family members who were diagnosed with prostate cancer under the age of 65 or who are of African heritage—start discussing screening at age 45; those of average risk should begin the conversation at age 50.

“Screening is absolutely critical. These are addressable, treatable issues, and you’ve got to be armed with information so that you can make decisions related to diagnostics, treatment, and management. [Having this knowledge] gives men confidence that they are maximizing their health,” says Wilberforce. “Family members and loved ones should also encourage the men in their lives to [screen] and report any urinary issues. Many men need that intimate nudge to get evaluated.”

### **Treating Prostate Cancer**

There is a wide range of treatments available depending on the type and stage of prostate cancer. They may involve active surveillance, in which the care provider (likely a urologist) does repeat PSA tests and biopsies to monitor changes; radiation therapy; and surgery. Local medical facilities such as John Muir Health, Kaiser Permanente, and San Ramon Regional Medical Center offer robotic-assisted prostate surgeries that are less

invasive and result in quicker recovery times. If the cancer has metastasized outside of the prostate, treatments may include hormone therapy to block testosterone production, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and targeted therapies that specifically attack cancer cells. The potential side effects of treatments also vary but may cause erectile dysfunction, incontinence, decreased libido, hot flashes, and other impacts.

“There are many equivalent treatments in prostate cancer,” says Greene. “Whatever treatment path you take with your physician will have beneficial results. If you don’t feel good about the conversations you are having, second opinions are highly valuable. Prostate cancer is such a slow-growing disease; you have time. No one should ever make you feel rushed into a specific treatment.”

Contra Costa Oncology began offering Pluvicto, a targeted molecular therapy that extends survival in patients with PSMA-positive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, earlier this year; this is an advanced prostate cancer that no longer responds to hormone treatment to lower testosterone. In March, the U.S. Food and Drug Admin­istration expanded the use of Pluvicto for patients with that cancer; the therapy had previously been limited to a post-chemotherapy treatment.

“It’s a radioactive isotope linked to an antibody that is specific for prostate cancer. It goes everywhere the prostate cancer has spread,” says Sherman. “We are the first

in the East Bay to offer Pluvicto to patients. The treatment is given once every six weeks for six treatments, and it has been shown to boost survival in people with prostate cancer by 30 percent. It’s a real game changer.”

Provenge is another therapy used for men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer that can extend life by reprogramming the immune system to target and attack the disease. “It’s an immunotherapy where we stimulate your white blood cells with prostate cancer cells so they rev up the immune system and attack the cancer,” says Sherman.

He reiterates the significance of cancer patients advocating for themselves, seeking multiple opinions, and understanding the risks and benefits of their treatment options. “Knowledge is power,” Sherman says. Having emotional support is also important. Contra Costa Oncology even has a mentorship program so patients can share their experiences with one another.

### **Habits to Benefit Your Health**

When it comes to caring for your prostate, doctors suggest following the same lifestyle habits that support heart health. “Being mindful on the dietary front is very important; lower consumption of red meat, reduce saturated fats and sugar, and eat more cruciferous vegetables,” says Wilberforce. “Weight management and regular exercise all can reduce risk of prostate cancer development and improve overall health.”
