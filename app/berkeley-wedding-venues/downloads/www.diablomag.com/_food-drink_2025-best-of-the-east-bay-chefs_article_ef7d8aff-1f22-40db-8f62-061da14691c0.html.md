**Whether it’s crafting immaculate tasting menus in west Oakland, masterminding a sprawling gourmet sports bar in Pleasanton, or setting the vibe for the hottest nightlife draw in the region, East Bay chefs and restaurateurs continue to work on the cutting edge of the local food scene.**

* * *

![DM2507_082_DIG.jpg](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAQAAAADCAQAAAAe/WZNAAAAEElEQVR42mM8U88ABowYDABAxQPltt5zqAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)

The creative tasting menu at Sun Moon Studio spotlights local food producers and farmers.

### **MAVERICK CHEFS**

The term “handmade” can be used a little loosely. That’s not the case at Sun Moon Studio, where just about everything really is handcrafted by chef-owners Alan Hsu and Sarah Cooper, from the silken tofu topped with Santa Barbara uni to the polenta sourdough for the buttermilk biscuits to the ceramic tea bowls (seriously, Hsu makes those himself). The young couple met while working at New York’s famed Blue Hill at Stone Barns—Cooper rising early to bake, Hsu working late dinner shifts—and launched their joint project last year in a tiny space in industrial west Oakland. There they worked in relative obscurity, preparing their inventive double-digit-course tasting menus two nights a week; the meals were served to a maximum of 12 guests at a time occupying a dining room that holds only four tables. But talent always wins out, and the restaurant’s cover was blown last December after the _San Francisco Chronicle_ named it the best restaurant to open in the Bay Area in 2024. Despite upping its hours to four nights a week, Sun Moon remains perhaps the Bay Area’s toughest reservation—even with its recent move to OpenTable. Previously, Hsu and Cooper had been taking reservations themselves, by hand.

Chef Francis X. Hogan continues to expand his restaurant portfolio with sports bar concept Pivot.

### MASTER OF HIS CRAFT

Francis X. Hogan has already conquered fine dining at Pleasanton’s Sabio on Main and pulled off a foodie bar with Danville’s Crush’d Wine Bar and Kitchen. What’s next for the accomplished chef? A sports bar. Yes, Hogan is tackling that most egalitarian of concepts with Pivot, an ambitious new two-story project in Pleasanton. Set to open any day, the restaurant will boast flat-screen TVs, two Top Swing virtual golf simulators, and three private luxury suites. As for the food, imagine Buffalo Wild Wings but elevated to the nth degree. Hogan’s chicken wings involve a two-day process in which they are brined, dried, confit-ed, and finished in the fryer and served with homemade dipping sauces. Mozzarella sticks will be hand-breaded, fries cut daily from fresh potatoes, and nachos smothered in smoked pork belly. There will also be steaks and chops cooked on a wood-fired char grill. With food this good, you might even forget there’s a game on.

### TRENDSETTERS

When NBA power forward Draymond Green decided to jump into the San Francisco restaurant scene, he tapped two industry vets from across the Bay for help. And it was Guma Fassil, with his ties to the local nightlife scene and experience growing up at his mother’s restaurant in Berkeley, who first pitched Green on the idea for a supper club. The pair found their chef during an after-hours visit to Nelson German’s Uptown lounge, Sobre Mesa. Green fell for the Oakland restaurateur’s Afro-Latin-inspired fare and tapped him to lead the kitchen at his buzzy new concept that debuted in March. Meski quickly became a destination, and while Green’s star appeal helped, it’s the multicultural energy and flavor—think live DJs paired with contemporary Ethiopian-Dominican fare—infused by his partners that laid the foundation for success.
