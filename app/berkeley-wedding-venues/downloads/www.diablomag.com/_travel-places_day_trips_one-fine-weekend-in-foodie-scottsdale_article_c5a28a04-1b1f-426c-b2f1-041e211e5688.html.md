Toro Scottsdale features an inspired pan-Latin menu from acclaimed chef Richard Sandoval.

Paul Markow

The landscape in and around **Scottsdale, Arizona,** is one of intense natural beauty, from its sacred rock formations to its desert, lakes, and streams. A two-hour flight from the East Bay, it’s also a growing destination for world-class cuisine that celebrates local ranches, farms, and wineries.

A stay at the storied **Fairmont Scottsdale Princess** puts you in the epicenter of the area’s culinary hot spots, beginning with **Toro Scottsdale** on the luxury resort’s 65-acre Sonoran Desert property. The newly reimagined restaurant inside the clubhouse of TPC Scottsdale is a far cry from most golf property dining experiences. Under the direction of celebrity chef Richard Sandoval, the pan-Latin menu features imaginative dishes like poke guacamole and coconut ceviche in a sexy, low-light lounge. A signature seafood experience is the “suviche” bar, a sushi and ceviche raw bar that combines Asian and Latin influences. Main courses at Toro Scottsdale include lobster fried rice—whole small lobster tails atop savory rice rimmed with fresh vegetables. Scallops and pork belly are another menu standout, served on a bed of polenta with a drizzle of creamy mojo butter.

Italian-inspired steak house the Americano also offers seafood entrées like this wood-roasted halibut.

Innovative cocktails are a specialty at Toro Scottsdale. Order the Japanese Whisky Old Fashioned, and the bartender pours the amber liquid into your glass tableside, over a single large ice cube. It’s a seductive visual and so is the venue’s real entertainment—a fire dancer performing in front of Toro Scottsdale’s centerpiece bar on Friday and Saturday nights.

Nearby, there’s a glitzy supper club and speakeasy in north Scottsdale you won’t want to miss. **The Americano** is an Italian-inspired steak house with a warm, sophisticated vibe. Beau MacMillan, one of Scottsdale’s most celebrated chefs and a Food Network regular, helps lead the culinary team in preparing everything from prime steaks to pastas, salads, and seafood.

After dinner, guests with reservations are led to a hidden door and stairs that descend to a glitzy Roaring Twenties–style speakeasy with silver disco balls and gold lighting. A jazz combo plays onstage in this underground lounge with bar and table seating, as well as velvet-curtained booths for those seeking privacy. The signature libation—Jazz Age Smolder—is ceremoniously unveiled in a small vault, revealing a cocktail crafted with 12-year-aged scotch and shrouded in sweet orange smoke. The “secret” and ultra-swanky lounge is aptly named **Tell Your Friends.**

Old Town Scottsdale is home to the Frybread Lounge, which serves well-crafted Indigenous dishes including bison asada tacos and a fry bread flight with dipping sauces.

### Global Tastes

Scottsdale is an international destination, and its restaurants represent flavor profiles from countries around the world. For lovers of French cuisine, **Zinc Bistro** is an authentic Parisian café in the hip Kierland Commons shopping and dining area. Sidewalk seating puts you in the center of this romantic, tree-lined neighborhood. Zinc Bistro also has tables near a small fountain and a secluded candlelit garden patio.

The chef’s choice at Zinc Bistro is seared Hudson Valley foie gras, fromages from Europe and the United States, and an assortment of charcuterie. Entrées include Provençal bouillabaisse with fish, shrimp, mussels, olives, and fingerling potatoes in a tomato and saffron broth; herbed potato gnocchi with caramelized squash and pistachio pesto; and pinot-braised short ribs.

Arizona has long been known for its fry bread, and the **Frybread Lounge** in Old Town Scottsdale uses the doughy delight as a bun for its humongous bison burger. Chef Darryl Montana’s cooking is inspired by traditional tribal recipes, and fresh ingredients are purchased from Indigenous growers and producers. You won’t find chicken, pork, or beef at this Indigenous-owned eatery—just the juiciest buffalo in the region used in burgers and tacos. Tribal decor and haunting flute music add to the ambience.

Old Town Scottsdale is home to Western wear with desert flair, so you’ll want to spend time shopping and taking in attractions like **Western Spirit: Scottsdale’s Museum of the West.** Actor Kevin Costner recently raised big bucks for this Smithsonian affiliate with an impressive collection of Western art. Old Town Scottsdale is also known for its Thursday evening **ArtWalk, Scottsdale Historical Museum, Scottsdale Museum of Contemporary Art,** and the **Old Adobe Mission** —one of only three remaining adobe structures in the area.

Once you’ve worked up a thirst, there are a number of beverage options for everything from old-fashioned soda fountain treats to chilled margaritas and high-quality wines. There are seven wine tasting rooms in Old Town Scottsdale, including standouts **LDV Winery** and **Los Milics Vineyards.** LDV Winery wines are organic and unfiltered, taking advantage of the volcanic soil and high-altitude Chiricahua Mountain grapes grown in Southeast Arizona. Los Milics Vineyards uses grapes from the hills in Southern Arizona, one of the fastest-growing wine regions in the country.

Another local favorite in Old Town Scottsdale is **Beginner’s Luck.** Tucked in an alley that can be challenging to find, this intimate restaurant, known for its craft cocktails and ingredient-driven appetizers, is worth the search. Beginner’s Luck has an open kitchen and a long copper bar where patrons can enjoy a jalapeño-infused margarita for $7 from 3–5 p.m. during “Lucky Hour.” Outdoor seating is cool, too, with misters spritzing the air on hot days.

Paradise Valley mainstay El Chorro has welcomed diners since 1937.

Analisa Shah for Experience Scottsdale

### The Cowboy Way

Since ranching is a big part of Scottsdale’s history, a good way to experience the Old West is on horseback. Wranglers at **Saguaro Lake Guest Ranch** take riders on stunning trails through the Sonoran Desert and into the Goldfield Mountains. You may see wild horses as you amble past cactus and mesquite along the Lower Salt River and into the creosote-covered hills overlooking Saguaro Lake.

Continuing the Western theme, you won’t want to miss the iconic **El Chorro** restaurant in nearby Paradise Valley. This oasis in the Sonoran Desert dates back to 1937 and is known for its irresistible sticky buns—served warm in lieu of bread. Brunch is an El Chorro ritual, with dishes like lemon pancakes, hearty huevos rancheros, and spicy tamale bowls. Boozy bourbon-infused date shakes are both refreshing and fun. El Chorro is also a wedding and event destination, and the first restaurant in Arizona to earn the U.S. Green Building Council’s Leadership in Environmental and Energy Design (LEED) Gold Certification.

Scottsdale is a mecca for renowned resorts and spas that invite visitors to pamper themselves in luxurious desert surroundings. With its long growing season and fertile soil, it’s easy to see why so many highly acclaimed restaurants have opened in this upscale enclave.
