Tiki Tom’s bar manager Jennifer Crider crafts tropical drinks without alcohol.

Cali Godley 

The tinkle of an oversize ice cube hitting the side of a rocks glass. The glow of amber liquid or deep red wine under a bar light. Instagram- ready craft cocktails topped with bright garnishes and tall pint glasses filled with hoppy IPAs. Making a perfect martini (shaken or stirred). There is a certain glamour associated with drinking alcohol—and the social rituals around it—but more and more people are recognizing its downsides.

Gathering with loved ones to raise a celebratory flute of champagne or meeting up for beers with colleagues after work might be a common practice for those of legal drinking age, but alcohol consumption has waned among certain groups in recent years. A 2023 Gallup poll found a 10 percent decline in drinking over the past two decades reported by adults in the United States ages 18 to 34. (Alcohol consumption among adults who are 55-plus, however, went up 10 percent.) In general, wine and beer sales are decreasing, with wine down by 6 percent in 2024 compared to the year before.

Theories as to why members of Gen Z (those born between 1997 and 2012) are drinking less vary, with potential causes ranging from a cultural shift to the legalization of marijuana, but the health impacts of alcohol use are a consideration for drinkers of any age.

In January, the Office of the Surgeon General issued an advisory about the causal link between alcohol and the risk of developing at least seven different types of cancer, warning, “Alcohol consumption is the third leading preventable cause of cancer in the United States, after tobacco and obesity.”

Although recommendations for alcohol use have traditionally advised no more than one drink a day for women and two for men, “studies are showing that any amount [of alcohol] might be causing some health concerns,” says Kanwil Gill, M.D., a gastroenterologist at San Ramon Medical Center and John Muir Health. “Alcohol consumption affects many organs, mainly the liver. … If you drink earlier in life and continue to drink, the damage can persist and build up.”

He says people who cut out alcohol, follow a nutritious diet, and exercise regularly are more likely to recover from liver damage.

“Stopping is ideal, but if people drink wisely and have a healthy lifestyle, that would be the right balance,” Gill adds.

## BUZZ‑FREE BEVERAGES TAKE OFF

In addition to health concerns, people may not drink for religious or cultural reasons, because they are in recovery, or perhaps they simply do not enjoy the taste. Whatever the cause, interest in nonalcoholic (NA) beverages is on the rise globally, with the NA drink market projected to grow by more than 7 percent from 2024 to 2034. The category includes soft drinks, juice, tea, coffee, bottled water, and functional drinks (beverages that provide benefits such as energy, relaxation, or improved performance). Specifically, sales of NA wine, beer, and spirits increased nearly threefold from 2019 to 2023.

With more people leaning into an alcohol-light lifestyle, it is not surprising that more restaurants and bars are adding to their NA options, including mocktails that are picturesque enough for any social media feed. (The term “mocktail” is actually controversial, with some critics calling the label demeaning and negative; see the sidebar on page 33 for a few other naming variations.)

“People appreciate that we have a mocktails menu, rather than the soft drinks you might get at a typical bar,” says Jennifer Crider, bar manager at Walnut Creek hot spot Tiki Tom’s. “People come here for the atmosphere, the ambience. It is a tropical escape. If your friends are getting these drinks that are on fire and have little umbrellas and crazy garnishes, it’s not fun if you are just ordering soda water.”

There is also a sense of discovery for those who enjoy exploring the new wave of NA products popping up everywhere from liquor stores to major grocery retailers.

Jessica Moncada Konte is the cofounder of Alkali Rye, a beverage shop in Oakland that carries a wide selection of NA drinks, including functional beverages, craft sodas, and alcohol-free spirits and wines. She has seen a large increase in consumer demand and growth in the number of innovative drink options in the past five years.

“The [NA alternatives] that were available when we opened in 2020 were subtle or not great-tasting, and now we have options that are indistinguishable from [alcoholic drinks, along with] others that have such interesting profiles,” says Moncada Konte.

Alkali Rye offers a subscription club and tasting bar highlighting its NA options. Moncada Konte says her customers have even expressed their gratitude for the extensive inventory.

“Our sober community can be really emotional [about the shop],” she adds. “People have written to us and let us know how much they appreciate having such a wide selection of nonalcoholic beverages.”

## SOCIAL SPACES FOR EVERYONE

Husband-and-wife team Hetal and Dhruma Shah opened Sipeos Restaurant and Bar in Walnut Creek’s Broadway Plaza in December with the intent of establishing a gathering space offering drink selections for every taste.

“We have alcoholic beverages, low alcohol by volume (ABV) beverages, and NA cocktails. We want people to feel included when they come to celebrate at Sipeos,” says Hetal. “When we decided to stop drinking alcohol and went out with family and friends, it was always a little difficult for us to feel part of the celebration, because we were holding up a glass of water or juice. When we discovered these NA beverages, it changed the game for us.”

Adds Dhruma, “We want to have a place for everyone. That inclusivity was really important to us, as was making sure that everyone who comes here has an option.”

The San Ramon couple said they were initially targeting Gen Z and millennial audiences but are noticing many customers in their late 40s and early 50s.

“They are looking to be healthier. Alcohol doesn’t sit well with them,” says Hetal. “[They don’t] feel as energetic after an evening of drinking.”

Healthier fare is on the food menu as well, with a focus on plant-forward, California-Mediterranean cuisine. Dishes like the mezze plate pair with drinks such as the Pica Pica—made with tomatillos, cilantro, cucumber, and alcohol-free tequila—or the New-Groni, a negroni variation that complements the restaurant’s selection of _pinsas_ (flatbreads). The Shahs collaborated with West Bev Consulting to create NA and low-ABV drinks, such as the Salted Pineapple, that you can only find at Sipeos. Rather than calling them mocktails, which have a reputation for being overly sugary, the Shahs prefer the term “adult nonalcoholic cocktails.”

At Tiki Tom’s, Crider recently revamped the drinks menu—adding new mocktail selections such as the Grass Skirt (a lemongrass sparkling lemonade) and the Manakō-ko (a mango beverage that is reminiscent of a mojito)—and prioritizes sophisticated flavors over sweetness with her libations.

“A lot of people … think mocktails will be juice-y, syrupy concoctions. I want our customers to get a well-balanced drink that feels like a cocktail [but isn’t] a sugar bomb,” she says. “If someone doesn’t want to drink, but is OK with traces of alcohol, I have a wide variety of bitters that can add great complexity in a mocktail.”

A curated selection of nonalcoholic drinks is also on the menu at the Black Cat, an intimate restaurant featuring small plates, natural wines, and craft cocktails that opened in downtown Livermore in June.

“We love our community and want everyone to feel as comfortable as possible when they are dining or drinking with us,” says co-owner Dina Parks. “It’s important to have those NA options and offer people drinks that are beautiful and made with love.”

Parks developed the Black Cat’s NA beverages, including the Blackberry Sage Smash, a refreshing drink with muddled sage and blackberries, lemon juice, and house-made simple syrup, topped with Topo Chico mineral water and a fresh blackberry. “I love to see the delighted expression on people’s faces when it hits the table,” says Parks. “They aren’t expecting to see such a beautiful drink.”

Even more traditional spots such as SideTrack Bar and Grill, which has been in operation in Pleasanton since 2018, are getting in on the action. Owner Todd Utikal says he added nonalcoholic drink options such as the Not So Prickly Pear Margarita and Tonic Therapy last fall after noticing surges in lighter drinking habits in November and dry January.

“We have four NA drinks we make ourselves, and they are all really good,” says Utikal. “We [built] off our signature drinks and took out the alcohol, replacing it with soda or tonic.”

SideTrack’s drink selection includes a NA beer from Athletic Brewing Co. that Utikal says sells very well—so well he is now introducing another nonalcoholic beer, Heineken 0.0.

“We are absolutely seeing an increase in NA requests, and I love that we’re on top of it,” he adds.

Regardless of what’s officially on the cocktail list, customers can always ask a bartender to make an alcohol-free drink on the spot. “At the end of the day, I just want everyone to be able to take part and feel welcome,” says Crider. “If you come to Tiki Tom’s, there will be something to choose from on our menu, or we can whip something up that will suit your needs.”

## MAKING MOCKTAILS AT HOME

Lila Volkas, an Oakland-based certified nutrition consultant, has been teaching food and beverage workshops since 2013, with a focus on the nonalcoholic space.

“I feel very passionate about normalizing nonalcoholic options,” says Volkas, who went through a health journey several years ago that included cutting out alcohol. “My mocktail mixology class has been my No. 1 booked class for the past two years. … People are trying to get healthier, trying to exercise more and feel better. Reducing alcohol is definitely part of that.”

She hosts mocktail mixology workshops for corporate clients, as well as in-person and virtual classes for the public, and makes her own recipes with a focus on ingredients that are available in most kitchens.

“A mocktail should have all the elements that people look for in [an alcoholic] cocktail including balance, complexity, bite, and aesthetics,” says Volkas. “I like integrating herbs and spices for that functional aspect. I am looking to create an intense flavor. A simple drink won’t hit that same feel as drinking a cocktail. Alcohol is intense; there is a burn when you drink it.”

She utilizes tea for its variety of flavors and caffeinating effects, as well as NA spirits. And, of course, the beverage presentation is critical.

“Nice glassware always elevates the drink, as does using different rims like sugar or salt. I am a big fan of citrus peels and zest,” adds Volkas. “I like syrups, extracts, and using olive brine or pickle juice. When you don’t use alcohol, you need to come up with interesting ingredients.”

For people looking to stock their own nonalcoholic bar at home, Alkali Rye’s Moncada Konte calls out several of the store’s top sellers such as Namari, a small-batch NA spirit produced in Ojai, California; Good Twin’s prosecco; and Ghia, which has a wide range of products including canned beverages and an aperitif that can be used as a mixer or drunk straight.

“Abstinence Spirits has a bitter blood orange aperitivo spritz; it will feel a lot like a Campari and soda, a classic that is good for all occasions,” she adds.

Moncada Konte also recommends keeping a quality club soda on hand (“something with a strong hard bubble”) and a selection of NA beers.

## MINDFUL DRINKING

Trendy terms such as “sober curiosity” and “mindful consumption” reflect new ways of thinking about alcohol. In January, more than 1,500 attendees gathered in Washington, D.C., for Mindful Drinking Fest, a three-day event that fosters connection and focuses on education around low- or no-alcohol beverages. “There were 100 vendors in the tasting hall and so many new brands coming out. The sheer energy was amazing,” says Rachel Radcliffe, who attended Mindful Drinking Fest and is the founder of East Bay Sober Socialites.

In 2022, Radcliffe began the social group with the hope of finding other people interested in communal, alcohol-free activities such as hiking, crafting, and playing board games. “I don’t come from a recovery or addiction background. I just don’t feel good when I drink, and I don’t like it. I have always tried to find as many alternatives as I could,” Radcliffe says. “A lot of people came [to the Sober Socialites gatherings] who were tired of seeing events that revolved around drinking. They really appreciated that my focus was on fun activities and mocktails or nonalcoholic options. They could feel safe when they came, as there was no pressure or expectation to drink.”

With 360 current members from Oakland, Alameda, Dublin, and various other East Bay cities, Sober Socialites now has a wellness education slant with weekly events ranging from yoga to art therapy to mindful movement. Radcliffe also enjoys sharing NA and functional drink discoveries with the group.

“I love the idea of all these alternatives. Some are mood-enhancing like kava and THC drinks. Some [have] health benefits or adaptogens—drinks that not only taste great but also have beneficial properties such as [beverages with] ginseng or holy basil,” Radcliffe says. "Yes, you can find an NA wine or beer, but [that’s not] what the younger generation is drinking. They don’t like the taste of alcohol to begin with.”

#### FOR THE OENOPHILES

**Local wineries offer customers a variety of low-ABV beverages.**

_By Emilie White_

If your tastes lean more toward wine than spirits, Livermore Valley winemakers provide several choices to please a low-alcohol palate. Low-ABV wines—which usually hover around 5.5 to 9.5 percent alcohol—can be produced by removing alcohol from existing wines, using varietals with less sugar to be fermented into alcohol, or altering the fermentation process.

At Las Positas Vineyards, vintner Brent Amos presents two alternatives—Lean wines, which include red and white blends and a rosé at 7 percent ABV, and the Minima white and red blends at .5 percent ABV. The Minima blends are dealcoholized, while the Leans are created by blending Minimas with regular wines for reduced alcohol content. “Whether [someone has] a temporary [medical] condition or [people] simply can’t have alcohol, those are a good option if they’re used to having their glass of wine every night or they want to fit into a social setting,” says Amos.

Fans of 3 Steves Winery can try the 5.9-percent-ABV Coops Piquette. The lightly fizzy drink, served in cans, is part of a tradition with roots in ancient Rome. “At the end of my fermentation process for my red wine, we re-collect dried grape skins [and] ferment again in water,” says winemaker Alexander Wolfe, comparing the result to a “wine White Claw.” “It’s a nice way to get a dual use out of our grapes. … We want to have something for everybody.”
