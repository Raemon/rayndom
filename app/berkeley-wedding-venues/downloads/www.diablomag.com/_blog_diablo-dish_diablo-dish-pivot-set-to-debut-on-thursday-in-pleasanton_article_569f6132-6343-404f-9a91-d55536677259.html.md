### Pivot Craft Kitchen and Sports Bar to Launch Thursday in Pleasanton

**Francis X. Hogan** ’s latest Tri-Valley project is at last set to launch. The chef-owner behind Sabio on Main and Crush’d Wine Bar and Kitchen will debut [**Pivot Craft Kitchen and Sports Bar**](https://www.pivotpleasanton.com) this Thursday at 5121 Hopyard Road by the Four Points by Sheraton Pleasanton hotel. Launching just in time for the NFL playoffs and the upcoming winter Olympics, the upscale sports bar concept offers two stories and around 12,000 square feet of sports viewing fun that will eventually include a whopping 40-plus flat screens, two Topgolf simulator suites, and three private luxury suites modeled on those at the Chase Center that accommodate up to 18 people each. (The website even has a “[TV Guide](https://www.pivotpleasanton.com/tv-guide-1)” section listing which sporting events can be seen each day.) For now, Hogan says, they will be opening just the bar area—which accommodates more than 80 guests—with the dining room and suites set to roll out in mid-February. Similarly, Pivot will offer a more limited menu to start that includes scratch-made apps such as hand-breaded mozzarella sticks, pork belly nachos, and deviled eggs with salmon and trout roe, in addition to soups, salads, sandwiches, and signature two-day chicken wings served with homemade sauces. More labor-intensive dishes such as handmade chicken nuggets and fresh-baked lye pretzels, as well as steaks and chops cooked on the kitchen’s custom wood-burning grill, will also be introduced in mid-February. For Hogan, it’s been a long journey filled with construction and permitting delays, but with a launch in sight, he says the team is “incredibly excited to finally swing the doors open.”

### Ruby Lou’s and Dish N Dash Updates

And we have a bit of news on two other inclusions in _Dish_ ’s list of [most anticipated restaurant openings](https://www.diablomag.com/blog/diablo-dish/diablo-dish-most-anticipated-east-bay-restaurants-in-2026-part-1/article_df520a10-b9f8-449d-a8ce-35cf3f8290fe.html) of 2026. Per her [Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/p/DTKPXwiliAY/), **Megan Benshalom** announced that her colorful, maximalist **Ruby Lou’s Boujee Bites and Games** had passed its final health inspection and would likely be debuting to the public soon (it’s currently open for private events). Functioning as a family-friendly haven full of hands-on games and activities by day and a cocktail bar by night, Ruby Lou’s is located in the former Buon Vino wine bar space just off North Main Street in downtown Walnut Creek. And popular South Bay Middle Eastern destination [**Dish N Dash**](https://www.dishdash.com) will likely be launching its first East Bay presence in a matter of months. The fast-casual concept from husband-wife team **Emad Ibrahim** and **Nadiah Mshasha** has grown to several South Bay locations with its menu of Middle Eastern staples that includes hummus, falafel, pita bread, and other items that are scratch-made daily via a centralized kitchen. According to Mshasha, the couple’s 5,400-square-foot new Dublin restaurant should be open in the former Applebee’s Grill and Bar spot in the Hacienda Crossings shopping center between March and April.

### Draeger’s to Close Permanently in Blackhawk

Sad news for Danville foodies, as upscale grocery shop [**Draeger’s**](https://www.draegers.com) announced that it would be closing its longtime location in Blackhawk Plaza. According to reports, the move has less to do with prevailing economics than with the progressive decline in the once-thriving shopping center. In an interview with the _East Bay Times,_ co-owner **Richard Draeger** cited the high vacancy rate at Blackhawk Plaza—which lost anchor tenants the Grille at Blackhawk and Century Theaters in recent years—for declining foot traffic, in addition to poor property maintenance by the center’s current ownership group. He said that both of Draeger’s Peninsula locations in Menlo Park and Los Altos continue to do strong business and would remain open. The 18-year-old Danville location is in the process of clearing inventory via closing sales and will likely shutter permanently sometime in February.

### Mac’s Old House to Reopen This Summer

We totally missed this—blame the holidays—but affordable prime rib haven **Mac’s Old House** will be reopening under new ownership likely by this summer. Mac’s previous owners shuttered the longtime institution housed inside a 100-year-old house in Antioch last summer, much to the dismay of fans of its old-school vibe and Italian family-style meals at throwback prices ($17.95 prime rib dinners!). However, Mac’s [announced](https://www.instagram.com/p/DRyUybREWKm/?hl=en) last month that friends and construction industry veterans **Joe Martinez** and **Ron Harrison** had purchased the property and would be undergoing work to bring the building back up to code with the goal of reopening in June. Former head chef and manager Rick Cook is aiding with the transition, which would include passing along all of Mac’s original recipes. According to [a report](https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/12/18/macs-old-house-in-antioch-to-reopen-in-2026/), once renovations are complete, Martinez and Harrison will transfer operations over to a local family with experience in running restaurants—and who have plans to open for lunch service in addition to dinner.

### Small Bites From Around the East Bay

Oakland Burmese destination **Teni East Kitchen** is [moving](https://www.sfchronicle.com/food/restaurants/article/teni-east-kitchen-burmese-oakland-21277381.php) into a larger new space at 3770 Piedmont Avenue previously occupied by Pomella.

**Brioche de Paris** bakery is [now open](https://bayareatelegraph.com/2026/01/13/lafayettes-brand-new-bakery-is-officially-open/) in downtown Lafayette.

Former downtown Walnut Creek restaurateur and longtime Bay Area chef **Valentino Luchin** was officially [indicted](https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/san-francisco-chef-indicted-rob-banks-21289074.php) on charges of attempting to rob three San Francisco banks in one day last September. Luchin opened and ran the popular Venetian-style osteria Ottavio for six years until closing in 2016 due to financial struggles.

Some [more love](https://www.sfchronicle.com/food/restaurants/article/chubby-cattle-bbq-pleasanton-21253028.php) for Pleasanton’s hit all-you-can-eat Wagyu restaurant **Chubby Cattle.**

For the ski bums and bunnies out there: James Beard–winning San Francisco chef **Traci Des Jardins** [debuted](https://www.sfgate.com/food/article/award-winning-sf-chef-helms-new-restaurant-tahoe-21278163.php) a new restaurant at Sugar Bowl Resort.

San Ramon is now home to a 24-hour [Mexican fast food chain](https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2026/01/07/east-bay-new-all-day-mexican-restaurant/) (and it’s not Taco Bell).
