_Why can’t my child sit still for more than five minutes? Why does my teen continually forget to turn in her schoolwork? Why is it so hard for me to accomplish a work assignment without getting distracted?_

For many people—and their families—who are living with undiagnosed attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), not knowing is often the hardest part. Clayton residents Giles Thompson and Kita Kopfelt-Thompson were well-versed in the signs and symptoms of ADHD, as their oldest son has the neurodevelopmental disorder, so they were on the lookout with their younger son, Jessie.

“Our older son was so frustrated before we realized what was happening. He would run out of class, break pencils; he just had a horrible time,” recalls Thompson.

However, Jessie’s ADHD presented differently, though he did have hyperactivity as well as some speech delays. His academic challenges were highlighted by distance learning during the COVID pandemic, and he was diagnosed with ADHD when he was 10. Now 15 and under the care of developmental-behavioral pediatrician Lawrence Diller, M.D., Jessie is managing his condition with the help of medication, study strategies, accommodations at school (he has an individualized education program, or IEP), and plenty of communication with his family.

“We talk with Jessie about how he feels on medication, so he can try and find that [calm] when he isn’t on the meds,” says Kopfelt-Thompson. “We do a lot of mental therapy like that.”

“Jessie is included in every conversation we have about his ADHD and his meds,” adds his father. “We ask if [medication] helps, and if he were to say no, we would look for another way.”

An avid equestrian, Jessie says he has an easier time focusing on physical activities such as horseback riding, but his daily dose of Concerta (a stimulant medication used to treat ADHD) helps his schoolwork. “I feel a difference when I take my meds,” he says. “I can think about something for a lot longer and not have my brain wander off.”

Diller has been treating patients with ADHD in the Walnut Creek area for more than 40 years. “I wrote my first Ritalin prescription in 1980,” he says of the common ADHD medication. He recommends a management program that is balanced between medication and non-drug interventions. “The main proven [non-medication] interventions are parenting and behavioral strategies at home and at school,” says Diller.

### The ABCs of ADHD

There are three types of ADHD, per the American Psychiatric Association’s _Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders_ (DSM): predominantly hyperactive-impulsive presentation, predominantly inattentive presentation, and a combined presentation of the two. ADHD is one of the most common mental disorders affecting children, and symptoms usually become apparent before age 12.

##### —Pam Orren, Ph.D.

Kaiser Permanente Walnut Creek Medical Center psychologist Pam Orren, Ph.D., says boys tend to fall in the predominantly hyperactive-impulsive presentation, while girls are more consistently predominantly inattentive. In general, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there is a greater number of males with ADHD: 15 percent of boys are more likely to be diagnosed with ADHD compared to 8 percent of girls. Gender stereotypes may impact diagnosis rates.

Diagnosing ADHD can take several steps, and other issues, including learning or processing difficulties, may be factors. Parents should start by talking to their pediatrician, who might ask about the child’s behavior in multiple settings such as school and home. Symptoms vary by ADHD type and may include fidgeting, inability to sit still or listen, talking too much, interrupting, lacking attention, poor organization, forgetfulness, and impulsivity, among others. The DSM requires the presence of at least six symptoms occurring for at least six months for an ADHD diagnosis in children up to 16.

### An Expanding Public Health Concern

Last May, the CDC issued a report detailing the rise in diagnoses of ADHD among children and adolescents in the United States—calling ADHD an “expanding public health concern.” The report revealed that 7.1 million children and adolescents were diagnosed with ADHD in 2022, up approximately a million since 2016. Researchers suggested a correlation between that increase and growing awareness of ADHD, along with a surge in post-pandemic mental health assessments for kids.

Orren has certainly seen a greater incidence of ADHD among her patients, particularly in children and adolescents, but also in older groups.

“I think the [first] reason for the increase of diagnoses is increased awareness,” says Orren. “Second, coming out of the pandemic and distance learning, we saw a lot of kids really struggle with attention and concentration. As they transitioned back to [school], those struggles are continuing in the classroom. The third reason is global and systemic, and that is an increase in technology and social media [use].”

The prevalence of smartphones and other digital distractions, along with an improved understanding of ADHD, may also be behind the growing number of adults who have been diagnosed with the condition.

#### "People are [also] struggling to manage everything in their jobs and their lives and think that [having] ADHD might explain why they are struggling.­"­

##### —Martin Diller, clinical psychotherapist

Martin Diller, a clinical psychotherapist who works with his father at their Walnut Creek practice, cites the intense pressure on adults in the U.S. as being one factor. “With the addition of technology and the speed of information, demands on adults to perform at almost all hours of the day have increased,” he says. “It is more acceptable to seek treatment [now] as an adult, but people are [also] struggling to manage everything in their jobs and their lives and think that [having] ADHD might explain why they are struggling.”

“Our work life now is a recipe for ADHD,” Orren concurs. “Everything is screen-based all the time. ... Humans need to be social and engaged. ... It’s really hard for people to stay engaged in what they are doing and concentrate on a screen all day long.”

### Treating and Managing ADHD

When it comes to treating children 11 and under for ADHD, Lawrence Diller says he prefers to hold off on medication initially and try behavioral interventions at home, ones that are focused less on talk and more on action (such as a break or time-out in response to poor behavior). “The interventions need to be geared toward an immediacy of consequences,” he says. Educational approaches such as screening for learning or processing problems are also important and may even lead to a diagnosis that is not ADHD. Both Diller and Orren encourage parents to know their rights when it comes to IEPs or 504 plans that can help with accommodations in schools. Says Orren, “[Such support] is a critical element to [kids’] educational success.”

For parents who would prefer to avoid medication for their kids, Orren suggests behavioral training to improve executive functioning and working on delayed gratification techniques, especially for those with milder ADHD symptoms. She also encourages a nutritious diet that is low in processed sugar and cites the critical need for a good night’s sleep.

“One thing that can be helpful for [anyone] with ADHD, children and adults, is physical exercise. It can manage some of their hyperactivity and inattention,” adds Orren.

Martin Diller says mindfulness and meditation can be beneficial as well, especially for adults: “[Such practices can get] people to slow down, ground themselves, and be more effective at problem-solving.”

Adults who use stimulant drugs for their ADHD should involve their spouse or another loved one to support their treatment and proper medication management.

Dealing with ADHD may get easier with time and experience. Joseph, a 22-year-old Oakland resident and aspiring pilot who has seen Lawrence Diller for 10 years, urges people not to focus on the limitations of the disorder. “When you think of [people with] ADHD, you may just think of kids who aren’t listening in class,” he says. “Much of that behavior comes from the immaturity inherent in children, and they have a harder time controlling it. When they grow up, they will be as mature as people without ADHD.”

Orren encourages those fearful about an ADHD diagnosis to take heart. “We have great treatments, both pharmacological and non-pharmacological, for ADHD. It is something that is likely to impact patients for their lifespan, but it is manageable.”
