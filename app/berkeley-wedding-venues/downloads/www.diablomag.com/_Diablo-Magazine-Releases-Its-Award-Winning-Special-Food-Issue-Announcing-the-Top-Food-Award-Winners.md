October 30, 2014

**Judged by well-known food writers, Diablo food editors, and input from readers, this year’s November edition highlights four top editors’ picks and seven readers’ winners.**

Walnut Creek, CA -Diablo Publications has released its award-winning special food issue, which highlights its 2014 Food Award winners in San Francisco East Bay communities. Judged by well-known food writers, Diablo food editors, and with input from readers, this year’s November edition highlights four award-winning restaurants that have set new standards in dining experiences. Additionally the "In Your Words" section highlights seven readers’ picks that are noted as dream-worthy restaurants.

The four award-winning restaurants are Sunol Ridge, Walnut Creek; Revel, Danville; The Cooperage, Lafayette; and China Lounge, Pleasanton. The seven readers’ dream-worthy winners are: Best Place to Go on a Rainy Night: The Peasant and the Pear, Danville; Best Place to See and Be Seen: Bridges, Danville; Best Place to Go for My Last Night on Earth: Esin, Danville; Best Place to Go if You Win the Lottery: Chez Panisse, Berkeley; Best Place to Go With a Long-Lost Friend: Gianni’s, San Ramon; Best Place to Go After a Shopping Spree: Va de Vi, Walnut Creek; and Best Place to Take Anthony Bourdain: Artisan Bistro, Lafayette.

Diablo magazine’s annual food issue also has a companion event, Gourmet East Bay, which brings the November issue to life by featuring many of the award-winning restaurants mentioned. Gourmet East Bay is presented by Diablo magazine and Broadway Plaza, and sponsored by BiRite Foodservice Distributors. Gourmet East Bay will have 20 of the top restaurants from the area, featuring premier tastings; wineries from Livermore, Napa, and New Zealand; as well as spirits tastings from Maker’s Mark. There will also be an exclusive raffle with proceeds supporting event beneficiary Food Bank of Contra Costa and Solano. The event will take place at Broadway Plaza on November 1, 2014.

"November is one of our most anticipated issues of the year," states Barney Fonzi, Group Publisher for Diablo Publications. "Diablo magazine’s signature event, Gourmet East Bay, offers our partners the opportunity to directly connect with our reader, while also supporting an important charity."
