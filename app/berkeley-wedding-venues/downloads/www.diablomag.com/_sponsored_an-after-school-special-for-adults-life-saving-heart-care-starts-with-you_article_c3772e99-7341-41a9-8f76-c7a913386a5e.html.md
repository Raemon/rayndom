![SRM-CARD-Heart-Month-26-DIG-SOC-1080x1080-2026_06.jpg](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAQAAAADCAQAAAAe/WZNAAAAEElEQVR42mM8U88ABowYDABAxQPltt5zqAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)

At 49, Danville resident John Granados considered himself healthy and active. Working out on the elliptical three to five times a week was routine—until suddenly it wasn’t. During two separate workouts, Granados found himself unable to get past ten minutes. Each time, he stepped off the machine with numbness in his left arm and an ache in his jaw. The symptoms disappeared quickly, and amid a period of intense stress at work, he dismissed them.

“I kept thinking, ‘Is this a heart attack?’” Granados recalled. “But then the symptoms went away, so I told myself it was probably anxiety or a panic attack.”

A month later, during his annual physical, Granados mentioned the episodes almost in passing. He was quick to downplay them, but his physician was not convinced. An EKG produced inconclusive results, yet raised enough concern that, after consultation with a cardiologist, Granados was sent to the Emergency Room at San Ramon Regional Medical Center for further testing.

Even then, he resisted. With meetings on his calendar, Granados asked if the testing could wait. It didn’t take much convincing, however, and he stayed. Additional EKGs and a treadmill stress test again produced unclear results. When an opening became available for an angiogram, doctors explained three possible outcomes—ranging from no findings to immediate intervention.

The results led to the most serious conclusion. Granados had a 100 percent blockage in his left anterior descending artery—often called the “widow maker”—and a 95 percent blockage in another artery. He was admitted overnight, stunned by the news. While the diagnosis was shocking, there was a critical silver lining: he had not yet experienced a cardiac event, allowing time for thorough pre-operative testing and preparation for a scheduled procedure.

A few days before the procedure, Granados was hit in the side by a line drive while playing baseball with his son. Because he was on blood thinners, the injury looked alarming and raised concerns. To be safe, the care team ordered a CT scan the evening before surgery. The scan was clear.

“I don’t know if other hospitals can coordinate their expertise as quickly as San Ramon Regional,” Granados said, “but it sure gave me confidence going into surgery.”

That sense of reassurance was reinforced as he was wheeled into the operating room. Anxious, Granados mentioned to a nurse and anesthesiologist that he used to sing “Take Me Out to the Ball Game” to his children. The anesthesiologist pulled out his phone and played the song.

“That’s not in any procedure guide,” Granados said. “That was just a gesture of care. That’s been my experience at San Ramon Regional.”

The double coronary artery bypass surgery was successful. Granados spent four days in the ICU, where early movement was encouraged. Despite discomfort, he was walking laps, climbing stairs with physical and occupational therapists, and steadily regaining strength. After discharge, home visits from nurses and therapists provided both physical support and peace of mind.

Now a participant in cardiac rehabilitation at San Ramon Regional Medical Center, Granados continues to rebuild endurance in a monitored, supportive environment. Reflecting on his experience, he hopes others take symptoms seriously—even when they seem fleeting.

“This is like my After School Special,” he said. “If the lesson motivates even one person not to ignore what their body is telling them, then it’s worth sharing.”
