![2024.12-GHF-Courtyard-Rendering.jpg](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAQAAAADCAQAAAAe/WZNAAAAEElEQVR42mM8U88ABowYDABAxQPltt5zqAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)

By now, most East Bay retirees have heard about The Glen at Heather Farm, a brand new retirement community under construction on thirty acres in Walnut Creek. While the community is still a couple of years away from opening, thousands of local seniors have acted to preserve the option to reserve a home in the new community as they become available.

* * *

#### THE RIGHT MIX—IN JUST THE RIGHT PLACE

As a comprehensive Life Plan community, Heather Farm will be unlike any other retirement living option available in Walnut Creek today. Designed and built by the same team that brought the award-winning Stoneridge Creek community to Pleasanton, the Heather Farm is just blocks from John Muir medical center off Ygnacio. Opening in a single construction phase, the neighborhood includes a diverse selection of quality housing options, from modest apartments to large, single story homes, connected by comfortable walking paths with beautiful views of Mt. Diablo and Briones Regional Park.

Residents of the new community will enjoy a portfolio of convenient amenities and services designed to make life more enjoyable and comfortable. Because restaurant dining, fitness spas, theaters and more are included—and located just steps from their front porch and those of their friends, enjoying the best parts of life gets easier.

The defining characteristic of a real Life Plan community is a real plan for long term care. Because our 70s and 80s can be unpredictable, it can be tempting to avoid talking about the realities of aging and the challenges they can present for us and those who care about us the most. The Glen at Heather Farm provides a truly comprehensive, on-site solution to long-term care concerns for its residents in the event they need additional services as they age—providing true piece of mind for them and their families.

* * *

#### TAKE THE TIME TO EDUCATE YOURSELF

Now, an advertisement is just that—but it never hurts to get the facts straight from the source. If you want to become really informed about the details of the new community before all the available homes are reserved, you can make an appointment to stop by an information center just down the street from Heather Farm. There, you can view a scale model and get details that you can take home and peruse at your leisure.

Simply call (866) 711-0885 to set up a convenient time or visit [heatherfarm.com](http://www.heatherfarm.com).
