### Square Pie Guys Sets an Opening Date

Popular Detroit-style pizza outfit [**Square Pie Guys**](https://www.squarepieguys.com) is debuting its first Contra Costa County location this Sunday, January 11, in Walnut Creek. Located at the bottom of the Waymark apartment complex by the Walnut Creek BART station, the San Francisco–based chain’s sixth location will offer a full lineup of salads, wings, sides, and signature crispy cheddar-cheese-crusted square pizzas. It will also include a new pie inspired by an artist collaboration with **P-Lo**. Inspired by the Bay Area rapper’s Filipino upbringing and heritage, the P-Lo Pie is topped with rich vodka sauce, red onions, _longanisa_ and Italian sausage, and hot honey bomba, before being finished with spicy ranch and fresh basil. A portion of the proceeds from each pie sold will support nonprofit United Playaz, dedicated to youth empowerment, mentorship, and violence prevention in the Bay Area.

### Tokyo Central Reveals More Details Ahead of Grand Opening

**Tokyo Central Specialty Market** released [additional details](https://tokyocentral.com/emeryville-grand-opening) on its big new location set to open later this month as an anchor tenant at Emeryville’s Bay Street mall. The much-anticipated new Japanese grocery store had teased that it would include a stand-alone restaurant within its 40,000-square-foot interior and revealed its identity: **Hand Roll Factory**. The roughly 1,600-square-foot restaurant will serves à la carte hand rolls made with warm Hitomebore rice, freshly-toasted Ariake seaweed, special vinegar and soy sauce blends, hand-grated wasabi, and fresh fish such as premium bluefin tuna (in addition to preparing to-go chirashi sushi). The store will also make in-house fresh sushi and warm grab-n-go bento boxes for lunch, in addition to a large selection of seafood, meat, fruits, and vegetables, and other imported Japanese snacks, sweets, seasonings, teas, alcohol, and home and beauty products. Tokyo Central’s grand opening will take place the weekend of January 31 and February 1 and include dance performances, gift certificate and prize giveaways, and special opening weekend sales.

### Oyo Owner Bringing British-Style Restaurant to Downtown Pleasanton

If you missed our end-of-year list of most anticipated new restaurants coming to the East Bay in 2026, _Dish_ broke the news that Oyo chef-owner **Maurice Dissels** is taking over the nearby Gilman Brewing Company space at 725 Main Street in downtown Pleasanton. Dissels plans to remake the taproom into a British-style pub called **Union Jack Lounge and Kitchen**. The concept both pays homage to the popular Union Jack watering hole that closed downtown 20 years ago and reflects Dissels’ own background growing up in British Guiana. Expected to open in the next few months, Union Jack will offer fresh spins on traditional British pub fare—including fish and chips and bangers and mash—along with signature cocktails, beer, and wine. Of paramount importance for Dissels, however, is to maintain the neighborhood-focused, egalitarian spirit of the old Union Jack at his new project.

“We want to keep it affordable and approachable—keep it as a community spot that serves as a welcome neighborhood destination,” he says. “Because at the end of the day, our Union Jack will be a place for the locals, many of whom spent a great deal of time at the old Union Jack pub.”

### Iconic Italian Deli Genova Closes Walnut Creek Store

**Genova Delicatessen** , an Italian sandwich destination with East Bay roots that go back a century, has closed another location in Walnut Creek. Known for its large made-to-order sandwiches with imported Italian meats on a roll of your choice, Genova closed its store in the Countrywood Shopping Center in November according to several reports. The family-run chain shut its original location in Oakland’s Temescal district back in 2016, much to the dismay of longtime local sandwich aficionados. Fortunately, Genova’s other Walnut Creek shop on South California Boulevard is still open, as is another location in Napa.

### Espetus Opens in Concord

**Espetus Brazilian Steak House** , a longtime Brazilian steakhouse fixture in San Francisco, launched a [soft opening](https://www.instagram.com/p/DS8cRNCEoPu/) for its first East Bay location over the Christmas holidays. Promising a traditional “churrascaria” all-you-can-eat experience, in which 14 different cuts of charcoal-fired pork, steak, chicken, shrimp, and lamb are carved tableside and served with side dishes offered from the ample buffet table, it takes over the location of another Brazilian steak house, Texas de Brazil, at Concord’s Veranda shopping center. This will be the third location for Espetus, which debuted in San Francisco in 2003 and launched a second location in San Mateo in 2008. Look for grand opening details on their Instagram page.

### Middle 8 to Shutter in Downtown Pleasanton

Alas, as one door opens, another closes. Longtime local bar maven **Rick Dobbs** [announced](https://www.instagram.com/p/DTB2xVTEx-u/) that he was shuttering his popular downtown Pleasanton bar and cocktail lounge **Middle 8** after this weekend—for now. In his announcement via social media, Dobbs cited a large rent hike and an increase in overall costs as reasons for the sudden closure. However, he said he hopes to “quickly move to a new location!” Middle 8’s last day of service in its current home will be Sunday, January 11.

### The Dive Opens in Former Spoontonic Space

And as one door closes, another opens. [**The Dive**](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61585460184381) debuted just after Christmas at 2580 North Main Street, the longtime home of another locally legendary dive bar, Spoontonic Lounge. Describing itself on Facebook as a “laid-back neighborhood spot serving good drinks in a comfortable, welcoming space,” owners have given the space a sleek, speakeasy-style makeover complete with signature cocktails that include a Canadian old-fashioned with Crown Royal whiskey and maple syrup. The Dive is currently open nightly from 4 p.m. to midnight.

### Small Bites From Around the East Bay

Recent [zoning changes](https://www.sfgate.com/food/article/my-bay-area-neighborhood-is-ghost-town-21219076.php) may provide momentum for filling some of the vacant storefronts (ideally with a grocery store) in Oakland’s lovely but perpetually struggling **Jack London Square.**

**Gusto Mio Focacceria and Pizzeria** ’s focaccia sandwiches and **Chubby Cattle** ’s Japanese A5 Wagyu beef earn mentions in a [list](https://www.sfgate.com/food/article/best-bay-area-restaurant-dishes-2025-21248800.php) of best Bay Area bites of 2025.

A fascinating [article](https://www.sfchronicle.com/food/restaurants/article/ohgane-korean-food-restaurant-21209722.php) profiling **Micha Oh** , the “godmother” of Korean cuisine in the Bay Area and a guiding force behind several new Korean concepts in the East Bay.

The **Lafayette Park Hotel and Spa** [brings in](https://bayareatelegraph.com/2026/01/02/lafayette-park-hotels-restaurant-is-getting-a-new-executive-chef-with-strong-concord-ties/) a pedigreed East Bay chef to run its food program: **John Marquez** , previous chef-owner of Lima in Concord and, before that, perennial _Diablo_ Food Award winner Artisan Bistro in Lafayette.

Celebrated cupcakery **Sprinkles** suddenly [shuttered](https://apnews.com/article/sprinkles-cupcake-closure-325756b3354fa82ce3c3693f76dd78e8) all U.S. operations, including its store in San Ramon’s City Center Bishop Ranch.

Pork _katsu_ specialist **Jungdon Katsu** —which was forced to close its Danville outpost after a fire last year—gets a nice [shout-out](https://www.sfchronicle.com/food/restaurants/article/jungdon-katsu-pork-emeryville-21252903.php) for its new Emeryville restaurant.

We covered some of this in [_Diablo_](https://www.diablomag.com/food-drink/beer-garden-boom-in-the-east-bay/article_2adf71fd-e0b8-40f2-bda1-4d6c566d6fcd.html) , but the _San Francisco Chronicle’s_ wine critic [dives into](https://www.sfchronicle.com/food/wine/article/brewery-taproom-craft-beer-21164202.php) how local breweries—many of them in the East Bay—have thrived despite a wider national decline in craft beer sales. Hint: The key is creating community-driven gathering spaces in which beer is just one part of the equation.
