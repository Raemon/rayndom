The 22nd annual [California Independent Film Festival](http://caiff.org) runs August 28-29 at the Orinda Theatre and August 31 at the Castro Theatre in San Francisco.

This acclaimed festival is a great way to see expertly curated international features and shorts—the kind of movies that are difficult to find in the age of superhero franchises.

The festival was created by East Bay residents Derek Zemrak and Leonard Pirkle. For information about films and showtimes, go to [caiff.org](http://caiff.org).

Dukla 61

Director: David Ondříček

Producers: Michal Reitler

Drama/History, Czech Republic

150 mins

Centered on a mining disaster that took the lives of 108 men on July 7, 1961, Dukla 61 is an expansive, emotionally resonant portrait of a family. When Petr brings home his pregnant girlfriend Jana, declaring that he will abandon his college studies and become a miner like his father Milan, he dashes his parents’ hope for their son and plants seeds of discord that grow with the young couple’s live-in presence in a home crowded with younger children. This gripping two-part drama represents a masterwork for director Ondříček, with the pressures, worries, and intergenerational conflicts of family life ultimately intertwined and upstaged by the tense, chilling lead-up to the horror of the accident waiting to happen.

Surrogate father and son run away together on a rickety donkey cart in pursuit of Beshay’s dream to find the family that had long ago abandoned him at the gate of a leper colony. Acclaimed as the feel-good sensation of the 2018 Cannes Film Festival competition, this playful, poignant road movie traverses an Egypt that is light years away from the Arab Spring in its timeless view of villages, fertile fields, and the ever-present Nile, hardly more than a muddy creek. The remarkable odyssey of strange adventures, comic capers, and close calls expands on the "judgement day" meaning of its Arabic title, in a theme of acceptance and forgiveness. In Arabic with English subtitles.
