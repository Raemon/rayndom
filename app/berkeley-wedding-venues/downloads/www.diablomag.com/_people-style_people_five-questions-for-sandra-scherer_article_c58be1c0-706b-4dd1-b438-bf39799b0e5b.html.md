Monument Crisis Center got its start as a food pantry for at-risk families in 2003, but quickly became much more. Under the guidance of founding executive director Sandra Scherer, the Concord nonprofit has provided food, tutoring, school supplies, and other resources to thousands of people across Contra Costa County. In 2024, the center helped over 15,000 individuals, saw more than 38,100 visits to the food pantry, and distributed 66,700-plus bags of food. Scherer retired in April, leaving behind a legacy of support marked by mutual love, respect, and trust between the center and its clients.

#### “It’s really humbling to be around people who just want to make life better for themselves and their children. Then there are also our volunteers and supporters [who] do it all out of love. That’s what keeps you motivated to try and do more.”

##### —Sandra Scherer

* * *

#### Q: What can you share about the origins of Monument Crisis Center?

**A:** My first introduction to [the underserved aspects of the area] was through my daughter, who was in high school at the time. She was doing a diaper drive in the Monument Corridor and gave me information about the needs there. … People came in for food but [required] so much more. … The center just grew exponentially. It was a magical combination of people doing what they could to help their neighbor.

#### Q: What drove you over the years?

**A:** Seeing how hard people try, how difficult their situations are, and how much they want to get past them.

#### Q: Why did you choose to retire this year?

**A:** I went through a serious cancer in 2023. When I came back in 2024, I came back to a center that was so vibrant, so packed with activity and positivity. They had taken it to a whole new level. My target had always been to try and work until this age; it worked out nicely because we were ready. … [Now,] I’m spending time with my grandkids—enjoying a hot cup of coffee and being outside in my vegetable garden.

#### Q: How does it feel to turn the reins over to your son, Daniel, who is now the executive director?

**A:** He was a volunteer when we opened the center, as was my daughter; they did so much to help on every front. And then after he finished college, we pleaded with him to come join us for a year. That was 2011, and [since then] he’s held every position. We are one big family there, whether [people are] blood related or not.

#### Q: The Contra Costa County Board of Supervisors honored you earlier this year. What does that kind of recognition mean to you?

**A:** The most important thing is that they recognize the value of the Monument Crisis Center and the work that we do. The more people know about us, the more people who can help.
