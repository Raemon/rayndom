Young people indulge their imaginations at Walnut Creek’s Rebel Art School.

Alex Hollingshead

As the school year moves into full swing with students balancing academics, sports, and social outings, consider also scheduling time for creative expression. Not only do arts classes encourage the imagination, but they can also be a respite for busy minds.

“I often see a lot of kids exhausted and anxious from running from one activity to another on top of their homework load,” says Alex Hollingshead, founder of Rebel Art School in Walnut Creek. “Making art provides a much-needed mental break, a way to calm the body and the mind … that can also be exciting and stimulating.”

Painting, sculpting, and other outlets can boost problem-solving and critical-thinking skills, with studies linking regular art activities to academic achievements. “Creative classes provide space for self-expression, exploration into self-identity, building self-confidence, and processing emotions,” Hollingshead adds. “Art allows everyone to develop their own voice and ways of understanding the world around them.”

Young people indulge their imaginations at Walnut Creek’s Rebel Art School.

Alex Hollingshead

Rebel offers age-specific studio art classes (cohorts include kids 4 to 7, 8 to 11, and 12 to 17) that cover genres such as drawing, painting, printmaking, sculpture, mixed media collage, and textiles. An adjacent studio, Rebel Ceramics, provides hand-building classes using clay and advanced instruction that includes the use of a pottery wheel for older students. _[rebelartschool.com](http://rebelartschool.com)._ Children can also try wet clay classes at Kids ‘N’ Clay Pottery Studio in Berkeley. _[kidsnclay.com](http://kidsnclay.com)._

Other local arts classes include after-school kids and teen sessions through Livermore Valley Arts, educational offerings for kids at Pleasanton’s Firehouse Arts Center, and a range of options through Hayward Area Recreation and Park District. _[livermorearts.coursestorm​.com](http://livermorearts.coursestorm%E2%80%8B.com), [firehousearts.org](http://firehousearts.org), [hayward​rec.org](http://hayward%E2%80%8Brec.org)._ Younger learners will enjoy I Heart Art on Wednesdays at Pleasant Hill Library. The drop-in program has an option for toddlers made up of story time and an art project, as well as an after-school studio session that includes older kids. _[iheartartstudio.co](http://iheartartstudio.co)._

The Crucible—thought to be the largest nonprofit industrial arts education facility in the United States—is another (literal) hot spot for learning. In addition to fire arts such as blacksmithing and welding, the Oakland facility offers youth classes in media such as glassblowing, wood carving, jewelry making, and leatherworking (schedule pending for the fall). _[thecrucible.org](http://thecrucible.org)._ Young people might consider lessons at the Sewing Room in Alameda, including a one-day course on embroidery for teens and adults in October.  _[thesewingroomalameda.com](http://thesewingroomalameda.com)._

Along with hosting arts classes throughout the year, Walnut Creek Arts and Rec has a Make a Comic camp workshop at the end of November for ages 8 to 10. _[walnutcreekarts​rec.org](http://walnutcreekarts%E2%80%8Brec.org)._ Broadway lovers could sign up for a Playwriting class at I Can Do That! Performing Arts Center in Danville. _[icandothatpac.org](http://icandothatpac.org)._

Ballet lessons, such as those taught at the Ballet School Performing Arts in Walnut Creek (_[theballetschool.org](http://theballetschool.org)_), are always popular, but kids might also be interested in hula classes for children and teens at Aloha Studio in San Ramon. _[alohastudio​.net](http://alohastudio%E2%80%8B.net)._ Aspiring musicians can learn various instruments at School of Rock, which has locations around the East Bay. _[schoolofrock​.com](http://schoolofrock%E2%80%8B.com)._ Babies can take part in early music education with In Harmony Music, which recently started offering classes in Lafayette and Walnut Creek. _[inharmonymusic.com](http://inharmonymusic.com)._
