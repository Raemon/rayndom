When chef Kevin Weinberg and his partner, Ellen McCarty, opened Walnut Creek Yacht Club in May of 1997, it was an instant hit. Landlocked seafood fans appreciated ocean-fresh offerings like clam chowder and fish and chips, while everyone loved the breezy yacht club motif and convivial atmosphere. This spring, the duo decided to trim the sails and bring their beloved downtown destination back to shore, eliciting an outpouring of emotion from generations of loyal diners. Weinberg spoke with _Diablo_ about his nearly three decades spent anchoring the Walnut Creek restaurant scene.

#### “We’ve hosted celebrations of life; we’ve had people who ate here as kids come back with their kids. You don’t get that in other businesses. It’s humbling and rewarding.”

##### —Kevin Weinberg

#### Q: What was the reaction to your closure announcement?

**A:** We expected that we’d hear from lots of people, but we didn’t anticipate this much reaction and feedback. And we certainly didn’t expect it would make the news. Personally, it’s been hard: bittersweet, heartbreaking, but also heartwarming. I’ve definitely teared up.

#### Q: Why did you decide to close?

**A:** I think we were looking for a life with a lot less stress and a lot more freedom. Twenty-eight years is a long time in this business: It’s like 150 in human years. I was talking with friends about whether we could name another restaurant that’s been around for more than 25 years with the same menu, same owners, and same location. Nobody could.

#### Q: How did you initially come up with the concept for the restaurant?

**A:** My brother-in-law was in the fish business, so we settled on seafood. After culinary school, I traveled for 15 years opening restaurants, living in Australia, and sailing in the Caribbean. So I knew fish and boats and the yacht club life, and suddenly that was it: Walnut Creek Yacht Club. That led to the design and theme. [We wanted] people [to] feel like they were part of a club—that this was their place, and they could do their own thing. I remember when people first walked in after we opened; they thought they had to sign up to become an actual member. I was like, “Hey, you just walked in the door—you’re a member!”

#### Q: What’s it been like to be such a big part of Walnut Creek?

**A:** We’ve been able to help support so many different things in the local community. I’m proud of that. We’ve hosted celebrations of life; we’ve had people who ate here as kids come back with their kids. You don’t get that in other businesses. It’s humbling and rewarding.

#### Q: What will you miss most?

**A:** Our loyal guests and passionate staff, by far. None of this would have happened without them. ... I will miss cooking for people and seeing them enjoy the food and the experience. But maybe we can just have someone over for dinner.
