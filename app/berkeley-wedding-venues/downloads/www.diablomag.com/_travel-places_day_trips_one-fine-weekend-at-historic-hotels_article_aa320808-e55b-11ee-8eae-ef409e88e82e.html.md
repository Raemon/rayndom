Paddleboarding on Tomales Bay is one of the activities at Nick’s Cove.

Kristen Loken

Five recently spiffed-up historic hotels provide an extra incentive to get away this spring. Emerging from major renovations, these properties offer more than just a splendid spot to lay your head; they promise a history-rich sense of place that shiny new resorts can only dream about.

From seaside lodges and Victorian mansions to coastal cottages and structures in state parks, these intriguing Northern California lodgings are all within an easy drive of the East Bay.

* * *

### Nick’s Cove, Tomales Bay

What began as a small seafood shack selling shrimp and crab cocktails to tourists in the 1930s now features swoon-worthy waterfront accommodations. There are a dozen cottages in all at Nick’s Cove; five sit on the waterfront, while the rest boast water views.

The neighboring cottages now named Fly Fisherman’s and Uncle Andy’s were once the home of Nick’s Cove’s founders, Nick and Frances Kojich; the couple moved the one named Bandit’s Bungalow from their ranch on the west side of Tomales Bay to Nick’s Cove by barge. All the spaces exude charm and nautical nostalgia, thanks to enhancements including cozy new furnishings, refinished floors, custom rugs, and playful wallpaper.

The bar and restaurant got a contemporary glow up during the renovation as well, but on sunny days regulars still flock to tables on the dock to survey Tomales Bay while slurping oysters and munching on fish and chips.

#### While You’re There:

For a sophisticated night on the town, head into Petaluma (around a 30-minute drive) to visit an assortment of eateries, including **Central Market** and **Table Culture Provisions,** and peruse boutique shops like **Estuary. Barber Lee Spirits** and **Griffo Distillery** pour craft spirits and inventive cocktails.

Relax in rustic style at the Lodge at Marconi in West Marin.

Steven J. Magner

### Lodge at Marconi, Marshall

Even many West Marin residents don’t know about the transformation that’s taken place in the hillsides overlooking Tomales Bay. Located on 62 acres just off Highway 1, the Lodge at Marconi (formerly known as the Marconi Conference Center) opened in September after a multimillion-dollar renovation.

The lodge is tucked inside Marconi Conference Center State Historic Park. Originally home to native Coast Miwok, the land was used as a signal-receiving station by Guglielmo Marconi—the man credited as the inventor of radio—starting in 1912. Along with footprints of the once-massive 270-foot towers, a collection of his Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of America buildings remains.

In the 1960s, the property became a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center that evolved into the Church of Synanon and eventually a controversial cult. After the group disbanded amid allegations of violence, the philanthropic San Francisco Foundation purchased the land in 1980, paving the way for it to become a State Historic Park nearly a decade later.

Today, travelers will find 45 modernized rooms and suites, many of which offer views of Tomales Bay, but 3.5 miles of trails encourage folks to spend most of their time outside.

#### While You’re There:

Take a walking tour of **Point Reyes Farmstead Cheese Co.,** or reserve a tasting at **Heidrun Meadery** , where sparkling mead—wine made from honey instead of grapes—is created using the traditional French Méthode Champenoise. Tiny Point Reyes Station holds a surprising number of retail options, including **Toby’s Feed Barn,** **Sea to See** general store, and **Point Reyes Books.**

### Gosby House Inn and Green Gables Inn, Pacific Grove

Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, Gosby House Inn was originally built by Joseph F. Gosbey, the town’s first commercial cobbler. (The reason for the spelling discrepancy is unknown.) Gosbey realized the area was growing in popularity and began construction on the inn in 1887, expanding it as demand increased.

Now part of the Four Sisters collection, Gosby House went through an extensive renovation, completed about a year ago, that updated all 22 guest rooms—pairing vintage armoires and headboards with amenities such as USB chargers, coffee makers, and small refrigerators.

The original stained glass windows are the focal point of the remodeled dining room, where a complimentary buffet breakfast and afternoon wine and cheese hour are served daily; the renovated front parlor evokes the feel of a speakeasy.

Gosby House Inn is located on Lighthouse Avenue in downtown Pacific Grove, about a 10-minute walk from Lovers Point Park and Beach. For those craving accommodations with ocean views, sister property Green Gables Inn overlooks Monterey Bay. Built in 1888 (making it a year younger than Gosby House Inn), Green Gables recently underwent renovations that unveiled the original maple hardwood floors and preserved decorative crown molding, medallions, and cornices, as well as the ornate stained glass windows.

#### While You’re There:

Visit the famous **Monterey Bay Aquarium,** go whale watching, or take a stroll along **Fisherman’s Wharf.** To cover more ground, consider rolling through town on an e-bike rented from **Mad Dogs and Englishmen.**

Enjoy amazing ocean views at the Sea Ranch Lodge.

### Sea Ranch Lodge, Sea Ranch

The reopening of the Sea Ranch Lodge guest rooms in 2023 marked the completion of the Sonoma Coast property’s multiyear, multimillion-dollar reimagination. Worth the wait, the 17 guest rooms are located in the North Building; built in 1968, it’s one of the oldest structures in the Sea Ranch community.

Secluded seaside trails, rocky bluffs, and windswept beaches dotted along the Pacific Ocean are typically what attract most visitors to the area, but thanks to stellar views and comfortable window seats, guests can simply stay put and enjoy the scenery.

The new guest rooms are steps from Sea Ranch Lodge’s Dining Room, Bar and Lounge, Café, and General Store. The Lodge hosts a variety of complimentary programming, ranging from yoga and trivia nights to art exhibits and hands-on natural fabric dyeing workshops.

#### While You’re There:

Take a peek inside the nondenominational **Sea Ranch Chapel,** head to **Whale Watch Point at Gualala Point Regional Park** to catch sight of mothers and calves migrating to nutrient-rich colder waters, or reserve a wine tasting at small, family-owned **Annapolis Winery.**
