Bacogai’s hot pot experience features Vietnamese influences.

Bacogai and All Day Social

When Kimberly Gamble was deciding what to do with a small spillover space next to her and her mother’s Livermore restaurant, Lanna Thai, she thought back to what she enjoyed eating during a three-month trip to Thailand.

“I ate hot pot all the time,” she says. “At least once a week.”

The communal eating genre, in which raw ingredients are cooked in shared broths before consuming, has long been a popular group dining experience throughout Asia. In the Bay Area, however, Gamble had mostly come across Chinese and Taiwanese iterations with similar approaches. So last year she debuted LT Hot Pot utilizing more Thai influences, including broths such as a sweet-sour-spicy sukiyaki and creamy coconut.

“I really wanted the flavors to reflect my Thai roots,” Gamble says.

Similarly, the partners behind Bacogai—three high school friends from Alameda—wanted their restaurant to reflect their Vietnamese heritage. On their Alameda menu, they emphasize scratch-made broths balancing sweet, sour, and tart with ingredients such as lemongrass, tamarind, pineapple, and fermented bean curd.

“I think Vietnamese hot pot is very different from traditional Chinese or Taiwanese or Japanese,” says co-owner Khanh Tran Kim. “And you can’t really find it in the East Bay.”

LT and Bacogai illustrate two trends within the wave of East Bay hot pot establishments: personalized servings and a wider range of Asian flavors. For the former, _malatang_ -style hot pot allows customers (as at LT) to choose buffet-style among a variety of raw toppings, which are weighed for price and cooked to order in the broth of your choice in individual bowls. Examples include YGF Malatang and Hotpot that opened last February in Dublin’s Ulferts Center, and Zhangliang Malatang, which has three East Bay locations in Berkeley, Concord, and Dublin. Bacogai and Tasty Pot, a San Jose Taiwanese hot pot chain with four East Bay locations, serve bowls or pots with preset broths and ingredients—add-ons are available for an additional charge.

Meanwhile, several new restaurants are specializing or diversifying their styles of hot pot. LT skews Thai and Bacogai Vietnamese, while Mumu Hot Pot (with locations in Emeryville's Bay Street shopping center and in Pleasanton), Hot Pot Nation in Richmond, Dublin’s Shabu King, and Azure in Berkeley offer a pan-Asian approach with broths that range from Japanese sukiyaki to spicy Chinese _mala_.

Regardless of new variations and methods, however, the soul of hot pot remains in the experience, in which diners are able to customize their own hands-on, sensory eating experience to enjoy with others.

“You get to take what you want, try all these different things, decide how much you want,” Gamble says. “It’s just fun putting it all together.”

Adds Tran Kim: “I think people enjoy the idea of eating communally. There’s a food culture in Asia that emphasizes sharing meals with family and friends. There’s a beauty in that.”

### Hot Pot Glossary

**AYCE:** Short for “all you can eat,” an option available at some hot pot restaurants.

**Add-ons:** The seemingly endless variety of ingredients that customers can add to their hot pot experience. Options range from the conventional (mushrooms, spinach, beef slices) to the exotic (tofu, lobster balls, pork intestine).

**_Malatang:_** Individualized bowl style of hot pot that involves choosing raw ingredients from a buffet, which are then cooked for you in a broth of your choice. It’s typically pay by weight, with broths that often highlight numbing Szechuan peppercorn and dried chili peppers.

**Shabu-Shabu:** The Japanese version of hot pot typically characterized by more Japanese ingredients (noodles, for example) and dipping sauces like ponzu.

**Individualized versus communal:** Increasingly popular, individualized hot pot restaurants give customers their own dipping broth or bowls of soup to enjoy solo. Communal hot pots involve broths that are shared by everyone at the table.

**Taiwanese versus Chinese:** Chinese hot pot is typically spicier than Taiwanese, often featuring a chili- and peppercorn-spiked _mala_ broth. However, most hot pot restaurants now offer a wide variety of broths and proteins.

**Sauces:** Used for dipping meat and veggies after cooking them in broth. Each hot pot style has its own specialties, but one common feature in many new restaurants is a sauce bar, in which customers can pick and choose from among their favorites.

**Broths:** Similar to sauces, broths are often regionally specific, but most restaurants now offer a wide variety from which to select—sometimes with a half-and-half option that splits two broths within one pot.
