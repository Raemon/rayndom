Did the closure of Walnut Creek Yacht Club leave a beer-batter-fried hole in your heart? Fear not. A half dozen new East Bay eateries have filled the fish and chips void. And it’s not hard to explain why, says Yacht Club chef and co-owner Kevin Weinberg of one of his former restaurant’s top-selling dishes, which has maintained an enduring appeal as culinary fads have come and gone. “It’s really held its place as a mainstay in American cuisine,” he says. “There’s nothing wrong with fried fish and fries.”

#### Canyon Club Brewery, Danville

Canyon Club owner Kevin Hamilton wasn’t playing around during recipe tasting for what has become one of his new Danville outpost’s most popular entrées. “I’m from Boston, and I take my fish and chips very seriously,” he says. Hamilton’s chef went through eight iterations of the batter until finding one with the perfect lightness and crispiness that still stayed on the fish for each bite. At Hamilton’s brewery and beer garden in the Danville Livery, the kitchen uses rock cod delivered fresh six days a week that is fried in an IPA beer batter and served with coleslaw, malt vinegar, and fries. Tartar sauce is also made in-house because “we couldn’t find any version that resembled what I grew up with.” _[canyonclub.getbento.com/daville-location](http://canyonclub.getbento.com/daville-location)._

#### Cook’s Seafood, Pleasanton

Cook’s seven-years-delayed Pleasanton location has perhaps the strongest regional ties of any of the East Bay’s new fried fish entries. The owners’ sister restaurant has been satisfying seafood fans in Menlo Park for nearly a century, largely on the strength of its bestselling fish and chips. Cook’s sources Atlantic cod, but also Alaskan halibut, a customer favorite and relative rarity among local seafood operators. Both are served simply with steak fries, tartar sauce, and a wedge of lemon. _[cooksseafoodpleasanton.com](http://cooksseafoodpleasanton.com)._

#### Gibson’s Irish Pub, Walnut Creek

The theme of this new hangout in Walnut Creek practically demanded the inclusion of fish and chips. “Being a pub, we thought it was only right to have the No. 1 pub food menu item to offer our guests,” says co-owner Amanda Crammer. It’s become the No. 1 menu item at Gibson’s, which uses lingcod in a light beer batter fried at 325 degrees to ensure a golden crisp on the exterior and moist, fully-cooked fish inside. It comes with thick wedge-cut fries, malt vinegar, and house-made tartar sauce. “The key is the crunchy, crispy batter and fresh, flaky fish,” says Crammer. “That makes it great every time.” _[gibsonswc.com](http://gibsonswc.com)._

Berker Demirtas’s new outpost at Emeryville Public Market has an array of oceanic offerings including clam chowder, calamari, grilled salmon and branzino, and a crab brioche burger. But Le Marine’s calling card is fish and chips, in which skinny pieces of fresh wild-caught cod are fried with a British-style beer batter in two-, three-, and five-piece options and accented with Mediterranean spices. The cod is plated with seasoned fries and a choose-your-own-dipping-adventure of ketchup, coleslaw, malt vinegar, and homemade tartar sauce. _[lemarinefishgrill.com](http://lemarinefishgrill.com)._

#### Sirene, Oakland

Chef and co-owner Gavin Schmidt wanted his new upscale seafood-centric Oakland restaurant to be a destination for celebratory meals (see the $165 Captain’s Platter). But as a nearby resident in the Grand Lake District, he also wanted it to act as an approachable neighborhood pop-in. “I like that dichotomy of a restaurant where you can have a more elegant meal or just sit at the bar with a glass of Riesling and some fish and chips,” he says. Which is why he serves a fairly traditional rendition at Sirene, using local lingcod with a pilsner beer batter seasoned simply with salt. Thicker, English chip-style fries are hand-cut from Kennebec potatoes with a side of _piquillo_ pepper aioli that he describes as “tartar sauce meets In-N-Out secret sauce.” Schmidt recommends mixing in a dash of the restaurant’s homemade fermented sriracha sauce—but just a dash. “It’s definitely got a kick, so proceed with caution.” _[sirene-oak.com](http://sirene-oak.com)._

#### The Forge, Oakland

At the Forge’s new Rockridge location, chef Harrison Chernick channels global influences for his take on fish and chips. He uses a gluten-free chickpea and rice flour wet batter for a crackly crisp similar to Japanese tempura. The golden fried Pacific rockfish is then finished with lemon and pink peppercorn seasoning “to really make the fish pop.” A jalapeño-lime slaw adds a Baja touch, while the caper-tartar sauce lends a creamy, briny note to a dish that is straight out of the classic French meunière culinary playbook. Accompanying fries are the standard crispy 3/16th-inch size familiar in most American burger joints. _[forgerockridge.com](http://forgerockridge.com)._
