August 22, 2014

**The new website,[napasonomamagazine.com](http://napasonomamagazine.com), renders on any mobile or tablet device while keeping the same quality editorial and graphic content as that viewed on the standard desktop website.**

Diablo Publications announced today the release of its new mobile-friendly website for Napa Sonoma magazine: [napasonomamagazine.com](http://napasonomamagazine.com). The website is built on the HTML5 responsive platform, allowing it to format to any screen size while maintaining font sizes and graphic integrity. Boxes of content resize and stack according to device window size, making the website available for readers on any mobile or tablet device. The redesigned site allows for a better rich-media experience. Site visitors no longer have to worry about their Flash Player version or other third-party media players, as videos and audio play in a seamless fashion. Additionally, the new responsive site is multibrowser friendly.

The redesign boasts large photo galleries and more images and content on each page. The new format allows a better visual experience in conjunction with enhanced usability. Napa Sonoma content includes features and stories from the current issue, as well as archived issue information and supplemental features not found in the print magazine.

The newly designed website takes advantage of a proprietary GeoBase technology, which enables users to quickly search and find wineries, restaurants, attractions, outdoor activities, spas and accommodations. The GeoBase system is intended for desktop and mobile use: All listings include searchable information by location, real-time mapping, price and other attributes. 

The redesigned navigation pages include:

• Drink

• Eat

• Play

• Shop

• People

• Subscribe

"Moving to a responsive web format allows a better user experience, and we can now reach our mobile readers in a very engaging way," states Barney Fonzi, Group Publisher for Diablo Publications. "The website now allows our mobile readers to find and research venues and utilize that information as a planning tool for their visit to the Napa Sonoma region. Additionally, the new format will allow our advertisers new online and mobile ad options, and a way to reach their target customers through mobile delivery."
