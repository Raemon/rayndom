#### **Rachel Orvino**

##### Editor in Chief

A longtime pop culture nerd, Rachel got her journalism start as entertainment editor at the  _Sacramento News & Review_ before moving to New York City in 1998. A brief stint at  _New York_ magazine led her to  _Entertainment Weekly,_ where she spent 20 years geeking out with other pop culture crazies. Ultimately exhausted with city life and craving more space to run around with her son and husband, she moved to the East Bay in 2015. In addition to editing for  _Diablo_ magazine, Rachel oversees several publications for the custom division and loves the diversity of content she gets to work with every day. Although entertainment is still a passion, weekends are now spent at soccer games, enjoying hikes on Mount Diablo, and relishing the wealth of great restaurants in the East Bay.

#### **Emilie White**

##### Executive Editor

Born in the Salinas Valley, Emilie White received a B.A. in Spanish and English (with a theater minor) from Santa Clara University and a master’s degree in English from Cal State East Bay. Among other book, magazine, and newspaper editorial work, she interned at City Lights Publishers in San Francisco and is the former co-editor-in-chief of _Arroyo Literary Review._ She is bilingual in Spanish and a lifelong creative writer, whose poetry, fiction, and plays have been featured in _The Bohemian, Occam’s Razor,_ and as part of SCU’s New Playwrights Festival. Emilie can usually be found holding a cappuccino, cheering on both the A’s and the Giants, and reading as many books as she can get her hands on.

#### **Ethan Fletcher**

##### Food Editor

Ethan Fletcher has been in journalism for nearly 20 years, starting as a general assignment reporter at the  _San Francisco Examiner_ after graduating college. Inspired by a trip to Italy in his 20s, he has been covering the East Bay food scene for more than a decade for publications that include  _Via_ , the  _San Francisco Chronicle, Oakland_ magazine, and  _East Bay Express_ in addition to  _Diablo_. He currently spends his time trying to sneak a quick bite in between wrangling twins—and polishing off whatever they refuse to eat.

#### **Deborah Kirk**

##### Editor at Large

Deborah moved to the Bay Area from her native New York in 2003 and is now a proud East Bay resident. She spent many years editing and writing for New York–based publications—such as  _Harper’s Bazaar, Details, Elle,_ and  _Travel and Leisure_ —followed by several years living and reporting overseas. After a time in the Czech Republic and Mexico, she moved to Panama, where she created and launched a number of Spanish-language magazines. She joined Diablo Publications in 2007 to oversee content for the company's custom publications and ultimately for Diablo and Napa Sonoma as well. Now the magazine's editor at large, she remains a regular contributor. She’s an avid swimmer and scuba diver, and volunteers with several local organizations such as Refugee Transitions and Make-A-Wish.
