The Classic Film Series sets its focus on the late 1980s for the next few films, as we have a couple of cult-classic horror-comedies scheduled to show on the giant screen at the historic Orinda Theatre.

On Thursday, September 13, we'll be showing the vampire-themed gem THE LOST BOYS. Directed by Joel Schumacher and featuring a terrific cast of then-unknown young stars (Kiefer Sutherland, Jason Patrick, Coreys Haim and Feldman), _The Lost Boys_ was a mild hit in the summer of 1987, but has gathered a much bigger following over the past three decades, thanks to its popularity on home video and cable. It will be a treat to show this on the big screen at the Orinda, as the footage of the Beach Boardwalk and other Santa Cruz locations are effectively used throughout. 

Then, on October 11, we will show the supernatural laugh-riot BEETLEJUICE. Tim Burton's delightful horror-comedy, which gave star Michael Keaton a chance to show off all his comedic chops, celebrates its 30th anniversary this year. 

Our classic films start at 6:30 p.m. on the second Thursday of each month—make sure to arrive early to secure seating. As always, Republic of Cake donates free cupcakes as prizes for our trivia contest before each show.
