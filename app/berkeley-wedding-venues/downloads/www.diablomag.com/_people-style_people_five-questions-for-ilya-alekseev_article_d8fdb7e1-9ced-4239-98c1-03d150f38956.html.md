In March, the Oakland Roots soccer team made its debut as the new resident squad at the Oakland Coliseum, bringing in more than 26,000 sports fans to the sold-out opening home game. For defender Ilya Alekseev, an Amador Valley High School alum who was born and raised in Pleasanton, playing in the historic venue was just the latest milestone in his young career. A Roots Recognize Initiative recruit, Alekseev was critical in the 2024 playoffs with the Roots’ USL League Two development team, Project 51O, before eventually signing a full contract with the Roots’ first team last August.

#### “That’s what I think before going into the game—we need to do this for the fans, we need to inspire them, and hopefully they can come back next week.”

##### —Ilya Alekseev

* * *

#### Q: How did growing up in Pleasanton shape your love of soccer?

**A:** I started playing soccer on a team at 9 years old, while my teammates started at 4 or 5, so I had a lot of catching up to do. I started playing at [Pleasanton Ballistic United Soccer Club]. … [My dad] was basically my personal coach. Every single morning—before school, after school—just training, training, training, nonstop. I used to hate him for it, but now I’m super grateful.

#### Q: What has it been like to play at the Coliseum?

**A:** It’s actually a dream come true because I grew up in the Bay and we would drive past the Coliseum ... and now playing at it, it’s surreal. It’s a very intimidating structure, but it’s very cool.

#### Q: What are your goals for the rest of the season?

**A:** Since preseason, we’ve always been aiming for the championship. The vibes are high in the locker room. But most importantly, we just focus on one game at a time. … We’re eager to face every team the same way, but in particular probably the California teams, like Monterey [Bay], [Sacramento] Republic—those we give a little extra.

#### Q: What experience do you hope fans have at Oakland Roots games?

**A:** When I was starting out with 51O, I would go to all the games at Laney [College], then Cal State East Bay. The feeling of whenever we see exciting play in the game, especially when we win, was very inspiring for me. For the young kids especially, seeing that [gameplay] from someone my age, they can see that they can do it too, and it can inspire them to be there one day. That’s what I think before going into the game—we need to do this for the fans, we need to inspire them, and hopefully they can come back next week.

#### Q: What are your favorite places to go in the East Bay?

**A:** In the Tri-Valley, there’s Stoneridge [Shopping Center]. I like the outlet mall. It’s all right next to my house, so everyone hangs out around there. I love all the coffee shops in Oakland. I’m getting to that age where I’m dependent on coffee.
