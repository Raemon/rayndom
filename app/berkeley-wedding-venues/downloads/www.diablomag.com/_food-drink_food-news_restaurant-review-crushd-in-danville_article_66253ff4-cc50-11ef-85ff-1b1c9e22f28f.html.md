Tinned fish and small bites are on offer at Crush’d.

Rose Street Co.

When is a wine bar not just a wine bar? When the food is incredible, as is the case at the new Crush’d Wine Bar and Kitchen (which wisely added “and Kitchen” to its name as a reminder). That shouldn’t be surprising given that this is the pet project of Francis X. Hogan, the executive chef and partner at Pleasanton’s rightly lauded Sabio on Main—but it remains noteworthy that some of the best wine bar eats this side of Napa are being served in downtown Danville.

It is, however, technically a wine bar, so we should start with that. As you walk into the warm, contemporary interior offering multiple seating options—high-tops, lounge, banquettes—you’ll notice a crisp line of 24 wines on tap behind the bar. Crush’d aims for a unique but accessible mix, which includes everything from a German Riesling to a Napa cab to a Willamette Valley pinot to a Monterey “orange” albariño—all available in 3-, 6-, and 9-ounce pours, as well as by the carafe and flight.

Choose from 24 wines on tap.

The Crush’d team worked directly with their preferred wineries to provide wine in kegs pourable by tap—a process Hogan says is significantly more eco-friendly and which also ensures consistent quality and temperature for each pour. Breaking from the strict wine bar focus, Crush’d also has a full bar with fun and creative cocktails and a daily 3–6 p.m. Aperitivo Hour featuring drinks and discounted bites.

On to the food, for which Hogan leans into a lighter, more wine-friendly selection of smaller, shareable plates. Cauliflower is a perennial favorite at Sabio, and the slightly tweaked version at Crush’d should prove to be the same. Delivered piping hot, florets are chopped small and roasted a perky golden brown to bring out the brassica’s natural sweetness. It’s seasoned with an addictive chili crisp, the spice of which is soothed perfectly by a silky cashew-based green goddess sauce (a side dish of the herbaceous elixir is provided for further dipping). At $13, it’s a remarkably thoughtful small plate that coaxes about as much flavor as is possible from a vegan dish.

Crush’d serves a variety of open-face tartines.

On the other end of the spectrum, the lamb meatballs are a carnivore’s delight. The petite, loosely packed rounds burst with rich succulence and are accented by a bed of cool herb yogurt and dollops of harissa relish for kick. Both the cauliflower and the lamb are nice examples of a food philosophy that Hogan describes as “fun and approachable but executed at a high level.”

“We’re not trying to shoot over anyone’s head or reinvent the wheel,” he says. “We want to get the best products we possibly can and represent them as well as we can to let them shine.”

The grilled cheese may be Exhibit A for that approach. What could be a pedestrian affair is enlivened with a trio of cheddar, Gouda, and washed-rind cow’s milk cheeses that deliver smooth, nutty, melty goodness accented by sweet honey and salty ribbons of shaved prosciutto. Even the accompanying slices of peach, often an afterthought, are deliciously ripe.

The dish also highlights the wine bar’s unique meat and cheese program. As he did with the wine list, Hogan researched and curated the selection to spotlight small, local producers. All the cheese is from California, while the charcuterie is all domestic, and you can mix and match to create your own custom board—with meats shaved to order via a bar-side manual slicer.

Crush’d provides a full bar.

Seasonality and seafood are other points of emphasis and just as successful. In the shared plates section, the Hokkaido scallop crudo is a work of art: Delicately sweet scallops are dressed with a just-slightly acidic lemon gremolata and compressed sliced cucumbers. As is on-trend these days, Crush’d offers three different kinds of tinned fish, as well as caviar (from California Caviar Company) by the “bump” and in 1-ounce servings with toast and traditional garnishes. Even the deviled eggs have a maritime touch, with the creamy egg filling spiked by smoked salmon and briny trout roe that pops with each bite. Meanwhile, an heirloom tomato panzanella salad delivered an explosion of seasonal flavor. The rough-chopped sourdough croutons are joined by heirloom tomatoes, crunchy cucumbers, and pickled slivers of red onion. The salmon tartare with avocado and citrusy herb salad is a crowd-pleaser among the open-faced tartines on the menu, which added fig and ricotta and Wagyu roast beef specials later in the fall. The latter—soft-toasted Firebrand Artisan Breads sourdough topped with folded slices of tender Wagyu, sweet caramelized onions, and an intensely sharp blue cheese—translates into a highly concentrated spin on a classic roast beef sandwich.

In short, the food is very high quality and well executed while remaining accessible. The fact that it’s offered in a wine bar setting where many might not even order it makes it all the more unusual. Hogan says that was the idea, and he and his partners are eyeing other East Bay projects in their burgeoning restaurant group, including an upcoming sports bar concept in Pleasanton.

“We want to do unique, distinctive restaurants that provide an experience you can’t get anywhere else,” he says.

Mission accomplished at his new “wine bar.” And we look forward to what comes next. _[crushddanville.com](http://crushddanville.com)._
