### Promoting Phone-Free Classrooms

Mobile devices have become a staple in daily life, but their presence in the classroom can be more hindrance than help. Research links high rates of cell phone use among children and teens to distraction in school and lower academic performance, along with cyberbullying, sleep deprivation, and mental health issues. These are the adverse effects that California’s AB 3216, known as the Phone-Free School Act, attempts to curb.

The bill, signed by Governor Gavin Newsom in fall 2024, requires every school district in the state to institute a formal policy limiting or restricting smartphone use in schools by July 2026. AB 3216 and other similar bills in an ever-growing number of states nationwide often see support from both sides of the political aisle, but they have raised concerns among parents, guardians, and school staff.

San Ramon Valley Unified School District (SRVUSD) introduced its policy with the 2025–2026 school year. The guidelines formalize a mostly preexisting practice and prohibit elementary and middle school students from accessing mobile devices—including cell phones and smartwatches—from their arrival on campus through the final bell, though middle school students can use their devices for instructional needs as directed by teachers. High schoolers have the same guidelines as middle schoolers, but may turn their devices on during lunch and break times. Across all grade levels, students who require mobile devices for documented medical needs will have unrestricted access. (Exceptions will be made for everyone in times of emergency.) The policies are intended to facilitate communication between high schoolers heading off campus at lunch and between parents and students regarding after-school transportation.

“It’s very easy for students to be distracted by a notification,” says SRVUSD superintendent CJ Cammack. “What we want to do is maximize instructional time and ensure that students are focused on the learning that’s taking place in front of them and on the personal connection that they can build between each other.”

While some California school districts opt for encasing phones in locked pouches, after consultation with parents, students, and staff during a district-wide Cell Phone Survey and a series of digital community forums, SRVUSD allows pupils to have devices safely stowed and powered off in their backpacks.

Among the chief criticisms cell phone bans face are the burden such restrictions can put on teachers and administrators to implement, differing levels of enforcement, a potential lack of parental compliance, and concerns that students will be marooned without a way to call for help in the event of gun violence on campus or another emergency. The latter worry is one of the reasons SRVUSD allows students to keep their phones on their person, or, if provided, in a repository in the front of the classroom—and that determining the student’s motive for using a device will be the priority before any potential repercussions.

“Why does the student have the phone out? Is it a legitimate emergency that the student is having?” says Cammack. “If not, we want to help educate and then if needed, we will look at corrective actions.” Consequences for violations may include verbal warnings, confiscating the device, and involving parents in the discussion.

Cammack hopes that the formalized guidelines implemented by SRVUSD will not only increase students’ focus and ensure safety inside and outside of the classroom, but help them build healthy habits for the future.

“We recognize that our students are going to continue to have access to their phones and social media outside the school day. … [Trying] to fully remove access, especially for our high school students, doesn’t necessarily build a long-term responsible use that the same students will need when they move into their college and career paths,” he adds. “We hope that we are also able to help develop balanced and responsible use [of] these important devices.”

### Classes Supporting Shared Perspectives

The East Bay has been a major player in the development of ethnic studies as an academic discipline dating back to the 1960s and ’70s, when UC Berkeley (and San Francisco State University) formed some of the first ethnic studies classes. With the passage of AB 101 in 2021, public high schools in our region and across California are expected to include a semester of ethnic studies as part of graduation requirements, starting with the class of 2030.

However, promised funding necessary to enact the mandate was not a part of the 2025–2026 state budget passed in June. Additionally, policies around diversity and inclusivity in academia, and elsewhere, have come under increased scrutiny. With the ethnic studies requirement becoming more controversial since the bill’s passage and financing unclear, school districts are now left with more questions than answers.

Under AB 101, high schools can offer individual ethnic studies courses or combine lessons into preexisting classwork. At Northgate High School in Walnut Creek, an ethnic studies course taught by Meg Honey was introduced two years ago as an elective class and a pilot program in advance of the graduation requirement. Students learn about the history and experiences of African American, Indigenous, Chicanx/Latinx, and Asian American and Pacific Islander communities in the United States. The class includes activities such as reading Japanese American poetry penned in World War II internment camps, visiting the Black Panther Party Museum in Oakland, and crafting shadowboxes addressing stereotypes.

“The course prepares our young people ... to understand our global community,” says Honey. “[They’re] getting a nuanced history where students are able to connect with the stories of people who have traditionally been absent from the historical record. Then they’re able to take those understandings and apply them to situations that are unfolding in their community.”

Dasha, a former student of Honey’s, found that the ethnic studies elective gave her classmates a secure forum to express their own perspectives. “In our seminar discussions, we talked with each other and shared views about difficult topics,” she says. “It was an open and safe space to learn without the fear of saying something wrong.”

Proponents say ethnic studies classes promote empathy, provide students coursework that reflects their experiences, and offer a well-rounded take on history. Research has also shown students in ethnic studies courses have higher academic achievement and graduation rates. Critics counter that making ethnic studies a requirement takes funds and attention away from foundational subjects; other concerns include fair representation and teaching politically charged subject matter.

“[The ethnic studies requirement] has been fraught since its inception, and there have been starts, stumbles, and restarts to try and develop a piece of legislation that’s amenable to all the different interest groups,” said California School Boards Association chief communications officer Troy Flint in a _Los Angeles Times_ article in May. “And I don’t know that we’ve reached that point yet.”

The lack of formal requirements for structuring ethnic studies classes has also come into question, as schools can create coursework that mirrors the demographics of their student populations. In addition to a guide from the state, sample lesson plans and model curriculums have been developed by entities such as the UC Berkeley History- Social Science Project (UCBHSSP) and the Bay Area Regional Ethnic Studies initiative to assist local teachers; the groups also offer professional development for educators.

“This support has taken the form of teaching the history of ethnic studies—content, theory, and pedagogy—as well as planning for implementation of the course at the district, school, or classroom level,” says Jason Muñiz, UCBHSSP site director.

Although the future status of AB 101 remains unclear, one thing is incontrovertible: Having an organized platform for dialogue in the classroom can help young people build their communication skills.

“[I’ve seen] firsthand how [an ethnic studies] class can shift the way students see themselves and their communities,” says Muñiz.

Adds Honey, “The many different students and many different political views that are in my classes create moments where we can have productive conversations.”
