Zelda Elisco is the artist behind Strength Marks.

Zelda Elisco wants to use photography to transform the way people view the human form. In college, she had the idea for Strength Marks, a body positivity online photography and storytelling campaign. “I became interested in testing if art could change the way we saw ourselves,” she says. “Could I take people away from this toxic beauty culture through a therapeutic photography experience and help shift the way they look at their own bodies?”

![DM2509_051_DIG.jpg](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAQAAAADCAQAAAAe/WZNAAAAEElEQVR42mM8U88ABowYDABAxQPltt5zqAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)

Photos in the project encourage subjects to celebrate their scars and stretch marks.

Zelda Elisco

Elisco, who lives in Berkeley and who received her first DSLR camera in middle school, kicked off a series of photo shoots with close friends in 2018, encouraging subjects to highlight their stretch marks by adorning them with biodegradable glitter. In the years since, the international project has grown to feature all body sizes, genders, and scars—both visible and invisible—from self-harm, pregnancy, and other life experiences; almost all subjects are photographed without showing their face.

Elisco now pairs each untouched image with a vulnerable subject interview, highlighting the evolution of each participant’s relationship with their body and showcasing physical features they feel society expects them to diminish. The result is a series of artworks on her website and social media that helps not only shift public discourse, but also the subject’s vision of themselves.

“People write all the time and say, ‘I have never seen a photo of anyone that looks like me and has a scar like me until I saw a Strength Marks picture,’” says Elisco. “We decorate people who have stretch marks, surgery scars, and cellulite, but you don’t necessarily have to have any of those to be in the series, because everybody deserves to be included.”

Strength Marks has been highlighted in _Cosmopolitan Italia, Glamour UK,_ and _Marie Claire Taiwan,_ among other media closer to home. Often, Elisco connects with new subjects simply through word of mouth—and those interested in modeling can submit their information via Strength Marks’ website.

“Humans have a fascination with vulnerability,” Elisco says. “[Additionally,] the anonymity of the participants gives people the bravery to share things that maybe they wouldn’t if their faces were photographed.”

Elisco plans to take Strength Marks beyond the digital realm into a physical exhibition and, eventually, a coffee-table book. “I hope that a Strength Marks photo is some­thing [viewers] remember days after, because it really resonates with them and it’s unlike other images that they’re seeing,” she adds. “[I hope it] helps them shift perspective on what beauty can be and [that] it should be inclusive of everyone.” _[strengthmarks.com](http://strengthmarks.com)._
