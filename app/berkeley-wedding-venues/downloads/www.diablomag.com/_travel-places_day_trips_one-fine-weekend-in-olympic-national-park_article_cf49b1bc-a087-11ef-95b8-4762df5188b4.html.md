Surround yourself with magical greenery along the Hoh Rain Forest’s Hall of Mosses Trail.

Aramark Destinations

Washington State is about more than just Seattle. While the Emerald City gets a lot of glory—and more travelers than most other parts of the state—there is an entire jungle out there to explore (and this one isn’t made of concrete).

**Olympic National Park,** in the state’s northwest corner, is nearly 1 million acres and includes more than 3,000 miles of rivers and streams. And with all that space, there are three distinct ecosystems (glaciated mountains, Pacific coastline, and temperate rainforests). This diversity allows travelers to enjoy an expanse of remote beaches, otherworldly rainforests, and many accommodation options inside the park. It’s also a good starting point for a fabulous road trip that incorporates other Washington burgs, including the adorable beach town of **Seabrook** and Hollywood-heralded **Forks** (site of the _Twilight_ film and book series).

Take to the water at Lake Crescent.

Aramark Destinations

### Exploring the Park

The national park, designated in 1938, is about a two-hour drive from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (an easy flight of just over two hours from Oakland). Olympic National Park’s large size and numerous attractions make it nearly impossible to settle for one home base on your extended weekend trip. Instead, book a couple of days at **Lake Crescent Lodge,** a beachfront property with rustic, cabin-style accommodations, and spend time at **Lake Quinault Lodge,** which is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. The two lodges are around two hours apart, but there’s plenty to see in between.

**Lake Crescent** has an abundance of water action, including scenic boat tours and kayak rides. And when you’re on land, consider a hike through the lush green surroundings. Take a dirt path to **Marymere Falls,** a simple nature trail with a big payoff (one that does require taking a set of wooden stairs). The shorter **Moments in Time Trail** is a .8-mile educational trek outside the property’s door, with interpretive signs noting the history of the trees.

![DM2410_020_DIG.jpg](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAQAAAADCAQAAAAe/WZNAAAAEElEQVR42mM8U88ABowYDABAxQPltt5zqAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)

A trek to Marymere Falls provides plenty of photo opportunities.

Aramark Destinations

While days are meant for exploration inside the park, evenings can be more restful; hole up in the lodge sipping wine by the stone fireplace or playing cards. Dinner offers views of Lake Crescent, Pyramid Mountain, and Mount Storm King that are best enjoyed at sunset. The food at the lodge is divine; the menu includes a Burrata and avocado flatbread and a masterpiece of a salad with fresh berries, feta cheese, toasted hazelnuts, chicken (an optional add-on), and greens.

If your schedule allows, enjoy a soak at **Sol Duc Hot Springs.** This collection of natural springs, located about 20 miles south of Lake Crescent, has waters between 99 and 104 degrees Fahrenheit. While it’s located within Sol Duc Hot Springs Resort, a stay isn’t required. Soaking sessions are available for guests who want to experience the springs without overnight accommodations.

The **Hoh Rain Forest** —about 1.5 hours from Lake Crescent Lodge to the Visitor Center—is one of the premier temperate rainforests in the nation. Easygoing treks like the **Hall of Mosses Trail** (.8 miles) uncover gorgeous expanses of forest, canopies dipping low over the trails, and trunks covered top to bottom in moss. If you continue on to the **Spruce Nature Trail** (1.2 miles), each step you take uncovers a new landscape. Small creeks along the way are filled with fish, and there’s no shortage of amazing birds and other small wildlife.

Once you make it to Lake Quinault, enjoy an evening in the Roosevelt Dining Room. Must-try dishes at the on-property fine-dining establishment include President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s namesake slow-roasted pot roast and a flaky king salmon.

The restaurant opens to the lodge, which promises fireside brews, lawn games, and picturesque views of the surrounding mountains. There’s even a game room and indoor swimming pool.

When you’re ready to explore this corner of the park, the **Quinault Rainforest** offers exceptional experiences similar to Hoh, but with a notable attraction: the world’s largest Sitka spruce tree, which stands 191 feet tall and measures nearly 18 feet in diameter. Consider taking a guided van tour to view this marvel, especially if the trails are wet, or complete one of the trails at your own pace.

### A Taste of Forks

The town of Forks is worth a side jaunt on your journey. The hamlet has a history rich in logging, which you can learn about at the **Forks Timber Museum,** and it’s also a known hot spot for steelhead and salmon activity.

Forks is the setting of the young adult vampire drama, _Twilight,_ and its sequels, and it has leaned heavily into its Hollywood connection with fan-worthy attractions (including a parking spot that is home to Bella’s truck) and the annual **Forever Twilight** festivals. The town’s appealing setting should be reason enough to visit, however. Forks has a gorgeous environment, thanks in part to heavy precipitation, and claims to be the rainiest town in the contiguous United States.

The coastal town of Seabrook is artfully designed.

### Rising Seabrook

An unincorporated planned community, Seabrook was established in 2004 by husband and wife Casey and Laura Roloff. Modeling the town after Seaside, Florida (where _The Truman Show_ was filmed), the Roloffs’ goal was to create a residential haven and idyllic visitor destination on the Washington coastline. Instead of hotels, guests rent houses through **Seabrook** vacation rentals.

Dine alfresco at charming local eateries and peruse goods at shops such as **Joie Des Livres: The Joy of Books** and **Magnolias** clothing boutique. No two stores are the same here; other retail outlets include a dog supply store, bakery, and men’s boutique. After enjoying tacos at **Koko’s,** head to the **Arcade,** an ’80s-style establishment featuring classic games, or rent bikes from **Basecamp** and explore the town.

Every feature of Seabrook was designed to align with a specific vision: creating an almost unreal place to live and play. The houses are massive, and the streets are wide. There are parks, firepits, horseshoe pits, a bocce ball court, and more located throughout the town, and many rentals have pathways that lead directly to the sandy beaches. It all adds up to a quintessential seaside experience that is a blissful complement to the wild natural beauty of Olympic National Park.
