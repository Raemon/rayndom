Each holiday season, Broadway Plaza embraces the spirit of generosity by supporting a local nonprofit through our annual donation drive. This year, we are proud to partner with the **_Assistance League of Diablo Valley_** , a long-standing community organization with more than 58 years of service and over 450 dedicated member-volunteers. Their 16 philanthropic programs provide essential resources to children, families, seniors, and individuals across Contra Costa County.

Assistance League’s impact reaches thousands each year. Through programs such as Operation School Bell®, they provide new clothing to elementary and homeless students, offer literacy and reading support, prepare food boxes for families, assist assault survivors, give comfort items to foster youth, and award significant scholarships that help young adults pursue higher education. Their commitment to meeting community needs with compassion and dignity is at the heart of our Season of Giving.

To celebrate the outstanding work of this organization, Broadway Plaza recognized the _Assistance League of Diablo Valley_ during our annual Holiday Parade of Lights & Tree Lighting. At the event, we proudly launched _our Season of Giving_ campaign by presenting the organization with a $1,500 donation to kick off this year’s drive. We were also honored to recognize their selected Holiday Hero, **_Kristin Olsen_** , who works closely with the Assistance League on key programs supporting local foster youth. To acknowledge her dedication, Broadway Plaza presented Kristin with a $500 gift card in appreciation for her service.

The _Season of Giving_ is an opportunity for our entire community to come together in support of a nonprofit that provides life-changing assistance throughout the year. Every contribution—large or small—helps fuel programs that make a direct and meaningful impact on our neighbors.

As you visit Broadway Plaza this holiday season, we invite you to join us in spreading kindness by supporting our donation drive for Assistance League of Diablo Valley.
