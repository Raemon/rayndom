Growing up in Dublin, Maegha Ramanathan was an enthusiastic athlete who loved competing on the swim team. Less enjoyable, however, were the sexist comments directed at her and other female swimmers.

“I noticed that more and more girls were dropping out of the swim team because of comments emphasizing female inferiority in sports,” says Ramanathan. “[Guys saying] we should pursue our academics … because we’re less likely to succeed in sports just because we’re girls.”

Her frustration moved the 13-year-old Ramanathan to found Girls4Sports, hoping to raise awareness about gender inequality and expand sporting opportunities for underserved girls. The nonprofit hosts athletic equipment drives and free youth-led sports camps and advocacy conferences featuring female athletes like tennis legend Chris Evert.

“We teach [conference attendees] the importance of speaking up and becoming an advocate for yourself,” says the now-17-year-old Ramanathan. “[We want] to build changemakers and empower young women in our communities.”

Girls4Sports now has 30 chapters across the United States (and a few international ones), pushes for legislative changes to promote equity in athletics, and has donated about 10,000 pieces of equipment. The nonprofit describes itself as the “world’s largest youth-led organization fighting gender inequality in sports.”

Ramanathan earned a Billie Jean King Youth Leadership Award in July; she was one of three national honorees lauded for “using the power of sport as a catalyst for change and making a positive impact on society.” She was recognized at the Excellence in Sports Performance Yearly (ESPY) Awards, where she met gymnastics superstar Simone Biles—“a full circle moment,” as she reached out to Biles when starting Girls4Sports—and King.

“Billie Jean King was so sweet, wise, supportive, and inspiring; she told me about the importance of women taking leadership in sports,” says Ramanathan. “Being on the same stage where so many women made history was incredible.”

The 2025 Dublin High School graduate is taking a gap year to focus on Girls4Sports and expansion efforts (the organization also just launched a fellowship focused on cultivating leaders). Most of all, Ramanathan wants to encourage other young girls to make a difference. “Believe in yourself if you want to create change,” she says. “It can be as simple as uplifting someone in your community … because small things build over time. At Girls4Sports, we’re changing the game, one girl at a time.” _[girls4sportsequality.org](http://%20girls4sportsequality.org)._
