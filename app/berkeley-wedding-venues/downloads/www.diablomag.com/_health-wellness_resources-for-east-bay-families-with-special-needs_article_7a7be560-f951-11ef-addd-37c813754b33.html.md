The East Bay Regional Park District’s All Abilities Day provides hands-on education for kids and adults.

Carl La Rue

From peals of high-pitched laughter to cries of dismay, a cacophony of noise can be heard at most children’s attractions. While that energy can be part of the fun, there are those who can’t take the sensory overload, including kids with autism. Children with physical differences might also find popular destinations such as amusement parks or playgrounds to be challenging.

In the East Bay—and around the country—many family-oriented attractions offer options to accommodate guests who have special physical and neurological needs. The East Bay Regional Park District has hosted All Abilities Day since 2017; the events include American Sign Language interpreters and natural education experiences that are wheelchair accessible. The latest All Abilities Day took place on March 4 at Big Break Regional Shoreline in Oakley. The Park District has also improved accessibility through exhibit presentations, audio recordings, and large-print materials for visitors with low vision. _[ebparks.org](http://ebparks.org)._

This past October, the Wave aquatics facility in Dublin introduced its Sensory Splash program, designed for individuals with sensory sensitivities. On one Sunday a month, from October through April, families with special needs can swim at the Natatorium pool without music or unnecessary noise. _[thedublinwave.com](http://thedublinwave.com)._

Kiddie standby Chuck E. Cheese hosts Sensory Sensitive Sundays at its Brentwood location, which opens two hours earlier than its typical 11 a.m. start time on the first Sunday of every month. Guests can play in the arcade with reduced noise, dimmer lighting, and quieter dining as part of a program developed with the Center for Autism and Related Disorders. _[chuckecheese.com](http://chuckecheese.com)._

Art and history lovers feel welcome at the KultureCity Sensory Inclusive–certified Oakland Museum of California (OMCA). Along with staff and volunteers who are trained to help guests experiencing sensory overload, OMCA can provide bags with fidget gadgets, noise-cancelling headphones, and other support tools. _[museumca.org](http://museumca.org)._

#### Play Spaces and Playgrounds

Erika and Chris Buxton opened their We Rock the Spectrum Kid’s Gym in Antioch seeking to help other families with neurodivergent kids. The gym provides play equipment designed for children with sensory processing disorders. Guests can work on their fine-motor skills, build muscles while jumping on a trampoline or climbing a play structure, and relax in a calming room, among other options. _[werockthespectrumantioch.com](http://werockthespectrumantioch.com)._

Alameda is home to Swings and Wings, a “sensory-rich play space” for children 6 months to 8 years of age. Kids can enjoy swings, fine-motor activities, and climbing equipment at drop-in hours, classes, private parties, and camps. _[swingsandwings.com](http://swingsandwings.com)._

Families in San Ramon and Berkeley may look to Spirited Play Labs for an inclusive members-only space for children 18 months to 8 years old, supported by trained staff members. The play equipment is aimed at building fine motor skills, language, cognition, social abilities, sensory processing, and more. _[spiritedplaylabs.com](http://spiritedplaylabs.com)._

No membership is required to visit one of the many local playgrounds for kids with varying physical needs. Heather Farm Park in Walnut Creek has been home to its beloved all-abilities playground since 2014; geared toward kids 2 to 12 years old, the 30,000-square-foot space has play structures, climbing hills, and shock-absorbing surfaces. _[walnutcreekartsrec.org](http://walnutcreekartsrec.org)._ Imagine Playground at Dublin Sports Grounds opened in 2021 and features a play structure, accessible pathways, and an all-inclusive picnic area. _[dublin.ca.gov](http://dublin.ca.gov)._ Matteo’s Dream, an all-abilities playground in Concord’s Hillcrest Community Park, is the largest playground in the city. _[cityofconcord.org](http://cityofconcord.org)._
