Timber Cove has several spots to enjoy the views.

Known for its top wineries, luxe resorts, and Michelin Guide restaurants, Sonoma County is also home to striking natural attractions, especially along the rugged Pacific Ocean coastline. Rocky cliffs, fierce waves, and sprawling beaches are just a few of the sights along curvy Highway 1.

Depending on your final destination, a road trip to the **Sonoma Coast** from the East Bay can take under 90 minutes. The seaside town of **Bodega Bay** is a charming stopover if you are journeying further north or a welcoming stay unto itself. Stretch your legs with a walk along the beach at **Doran Regional Park.** The two-mile stretch has soft sand and calmer waters, making it perfect for picnicking families. A peninsula that forms the entrance to Bodega Harbor, **Bodega Head** is a prime viewing site for gray whales during migrating season, which peaks in late winter and spring.

Try fish and chips at the Birds Cafe in Bodega Bay.

A meal in Bodega Bay can offer plenty of eye candy along with your food. For fine dining and relaxing vistas, try the **Tides Wharf and Restaurant** and **Bay View Restaurant and Lounge** (only open for dinner). Those seeking more casual fare should grab lunch at the **Birds Cafe,** which takes its moniker from the Alfred Hitchcock movie by the same name that was filmed here and in nearby Bodega. Order at the counter, and sit at one of the picnic tables on the outdoor patio with views of the marina and bay. Top picks include fish and chips, fish tacos, barbecued oysters (when they are in season), and crab and lobster rolls; make sure to also try the artichoke fritters. **Patrick’s of Bodega Bay Salt Water Taffy,** established in 1960 and located a short walk from the Birds Cafe, has sweet treats for the road. **Spud Point Crab Co.** also serves seafood sandwiches and its well-loved clam chowder. **Rocker Oysterfeller’s at the Wharf** is a newer addition to the town’s culinary scene and promises fresh seafood infused with flavors of the South.

### Beach Time

**Sonoma Coast State Park** covers 17 miles from Bodega Bay to a bit north of Jenner and is one of the largest parks in California. It comprises multiple beaches, including **Shell Beach, Salmon Creek Beach,** and **Goat Rock Beach.** The latter is a favorite among travelers and locals who are drawn to its hiking trails, accessible shoreline, and wildlife. Goat Rock hosts a colony of Pacific harbor seals on a spit formed at the mouth of the Russian River; pupping season (March to August) is especially popular, although visitors must stay a minimum of 50 feet from the seals, and dogs are not allowed.

### Scenic Stay

Situated on a vast bluff off Highway 1 near Jenner, **Timber Cove** resort feels like a rustic, old-school lodge with its wood and stone accents, but it has plentiful modern amenities. The property dates back to 1963, though it went through a major refresh in 2016. It has 46 guest rooms, many of which feature private decks with ocean or forest views and cozy fireplaces; outdoor spaces with firepits, Ping-Pong, and convivial seating arrangements; and a new Reset and Restore Suite, with leading-edge recovery tools and more traditional options, such as a rock sauna and cold plunge tub.

The Timber Cove grounds consist of 25 acres, including two miles of hiking trails, that are ripe for exploration. The dramatic landscape is picture-perfect—as evidenced by photographer Ansel Adams’s inspired images of Timber Cove—and there are various overlooks and rest areas where visitors can revel in the surf and sea.

Coast Kitchen spotlights regional ingredients.

Another Instagram-worthy attraction is the Bufano Peace Statue Monument, a 93-foot sculpture by artist Beniamino Bufano that is located next to the resort. The obelisk, also known as “The Expanding Universe” and “Madonna of Peace,” was designed in the 1960s, and while it is exhibiting some wear, it stands tall as a symbol of peace from its spot looking out on the Pacific.

After traversing the grounds, relax in Timber Cove’s Great Room, an expansive communal space with a massive stone fireplace, a bar, antler chandeliers hanging from the high-beamed ceiling, and a collection of board games and vinyl records (there is a Crosley record player in every guest room). The Great Room is connected to Coast Kitchen restaurant, which serves well-executed seasonal fare with a focus on regional ingredients. The eatery’s chef-partner Seadon Shouse has a deep connection with the Northern California coast and often integrates locally sourced ingredients into the menu.

A Taste of Coastal Foraging includes ocean-side excursions.

### Gather Together

Shouse’s passion for the area’s bounty is reflected in Timber Cove’s recently introduced A Taste of Coastal Foraging experience. Led by local guide Ty Kun, participants on the three-hour excursions meet in the Great Room then drive to nearby sites where they harvest wild edibles including mushrooms, greens, and seaweed, depending on the weather and season. Moderate hiking is involved, and the year-round outings continue in light rain. Spring might yield fiddleheads, ferns, miner’s lettuce, and hairy bitter cress; tidal foraging is good May through July, with mollusks and crustaceans on the collection list. Fall possibilities include fungi, berries, and acorns.

Guests use buckets for foraging—they are instructed to never eat anything without consulting the guide first—and learn about the interconnectivity of the environment and the food we consume. Kun reviews all of the collected items once the group returns to Timber Cove and details how everything can be safely processed and used. The experience concludes with a curated tasting of bites at Coast Kitchen, highlighting the ingredients.

The foraging adventure is less about the harvested haul, however, and more about interacting with the natural world.

“[Participants] come back with a sense of wonder and curiosity,” says Margaret Grahame, Timber Cove’s project and community manager. “This area is magical, and we want to share it with people so they can learn and experience a different way of being.”
