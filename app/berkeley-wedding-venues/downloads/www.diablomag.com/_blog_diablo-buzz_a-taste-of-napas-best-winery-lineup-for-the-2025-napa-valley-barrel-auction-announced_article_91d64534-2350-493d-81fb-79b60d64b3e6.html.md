Guests will mingle with the winemakers and taste wines directly from the barrel, including exclusive offerings from the 2023 vintage. Karen MacNeil, author of The Wine Bible, calls the 2023 vintage "one of the most phenomenal vintages ever in Napa Valley."

Those lucky enough to be the highest bidder for each lot will take home a commemorative barrel head signed by the winemaker.

"We particularly like the Barrel Auction as an incredible way to meet so many winemakers, one on one. We always find hidden gems that are great fun to bid on," noted John and Nancy Hahn, Barrel Auction attendees.

To secure your ticket to this must-attend occasion, visit [collectivenapavalley.org](https://www.collectivenapavalley.org/events/2025-barrel-auction/). Two packages are available: the Napa Valley Barrel Auction or the all-access weekend experience.

_Proceeds will benefit Napa Valley Vintners' Youth Wellness Initiative with a focus on empowering youth to lead healthy, balanced lives._
