_My Cambodia: A Khmer Cookbook_

Penguin Random House

### East Bay Chefs Share Recipes, Struggles

Two new cookbooks with strong East Bay connections hit bookshelves in the last week. **Nite Yun,** who shot to foodie fame with her now-shuttered homestyle Cambodian concept **Nyum Bai** in Oakland, released [_My Cambodia: A Khmer Cookbook_](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/742374/my-cambodia-by-nite-yun-with-tien-nguyen/) on Tuesday. In the book written with Tien Nguyen, she offers recipes from Nyum Bai and Lunette, her new noodle bar in San Francisco’s Ferry Building. But she also shares deeply personal essays from her life, including ones about growing up in Stockton with parents who escaped the Cambodian genocide and her struggles to adapt to the sudden national acclaim of Nyum Bai after it opened in the Fruitvale district in 2017.

![Good-Things;-Penguin-Random-House.gif](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAQAAAADCAQAAAAe/WZNAAAAEElEQVR42mM8U88ABowYDABAxQPltt5zqAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)

_Good Things: Recipes and Rituals to Share with People You Love_

Penguin Random House

And last week, **Samin Nosrat** released the highly anticipated follow-up to her James Beard Award–winning _Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat,_ a bestseller that spurred a hit Netflix documentary series and made the veteran East Bay chef and teacher a household name in cooking circles. Her latest, _[Good Things: Recipes and Rituals to Share with People You Love](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/622646/good-things-by-samin-nosrat/%20),_ is packed with 125 recipes developed at her home in Oakland (where the food photography for the book was taken). Nosrat also reveals her struggles with depression following the pandemic and the death of her father, and how it impacted her approach to cooking. 

### $2 Burgers Debut off Cal Campus

Well, this is a restaurant that knows its target audience. **Campus Burgers,** sporting a streamlined menu headlined by $2 hamburgers and $3 cheeseburgers, launched with a bang last week on Channing Way just two blocks off the UC Berkeley campus. The mini chain with two locations in San Jose reportedly [celebrated its grand opening](https://www.sfgate.com/food/article/burger-spot-opens-by-uc-berkeley-21051259.php) last Friday by giving out more than 1,500 free smashburgers to an audience composed mostly of hungry, cash-strapped Cal students. To keep prices that low, the bright, neon-filled throwback relies on high volume and focusing on a handful of items, including burgers, grilled cheese, hand-cut fries, and shakes, along with a rotating special menu item. 

### Original Joe’s Reopening in Weeks?

It’s been radio silence from the team at **Original Joe’s** since a kitchen fire shuttered its hotly anticipated new Walnut Creek restaurant after a packed opening weekend in early August. And while there’s been no official reopening update—the restaurant’s latest Instagram post remains the one from August 18 announcing the fire and closure—we do have some unofficial news to report. Take it for what it’s worth, but _Dish_ dropped by the Broadway Plaza location in person late last week, where an employee there told us that the restaurant was aiming to relaunch by the first week of October (but that the second week might be more realistic).

### Signage Up at Stereo 41

Speaking of radio silence, the new downtown Walnut Creek collaboration from brother-sister team Victor Ghaben (of World Famous Hotboys) and Sofia Ghaben (of Lita), has remained a bit of a mystery. Taking over the former PG&E service center building at 1535 Bonanza Street, **Stereo 41** will be a hi-fi lounge concept serving contemporary Middle Eastern fare with a Japanese bent led by executive chef Jonathan De La Torre, who previously worked at higher-end San Francisco restaurants such as Mourad, Nopa, and Quince. And while rumors have emerged of an in-house DJ booth and indoor and outdoor seating, an actual opening date for the long project has been kept very much under wraps. But it appears that a launch may soon be imminent: Signage has reportedly been seen on the exterior of the building, while Victor Ghaben admitted that things were “getting closer.” Stay tuned…

### Small Bites From Around the East Bay

**Blue Bottle Coffee** is [shuttering its café](https://www.berkeleyside.org/2025/09/19/blue-bottle-wc-morse-roasted-and-raw-closing) inside the beautifully restored historic W.C. Morse building in Oakland’s Temescal district as of September 26. Bummer. 

Check out this nice [roundup](https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2025/09/19/oktoberfest-2025-your-bay-area-guide-to-beer-brats-oompah-music/) of **Oktoberfest** events around the Bay Area, including in downtown Walnut Creek this Friday and Saturday, and at various restaurants and breweries across the East Bay. 

The 17-year-old **Opa! Restaurant Group** [reportedly](https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2025/09/22/san-jose-opa-restaurant-food-jobs-economy-court-retail-property-work-dine/) filed for bankruptcy and shuttered its remaining three Greek restaurants in the South Bay. Opa! suddenly closed its popular Walnut Creek location earlier this spring after a 13-year run downtown. 

Town Fare chef **Michele McQueen** [explains](https://www.sfgate.com/food/article/new-oakland-bar-enforcing-unusual-rule-21029553.php) the origin story behind her new Uptown cocktail bar **Lucy Blue** (it’s named after her two cats) and the rationale behind enforcing a (slightly controversial) dress code there. 

[**Masala Ferry**](https://masalaferry.com) opened in San Ramon with an emphasis on south Indian biryani rice dishes.
