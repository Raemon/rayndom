# **The Mobility Gap**

**Whether they are making trips to the doctor, buying groceries, or meeting up with friends, seniors can face real challenges when it comes to getting out of the house._Diablo_ looks at how cities and towns in the East Bay are increasingly under pressure to meet the transportation needs of older residents. **

##### **BY CLAY KALLAM**

“I wish someone could take me grocery shopping.”

Nancy Sui is 83 and lives alone in Orinda. The former pediatric nurse—who spent 60 years on the job—has had both hips replaced, and glaucoma has damaged her vision.

For most people, going grocery shopping is a chore; however, for Sui, it’s just one part of her freedom she’s had to leave behind. Driving any distance is now beyond her capabilities, and though her children will provide rides if possible, she always hesitates to ask.

“They’re so busy,” she says. “They help when they can.”

Sui, like many housebound seniors, has few options when it comes to getting a ride. She mainly relies on Seniors Around Town, a service of the nonprofit Orinda Association. “They are booked one or two weeks in advance,” she says, “and they don’t have enough volunteers. I only use them to get to doctors’ appointments. I wouldn’t feel right asking for a ride to the grocery store or a class at the community center.”

Compared to choices like Lyft or Uber, Seniors Around Town offers older users rides from their fellow Orinda resi­­dents. “They’re not strangers,” says Sui of Seniors Around Town volunteers. “I feel safe, and they help me if I need it. It’s been a lifesaver for me.” 

### **ROADBLOCKS TO AGING IN PLACE**

“Aging is not an illness,” says Elaine Welch, CEO of Mobility Matters, a local nonprofit that offers door-to-door transportation to seniors. “As we get older, we lose the ability to do certain things, but we still want to engage in life.”

And life in the East Bay is accessed by automobile, especially in Contra Costa County. The obvious alternative is public transit, but there are only a few scattered Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) stations, and bus service in suburban Contra Costa is focused on major roads that lead to BART.

For seniors living even a few blocks off a street like Ygnacio Valley Road, getting to a bus requires a longer walk than many of them can make. 

In addition, bus service isn’t as frequent as it is in more urban areas, so long waits at bus stops can cause problems as well, particularly in rainy or cold weather.

In short, public transit in Contra Costa County is not going to solve the transportation problem for older adults with physical limitations. Mobility is a necessity, but for many housebound seniors, it’s not that easy to find.

Not surprisingly, then, the top reason older adults reach out for help is finding transportation, according to USAging, a national organization focused on senior issues. Without mobility, everything, especially the goal of aging in place in a familiar home, becomes much more difficult.

According to a 2023 study by the National Institutes of Health, “The current transport system is insufficient to support the increasing numbers of the aging population and unresponsive to older adults’ specific needs.”

And though there’s a lot to unpack in that sentence, perhaps the most important phrase is “increasing numbers.” That same report states that the 60 and over population is expected to be 2.1 billion worldwide in 2050, up from 1.4 billion in 2020.

Statewide, the numbers are just as daunting. By 2040, the Public Policy Institute of California estimates that the senior population will increase by 43 percent—from 14 percent to 22 percent of the total population. Locally, that would mean 37 percent of Walnut Creek’s residents will be senior citizens by 2040, according to Plan BayArea and CensusReporter, and Orinda will be at 31 percent. Berkeley and Pleasanton will be at 23 percent and 24 percent, respectively—and the impact on all communities will be hard to ignore and even harder to pay for.

“Aging in place costs money,” says Angie Perone, an assistant professor at the School of Social Welfare at UC Berkeley. Understandably, most people would prefer to remain in their homes, but once they lose the ability to drive, aging in place becomes much more difficult.

One big reason is access to health care.

“So many people don’t get preventive care” because of lack of transportation, says Welch, “and they wind up in the emergency room.”

Doctors’ appointments not only require trips to and from a medical facility but also an indeterminate amount of time waiting for and seeing a doctor. That means each trip requires two rides, and arranging those rides can be a major problem. In fact, Alignment Health, a Southern California health-care company, reports that two-thirds of seniors cite transportation issues as a major barrier to accessing health services.

And health, of course, isn’t just physical. Mental health requires social interaction, and seniors without the ability to drive often become isolated—which leads to both physical and mental health issues.

“Many people become isolated and institutionalized because of lack of transportation,” says Welch.

“There is an assumption that older adults are doing just fine,” says Perone, but she disagrees. “I want to smash that assumption.”

Even if cities and public agencies do recognize that the rapidly growing senior population needs more help getting around, they have to find the financial resources to provide it. 

Most cities offer classes and programs for older adults, often at senior centers, but those classes and programs don’t help if the participants can’t get there. And, of course, hiring a yoga teacher is a lot less expensive than organizing and paying for transportation, especially as a city-run system would have to account for potential liability issues.

What local organizations usually do instead is farm out transportation to nonprofit organizations like Seniors Around Town or Mobility Matters, or contract with Lyft or Uber to offer discounts or free rides. However, neither is a perfect solution.

These aforementioned nonprofits have to rely on volunteers as drivers, and there are more seniors needing rides than there are people to drive them.

Mobility Matters has 500 members who need help with transportation, but Welch can’t cover all the rides they need. “We are currently limited by our number of volunteers,” she says.

Some cities, like Walnut Creek and Berkeley, offer Lyft rides as an alternative. Seniors can sign up for a program—with a minimal cost—that gives them access to 10 rides a month.

Ten rides may seem like a lot, but since a trip to the doctor or the grocery store takes time after arrival, one trip actually eats up two rides. In reality, 10 rides equate to five trips a month, or one every six days—and getting out and about only once in six days is far from ideal.

Rideshare services like Lyft have their own issues too. Lyft drivers only pick up and drop off at the sidewalk, and seniors with mobility problems can find it difficult to get out to the street or maneuver into a medical office.

### **MISSED CONNECTIONS**

“I have always tried to be independent,” Sui says, “and I have a hard time asking for help.” So she orders food online and won’t trouble Seniors Around Town for rides to social activities.

As a result, she doesn’t often interact with her peers in real life. “I see the volunteer drivers, but that’s about it,” says Sui.

“The phone and Zoom are fine, but they are not the same as being face-to-face. If you can’t meet with other people, you get depressed.”

But she knows there are not enough volunteer drivers to accommodate everyone who needs a lift. 

“The medical appointments are more important,” she says, and Sui doesn’t want to take a ride to the community center when it might mean another senior can’t get to the doctor. 

And as a long-time nurse, Sui knows the importance of preventive health care and getting medical checkups. 

“There are many people who aren’t going to the doctor,” she says. “They’re going to wind up in acute care, and it’s going to cost so much more money.”

But there’s nothing Sui can do to change the situation, as much as she would like to. 

“When I was 70,” she says, “I didn’t get what it meant to be 80.” And at 83, essentially housebound, she’s at the mercy of cities and agencies that don’t prioritize senior services and has to rely on the kindness of strangers to get her where she needs to go.

“There’s a stigma to aging,” says Sui. “You become invisible. I feel like we’re kind of lost.”

Especially if you can’t find a ride.

## Justice for Every Generation

**CONTRA COSTA SENIOR LEGAL SERVICES OFFERS FREE HELP FOR ADULTS 60-PLUS.**

##### **BY RACHEL ORVINO**

**When Matthew Hulse,** executive director of Contra Costa Senior Legal Services (CCSLS), first began working in the field of elder rights, he was struck by the invisibility of older adults. “We owe seniors everything, and we should take care of them,” says Hulse. “There’s discrimination [and] ignoring them, and there’s also the sense that they become less valuable and attractive because they are old. … Do we want to be the kind of society that takes care of our seniors, and what does that mean for our individual decisions?” 

CCSLS has been protecting the rights of older adults since it launched in 1976, offering free legal advice, community education, and representation to local residents over the age of 60, with a focus on housing, consumer protection, and elder abuse. The Concord-based nonprofit also helps clients with advance planning—including power of attorney and advance health-care directives—questions around social security and disability benefits, bankruptcy, wills, and more.

#### **Q: ALONG WITH SOCIAL ISOLATION, HEALTH CARE, AND POVERTY, WHAT ARE SOME OF THE TOP CONCERNS FOR OLDER ADULTS?**

**A:** The intensity of the Bay Area [real estate market makes] housing really tough for a lot of people. … [There is also] this huge wealth transfer from generation to generation as people age, and I think that fuels elder abuse. There are so many families that end up thinking, well, _Grandma has a house. That’s where the money is. She doesn’t really need it._ And they end up in some sort of scheme. If you’re careful with your will and trust, that can help this whole transfer. … People go into this [later life stage] uneducated and unprepared as their abilities to deal with crises diminish. It’s a brew for a lot of problems.

#### **Q: HOW CAN PEOPLE PROTECT THEMSELVES AND LOVED ONES?**

**A:** We’re constantly doing presentations in libraries and senior centers. Get educated on issues around the end of life; if your parents are still alive, do it for them now and then turn around and do it for your kids. It’s a gift to the next generation to get your affairs in order. … Stay in touch with the older people in your life. … One of my lawyers worked with this woman who had been sending cash in shoeboxes overseas for more than a year before she emptied her bank account and then came to us. More connectivity with our older neighbors and friends can help spot these issues. I think everybody should get an education about fraud. … Digital literacy is absolutely essential. There needs to be more opportunities in churches and community centers for seniors to learn some basics about technology and avoiding fraud.

#### **Q: WHAT ARE TYPICAL LEGAL ISSUES RELATED TO HOUSING?**

**A:** Seniors are the fastest-growing segment of the unhoused population. … Evictions are obviously a big one, as are habitability issues when landlords aren’t fixing a window or the heat. And the other side of habitability is what are called reasonable accommodations. Maybe a senior’s mobility is going down, and they can’t navigate [steps]. Seniors can ask the landlord to put in a little ramp, and maybe the [renter] doesn’t even know that that’s something they can ask for, so they think they have to move. We’re often in a position of negotiating with the landlord so that people can stay in place longer.

## Supporting Seniors

**REGIONAL PROGRAMS AND SERVICES PROVIDE OLDER ADULTS WITH INFORMATION TO HELP PROTECT THEM FROM SCAMS, TECHNOLOGY TRAINING, AND TRANSPORTATION ASSISTANCE.**

**During the pandemic,** Dougherty Valley High School student Adya Gupta saw her grandmother regularly getting targeted with phone or text scams aimed at seniors. Determined to raise awareness about such fraudulent efforts, Gupta educated herself on preventive measures. She went on to cofound Impactt Kids, a youth-driven nonprofit that offers hands-on workshops to provide this vulnerable population with the tools and knowledge needed to avoid getting scammed. Impactt Kids now has more than 40 teen members in the East Bay and around the world, providing safety workshops at senior centers and older residential communities.

“We talk about phishing emails, fake messages that come from scammers, identity theft, tech support scams, and relationship scams,” says Gupta. “We show real examples and walk through them together, step by step; we also focus on the emotional side of scams. The main takeaway message that I want seniors to get from these workshops is if something feels off, pause and double check who this caller is because it’s better to be safe than sorry.” 

Gupta says she has heard feedback from workshop participants who successfully used the scam prevention strategies, and Impactt Kids has partnered with organizations such as Choice in Aging and Contra Costa Senior Legal Services to help spread the word. The nonprofit is also working on increasing its resources online, providing videos and straightforward guidelines.

The intergenerational aspect of pairing older adults with teenage instructors adds a social component to the valuable educational sessions. “The seniors can just be more comfortable with us because they see us as their grandchildren, someone they can relate to,” says Gupta. “We have back-and-forth conversations where they can feel comfortable in a safe space.” [_impacttkids.org_](http://impacttkids.org) _._

Choice in Aging’s Debbie Toth is a longtime advocate for seniors.

## Living with Joy and Dignity

**CHOICE IN AGING, A NONPROFIT BASED IN PLEASANT HILL, IS RESHAPING ELDER CARE.**

**For 76 years,** Choice in Aging has promoted inclusion and independence for local residents. Founded as a polio rehab center, it evolved to support older adults through innovative community-based programs. The nonprofit was California’s 16th licensed Adult Day Health Care center and the state’s first Alzheimer’s Day Care Resource Center. It continues to grow today, hosting an intergenerational Montessori preschool and offering comprehensive case management and culturally specific services, among other programs. Whether aiding dementia patients, providing skilled nursing, or facilitating bonding between kids and seniors, the nonprofit remains rooted in its mission of helping seniors live with joy and dignity.

Debbie Toth is the president and chief executive officer of Choice in Aging and a committed champion for older adults. She helped create the master plan for aging in California, served on the state’s Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders Advisory Committee, and sits on the Disability and Aging Community Living Advisory

Committee. Choice in Aging, with Satellite Affordable Housing Associates, is also developing a future Aging in Place campus that will provide independent housing and services at its site in Pleasant Hill.

#### Q: IS THERE A CENTRAL PURPOSE TO YOUR ADVOCACY WORK?

**A:** We’re focused on creating a long-term care system because what we currently have is a de facto long-term care _lack_ of system—basically an institutionally biased poverty pipeline. You spend every penny you have [on care and housing], and then when you have no more options, you either end up in skilled nursing or on the streets. We are trying to create a long-term care system that, instead of biasing institutionalization and homelessness, biases home and community-based services. If we have accessible transportation, if we have adult day health care, if we have case management, if we have nutrition, fall prevention, and connection services available in community, people are happier, they’re healthier, and it costs less money for taxpayers. We are looking at how we change policy and budget so that we bias the funding to community-based resources rather than institutions. 

#### **Q: WHAT ARE THE MAIN ISSUES OLDER ADULTS ARE FACING NOW?**

**A:** We’ve gained three decades of life expectancy in the last century and did nothing to plan for it, not in our personal lives, not in our health-care systems, not in our parks and recreation spaces [or] in government. …

The growing impoverishment of older adults is the primary issue. … There is a broad continuum of aging. You have your bocce-ball-playing, cruising older adults. You have your slowing down, hanging out at the bridge club folks. You have this whole spectrum—dementia, non-dementia, physical disabilities—all of those things. For each of those different stages, age-friendly means different things. 

[Additionally], technology is developing exponentially, and we have left our older adults behind. How are we going to bridge that digital divide? That really needs to be a focus of what we do in the Bay Area. How do we invest in making technology accessible for older adults? ... There are so many beautiful ways that technology can help people age in place, but if the older adults are afraid of it or don’t understand it, they’re going to reject it and not get the benefits. **—R.O.**
