An interesting trend is the high percentage of devilish delights—it seems five out of 10 of my picks have an element of supernatural evil in the story. I’ve always loved horror films but this feels like a lot, perhaps its a reaction to the strange times we are living through. Enjoy!

* * *

![Screen-Shot-2024-07-19-at-12.36.02-PM.jpg](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAQAAAADCAQAAAAe/WZNAAAAEElEQVR42mM8U88ABowYDABAxQPltt5zqAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)

### 1\. THELMA

The surprise of the summer is writer-director Josh Margolin’s comedy dedicated to his spunky grandmother. June Squibb, the 94-year-old lead actress, is spectacular in the title role as a grandmother who gets ripped off by some con artists and vows revenge on these soulless scammers. The late Richard Roundtree (_Shaft_) is wonderful as her friend, as is Fred Hechinger (_The White Lotus,_ season one) as her sweet grandson. Genuinely funny throughout, _Thelma_ pulls back when it could have veered into silly, _Grumpy Old Men_ territory, instead providing touching thoughts about aging. The movie has been doing bang-up business at the Orinda Theatre—do as I did, take your parents and your sister. Or any family and friends that you love.

* * *

#### 2\. LONGLEGS

Another instant classic, _Longlegs_ is the spookiest film of the summer. On one hand, its a serial killer procedural with shades of _Silence of the Lambs_ and _Seven,_ then its a supernatural occult thriller like _Rosemary’s Baby._ Writer-director Oz Perkins (son of _Psycho_ ’s Anthony Perkins) is working at the top of his game throughout, framing every shot and scene with a creepy sense of dread. Maika Monroe is riveting as an FBI agent chasing the killer, and Nicolas Cage, almost unrecognizable in layers of prosthetics and makeup, brings his scenery chewing game to the title role.

* * *

#### 3\. CHALLENGERS

This sexy, made for grownups, drama set in the world of pro tennis in an absolute banger from start to finish. Expertly directed by Luca Guadagnino (_Call Me By Your Name_), the film zips back and forth through a timeline of some 14 years, as three tennis stars juggle their games and sex lives in unpredictable fashion, thanks to a knockout screenplay by Justin Kuritzkes. The three stars, Mike Faist, Josh O’Connor, and especially Oakland’s Zendaya, rock their respective roles.,Hopefully Zendaya will be Oscar-nominated next year for her smart and crafty turn as a former tennis star turned coach, she’s absolutely dynamite in her most mature role to date.

* * *

#### 4\. GHOST: RITE HERE RITE NOW

This concert film was a major treat and a great surprise. I was a fan of Ghost’s catchy, infectious rock songs and cinematic music videos, but this concert film, shot over two nights at the Forum in Los Angeles, is next level stuff. The screening I caught in XD at the Century multiplex was packed with Ghost fans much more hardcore than me, and they were bobbing along to the hits, “Spillways”, “Mary on a Cross”, “Dance Macabre”, and “Square Hammer,” and laughing to the supernatural narrative that played out backstage and above stage throughout the film. I have never seen a concert film with such precise visuals and sound. I think the cameras and operators were digitally removed from the film, which enhanced the experience exponentially—its like _Phantom of the Paradise_ meets _The Last Waltz._

* * *

#### 5\. FURIOSA: A MAD MAX SAGA

This epic action picture from visionary director George Miller disappointed at the box office, which is nuts. Its not as intense and contained as 2015’s Mad _Max Fury Road,_ Miller’s previous masterpiece, but its not supposed to be—the story takes place over 30 years. Leads Anna Taylor Joy and Chris Hemsworth are awesome, and oh, man that big screen action. An early wide screen shot of an apocalyptic convoy made me lean over to my dad and whisper, “Its like _Lawrence of Arabia!_ ” I think this one will grow in acclaim with time.

* * *

#### 6\. THE FIRST OMEN

I was just about to write up _Inside Out 2_ in the six spot, then I streamed _The First Omen_ on Hulu. What a surprise! No one asked for a prequel to _The Omen_ (1976) in 2024, but horror fans are lucky they made it anyway. I watched this from 1–3 a.m. on a weeknight, and could not even turn it off, right though the hellzapoppin’ final act. One interesting note: my Hulu account allows for commercial interruptions. Early in the film, there is a hallucinatory demon birth scene and its pretty graphic. Immediately following the money shot, Hulu cut to a Charmin ad, featuring animated bears that love top shelf toilet paper.

* * *

#### 7\. MAXXXINE

Hold on another minute, _Inside Out 2._ Just watched writer-director Ti West’s delicious grindhouse bon bon, the third film in a trilogy that jumps from 1979 (_X_) to 1918 (_Pearl_) to 1985 (_Maxxxine_). The sum of these three parts is amazing, especially when considering at the gonzo performances Mia Goth brings to each film. _Maxxxine_ feels like a movie I would have watched a friend’s house at a sleepover sometime after midnight, a slasher film with bursts of graphic violence on Hollywood Boulevard, a visit to the Bates Motel on the Universal lot, maybe the greatest ZZ Top needle drop in film history, and a New Coke can rolling out of a soda machine. Kevin Bacon is a despicable villain working for a malevolent boss, just one of many terrific character actors making the most out of the film’s modest budget and major aspirations.

* * *

#### 8\. INSIDE OUT 2

OK, here we are. _Inside Out 2_ is another of those beautifully animated, smartly written Pixar films that makes a billion dollars worldwide. This one is a terrific sequel about the inner emotions of a teenage girl in San Francisco. runs out of a bit of steam in the final act. Its still a solid effort from the Emeryville animation powerhouse.

* * *

#### 9\. CIVIL WAR

Alex Garland (_Ex-Machina, Annhilation, Men_) is back with this cautionary tale about a near future United States hobbled by a violent war that has divided the nation. Uncomfortably (possibly) prescient, the film features the most frightening scene of the year, featuring Jesse Plemons as a diabolical military member, and that’s all I will say for now. I can’t wait for Garland’s upcoming collaboration with Danny Boyle, _28 Years Later,_ the third film in their terrifying zombie outbreak series.

* * *

#### 10\. LATE NIGHT WITH THE DEVIL

The final satanic entry in my best of list, this low budget indie is a ton of fun, a “found footage” tale about a 1970s late night talk show host who attempts to contact the devil live on air as a ratings stunt. Most of the fun is in the ’70s texture of the piece, and the slam-bang finale will play well with cult audiences on cable for years to come.
