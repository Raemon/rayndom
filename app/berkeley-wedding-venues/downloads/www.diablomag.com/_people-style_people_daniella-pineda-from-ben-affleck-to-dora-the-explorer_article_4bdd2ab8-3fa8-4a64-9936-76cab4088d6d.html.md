Dora the Explorer has been going on adventures with her monkey pal, Boots, and her purple talking backpack for 25 years—educating and inspiring children all over the world. The young explorer, who speaks a mix of English and Spanish, was Nickelodeon's first Latina cartoon star, but a new live-action feature film sees the spunky heroine aged up to 16 and facing off against a devious character played by Oakland's Daniella Pineda.

In _Dora and the Search for Sol Dorado_ —which starts streaming on Paramount+ and Nickelodeon on July 2—Pineda portrays archaeology legend Camila the Crusader.

“Camila was Dora's hero,” says Pineda, who now lives in Los Angeles. “[Dora has always dreamed of] working with her and then once she gets the opportunity, she realizes Camila might not be all good.”

Dora (Samantha Lorraine) and her friends are searching the Amazonian jungle for the ancient treasure of Sol Dorado and find that being an explorer is not as clear-cut as it may seem.

“I think I'm also a test of character for Dora,” adds Pineda of her character. “Dora in the story is very young, hopeful, and a little naive, and when she finally gets what she wants, she realizes that the world is a little ugly, dangerous, and scary. [She must ask herself], _how do I maintain my good nature and still move forward?_ ”

Filming the movie in Colombia was an adventure unto itself, with one of the young stars getting stung by a scorpion.

“There were bats in my hotel room. We were really in the jungle,” says Pineda. “I loved shooting this movie. It was an all-Latino cast. This is the first time I've ever gotten to be part of a project like that.”

Pineda, who also costarred with Ben Affleck in _The Accountant 2_ this spring, is best known for her roles in the _Jurassic World_ franchise, Netflix’s adaptation of _Cowboy Bebop,_ and _The Originals_ TV series.

“This was my very first kids’ movie, which was a little intimidating,” says Pineda. “I'm so used to being in projects for adults and teenagers, and this was a total change for me. And also, l had just shot _The Accountant 2,_ which could not be more different. It was nice to be a part of something wholesome.”
