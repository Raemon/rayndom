### Barebottle Opening Saturday

[**Barebottle Brewing Company**](https://www.barebottle.com/walnut-creek-taproom-coming-soon) cofounder **Michael Seitz** told us last week that the brewery’s newest taproom is close to launching in Walnut Creek. And now it appears we have confirmation, as the award-winning San Francisco operation [revealed on its Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/DQK30KQkqqm/) that it would be holding its official opening at 1375 South California Boulevard this Saturday, November 1. The IG video offers a peek inside the new taproom, which does indeed look to have a “brewery chic” feel with an open layout, natural light, touches of stainless steel and warm wood, and concrete floors. It also looks like there are a few arcade games along one wall, a possible nod to the space’s former tenant, Pinky’s Pizza and Pub. And in another echo of Pinky’s, Barebottle’s food menu will be anchored by pizza, in this case Detroit-style square pies courtesy of San Francisco’s Joyride Pizza. The main draw, of course, will be beer, and the new Walnut Creek location will have an impressive 40 taps pouring a rotating selection of Barebottle beers, plus wine, cider, and kombucha. Keep an eye on their Instagram for updates on opening day festivities.

### Stereo 41 Tuning Up in Downtown

Details for [**Stereo 41**](https://www.stereo41.com) in downtown Walnut Creek have remained fairly hush-hush up until now. But the lid is finally starting to lift on the anticipated restaurant/bar and hi-fi lounge concept from **Victor Ghaben** and **Berk Gibbs** of World Famous Hotboys and **Sofia Ghaben-Sabet** (Victor’s sister) and her husband, **Helmy Sabet,** of nearby Lita. An opening date has been announced for November 15, and the exterior facade—slowly unveiled over recent weeks—emits a distinctly flashy Miami feel with a whitewashed palette accented by touches of gold, pink, and black. Meanwhile, the partners revealed some inside details in a recent [preview](https://www.sfchronicle.com/food/restaurants/article/stereo-41-walnut-creek-ghaben-gibbs-21102817.php) in the _San Francisco Chronicle._ Some highlights:

\- The food program will be Middle Eastern with Japanese influences and be led by **Jonathan de la Torre,** formerly sous chef at San Francisco’s Michelin-starred Moroccan restaurant Mourad.

\- The cocktail program will also balance Middle Eastern (spices and teas) and Japanese (shochu highballs) elements and be led by **Francisco Carranza,** previously of Oakland cocktail bar Viridian.

\- Ghaben and Gibbs (both former DJs and music producers) are looking to create a lively, party-like atmosphere with a state-of-the-art audio setup and rotating lineup of live DJs.

Stay tuned for more details in the next couple of weeks.

That’s not the only thing happening in downtown Walnut Creek, which is a hub of activity after a string of high-profile closures earlier this year that included SanDai Nusantara Californian, Opa! Authentic Greek, and Walnut Creek Yacht Club. The **Ghaben family,** the veteran restaurant clan behind such successful Contra Costa County projects as Broderick, Lita, and Batch and Brine, took over the Walnut Creek Yacht Club space, where they are planning an ambitious new project sometime next year. **WC Kitchen and Bar** took over the Opa! space and celebrated its official [grand opening](https://www.instagram.com/p/DQFTWyCkpWP/) last Friday with a ribbon cutting, live music, and champagne. [**Ruby Lou’s Boujee Bites and Games**](https://www.instagram.com/rubylouswalnutcreek/) is aiming to launch by the end of the year in the former Buon Vino wine bar space. Longtime San Francisco mixologist and Walnut Creek resident **Megan Benshalom** is heading the colorfully maximalist project that will function as a kid-friendly space in the daytime before morphing into a parent-friendly bar and restaurant in the evening. (Working tagline: “Family by day—fabulous by night!”) Look for more details on that fun concept in the coming weeks. Not one but _two_ popular ramen restaurants are expected to be opening next year: **Marufuku Ramen,** which will take over the former Extreme Pizza space on Cypress Street, and **Mensho,** which is replacing the Essence restaurant on North Main Street. **Calicraft Brewing Co.** is also expected to launch a new rooftop bar and restaurant atop Va de Vi Bistro and Wine Bar in the coming weeks.

### Patxi’s Pizza Closes in Dublin, to Be Replaced by Mendocino Farms?

Once the hot new deep-dish player in town with lively outposts in Lafayette, Livermore, and Dublin, [**Patxi’s Pizza**](https://patxispizza.com) has officially exited the East Bay market after shuttered its last remaining location in Dublin. According to its website, the chain is still operating its flagship restaurant in San Francisco’s Hayes Valley, as well as two in Southern California and one in Hawaii. The good news for East Bay diners is that all the shuttered Patxi’s locations seem to have found exciting replacements. Popular all-day brunch specialist the Breakfast Club at Midtown debuted last year in the former Patxi’s on Mt. Diablo Boulevard in Lafayette, and beloved East Bay deep-dish chain Zachary’s Chicago Pizza is in the process of taking over the downtown Livermore location (where they hope to open before the end of the year). And in Dublin, it appears that [**Mendocino Farms**](https://www.mendocinofarms.com) will be taking over the now-vacant space in the Whole Foods Market shopping center at the corner of Hacienda Drive and Dublin Boulevard. The popular upscale sandwich and salad chain recently filed for a beer and wine license for a restaurant at 5130 Dublin Boulevard—the former home of Patxi’s.

### Taru Sushi and Jungdon Katsu Closed After Downtown Danville Fire

A [fire](https://www.kqed.org/arts/13982928/jungdon-katsu-fire-best-tonkatsu-danville-emeryville) in downtown Danville forced the closure of a popular sushi restaurant and the cult-hit tonkatsu operator that were sharing the same space. [**Taru Japanese Sushi and Cuisine**](https://www.tarucuisine.com) and **[Jungdon Katsu](https://www.jungdonkatsu.com/jungdon),** owned and operated by **Joyce Kim,** will be closed indefinitely after a late-night fire on October 20 in the building where her restaurant and several other businesses are housed. Taru has been open for 10 years on East Prospect Avenue, while Kim brought in Jungdon—a Japanese-style fried pork cutlet pop-up that gained popularity during the pandemic—a couple of years ago. The family started a [**GoFundMe**](https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-rebuild-taru-sushi-and-jungdon-katsu) campaign to raise money to reopen, so consider donating to that. One other silver lining is that they had secured and been working to open a new brick-and-mortar location of Jungdon Katsu in Emeryville—a process they will now fast-track and hope to launch in the next two months. In the meantime, you can still enjoy Kim’s crackly-crispy-crusted tonkatsu via takeout in Emeryville.

### Small Bites From Around the East Bay

We reported recently that **Osaka Marketplace** was planning to open a new location in Pleasant Hill. A recent press release from Downtown Pleasant Hill reveals that the store will be a whopping 42,000 square feet and is aiming to launch in November of 2026.

Local institution **Kasper’s** [closed](https://www.sfgate.com/food/article/95-years-bay-areas-kaspers-hot-dogs-closed-21116547.php) its last two restaurants in Oakland and Concord, ending a nearly 100-year hot dog run in the East Bay. Caspers (with a “C”), the sister hot dog restaurant run by members of the same family, remains open with five East Bay locations. 

It looks like **Crepes Ooh La La** has closed in downtown Walnut Creek after a 15-year run on Locust Street.

Michelin-starred San Francisco chef **Dominique Crenn,** who briefly opened a doomed project in the Claremont Resort and Club and shuttered her new Paris concept after just a year, is [launching](https://www.sfgate.com/food/article/sf-dominique-crenn-texas-hotel-restaurant-21114238.php) a new restaurant in … Fredericksburg, Texas. She’ll run the flagship restaurant inside the city’s Waldorf Astoria hotel.
