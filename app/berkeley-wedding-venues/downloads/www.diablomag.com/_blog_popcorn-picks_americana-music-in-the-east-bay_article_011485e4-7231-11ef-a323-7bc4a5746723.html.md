Fall is in the air and so is Americana music in Northern California, as some top folk rock acts are set to perform nearby.

On Saturday, September 14, The Jayhawks are schedule to perform at Livermore’s Bankhead Theater. The Jayhawks have been one of the great American bands of the past four decades, since creating some of the most significant alt-country albums of the early 1990s, _Hollywood Town Hall_ and _Tomorrow the Green Grass,_ while also providing vocal support on the East Bay band Counting Crows’ smash _August and Everything After._ The band would go on to deliver seminal records such as _Sound of Lies, Smile,_ and _Rainy Day Music._ Over the past decade, The Jayhawks’ albums _Paging Mr. Proust, Backroads and Abandoned Motels,_ and _XOXO_ have been consistently great, featuring soulful songwriting while discovering new sounds and textures with each release.

As great as their discography has been, the real joy of The Jayhawks’ music can be discovered in the band’s live shows. Saturday’s show at the Bankhead marks their first visit to the Tri-Valley in what will be an unforgettable night of great music.

On September 21, guitarist Chris Shifflett will take the night off from his regular gig as guitarist for the wildly popular rock band Foo Fighters to play songs from his outstanding solo album _Lost at Sea_ at the charity concert series Meet Me in Murphys. The benefit was organized by Danville couple Pamela and Kent Donahue, local music lovers who built a stage on their property in Murphy’s, CA, to host concerts that assist a range of causes in Northern California. Shiflett’s show will support a documentary film, Racing on the Spectrum, which follows three young adults with Autism as they pursue dreams of auto racing, as well as Watch Resources, a facility that assists adults with physical and developmental disabilities.

This intimate concert is certain to provide a unique experience for a great cause. [Click here](https://www.meetmeinmurphys.com/) for more information and to purchase tickets.
