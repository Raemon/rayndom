Kija Lucas’s _Untitled_ (Magnolia), 2021, is part of a new exhibit at Mills College Art Museum.

Kija Lucas Photography

To celebrate its 100th anniversary, Mills College Art Museum is presenting a pair of photography exhibits that showcase two of the museum’s greatest strengths: its long-standing role as a creative home for contemporary artists and the depth of its permanent collection.

The museum commissioned Oakland photographer Kija Lucas to create images of botanical subjects that explore how we view nature. “My work sort of visually mimics scientific imagery,” she says. “I am interested in why we classify things, and why people consider some plants beautiful and want to eradicate others. I’m also interested in how we think of plants in terms of native and invasive, which mirrors how we often talk about people.”

Nearly all the plants featured in _Kija Lucas: Hidden Histories_ (on view through April 27) can be found at the college, says Lucas, who earned her MFA at Mills in 2010 and is now an adjunct professor. “There are areas on campus that feel really wild, but people decided those plants should be here,” she says. “To me, those choices are part of the history of the place.”

Mills College history is also explored in _Photography and the Specimen,_ a selection of photographs from the permanent collection that includes works by Imogen Cunningham, Ansel Adams, Dorothea Lange, and others (on view through March 23). Curated by Sarah Miller, a former professor of art history at Mills, the show looks at the notion of a “specimen” as an object that represents a larger group of people, places, or things.

“The show illustrates how photography is always toggling back and forth between scientific documentation and art,” Miller says. _[mcam.mills.edu](http://mcam.mills.edu)._
