**The Pearl Awards are judged by a panel of marketing executives, academics, journalists, designers, corporate strategists and publishers across the United States.**

Walnut Creek, CA–Diablo Custom Publishing (DCP) has been selected as a finalist for two Pearl Awards from the Content Council (CC). DCP was selected as a finalist in the Best Cover, Business-to-Consumer category for _UC Hastings College of the Law_ and in the Best Tablet Content category for El Camino Hospital Health Beat’s tablet magazine.

_UC Hastings College of the Law_ magazine is intended to inform alumni, students, prospective students and faculty about UC Hastings’ accomplishments, activities, and events, and to build a cohesive sense of community to inspire alumni and others to support the law school.

The El Camino Hospital Health Beat tablet magazine is targeted to patients and prospective patients in the surrounding hospital area. Health Beat was created to raise awareness of and affinity for its brand in the minds of health care consumers and practitioners. The app provides the latest information on medical advances, wellness advice and hospital services in an innovative, tech savvy and interactive environment.

"Our design team continually creates high-quality graphic design services to produce custom magazines for a variety of companies and industries."

The Pearl Awards celebrate the best in custom media, design, editorial, digital content and strategic initiatives for business-to-business and business-to-consumer publications. Finalists were selected from over 600 entries from 15 countries. The awards ceremony will be held November 11, 2014, in New York City.
