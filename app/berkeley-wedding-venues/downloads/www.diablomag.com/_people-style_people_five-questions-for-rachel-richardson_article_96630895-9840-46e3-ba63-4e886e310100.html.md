Lisa Beth Anderson

As wildfires have ravaged California, acclaimed poet Rachel Richardson saw the smoke they left behind—literal and metaphorical—showing up in her writing. In _Smother,_ her third full-length poetry collection released earlier this year, the Berkeley native explores the intersections between the climate crisis, motherhood, and grief. Richardson is a professor, National Endowment for the Arts fellow, and cofounder of Berkeley’s Left Margin Lit.

#### “Poetry is my most direct way of conveying both the story and the subject I’m trying to address, as well as the emotional intensity attached to it.”

##### —Rachel Richardson

* * *

#### Q: What does poetry allow you to do as a writer?

**A:** I knew I wanted to be a writer from the time that I became a fluent reader. … When I discovered poetry, it was the musical sense of it that appealed to me. Poetry is my most direct way of conveying both the story and the subject I’m trying to address, as well as the emotional intensity attached to it.

#### Q: _Smother_ delves into topics such as California’s fires, COVID-19, and motherhood. What do you hope readers take away from the collection?

**A:** I’m really trying to write about a collective experience that a lot of Californians had. The first poem in the book is about the day in 2020 when the sky stayed orange. That is a day that [everyone] in the greater Bay Area knows where they were. I’m trying to reflect that.

#### Q: You became a certified wildland firefighter after completing the book. What did you gain from that training?

**A:** Learning about fire is empowering, but it also makes you feel much more connected to the place that you live, because you do learn a lot—not just about reducing fuel for fires, but also the ecology of the place where we live and its historical state before we started managing it in ways that actually made it less sustainable.

#### Q: How has the East Bay influenced your work?

**A:** I live in the same neighborhood where I grew up, which has given me this lens on how it’s changed and how my children’s experience is different than mine. But also, I just love Berkeley. Berkeley has such an incredible love for and seriousness about art and a humanist way of looking at the world.

#### Q: What is your ideal day in the East Bay?

**A:** I would start out on a Sunday morning and go on a run up Marin [Avenue] and around by the [Berryman] Reservoir and back down through Kensington. And then I’d stroll through the Kensington farmers market and maybe go to one of our great cafés, like Caffè Strada.
