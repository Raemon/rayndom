![Survivor](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAQAAAADCAQAAAAe/WZNAAAAEElEQVR42mM8U88ABowYDABAxQPltt5zqAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)

Robert Voets/CBS

Kevin Leung’s initial experience with _Survivor_ was a confusing one. Growing up in Fremont, the Livermore finance manager, who competed in the most recent season of the CBS reality show, wasn’t allowed to watch much TV. The first time he saw the show was with the sound off and his sleeping father beside him—a viewing scenario he repeated for a couple of years. It wasn’t until he witnessed Yul Kwon (who is also from the East Bay) on _Survivor: Cook Islands_ in 2006 that he truly fell in love with the show. Although his stint on the series was fairly short-lived (he was voted off at the end of the second episode), he considers the experience a valuable one.

* * *

#### “It was a tough experience and a very rewarding one. I can wake up every day knowing I did it; I played _Survivor._ ”

##### —Kevin Leung

* * *

#### Q: What made you audition for the show?

**A:** I was always a fan of _Survivor_ and imagined it would be cool to play one day, but I never had confidence that a guy like me [could do it]. Then there was the David vs. Goliath season. I really felt connected to the Davids. They were book-smart and street-smart and had the social savviness to work together.

#### Q: How did you prepare for _Survivor_?

**A:** I tried to bulk up for the challenges … and surrounded myself with [loved ones]. I wanted to be constantly reminded that I have good friends and family. I didn’t want to think that this [was] the only thing happening in my life. No matter if what happened was good or bad, I didn’t want to be so affected by it afterward.

#### Q: What was your most consequential takeaway from your adventure?

**A:** My biggest takeaway is that I heavily underestimate myself—and have probably done so my entire life. Growing up in an immigrant household, with my parents being a little tough on me, I stayed humble. I can be proud of myself and the things I’ve done. It was a tough experience and a very rewarding one. I can wake up every day knowing I did it; I played _Survivor._

#### Q: What’s your perfect Tri-Valley day?

**A:** There is a coffee shop in Livermore called Story Coffee Co. I love it. I go there, do some work, and talk with the locals. On Sundays, I go to the Livermore Farmers Market. A perfect day is coffee, the farmers market, and afternoon wine tasting at Wente Vineyards. I have so much love for the East Bay.

#### Q: Who inspires you?

**A:** My dad. I thought about him every day when I was on _Survivor._ I just wanted to make him proud. He inspires me because he has gone through a lot of adversity and challenges in life, but he has always held his head high and gave me the motivation to be a better person. At the end of the journey, I would totally call it a _Survivor_ win if my dad and mom see me and say, “That’s our son.”
