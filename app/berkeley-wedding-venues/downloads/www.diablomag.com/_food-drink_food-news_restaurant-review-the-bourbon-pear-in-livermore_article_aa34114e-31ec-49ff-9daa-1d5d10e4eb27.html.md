Rodney Worth’s latest eatery channels Southern cuisine.

Sara Cooper, One Love Photography

Rodney Worth points to a specific bite that led him to fall in love with Southern cuisine.

“One of the best things I ever ate was served out of a Crock-Pot at a bar behind Bourbon Street,” he recalls. “It was a bowl of red beans and rice for $4, and it was so good, I can’t even describe it.”

Worth’s version at the Bourbon Pear in Livermore is a little more elevated than that, using beans from Napa’s Rancho Gordo and Carolina Gold rice grown in South Carolina as a base for an enormous ham hock braised to fall-apart tenderness. But at its heart, this is the kind of straightforward comfort food—fork off some meat, mix with rice and beans, repeat—that most anyone can get behind. That’s especially true at a price tag of $26 for a generous portion that could easily serve two.

The irrepressible Danville chef seems to have found his sweet spot in Livermore, where the city’s unpretentious cowboy roots pair well with Worth’s penchant for indulgent, meat-forward fare. Other crowd-pleasers on the menu include short ribs, lamb shank, a Nashville-style fried chicken sandwich, and fillet tip salad with blue cheese dressing. Rest assured you won’t leave the Bourbon Pear hungry—but that’s not to say Worth can’t do subtle.

![DM2505_060_DIG.jpg](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAQAAAADCAQAAAAe/WZNAAAAEElEQVR42mM8U88ABowYDABAxQPltt5zqAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)

The restaurant serves a variety of down-home favorites.

The smoked tomato soup perfectly balances elements of sweet, savory, tart, and creamy, while the fried hush puppies offer a pillowy soft interior contrasted by a crispy exterior and tasty side of cinnamon honey butter. The shrimp and grits is a winner, packing a ton of flavor via bouncy white prawns atop supergarlicky cheddar cheese grits spiked with bacon, tomatoes, and corn. We actually could have done without the last two ingredients, which tended to mask the flavor of those tasty grits.

Indeed, our only quibble with the Bourbon Pear’s menu was a tendency to overload the dishes. But that’s something that comes with the territory with Worth, a maximalist in spirit who has opened more restaurants over his 20-plus-year career than there are toppings on his half-pound Rodzilla Burger (cheddar, bacon, crispy onions, lettuce, tomatoes, and barbecue sauce, for the record).

Still, the Bourbon Pear appears to be one of Worth’s most mature, restrained projects. While the concept is Southern, he doesn’t overdo it. The flexible menu offers plenty of off-theme favorites from his flagship Peasant and the Pear and Peasant’s Courtyard restaurants, such as a pear quesadilla. The lunch crowd can enjoy a hearty selection of salads, sandwiches, and burgers; the dark-toned interior is upscale enough for a date night but casual enough for families.

The whiskey-and-bourbon-stocked bar provides a great perch to dine solo or catch a game with friends. (Worth says the Livermore crowd is decidedly cocktail-heavy versus his wine-centric clientele in Danville.) The restaurant exudes an easy, user-friendly vibe that suits its setting, which was all part of the plan.

“This business is very finicky, and I’ve definitely learned a lot, especially coming out of COVID,” he says. “We’ve tried to go back to the basics: Give people what they want—not what you think they want—and then put your own flair on it.”

So far, the Bourbon Pear seems to be fulfilling that mission nicely in Livermore, where, with Southern charm, it’s slid comfortably into the city’s First Street restaurant row. _[rodneyworth.com/location/the-bourbon-pear](http://rodneyworth.com/location/the-bourbon-pear)._
