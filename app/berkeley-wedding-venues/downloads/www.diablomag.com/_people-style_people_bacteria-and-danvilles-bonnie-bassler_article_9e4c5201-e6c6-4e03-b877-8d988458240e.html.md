Like many innovative thinkers, molecular biologist Bonnie Bassler began with a question: How do bacteria get any bang for their buck? “They are so small,” she says. “How can they kill us or keep us alive?”

That query, postulated some 34 years ago as part of her postdoctoral project, led Bassler on a scientific journey that has brought new understanding about communication among bacteria. Her groundbreaking discoveries also earned the Monte Vista High School graduate an impressive list of prestigious awards, including the National Medal of Science, which she received in January.

Bassler is the chair of the Department of Molecular Biology, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator, and the Squibb Professor in Molecular Biology at Princeton University in New Jersey. She discovered a passion for science while taking biology, chemistry, and biochemistry classes at UC Davis when she was studying to become a veterinarian. She joined a professor’s lab project on bacteria and has been working with the single-celled organisms ever since.

“I fell in love with bacteria—how versatile they are,” she says. “They are model systems for many different life processes.”

Over her long career, Bassler has served on the National Science Board during the Obama Administration, worked with the National Institutes of Health, and helped foundations apportion grant money to the projects of young scientists, among other endeavors.

She frequently visits her family in the East Bay—her father lives in Dublin, and her brother and sister-in-law reside in Pleasanton—and continues to be amazed by how the area has evolved.

“When I lived in Danville, people had horses in their front yards,” says Bassler. “Now I don’t even recognize Danville or any other nearby towns.”

Bassler spoke with _Diablo_ about her research and the privilege of working in science.

* * *

#### Q: You’ve been called the bacteria whisperer. Can you explain your work in lay terms?

**A:** My lab showed that bacteria—the world’s most ancient organisms—communicate with chemical words. Bacteria recognize that when the group does something together, they can accomplish tasks that they could never accomplish as individuals because individually, each bacterium is too small to make a difference. We showed that bacteria make and release small molecules.

The more cells there are, the more molecules there are around them. When the molecules accumulate to a sufficient amount, the bacteria detect the presence of the molecules and infer that neighboring cells are present. In unison, all the bacteria change their behavior and begin to carry out tasks as a collective, succeeding because billions of bacteria are performing the tasks together. We call this quorum sensing.

We know that many clinically relevant bacteria cannot be pathogens without quorum sensing. If you get infected by a few bacterial cells, and they dribble out some toxins or poisons, it is irrelevant. You are enormous, and the bacteria are tiny; your immune system fights them off. But if the bacteria all release their toxins and poisons together, they can overwhelm the immune system and have devastating effects. In the microbiome, bacteria also act in groups to make us healthy.

* * *

#### Q: What are the applications of your findings?

**A:** For bacteria to be successful as pathogens, they have to act as groups. We’ve made quorum-sensing interference molecules that shut down the bacterial lines of communication, and these are being developed into medicines. We’ve also made pro-quorum-sensing molecules to aid beneficial bacteria to do their jobs more effectively, for example, in bioremediation. Manipulating quorum sensing shows promise for applications in medicine, industry, and ecology. Most recently, we’ve shown that viruses tune into bacterial quorum-sensing conversations and so do cells in higher organisms, such as human cells. We are interested in the mechanisms underlying these newly discovered cross-domain communication interactions and are trying to make more applications.

It’s still a really young field, and there is a treasure trove of discoveries waiting to be made. I won’t make them, but maybe the members of my lab who come after me will.

* * *

#### Q: What inspires you?

**A:** I always have around 10–12 undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral trainees in my lab. It’s collaborative and so much fun. My team has been inspiring me all these years. [Our] job is to have ideas that no one in the universe has ever had before. That’s a great job! We’re adventurers. It is a privilege to be a scientist and get to make discoveries, and it is a challenge. We get to use our imaginations and try to change how people think about the natural world.

* * *

#### Q: Do you feel a responsibility as a female thought leader in science?

**A:** I think it’s important to recognize that we can be ourselves and not the stereotype of a female scientist. It’s a great time to be a woman in science. The field is open to us because of many pioneering women who are a generation older than I am and who paved the way, but I hope I can do my part to keep that going.

#### Q: What are your standout honors?

**A:** In 2002, I won a MacArthur [Fellowship]. I was just starting this work; it was considered fringe science, and I was considered a quack. Then I got this prize out of the blue, and it put me—and my field—on the map. That was a real game changer.

Getting the National Medal of Science was incredibly moving. It was remarkably poignant to be among the set of scientists making the case, in a last-gasp effort, that science is important for society one week before the inauguration [of President Donald Trump]. The scientist hosts at the ceremony made beautiful speeches about what science has done for democracy and the lives of Americans. I went with my husband and my kid brother, who lives in the East Bay (and is not a scientist). It was wonderful to watch the event through my brother’s eyes. The event was so much more moving than I anticipated; it was very memorable.
