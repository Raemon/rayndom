Diablo magazine honored nine recipients for its annual [Threads of Hope Awards](http://www.diablomag.com/Diablo-Magazine/December-2011/2011-Threads-of-Hope-Portfolio/ "Threads link 2011"). Robert Pack of Danville, from the Troy and Alana Pack Foundation; Dave and Lori Sanson of Walnut Creek, for HomeAid of Northern California; Lou Bordisso, of Vallejo, an advocate with early-onset Alzheimer's disease; and Janet Herman, of Alamo, for the All-Star swim program. Threads of Hope Honoree Cancer Crusaders included Bob Hammer, of Danville, with Have a Ball Foundation; Sandra J.

All recipients were honored for their contributions to the East Bay community at a reception on December 5 at the Orinda Theatre. In addition to the awards event, the honorees and their organizations were be featured in the December issue of Diablo magazine.

For the past 19 years, Diablo has solicited nominations for exceptional volunteers who give their time to charitable causes in the East Bay for the annual Threads of Hope Awards. After considering each nominee’s length of service, hands-on involvement, and impact on the community, a panel of judges representing East Bay businesses and philanthropic organizations chose five honorees.

The 2013 panel of judges were Stephen Lesher, vice president, Dean and Margaret Lesher Foundation; Jessica Aguirre, NBC Bay Area’s news anchor and host of Class Action, a weekly show focused on improving the state of education in California; Mark Flower, senior vice president and regional director of Wells Fargo Private Bank; Amy MacEwen, marketing and advertising manager, Oakland Athletics; and Carole Wynstra, vice president of marketing, Walnut Creek Library Foundation, and past president of Diablo Theatre Company.
