When longtime Pleasanton resident John Madden passed away on December 28, 2021, he left behind a legacy as a Pro Football Hall of Fame coach for the National Football League (NFL)—including for the then–Oakland Raiders—a famed broadcaster, a frequent commercial pitchman, the name behind the _Madden NFL_ video game series, and a beloved family man and neighbor. 

His stamp on the East Bay continues to be felt today, thanks to charitable support and local businesses run by his sons, Mike and Joe Madden. The latter is the executive producer of Goal Line Studios, a virtual and live production studio in Pleasanton that recently partnered with Pac-12 Enterprises on its pregame and halftime shows. Joe Madden spoke with _Diablo_ about collaborating with the college football conference during its rebuilding year—it currently has only two member schools but will expand to more next year—his father’s love of the Tri-Valley, and what’s ahead for the studio that John built.

* * *

#### **Q: What can you share about the origins of Goal Line Studios?**

**A:** I was on the Madden bus with my dad for two years after graduating from Brown University. … During those travels, we came up with the idea of Goal Line because he wanted to be home after the football season was over. He didn’t want to go to Los Angeles or New York to do a commercial. In the 1980s and ’90s, he was one of the top celebrity endorsers of the day. I said, ‘Dad, if you build this stage, I’ll bet you the producers and directors will come to you.’ We built a smaller stage in ’92 in Pleasanton but in a different location from where we are now. He quickly outgrew it, so we built a new one in our current location in 1995; we’ve been there now for 30 years.

It was my dad’s place, and I was just assisting where I could, building my own little business that migrated into corporate videos [including for Shapell Properties]. … In 2017, as my dad was getting older, I spent a lot of my time going to lunch with him and helping when needed. For four years, I concerned myself with my dad’s care, and that was pretty much my career until he passed away. That was hard; it’s still hard.

I really questioned what I was going to do next. Goal Line was always my dad’s home away from home, and we had two towers of 70-inch plasmas, four screens on one tower, four screens on another, and a nine-by-16-foot projection screen. That’s just how my dad watched all his NFL games after he retired; it was our family room on Sundays, and we would get together, watch football, and have big meals. He still has his spot reserved there, and we honor him every Sunday.

#### **Q: What led to the studio renovation in 2023?**

**A:** About a year after my dad passed, we had tech company CEOs come in to do virtual keynotes. They would bring in LED [video] walls, set them up, do the shoot, and then tear [everything] down. … I thought it was interesting what you could do with the LED walls and started looking into them. … I thought, _why don’t we build a permanent one?_ It turned out to be one of the largest LED walls in the country for an independent studio, and we went online in March 2023.

Keynotes have been our bread and butter. Our first client after we built the LED wall was Snowflake, which [has an office] in Dublin. We’ve done commercials—the most recent one was [San Francisco 49ers quarterback] Brock Purdy’s Toyota spot. … The agency wanted to take generative AI imagery as far as they could. They did a great job. It was a great use of the technology. … We’ve done a lot of car spots and other commercials, live-streamed events, and music videos. 

#### **Q: Now you are working with the Pac-12 Conference. How did that happen?**

**A:** I got a call from a producer who is an independent contractor and worked for Pac-12. This was prior to them losing 10 schools. Instead of the Pac-12, they became the Pac-2. A month later, [the deal] happened. Michael Molinari at Pac-12 Enterprises saw it as a great opportunity. Here’s this 100-year-old conference that’s now a start-up but has such great tradition and a fan base. Their studio is in San Ramon, their equipment is amazing and state-of-the-art, but their studio was maybe 25 feet wide and 30 feet long. We’re 6,000 square feet. … They are doing pregame and halftime shows. It’s the discovery season because we’re [figuring out] what makes sense or what we can do better. Virtual production is about as new as you can get, especially where live sports is concerned. 

Not to be cliché, but my dad is definitely smiling from above. I know he’s happy that we have sports back at Goal Line. … And to bring it back in this way with Pac-12, it feels right.

#### **Q: What’s ahead for the studio?**

**A:** There’s a lot of things in the preliminary stages that I can’t discuss yet, but it’s very exciting stuff. … One project I am working on would complete the circle my dad started and what he brought to the game of football. He was known for what was called the Telestrator, where you’re drawing the X’s and O’s [on-screen over a play]. That was an idea he had in his first year at CBS Sports because my dad could see all 22 players and what they had done as individuals. … Let’s just say what’s next involves artificial intelligence.

#### **Q: Is your family involved in the John Madden biopic starring Nicolas Cage?**

**A:** No, but we are involved in other projects around my dad and incorporating his legacy that I can’t talk about yet. I’m all for the film though. And Nic Cage, playing my dad? Love him—though he doesn’t look anything like my dad. From what I’ve seen, they have done a pretty good job.

#### **Q: What can you say about your father’s legacy?**

**A:** He cared about this area, and he only touched the things that he really felt comfortable with. Those were sports, the Tri-Valley, and Oakland. I know the Raiders moving to Las Vegas really broke his heart; it broke all of our hearts. The John Madden Foundation gives back to underserved students and student athletes in Oakland and the surrounding areas. … He gave back in so many ways that people don’t know about. I’d love to be able to follow in his footsteps. … That is my focus. For all of the new ventures I’m taking on, [his legacy of giving back] is the most important.
