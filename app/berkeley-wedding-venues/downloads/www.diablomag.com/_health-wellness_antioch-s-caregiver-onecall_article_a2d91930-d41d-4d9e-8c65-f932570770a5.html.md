Caregiver OneCall founder Nikki Lopez (center) and her team offer support to those helping friends and family with unique needs.

There are 63 million family caregivers in the United States, according to a recent joint report from AARP and the National Alliance for Caregiving, a 45 percent jump over the past decade. Whether managing the daily needs of children with medical issues or disabilities or looking after elderly loved ones living with dementia, caregivers deal with numerous challenges that can take a serious toll on their own mental and physical health.

“Caregivers often face isolation, guilt, and exhaustion,” says Nikki Lopez, founder of Antioch-based helpline Caregiver OneCall. “There is also the emotional and the financial strain.”

To help care providers in the East Bay and nationwide, Lopez launched Caregiver OneCall in February, supplying real-time support 24 hours a day. The nonprofit also does caregiving training (virtual and in person), hosts speakers, offers navigation and referrals, and supplies coordination to find respite care, all at no cost. Workshops have covered such topics as dealing with grief while looking after someone else, understanding dementia, and self-care.

“You can ask for advice, vent, scream, whatever it takes. We are a safe space where people won’t be judged,” says Lopez. “We just want caregivers to know that they don’t have to be alone anymore.”

Caregiver OneCall is staffed by trained volunteers—although the helpline doesn’t provide mental health counseling—and has partnered with community agencies including the Alzheimer’s Association, Family Caregiver Alliance, and Antioch Police Department. “If they recognize a caregiver in distress while they are out in the field, they can reach out,” adds Lopez.

Currently, the nonprofit is primarily focused on Contra Costa County, but the helpline has aided callers from around the U.S. Caregiver OneCall is not limited to those helping elderly family members; those caring for children with autism or other complex needs can also use the service.

“Caregiving is love in action, but love without any type of support burns people out,” says Lopez. “You are not alone; lean into systems, neighbors, and friends. Feel whatever you are feeling, and let go of the guilt.” _[caregiveronecall.org](http://caregiveronecall.org)._
