As the year comes to a close, many people reflect on where they are in life relationships, goals, finances, and personal well being. For some, that reflection brings an important realization: it may be time to start preparing for divorce.

While no one enters a marriage expecting it to end, taking a proactive and organized approach can make the transition smoother and less overwhelming. At Mendes Law, PC, our San Francisco Bay Area family law attorneys guide clients through every step of the process, helping them make informed decisions that protect their interests and their future.

If you’re considering divorce as the New Year approaches, this year-end divorce preparation checklist can help you start the process with clarity and confidence.

* * *

### **1\. Review Your Finances**

Financial preparation is one of the most critical steps before filing for divorce. Start by gathering and organizing documents that reflect your financial picture.

**Checklist:**

  * Bank account statements (checking, savings, joint, and individual)

  * Credit card and loan statements

  * Recent pay stubs and tax returns (last 2–3 years)

  * Retirement and investment account statements

  * Mortgage, property tax, and insurance documents




Understanding your financial standing helps your attorney assess marital vs. separate property, identify potential spousal or child support issues, and plan for equitable division.

**Tip:** Make digital copies of all-important financial records and store them securely.

* * *

#### **2\. Track Your Expenses**

Knowing your monthly expenses gives a clear view of your standard of living and financial needs after divorce. Start tracking your spending in categories like:

  * Housing and utilities

  * Groceries and household items

  * Transportation and vehicle costs

  * Childcare, education, and extracurricular activities

  * Medical and insurance expenses




This information will be essential when determining temporary support or long-term financial planning during and after the divorce process.

* * *

#### **3\. Take Inventory of Assets and Debts**

The end of the year is an ideal time to create an updated list of all marital assets and liabilities, including:

  * Real estate (homes, investment properties, land)

  * Vehicles, boats, or recreational equipment

  * Valuable items (jewelry, artwork, collections)

  * Business ownership or partnerships

  * Outstanding loans, credit cards, or lines of credit




Having a complete record early on prevents confusion later and ensures transparency when property division discussions begin.

* * *

#### **4\. Update or Secure Important Documents**

Before filing, make sure you have access to personal identification and legal documents:

  * Birth certificates, passports, Social Security cards

  * Marriage certificate and prenuptial or postnuptial agreements

  * Wills, trusts, and powers of attorney




You may also consider updating beneficiaries on life insurance or retirement accounts if appropriate. Consult with your attorney first to understand any restrictions that apply once a divorce case is filed.

* * *

#### **5\. Consider Living Arrangements**

If you and your spouse are still living together, think about your short- and long-term plans.

  * Will you remain in the home temporarily during proceedings?

  * Can you afford a separate residence?

  * How will you handle shared expenses until the divorce is finalized?




Discussing living arrangements early helps reduce tension and uncertainty later.

* * *

#### **6\. Focus on the Children’s Needs**

If you share children, it’s important to begin thinking about custody schedules and holiday planning well in advance. Keep their best interests at the forefront and document what has worked well in your current routine.

You can also review our related guide: [Creating a Holiday Custody Schedule That Works for Everyone.](https://mendeslawca.com/holiday-custody-schedule-making-a-parenting-plan-that-works-for-everyone/)

A calm, cooperative approach can help minimize the emotional toll on your children and set a positive tone for co-parenting.

* * *

#### **7\. Prioritize Your Emotional Well-Being**

Divorce isn’t just a legal or financial process it’s an emotional one. Before the New Year begins, consider ways to support your mental and emotional health.

  * Lean on friends and family for support.

  * Work with a therapist or counselor.

  * Take time for self-care and reflection.




The emotional clarity you gain will help you make more confident and rational decisions during the legal process.

* * *

#### **8\. Schedule Consultations with Family Law Attorneys**

Even if you’re unsure about moving forward immediately, scheduling a consultation with a trusted Bay Area divorce attorney can help you understand your options.

**A lawyer can:**

  * Explain your rights under California community property law

  * Review your financial situation

  * Advise on timing and strategy

  * Help you prepare necessary documentation




Early guidance from experienced professionals ensures you’re taking the right steps before filing.

* * *

#### **9\. Create a Plan for the New Year**

The end of the year is a natural time for reflection and planning. Set realistic goals for the months ahead personally, professionally, and financially. Whether you decide to file in January or later, having a plan in place gives you control over your next chapter.

* * *

#### **10\. Take the First Step with Mendes Law, PC**
