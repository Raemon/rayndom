Diablo Publications Announces the Launch of The Wedding Book

Diablo Publications brings its first dedicated wedding publication to the San Francisco East Bay.

Walnut Creek, CA—Diablo Publications today announced the launch of Diablo magazine’s The Wedding Book. The new publication will make its debut with a winter edition in mid-December and will publish once every season thereafter. Editorial features will include: venues, fashion, flowers, food, cakes, invites, and the hottest trends from top vendors. Packed with wedding inspirations and aspirations, vendors, and styled shoots, the magazine will be tailored to brides and grooms planning their wedding in the San Francisco East Bay and beyond.

The magazine promises to provide everyone involved with planning a wedding the rich set of tools and contacts she or she need to bring a dream wedding to life. Whether they are seeking an intimate outdoor venue or a sophisticated ballroom event, The Wedding Book will be a great resource to make the special day come true. 

With the success of prior wedding sections in Diablo magazine, Diablo Publications recognized the need for a dedicated publication for its readers and advertisers. Through Diablo’s research, it has determined that couples who live in or travel to the San Francisco East Bay spend between $29,159 and $48,598 on average for their wedding (The Wedding Report, 2014).

"We cannot think of a better community to launch this publication in than the San Francisco East Bay," says Susan Safipour, Editor in Chief for Diablo magazine. "We have a top-notch editorial staff that is passionate and informed about wedding planning, and we can’t wait to share a dedicated wedding book with our audience and advertisers."
