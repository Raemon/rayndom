Pvolve offers research-backed workouts at a new Walnut Creek outpost.

#### BEST CELEBRITY-ENDORSED WORKOUT

**PVOLVE, WALNUT CREEK**

In February, Walnut Creek welcomed the Bay Area’s first Pvolve studio, embracing the company’s functional fitness strength-training philosophy adapted to every participant. The ever-changing workouts are available both virtually and in person, and training sessions target the whole body—developing muscle strength and definition to help mobility, increase longevity, and promote weight loss and a healthy metabolism. Though the classes are geared to a wide audience, in a fitness industry often dominated by men, Pvolve emphasizes women’s health and wellness. And members are in good company: Actress Jennifer Aniston began partnering with Pvolve in 2023 after taking classes for a couple of years. _[pvolve.com](http://pvolve.com)._

#### BEST FULL-BODY REVITALIZATION

**OVRHL, OAKLAND**

Physical health is intertwined with spiritual wellness and strong community connections at OVRHL, which debuted recently in Oakland. The studio offers a wide roster of classes—from Pilates (in hot and mat varieties) to yoga (hatha, yin, vinyasa) to dance fusion sessions. But OVRHL takes holistic health a step further, offering art shows, wellness workshops, off-site creative retreats, and more. OVRHL also makes sure there’s a place for everyone with pay-what-you-can class offerings and sliding-scale memberships. _[ovrhl.com](http://ovrhl.com)._

#### BEST SPORTS BONDING OPPORTUNITY

**CRICKET CHAMPS, PLEASANTON**

The biggest indoor cricket facility in the United States is right here in the Tri-Valley. At Cricket Champs, you can rent cricket lanes for groups as well as bowling machines ideal for perfecting your skills. Guests can also take advantage of the on-site gym, and Cricket Champs has a store for any necessary gear. Plus, the facility runs a thriving after-school program for Pleasanton and Dublin elementary and middle schoolers, where kids can enjoy 90-minute cricket sessions with certified coaches, face off against each other in spirited matches, and even get homework done during independent work time. _[cricketchamps.net](http://cricketchamps.net)._
