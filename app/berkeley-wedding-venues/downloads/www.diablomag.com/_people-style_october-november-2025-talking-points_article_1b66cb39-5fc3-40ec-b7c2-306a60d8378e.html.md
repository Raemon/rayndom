#### Introducing a Future Shoreline Park

The East Bay Regional Park District will get bigger in the coming years after acquiring an 82-acre parcel at Richmond’s Point Molate on the Point San Pablo Peninsula. The $40 million purchase from the Indigenous tribe Guidiville Rancheria of California will preserve the land as a shoreline park and protect its cultural history. Planning and development of the open space will take several years and will add to the 73 parks already in the district. “This is a remarkable milestone for the entire Bay Area,” said the park district’s general manager, Sabrina Landreth, in an announcement of the news in late August.

East Brother Light Station is battling a financial shortfall.

Frank Schulenburg

#### Historic Loss?

One of the East Bay’s most unique lodging options is in trouble. The historic East Brother Light Station, which has watched over the San Francisco and San Pablo bays since 1873 and currently doubles as a bed-and-breakfast, announced an urgent fundraising effort in July. The property is owned by the Coast Guard, which doesn’t have the $750,000 needed to replace the aging pier and gangway that provide the only access to the island. The nonprofit steward organization that operates the East Brother Light Station—using revenue from the restored Victorian inn to maintain the property—is trying to raise the money to keep the B&B and lighthouse open. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, East Brother Light Station has accommodated more than 70,000 guests since 1980, when it was first established as an inn. To date, the fundraising campaign is still thousands of dollars short of its goal.

#### Record-Setting Swim

On a morning in late August, Pleasanton native Catherine Breed set a new record during her 30-mile swim through freezing, rough waters between the Farallon Islands and the Golden Gate Bridge. It is one of the most difficult long-distance swims in the world, and she is the seventh person and third woman to accomplish the feat. The Amador Valley High School graduate, who now lives in Mill Valley, completed the swim in a little under 14 hours, breaking an earlier record set in 2014. Breed swam in the dark during eight hours of her journey, which she found particularly challenging. “This swim tried to break me,” she wrote on Instagram. Her previous endeavors included swimming 60.1 miles around the circumference of Lake Tahoe over five days, crossing Monterey Bay, and swimming the English Channel. In 2026, she will attempt Swim California, a stage-assisted adventure swim that will cover more than 900 miles over the span of three to four months. It will be the first such attempt to swim the entire California coastline.
