#  _Diablo_ Magazine Launches the Second _Lamorinda Book_

##  _The_ Lamorinda Book _will provide a comprehensive overview of Lafayette, Orinda, and Moraga—the cities that make up this region. The book will highlight all that makes the Lamorinda area such a great place to live and visit._

[_Diablo_ magazine](http://www.diablomag.com) announced the release of the second edition of _The Lamorinda Book,_ one of three books in an annual series of publications highlighting the cities and towns of the East Bay. Planned for a January 2014 release, _The Lamorinda Book_ will provide a comprehensive overview of Lafayette, Orinda, and Moraga—the cities that make up this region. _The Lamorinda Book_ is published by Diablo Publications and produced by LeeAnne Jones, managing editor, and Caitlin McCulloch, assistant managing editor.

Editorial coverage will include food and drink, parks, recreation, and city life. _The Lamorinda Book_ will cover each city’s unique offerings as well as some of their common characteristics. The Lamorinda region offers everything from white tablecloth restaurants and museums to the historic Orinda Theatre and the California Shakespeare Theater. The second edition of the _Lamorinda Book_ will feature a new Recreation and Community section, and redesigned personal profile spotlights.

Commenting on the previous _Lamorinda Book_ in the series, Rick Kattenburg, vice president of the Orinda Chamber of Commerce, states, "There’s great information on each town, with very well written write-ups. The restaurant reviews are excellent, and the graphics are superb: It’s one of the best books of this kind I've seen."

"The Lamorinda area is one of the hidden gems in the East Bay," states Barney Fonzi, Group Publisher for Diablo Publications. "The region has so much to offer, and _The Lamorinda Book_ will showcase the best of each city. Our readers have commented that the city books are something they refer to frequently and keep on their coffee tables as a useful reference."

_The Lamorinda Book_ will be available at local travel information venues, hotels, advertiser locations, Chamber of Commerce offices, and at various events throughout the region. It will also be mailed to select homes with _Diablo_ magazine.
