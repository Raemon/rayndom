All Natural Stone marks 25 years of supplying luxury stone and tile to the Bay Area—and recently opened a new Dublin showroom.

#### BEST PLACE TO FINISH STRONG

**ALL NATURAL STONE, BERKELEY AND DUBLIN**

All Natural Stone is a longtime resource for interior designers, architects, and homeowners looking for premiere stone and tile in the Bay Area. This year, the family-owned business celebrated a quarter century of providing quality tile and slab surfaces from around the world. Among the additions to their offerings are handcrafted ceramic tiles and a porcelain slab collection featuring large-format designs and made with advanced manufacturing techniques. All Natural Stone also opened a new showroom in Dublin this year and continues to carry prestigious brands such as Artistic Tile, AKDO, Country Floors, and Walker Zanger. _[allnaturalstone.com](http://allnaturalstone.com)._

#### BEST WAY TO SHOW OFF YOUR HOMETOWN AT HOME

**STUDIO SEVEN ARTS, PLEASANTON**

Decorate your walls while demonstrating regional pride with retro giclées highlighting East Bay locations, available at Studio Seven Arts. The canvas and works on paper from Minnesota artist Steve Thomas are done in the style of vintage travel posters. His work is greatly influenced by the art deco movement of the 1930s and includes pieces depicting Pleasanton, Mount Diablo, Livermore Valley, Oakland, and Lamorinda, among other spots. _[studiosevenarts.com](http://studiosevenarts.com)._

Berkeley’s Vintage Rug Shop offers a wide selection of antique floor coverings, along with furnishings, textiles, and other home goods.

#### BEST SHOP FOR RUGS AND TEXTILES

**THE VINTAGE RUG SHOP, BERKELEY**

The Vintage Rug Shop owner Brittany Chinaglia wants her customers to feel right at home in her Fourth Street store. The shop, which relocated from Temescal to Berkeley in November, sells new and old home goods, including original and made-to-order furnishings—many upholstered with vintage textiles—that are designed at the shop and reflect both history and craft. Shoppers can also peruse pillows and linens, as well as vintage chairs, tables, and rugs in a variety of sizes and price points. “We help customers incorporate the pieces that they already own with the pieces we have on display. The mix of items feels visually comfortable and inviting,” says Chinaglia. “We’re a destination for collected interiors that help people feel like their home is a reflection of themselves and not anything anyone else has.” _[thevintagerugshop.com](http://thevintagerugshop.com)._
