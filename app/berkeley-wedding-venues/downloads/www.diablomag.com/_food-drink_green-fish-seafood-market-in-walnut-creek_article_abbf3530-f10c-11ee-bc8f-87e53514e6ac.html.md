The market sells whole fish, perfect for seafood aficionados.

Cali Godley

Stores jammed together, crowded streets, double-parked trucks and cars—Oakland’s Chinatown is a beehive of activity, with plenty of people going in and out of old-fashioned shops and markets. Big-box stores? Not here—just bins of fruit and vegetables on the sidewalk and aisles filled with spices and the sounds of Asian languages.

Right in the middle of all the action is Green Fish Seafood Market. It’s been there for over a decade, opened by Finnie Phung’s parents, John Phung and Cu Ngay.

Stop by the latest Green Fish location in Walnut Creek.

Now shift gears. The corner of Olympic Boulevard and Tice Valley Boulevard in Walnut Creek is the gateway to Rossmoor. Leafy suburbia is literally a few steps away, and “peaceful” is the operative word.

There, far from the bustling sidewalks of downtown Oakland, you will find the second Green Fish Seafood Market, which opened in December. The small store can’t rely on foot traffic for customers, or nearby neighborhoods filled with Cantonese speakers who want to make sure they take home the head of the lobster as well as the tail. So the first job for the Phungs is to find the balance between an Asian market and a suburban customer base.

“Our customers here want lobster tail,” says Finnie Phung. “Here people don’t want the whole fish. In Oakland, people eat the head, the fins, everything. It’s been a big adjustment for me.”

The market provides vegetables from regional purveyors.

At first glance, the Walnut Creek Green Fish seems like just another small grocery store. There are bins of fruits and vegetables outside, just like at Lafayette’s Diablo Foods, and the aisles of dry goods are surrounded by refrigerated areas.

But a closer look reveals that we’re not at Lunardi’s anymore. The shelves are filled with Chinese, Japanese, and Korean brands, often items that major stores don’t carry.

Eventually, the wandering customer stumbles onto the display of fresh fish, some buried in ice, others presented in more traditional ways. But those large tanks on the wall are not traditional, at least in suburbia, and the tanks are filled with fresh catch.

The market is a colorful addition to the Contra Costa County food scene.

“We don’t like to work with third parties,” says Phung, “because they sell the best pieces to restaurants for higher prices.”

But Phung recognizes that some of her customers don’t know what to do with a whole fish. “So if you want to buy a live lobster,” she says, “we will cut it and clean it for you.”

Green Fish also offers Asian vegetables, brought in from local producers who grow Taiwanese spinach and Chinese bok choy and have been working with Phung’s family for decades.

Green Fish stocks a variety of Asian food products.

Now, though, they’re delivering to the suburbs, a location Phung has been eyeing for a while. “Two years ago, my husband and I knew we had to look to the future. To this day, there’s a lot of anti-Asian violence in Oakland.”

And with suburban diversity on the rise, the move to Walnut Creek seemed like the logical next step—even if adjustments have to be made.
