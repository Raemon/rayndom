Free Range Flower Winery creates unique pours in the Tri-Valley.

Detect some floral notes in that wine? You’re more right than you know.

At her Free Range Flower Winery, Aaliyah Nitoto makes wine by fermenting lavenders, marigolds, roses, and other California-grown flowers to create something completely unique in Livermore wine country. The idea was hatched 15 years ago when Nitoto was studying herbalism and interning in Napa. She discovered that her herbalist clients actually enjoyed recreationally sipping a decanted lavender supplement she had made as a sleep aid. She decided to combine her two passions by tweaking the recipe to make her first flower wine in a small pot in her Oakland kitchen.

“From that, I was able to extract the formulas for my other wines,” she says.

Those include three of her most popular—rose-hibiscus, sparkling lavender, and marigold—which are now available at her new Livermore tasting room, which opened last July. The space also doubles as a production facility, where Nitoto has ramped up to making as many as 1,000 gallons per year emphasizing flavor profiles that are nuanced, balanced, and not overly sweet. She recently came out with a new wine made from jasmine that’s been getting great feedback and hopes to release another created from Senegalese white hibiscus this spring.

“The exciting thing about wine made with flowers is that each flower is a different species with completely different aromatics and flavor profiles,” she says. “So basically, the sky is the limit. If it’s an edible flower, then I can use it.”

 _Free Range Flower Winery is located at 2111 Research Drive, Ste. 6, in Livermore.[freerange​flowerwinery.com](http://freerange%E2%80%8Bflowerwinery.com)._
