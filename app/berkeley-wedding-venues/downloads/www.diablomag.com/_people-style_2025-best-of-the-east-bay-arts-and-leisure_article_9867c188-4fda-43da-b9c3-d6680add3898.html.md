_Sinners,_ written and directed by Oakland’s Ryan Coogler, has earned critical acclaim for its expert storytelling.

#### BEST BEHIND-THE-CAMERA PERFORMANCE

**RYAN COOGLER,_SINNERS,_ OAKLAND**

In _Sinners,_ the label “devil’s music,” a term once affixed to the blues genre, is a literal one. Written and directed by Ryan Coogler, the supernatural horror film, which dropped this spring, follows a young musician in the Jim Crow–era South who unwittingly calls vampires to a juke joint with his music. _Sinners,_ Coogler’s fifth directorial feature film, is simultaneously an allegory for cultural appropriation, an exploration of spirituality and religion, and a celebration of Black music and arts. Coogler told _The New Yorker_ that the idea for the script started to take shape while he was listening to blues songs as he washed dishes at home in Oakland.

#### BEST INCLUSIVE CLASSICAL MUSIC GROUP

**CALIFORNIA SYMPHONY, WALNUT CREEK**

Classical music can be an intimidating genre, but the California Symphony makes it accessible. Each show at the Lesher Center for the Arts features a preconcert talk to give context about the pieces in the program, a photo booth for selfies, and drinks you can sip while you listen to the music. Audiences are invited to clap enthusiastically and have their phones on in silent mode. The symphony also offers a roster of classes and events for various ages, plus an “instrument petting zoo” that allows young ones to have a hands-on experience with trumpets, violins, and more. _[californiasymphony.org](http://californiasymphony.org)._

#### BEST INTERACTIVE HISTORY CLASS

**ROSIE THE RIVETER WWII HOME FRONT NATIONAL HISTORICAL PARK, RICHMOND**

Richmond’s Rosie the Riveter national park, which is celebrating its 25th anniversary in 2025, gives a captivating introduction to life on the home front during World War II, shining a particular spotlight on diverse groups who performed integral tasks that supported troops overseas. At the Visitor Education Center, guests can learn about children’s scrap metal drives, challenges facing African American soldiers, and women who became critical welders and riveters at factories. The park and its nonprofit partner, the Rosie the Riveter Trust, are honoring the milestone with unique programming throughout the year, culminating in a gala planned for October. _[nps.gov/rori](http://nps.gov/rori)._
