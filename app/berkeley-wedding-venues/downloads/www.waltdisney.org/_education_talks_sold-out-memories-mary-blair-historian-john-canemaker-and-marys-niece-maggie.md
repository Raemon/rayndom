### Maggie Richardson

**Margaret (“Maggie”)** **Elizabeth Richardson** was born May 14, 1945, in San Jose, California. She grew up in the small nearby town of Campbell, along with her older sister Jeanne and their parents Peggy and Frank Richardson.

Richardson attended elementary and high school in Campbell, and, as a member of the school Art Honorary Society, prepared for a liberal arts degree at UCLA. However, a part-time job at the UCLA Medical Center redirected her path toward a degree and career in social work. After graduation, she began her calling as a hospital social worker, which would continue throughout both Southern California (UCLA) and Northern California (Stanford University Hospital). Her creative energies, however, found other part-time ways to be expressed: photography, graphic design, and soft sculpture art doll production based on the iconic “moon-faced” children created by her beloved aunt Mary Blair. 

In 2003, Richardson, her sister Jeanne, and their cousin Kevin Blair—Mary’s youngest son—formed a small company with a new website for the purpose of sharing the personal art of Mary Blair and telling her story, along with that of her husband, Lee Blair, and her brother-in-law, Preston Blair.

Sadly, Kevin Blair unexpectedly passed away in 2008, leaving the estates of the three Blairs to Maggie and Jeanne.

Richardson took an early retirement and relocated from Los Angeles to Northern California to be closer to Jeanne as they dealt with the numerous details of the three art estates. The sisters immediately took up where their cousin Kevin left off: assisting Studio Ghibli in the preparation of their Summer 2009 Tokyo exhibition _The Colors of Mary Blair_. The immense success of the Tokyo exhibition and the vast variety of merchandise produced was followed by other exhibits, books, and licensed products, which would keep Maggie and Jeanne busy for several enjoyable years to come.

Sadly, Jeanne passed away in 2023 at the age of 88.

Today, Richardson and her nephew Kevin Allinson (Mary’s great-nephew) continue as the family guardians of Mary Blair’s legacy, continuing to celebrate her gifts to the many fans who love her art, and are inspired by her life. Richardson will soon launch a new online venture—Mary Blair ART WEAR ™️—a new line of “fun” fashion produced exclusively in Los Angeles and available through Mary was known for combining unexpected colors and textures in unique ways and she loved collages. This new project combines pieces of her personal art and designs to create “collage” unisex sweaters and coordinating dog sweaters, in addition to new limited-edition soft sculpture art.
