### Martha Blanding

**Martha Blanding** began her extraordinary run with Disney in May 1971 as Disneyland’s first Black Tour Guide, launching an impressive five-decades-long career at THE HAPPIEST PLACE ON EARTH® in Anaheim, California. She was promoted to VIP Tour Hostess in less than a year, touring legendary entertainment notables and numerous domestic and international dignitaries. Blanding soon became the first Black woman in management at Disneyland, eventually becoming the Senior Manager of Disneyland Resort Merchandise Special Events, where she worked with world-renowned artisans, celebrities, and Disney Legends. Along the way, she helped pioneer and produce the Official Disneyana Convention, a forerunner of today's D23: The Ultimate Disney Fan Experience. She also co-founded PULSE, a Business Employee Resource Group (BERG) centering the experiences of Black Cast Members and employees. Upon her retirement in 2022, Blanding became the first Black woman to achieve a half-century-long career with The Walt Disney Company and was named a Disney Legend in 2024.
