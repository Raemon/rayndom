### About the Speaker

### Bonnie Erickson

**Bonnie Erickson** studied Art and Theatre at the University of Minnesota before moving to New York City to attend the Art Students’ League. While still a student, she created masks and specialty costumes for the stage. Her distinctive style attracted the attention of the late Jim Henson. As Design Director for The Muppets, she created some of the most beloved characters on television. Among the best known are the feisty Miss Piggy and the heckling old men in the balcony, Statler & Waldorf of  _The Muppet Show_.

When Erickson established her own design business, Jim Henson and the production of the  _Fraggle Rock_ series was one of her first design consulting assignments. Another was as a creative director for the product division of  _Sesame Street_ where she oversaw a range of products from clothing to the award-winning Tickle-Me-Elmo doll. Erickson has also developed characters for professional franchises in baseball, basketball, and football. Philadelphia’s Phillie Phanatic—one of the most popular and enduring mascots in all of sports—has joined another of her characters, Montreal Expos’ Youppi!, in the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, NY.

Erickson is a trustee and past president and executive director of The Jim Henson Legacy, a foundation dedicated to preserving and perpetuating Jim Henson’s contributions to the worlds of puppetry, television, motion pictures, special effects, and media technology.
