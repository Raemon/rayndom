This Academy Award® was awarded posthumously to Walt Disney in 1969 for _Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day_ (1968). A sequel to _Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree_ (1966), this featurette was one of the final animated films produced by Walt prior to his death in 1966. The envelope and card announcing the winner of the Academy Award for Short Subjects, Cartoons—a category now known as the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film—was delivered to presenter Tony Curtis by the animated character The Pink Panther. As director of the film, Disney Legend Wolfgang “Woolie” Reitherman (1909–1985) accepted the award, saying in his acceptance speech: “To us who have worked with Walt, this is a very special Oscar. And it’s a memorable moment in all of the moments we’ve all shared with Walt.” Walt Disney holds the record for most Academy Award nominations and won more Oscars than any other individual.
