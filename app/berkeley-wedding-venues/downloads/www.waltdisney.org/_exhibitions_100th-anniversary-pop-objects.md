##  Miniature Vase with Dragon 

#### On view in May 2024.

Walt collected, crafted, and curated a breadth of miniatures, including ceramics, glassware, silver cutlery, paper books and magazines, wooden furniture, musical instruments, dolls, faux fruits, candelabras, checkers and playing cards, and working firearms. This vase—which stands at just one-and-a-quarter inches tall—is finely crafted of porcelain, enamel, and gilding. Some of the hand-painted brushstrokes are the width of a human hair. This is part of a set of miniature porcelain vessels by the same artist, each with a different shape and design.

##  EPCOT Sketches 

#### On view in April 2024.

The centerpiece of Walt’s ambitious plan for Walt Disney World Resort as we know it today was EPCOT—an acronym for Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow—which was to be a master-planned city based on modernist ideas in urban planning. These early concept drawings show Walt’s thinking as he developed ideas for this utopian planned community. This napkin was found—crumpled in the trash—by Walt’s gardener, who stored them in a safe deposit box for many years.

######  December 2023 

##  Margaret Kerry's Ballet Slippers 

#### On view in December 2023. 

Actress and dancer Margaret Kerry (b. 1929) wore this pair of ballet slippers while serving as the live-action reference model for the character of Tinker Bell in  _Peter Pan_(1953).

Since the making of  _Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs_(1937), Disney Studios artists would used live-action references to help capture lifelike motion. Filming human actors—often with costumes and props—allowed animators to study and reproduce the movement of actors’ bodies and clothing in animated form.
