# The Team

Our employees strive to achieve and perpetuate the values Walt held so closely in his work and life: 

  * We are dedicated to the mission of the museum and the vision of Walt Disney. 
  * We believe that a quality experience for visitors is possible only when there is a collaborative desire for a job well done and a “can do” attitude. 
  * We strive for excellence in everything we do. We value the diverse contributions of each individual with respect and without judgment. 
  * We foster an atmosphere of supportive challenge and allow the development of insightful, collaborative, and innovative ideas.



We believe that to achieve the level of quality associated with Walt Disney, each person, as an individual and as part of a cohesive team, contributes to delivering a quality experience to every guest of The Walt Disney Family Museum.
