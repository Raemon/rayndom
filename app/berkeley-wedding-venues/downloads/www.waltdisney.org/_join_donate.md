### "You can dream, create, design, and build the most wonderful place in the world, but it requires people to make the dream a reality."—Walt Disney

Since opening over 10 years ago, we have sought to make the museum a place where our guests could find animation, innovation, and inspiration and immerse themselves in the remarkable life story of Walt Disney—the man who raised animation to an art, tirelessly pursued innovation, and created a distinctly American legacy, transforming the entertainment world. Donations help ensure future generations will continue to be inspired by Walt Disney’s life and legacy by supporting the museum’s unique galleries, special exhibitions, public programs, and educational efforts. 

The Walt Disney Family Museum is a nonprofit, 501(c)(3) organization, and donations are fully tax deductible. The museum’s EIN is **46-4118590**. For more information about making a contribution, please call 415.345.6843.

### Ron and Diane Disney Miller Memorial Fund

Donations may be made to the memorial fund that The Walt Disney Family Museum has established in honor of Ron and Diane Disney Miller. Donations will support the museum's ongoing education efforts. Please visit Ticket Desk or send donations to The Walt Disney Family Museum, ATTN: Director's Office; 104 Montgomery Street, San Francisco, CA 94129. 

### Submit a Donation Request

The Walt Disney Family Museum is a nonprofit organization, and, therefore, we appreciate the importance of donations to support the work of fellow non-profits and organizations whose activities enrich the greater community in which we all live. We are deeply committed to our community and proud to support it. The museum makes donations of general admission tickets to support organizations and programs focused on arts and culture, education, health, environmental issues, and animal welfare. Donations in support of community goodwill for other causes and regions outside of California are at the discretion of The Walt Disney Family Museum. 

Though our goal is to fulfill as many requests as possible, we are unable to support every organization with a donation. Additionally, The Walt Disney Family Museum is not affiliated with Disney Enterprises, Inc. and cannot provide tickets or access to Disney Enterprises-related properties and events.
