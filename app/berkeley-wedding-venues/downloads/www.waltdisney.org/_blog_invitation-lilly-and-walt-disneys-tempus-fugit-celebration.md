To celebrate the 100th anniversary of the founding of The Walt Disney Company, The Walt Disney Family Museum is showcasing objects from the museum’s collection that highlight important moments in Walt’s life and career. These objects, which include recent acquisitions and fragile materials that have never been publicly displayed, will rotate periodically throughout the year.

Once 160-acres of mostly orange groves beside the Santa Ana freeway, Disneyland opened to a crowd estimated to be nearly twice the size of the approximately 15,000 invited guests. From the park’s earliest days through the end of his life, Walt maintained a deep, personal involvement in Disneyland. Just a few days before the park opened, Walt and Lillian Disney celebrated their 30th wedding anniversary at the Golden Horseshoe saloon in Frontierland. This invitation to the Disney’s’ “Tempus Fugit Celebration” is addressed to Diane and Ron Miller—their eldest daughter and son-in-law—and features a hand drawn map in colored pencil showing their guests how to navigate the newly-built park.
