# Website Account Set-up Guide

We are excited to share some updates to our website, waltdisney.org. We have streamlined and improved our ticket purchasing system, including:

  * A Member Portal, where you can find and update your membership information, access hours of exclusive members-only content, and more
  * Checkout for member tickets, memberships, donations, and merchandise
  * Discounts automatically applied at checkout, without the need for a discount code



To try out the Member Portal, view one of the following step-by-step set-up guides on setting up and accessing your account below.

Contact the Membership Department at [membership@wdfmuseum.org](mailto:membership@wdfmuseum.org) for further assistance.
