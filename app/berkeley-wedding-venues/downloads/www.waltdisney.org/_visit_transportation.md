### By Bicycle 

Bicycle Parking

Presidio Bicycle Rentals

Bicycles are a great way to explore the Presidio—either on one of the Presidio's [bike friendly trails](https://www.presidio.gov/transportation-internal/Shared%20Documents/Presidio%20Bike%20Map.pdf "Download bike map") or using the [Slow Streets network](https://www.presidio.gov/transportation/forms/h/slow-streets "Go to Slow Streets page"). Bay Wheels bike share brings classic bikes and electric bikes to the Presidio, making it easier to explore some of the park’s sometimes steep 25 miles of terrain. Activated through the Lyft mobile app, those over the age of 18 can use the app to find a bike in a safe location and use a bike as an option for getting to and around the park.

There are two bike share stations in the Presidio to pick-up or return classic bikes: at the Presidio Transit Center near Letterman Digital Arts Center and at MacArthur Meadow. While riders must return classic bikes to a station, electric (or e-)bikes may also be parked at Presidio bike racks. Explore the [real-time Bay Wheels map](https://account.baywheels.com/map "Go to Bay Wheels site") for station and bike locations on their website.

Operating an Electric Bicycle in the Presidio

Before operating an electric bicycle in the park, remember the three Rs:

  * Road! E-bikes may only be used on roads in the Presidio and are not allowed on trails.
  * Rack! When not in use, bicycles must be parked at a station or bike rack – see this [bike rack map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?hl=en&ll=37.79900980719871%2c-122.465431&z=14&mid=1Z0cN7IJMzD6W42OKqYmkmUCZqrw "Go to Google site")
  * Respect! Do not leave bikes where they block roads, block access to trails or buildings and take care not to damage park features when locking bikes.
