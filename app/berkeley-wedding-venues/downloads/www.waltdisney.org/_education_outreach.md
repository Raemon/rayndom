# Outreach

Through in-depth and engaging outreach programming, we serve the Bay Area and continue our history of programming _with_ our community—rather than _for_ it.

##  Title I Partnerships 

The museum partners with nine Title I schools in the greater Bay Area, providing transportation and ticket waivers for fieldtrips and classroom visits. In addition to the typical K-12 experience, this programming includes arts enrichment for young adults with developmental disabilities.

##  Access Exhibitions 

Aimed at raising awareness, the museum highlights underserved members of our community through annual special exhibitions. Audiences served include artists with disabilities and seniors afflicted by memory disorders. Participants receive hands-on art instruction and visit the museum for inspiration.

##  Regional Outreach 

As a member of the Region 5 Expanded Learning STEAM Steering Committee, The Walt Disney Family Museum shares its curriculum with after-school educators from Monterey, San Benito, Santa Clara, and Santa Cruz counties. Representatives from the museum facilitate trainings and mentor site leaders.

##  Virtual Tour 

Outside of the Bay Area? Now students can visit The Walt Disney Family Museum without ever leaving school. Benefitting from embedded digital media content, this walk-through the museum brings Walt’s inspirational message to life. Classes learn about his early failures, the art of animation, storytelling principles, and the technological innovations that made classics like  _Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs_(1937) possible.
