# Membership Frequently Asked Questions

We hope to save you time by answering some of the most frequently asked questions about membership below. If you do not find the answers you're looking for, contact the Membership Department at 415.345.6810 or [membership@wdfmuseum.org](mailto:membership@wdfmuseum.org).

### Cards, Member Guests & Admission Guidelines 

Just signed up for a membership and not sure how your card works? Been a member for awhile but can't recall how to use your VIP tickets? The below frequently asked questions (and answers) should help you with all of your questions regarding your membership card, member guest entry, VIP tickets, and more. 

How long will it take for my membership card(s) to arrive?

It may take up to two weeks for your membership card(s) to arrive to your home by mail. If your membership was purchased online and you would like immediate access to the museum, please print out your temporary membership card—which is attached to your confirmation e-mail—and bring it directly to the gallery entrance.

Do I need to pick up tickets each time I visit the museum?

To accommodate our guests safely, we encourage all guests—including members—to reserve tickets prior to their visit. Admission to the main museum is available on a timed-ticket basis with limited capacities set for each time slot. Please visit [waltdisney.org/visit/admission](https://www.waltdisney.org/visit/admission) to book your reservation. For guests not included under your membership, see section below. 

Do I need tickets for special exhibitions?

To accommodate our guests safely, we encourage all guests—including members—to reserve tickets to the special exhibition prior to their visit. Member guests can purchase tickets to the special exhibition online or by visiting our Ticket Desk—accompanying member must be present. Please visit [www.waltdisney.org/visit/admission](https://www.waltdisney.org/visit/admission) to book your reservation.

Do I need to show identification when I use my membership card?

Yes, when you present your membership card, please also be prepared to show a photo ID.

Who can use my membership card?

Membership cards are non-transferable and may only be used by the person whose name is on the card. A valid photo ID is required when using your personalized membership card.

What happens if I lose my membership card?

If a valid membership card is lost, please notify our Membership Coordinator by emailing [membership@wdfmuseum.org](mailto:membership@wdfmuseum.org) for a replacement. If needing day-of admission assistance prior to the delivery of a new valid membership card, please visit Ticket Desk and our Guest Experience staff can accommodate your visit. 

Do my guests also receive free admission on my membership?

Every membership level include at least one guest admission to the main galleries—the number of guests allowed is determined by your membership level. More information on how many guests each membership allows can be found on the [Membership](https://www.waltdisney.org/join/membership) page.

What if I have more guests than my membership provides for?

Additional guest tickets may be purchased at $4 off per ticket for admission to the main galleries. To redeem discount, please visit Ticket Desk on the day of your visit or email [membership@wdfmuseum.org](mailto:membership@wdfmuseum.org) prior to your visit. 

Do children receive free access to the museum?

Children ages 5 years and under always receive complimentary admission to the museum's permanent collection, regular screenings, and special exhibitions.

Do I need to accompany my guests using my VIP tickets?

The member does not need to be present for their VIP tickets to be redeemed. If VIP tickets are lost, they will not be replaced; VIP tickets have no cash value and must be redeemed before the expiration date printed on the ticket.

What membership levels have more than one card holder?

There are two named card holders with Dual, Friend, and Supporter membership levels. Family, Family+, Walt's Circle Donors, and Corporate Members have opportunities to have multiple cards issued.

May I add a card on my membership named “guest”?

Individual memberships must be assigned to individual names that also appear on membership cards. If you have a change in your family's status and wish to make a one-time change to names covered on your account and included in cards, please contact [membership@wdfmuseum.org](mailto:membership@wdfmuseum.org). Cards may not be issued with the name "Guest," but members holding Friend level memberships and above may request multiple cards imprinted with their own name. In such cases, that member must be present for each museum visit.

### Renewals, Upgrades & More

Below are some frequently asked questions, which are often asked by existing members. For a complete list of member benefits and more information on how to renew your membership, please [visit our dedicated Membership page](https://www.waltdisney.org/join/membership), or, if you're interested in a donor membership, please [visit our dedicated Walt's Circle page](https://www.waltdisney.org/join/walts-circle). 

For How Long is a Membership Valid?

Memberships are valid for one year from purchase and are renewable annually. You may also renew in advance for an additional one-year period (maximum of two years).

Can I upgrade my membership to a higher level?

Yes. You may upgrade to any level by paying the pro-rated difference between the remaining dates of your membership at your current level and the cost of the upgraded level you wish to join. If you have 90 days or fewer remaining before your current membership expires, you may also elect to add an advance renewal of your membership at the upgraded level for your convenience.

Are memberships tax deductible?

Yes, but the amount of the contribution that is deductible for federal income tax purposes is limited to the excess of any money (and the value of any property other than money) contributed by the donor over the fair market value of goods or services provided by the museum. A good faith estimate of the fair market value of the goods or services is provided on our membership website for each level of membership and Walt's Circle donor gifts.

Do you offer lifetime memberships?

No, lifetime memberships are **NOT** available at this time.

Will I receive a refund should I choose to cancel my membership?

You may cancel your membership at any time, but membership dues **cannot be refunded**. 

I recently renewed my membership, so why am I still receiving notices to renew?

Due to processing time, some materials may cross paths in the mail. You should not receive further reminders to renew once you have received your updated membership packet. If you continue to receive prompts for renewal, please contact our Membership Department at [membership@wdfmuseum.org](mailto:membership@wdfmuseum.org) or 415.345.6810. 

Can I change information attached to my membership, such as an address or phone number?

### Program Discounts, Ticketing & Early Access 

Members receive early access to purchase tickets for programs and events as well as discounted rates on said tickets. Answers to our most commonly asked questions regarding program ticketing are listed below. 

How much of a member discount do I receive on ticketed programs and/or events?

The discount varies program-to-program. Check our [calendar](https://wdfmuseum.org/calendar) for upcoming schedules and ticket pricing.

How and when will I be notified of film screenings, programs, and special events?

Programs, events, and special film screenings are announced through enews and on the museum website. You may purchase your tickets online, over the phone, or in-person at the Ticket Desk.

Do members receive early or priority access to purchase tickets for programs and events?

Yes, the museum offers advance sales (or reservation for free events) for ticketed programs for all membership levels. In most instances, access to advance ticket sales is tiered by level of donor and membership contribution. Ticket on-sale date and times are provided in email communications as part of our quarterly program update or as individual programs are announced.

Is there a limit on the amount of tickets I can buy for each ticketed program or event?

For most programs, there is a limit of six tickets available for purchase per household, unless otherwise stated, for any ticketed program or event, including non-paid ticketed programs and events. The museum reserves the right to void tickets purchased in excess of this limit. In some instances, the museum will impose lower limits based on capacity of venue and/or special considerations. These additional limitations will be stated in the program description.

If I am not able to attend a program, can I return my program tickets or receive a refund?

The museum does not issue refunds for unused or returned tickets. However, if you have purchased tickets to a program or event and you are not able to attend, you can donate your tickets back to the museum for resale and receive credit for a tax-deductible gift. You may donate your tickets until 10am two days before the program or event and receive a record of your tax-deductible contribution equivalent to the ticket price. To donate your tickets back, please send an email to [tickets@wdfmuseum.org](mailto:tickets@wdfmuseum.org) indicating the confirmation number for the original ticket purchase. You will be sent a donation receipt via email once your unused tickets have been accepted for donation back to the museum.

Please note the museum is not able to accept tickets for donation after 10am two days prior to the program or event. We cannot accept donations of tickets over the phone or in-person. 

If a program is sold out, can I join a waitlist?

Due to the overwhelming popularity of programs events at the museum, tickets often sell out quickly. The museum does not collect waitlists for programs or events.

### Miscellaneous | Private Events, Membership Termination & More

Couldn't find what you were looking for above? A few more common questions are outlined here, but please reach out to our Membership Department with any additional inquiries. 

When organizing a private event or group visit, do I need to book through the museum?
