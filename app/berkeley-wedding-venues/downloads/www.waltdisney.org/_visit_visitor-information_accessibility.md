# Accessibility 

We are committed to making the museum more accessible to all of our visitors by providing resources that will enhance each person's visit.

WDFM Mobile App + Translated Tours

We encourage you to download our new mobile app, WDFM, prior to your visit to the museum. We created this app to make the museum accessible to guests of diverse abilities, economic circumstance, geographic location, and language. Additionally, our app now includes audio for many of the modified listening stations in the museum in order to provide a safe, hands-free way to experience our galleries.

The WDFM app utilizes a number of innovative features and helpful educational tools that allow users of all ages and abilities to explore the museum galleries at their own pace and learn unique facts about Walt Disney. For those visiting the museum, the app provides gallery-by-gallery tours in 12 languages and an Audio-Described Tour for people with vision impairment. Translated languages include American Sign Language, Arabic, Brazilian Portuguese, English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Simplified Chinese, and Spanish.

Discover more and download at [waltdisney.org/mobile-app](http://waltdisney.org/mobile-app).

Due to current restrictions, we no longer have audio devices available for loan. We apologize for any inconvenience.

Accessibility Enhancements for Hearing Impairment

Our WDFM mobile app includes an American Sign Language video tour, as well as other accessibility enhancements. Discover more and download at [waltdisney.org/mobile-app](http://waltdisney.org/mobile-app).

Noise-Cancelling Headphones

Though the museum takes pride in its interactive and audio-centric experiences, we are pleased to offer noise-cancelling headphones FREE of charge on a first-come, first-served basis to guests who have auditory and sensory processing sensitivities, and/or for guests who may feel overstimulated by the volume of some exhibits. 

Wheelchair Accessibility + Rental

We are also committed to creating an accessible environment for all of our guests. Manual wheelchairs are available FREE of charge on a first-come, first-served basis. We also welcome all personal wheelchairs, walkers, scooters, and compact strollers. 

Please visit the Ticket Desk if you would like to borrow a wheelchair or compact stroller. We recommend that guests leave larger strollers in their vehicles and borrow a compact stroller from the museum.

Additionally, our museum welcomes the use of larger mobility strollers and larger mobility wheelchairs. 

Our museum makes large stroller and wheelchair accommodations for mobility and accessibility purposes only. We do not allow other oversized strollers or luggage into our galleries.

Coat check is available only to store large/oversized items that are not permitted in the museum galleries and Museum Store. Please inquire with the Guest Experience team at Ticket Desk or by calling 415.345.6843 or emailing [info@wdfmuseum.org](mailto:info@wdfmuseum.org) prior to your visit.

Service Animals

The Walt Disney Family Museum welcomes service animals. Under federal law, service animals are dogs trained to work or perform tasks for the benefit of people with physical or mental disabilities. The work or tasks performed by a service animal must be directly related to the handler’s disability. Additionally, service animals must remain under their handler’s control at all times while inside the museum. Dogs or any other type of animal or pet whose sole function is to provide comfort, companionship, or emotional support—such as a support animal—do not**** qualify as service animals under federal law and are not**** permitted in the museum. 

Closed Captioning

Closed captioning is available for film screenings when requested in advance. Please call Ticket Desk at 415.345.6800 for details.
