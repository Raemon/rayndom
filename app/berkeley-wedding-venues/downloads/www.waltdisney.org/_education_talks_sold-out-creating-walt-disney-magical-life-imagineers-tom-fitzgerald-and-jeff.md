To this day, Tom continues to write and direct attractions for Disney parks such as “Walt Disney – A Magical Life”, in addition to his portfolio responsibilities.

He worked in attractions at Walt Disney World Resort while in college, then headed to California in 1979 to join the Imagineering team as a writer/producer for the exciting EPCOT Center project.
