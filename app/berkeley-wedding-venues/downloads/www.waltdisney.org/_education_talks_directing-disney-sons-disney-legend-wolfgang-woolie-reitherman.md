### About the Speakers

### Bruce Reitherman

**Bruce Reitherman** is a son of Disney Legend Wolfgang “Woolie” Reitherman—prolific, respected and influential member of Walt’s “Nine Old Men.” Among many other noteworthy credits, Woolie directed _Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree_ (1966) and _The Jungle Book_ (1967). Bruce performed the character voices of Christopher Robin and Mowgli in those two 1960s classics. But Bruce’s experience with rabbit holes and “bare necessities” didn’t stop there. As a young man, his passion for the outdoors drew him deep into the natural world as he enjoyed stints working as a river guide, field biologist, naturalist, and expedition leader. Then, during a period spanning two decades, he produced and/or shot more than 20 primetime television nature documentaries broadcast by BBC, PBS, National Geographic, and others. Over the last 20 years, Bruce has worked closer to home and refocused his interests on the conservation of wildlife habitat, open-space, and agriculture. Now happily retired, he has rededicated himself to a new documentary film project entitled, _Woolie_ , which looks at the remarkable life his father lived both inside and outside of The Walt Disney Studios.

### Robert (Bob) Reitherman

**Robert (Bob) Reitherman** is one of the three sons of Disney animator and director/producer Wolfgang Reitherman, who was one of Walt’s “Nine Old Men.” Bob’s current project is producing a book on his father’s art—not the artwork done for any particular Disney film but the art school work he did that led to him being hired by Disney. That story is similar to that of several other artists hired in the 1930s as Disney was investing in developing the quality of animated movies, leading up to _Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs_ (1937) and others now regarded as classics. Bob’s Disney film experience is quite minor: He did live action modelling for _The Sword in the Stone_ (1963), an animated feature film directed by his father. The bulk of his career has been in the earthquake engineering field. He has written the award-winning history of that discipline, _Earthquakes and Engineers: An International History_(2011), in addition to other books and a number of technical papers.

### Richard W. Reitherman, MD, PhD

Dr. Richard Reitherman received his doctorate in neuroscience from the University of California, San Diego developing protein chemistry techniques for the purification and characterization of cell surface receptor glycoproteins related to cell differentiation and applications to the biology of neuronal recognition systems. These proteins ultimately were identified as a class of ubiquitous oncogene domains, Discoidin 1 and 2. He then accepted a post-doctoral fellowship at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California to study melanoma cell surface receptor molecules that mediate organ-specific metastasis. He earned his medical degree from the University of Southern California School of Medicine, and then completed his internship in internal medicine as well as his residency in diagnostic radiology at L.A. County USC Medical Center. 

In regard to his research interests, Dr. Reitherman is well-known for his clinical role in the early adaptation, promotion and refinement of Breast MRI with more than 20 years’ experience in breast imaging and intervention. He has published many peer reviewed articles, abstracts, written over 30 editorials, and presented at over 40 conferences nationally and internationally. International conference presentations include “Risk Based Imaging Algorithms for Breast Cancer Screening” Rio de Janeiro May 2013 at the Pan American Breast Symposium. In addition, he was a member of the ASBD Breast Screening Guidelines Committee (2005), and the First ASBD Breast MRI Consensus Committee that was held in 2004 that lead to acceptance of Lifetime risk guidelines for Screening Breast MRI first adopted by The American Cancer Society.
