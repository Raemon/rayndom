### About the Speaker

### Don Hahn

Disney Legend **Don Hahn** has produced some of the most successful animated films of all time, including Walt Disney Animation Studios’ _Beauty and the Beast_ (1991)—the first animated film to be nominated for a Best Picture Oscar®—and the global phenomenon _The Lion King_ (1994). 

He studied music and art before starting at Walt Disney Animation Studios in 1976 in the basement of the Inking &  
Painting building where the old animation artwork was stored. He soon worked for Disney Legend Wolfgang “Woolie” Reitherman, one of Walt Disney’s legendary “Nine Old Men” who directed _One Hundred and One Dalmatians_ (1961) and _The Jungle Book_ (1967)—movies that Hahn idolized as a kid. 

Hahn’s credits include _The Hunchback of Notre Dame_ (1996), _The Emperor’s New Groove_ (2000), _Atlantis: The Lost Empire_ (2001), and _Maleficent_(2014). Three of his films— _Who Framed Roger Rabbit_ (1988), _Beauty and the Beast_ , and _The Lion King_ —are now in the Library of Congress collection as culturally, historically, and esthetically important. 

His documentaries _Waking Sleeping Beauty_ (2009), the seminal film about the Disney renaissance of the late-1980s through the 1990s, and _Howard_ (2018), a biography on the life of influential songwriter Howard Ashman, were shown at film festivals and can now be seen on Disney+. He produced _Richard M. Sherman: Songs of a Lifetime_ for PBS in 2015. He was a founder and Executive Producer of the acclaimed Disneynature nature documentary film series.

Hahn serves on the advisory board of The Walt Disney Family Museum and is a former trustee of PBS SoCal. He has been honored with two Academy Award® nominations, an Emmy for his PBS documentary _Freedom Writers: Stories from the Heart_ , two Golden Globes® for Best Picture, and two honorary doctorate degrees. In 2022, he was inducted as a Disney Legend, awarded to those who have made extraordinary and integral contributions to The Walt Disney Company.
