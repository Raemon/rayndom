_Walt Disney Treasures: Personal Art and Artifacts from The Walt Disney Family Museum_ chronicles the legacy of the legendary American artist, storyteller, filmmaker, and visionary through iconic objects that represent his life and career. Through historical research, firsthand accounts, and Walt’s own words, readers will uncover treasured artifacts that tell the true story of Walt Disney and his family, as well as the significance of each item to Walt’s personal and professional life. Compiled by Walt’s grandson Walter E. D. Miller with Executive Director Kirsten Komoroske and museum staff, _Walt Disney Treasures_ commemorates the museum’s 15th anniversary and presents more than 250 stunning images from its vast collection and the Disney family’s personal archives. Some of the artifacts showcased in this book can only be seen inside The Walt Disney Family Museum galleries, while others have never been seen by the public. “Every item featured in this book tells a story—some that are well-known Disney lore, and others that are rarely told—each representing an important brick that helped build a global empire, but also exploring who the person Walt Disney truly was,” says Miller. Just as one would experience when visiting the museum in San Francisco, California, readers can now discover Walt’s story like never before.

Readers of all ages and backgrounds will be inspired and entertained by images and stories of the unique personal ephemera, artifacts, and treasures found in the book, which include Walt’s handwritten designs of EPCOT, the bronzed hat gifted to his wife Lillian, original animation artwork from Disney animated films, concept art for groundbreaking Disneyland attractions, Walt’s miniature steam engine the Lilly Belle, and Walt’s individual record-setting collection of Academy Awards®. 

_Walt Disney Treasures_ is a must-have book for Disney fans, pop culture enthusiasts, and anyone interested in exploring the life of a 20th century icon.
