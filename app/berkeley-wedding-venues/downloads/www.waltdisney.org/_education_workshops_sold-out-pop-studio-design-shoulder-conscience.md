Good or bad, truth or lie, there is always that little voice that seems to direct us toward the right path… more or less! While Pinocchio is the main protagonist of his story, his guide Jiminy Cricket has become an unforgettable character in his own right. Join us as we celebrate the 85th anniversary of Walt Disney’s  _Pinocchio_ (1940) and uncover the history of both the film and the original story. After, you will use shape language techniques to design and construct your own 3D version of a personal conscience character, who will politely remain on your shoulder.
