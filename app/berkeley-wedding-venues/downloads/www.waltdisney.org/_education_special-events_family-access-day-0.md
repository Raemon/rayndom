In observance of National Autism Acceptance Month and in conjunction with Support for Families, The Walt Disney Family Museum invites children with disabilities and special healthcare needs to enjoy the museum’s galleries with their friends and families on April 3, free of charge. For the first hour of the day, our galleries will be reserved exclusively for Support for Families, allowing them to enjoy quiet time before the building opens to the public. Families can explore the galleries, experiment with animation in our Learning Center, and watch a sensory-friendly Disney film screening in our theater.

### Ticketing Information

Free tickets must be reserved via [Support for Families](http://supportforfamilies.org/family-access-day/). Please note: This event will sell out and we are only able to admit guests with pre-reserved tickets.

### Schedule of Events

#### 10am–noon | Animation Activity

##### Learning Center, Lower Level****

Create your own animated short film with your family and friends using clay and cut paper to craft fun characters. 

#### 10–11am (exclusively for Support for Families) | Core Galleries 

##### Gallery entrance on the first floor 

**Please note: Support for Families are also welcome to visit beyond 11am once the museum has opened to the public. Last entry into the galleries is at 4:30pm.**

Explore the museum galleries at your own pace. Make sure to stop by our Spotlight Talk | Disneyland: Imagining the Happiest Place on Earth, happening at 10:30am in Gallery 9, presented by one of our Gallery Associates. Spotlight Talks are brief explorations of topics related to Walt’s life, and this one is centered around our Disneyland model. 

#### 11am–12:30pm & 2–3:30pm | Sensory Friendly Film Screenings 

##### Theater, Lower Level 

As part of our special Family Access Day programming, The Walt Disney Family Museum will present two special sensory-friendly film screenings of The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (1977) at 11am and 2pm in our theater. To make this film a comfortable experience for all, lights will be dimmed instead of off, volume will be slightly lowered, and closed captioning will be turned on. Guests are welcome to get up, walk around, dance, and enjoy the film in whatever way is most comfortable to them.
