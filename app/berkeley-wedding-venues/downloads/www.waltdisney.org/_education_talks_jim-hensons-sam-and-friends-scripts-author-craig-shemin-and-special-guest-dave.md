**Craig Shemin** , author of _Sam and Friends: The Story of Jim Henson’s First Television Show_ —and its upcoming follow-up volume _The Sam and Friends Script Book_ —began his career with a 14-year stint at the Jim Henson Company.

He co-wrote the Webby-nominated web series _The Muppets Kitchen,_ assisted Miss Piggy with her cookbook _In the Kitchen with Miss Piggy_ , and worked on numerous Muppet television appearances and other projects. His more recent Muppet work includes Carnegie Hall’s _Jim Henson’s Musical World_ (2012) and _The Jim Henson Retrospectacle in Concert_ (2018) in New Zealand. 

Now serving as President of the Jim Henson Legacy, a non-profit organization dedicated to celebrating the work of Jim Henson, Shemin is a noted Henson historian.

He also curates the Henson screening events at Museum of the Moving Image, and in 2022 produced Disney’s D23 Expo’s _There’s Magic in the Air_ , a special performance and panel marking the 30th anniversary of _The Muppet Christmas Carol_(1992).

Outside of the world of Jim Henson, Shemin’s television work includes the recent PBS/Amazon series _Clifford the Big Red Dog_ and Nick Jr.’s _Abby Hatcher_. For Disney, he created and wrote _Lou and Lou: Safety Patrol_ and wrote the Emmy®-nominated _Tasty Time with ZeFronk_. He directed a series of streaming holiday specials featuring Spookley the Square Pumpkin. His writing credits also include Nick Jr.’s _Dora and Friends: Into the City_ , _Oobi,_ _Gullah Gullah Island_ , and the Cartoon Network series _Courage the Cowardly Dog._

He writes and directs the _L.O.S. Kids_ live concert series for New York City’s Little Orchestra Society. At the Lincoln Center, his adaptation of _Babes in Toyland_ played for three holiday seasons and his updated version of Humperdinck’s _Hansel and Gretel_ made its debut in 2014. He is also working on a book about Jack Benny’s television guest appearances.

Shemin was honored by the Puppeteers of America with the George Latshaw Award for achievement in writing in 2023.

He is married to the delightful Tony®-nominated performer Stephanie D’Abruzzo.
