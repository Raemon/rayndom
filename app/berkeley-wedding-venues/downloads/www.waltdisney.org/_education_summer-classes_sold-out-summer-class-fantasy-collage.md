Fairies, dwarves, mermaids, and elves have a special place in the realm of fantasy. These iconic figures are not only found in ancient fables and folklore, but also in Walt Disney’s films and in Disneyland’s Fantasyland! Gather some pixie dust and soar with us as we celebrate the 70th anniversary of the park and learn about the iconic land, while making magical collages based on classic fairytales. This class will also involve learning about basics of design such as color, layout, and textures to create fantastic realms and characters of your own.

### Additional Class Details

This class will be teaching students about collage art and how to make their own using a variety of paper ranging from old magazines to scrapbook paper.

**Please note: The last day of class will be a half day (9am–noon). Parents and family are invited to join us at noon to visit the classroom and view student work from the two-week session.**
