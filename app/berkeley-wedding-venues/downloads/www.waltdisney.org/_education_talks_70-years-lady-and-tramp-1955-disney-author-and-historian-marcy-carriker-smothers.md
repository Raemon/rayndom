### Holly Foster Wells

As the granddaughter of legendary singer-songwriter Peggy Lee, **Holly Foster Wells** has dedicated her career to preserving and championing one of the most distinctive voices in American music. Her education in the entertainment industry began early as she toured with her grandmother and gained firsthand insight into the artistry and business behind the spotlight. After earning a degree in Communications from California Lutheran University, Wells launched a successful career in television production, working as a coordinator for The Carsey-Werner Company, Castle Rock Entertainment, and NBC, contributing to some of the most iconic shows of their time, including Roseanne, Seinfeld, and Will & Grace. In 1998, she transitioned from television to legacy work, stepping into the role she had long been preparing for as president of Peggy Lee Associates. Today, Wells oversees every aspect of her grandmother’s legacy—including licensing, catalog management, publishing, marketing and strategic partnerships—while safeguarding her grandmother’s artistic vision and ensuring that Peggy Lee’s voice continues to resonate with new generations.
