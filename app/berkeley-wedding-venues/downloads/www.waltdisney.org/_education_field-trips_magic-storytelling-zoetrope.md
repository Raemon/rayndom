Before flips books, stop-motion films, and computer animated movies, zoetropes were created as a form of animation technology from the early 1800s. A zoetrope is a device that produces the illusion of motion through a sequence of drawings. In this workshop, students will learn about the early forms of animation, illustrate their own drawings, and watch them come to life when seen through the zoetrope!

### Virtual and On-site School Experiences

Our new Virtual and On-site Workshop offerings are activity-based, and available in either a one- or two-hour class. The two-hour session is more comprehensive and allows students more time to work on their projects.

Virtual School Experiences occur online through Zoom. Students are required to have an internet connection, camera, and microphone in order to communicate with the class.

On-site School Experiences combine a gallery tour and one of our hands-on workshops, allowing students to be creative while exploring Walt Disney’s life and work in meaningful ways. School Experiences appeal to a variety of learning styles and align with the Common Core State Standards.
