# _Disney Cats & Dogs_ Partner Organizations and Adoptable Pets

We are partnering with local non-profits throughout the exhibition to highlight the important work they do for animals in the Bay Area and beyond. You can help support local dogs and cats in need by supporting one of our featured animal rescues or by adopting or fostering a pet in need of a loving home. In the _Disney Cats & Dogs_ exhibition, we will feature different local animal shelters and highlight some of their pets currently available for adoption. Come visit us in person or check this page to see our featured shelters and pets for the month.

### Forgotten Felines of Sonoma County

#### 1820 Empire Industrial Court  
Santa Rosa, CA 95403  
707-576-7999

Forgotten Felines of Sonoma County focuses on cats that are not “owned” and have little to no chance of being spayed, neutered, or receiving medical attention. These cats are our county’s most vulnerable; they are the most likely to be neglected or forgotten. Since 1990, we have been the guardians, protectors, and advocates for the unowned cats in our county and we are now the longest running Trap-Neuter-Return (TNR) organization in the nation.

### SF SPCA Pawsibilities Unleashed Partner Pop-Up Exhibition

SF SPCA Adoption Center  
250 Florida St, San Francisco, CA 94103

**Adoption Center Hours:**  
Tue: 1–6pm  
Wed–Sun: 11am–6pm

In celebration of The Walt Disney Family Museum’s  _Disney Cats & Dogs_ special exhibition, SF SPCA is hosting a special pop-up exhibition at their adoption center. The pop-up, which was curated and installed by the museum’s exhibitions team, features artworks from  _Cats & Dogs_.

_Disney Cats & Dogs_ explores the evolution and innovation of Walt Disney Animation Studios’ animal-inspired animation and storytelling through the decades, and the massive undertaking involved in bringing their iconic cats and dogs to life on screen. Walt Disney’s love for animals and proclivity for starring cats and dogs in his films has led to their endearing portrayals and prominence in Disney’s animated and live-action films to this day.

Enjoy a free pair of tickets to the museum and special exhibition when you adopt an animal from the SF SPCA between January 30–March 31, while supplies last.
