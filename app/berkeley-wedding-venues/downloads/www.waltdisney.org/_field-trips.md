### Virtual and On-site School Experiences

Embark on an exceptional virtual Disney field trip that brings the magic of San Francisco's Walt Disney Family Museum directly to your school, no matter where you are! Our innovative virtual experiences offer an engaging way to explore the rich history and creativity of Walt Disney and his incredible legacy. Our virtual field trips provide an immersive journey through interactive exhibits, behind-the-scenes insights, and captivating stories. Engage with knowledgeable educators, participate in hands-on activities, and delve into the enchanting world of Disney from the comfort of your location. 

Our Virtual Disney Field Trips and On-site Workshop offerings are activity-based and available in either a one- or two-hour class. The two-hour session is more comprehensive and allows students more time to work on their projects. 

Virtual Workshops will occur online through Zoom. Students are required to have an internet connection, camera, and microphone in order to communicate with the class. We’ll take care of the rest!
