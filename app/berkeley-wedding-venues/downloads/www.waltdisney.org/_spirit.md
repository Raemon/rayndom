# _Spirit of the Season: A Community Art Exhibition_

Date

Nov 17, 2022–Mar 19, 2023 

Location

Theater Gallery 

The Walt Disney Family Museum is pleased to present its second annual juried community art show, _Spirit of the Season: A Community Art Exhibition,_ open from today, Thursday, November 17, 2022 through Sunday, March 19, 2023. A diverse selection of paintings, drawings, photographs, 3D objects, digital illustrations, and short films submitted by artists from the local Bay Area community, as well as Mexico, Canada, Germany, and the United Arab Emirates will be on view in the museum’s Theater Gallery.

For Walt Disney, the holidays were a time to honor beloved traditions and create magical memories with his family, such as leaving sunny Los Angeles for snowier peaks, perfect for skiing and sledding. While Walt celebrated Christmas, other notable end-of-year holidays and traditions observed around the world include Kwanzaa, Hanukkah, Ōmisoka, Diwali, Las Posadas, Three Kings Day, Toji, seasonal solstices, and New Year’s. Many of these end-of-the-year celebrations find symbolic meaning in the great flora that surrounds us, with families and friends often marking this special time of year by exploring the outdoors.

For this year’s community art show, we asked artists to take inspiration from the museum’s current special exhibition, _Walt Disney’s The Jungle Book: Making a Masterpiece_ , and create works that highlight the lush, abundant plant life in our environments.

“We’re delighted to mark the upcoming holiday season by showcasing the artistic talents of adult and teen artists from both the Bay Area and around the world,” says The Walt Disney Family Museum Executive Director, Kirsten Komoroske. “ _Spirit of the Season_ celebrates our wonderful community of artists, and each of these artists have my utmost gratitude for generously contributing to this unique exhibition.”

This year’s installment of _Spirit of the Season_ is the fifth in a series of community exhibitions sponsored by The Walt Disney Family Museum; the second to be displayed in person at the museum. Previous exhibitions, including _The World of Tomorrow, it’s a small world,_ and _Conserving the Magic of Our Planet_ were available to view in a virtual, 3D-rendered gallery space hosted on the museum’s website—a free initiative that was developed following the museum’s pandemic-related closure in March 2020.

_Spirit of the Season: A Community Art Exhibition_ is presented in conjunction with _Kaleidoscope_ _,_ a retrospective of abstract work by artist Chris Miller, on display in the museum’s adjacent Lower Lobby Gallery. A selection of _Spirit of the Season_ artwork contributed by museum staff will also be available to view. Both exhibitions open on Thursday, November 17 and will be free to the public.
