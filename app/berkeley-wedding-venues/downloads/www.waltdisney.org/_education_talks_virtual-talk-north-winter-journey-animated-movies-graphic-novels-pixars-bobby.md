### Bobby Podesta

**Bobby Podesta** has been drawing cartoons for as long as he can remember and published his first newspaper comic strip while still in high school. After studying character animation at CalArts, he joined Pixar Animation Studios, where he has contributed as an Animator, Story Artist, Supervising Animator, and Director on many of their beloved films and series. _North for the Winter_ is Podesta’s graphic novel debut and will be published by First Second Books in Fall 2025. He lives in Oakland, California, with his wife, daughter, son, some chickens, a spoiled cat, and a very cute dog. He still draws cartoons every day.
