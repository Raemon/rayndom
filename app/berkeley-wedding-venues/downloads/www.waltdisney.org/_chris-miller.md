# _Chris Miller: Kaleidoscope_

Date

Nov 17, 2022–Mar 19, 2023 

Location

Lower Lobby 

The Walt Disney Family Museum is honored to host _Chris Miller: Kaleidoscope_ , a new exhibition of recent works by painter Chris Miller. The exhibition will be on display in the museum’s Theater Gallery and free to view from Thursday, November 17, 2022 through Sunday, March 19, 2023. 

This vibrant collection consists of abstract paintings of both large- and small-scale that Chris created over this past year, complemented by a singular, special piece from his archives. Each artwork explores captured or remembered experiences in nature—the beauty of unique trees, rocks, flowers, and views, which have long served as sources of Chris’ inspiration—and the powerful influences of past and present artists. 

A native Californian, Chris was born in Carmel and grew up in Southern California. During his childhood years, the San Fernando Valley was in its late transition from an agriculture hub to a suburb, and pockets of abandoned orchards were interspersed with emergent residential subdivisions. Those orchards and the nearby Santa Monica Mountains afforded access to the natural world, and, as with many children, Chris was frequently absorbed in expressing experiences in crayon and colored pencil drawings, giving physical form to his imagination. He also found inspiration and encouragement from his grandfather, Walt Disney. 

Artwork showcased in _Chris Miller: Kaleidoscope_ will be available for purchase through the museum’s website or in the Museum Store, with all proceeds benefitting the museum’s educational efforts, including The Walt Disney Family Museum Animation Academy. Sold artworks will remain on view at the museum until March 2023, then will be available for pickup or shipping.

### About the Artist

Born in Carmel, California, **Chris Miller** grew up in southern California’s San Fernando Valley as it transitioned from agriculture to suburb, where pockets of abandoned orchards interspersed with emergent residential subdivisions made it possible for a child to experience the natural world easily. He continues to find his inspiration in that world. 

Chris is the son of the late Ron and Diane Miller and grandson of Walt and Lillian Disney. After raising their two daughters in Telluride, Colorado, Chris and his wife Catherine McNamee moved to Napa Valley’s Soda Canyon, California, where they have lived since 2012. Chris serves as a board member for The Walt Disney Family Museum and Walt Disney Family Foundation.
