Walt Disney was a man of many passions—art, storytelling, family, and entrepreneurship. Most people have yet to learn about his love affair with the titan of transportation: the steam train.

_Walt Disney’s Trains: A Grand Circle Tour Through His Life and Legacy_ reveals an intriguing part of his life. Explore how railroading influenced Walt’s films, theme parks, and personal life, as well as how he influenced the perception and preservation of railroading in America. From his miniature Lilly Belle locomotive to the iconic Monorail at Walt Disney World Resort and beyond, Walt’s love of trains is told through more than 200 artifacts from The Walt Disney Family Museum archives, The Walt Disney Company, and private lenders. These include rare sketches, models, firsthand accounts of Walt’s passion for the craft, and more.

In 2014, The Walt Disney Family Museum in San Francisco, California crafted an immersive exhibition called _All Aboard: A Celebration of Walt’s Trains_ that journeyed through his affinity for trains using film, animation, audio, and art—more than 200 rare artifacts. Visitors so greatly enjoyed this show that it was extended beyond its initial run and stands as one of the best attended exhibitions in the museum’s 15-year history.

This enchanting book builds upon the stories told in the exhibition. Firsthand accounts, family photos, and treasured heirlooms enrich this tour through Walt’s own story. Film and attraction concept art—some publicly unveiled for the first time—reveal how Walt Disney’s railroad legacy continues today.

Exhibition Curator Michael Campbell’s fascinating text charts the trajectory of Walt’s interest in trains, from long before it manifested itself in his work, to the ways his railroading legacy is honored and carried forward in Disney parks and movies today.

FEATURING HUNDREDS OF ARTIFACTS, images of Walt with his trains, model trains from Walt’s personal collection, and more. Many of these items have never been seen before in-print.
