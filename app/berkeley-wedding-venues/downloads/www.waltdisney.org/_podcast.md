At WD-FM, we're not just any Disney podcast – we're your official connection to the magic! The Walt Disney Family Museum is privileged to house a treasure trove of Walt Disney's most cherished stories and artifacts, giving you an exclusive peek into the heart and soul of the company. 

Our monthly Museum Musings keep you in the loop about all the exciting happenings at The Walt Disney Family Museum, with interviews from our passionate museum team who are dedicated to carrying on Walt Disney's legacy. Each month we host our Collections Clash, where our hosts each pick three objects on view in our galleries and you the audience get to vote on your favorites.

Our Deep Dive episodes are like stepping back in time, with exclusive audio clips from the man himself, Walt Disney, and those who worked alongside him. Plus, we're all about making Disney accessible to everyone, which is why we've turned every episode into a video podcast with closed captions available on YouTube and Facebook. Join us on this incredible journey through Disney's history, and become a true Disney expert!
