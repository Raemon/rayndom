While serving as President of Walt Disney Productions and Chief Executive Officer of The Walt Disney Company, former President of The Walt Disney Family Museum Ron Miller executive-produced several films including the 1985 animated feature, _The Black Cauldron_ , based on the classic fantasy book by Lloyd Alexander. The film was also the start of a celebrated Disney career for animator and friend of the museum Disney Legend Andreas Deja, known for bringing to life some of Disney’s most recognizable characters of the past 40 years, including Gaston from _Beauty and the Beast_ (1990), Scar from _The Lion King_ (1994), and the title character from _Hercules_ (1997).

Join us in celebrating Miller and Deja’s legacies by attending a special screening of this rich, dark fantasy-adventure where a small band of unlikely heroes save the world from the evil Horned King. (Runtime: 80 minutes) 

Film screenings are subject to change. If you’re unable to attend a film screening within the first 20 minutes of the film duration, please contact our Ticketing team at [tickets@wdfmuseum.org](mailto:tickets@wdfmuseum.org) for a refund.

Children under 12 years of age must be accompanied by an adult who shall be responsible for the child at all times.
