#### I am going to The Walt Disney Family Museum. When I see the red brick building with the big red signs, I will know I am there! My group and I will explore the museum, learn new things, and have fun. Before we enter the museum, a museum staff member wearing a red sweater will help us find our pre-purchased tickets. Our tickets can be on our phones or printed out.

#### Now that I am in the museum, I will try my best to use my inside voice.

#### If I have a question about where to go, I can visit the front desk.

#### The museum staff wear red sweaters. Museum staff are adults who can teach me new things. They can also help me if I get lost. My group and I will have our tickets ready to be scanned at the gallery entrance.

#### My group and I will decide together what we want to see and do at the museum. We might not have time to see everything. I will try to cooperate with my group so that we can all have fun. If I have questions, I can ask a staff member in the museum.

#### When visiting the museum, I can take the stairs or the elevator. If I take the elevator, I will have to wait my turn and will only enter the elevator with my group.

#### When we are in the museum, I will keep my hands to myself. I will look and not touch with my hands. I can listen to the museum’s audio guide on my phone with headphones or ear buds if I would like.

#### In the galleries, I can look at artwork and videos from Walt Disney movies and his home life. Sometimes there are loud sounds or flashing lights. I will try to stay calm. If I need noise-canceling headphones, I can ask museum staff at the front desk for a pair.

#### If the museum is too loud and exciting, we can go to the porch to sit and take a break. On the porch, I can look at the water, the plants, and the birds. I will take deep breaths until I am ready to explore more.

#### My group and I may visit the Museum Store. There are lots of toys and gifts in the store, and I will look at them and be careful when touching them.

#### At the end of my visit, I will wave goodbye to the red brick building. I had a wonderful time at The Walt Disney Family Museum.
