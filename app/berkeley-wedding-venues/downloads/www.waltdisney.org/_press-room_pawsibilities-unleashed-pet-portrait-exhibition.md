**San Francisco, October 26, 2023** —The Walt Disney Family Museum is pleased to announce _Pawsibilities Unleashed: A Pet Portrait Exhibition_. Presented concurrently with our special exhibition, _Disney Cats & Dogs_, this unique collection of artworks will feature portraits by local Bay Area and Disney-related artists, showcasing the profound impact animal companions have on their creative expression. _Pawsibilities Unleashed_ will also showcase animal-related collectibles from Walt’s personal collection in addition to rare, non-English language posters from an array of classic, animal-centric Disney films. 

This original exhibition is co-curated by Tracie Timmer, Public Programs Manager, and Marina Villar Delgado, Director of Collection and Exhibitions, and will be on view in the museum’s Theater Gallery and Lower Lobby beginning Thursday, November 16, 2023, through March 2024, and will be free to the public. 

Pets bring entertainment, comfort, and companionship for so many of us, and for artists, they can also be a source of great inspiration. “With the success of _Disney Cats and Dogs_ , we hoped to find more ways to bring the joy of pets to our museum guests,” says Timmer. “We also sought to highlight the talented Disney Legends and artists who have contributed to many beloved animal characters in Disney films over the years, including Pete Docter, Andreas Deja, John Musker, and many more, alongside local artists who have immortalized pets of all shapes and sizes with their distinctive creativity and vision. As you will discover in this exhibition, one common theme rings true in each of these unique artworks—they encapsulate the special bond that humans and animals share.” 

Walt Disney loved, respected, and appreciated animals from a very young age and found many ways to incorporate them into his films, television shows, and other projects throughout his lifetime. Even in the early days of the Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio—known today as The Walt Disney Company—Walt would create roles for his Uncle Robert Disney’s German Shepherd, Peggy. Her live-action debut in the Alice Comedies in 1924 marked the first on-screen appearance of a Disney pet, and she quickly became an audience favorite. 

Walt once said, “Sometimes we recognize ourselves in animals. And that’s what makes them so interesting.” This sentiment rings true for the talented artists and their animal-inspired artworks featured in _Pawsibilities Unleashed_. Featured in the exhibition are works created by some of Walt Disney’s grandchildren and great-grandchildren: Chris Miller, Walter Miller, and Lily Miller. 

As a companion to this exhibition, _Disney Cats & Dogs_—now on view in the Diane Disney Miller Exhibition Hall— explores the evolution and innovation of Walt Disney Animation Studios’ animal-inspired animation and storytelling through the decades, and the massive undertaking involved in bringing their iconic cats and dogs to life on screen. From loveable main characters like Mickey Mouse’s best pal Pluto, Pongo and Perdita from _One Hundred and One Dalmatians_(1961), and Duchess from _The Aristocats_(1970), to supporting sidekicks such as Lucifer from _Cinderella_(1950) and Percy from _Pocahontas_(1995), Walt’s love for animals and proclivity for starring cats and dogs in his films has led to their endearing portrayals and prominence in Disney’s animated and live-action films to this day. In addition to an extensive collection of over 300 archival reproduction concept sketches, paintings, model sheets, animation drawings, posters, photographs, digital artworks, and final film sequences, _Disney Cats & Dogs _also gives visitors an insight into Walt’s love of animals with archival photographs, quotes, and personal stories on display. 

_Pawsibilities Unleashed_ and _Disney Cats & Dogs _are presented in conjunction with this year’s celebration of The Walt Disney Company’s 100th anniversary. 

_Pawsibilities Unleashed: A Pet Portrait Exhibition_ will be on view in the museum’s Theater Gallery and Lower Lobby beginning Thursday, November 16, 2023 through March 2024, and is open free to the public.
