“Last Sunday we honored Wally Boag, the unforgettable comic genius of _The Golden Horseshoe Revue_ ,” Diane Disney Miller reports. “Jeff Kurtti put the program together and presented it, and we were honored by the presence of Wally's son, Laurence, and his family. It was, of course, a very entertaining program. But there were some tears mixed with the laughter. Wally passed away about six weeks ago. His newest grandson was born the morning after his death, and was present in his mother's arms Sunday.”

### Recognizing Betty and Wally

The welcome mat was out Sunday as The Walt Disney Family Museum paid tribute to Betty Taylor and Wally Boag, two stars of Disneyland’s _Golden Horseshoe Revue_. Guests enjoyed a screening of the 1962 episode of _The Wonderful World of Color_ episode _The Golden Horseshoe Revue_ ; followed by a heartfelt panel discussion with Ron and Diane Miller and Wally Boag’s son, Laurence Boag, as they fondly remembered the laughter and music of two of Walt’s favorite performers. 

### Walt’s Love for The Golden Horseshoe Revue

In 1962, Walt featured the 10,000th performance of _The Golden Horseshoe Revue_ as the season opener on his _Wonderful World of Color_ television program. Directed by Ron Miller, the special “augmented” _Golden Horseshoe Revue_ 1962 show included performances by special guests Annette Funicello, Gene Sheldon, and Ed Wynn. Ron Miller recalled that “the idea for this episode was Walt’s. He really loved the show and had fun getting dressed up as a cowboy to film the lead-in.” Ron shared the interesting fact that the episode was filmed both at Disneyland and at The Walt Disney Studios. “We built an exact replica of the stage at the Studio to film the performances and bar fight.” He also remembered that Annette’s performance in the special was a last minute addition. “We originally had Henry Calvin, who played Sergeant Garcia in the [_Zorro_ TV series](https://www.waltdisney.org/blog/out-night-60-years-walt-disneys-zorro) in the show, but he suffered a heart attack and was unable to perform, so we quickly changed the script and added Annette.” 

Diane Disney Miller recalled that “Dad loved that show. He took all of his guests there, kings and presidents, and never tired of it. It never got stale because Wally was always fresh. As a boy in Kansas City, dad had haunted the vaudeville houses with his pal, Walt Pfeiffer. They sought any opportunity to get on stage and perform their skits. Wally was pure vaudeville, and that’s why Dad loved him and the show. Diane shared a story she was told in Italy about Walt and the Horseshoe. “My dad had taken Fellini and his wife to watch _The Golden Horseshoe Revue_ from his private box. When Wally came in shooting his guns he told them, ‘Quick! Get under the table!’ and they all did! I wonder how many times he used that gag on his VIP guests.”

### Growing up in Disneyland

Wally’s son Laurence Boag remembered how fun it was growing up at Disneyland. “Walt had given my Dad and Betty these dressing rooms, like apartments, over the Aunt Jemima Pancake House. We used to spend the night in the park and wake up to the Mark Twain riverboat.” Laurence worked in the Fantasyland Magic Shop with a young Steve Martin, and recalled how his dad would visit the shop and get a kick out of the boys messing up the magic tricks for a comic effect. “It really upset our manager, but always got a laugh of approval from Dad.”

### Laurence’s Surprise Gift

As Jeff Kurtti thanked the panel for their memories, Laurence Boag spoke up, “I have one more surprise for you.” Laurence retreated backstage and emerged carrying Wally Boag’s original Traveling Salesman carpetbag, complete with gunpowder, magic flowers, and a bag of his lima bean “teeth,” In addition, he carried Wally’s beloved bagpipes. “I want to present this to the Millers and to The Walt Disney Family Museum.” The audience rose to its feet with applause, and a few tears were shed as Diane thanked Laurence for his generous gift “What treasure!” Diane said, “and the audience sensed it. They will find their place of honor in the Museum.”

“The tribute to Dad at The Walt Disney Family Museum was the most sincere and heartfelt experience his family could imagine,” Laurence said. “Being able to present his carpetbag and bagpipes to the Museum was not only a real treat, but quite satisfying, as we know they have found a home where they will be honored and viewed by so many of his fans. This is a very special place, and we are touched to share Dad—and his wonderful years with the Disney organization—with the world.” 

### Wally’s Legacy

Diane says, “Wally wrote a biography which we are proud to offer in our Museum Store. It is full of photos and wit—the opening statement makes me laugh every time I read it. But Wally’s life had its great tragedy, too. Comedy, laughter—both are so important in our lives, and we place great value on those who are gifted with the ability to make us laugh. But it is hard work, especially when combined with the athleticism and graceful movement that characterized Wally' s work. The last words of a famous actor Edmund Gwenn were "Dying is easy. Comedy is hard." We'll always be grateful to [Wally Boag](https://www.waltdisney.org/blog/steve-martin-remembers-wally-boag) for the moments of great mirth he gave us to cherish.”

_Although most of his fans associate his comic career with The Golden Horseshoe at Disneyland, his story really begins much earlier than this wonderful relationship with the Disney organization. This delightful book recounts the saga of a farm boy from Portland Oregon “making it big” in the world of vaudeville as a “hoofer” and a comic rolled into one. His early days were those of the quintessential artist struggling to find his niche, he would eventually entertain kings and presidents, American troops at home and abroad, thousands of vaudeville and nightclub patrons on three continents—and millions of Disneyland guests. This is a must-read not just for all of those interested in the Disney Legend, but in the path taken by a trailblazer in the world of Vaudeville, and one man’s voyage through the labyrinth of the entertainment world of the twentieth century._
