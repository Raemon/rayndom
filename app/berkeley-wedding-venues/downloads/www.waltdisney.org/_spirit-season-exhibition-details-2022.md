* * *

Diwali is the most important festival of India. It is the celebration of good over evil in the story of Ramayan. After a happy ending to the story, Sita wishes to return to Earth from where she had emerged. She prays, "Oh Mother Earth! If I am pure, embrace me into your arms." I have used a combination of green, blue, and orange to represent the elements of Earth that come together to accept Sita who was pure as gold.

## _Foggy Boxes on the Hillsides_

Watercolor and ink on paper

* * *

Most people think of the holidays and think of snow, but being from San Francisco, I think of fog creeping in.

Multimedia artist Kai Webb creates with the intent of exploring and communicating  
elusive and abstract feelings.

Being of Black and Indigenous descent, they also explore subjects such as ancestry and spirituality in their paintings and comics.

They hope their works help incite meaningful​ interpersonal conversations, ​and thus meaningful action.

## _A Silent Night in the Jungle_

Pen, markers, colored pencils, oil paint, and acrylic paint

A Silent Night in the Jungle represents Three Kings Day. The endangered Indian Elephant, which is increasingly under stress from various threats and factors, is born in the jungle.

* * *

Buddha is synonymous with spiritual calmness. In this composition, I show Buddha becoming one with nature. The aura of his being is serene yet so powerful that the elements of nature are dancing around him. All beings happily coexist—such is the world I dream of.

## _Rainforest Fir_

Digital illustration

<https://eloracuenco.com>

* * *

Rainforest Fir takes inspiration from the abundant varieties of foliage one can find in the jungle and the classic Christmas tree, combining the two and arranging them into a vibrant jungle Christmas tree. Pines and evergreens are the conventional choice for these famous trees, but thanks to the various sizes and colors of the leaves and flowers that grow in the jungle, this tree doesn't need the help of additional ornaments and tinsel—its beauty stands on its own!

## _The Tigonlily_

Felt, paper, and old tennis balls

* * *

Beginning in 2004, I began recycling my old used tennis balls and make them into Christmas ornaments for friends and family. Each year, I make 55 ornaments of the same design with varying color combinations. These are from the last five years.

#### Tiernan Renee McClanahan (Louisville, Kentucky, United States)

## _Owenton, Kentucky_

Ink on paper

<https://www.instagram.com/travelingtiernan>

* * *

For my family, the holidays were about spending time in nature with the ones we loved. In Kentucky, Louisville is the big, hip, and cool city. Every year around the holidays, we took time and escaped the fast-paced city life to explore our grandparents' home in Owenton, Kentucky. No internet or cell service—just hikes, swimming in the creek, good homestyle fried food, and maybe a trusty beagle by our side. This piece represents the peace, but also the deep, detailed beauty that nature provides.

#### Chloe Lejnieks (San Francisco, California, United States)

## _PEACE_

Acrylic on canvas

<https://www.instagram.com/cocoapaints>

* * *

My expressionistic painting PEACE is about peace and joy for all, which is what the holidays are all about. In my family, we celebrate many different traditions, but always peace on this colorful Earth.

#### Maya Antoinette Colbert (Oakland, California, United States)

## _Mistletoe: Peace, Love, and Berries_

Glass beads, wood, acrylic paint, tacky glue, and beeswax 

* * *

Mistletoe was valued by ancient people around the world for its medicinal properties and used to treat a variety of ailments including high blood pressure and infertility.  
Perhaps these uses led the ancient Romans to associate the plant with peace and love and hang it above their doorways for household protection.  
It's easy to see how this may have led to the current practice of hanging the plant at Christmas time in the hopes of sharing a kiss with someone you admire.

#### Kerry Patten (Vancouver, Canada)

## _Pinecones and Pebbles!_

Watercolor, pen, and acrylic on paper

<https://www.instagram.com/zedbearanim>

* * *

Growing up in a big city, we didn't have too much access to Nature, so we made the best of what we had! Throughout the year, my dad and I would collect pine cones from the local parks and pebbles from the beach. Then at Christmastime we would make our own decorations—painting the pines cones was so much fun, and painting the pebbles too. I painted a picture of this rather than recreating the actual decorations.

#### Mary H. Feenan (Woodland Park, New Jersey, United States)

## _Christmas Cards Through the Years_

Graphite and colored pencil

* * *

Nana (95 years old) has drawn a Christmas card each December for more than 15 years. To celebrate this annual tradition, we created wrapping paper that is a collage of her drawings. Nana’s cards bring joy to all who receive them at Christmastime. She is the very essence of the Christmas spirit.

* * *

We celebrate multiple traditions—from gifty and spiritual holidays, to recognizing the solstice and how nature's cycles affect us—not just in fall and winter, but throughout the year. The Rosh Hashanah tradition of apples and honey reminds me how often we communicate via the language of nature's gifts. The past few years, some parts of our traditions and celebrations have been interrupted, even overshadowed, by the pandemic, but my painting Apples and Honey honors our perseverence.

## _Deck the Boughs with Ray Apparel_

Photograph

* * *

I've always suspected that the Euro-American tradition of decorating our homes in the winter with greenery, rich colors, and a bit of sparkle is an instinctive effort to recapture the natural splendor of a warmer, lush time of year. Maybe we're striving for something like this sunlit autumn evening in the Presidio National Park, when the setting sun gilded the trees, the water glittered, and all felt content.

This picture represents beautiful palm trees lit with tiny gold lights for winter holidays in Florida. I used colored pencils and gel markers to add touches of gold. There are two Christmas trees with the water and sand in the background.

* * *

This book sculpture captures the joy of Christmas night when Santa and his reindeer begin their magical journey to deliver toys to all good children. Red and white paper strips were quilled to create Santa Claus. The reindeer were cut from “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer” sheet music. Each deer’s name can be seen on their face. The sleigh was crafted from "Up on the Housetop" sheet music. A book was used to construct the roof with a paper chimney placed on top, along with lights and snow.

#### Chloe Medina (Burlingame, California, United States)

## _Swirling_

Marker and paint on mixed media paper

* * *

The holidays remind me of family and magic. Something about the season always felt more than reality to me, which inspired the more whimsical aspects of the piece—the glowing stars and color pallette. I live in an area with lush fields but no snow, so I wanted to portray that in this piece. I hope to show the magic of exchanging gifts with those you love along with the young anticipation of receiving them.

## _Poçhutukawa: Christmas in New Zealand_

Photograph

* * *

Yuletide in New Zealand is the heart of summer, but those who associate the holiday with rich reds and greens are pleased to encounter the charismatic native tree that has become embraced as the Kiwi "Christmas tree", the poçhutukawa, whose pouffy crimson blossoms lend a natural festive flair to the season.

* * *

I was inspired by the large Banyan trees and animals from The Jungle Book (1967). I particularly liked the reactions of the Python Kaa. The animals rested and moved under the beautifully detailed Banyan Tree.

* * *

Each cloth piece was sewn by hand. Wool, felt, linen, and crushed velvet, were selected as the fabrics. Santa’s face was painted. Wool was felted onto his head (hair) and chin (beard). His coat was sewn with crushed velvet with wool sleeves and collar. Each deer had cord sewn through it to create their reins, along with chain on each side. A blanket was placed on their back with 15 beads individually attached by hand and a bell hanging from their collar. Branches were used for legs and antlers.

* * *

Rereading The Jungle Book (1894) and rewatching the animated movie inspired me to create a recycled tree with a variety of jungle animals. This sculpture reminded me of a kaleidoscope with bright colored animals. A kaleidoscope is a fun holiday children’s toy that moves when you turn it.

* * *

When I think of the holidays, I think of tropical colors in warm places with touches of red. I used a paper straw cut into strips to make tiny green flowers with red buds mixed in between green leaves. I dipped the straw into acrylic paint, swirled the straw around the paint, and stamped it on the paper. I placed cutouts of leaves from a paper napkin to make the tree come alive.

This holiday tree was created using a paper straw cut into strips. I swirled the straw in acrylic paint and stamped little images of flowers in red and green. The holidays are bright and colorful for all. I used watercolors to build my background. The bright colors in The Jungle Book inspired me to create this holiday tree.

Digital

<https://www.instagram.com/monnerisms>

* * *

In my little town in India, holidays mostly coincided with festivals. Festivals often revolved around celebrating and worshipping nature in its many forms, with folklores and mythology often personifying nature. Taking inspiration from my childhood memories and my culture and heritage, this artwork depicts a spring night as a beautiful woman. Fragrant night flowers, a gentle breeze and the crescent moon, as if night is getting dressed to become a piece of beautiful music, The Night Raga.

For this piece, I wanted to capture the feeling of a story, as I have fond memories of being told whimsical tales around the holidays. I particularly enjoyed drawing the scenery and wanted it to become more vibrant closer to the light.

With this piece, Symphony of the Jungle, I wanted to further explore the environment within the original world of Walt Disney’s The Jungle Book (1967). The main idea behind this concept was to achieve a sense of illumination and to convey a sense of connection, even within the darkest corners of the jungle.

In celebration of the dreams and imagination of Walt Disney, this multiple exposure photo represents the beginnings of those dreams. Pictured is the "Son of Dreaming Tree" and the recreated barn on the original family farm in Marceline, Missouri. As Walt once said, "To tell the truth, more things of importance happened to me in Marceline than have happened since—or are likely to in the future. " This was a photo taken using Elias Disney's original 1909 (patent date) Kodak 2A model B.

The holiday season always meant limitless freedom for me—freedom akin to that of a bird flying in the free blue sky. My artwork represnts the spirit of joy that comes when you finally step away from the study desk and lose yourself in the infinite embrace of nature. My artwork The Dream Hills captures one of my joyful memories of a sunrise during one of our family campings by the hills.

Celebrating the holidays in "Sunny California" really relies on traditions of decorating to make your season feel like the winter holidays. It becomes very important to blend the iconography of the winter season with the natural landscape, to turn the lush vegetation and golden hills of California into a winter wonderland—like placing a snowman with lights and ornaments in a pepper tree.

I have always loved winter. Getting cozy in an oversized sweater with a hot tea in one hand and a good book in the other, two cats on my lap, and a blanket to top it all. This piece is my homage to my love for winter and all the beauty that it brings—with some extra magic to celebrate the holidays. I hope you enjoy my piece as much as I enjoyed making it.

I wanted to share something bright for the season. Using leaves and flowers found in The Jungle Book (1967) and then adding some shiny leaves, I feel this brings the holidays into the jungle. The phrase, right out of the movie, wishes us all to relax and enjoy the season.

This wonderful time of the year is full of beautiful holidays. For this year’s Spirit of the Season exhibition, I created this artwork with a colorful winter town full of holidays with abundant and symbolic flowers from around the world. This artwork represents the people coming together to light up the environment with flora, nature, and their traditions to create a magical and memorable time.

In my little town in India, holidays mostly coincided with festivals. Festivals often revolve around celebrating and worshiping nature in its many forms, with folklores and mythology often personifying nature. Taking inspiration from my childhood memories and my culture and heritage, this artwork depicts a spring night as a beautiful woman. Fragrant night flowers, a gentle breeze and the crescent moon, as if night is getting dressed to become a piece of beautiful music, The Night Raga.

Christmas trees are one of my favourite traditions of the Christmas holidays. No matter how elaborate or humble, they bring me so much joy. A beautiful, majestic gift of nature adorned with twinkling lights and ornaments—each with their own story to tell—and that piney aroma that unlocks memories of Christmases past.

The mirror reflection of the clouds and trees on that calm lake brings peace to any soul contemplating it. Long, unforgettable walks with my dog Simba (who is now seriously missed since his passing).  
Relaxed times, spent meditating and enjoying all the daily free gifts from nature.

The Waltz of the Flowers is a digital illustration that celebrates the holiday tradition of the Nutcracker. This work was inspired in part by the book, The Queens of Animation (2019) and the early female animators that took an interest in Tchaikovsky’s famous "Nutcracker" score.

One of the most amazing things about holidays is the variety of plant matter used in all of them. For this year’s Spirit of the Season exhibition, I created this artwork with people from around the world celebrating their different traditions and the incredible plants, trees, and flowers that form our beautiful environment and lend themselves to holiday symbolism.  
I would like to dedicate this illustration to my beautiful family, especially my mom, my dad, my brother, and my grandma.

Have you ever wondered how Santa celebrates Christmas? In this piece, after a joyful sleigh ride around the world, Santa and his elves exchange presents in front of a crackling fire. If you lean in, you can almost hear the warble of the gramophone and smell the cookies baking.

One of my favorite holiday traditions is ice skating outdoors in the brisk, cool winter air surrounded by snow and trees and sparkling lights. It always feels joyous, energizing, and romantic. No matter how cold our toes get or how red our cheeks become, there is always a smile on our faces, happiness in our hearts, and excitement in knowing hot cocoa and marshmallows await!

A Polish Christmas Eve: Mom and Grandma cook and bake all day while Dad and I deliver gifts and cookies then decorate the tree. I finally get to put the angel on top!  
Later, the whole family gathers to break bread, exchange wishes for the coming year, and feast. Afterwards, Grandpa leads us in singing carols until Santa appears (I wondered why Dad always missed this part). Presents are all around. 

This year's tree is decorated to honor the Ukrainian people.

To me, the spirit of the season is Christmas, when my family and friends make time to get together to celebrate. It's the music and art events, like when I open my art studio at Art-Bias for the public. It's the festivities like the Dickens Fair where its great fun to paint the characters. It's also the Santa Claus ads by Haddon Sundblom that have inspired me to be the artist that I am today.

In my family, Autumn is harvest season. We have traditions of picking apples from our apple trees, going camping in the forest, hiking in the mountains, and hunting game like bear and deer. We honor the natural world and all it provides, feeding us in the fall and then storing it for the long winter ahead.

The holidays are a time to gather people—especially friends and families—together. This art piece I painted is meant to represent how public spaces, such as shopping malls, are turned into winter wonderlands. During times when my quiet neighborhood is not enough to get into the joy, I seek out public celebrations to avoid feeling alone on the inside. The design of this fictional mall is meant to represent my creative outlook on life and hope for happiness in it.

Diwali is the most important festival of India. It is the celebration of good over evil in the story of Ramayan. My painting Jatayu depicts one of the events from this story. The demon king Ravan abducts Sita and flies away in his private jet (Pushpak Vimana). The king of vultures, Jatayu—the mystical bird—notices this and tries to fight with Ravan. I have captured this critical incident in warm and cool colors—a bright trail following Sita and darkness left behind.

I used to always pick out a Christmas tree with my dad every year, and sometimes still do. After we find one, we grab a hot chocolate and cookies before heading home. At night—after the tree is up in the house—my mom and I grab boxes of ornaments to decorate it together while my dad and brother hang lights around the house. They all make the holidays feel so special, even in a warm California winter.

Diwali is the most important festival of India. It is the celebration of good over evil in the story of Ramayan. My painting shows the author of this text, Valmiki, meditating when he noticed a crane couple in love. Soon, one of the cranes is killed by a hunter's arrow. The other crane dies in agony. This disturbs Valmiki and a curse comes out of his mouth. This curse forms the basis of the rhythm of Ramayan.

## _Solstice Flora_

My animation portrays four important plants to many European pagan winter solstice traditions: evergreen trees, fly agaric mushroom, ivy, and holly. Evergreen trees are seen as symbols of life and balance, fly agaric was historically used in spiritual ceremony, ivy represents binding and protection, and holly represents the Holly King (a winter god whose power peaks at the solstice). As someone who celebrates solstices and equinoxes in the modern day, I find it important to represent them.
