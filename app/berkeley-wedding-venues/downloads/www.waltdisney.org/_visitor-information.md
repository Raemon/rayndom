Sketching in the Galleries

Due to the nature of our artifacts, pencil is the only medium allowed in the galleries. Complimentary pencils are available at Ticket Desk.

Additionally, while group sketch sessions are allowed, guests may **not****** charge others to join sketch sessions, or collect any personal revenue from meet-ups that occur on the museum’s property.

Service Animals

The Walt Disney Family Museum welcomes service animals. Under federal law, service animals are dogs trained to work or perform tasks for the benefit of people with physical or mental disabilities. The work or tasks performed by a service animal must be directly related to the handler’s disability. Additionally, service animals must remain under their handler’s control at all times while inside the museum. Dogs or any other type of animal or pet whose sole function is to provide comfort, companionship, or emotional support—such as a support animal—do not qualify as service animals under federal law and are not permitted in the museum. 

Security Bag Check + Prohibited Items

For the safety and security of the museum, guests, staff, and the artifacts, all bags and parcels are subject to inspection by Security. Prohibited items include weapons, knives, box cutters, scissors, flammable liquids, permanent markers, and spray paint. Security may not allow guests to bring in other items if they deem said items hazardous.
