For this free family event, we will explore the themes of community, togetherness, and collaboration with a variety of interactive activities and drawing delights. Visit our Learning Center to "get drawn into" the following activities: Create festive holiday cards, decorate your own paper tile for our community mosaic, animate a dancing character of your own design, and much more! In-gallery activities will also be available—included with the purchase of museum admission.

### Schedule of Events

#### Portraits of Your World | 10am–noon, 12:45–3pm | Learning Center | Digital Lab 

We often think of a portrait as a way to draw what someone looks like on the outside. This time, we will be drawing what we think and feel on the inside. Take part in this joint activity as you can draw yourself or you and a friend draw each other’s inner worlds, prompted by a series of fun questions! 

#### Community Paper Mosaic | 10am–noon, 12:45–3pm | Learning Center | Digital Lab 

Inspired by the colorful and vibrant works of concept artist Mary Blair, join us in our Community Paper Mosaic project. Decorate your own paper tile and add it to the collection created by our community. Together, it will be a dazzling display! 

#### Festive Card Crafting | 10am–12:45pm, 1:30–3pm | Learning Center | Art Studio 

It’s the time of year to get cozy and start crafting! Settle in and join us in decorating festive cards for the holiday season. 

#### Paper Dolls from Around the World | 10am–12:45pm, 1:30–3pm | Learning Center | Art Studio 

Drop by to make paper dolls using a wide variety of materials and textures! Choose, customize, and decorate to create an array of beautiful dolls from around the world. 

#### Drawings Come to Life | 10am–3pm | Theater

Blend the physical and virtual worlds as you create drawings that come to life. Draw your own characters and use Augmented Reality technology to watch as your characters dance before your eyes! 

#### What Fills Your Plate | 10am–3pm | Awards Lobby 

As the seasons change and the weather gets cooler, we tend to gather around the table for meals that bring us together. Share what fills up your plate and add it to our giant community plate display to see all of the mouth-watering meals our guests enjoy eating around the year. 

#### The Kindness Tree | 10am–3pm | Museum Galleries 

Featured in our galleries you will find The Kindness Tree, where acts of kindness and generosity are shared. Write or draw a kind moment you witnessed recently and “leaf” it on the branches of the tree to inspire those passing by. 

#### The Art Garden | 10am–3pm | Museum Galleries 

The Art Garden is an exchange of art with your community. Sketch a fun picture and plant it into The Art Garden for someone to take home! Harvest someone else’s work to take home with you. 

### About The Big Draw 2025

The Big Draw Festival 2025 is about celebrating the act of drawing, but most importantly, having fun! Join us for engaging drawing sessions and bring out the artist inside you. Drawn Together is about highlighting how creativity unites us and how collaboration and connection are at the heart of making art.
