Select Sundays this Autumn, The Walt Disney Family Museum presents special sensory-friendly film screenings of The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (1977). To make this film a comfortable experience for all, lights will be dimmed instead of off, volume will be slightly lowered, and closed captioning will be turned on. Guests are welcome to get up, walk around, sing, dance, and enjoy the film in whatever way is most comfortable to them.

### Additional Program Details

Film screenings are subject to change. If you’re unable to attend a film screening within the first 20 minutes of the film duration, please contact our Ticketing team at [tickets@wdfmuseum.org](mailto:tickets@wdfmuseum.org) for a refund.

Please note: Children under the age of 12 must be accompanied by an adult who shall be responsible for the child at all times. Tickets reserved for children under the age of 5 without an accompanying adult ticket in the same order will be automatically returned. Lapsitting infants under the age of 1 do not require an additional ticket.

### On-Sale Information

Tickets for this film will be available online beginning **Tuesday, October 7**.
