### Program Ticketing Policies

For ticketed programs and events, there is a limit of four tickets available for purchase per household, unless otherwise stated. This includes non-paid ticketed programs and events. The museum reserves the right to void tickets purchased in excess of this limit. In some instances, the museum will impose lower limits based on capacity of venue and/or special considerations.

Due to the overwhelming popularity of programs and events at the museum, tickets often sell out quickly. The museum does not collect waitlists for programs or events; however, if tickets to a sold-out program or event become available, they will be released for purchase on the museum’s website at 10am the day before the event.

If you have purchased tickets to a program or event and are no longer able to attend, you may donate your tickets back to the museum for resale. In order to do so, please send an email to [tickets@wdfmuseum.org](mailto:tickets@wdfmuseum.org) by 10am, one day before the program or event and provide the confirmation number you received when purchasing the tickets within the body of the email. After 10am one day prior to the program or event, we can no longer accept tickets for donation. Tickets for donation cannot be accepted over the phone or in person at the Ticket Desk.

Please note: Children under the age of 12 must be accompanied by an adult who shall be responsible for the child at all times. Tickets reserved for children under the age of 5 without an accompanying adult ticket in the same order will be automatically returned. Lapsitting infants under the age of 1 do not require an additional ticket.
