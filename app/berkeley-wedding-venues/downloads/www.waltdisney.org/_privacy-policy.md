# Privacy Policy

The Walt Disney Family Museum is concerned about protecting the privacy of all of our website visitors. We respect your privacy and your choice not to have your personal information shared with other people. Please read the following to learn more about our policy. Your use of our website indicates your acceptance of this Privacy Policy. 

### Collection of Information

The Walt Disney Family Museum does not collect personally identifying data such as names, addresses, email addresses, and the like, except when voluntarily submitted by website visitors.

In only four situations do we request personally identifying data from site visitors: purchases made in the online Museum Store; online purchases of admission and event tickets; online employment applications; and event space rental inquiries. We may collect information that is used to make our website more useful by helping us learn about the number of visitors to our site and the types of technology our visitors use, but we do not track or record information about individuals and their visits. We may compile and report aggregate statistics about our users—such as numbers, traffic patterns, and related site information—but these statistics include no personally identifying information.

### Disclosure of Information

The Walt Disney Family Museum will not disclose or share any personal information you provide to us with any other party without your permission, except if requested to do so in accordance with a court order, subpoena, or similar legal order, and in the event such disclosure is necessary to protect the rights, property, and safety of us, our users, and other third parties. We will not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others.

### Third-party Processing

Purchases made in our online Museum Store, online purchases of admission and event tickets, and online employment applications are processed by third parties who handle all related ordering, processing, and delivery of the products. The third parties’ practices in connection with the ordering, processing, and delivery of products are subject to their own privacy policies. You should consult the privacy policies for the Museum Store and online ticket sales at [gatewayticketing.com/privacy.asp ](http://www.gatewayticketing.com/privacy.asp)and online employment applications on our [employment page](http://waltdisney.org/employment) to ascertain the uses of the personal information submitted to these third parties.

### Links

The Walt Disney Family Museum may provide links to other third-party websites, and other websites may provide links to our website. Third-party websites operate according to their own terms of use and privacy policies. We have no control over such third-party websites, and therefore you acknowledge and agree that The Walt Disney Family Museum is not responsible for the availability of such third-party sites and does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for any content, advertising, products, or other materials on or available from such sites. You further acknowledge and agree that The Walt Disney Family Museum will not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such content, advertising, products, or other materials on or available from such sites.

### Cookies and Similar Electronic Tags

As is the case with many sites, when you visit our site and complete a registration form, we will place a cookie on your computer, which helps us identify you more quickly when you return. Cookies are small pieces of information stored by your browser on your computer’s hard drive and are used in website system administration to keep track of movement of an individual from one screen to another. We will use cookies alone or in conjunction with other devices described below to understand how you arrived at our website, to determine which pages or information you find most useful or interesting at our own website, and to make choices about how to deliver the most relevant marketing messages about our products to you. This information may also be used by our staff to detect and resolve website problems and to assist with customer support concerns.

Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser settings to prevent acceptance of a cookie offered by a website. If you experience any problems using our website, please contact the [Web Team](mailto:connect@wdfmuseum.org).

We may also use transparent GIF files or pixel tags and similar technologies to help manage online advertising. These files, which are provided by our third-party advertising management partners, enable our advertising management partners to recognize a unique cookie on your web browser. This in turn allows our advertising management partners to provide us with data concerning visitors’ activities on our site, track and measure the performance of our marketing efforts, and assist in the delivery of relevant marketing messages. These technologies are placed by us or by another third party who works with our ad management partners to provide these services. With both cookies and pixel tag technology, the information that we collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address. For more information about advertising networks, including information about how to opt out of these technologies, please contact our [Web Team](mailto:connect@wdfmuseum.org).
