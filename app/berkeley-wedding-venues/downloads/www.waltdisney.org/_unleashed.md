Cost

FREE 

Date

Nov 16, 2023–Mar 24, 2024 

Location

Theater Gallery and Lower Lobby 

The Walt Disney Family Museum is pleased to announce  _Pawsibilities Unleashed: A Pet Portrait Exhibition_. Presented concurrently with our special exhibition,  _Disney Cats & Dogs_, this unique collection of artworks will feature portraits by local Bay Area and Disney-related artists, showcasing the profound impact animal companions have on their creative expression.  _Pawsibilities Unleashed_ will also showcase animal-related collectibles from Walt’s personal collection in addition to rare, non-English language posters from an array of classic, animal-centric Disney films. 

This original exhibition is co-curated by Tracie Timmer, Public Programs Manager, and Marina Villar Delgado, Director of Collection and Exhibitions, and will be on view in the museum’s Theater Gallery and Lower Lobby beginning Thursday, November 16, 2023, through March 2024, and will be free to the public. 

Pets bring entertainment, comfort, and companionship for so many of us, and for artists, they can also be a source of great inspiration. “With the success of  _Disney Cats and Dogs_ , we hoped to find more ways to bring the joy of pets to our museum guests,” says Timmer. “We also sought to highlight the talented Disney Legends and artists who have contributed to many beloved animal characters in Disney films over the years, including Pete Docter, Andreas Deja, John Musker, and many more, alongside local artists who have immortalized pets of all shapes and sizes with their distinctive creativity and vision. As you will discover in this exhibition, one common theme rings true in each of these unique artworks—they encapsulate the special bond that humans and animals share.” 

Walt Disney loved, respected, and appreciated animals from a very young age and found many ways to incorporate them into his films, television shows, and other projects throughout his lifetime. Even in the early days of the Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio—known today as The Walt Disney Company—Walt would create roles for his Uncle Robert Disney’s German Shepherd, Peggy. Her live-action debut in the Alice Comedies in 1924 marked the first on-screen appearance of a Disney pet, and she quickly became an audience favorite. 

Walt once said, “Sometimes we recognize ourselves in animals. And that’s what makes them so interesting.” This sentiment rings true for the talented artists and their animal-inspired artworks featured in  _Pawsibilities Unleashed_. Featured in the exhibition are works created by some of Walt Disney’s grandchildren and great-grandchildren: Chris Miller, Walter Miller, and Lily Miller.

_Pawsibilities Unleashed_ and  _Disney Cats & Dogs _are presented in conjunction with this year’s celebration of The Walt Disney Company’s 100th anniversary. 

_Pawsibilities Unleashed: A Pet Portrait Exhibition_ will be on view in the museum’s Theater Gallery and Lower Lobby beginning Thursday, November 16, 2023 through March 2024, and is open free to the public.
