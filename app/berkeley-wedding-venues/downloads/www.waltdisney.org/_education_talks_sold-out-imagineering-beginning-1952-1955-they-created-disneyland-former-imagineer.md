### Tom K. Morris

As one of the Creative Development leaders at Walt Disney Imagineering for many years, **Tom K. Morris** was responsible for overseeing many new ideas and attraction concepts, most recently as creative director for Cars Land, which opened in June 2012 at Disney California Adventure Park.

Morris began his Disney career in 1973 as a teenager, working with a third-party lessee at Disneyland. He transferred to Disneyland Operations and worked as an Attractions Host for such Tomorrowland attractions as _Submarine Voyage_ , _Autopia_ , and _Space Mountain_.

Moving to Walt Disney Imagineering in 1979, his first assignment was _Journey Into Imagination_ for EPCOT Center at Walt Disney World Resort in Florida. After its completion in 1982, Morris returned to California and worked on numerous proposals and concepts for Disneyland expansion projects, including _Videopolis_ , _Splash Mountain_ , _Star Tours®_ , and _Indiana Jones® Adventure_.

Beginning in 1987, he provided creative direction for teams of artists and engineers as Show Producer for the development of Fantasyland and _Le Château de la Belle au Bois Dormant_ (Sleeping Beauty Castle) at Disneyland Paris. Following the opening of the Park in 1992, he assumed responsibility for the development of 10 new attractions there, and provided on-going creative direction to the local team of Walt Disney Imagineering.

Starting in 1995, Morris was part of the conceptual team that developed DisneyQuest, a new concept in interactive family entertainment at Walt Disney World. At that time, he also had a hand in the development of _Rock ‘n’ Roller Coaster Starring Aerosmith_ at the Disney-MGM Studios Theme Park at Walt Disney World in Florida. He then transitioned onto the Hong Kong Disneyland project where he led the creative development of the first phase of the theme park, which opened in September 2005.

Morris is currently involved in several Disneyland- and Walt Disney Imagineering-related history projects.
