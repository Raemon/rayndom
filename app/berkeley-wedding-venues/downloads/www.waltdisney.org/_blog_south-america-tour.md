# South America Tour

Posted on Wed, 07/31/2024 - 14:36

#### On view in August 2024.

To celebrate Walt's South America Goodwill trip taken in 1941, we have Walt and Lillian's passports on display for a limited time in our Awards Lobby. The passports include country stamps and Uruguayan money from their trip.

In the 1940s, amidst the growing international conflict that became World War II, the United States government became concerned with fostering good relationships with our neighboring countries to the South. The Good Neighbor Program, which was established in the 30s, began looking for fresh candidates to be ambassadors. This initiative—specifically aimed at improving relations with Latin American countries—emphasized non-intervention and cooperation instead of military intervention. One method of achieving this was to recruit American celebrities to be cultural ambassadors, and so Walt Disney was recruited in 1941.

The offer to collaborate with the Good Neighbor Policy came at the perfect time and Walt quickly selected 15 staff members to accompany him and his wife Lillian on tour. As the tour traveled through the various countries of South America, the group was received warmly by their hosts. Walt Disney was an international celebrity and received gifts, met with politicians, and participated in an endless stream of events commemorating his visit. One such event took place in Uruguay's capital city, Montevideo, where schools were closed for the day and hundreds of young children gathered to meet Walt at the Trocadero Theatre. This event was a complete surprise to Walt, and he happily embraced the fanfare and listened as several children read him letters they had written expressing their love for Disney cartoons and music. For the main event, Walt and the school children sat down and enjoyed a special advanced screening of _Dumbo_ (1941).
