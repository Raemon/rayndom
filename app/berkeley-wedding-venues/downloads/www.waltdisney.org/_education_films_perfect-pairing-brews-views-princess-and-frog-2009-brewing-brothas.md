### About Brewing with Brothas

Brewing with Brothas started out as an idea during a birthday camping trip, and is now a Black-owned craft brewery located in Belmont, CA, creating a wide variety of beers, from Belgian-style ales to seasonal brews. Driven by their passion for beer, co-founders, Denzel Jackson and RiSean "Bookie" Tinsley began brewing every week in their hometown, East Palo Alto. A year later, their Black Belgian Tripel or BB3, won first place at Taplands 2020 Homebrew competition in Santa Clara, California. Their brewing has since continued growing momentum with more than 20 collaborations with other craft breweries across the state. Denzel and Bookie remain humble in their pursuit of opening a brewery in their hometown one day. Rooted in community and collaboration, their values are showcased in how they carry themselves and their products.

### About Perfect Pairing

Raise your glass to a new film series at The Walt Disney Family Museum, Perfect Pairing, where we match a Californian wine, beer, or spirit with classic and contemporary Disney films. Join us in our  _Fantasia_ -themed theater for an exploration of locally made beverages and delicious treats provided by [Peter's Kettle Corn](http://peterskettlecorn.com/) paired to complement the settings, themes, and characters of our monthly selected film.
