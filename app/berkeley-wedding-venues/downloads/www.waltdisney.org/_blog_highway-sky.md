The  _Disneyland Monorail System_ is one of many great examples of Walt Disney turning his dreams into reality. As fate would have it, Walt noticed a monorail train on a trip to Germany and immediately envisioned it as the transportation system of the future, and knew he wanted one in his park. With the help of the Alweg company in Germany, this dream came to Disneyland on June 14, 1959. It opened as part of the great 1959 expansion, along with the  _Submarine Voyage_ and  _Matterhorn Bobsleds_.

The attraction’s original title was the  _Disneyland-Alweg Monorail System_ —Alweg being an abbreviation for Axel Lennart Wenner-Gren, the founder of Alweg. Imagineer and Disney Legends Bob Gurr—best known for designing many Disneyland vehicles—and Roger Broggie—a mechanical engineer with an enthusiasm for railroading—worked together to design the trains. Unlike its predecessor the  _Viewliner_ , the  _Monorail_ ran above the ground on a beam, giving it the nickname “Highway in the Sky,” an appropriate name for the very first daily operating monorail system in the Western Hemisphere.

Years after Walt’s vision became reality, in December of 1986, the  _Monorail_ was honored as a historical mechanical engineering landmark by The American Society of Mechanical Engineers. An official plaque was erected at the Tomorrowland Station and states “the cars are equipped with 600 Volt D.C. 100 HP electric motors driving rubber tired wheels on a single beam trackway”—you can still see the plaque when you visit Disneyland today.

The first  _Monorail_ vehicles were known as Mark I models, which had two separate cars with three cabins each plus nose cone and tail cone sections. Each front car had a bubble-like windshield at to give the pilot clear view of the surroundings. The trains were known as  _Monorail_ Red and  _Monorail_ Blue.

When the  _Monorail_ first opened, Tomorrowland station was the only open arrival and departure point. Guests would travel roundtrip around Tomorrowland soaring by the  _Autopia_ tracks and the  _Submarine_ lagoon, in a just-under-a-mile’s distance loop. These electrically-propelled trains were almost silent as they passed by, which did not distract guests as they roamed the park.

Bob Gurr told a story, featured on our blog, about the  _Monorail_ ’s opening day in 1959 when Bob was the pilot for the opening ceremony, and then Vice President Richard Nixon was on hand with his wife and two daughters to inaugurate the new attraction. During the rehearsal of the ribbon-cutting ceremony, Walt suggested that Bob give Vice President Nixon a ride. Bob obliged, but as he came back around the circuit he realized that all of the Secret Service agents were still on the platform, meaning he had, in essence, “kidnapped” the Vice President of the United States for a brief time.

In June 1961, the  _Monorail_ was improved in several ways. First, the Mark I was replaced by a new model, the Mark II. Each car had four cabins instead of three to accommodate more passengers. There were now three trains: Red and Blue remained with  _Monorail_ Gold debuting as the third. An even bigger “bubble” windshield was used on these new trains to give an even better view, while nose and tail cone viewing remained. The Mark II Red and Blue can be seen right here on our Disneyland model. The track was expanded to go outside of Tomorrowland to the Disneyland Hotel and became two and a half miles in length. Instead of just the one station, guests could now board and disembark at the Tomorrowland Station and the Disneyland Hotel Station, which created a whole new way to enter Disneyland.

Situated at the front of the train,  _Monorail_ pilots had no need to control turns on the train, but they do control the speed of the train and whether it moves forward or backward, giving two honks of the horn when moving forward and three while going backward. One honk meant an acknowledgement, such as when they honked at their engineer friends on the Disneyland Railroad. When the trains were done for the day, they would be taken to the  _Monorail_ Shop above the steam train roundhouse to rest for the night.

The Mark IIs were replaced by the Mark III in 1969, while today the Mark VII (seven) soars above Walt’s original Magic Kingdom.  _Monorail_ trains were also installed at Walt Disney World Resort thanks to Walt’s vision of a  _Monorail_ system in EPCOT, his Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow. At Walt Disney World Resort, rather than serving as an attraction, the  _Monorail_ trains are used to transport guests between Resorts and the Parks. Today, we can all appreciate Walt’s admiration for transportation in innovation with the introduction of the  _Monorail System_. Much like many of Walt’s dreams, the  _Monorail_ keeps moving forward.
