# _Walt Disney Treasures_ : Lillian Disney's Tea Set

Posted on Tue, 08/19/2025 - 10:37

#### On view mid-August–October 19, 2025

To celebrate the release of our new book,  _Walt Disney Treasures: Personal Art and Artifacts from The Walt Disney Family Museum_ , we are displaying rare and unique objects from the collection that are also featured in the book. Some of the artifacts showcased in the book and here have never been seen by the public. These objects will be on view for free in the museum’s Awards Lobby and will rotate periodically through the beginning of 2025. The next installation in this series celebrates the significant contributions of Lillian Disney.

These teacups and saucers were used by Walt and Lilly in their Disneyland apartment located above the Fire Station on Main Street, U.S.A., which was designed as a private retreat for Walt and his family. A major design motif in the apartment—reflected in these ceramics—are flowers, specifically roses, which were one of Lilly’s favorites. “When Dad would travel, they’d go into little antique shops,” explained their daughter Diane. “Mother collected cranberry glass, and cranberry is the color that dominates this apartment. It was this little microcosm of the Victorian world in cranberry red—it was gorgeous.” These sets are an intimate insight into the aesthetic tastes of Walt and Lilly, who used the apartment to enjoy family time. 

On July 13, 2025, Walt and Lilly’s 100th wedding anniversary, a new window display was unveiled on Main Street, U.S.A., advertising “Lilly’s Bountiful Blooms, Flowers & Fancies” in honor of Lilly’s contributions to Disneyland and love of gardening. One of the highest honors at The Walt Disney Company, the tradition of honoring individuals with a personalized decorative window on Main Street, U.S.A. was started by Walt Disney and continues today at Disney Parks worldwide. In celebration of the Park's 70th anniversary, original furniture from Walt and Lillian's Disneyland apartment on loan from The Walt Disney Family Museum, debuted in the new exhibit in the Opera House, "Evolution of a Dream."
