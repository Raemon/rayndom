# Virtual Tour and Museum Highlights

Anyone in the world can experience and enjoy The Walt Disney Family Museum with our Virtual Tour and Museum Highlights. Benefitting from a wide range of embedded digital media content—including exclusive archived audio clips from a 1956 interview with Walt—the Virtual Tour brings Walt’s inspirational message directly to people’s streamable devices. Guests of all ages can learn about Walt’s early endeavors and struggles, his storytelling principles, and the technological innovations that made classics like  _Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs_(1937) possible. Narrated by voiceover artists and producing partners Camille Dixon and Bill Rogers—recognized for their contributions to commercial broadcasts and theme parks—the Virtual Tour will be offered free to the public on the museum’s website and the WDFM app for a limited time.

The Virtual Tour was soft-launched in a live format by the museum’s Education Department in 2019, and initially designed for school groups. High-resolution videos of the galleries were merged with Disney film clips and narrated by a museum educator, allowing for a more customized experience for students unable to visit the museum due to geographic or financial constraints. Since the live Virtual Tour’s debut, the museum has been able to reach classrooms across the world, including a homeschool in South Africa.

In light of the museum’s temporary closure, The Walt Disney Family Museum team recently transformed the Virtual Tour into an immersive experience for people of all ages who wish to visit the museum and learn about Walt’s life in a streamable format.

To view the Virtual Tour, download the [WDFM mobile app](https://www.waltdisney.org/wdfm-mobile-app) or view the video directly below.
