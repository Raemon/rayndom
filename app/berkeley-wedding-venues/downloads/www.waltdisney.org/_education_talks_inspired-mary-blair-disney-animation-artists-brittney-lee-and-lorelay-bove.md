### About the Speakers

![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)

### Brittney Lee

**Brittney Lee** (Production Designer)**** joined Walt Disney Animation Studios in 2010, working on _Wreck-It Ralph_ (2012) and the Academy Award®-winning short _Paperman_ (2012). As a visual development artist on the Oscar®-winning feature, _Frozen_ (2013), Lee was responsible for providing foundation designs for the colorful cast of characters—helping to design costumes and hairstyles—and also contributed to the interior design of Elsa’s extraordinary ice palace. Continuing in her role as a visual development artist, she also provided designs and concepts for the Oscar®-winning _Zootopia_ (2016), in addition to _Moana_ (2016), _Frozen 2_ (2019) and _Raya and the Last Dragon_ (2021). She was production designer on the virtual reality short film, _Myth: A Frozen Tale_ (2019), and is currently production designer on the highly anticipated _Frozen 3_ , coming to theaters in 2027

Lee also provided illustrations for the 2019 Disney Press publication, _Mary Blair’s Unique Flair: The Girl Who Became One of the Disney Legends_.

Prior to joining Disney, Lee spent several years as an artist for Three Rings Design, a small game company in San Francisco, California. She attended the school of film and animation at New York’s Rochester Institute of Technology, studying character animation—a career she knew she would pursue from the moment she saw _The Little Mermaid_ (1989) at age six.

### Lorelay Bové

**Lorelay Bové** (Production Designer) worked in visual development for the Academy Award®-winning films _Big Hero 6_ (2014) and _Zootopia_ (2016) and was associate production designer on the Oscar®-winning feature _Encanto_ (2021). She also contributed her talents as lead designer of “Sugar Rush” for _Wreck-It Ralph_(2012). Her other Walt Disney Animation Studios credits include influential visual direction and development roles on _The Princess and the Frog_ (2009), _Tangled_ (2010), _Winnie the Pooh_ (2011),_Raya and the Last Dragon_ (2021), and the short film _Tangled Ever After_ (2012), in addition to the Emmy Award®-winning _Prep & Landing_ television specials. She is currently serving as a production designer on an unannounced Disney Animation project in development.

Born in Barcelona, Spain, and raised in the principality of Andorra, Bové is part of a family of gifted artists—her father is renowned painter Quim Bové—and art has always been a way of life for her. After graduating in 2007 from the prestigious CalArts, she made her entry into animation as an art intern at Pixar Animation Studios.

In addition to her visual development work for Disney Animation films, Bové has also provided illustrations for several Little Golden Books, including _The Princess and the Frog_ , _Toy Story: Ride ‘em Cowboy_!, and _Wreck-It Ralph_. Bové is the illustrator of the Walt Disney Animation Studios Artist Showcase book _No Slurping, No Burping!: A Tale of Table Manners_. She has also created artwork for each of Walt Disney Records’ 12 albums in _The Legacy Collection_.
