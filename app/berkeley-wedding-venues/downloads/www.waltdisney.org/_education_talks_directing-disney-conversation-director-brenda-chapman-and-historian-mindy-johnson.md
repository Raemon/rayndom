In conjunction with our current special exhibition,  _Directing at Disney_ , we are excited to present an in-depth conversation with Academy Award®, BAFTA®, and Golden Globe®-winning director Brenda Chapman. After beginning her career as a story artist at Walt Disney Animation Studios in 1987 and receiving a story credit on _Beauty and the Beast_(1991), Brenda served as head of story on _The Lion King_(1994), helped launch DreamWorks Animation Studios, wrote and directed Disney and Pixar’s award-winning feature film  _Brave_ (2012), and storyboarded and consulted on several more Pixar Animation Studios films.

Chapman will share insights and stories from her impressive career with Mindy Johnson, a preeminent expert on women in early animation.

### Mindy Johnson

Award-winning author, historian, filmmaker, and preeminent expert on women in early animation, **Mindy Johnson’s** groundbreaking book, _Ink & Paint – The Women of Walt Disney’s Animation_ (Disney Editions), redefines our collective history. This essential volume casts a light on the thousands of unsung female artists behind the creative and technical advances within the animated art form. Recipient of the ASIFA June Foray “Annie” Award, and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences - AMPAS/Oscars.org Film Scholar Award, along with the ASIFA-Hollywood Animation Educators Forum Grant, Johnson continues research into the earliest women of animation with a forthcoming book & film entitled _The Only Woman Animator – Bessie Mae Kelley & Women at the Dawn of an Industry_. Notably, Johnson unearthed the oldest-surviving hand-drawn animated and directed films by a woman. This game-changing discovery of Bessie Mae Kelley and her early work at the dawn of animation redefines the established understanding of our collective past. Kelley’s restored films debuted in their World Premiere at the Academy Motion Picture Museum in Los Angeles—100 years after their creation. 

Johnson’s young-reader volume entitled _Pencils, Pens & Brushes – A Great Girls’ Guide to Disney Animation_, celebrates the contributions of 20 remarkable women within early Disney animation and is a treasure for all ages. Her critically acclaimed debut book, _Tinker Bell – An Evolution_ was honored with rare consecutive Family Choice Awards, and she is a contributing writer for the epic Taschen volume, _The Walt Disney Film Archives – The Animated Movies: 1921–1968_ as well as the celebrated Disney Editions collection, _Marc Davis: Walt Disney’s Renaissance Man_. 

A sought-after commentator, speaker, lecturer, and panelist, Johnson explores a wide range of subjects within her presentations and appearances at numerous studios, campuses, international festivals, and conferences including: The Smithsonian Speakers Series, The Pordenone Silent Film Festival, Anahuac Int’l Design Conference, Hippfest, Ottawa Int’l Animation Festival, NAFF Festival, Lucasfilm, DreamWorks, TCM Classic Film Festival, Film Forum-NYC, D23: The Ultimate Disney Fan Event, ABC Network specials, San Diego Comic-Con, CTN Expo, World Animation Festival, and more. Johnson has also written for numerous international publications and produced record-breaking global campaigns for the film industry. 

Johnson’s creative work extends to a wide range of film projects including associate producing the award-winning documentary _Pencils vs. Pixels_ (2024), in addition to creative work and appearances for clients, including: AMPAS/Oscars.org, TCM/Turner Broadcasting, WNET/American Masters, History Channel, ABC Television SPARK Animation Fest-Vancouver, The Walt Disney Family Museum, The Walt Disney Company, HoriPro Entertainment, Pixar Animation Studios, Stage 9 Exhibits, Sony Animation, Primary Wave, SiriusXM Radio, and more.

In addition to her work in network television and film production, Johnson is also an award-winning playwright, Grammy-nominated songwriter, musician, and a contributing artist on several internationally acclaimed recordings.
