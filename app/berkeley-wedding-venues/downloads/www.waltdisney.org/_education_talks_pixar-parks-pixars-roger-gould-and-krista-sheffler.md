### Roger Gould

**Roger Gould** is a Creative Director at both Pixar Animation Studios and Walt Disney Animation Studios leading their deep collaboration with Walt Disney Imagineering to bring the wonderfully imaginative Pixar and Disney Animation characters and worlds to three-dimensional life at Disney theme parks, resorts and cruise ships around the globe. 

Having dreamt of being an animator from a young age, his dream came true when he joined Walt Disney Animation Studios in 1994 on _“_ Hercules”, creating the computer animated 30-headed Hydra. 

In 2001, he joined Pixar Animation Studios directing short films such as “Mike’s New Car” and “Boudin’”. In 2003, Gould founded Pixar’s Theme Parks group focusing full time on Imagineering projects. This collaboration takes projects from concept to opening day, engaging filmmakers and Imagineers to ensure these projects feel like natural extensions of the movies. Gould is thrilled to been part of many award winning experiences including “Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage”, “Toy Story Mania!”, “Cars Land”, “Toy Story Land”, “Remy’s Ratatouille Adventure” and “Pixar Pier”.

In 2014, Gould launched Disney Animation’s Creative Legacy team expanding his collaboration with WDI to include Disney Animation stories. Notable projects include “Frozen Ever After”, Shanghai Disneyland’s “Zootopia: Hot Pursuit”, Hong Kong Disneyland’s “World of Frozen” and Tokyo DisneySeas’ “Fantasy Springs”, “Peter Pan’s Never Land Adventure” and “Rapunzel’s Lantern Festival”.

Sheffler has worked on a wide variety of projects including “Toy Story Mania,” “Cars Land,” “Nemo and Friends Searider”, “Remy’s Ratatouille Adventure” and the Pixar Place Hotel.

A Disneyland fan from a very young age, Sheffler worked as a part of the Disneyland College Program in the costuming department.
