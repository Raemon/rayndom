# _Conserving the Magic of Our Planet: A Virtual Community Art Exhibition_

Date

Virtual Exhibition Open Now 

**“Conservation isn’t just the business of a few people. It’s a matter that concerns all of us. It’s a science whose principles are written in the oldest code in the world, the laws of nature. The natural resources of our vast continent are not inexhaustible. But if we will use our riches wisely, if we will protect our wildlife and preserve our lakes and streams, these things will last us for generations to come.”**

—Walt Disney

### About Virtual Community Art Exhibitions

This exhibition is the third in a series of virtual community art exhibitions sponsored by the museum during our pandemic-related closure that began in March 2020. The first exhibition,  _The World of Tomorrow_ , called upon amateur and professional artists of all ages to share their ideas and hopes for our future. The second exhibition,_it’s a small world,_ invited the museum’s global community to share their visions for a just and equitable present. 

All submissions will be entered in a juried pool for display in a virtual 3D rendering of the Diane Disney Miller Exhibition Hall, which has previously housed such world-class exhibitions as _Disney and Dalí: Architects of the Imagination_ ; _MAGIC, COLOR, FLAIR: The World of Mary Blair_ ; _Water to Paper, Paint to Sky: The Art of Tyrus Wong_ ; and _Mickey Mouse: From Walt to the World_. The final selection of works for _Conserving the Magic of Our Planet: Virtual Community Art Exhibition_ will be made on view on the museum’s website and the WDFM mobile app.
