# Objects On Loan for “Evolution of a Dream” at Disneyland 

Posted on Fri, 07/11/2025 - 16:35

There is an all-new gallery experience in the lobby at the Opera House on Main Street, U.S.A. called "Evolution of a Dream,” celebrating 70 years of Disneyland’s history. This exhibit showcases some never-before-seen artwork and artifacts highlighting early Disneyland merchandise, the groundbreaking history of _Audio-Animatronics®_ technology, and a tribute to Cast Members who brought Walt's dream to life over the past seven decades. In a special collaboration, The Walt Disney Family Museum loaned more than 30 artifacts, including awards that highlight Walt’s varied career and original furniture from Walt’s private apartment—on view at Disneyland for the first time.

#### Apartment Furniture

Walt had an apartment built above the Fire Station on Main Street, U.S.A. where he could work and have a place for him and his family to stay. Academy Award®-winning set decorator, Emilie Kuri, was selected to furnish and style Walt’s apartment in a Victorian theme to match the era of Main Street, U.S.A. The furnishings and decor of the apartment were heavily inspired by Lillian Disney’s collection of cranberry glass. 

In the early 1980s, the Disney family reclaimed the original furniture and most of the decorations that furnished the apartment. Now, a selection of original furniture and decor is on display in a breathtaking recreation of Walt’s apartment. 

The teams at Disneyland and The Walt Disney Family Museum worked together to create faithful facsimiles of decorations and furniture items to give Guests a picture-perfect view inside the apartment where Walt resided when he visited Disneyland.

##  Awards 

Through Walt’s many awards, Guests can discover the diverse qualities that shaped the man behind the brand. By experiencing the exhibit “Evolution of a Dream” and the new attraction “Walt Disney – A Magical Life,” visitors of all ages will gain a deeper understanding of who Walt Disney truly was—a dreamer who embodied the American spirit, persevered through setbacks, and ultimately earned the admiration and recognition of the public during his lifetime. 

### Conservation Awards

A selection of awards highlighting Walt’s many achievements and humanitarian efforts were selected to accompany the apartment display. In the 1950s, Walt was concerned with the vanishing frontiers around the world. He recognized the importance of inspiring young generations to not only understand but preserve the natural world and the creatures sharing our planet. Through his filmmaking, he championed conservation work with powerful storytelling in his True-Life Adventures nature documentary series, earning eight Academy Awards® along the way.

#### National Wildlife Federation, The National Wildlife Federation Special award, 1957

During National Wildlife Week in 1957, the National Wildlife Federation (NWF) awarded Walt with a special award for his “distinguished service to our country by his outstanding work in the protection, conservation, and restoration of our soil, waters, woods, and wildlife.” 

Walt would go on to serve as the honorary chairman of the National Wildlife Federation for 11 years. He created public service announcements that helped to support and promote National Wildlife Week. In his 1957 public service announcement, he called upon viewers: “Won’t you do your part and protect your very good neighbors—the wildlife that is around you?”

#### Racing Pigeon Association, For the Greatest Contribution Ever Made to the Sport of Racing Pigeons, _The Pigeon that Worked a Miracle_ Award, 1958

Walt took an interest in the sport of pigeon racing and decided to produce a segment about it on his weekly television show, the then-titled _Walt Disney Presents_. The episode, “The Pigeon That Worked a Miracle,” was a light adaptation of the book _Pigeon Fly Home_ by Thomas Liggett. 

In the episode, Chad—a twelve-year-old boy—sustained an injury during a baseball game and was confined to a wheelchair. The doctors are convinced that his paralysis is psychosomatic and triggered by fear because Chad is too afraid to attempt to walk again. During this time, he picks up a new hobby of raising and training pigeons. When his favorite pigeon, Pidge, is in peril, the desire to save Pidge gives Chad the determination and strength to get out of his wheelchair and walk again. 

In the episode, The Santa Barbara-Ventura Racing Pigeon Combine was called upon to provide the pigeons needed and to organize the pigeon release for the climactic race. 

After the episode was released, The Nation Pigeon Association presented Walt Disney with the James R. Laimore Award. This award is presented to the person who, in the opinion of the committee, has done the most service to pigeons that year. Engraved on the plaque it reads: 

> “To Walt Disney for the Greatest Single Contribution Ever Made to the Sport of Racing Pigeons 
> 
> ‘The Pigeon That Worked a Miracle’"

The Ontario Humane Society provides various services related to animal welfare, including sheltering, adopting, and offering humane education.

#### San Diego Zoological Society, Contributions to Worldwide Support of Conservation Award, 1966

This eye-catching award—an artistic sculpted gorilla cast in metal—was awarded to Walt in 1966 from the San Diego Zoological Society, today known as the San Diego Zoo. In celebration of the Zoo’s 50th anniversary, they recognized Walt’s contributions to the worldwide support of conservation. 

In 1956, Walt shared, “You’ve probably heard people talk about conservation. Well, conservation isn’t just the business of a few people. It’s a matter that concerns all of us. It’s a science whose principles are written in the oldest code in the world, the laws of nature. The natural resources of our vast continent are not inexhaustible. But if we will use our riches wisely, if we will protect our wildlife and preserve our lakes and streams, these things will last us for generations to come.”

### Academic Awards

Walt attended just one year of high school before leaving formal education behind in 1918 to serve in the American Red Cross to aid France in the aftermath of World War I. He pieced together a practical education through his own life experiences, using the world as his classroom. Walt’s later global success caught the attention of several prestigious universities—Harvard University, Yale University, University of Southern California (USC), and University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)—who chose to honor him with honorary degrees. 

In awarding Walt these prestigious honorary degrees, these universities recognized that the world had a lot to learn from Walt and his creativity. While Walt did not himself partake in higher education, he had a love for learning and wanted to share his endless curiosities with the public. When he gained the resources, he put his animators through an animation training program at the Chouinard Art Institute. In 1961, after being a longtime supporter of Chouinard, Walt and his brother Roy formed California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) by merging Chouinard Art Institute and the Los Angeles Conservatory of Music. “CalArts is the principal thing I hope to leave when I move on to greener pastures,” Walt shared. “If I can help provide a place to develop the talent of the future, I think I will have accomplished something.”

#### Harvard University, Honorary Master of Arts Degree from Harvard University, 1938

At the 1938 graduation ceremony Walt was honored with an honorary Master of Arts degree from Harvard. In the dedication speech, Harvard’s president shared, “Walt Disney is a magician who has created a modern dwelling for the Muses...”

#### Yale University, Honorary Master of Art Degree from Yale University, 1938

In bestowing this honorary degree to Walt in 1938, Yale declared Walt to be the "creator of a new language of art" who had "the originality characteristic of genius." As for Walt, shortly before receiving the honorary degree, he said, "I'm a very uneducated man, a graduate of the school of hard knocks. I went as far as high school and art school in Chicago, but that was all."

#### University of Southern California, Honorary Master of Science Degree from University of Southern California, 1938

Even though Walt never went to college, he was a proud supporter of the University of Southern California. In 1934, he was a founding member of the Trojaneers Booster Club—a group composed of men who did not go to college, but gave jobs to those who did. Walt regularly attended football games at USC and became the president of the Trojaneers in 1939. 

In 1938, USC presented Walt with a Master of Science degree. USC’s president spoke of Walt’s achievement in “bringing to youngsters the spirit of innocent childhood and bringing to oldsters a bit of their second childhood.”

### Patriotic Awards 

Walt’s love for America has always been reflected in Main Street, U.S.A.’s Opera House. In 1965, “Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln” debuted here as part of Disneyland’s Tencennial celebration—introduced with complimentary admission. Each ticket read, “So young people may have a better knowledge of the man who played such an important part in American history.” 60 years after “Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln” opened, many of the awards on display in the “Evolution of a Dream” exhibit recognize Walt’s own lasting contributions to the United States.

Founded in 1910 and chartered by the United States Congress in 1916, the Boy Scouts of America—now known as Scouting America—prepares young people to make ethical and moral choices over their lifetimes by instilling in them values including loyalty, kindness, and bravery. 

Walt had been a Boy Scout in 1914 when his family lived in Kansas City, Missouri. He joined a Boy Scout troop from Sunday school classes in the Congregational church that the Disney family attended. He was at the Tenderfoot rank when he left the Boy Scouts due to his family moving back to Chicago, IL. 

In 1946, the Boy Scouts awarded Walt with their highest honor, the Silver Buffalo Award. In 1955, they honored him again with this award.

#### Presidential Medal of Freedom, 1964

In September 1964, Walt Disney was presented with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Lyndon B. Johnson at a ceremony in the East Room of the White House. Walt was described as: “Artist and impresario, in the course of entertaining an age, he has created an American folklore.” Walt was one of 30 recipients to receive this high distinction. At the ceremony featuring Walt and the other recipients, the _New York Times_ reported that President Johnson said the group’s achievements “have made freedom stronger for all [of] us.” A list of recipients ranged from Nobel Prize winning-author John Steinbeck; Hellen Keller, leader in assisting the blind and deaf; abstract impressionist painter Willem de Kooning, and Pulitzer Prize®-winning poet and biographer Carl Sandburg.

#### Seabees, US Naval Mobile Construction statuette, 1966

The day after Pearl Harbor was attacked in 1941, The Walt Disney Studio lots in Burbank were requisitioned by the US Army to house troops assigned to protect a nearby Lockheed aircraft plant. Walt—no longer young enough to enlist—was recruited by the government to create wartime-themed media. The Walt Disney Studios dedicated more than 90% of its wartime output to creating training, propaganda, and entertainment films, in addition to publicity campaigns and more than 1,200 military insignias. 

One of the insignias created was for the Seabees, which derived from “CB,” the initials of the Construction Battalion. The Seabees organization was created during World War II by civilian construction workers and, in 1966, honored Walt for his generosity and patriotism with an award featuring the Disney-designed insignia mascot.

#### President of the United States of America, The Walt Disney Commemorative Gold Medal, 1969

On March 25, 1969, Walt was honored posthumously with the Walt Disney Commemorative Medal at the White House in Washington, D.C. President Richard M. Nixon presented the medal to Walt’s wife, Lillian Disney. The President shared, “On behalf of the Congress of the United States, by reason of a joint resolution, and on behalf of all the people of the United States and, I think, of the world, a gold medal; a gold medal honoring Walt Disney for his service through so many years not only to the people of the United States, but to the people of the world." 

The gold medal was sculpted by prominent Walt Disney Imagineering sculptor Blaine Gibson and struck by the US Mint in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Congress authorized the US Mint to create 6,000 bronze replicas of the medal to sell as a fundraising effort to honor one of Walt’s last projects, the California Institute of the Arts. Now on display at Disneyland is the original gold medal presented to Lillian Disney. 

### Film Awards

It was presented to him for his outstanding contribution to the happiness of children throughout the world by the creation of Mickey Mouse and the Silly Symphony cartoons. In a letter to the editor of _Holiday_ magazine 20 years after receiving this honor, Walt recollected the memorable circumstances of its presentation: “My brother, Roy, and I were in London (this was 1935) prior to going to Paris to receive a medal from the League of Nations for Mickey Mouse. Under much protest, being strictly the sports clothes-type myself, we were persuaded to have morning suits made. We were told that any other attire would be inappropriate since it was to be an important occasion with ambassadors and other dignitaries in attendance. The fitting itself was a panic, with Roy's coat on me and mine on him, my pants on Roy and someone else's pants on me. The place was in a turmoil. Anyway, we went to the affair in Paris properly attired only to find that everyone there had wanted the boys from Hollywood to feel at home so they came in casual clothes! I haven't had the thing on since!"

On July 17, 1939, Walt wrote to the founder of the Venice Film Festival, Count Giuseppe Volpi di Misurata, thanking him for the award and praising its design: “The beauty and craftsmanship of this bronze trophy truly typifies the artistic abilities of the Italian people... Artistically, it surpasses anything we have in our collection of awards.” This special award was given a place of pride in Walt’s office at The Walt Disney Studios in Burbank.

Walt was honored with the second ever Cecil B. DeMille Award at the 1953 Golden Globe Awards. After receiving the award, Walt wrote to DeMille sharing, “I felt a deep sense of gratitude in receiving the DeMille Award... it was indeed an event that touched me.” [Walt Disney to Cecil B.

#### Gurdon Woods, San Francisco Museum of Art, Seed Award, 1958

In 1958, the San Francisco Museum of Art—known today as SFMOMA—presented Walt Disney with this bronze sculpture titled "Seed" in recognition of his "contribution to the arts of our time." If you are unsure what the award’s design is depicting, you are not alone, Walt did not know upon receiving it either. Disney animator Ken Anderson remembered Walt remarking the statuette looked like a burnt turkey on a pedestal with its legs sticking up in the air. The artist, Gordon Woods, was at the presentation of the award and came up to Walt. "It does look like a burnt turkey," he acknowledged. "What it is supposed to be is that your work and everything you do is like a seed you plant. That's supposed to be a seed sprouting." Walt replied, "I understand what this burnt turkey is now and will be proud to take it back with me to the Studio."
