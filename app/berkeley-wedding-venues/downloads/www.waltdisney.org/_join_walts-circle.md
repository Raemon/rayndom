# Walt's Circle Donor Program 

[Join as a New Donor](/old/tickets/mem)

### Our Imagination. Walt’s Legacy. Your Museum.

Generous gifts from Walt's Circle Donors help uphold Walt's legacy and expand our vision in deeper ways. Join as a Walt's Circle Donor and support the museum to welcome visitors from around the world, create one-of-a-kind [exhibitions](https://www.waltdisney.org/exhibitions), present engaging [programs](https://www.waltdisney.org/education/talks), offer innovative [educational activities](https://www.waltdisney.org/education/outreach), [classes](https://www.waltdisney.org/education/classes), and [workshops](https://www.waltdisney.org/education/workshops), and continue its unique mission.

Through special donor-level memberships—which are offered at three tiers, including Artist, Animator, and Director—Walt's Circle Donors enjoy exceptional rewards in recognition of the important role they play at The Walt Disney Family Museum. These memberships provide significant additional benefits on top of all of the benefits extended to members who give at the [Supporter level](https://www.waltdisney.org/join/membership), including first access to tickets for programs; exclusive invitations to donor receptions and other [special events](https://www.waltdisney.org/education/special-events); concierge-level assistance; and recognition in outlets such as the museum's member magazine, among other benefits. For more information about the three Walt's Circle Donor tiers and their corresponding membership benefits, see the listings below. 

We have improved our digital presence to stay true to our mission. Your membership ensures that we can continue opening our museum virtually to the world and that future generations can continue to be Inspired by Walt Disney's life and legacy. Join today to visit our [Member Portal](https://www.waltdisney.org/members) and receive exclusive access to select Happily Ever After Hours, Virtual Workshops and Storytimes, and more!

Please note that all memberships, including Walt’s Circle Donor memberships, are valid for one year from date of purchase and must be renewed annually if the member wishes to retain their benefits.
