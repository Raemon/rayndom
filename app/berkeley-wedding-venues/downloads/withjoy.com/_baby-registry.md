## Still have questions?

When should I start thinking about my baby registry?

Itâs never too early to start preparing for your babyâs arrival. Aim to begin your baby registry around six months before your due date. This timeframe allows you ample time to research and select the items youâll need. Starting early also gives you the flexibility to continue adding items as needed and coordinate events like baby showers.

What should I add to my baby registry?

Some essential categories to add to your baby registry include nursery, clothing, diapering, feeding, bathing and grooming, infant safety, gear and travel, health and wellness, and playtime and development. The specific items you'll need may vary depending on your lifestyle, preferences, and where you live, but example items include a crib, swaddling blankets, a changing pad, bottles, bibs and burp cloths, a baby bath or bath seat, baby monitor, stroller, car seat, toys, rattlers, and teethers.  
  
Remember to consider your lifestyle, home setup, and any specific needs or preferences when adding items to your baby registry. Joyâs cash funds are also a great way to earmark funds for something specific, whether youâll need to use it right away like in the case of a diaper fund or youâre saving for the future with a college fund.

Does Joy have a sample baby registry to start with?

We have several baby registry curations that you can start with. These curated lists are designed to provide you with great ideas and suggestions for the types of items you might want to include in your baby registry. They cover a variety of categories, from newborn must-haves to products you wonât want to leave the house without. Explore these curated lists to [jump-start your baby registry here]({{rootUrl}}/shop/baby/curations).

Is there a customer support team available for assistance?

Our awesome support squad has whipped up a fantastic collection of FAQs and nifty tips in our Help Center, all designed to make your baby registry journey easier. This treasure trove of information is here to give you lightning-fast and super-detailed answers, so you can get the most out of your baby registry. Let's make your baby prep a memorable adventure! [Visit our Help Center](https://help.withjoy.com/).

Should I create a baby registry for a second child?

Yes, creating a baby registry for your second child is a smart idea. While you might already have some baby gear from your first child, every baby is unique and might have different needs and preferences. A registry for your second child allows you to gather items that are tailored to this new baby's needs, and it gives your loved ones a chance to contribute in a meaningful way. Plus, friends and family are often eager to celebrate the arrival of each new addition to your family whether by hosting a sprinkle baby shower or sending a gift right to your home. So, go ahead and create that registry because every baby deserves their own special welcome party.

Does Joy cost anything to use?

Setting up your baby registry with Joy is completely free. We believe in helping you prepare for this exciting journey without any added costs. Plus, who needs extra expenses when you'll soon be an expert at spending on all things babyâfrom those adorable little outfits to, well, industrial-sized packs of diapers. But don't worry, the baby registry itself won't be digging into your diaper budget. Happy registering!

What should we include in our baby registry checklist?

A well-rounded baby registry ensures that youâre fully equipped to welcome your little one into the world. Hereâs a comprehensive checklist to guide you:   
  
Nursery: Your babyâs nursery is their sanctuary, so ensure itâs equipped with essentials like a crib, changing table, rocking chair or glider, dresser, crib mattress, crib bedding sets, and storage baskets or bins.   
  
Clothing: Babies grow quickly, so stock up on onesies, sleepers, swaddling blankets, sock, and booties, hats, and mittens in various sizes to keep them snug and stylish.   
  
Diapering: Keep your baby comfortable and dry with changing pads and covers, and a diaper bag for on-the-go changes.   
  
Feeding: Whether youâre breastfeeding or bottle-feeding, make sure you have bottles, a bottle brush, a breast pump (if breastfeeding), a nursing pillow, burp cloths, and bibs to make feeding time a breeze.   
  
Bathing and Grooming: Keep your little one squeaky clean with a baby bathtub, baby shampoo and body wash, hooded towels, baby nail clippers, and a soft-bristled brush or comb for gentle grooming.   
  
Infant Safety: Ensure your babyâs safety with essentials like a baby monitor, outlet covers, cabinet locks, corner guards, and baby gates to childproof your home.   
  
Gear and Travel: Stay mobile with must-haves such as a stroller, car seat, baby carrier or sling, portable crib or play yard, and a diaper changing pad for diaper changes on the go.   
  
Health and Wellness: Keep your baby healthy and happy with a baby thermometer, nasal aspirator, infant first aid kit, baby sunscreen, and baby lotion to protect their delicate skin.   
  
Playtime and Development: Stimulate your babyâs senses and encourage development with toys like rattles, teethers, plush toys, a play mat or activity gym, board books, stuffed animals, and musical toys for endless fun and learning.
