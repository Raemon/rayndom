###  [What Is a Baby Sprinkle? + Tips for Hosting](https://withjoy.com/baby-guides/baby-sprinkle/ "What Is a Baby Sprinkle? + Tips for Hosting")

A baby sprinkle is a less formal version of a baby shower, commonly thrown for or by parents having a second or third child. If you already have most of the gear you’ll need for your new baby, a sprinkle might be ideal because it includes fewer gifts than a baby shower would.

_4.6K_

During your first pregnancy, you probably celebrated with a baby shower. But when baby number two — or three, four, or more — comes around, they deserve a party, too. That’s where a baby sprinkle comes in, serving as an informal second baby shower.

You most likely already own most of the big items your new baby might need, as well as potential hand-me-downs from your firstborn. A sprinkle offers the perfect opportunity to [register for gifts](https://withjoy.com/baby-registry/) of daily essentials your new baby will need, like diapers and wipes.

No matter what type of party you’re planning, whether it be a [wedding shower](https://withjoy.com/blog/wedding-showers-everything-you-need-to-know/), a traditional baby shower, or a sprinkle, the goal is to create a joyful occasion to celebrate the honorees. Use the tips below to throw a memorable sprinkle for your favorite expectant parents.

## **Sprinkle Etiquette**

![A woman opens gift at baby sprinkle while a smiling woman watches](https://withjoy.com/baby-guides/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/sprinkle-etiquette-1.png)

Baby sprinkle etiquette is usually more relaxed and casual compared to traditional baby showers. These are intimate gatherings, often hosted by a close friend or sibling or the parents-to-be themselves, with the aim of celebrating a new life and offering support and encouragement to the expectant parents.

Unlike baby showers, baby sprinkles do not focus on big-ticket gifts. For a sprinkle, you can register for smaller gifts and essentials such as diapers, [bottles](https://www.withjoy.com/baby-guides/best-baby-bottles/), and bibs. 

Some expecting parents opt to have multiple baby sprinkles so they can celebrate with different groups of friends or family. The main goal is to surround the honorees with a warm, supportive environment.

### **Who hosts a sprinkle?**

A baby sprinkle is often hosted by the parents-to-be or a close friend or family member. In general, the hosting duties for a sprinkle are more flexible than a traditional baby shower.

Unlike a traditional shower, the parents-to-be are usually more involved in the planning of a sprinkle. This may involve deciding on a theme, determining the guest list, and other specifics. But similar to a traditional shower, the host is responsible for preparing and sending out invitations about four to six weeks before the party, including registry information where applicable. 

The host should also handle greeting the guests, coordinating games, announcing when to eat, and taking care of the post-party clean-up.

### **When to throw a sprinkle**

A baby sprinkle is typically held in the second or early to mid-third trimester of pregnancy because it allows plenty of time before the baby’s arrival. But there are no hard-and-fast rules, and the timing can be adjusted based on the convenience of the expectant parents and the guests. 

Just like planning when to have a baby shower, it’s essential to consider factors like the time of day, venue, guests’ schedules, and the expecting parents’ preference when planning a baby sprinkle. Schedules may also dictate whether you have an in-person sprinkle or a virtual one with your guests attending via video calls.

## **How to Throw a Baby Sprinkle**

While it won’t be as involved as a baby shower, throwing a baby sprinkle still requires a bit of planning. Here are some basics you’ll need to know.

![5 steps to plan a baby sprinkle](https://withjoy.com/baby-guides/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/steps-to-plan-a-baby-sprinkle.png)![5 steps to plan a baby sprinkle](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201560%201884%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

### **Creating the guest list**

Since a baby sprinkle is a more casual gathering than a baby shower, the guest list should be smaller. Consider these tips when deciding who to invite:

  * **Keep it intimate:** Consider inviting only close family and friends.
  * **Consider the parents-to-be:** Always consult the parents-to-be while making the guest list. 
  * **Mind the venue:** The size of your venue will also dictate the number of guests you can accommodate. 
  * **Involve siblings:** If there are older siblings, consider inviting their close friends or playmates to make them feel part of the celebration.
  * **Consider out-of-town guests:** If key family members and friends live far away, you might want to coordinate dates with them or arrange their virtual participation.



### **Picking a theme**

![Baby sprinkle table with rainbow cake and balloons in background](https://withjoy.com/baby-guides/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/picking-a-theme-1.png)![Baby sprinkle table with rainbow cake and balloons in background](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201561%201040%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Keeping in mind that a baby sprinkle is a toned-down version of a baby shower, the theme should be simple and not overly elaborate. But picking a baby sprinkle theme can still be a fun and creative process. Here are some tips:

  * **Incorporate the Parents’ Preferences:** Look to the favorites of the parents-to-be, such as colors, hobbies, and interests, as inspiration.
  * **Seasonal Theme:** If the sprinkle is around a particular season or holiday, consider a theme highlighting it. Spring could inspire a floral theme, while winter might inspire a polar bear or snowman theme.
  * **Nursery Theme:** If the baby’s nursery theme or color scheme has already been decided by the parents, consider using the sprinkle to highlight their choice.
  * **Neutral Themes:** If you want to keep the party [gender-neutral](https://withjoy.com/baby-guides/gender-neutral-nursery-ideas/), consider a general theme like rainbows, baby animals, or books



### **How long should it last?**

A typical baby sprinkle lasts around two to three hours. This provides plenty of time for guests to mingle, eat, enjoy any shower games, and for the honorees to open their presents. The party’s exact length will naturally vary based on the preferences of the host and the parents-to-be.

### **Should there be games?**

Incorporating games at a baby sprinkle can be a great way to entertain guests and make the event more engaging. The games should be less complex and time-consuming compared to those at a traditional baby shower, given the more casual nature of a sprinkle. Consider games that are easy to participate in and enjoyable for all guests, such as guessing games or ones involving baby pictures of the attendees.

## **Creating the Perfect Second Baby Registry**

![Male couple with toddler looking at laptop](https://withjoy.com/baby-guides/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/second-baby-registry-1.png)![Male couple with toddler looking at laptop](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201561%201040%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

When the time comes to [create the gift registry](https://withjoy.com/baby-guides/baby-registry-checklist) for your second baby, it will look a bit different from your first. You most likely have the essentials already, so you’ll want to keep these tips in mind as you build your registry:

**1\. Inventory what you already have.**

Take stock of what you already own from your first baby. This includes clothes, toys, furniture, and other equipment that still functions well.

**2\. Consider the gap between your children.**

If there’s a significant age gap between your children, you may need to replace certain items that have worn out, or if trends and safety standards have changed.

**3\. Think about the baby’s sex.**

If your second baby is a different sex than your first, you may want to register for clothes and other sex-specific items.

**4\. Register for consumables.**

Even if you have most of the larger items, you’ll still need more consumable [essentials such as diapers](https://withjoy.com/baby-guides/how-many-newborn-diapers-do-i-need/), pacifiers, and baby care products. 

**5\. Prepare for multiples.**

If you’re expecting twins or more, you’ll likely need duplicates of many items. Make sure to register for enough to cover all your babies.

**6\. Include a small number of big-ticket items, if needed.**

If there’s a pricey item you didn’t receive the first time around, like a high-quality stroller or a modern crib, don’t hesitate to include it. Some guests might group together to purchase larger items.

Remember, the key to a solid second baby registry is to focus on what you truly need rather than stocking up on unnecessary items.

Growing your family with another child deserves to be celebrated. Gather your loved ones together for the perfect baby sprinkle as a reminder of the support system surrounding you and your family.
