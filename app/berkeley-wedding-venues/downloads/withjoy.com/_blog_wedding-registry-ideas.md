With the wedding planning process in full swing, now you’re ready for the fun part: [curating your registry](https://withjoy.com/blog/reasons-to-create-wedding-registry/)! Since the number of wedding registry items can feel overwhelming, we’ve done the heavy lifting for you. But before you scroll through our picks for the best wedding registry ideas, here are a few useful ideas to keep in mind: 

### **Helpful Tips to Get Started:**

  * **Consider what you need:** Use this list as a starting point — only add items that make sense for your lifestyle and needs.


  * **Start early:** Give yourself [plenty of time](https://withjoy.com/blog/when-to-create-your-wedding-registry/) to select your favorite wedding registry items and make changes if needed. 


  * **Work with your partner:** Your wedding registry items are for both of you to enjoy. Plus, it can be a fun bonding experience!


  * **Consider registering for more than physical gifts:** Joy’s [all-in-one registry](https://withjoy.com/blog/what-type-of-wedding-registry-is-right-for-you/) allows guests to give you a gift card or contribute to your honeymoon.


  * **Use a**[**wedding registry checklist**](https://withjoy.com/blog/wedding-registry-checklist/)**:** This will help narrow down your “musts” and “maybes” and ensure you don’t forget anything important.


  * **Register for products in multiple price points:** This way, wedding guests can choose an item they’re enthusiastic about within a comfortable price range.


  * **Register for more gifts than you have guests:** There’s no “right” answer, but a good [rule of thumb](https://withjoy.com/blog/wedding-registry-guilt/) is to multiply your guest list by two to get a rough number.
