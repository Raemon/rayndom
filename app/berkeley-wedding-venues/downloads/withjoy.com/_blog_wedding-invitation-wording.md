While most couples might consider wedding invitation wording a minor detail, it’s actually an important part of your wedding planning. What you write on your invitations gives guests all the essential details they need to know about your wedding day. Your approach and choice of traditional or modern wording can help set the tone for your event. 

But getting the language right on your invitation might be easier said than done. The task becomes infinitely more complicated when you pair unfamiliar rules of etiquette with unconventional family dynamics and sticky situations. To help you get it right, here’s a comprehensive guide to help you navigate wedding invitation wording.

## **The Anatomy of a Wedding Invitation**

The best wedding invitation wording is short and sweet. While the choice of designs and fonts will vary from couple to couple, details like the couple’s names, date, time and location are pretty standard. Every wedding invitation should include the following elements. 

![A wedding invitation with watercolor edges surrounded by sunglasses, wedding rings, and a seashell](https://withjoy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Wedding-Invitation-Wording_Anatomy-1024x683.jpg)![A wedding invitation with watercolor edges surrounded by sunglasses, wedding rings, and a seashell](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201024%20683%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

### **The Host of the Wedding**

Wedding invitation etiquette says the first line is reserved for the host — essentially, whoever is footing the bill. Traditionally, this was the bride’s parents, but times have changed. Today, it’s not uncommon for couples to pay for a wedding themselves, share the expense with their parents, or for both families to split the bill. Moreover, some couples may choose to honor both sets of parents, regardless of who’s paying. Others may include divorced parents or even those who have passed away.

Ultimately, the choice is entirely up to you. Go with what feels right — you can certainly list as many names as you like. But just keep in mind that the more complex your family dynamics are, the more creative you need to be with the wording. 

If you want to simplify your wedding invitation wording, you can always go with broad strokes like: 

  *  _“Together with their parents”_
  *  _“Together with their families”_



**Notes on Form**  
---  
The word “and” in between two names typically denotes that those people are to be married.  
  
Divorced parents’ names should be listed on separate lines.   
  
Stepparents should be listed on the same line as their partner.   
  
Deceased parent(s) could be recognized as follows: _“Lily Ferraro, daughter of Mr. Victor Ferraro and the late Isabel Ferraro.”_  
  
### **The Request**

While wedding invitations are fairly intuitive, they should still include a formal request for attendance. This is pretty straightforward, but the words you choose for your request can help set the tone for your wedding. And there’s no mystery here: If your wedding is more formal, use formal language. If you’d like your wedding to have a more casual vibe, use casual language. 

Requests for attendance with a more formal tone may look like: 

  *  _“the pleasure of your company”_
  *  _“at the marriage of their children”_
  *  _“the honor of your presence”_



Requests for attendance with a more casual tone may look like: 

  *  _“would love for you to join them”_
  *  _“invite you to celebrate with them”_

**Notes on Form**  
---  
The phrase “The honor of your presence” is traditionally used to denote a religious service.  
  
Some stationers may suggest using the British spelling, “honour of your presence,” to indicate a ceremony in a church or house of worship. Either way is perfectly acceptable.   
  
### **Names of the Couple**

The couple’s names should appear prominently on a wedding invitation, whether you are hosting or not. In most cases, your names are printed in a larger font than the rest of the text.

****N** otes on Form**  
---  
Traditionally, the bride’s name appears first (if someone in the couple identifies as such).  
  
Invitations from the bride’s parents typically refer to their daughter by her first and middle names. The groom is referred to by his full name.   
  
For same-sex couples, names can be listed alphabetically or in any order you like.   
  
For a more casual wedding, some couples opt to use first names only.  
  
### **Date and Time**

The date and time listed on your wedding invitation might seem like another important but benign detail. Your choice of numerals or words, however, will speak volumes about the tone of your wedding. 

For a more formal event, the wedding date and time are spelled out. For example, a ceremony scheduled for November 8, 2024, at 5:30 p.m., should read “Saturday, the eighth of November, two thousand twenty-four, at half after five in the afternoon.” For a more casual feel, couples can opt for numerals instead. 

****N** otes on Form**  
---  
The day of the week and the month are capitalized.   
  
The year is all lowercase, and there is no “and” when spelling out the year.  
  
For formal invitations, the time of day should be spelled out as “five o’clock” or “half after five o’clock.” Less formal invitations can use “half past five o’clock” or “five-thirty.”  
  
Typically, wedding invitations skip phrases like “in the afternoon” or “in the evening” unless the hour of your wedding ceremony may cause confusion (8 a.m. or 9 a.m.). These phrases are usually reserved for clarity, but some wedding invitation designers may use them as line fillers or to improve the look of your invitation.   
  
Modern and informal wedding invitation designs may use numerals to list the date and time.   
  
Whether you choose formal wording or informal numerals, it’s important to be consistent across all wedding stationery and match the overall tone of your event.   
  
### **Ceremony Venue**

This part of your wedding invitation wording is fairly straightforward. The ceremony venue is usually listed as follows: 

  *  _“Venue Name” (on one line)_
  * _“City, State” (on the following line)_

****N** otes on Form**  
---  
For formal weddings, the state name is usually spelled out (abbreviations are a no-no).  
  
The street address of the [wedding venue](https://withjoy.com/blog/affordable-wedding-venues-baltimore/) is typically not included.  
  
### **Reception Information**

The [wedding reception](https://withjoy.com/blog/wedding-reception-ideas/) details are usually listed on the last line of the invitation. This line can be tricky because you need to give your guests a lot of information in as few words as possible. The wording you choose will ultimately tell your guests where the reception will take place, what food and beverage offerings to expect, and the tone of the reception. 

Here’s the catch: You typically have one line to convey all those details. If you need more space to be specific, you can also opt for a reception card as part of your invitation suite. 

****N** otes on Form**  
---  
If the reception will be at the same location as the wedding ceremony, you can keep it simple with _“Please join us for an evening of dinner and dancing following”_ for a formal celebration or _“Drinks, dancing and merriment to follow”_ for a casual wedding.  
  
If the wedding reception is at a different location, you can reflect that as _“Reception to follow at [name of venue].”_  
  
You can print the full address of your wedding reception venue on a separate reception card included in your invitation suite.   
  
If you’re not planning a full meal, you can indicate that with something like _“Join us after the ceremony for cocktails, hors d’oeuvres and dancing.”_  
  
### **Dress Code**

Information regarding the dress code for your wedding is optional, with one exception. If your wedding is a black-tie affair, you must indicate that on the invitation. 

You should also keep in mind that without any direction, your guest will be left to their own devices. Some may make inferences about your event’s formality based on the invitation’s tone and look — while others may not. Dress code instructions are great to include on your [wedding website FAQ page](https://withjoy.com/blog/23-questions-wedding-website-faq/). 

## **What to Leave Out of Your Wedding Invitation Wording**

![A wedding invitation with two rings laid on top of it, surrounded by flowers, a pair of heels and slightly lit up from the glow of sunlight](https://withjoy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Wedding-Invitation-Wording__What-Not-to-Do-1024x683.jpg)![A wedding invitation with two rings laid on top of it, surrounded by flowers, a pair of heels and slightly lit up from the glow of sunlight](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201024%20683%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

The purpose of your wedding invitation is to give your guests all the information they need for your event. But too much information on one card is information overload, and from a visual perspective, it just doesn’t look good. Use your invitation suite to share additional details for any information beyond the time, date and location. Separate inserts are a great idea for the following details. 

  * **Wedding website:** Your [wedding website](https://withjoy.com/blog/wedding-website-more-important-than-ever/) can be a trove of information about your big day, but a clunky URL can clutter an elegant invitation. If you’re keen on including it, consider a URL shortener or adding the wedding website in smaller print.  

  * **Registry information:** Your invitation isn’t a wish list, so skip any mention of gifts or your [wedding registry](https://withjoy.com/blog/wedding-registry-checklist/). The best place to share this info is on your wedding website or by word of mouth.  

  * **RSVP info:** Oftentimes, guests will have questions about bringing plus-ones and kids. While you’ll want to answer those questions for everyone, the face of your invitation isn’t the place to do it. Feel free to address these concerns on a separate RSVP card or an insert directing guests to your wedding website FAQ page. 



## **Traditional Versus Modern Wedding Invitation Wording**

![Joy's Garden Wedding invitation on a piece of cloth surrounded by a wedding ring in a velvet box, a matching envelope, and matching wedding website on a tablet featuring aa couple embracing](https://withjoy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Wedding-Invitation-Wording_Garden-Window-Theme-3-1024x798.jpg)![Joy's Garden Wedding invitation on a piece of cloth surrounded by a wedding ring in a velvet box, a matching envelope, and matching wedding website on a tablet featuring aa couple embracing](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201024%20798%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

While some first marriages and weddings hosted by parents tend to lean more traditional, some celebrations call for a more modern approach to wedding invitation wording. Just a few examples: those entering a second marriage, non-hetero couples, couples hosting their own wedding, or those choosing a destination wedding. 

Modern wedding invitation wording can still be formal or casual but allows for more personalization and a chance for your unique voices to shine through. If requesting the honor of your guests’ presence isn’t quite your vibe, feel free to take the modern approach and make your wedding invitation wording your own. 

## **Wedding Invitation Wording Examples**
