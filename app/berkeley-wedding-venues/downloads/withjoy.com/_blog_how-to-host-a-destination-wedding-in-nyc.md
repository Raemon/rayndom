  * Providing information on various accommodation options, from budget-friendly to luxury.
  * Arranging for shuttle services or recommending transportation options.



By taking care of your guests’ needs, you ensure they feel welcome and supported throughout your wedding celebration.

## Transportation Options for Your Wedding

Ensuring your guests can navigate NYC with ease is crucial for a stress-free wedding experience. New York City, known for its bustling streets and iconic landmarks, is a popular destination for weddings, offering numerous transportation options for you and your guests.

### Shuttle Services vs. Public Transport

When deciding on transportation for your wedding guests, consider the pros and cons of shuttle services versus public transport.

For the wedding couple, arranging VIP transportation can add a touch of luxury to your special day. Options include luxury car services, limousines, or even vintage cars. When choosing VIP transportation, consider the style and theme of your wedding, as well as the comfort and convenience of your guests.

By carefully planning your transportation options, you can ensure that your wedding day in NYC is as memorable and stress-free as possible. Whether you opt for shuttle services, public transport, or VIP transportation, the right choice will depend on your specific needs and preferences.

## Planning Activities for Guests

Your NYC destination wedding is not just about the ceremony; it’s also about creating memorable experiences for your guests. With a city as vibrant as New York, there are countless ways to entertain and engage your loved ones before and after the big day.

### City Tours and Sightseeing Recommendations

Wine Tasting| Local Vineyards| $75-$150 per person  
Escape Room Challenge| Multiple Locations| $30-$50 per person  
  
### Dining Options for Post-Wedding Gatherings

From celebrity-chef owned eateries to cozy, family-run trattorias, the city offers a diverse culinary landscape. Some top recommendations include **Carbone** for Italian-American cuisine, _L’Artusi_ for French-Italian fusion, or **The NoMad** for upscale dining.

By incorporating these activities into your wedding itinerary, you’ll ensure that your guests have a truly unforgettable experience in the city that never sleeps.
