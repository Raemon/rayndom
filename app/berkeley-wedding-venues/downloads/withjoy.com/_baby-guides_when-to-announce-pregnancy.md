Medical professionals generally advise parents-to-be to wait until **the end of the first trimester** before announcing a pregnancy, since it marks the point when the potential for a miscarriage steeply declines.

Positive test result? Oh boy! Now there’s a baby on the way and it’s time to spread the news. Figuring out the exact timing for letting people know can be confusing. It’s important to remember that there’s no wrong answer because it’s a very personal choice based on what’s right for _you_. 

Whether it’s your first pregnancy or you’re on baby number four, deciding when to announce is a choice you will have to make multiple times as you tell the various people in your life. Let’s take a look at how some people decide to handle it. 

## **When Is It Safe to Announce Your Pregnancy?**

The decision will always be a personal choice, and the exact timing usually depends on various factors. Many parents-to-be choose to wait until **after the first trimester — approximately 12 weeks.** Statistics reveal that [10%-25% of pregnancies](https://americanpregnancy.org/getting-pregnant/pregnancy-loss/signs-of-miscarriage/) may end in a miscarriage, though the risk drops drastically after this time. As Dr. Kim Langdon, an OB-GYN with [Medzino](https://www.medzino.com/us/kimberly-langdon/), recommends, “Wait until 10-12 weeks of pregnancy after an ultrasound confirms a heartbeat.”

![Hands holding sonogram and quote from Dr Kim Langdon to wait until 10-12 weeks to announce pregnancy](https://withjoy.com/baby-guides/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/when-is-it-safe-to-announce-your-pregnancy.png)

Additionally, by the 12th week, parents have typically done ultrasounds to see the baby and possibly even genetic tests for conditions like Down syndrome, providing further reassurance of the baby’s general health and safety. Regardless of the exact timing you choose, it is important for you to feel comfortable and ready to share the news.

### **When do you start showing in pregnancy?**

For first-time moms, **your baby bump might not show until about 12 to 16 weeks**. It’s common for people in their first pregnancy to not show until well into their second trimester. If it’s your second or third baby, you may show earlier because your body has already experienced the changes of pregnancy at least once before.

When you start to notice your own baby bump depends on a few factors, such as:

  * Your personal body type
  * Your weight prior to your pregnancy
  * Whether this is your first pregnancy or not 



Women who were fairly thin before pregnancy may visibly show signs of their pregnancy earlier.

### **When is it best to announce on social media?**

Deciding when to announce the news on social media mostly depends on your own comfort level. Most people continue to follow the end of the first-trimester timing to wait out the higher risk of miscarriage, but each parent-to-be is different.

Some choose to announce as soon as they find out, while others may wait until they are further along or even until after the baby is born. Keep in mind that the online community you’re making the announcement to may include your boss, work colleagues, distant relatives, friends, and acquaintances.   
Announcing your pregnancy on social media may also be a good time to share a [link to your baby registry](https://withjoy.com/baby-registry/) for those who want to [celebrate your news with a gift](https://withjoy.com/baby-guides/push-present/). Ultimately, each person’s journey is unique and the timing of your announcement should reflect what feels right for you.

## **Pregnancy Milestones to Consider**

Pregnancy is marked by a series of significant milestones in growth and development. Some of them are invisible to the naked eye and others provide visible clues of your growing baby’s progress. You may opt to determine the right time to announce your pregnancy based on one or more of these milestones.

![chronological list of markers of. your baby's prenatal growth](https://withjoy.com/baby-guides/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/markers-of-your-babys-prenatal-growth.png)![chronological list of markers of. your baby's prenatal growth](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20780%201453%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

In the first trimester, milestones include:

  * **3 weeks:** fertilization of the egg 
  * **4 weeks:** implantation and organ development
  * **5 weeks:** start of the baby’s heartbeat
  * **6 weeks:** formation of facial features



The second trimester brings milestones such as:

  * **12 weeks:** risk of miscarriage [drops drastically to about 5%](https://www.marchofdimes.org/find-support/topics/miscarriage-loss-grief/miscarriage)
  * **14-16 weeks:** a doctor’s identification of the baby’s sex
  * **Approximately 18 weeks:** the first feelings of the baby moving
  * **20 weeks:** the halfway point of an average pregnancy



Of course, these medical milestones are general guides and can vary widely among pregnant individuals. Some people prefer to wait until after the first prenatal appointment in order to receive confirmation from their health care provider. Such appointments often occur around week eight of a pregnancy. 

Or you may prefer focusing on the more tangible milestones like:

  * First ultrasound
  * First anatomy scan
  * When your baby bump starts to show
  * First 3D or 4D ultrasound



## **When to Tell Your Loved Ones**

![Adult daughter with arm around her mother looking at cell phone in hand](https://withjoy.com/baby-guides/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/when-to-tell-your-loved-ones.png)![Adult daughter with arm around her mother looking at cell phone in hand](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20781%20520%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Deciding when to tell your loved ones is a deeply personal decision, and the timing may differ based on exactly who you’re telling. The “right” time to announce a pregnancy will depend on your individual circumstances and preferences. You might decide to share the news earlier with certain family members or friends to get their emotional support or advice.

### **Your partner**

If you have a partner, telling them about your pregnancy creates a memorable moment for you both. Relationship dynamics, your own emotional readiness, and finding the timing that feels right to you can all play a part in how you announce your pregnancy to your partner. 

Some people may choose to tell their partner immediately after discovering the pregnancy, while others might wait until they have a medically confirmed pregnancy test or even after the first prenatal visit. There’s no hard-and-fast rule when it comes to sharing this news, so you should find a moment that feels right to you.

### **Your parents**

Making the decision about when to tell your parents often depends on your relationship with them and their expected reactions. Some parents-to-be opt to tell their own parents immediately, as they begin to build a supportive community to help them on their pregnancy journey. 

Others prefer to wait until they have received confirmation from a doctor or other health care provider. For high-risk parents-to-be, waiting until the 12th week may feel safer. As with anyone you choose to tell about your pregnancy, the timing should reflect what feels appropriate for you and your partner.

### **Your kids**

Figuring out the best time to tell your children about your pregnancy will depend on their age, level of understanding, and your pregnancy progress. Most experts recommend waiting until after the first trimester, given that the pregnancy is more stable by that point.

  * For **toddlers ages 1-3** , it’s generally a good idea to introduce the concept of pregnancy when you start visibly showing, typically during the second or third trimester.
  * With **preschoolers ages 3-5** , aim to share the news around the middle of the second trimester, using simple explanations and children’s books about baby development and being a big sibling.
  * For **school-aged children ages 6-12** , start the conversation at the beginning of the second trimester, or earlier if they notice physical or behavioral changes and ask questions. The use of tangible visuals like ultrasound pictures or a gift from the new baby can help build a sibling’s excitement.



## **When to Inform Your Work**

![Pregnant woman sitting at desk with laptop and her hand on belly ](https://withjoy.com/baby-guides/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/when-to-inform-your-work.png)![Pregnant woman sitting at desk with laptop and her hand on belly ](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20781%20521%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

There are a few things worth considering when deciding to let your boss, human resources, and colleagues know about your pregnancy. They include:

  * **The type of work you do:** If your job involves physical labor or exposure to potentially harmful substances, it’s recommended that you inform your employer early for your safety and the baby’s.


  * **Where you are in your pregnancy:** Some choose to wait until after the first trimester once the risk of miscarriage has significantly decreased.
  * **Understanding your legal protections:** Familiarize yourself with both your local laws and your company’s policies about maternity leave and job protection.
  * **Your feelings toward your coworkers:** Consider your comfort level with sharing your personal news at work.



Remember that it’s illegal for an employer to [fire you because you’re pregnant](https://www.eeoc.gov/pregnancy-discrimination). In fact, they are required to provide a reasonable accommodation to any limitations related to your pregnancy, childbirth, or medical conditions that could develop as a result of your pregnancy.

Consider what’s important to you and your partner when determining who to tell and when. Although there could be a bit of stress in figuring out when to tell the people in your life, remember that this is the first step in building a supportive community for you and your new baby. 

## Frequently Asked Questions

#### **Why do some people wait to announce a pregnancy?**

There are numerous reasons why some people choose to wait to announce a pregnancy. One of the biggest reasons is concern about the higher risk of miscarriage during the first trimester. Many parents-to-be, especially those who’ve been through the challenging process of [in vitro fertilization (IVF)](https://www.withjoy.com/baby-guides/ivf-pregnancy-announcement/), fear the heartbreaking task of informing their loved ones if a miscarriage occurs, so they opt to wait until that is much less likely to happen.

Some parents prefer to confirm the baby’s health with the first prenatal checkup before sharing the news widely. This typically occurs around week eight of the pregnancy. Waiting also allows for the availability of prenatal testing later in pregnancy, which can provide further reassurance about the baby’s health.

There are also workplace considerations. Announcing your pregnancy early at work may be necessary if there are safety implications or if advanced planning is needed for your maternity leave. However, some people wait to announce at work due to possible impacts on their employment and potential discrimination.

#### **When should I announce my second pregnancy?**

The decision on when to announce your second pregnancy is very similar to your first pregnancy. Many people still choose to wait until after the first trimester, around the 12-week mark. 

Second pregnancies often develop a baby bump quicker than first-time pregnancies, so keep that in mind when figuring out the best time for you and your family to tell others. When announcing any pregnancy, the timing of the announcement should depend on your comfort level, emotional readiness, and personal circumstances. Remember that the birth of a second (or third or fourth) child deserves to be celebrated — hello, [baby sprinkle](https://withjoy.com/baby-guides/baby-sprinkle/)! — just as much as first-born kids do.

#### **What is the best time for announcing the adoption of a baby?**

[Announcing the adoption of a baby](https://withjoy.com/baby-guides/adoption-announcement/) is another highly personal decision, and there’s no universal “best time.” Many adoptive parents choose to wait until they receive “the call” revealing that the baby’s arrival is imminent. This is because the adoption process can be unpredictable and filled with delays and uncertainties. 

Some families might also prefer to wait until the adoption is legally finalized to avoid any potential disappointments during the adoption process. Ultimately, the best time to announce an adoption is when the adoptive parents feel confident and comfortable sharing their news.

#### **How should I tell people I miscarried after announcing my pregnancy?**

Sharing about a miscarriage can be a difficult and emotional task, especially after you’ve already announced your pregnancy. A compassionate and straightforward approach is often best. 

Here’s one suggested message you can share with the people you want to know:

“Dear loved ones, we wanted to share some heartbreaking news with you. Unfortunately, we’ve experienced a miscarriage. This has been a tough time for us, and we’re trying to navigate through our grief. 

We appreciate all the love and support you gave us when we announced our pregnancy, and we hope you’ll continue to stand by us during this challenging time. Please respect our space to heal and process this loss. 

Thank you for your understanding and kindness.”

Don’t forget, it’s OK to ask for emotional support and to take the necessary time to grieve.
