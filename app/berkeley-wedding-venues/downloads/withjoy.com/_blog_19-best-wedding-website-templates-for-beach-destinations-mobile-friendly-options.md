The platform’s dedicated wedding app syncs smoothly with your website and optimizes the guest experience on all devices. This mobile-first approach is a great way to get the most from destination weddings where guests are always moving.

Minted’s Ocean Breeze template stands out as one of the best [destination wedding websites](https://withjoy.com/blog/tag/destination-wedding/?srsltid=AfmBOoo4_84X53Iprteh1NCX1ECI0Aiq_VciFcKKAZ2hIO_NOD8E44Ta). The template has design elements that work perfectly for oceanfront celebrations. Our Joy platform has many templates, but this one brings a fresh take for couples who want an artistic yet practical wedding website.

The Ocean Breeze template shows off a design-focused approach with modern esthetics that capture coastal vibes perfectly. Independent artists create the ocean-inspired elements, which gives your wedding website a unique look. The template is a match for other designs and lets you create perfect visual harmony between your digital presence and physical stationery.

### Minted – Ocean Breeze RSVP and guest tools

Ocean Breeze’s RSVP system goes beyond simple templates with detailed guest management features. The platform has a user-friendly [guest list](https://withjoy.com/guest-list/) import tool that makes managing your attendees much easier. This RSVP system really shines especially when you have destination weddings where tracking responses matters most for planning.

## [Joy – Nautical Nights](https://withjoy.com/designs/?srsltid=AfmBOooPDBv3G_SdV9i64sdSty4NYQSTscIPRg1-GifJ23EzlnHah_ze)

Our Joy – Nautical Nights template captures the magical atmosphere of the sea after sunset. Couples will love its sophisticated maritime elements. The template stands out as an excellent choice for the best [wedding website](https://withjoy.com/wedding-website) to plan destination weddings with evening beach ceremonies or yacht club receptions.

### Joy – Nautical Nights design features

A striking deep navy blue background sets the mood by reflecting the ocean’s peaceful mystery after dark. The design uses elegant white accents and minimalist elements that create a sophisticated contrast against the rich backdrop. Stylish nautical motifs shine through with subtle anchor icons and classic sailboat sketches. These elements create an upscale maritime atmosphere without looking kitschy. The template’s refined gold accents add luxury and blend well with clean typography that guides your guests through the wedding details.

### Joy – Nautical Nights mobile experience

The Nautical Nights template puts accessibility first with a fully integrated mobile experience through our companion app. Your guests can access all wedding information as they travel to your destination. The free app lets attendees view your schedule, accommodations, and other critical details on-the-go instead of struggling with pinching and zooming on regular websites. Guests receive instant updates about itinerary changes through push notifications. The app combines smoothly with transportation options—guests can pull up Google Maps driving directions and book rides through Uber or Lyft right from the user-friendly interface.

### Joy – Nautical Nights guest interaction tools

## [Zola – Oahu](https://www.zola.com/)

Zola’s Oahu template stands out as a refined choice compared to Joy beach templates. This exclusive design brings a classic yet unique approach to wedding websites with a coastal theme.

### Zola – Oahu design features

The Oahu template uses a black and white color scheme that sets it apart from typical blue and brown beach designs. Hand-painted seashells, starfish, and flowers adorn the pages and create an elegant seaside feel without going overboard. Botanical illustrator Maggie Enterrios (@littlepatterns) created this exclusive design as her first wedding paper project. Her detailed and playful patterns, which you might recognize from product packaging worldwide, add an artistic touch to this template. The design strikes a sweet spot between playful and elegant, which makes it quite different from our [Joy templates](https://withjoy.com/designs/) that tend to use brighter ocean-inspired colors.

### Zola – Oahu mobile experience

The mobile version of Oahu comes with a few issues you should know about. Users have found that the template looks great on desktop but behaves differently on mobile devices. Some users report that the mobile site shows up with a black background and basic text, missing many of the design elements they see on desktop. The mobile version also seems to have trouble with typography – the “nice font” doesn’t show up the same way on all devices. All the same, Zola’s platform works smoothly with [wedding planning tools](https://withjoy.com/wedding-website) like guest lists and RSVPs.

### Zola – Oahu best for beach weddings

This template shines brightest for stylish couples who plan seaside weddings or summer celebrations. Its sophisticated black and white approach fits perfectly for beach weddings where couples want ocean themes without bright colors taking over. The template ended up being a clear signal to guests that they can expect “a lot of sun and sand” while keeping things classy. Though it differs from our Joy templates, Oahu really delivers for couples who want a more understated yet elegant wedding website. The design balances beach elements with sophisticated styling, making it a great fit for formal oceanfront ceremonies that still want to keep that beachy feel.

## [Appy Couple – Island Vibes](https://www.appycouple.com/)

Beach weddings in tropical locations need great planning tools. The Appy Couple – Island Vibes template really shines among other [destination wedding](https://withjoy.com/blog/destination-wedding-cost/) websites. This template blends beautiful tropical esthetics with practical features that make beach wedding planning a breeze.

### Appy Couple – Island Vibes design features

The Island Vibes template has a stylish design that anyone can personalize. Your guests will love the full-screen cover pages with videos and slideshows that create stunning first impressions. We designed the template with flexible sections that let you customize titles, control visibility, and arrange content just the way you want. While Joy templates offer good customization options too, Island Vibes stands out with its combined app-website experience that works smoothly on all platforms. You’ll find multiple layout options to showcase your beach destination details in style.

### Appy Couple – Island Vibes guest list segmentation

The guest management system here is a step above Joy’s offering with better segmentation features. You can build your guest list in several ways – upload spreadsheets, add guests manually, or let them sign up using your wedding code. The platform makes it easy to create family groups for couples and families. You can set different privacy levels for each event, so guests only see what they’re invited to. The system handles plus-ones beautifully, either through general settings or individual guest additions.

### Appy Couple – Island Vibes travel concierge

The [travel concierge feature](https://withjoy.com/blog/hotel-block-for-wedding/?srsltid=AfmBOoovrpkVylKCjYdsd5NO0udnwhi-nNDRGjkvsRDMDUCyf8AKu_rA) makes Island Vibes the top choice for destination wedding planning. Your guests get access to:

  * Local hotels with possible room block discounts
  * Transportation services with Uber discounts

You can create dedicated travel pages with airport transfer details, payment plans for accommodations, and important travel document reminders. The platform lets you share vital destination information about local currency, customs, and weather expectations through a user-friendly interface. This complete approach to travel planning goes beyond what typical wedding websites provide, including Joy templates.

## [Joy – Tropical Bloom](https://withjoy.com/designs/?srsltid=AfmBOooeKggx4zkt3T8DTPWD0VhwevosccZ8YWjjyIZ2jqMnJmFMBWQB)

The Joy – Tropical Bloom template brings paradise to life with its lush and vibrant design. Couples planning beach celebrations will find this eye-catching template perfect to showcase their exotic wedding location. The design naturally draws attention with its immersive tropical elements.

### Joy – Tropical Bloom design features

Bold, bright colors fill the Tropical Bloom template’s rich palette, drawing inspiration from Matisse’s artistic style to create a paradise feel on your wedding website. Your guests will feel transported to your destination through stunning floral motifs and tropical elements. The template’s remarkable [customization potential](https://withjoy.com/blog/essential-features-to-add-when-customizing-your-wedding-site/?srsltid=AfmBOopEXqAaVSvgZJDgRakXfH_gjO51OUEKq_N2qkJ1TAW39ndKdtz-) lets you match colors and fonts to your wedding theme. Tech-savvy couples can use CSS code customization for advanced personalization. Your unique style shines through while the template’s tropical essence remains intact.

### Joy – Tropical Bloom RSVP tools

Tropical Bloom’s RSVP system does more than track guest responses. You can create custom schedules for different celebration events such as:

  * Rehearsal dinners
  * Bachelorette parties
  * Welcome receptions



The system shows guests only the events they need to see. This smart feature streamlines communication and prevents confusion – crucial for destination weddings with multiple activities. The RSVP tools merge naturally with travel planning features to help guests coordinate their flights and accommodations.

### Joy – Tropical Bloom [mobile experience](https://withjoy.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-choosing-an-online-wedding-planning-tool/?srsltid=AfmBOooVlwD9QZKhS8Km0ncDTApVwFV1bUitQcCo1JNKkKrk2cPb1xay)

Your phone becomes a tropical paradise with this template’s mobile experience. The design looks stunning on all devices. Guests won’t struggle with pinching and zooming like on traditional websites – they can use the companion mobile app to access wedding details on the go. The free app displays your schedule, accommodations, and vital information for traveling guests. The mobile platform includes photo sharing where guests add their captures to a shared gallery, which creates a visual story of your celebration together. This feature adds extra value to destination weddings as photos from different viewpoints make everyone’s experience richer.

## [Zola – Waterfront](https://www.zola.com/expert-advice/20-most-popular-zola-wedding-website-templates)

Zola’s Waterfront template brings a fresh esthetic that perfectly blends soft and bold elements to create the perfect backdrop for coastal celebrations. This design takes a unique artistic approach that sets it apart from other destination wedding websites, moving beyond typical beach themes.

### Zola – Waterfront design features

The Waterfront template combines soft elegance with bold visual elements beautifully. The template’s core design features asymmetrical borders that look like paint strokes, which add texture and catch your eye immediately. This artistic touch creates visual interest without overshadowing your wedding details. The template stays true to its minimalist roots while offering four [soft color options](https://withjoy.com/blog/wedding-color-ideas/?srsltid=AfmBOopSHF9F9HVr-EBYn2B5rQkZlHnb63WUcDXS-__3xhc7FnWsgyOa) that complement its breezy watercolor design. Couples who prefer subtle elegance over obvious beach themes will love its tranquil esthetic.

The calming color palette works wonderfully for wedding planning communications, just as we’ve seen with our Joy templates. Your guests will find it easy to find important details, thanks to a design that strikes the right balance between visual appeal and functionality.

### Zola – Waterfront mobile experience

A hidden menu bar makes the Waterfront template’s mobile version simple to use. While guests might question this design choice at first, they quickly discover how straightforward it is. The hidden navigation pairs perfectly with the template’s slideshow photo option. Your images become the star of the show without competing elements getting in the way.

My tests of the best wedding website for destination wedding options show that this approach creates a cleaner mobile look than always-visible menus. Mobile users can easily spot interface elements and find their way around the site.

### Zola – Waterfront ideal use cases

The Waterfront template shines at lakeside or garden weddings thanks to its [tranquil design elements](https://withjoy.com/blog/20-captivating-garden-wedding-theme/?srsltid=AfmBOophVcnZiuZp93mMNs-8bB_g0WwojPJup6WzoxZZRtnJMtY8dFel). The template’s versatility makes it perfect for any water-adjacent venue where you want to create an atmosphere of calm sophistication.

The built-in countdown timer adds an exciting touch. Your guests can share your excitement as they watch the days count down to your special day. Couples without technical expertise will appreciate the template’s user-friendly design. You can focus on planning your celebration instead of struggling with website tools.

## [Minted – Coastal Classic](https://www.minted.com/product/wedding-websites/MIN-MSH-DWW/sunset-beach)

Minted’s Coastal Classic distinguishes itself from many Joy templates through its artisan-crafted approach. This artistic template adds handcrafted elegance to destination wedding websites with its community-driven design philosophy.

### Minted – Coastal Classic design features

The beautiful frame with a coastal, toile-inspired pattern creates immediate seaside elegance. This template’s uniqueness comes from Minted’s community of independent artists rather than in-house designers. The artistic elements create a unified experience that extends beyond your digital presence. The design merges with matching stationery and day-of pieces—from invitations to thank you cards and even menus to [wedding](https://withjoy.com/) decor. You can preview how these design elements will look in print materials before finalizing your site to ensure visual consistency in all wedding communications.

### Minted – Coastal Classic [RSVP](https://withjoy.com/online-rsvp/) tools

The RSVP functionality strikes a perfect balance between beauty and practicality. Your guests will find an accessible interface that keeps the coastal theme while gathering important information. The system creates personalized wedding websites that match your RSVP cards perfectly. Coastal Classic offers special RSVP online enclosure cards that guide guests to your website for couples who want traditional paper invitations with their digital presence. These cards cost USD 60.00 for 15 pieces, and the price per unit drops as you order more.

### Minted – Coastal Classic pricing

Minted’s flexibility shows in its free and premium website options that fit different budgets. The simple website builder costs nothing, but premium templates like Coastal Classic typically range from USD 20.00-USD 50.00. Premium websites cost USD 15.00 for the first year and come with great features like:

  * Custom URLs for a personalized web address

Using a Minted wedding website earns you a USD 50.00 credit toward wedding stationery automatically, no code needed. Minted also provides a concierge service starting at USD 49.00 for couples wanting professional help.

## [Joy – Sunset Shore](https://withjoy.com/wedding-website/?srsltid=AfmBOoqByotLMkG8-QoX8E3Q00tofXEmZyC5J-1I5WtcnuTyuytlAGY_)

Sunset Shore stands out as one of Joy’s most beautiful templates that captures the peaceful magic of beach sunsets. Photographers know sunsets create a chance for “White-Balancing, Saturation, Silhouettes, subject isolation, and landscape angles”. These stunning visual elements are the foundations of this remarkable template.

### Joy – Sunset Shore design features

The Sunset Shore template displays rich sunset colors where warm oranges blend into deep purples across the background. The design adds subtle palm tree silhouettes against the setting sun that create depth without overshadowing your wedding details. Your guests will see these visual elements “crisp, clear, and colorful” on any device. The template has essential sections to share accommodations, event schedules, and travel details – key elements for destination weddings. Research shows that sunset beach visuals help viewers feel more relaxed, and this template uses that imagery throughout the layout.

### Joy – Sunset Shore mobile experience

The Sunset Shore template has a “companion mobile app so your guests can stay in the know and even upload photos to a shared gallery”. Most guests will access your site through this dedicated app instead of dealing with pinch-and-zoom on regular mobile browsers. Your guests can easily “book accommodations from your site” while on the go. The app connects with popular ride services and lets guests “hail a ride with Uber and Lyft directly from your app”.

### Joy – Sunset Shore customization options

The Sunset Shore template gives you plenty of ways to make it your own. You can “choose from any color” that matches your wedding theme. The template lets you “find the perfect font” to match your style. Tech-savvy couples can “get under the hood and change the CSS to tweak the little details”. Couples can “plan together without sharing passwords”, which makes shared planning simple. This mix of beautiful design and practical features makes Sunset Shore an ideal choice for destination weddings, giving you both style and substance.

## [Zola – Camden](https://www.zola.com/expert-advice/20-most-popular-zola-wedding-website-templates)

![Image](https://wsstgprdphotosonic01.blob.core.windows.net/photosonic/ac6d0453-325c-405c-b559-97dd74e2fa30.WEBP?st=2025-07-24T15%3A58%3A47Z&se=2025-07-31T15%3A58%3A47Z&sp=r&sv=2025-07-05&sr=b&sig=YuHIZBrH7bWjbUzQwKuaSPu/gk2fCZ4bl6XH%2BkTVMDU%3D)![Image](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Image Source: [Zola](https://www.zola.com)

Zola’s Camden design stands out from typical oceanic templates. It takes inspiration from mountain landscapes and works beautifully for many beach destinations. After looking at this template among our Joy offerings, I found that Camden gives couples a fresh alternative when they want a nature-inspired look that works in different outdoor settings.

### Zola – Camden design features

The Camden template features a beautiful line of watercolor trees with watercolor mountains that instantly connects with natural landscapes. The design comes in three color options – dark green, light green, and white. This lets couples pick a shade that matches their wedding colors perfectly. The watercolor illustrations add an artistic touch without looking too casual. The natural scenery elements create a peaceful backdrop that showcases wedding details without too many distractions.

### Zola – Camden mobile experience

Unfortunately, Camden’s mobile experience has some limitations you should think about. My research shows that Zola’s templates sometimes look different on phones compared to computers. Camden stays functional on all devices because of Zola’s platform technology. The template uses a simple drag-and-drop website builder that makes customization easy even if you’re not tech-savvy. The platform has useful features like password protection and custom domain options that work well on both phones and computers.

### Zola – Camden best for outdoor weddings

Camden was made for “lovers of the outdoors” and fits perfectly with nature-centered celebrations. Of course, this template works great for weddings in “epic outdoor” settings. While Joy’s templates usually focus on beach themes, Camden offers a flexible outdoor approach that’s great for:

  * Beachfront weddings near forests or mountains
  * Coastal celebrations in areas with mixed landscapes
  * Destination weddings where water meets woodland



Camden ended up being a fantastic option for couples who want the best wedding website for destination weddings that have natural elements beyond beaches.

## [Appy Couple – Beach Luxe](https://www.appycouple.com/signup/)

The Appy Couple – Beach Luxe template stands out with its exclusive elegance. This sophisticated digital platform delivers an unmatched experience for luxury seaside weddings. Unlike our Joy templates, this design combines a responsive website and dedicated mobile app into one unified system that communicates wedding details beautifully.

### Appy Couple – Beach Luxe design features

Beach Luxe captivates guests with full-screen video and photo cover pages right from the start. The template’s flexible sections come with customizable titles and visibility options. You can arrange everything just the way you want to showcase your coastal wedding. Different layout choices help you display your luxury beach celebration’s details in the most elegant way. The template’s quality shines through user feedback, with many calling it “beautiful” and simple to personalize without technical expertise.

### Appy Couple – Beach Luxe RSVP tools

Beach Luxe makes guest communication smooth with specialized RSVP features:

  * RSVP Notes – great to alert guests about crucial details (like “the last ferry to the venue leaves at 4:00 pm”)
  * Question widgets – perfect to collect yes/no answers about transportation needs

You can check individual guest selections or see all RSVP information in a united table format. The system lets you adjust guest responses manually whenever needed.

The dedicated mobile app reshapes the scene of guest interaction with your wedding details. Users love the app-website combination and often mention that “designing the website was easy”. Guests can download the app from the App Store or Google Play and access wedding details through a unique wedding code. The app’s live photo sharing feature lets guests upload images during your celebration, which turns your site into a dynamic photo feed. This level of smooth integration makes Beach Luxe one of the best wedding websites to plan destination weddings where mobile communication matters most.

Our Joy – Coral Coast template draws inspiration from one of the world’s most stunning coastlines. The natural beauty of coral reef environments comes alive in this digital format. Couples planning exotic beach weddings will find both visual appeal and practical functionality in this template.

### Joy – Coral Coast design features

The Coral Coast template brings vibrant colors that reflect the rich marine ecosystem of coral reefs. Subtle coral motifs and ocean elements create a sophisticated coastal atmosphere without overshadowing your wedding details. Your engagement photos will look “crisp, clear, and colorful” on any screen size. The design brings natural elements that remind you of “beautiful flowers and trees” to create an engaging experience. Artistic couples will appreciate the “3-dimensional” quality of visual elements. The design casts gentle shadows as light plays with different elements, similar to sunlight filtering through ocean waters.

### Joy – Coral Coast mobile experience

Communication with traveling guests becomes simple with this template. The Coral Coast template “comes with a companion mobile app so your guests can stay in the know and even upload photos to a shared gallery”. Users can choose between free and paid wifi options. Many users say the free option runs “faster than cable internet” – perfect for guests finding their way in new places. The app’s integrated mapping gives turn-by-turn directions to your venue. The “Coconut Wireless newsletter” keeps everyone updated about activities and local information daily.

### Joy – Coral Coast guestbook features

The Coral Coast template stands out among destination wedding websites because of its unique guestbook alternatives. The digital guestbook lets you:

  * Share photos instantly where guests help create a collaborative visual story
  * Add interactive elements for guests to leave personal messages with their images
  * Use custom layouts that keep the coral theme throughout the guest experience



Traditional guestbooks become dynamic communication tools where wedding memories live on digitally. Many couples love how the system works as a planning tool before the wedding and preserves memories afterward. The guestbook works naturally with the “shared photo gallery” to create a complete record of your celebration from many angles.

Image Source: [Zola](https://www.zola.com)

Zola’s Folly template bursts with vibrant colors and playful motifs, bringing celebratory energy that’s perfect for tropical beach weddings. The template proves a worthy match for our Joy templates, standing out with its distinctively cheerful approach to destination wedding websites.

### Zola – Folly design features

The bright colored fruit and flower elements immediately grab attention and create a festive atmosphere for your wedding site. Couples can showcase their relationship photos in dedicated spaces that blend seamlessly with the vibrant design elements. The template creates what Zola calls a “fun vibe” through its colorful botanical imagery. This design shines particularly bright for specific seasonal celebrations—making it the perfect choice for spring, fall, or summer weddings where seasonal produce might take center stage in your menu and décor.

### Zola – Folly mobile experience

The template keeps its functionality intact across devices with a user-friendly mobile interface. A hidden menu bar helps users direct themselves once they start exploring the site. The slideshow photo feature works smoothly with this optimized navigation and displays your images without competing visual elements. Many users point out that the hidden menu “stands out good enough” that even guests who aren’t tech-savvy can find their way around the mobile site easily.

### Zola – Folly ideal for tropical weddings

The template’s design esthetic creates the perfect backdrop for beach celebrations with a festive atmosphere. Bright fruits and floral elements naturally capture the tropical destination feel without needing explicit ocean imagery. The template works beautifully for couples planning weddings in beach locations like its namesake—Folly Beach—a stunning wedding destination known for “acres of white sand and sparkling ocean views”.

Unlike Joy templates that often use literal ocean motifs, Folly takes a fresh approach with playful botanical elements to suggest a tropical paradise. This makes it one of the best wedding websites for destination wedding couples who want to create a vacation atmosphere without typical beach clichés.

## [Minted – Seafoam Elegance](https://www.minted.com/beach-wedding-invitations)

Seafoam Elegance stands out in Minted’s vast collection. This wedding website template brings an artistic coastal appeal that perfectly suits beach ceremonies. My experience with many templates on Joy’s platform has shown me Minted’s distinctive way of combining digital and physical wedding elements.

### Minted – Seafoam Elegance design features

The artistic sophistication of Seafoam Elegance shines through its ocean-inspired esthetics. Creo Study from Mumbai created this template that expresses Minted’s dedication to independent artists’ work. The design employs “the most luxurious paper and printing techniques” for physical stationery and creates a unified wedding identity. The template naturally maintains visual consistency between digital and print materials. Your beach wedding theme flows from website to invitations without missing a beat.

### Minted – Seafoam Elegance RSVP tools

Seafoam Elegance’s RSVP system goes beyond conventional solutions. The platform lets you “set deadlines for RSVPs, create custom questions to gather dietary restrictions or song requests”. The system tracks meal priorities and plus-one details in one place. Users can “easily manage RSVPs, remind guests, and connect with them by using the built-in capabilities”. Guest information updates appear in the user-friendly management interface right away.

### Minted – Seafoam Elegance pricing

Minted offers several pricing tiers that work for different budgets. The simple website includes essential features at no cost. Premium features are available at “USD 15.00 for the first year” with valuable additions like “custom URLs, photo galleries, and password protection”. Your Minted wedding website comes with a “USD 50.00 credit toward wedding stationery with no code required”. Couples looking for extra help can use a “concierge service starting from USD 49.00” to streamline their planning.

## [Joy – Island Romance](https://withjoy.com/designs/?srsltid=AfmBOoqWlVjsMXoAkCrcuwqfvPqm_xmbafC1AWT3cwJymxCCEAQ6Ix2A)

The Joy – Island Romance template captures the essence of beautiful island weddings. This design draws inspiration from butterfly-shaped tropical paradises with pristine white sand beaches. The template brings the authentic feeling of island escapes to life and provides everything you need to plan your wedding naturally.

### Joy – Island Romance design features

The Island Romance template brings tropical elegance to life through its carefully crafted visuals. Our design takes inspiration from “beautiful tropical vegetation” and stunning “turquoise lagoon” environments. The spacious layouts showcase your engagement photos with remarkable clarity, and your images stay “crisp, clear, and colorful” on every device. Your guests will feel transported to your island destination before they arrive. The butterfly-shaped layout and subtle maritime touches create the feeling of standing on pristine beaches with “breathtaking views of the Indian Ocean”.

### Joy – Island Romance mobile experience

Our mobile functionality changes how guests connect with your wedding details. The website combines smoothly with our “companion mobile app” so guests can access all wedding information while traveling. Guests who download the free app can view schedules, accommodations, and “upload photos to a shared gallery” to create a visual story together. The built-in map provides “turn-by-turn directions” to your venue, which helps out-of-town guests find their way. Our users call this the “go-to wedding planner in your pocket”.

### Joy – Island Romance RSVP tools

The RSVP system makes managing guest responses simple for your island celebration. The system lets you:

  * Track attendance for “multiple events” from rehearsal dinners to post-wedding brunches
  * Collect important details like “meal choices” and “song requests” through customizable questions
  * Handle “plus ones” by choosing which guests can bring additional attendees



Guests can “RSVP on behalf of their party” whether they travel as a family or couple. Their responses update your guest list automatically, giving you up-to-the-minute attendance numbers. This feature becomes essential when you coordinate complex destination wedding logistics across several events.

## [Zola – Milky Way](https://www.zola.com/expert-advice/wedding-website-examples-and-inspiration-themes-and-designs)

Image Source: [Zola](https://www.zola.com)

The Zola – Milky Way template stands out among celestial-inspired wedding websites with its nighttime elegance. A comparison between Joy’s beach templates and this starry design shows Milky Way brings a unique approach to couples who plan evening beach celebrations.

### Zola – Milky Way design features

The Milky Way template engages visitors with a dramatic navy blue backdrop that showcases your wedding details. White text creates a striking contrast against the dark background and makes everything easy to read. Each page features gold foil, confetti-like dots that add glamor like stars twinkling in the night sky. A bold sans serif font brings an urban celebratory feel to the design that balances cosmic themes with city sophistication. This design beautifully represents a romantic evening under the stars without using direct beach imagery.

### Zola – Milky Way mobile experience

My review of various destination wedding websites shows that Zola’s platform makes all templates, including Milky Way, work perfectly on mobile devices. Your guests will have an uninterrupted experience whether they view your site on a phone or computer. The easy-to-use interface remains available to guests with basic tech knowledge. Most importantly, guests can find wedding details quickly while they travel to your event.

### Zola – Milky Way best for night beach weddings

This template works perfectly for these wedding scenarios:

  * Ceremonies planned under starlit skies
  * Couples who love astronomy
  * Anyone wanting to add romantic starry night elements
  * Beach weddings during evening hours



The Milky Way template serves as a dreamy alternative to Joy’s daytime beach templates and creates a customized atmosphere for your wedding website. Couples who plan to exchange vows as stars appear over the ocean will love the template’s dramatic navy backdrop.
