## **At-Home Proposals**

![Man holding ring box out to surprised woman during a candlelit dinner at home](https://withjoy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/at-home-proposals-1024x682.jpg)![Man holding ring box out to surprised woman during a candlelit dinner at home](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201024%20682%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Sometimes, the most meaningful moments unfold within the comforting walls of a home. Whether you’re surrounded by the coziness of your living room, the warmth of your kitchen, or the serenity of your backyard, an [at-home proposal](https://withjoy.com/blog/home-proposal-ideas/) may be the perfect fit for you and your partner.

### **1\. With a romantic meal at home**

Transform your home into a romantic haven by preparing a special meal for your proposal. Share a delicious dinner you’ve prepared yourself or, if you’re not an expert in the kitchen, order dinner from your favorite restaurant. Then add candlelight, soft music, and flowers to create a cozy atmosphere and an ideal setting for the big question.

### **2\. Involve your pets**

If you’re a pet-loving couple, involving your furry family members may be a no-brainer when the time comes to ask that special question. Tie the engagement ring to your pet’s collar or include them meaningfully in your proposal, making it a moment you’ll cherish together.

### **3\. With breakfast in bed**

Surprise your partner with breakfast in bed to set the stage for a sweet and intimate proposal. You can hide the ring in a fluffy croissant or display the ring box on a tray alongside fresh flowers, hot coffee, and a delicious meal for your love.

### **4\. With a photo montage**

Compile your best memories into a heartfelt photo montage leading up to the moment you pop the question. Whether you create a temporary gallery wall in your living room or hang photos from trees in your backyard, a proposal surrounded by all those special memories will feel incredibly romantic.

### **5\. With their favorite food**

It’s often said that food is the way to one’s heart, so a proposal with food makes total sense. If your partner loves desserts, why not propose with a tray of personalized cupcakes or a box of custom chocolates? The same goes for just about any food — we think a pizza proposal would be especially fun.

### **6\. Create a special space in your home**

Take the time to design a unique space in your home where your partner will find a surprise proposal waiting. Consider using candles, fairy lights, and piles of blankets and pillows to create a cozy and intimate setting. Or use rose petals to lead to a bubble-filled bathtub for two with Champagne at the ready.

### **7\. Make a playlist**

For most of us, there are songs that remind us of a moment, person, or feeling. Many couples have special songs that have become “theirs.” Make a playlist of favorite songs that tell your love story through music. You can play it as a backdrop to your proposal or record a personalized proposal as the surprise final track.

### **8\. Say it with your favorite game**

For game night enthusiasts, plan a proposal using your favorite game. Spell out your love with Scrabble’s iconic letter tiles, write out the words on the Queen of Hearts in a deck of cards, or slip the ring onto the Luxury Tax square on a Monopoly board. No matter what game you prefer, this will add a fun and playful twist to your engagement moment.

## **Outdoor Proposals**

![Couple standing in front of beautiful outdoor landscape hugging while man kisses woman's forehead](https://withjoy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/outdoor-proposals-1024x682.jpg)![Couple standing in front of beautiful outdoor landscape hugging while man kisses woman's forehead](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201024%20682%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

There are endless proposal possibilities amidst nature’s beauty. Whether it’s beneath a canopy of stars, beside a tranquil lake, or among the scenic rooftop garden views above a busy city, these [outdoor proposals](https://withjoy.com/blog/outdoor-proposal-ideas/) will help you create unforgettable moments in the heart of Mother Nature.

### **9\. At a historic landmark**

With options ranging from the Grand Canyon to the Lincoln Memorial, a historic monument or landmark can make for a lovely place to propose. There are over [2,600 national historic landmarks](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/nationalhistoriclandmarks/list-of-nhls-by-state.htm) across the United States alone, so there’s sure to be one near you. Propose amidst the grandeur of history, adding your own chapter to the legacy of the place you choose.

### **10\. During a picnic**

If you’ve been graced with a beautiful sunny day, a picnic in a scenic spot makes for a lovely place to propose. Prepare your favorite foods, grab a bottle of wine, pack a picnic blanket, and head to a park, lake, or beach that you both love. Then, let the natural surroundings set the scene for your heartfelt question.

### **11\. Under the stars**

There’s something so romantic about an evening under the stars. Whether relaxing on a blanket by a lake or enjoying the night sky in your backyard, the view above is always magical. If your partner’s eyes light up at stargazing, just imagine the smile on their face as they look down to see you on one knee.

### **12\. At the beach**

The beach offers a picturesque backdrop for a romantic proposal. Make the moment your own by taking your partner for a romantic walk along the beach or stage a sunset picnic for two before popping the question. You can even have your friends help by writing out “Will you marry me?” in the sand before you get there. Whether it’s a sunrise, sunset, or a moonlit night, the serene shores create an idyllic atmosphere for a [beachside engagement](https://withjoy.com/blog/beach-proposal-ideas/). 

### **13\. In a treehouse**

Thanks to apps like Airbnb, Vrbo, and Hipcamp, you can fulfill your childhood dreams with a treehouse proposal. Rent a whimsical small house among the trees to create a magical moment for a playful way to pop the question.

### ****14\. At a rooftop bar during sunset****

Watching the sun disappear along the horizon from a rooftop bar provides a picturesque and timeless moment for a proposal. The breathtaking view, flowing cocktails, and happy atmosphere will help the celebrations continue once you’re officially engaged.

### ****15\. A hike in the mountains****

There’s something about a mountain view that takes your breath away. Whether you make it to the top of a mountain or not, the breathtaking vistas and seclusion make a hike in the mountains a perfect time and place to propose to your true love in a romantic way.

### **16\. At a local park**

Your local park can easily become the canvas for a romantic engagement. You could start off with a slow stroll to enjoy the natural environment, feed the ducks, or just sit and enjoy the fresh air. Then, a simple, in-the-moment proposal makes for a sweet and memorable way to start the next phase of your life together.

## ****Romantic Proposals****

![Overhead close-up of a man sitting with his legs crossed and holding an open ring box in his hands ](https://withjoy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/romantic-proposals-1024x682.jpg)![Overhead close-up of a man sitting with his legs crossed and holding an open ring box in his hands ](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201024%20682%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Lean into celebrating your love with this array of intimate and heartwarming proposal ideas that are destined to sweep your partner off their feet. From rose petal bubble baths to scenic sunset moments, these proposals will help you bring the romance to your big moment.

### ****17\. On your anniversary****

One of the most romantic ways to pop the question is on the anniversary of your first date or the date you became a couple. Turn up the “awww” factor even further and set the scene with photographs of the two of you, tickets from concerts you’ve seen, and souvenirs from trips and getaways together.

### **18\. In a fancy hotel room**

A hotel room decked out in rose petals, soft lighting, and keepsakes of your time together can make for a romantic and elegant setting to ask the big question. It’s private and luxurious, and you can enjoy the special moment longer without being interrupted by well-meaning passersby.

### ****19\. On a romantic walk****

Craft a poem that reveals the depth of your feelings so you can propose with the power of words. Or choose your favorite from a beloved poet and ask your partner to read it aloud while you go down on one knee. Poetry can express love in a way that’s uniquely tender and romantic, making your proposal a beautiful declaration of your love.

### **20\. With a poem**

>  Principal Planner & Designer, [Nóbl Events](https://www.noblevents.co/)

### ****21\. On a special vacation****

If you have a once-in-a-lifetime trip coming up, why not use it as the perfect excuse to propose? Whether it’s Paris, Hawaii, the Poconos, or anywhere special to you two, you can bring romance to any vacation to create the perfect proposal moment. Surrounded by new experiences and adventure, a far-off locale will add a sense of grandeur to your engagement story.

### ****22\. During a couple’s photoshoot****

Capture the big moment of your proposal with a couple’s photoshoot, preserving the experience for a lifetime. Plan a special day to have your favorite photographer take romantic photos of you and your love. Surprise them with the question during the session to have both of your reactions documented in real time.

### ****23\. Write some love letters or love notes****

Write a series of heartfelt love letters or love notes, each revealing a piece of your heart, and propose as your partner reads the last one. You could aim to write one each month for a year or perhaps one for every month or year you’ve been together. Or you could focus on writing one perfect love letter for this big moment. The personal touch of handwritten letters can make your proposal intimate and unforgettable.

### ****24\. Create a special sign****

If you plan to set the scene for your big moment, a lovingly made banner or sign can make it all the more personal. Wooden signs are popular, as are canvas banners adorned with “Will you marry me?” or something similar. You could also consider renting marquee lights to spell out “marry me” or highlight both of your initials. As a bonus, the visual impact of a romantic sign looks amazing on social media.

## ****Fun Proposals****

### **25\. Say it with balloons**

Go for a playful and colorful approach by expressing your love with balloons. It’s fun, very Instagram-worthy, and adds a lighthearted element of surprise to your proposal. If you’re going to propose somewhere that you can set up ahead of time, stage your balloons to spell out your partner’s name or “Will you marry me?”

### **26\. Make a handmade ring box**

If crafting is your thing, you can achieve a unique and heartfelt moment with a handmade ring box that you create yourself. This personal touch transforms the proposal experience into a truly one-of-a-kind event and provides another keepsake for your partner besides the ring itself.

### ****27\. Create a personalized jigsaw puzzle****

Add a touch of mystery and adventure with a custom puzzle proposal. Let your partner piece together the story of your love, building anticipation until the final reveal. You can hide the question somewhere within the puzzle or let your loved one turn over the right piece to find a special question on the reverse side.

### ****28\. Karaoke night****

Whisk your partner off to your favorite karaoke bar to sing your hearts out to your special song. Then surprise them with a heartfelt serenade and the ultimate proposal moment. It’s a sweet and entertaining way to pop the question, made even more fun with your friends and family there to cheer you on. 

### ****29\. Build a website or computer game****

If you’re handy with coding or your partner is always online, creating your very own digital proposal will certainly rank high in the “unforgettable” department. Build a website or develop a computer game dedicated to your love story, culminating in a surprise proposal. It’s an innovative approach combining technology and romance, creating a proposal experience like no other.

### ****30\. Write it in the sky****

Keep their eyes looking up as a plane writes your love in the sky with a skywriting proposal that’s sure to leave your partner in awe. The grand gesture and the vastness of the sky will surely create a breathtaking and memorable moment.

### ****31\. Hidden inside****

Add an element of surprise with a hidden proposal, whether it’s tucked inside a candy treat, a favorite toy, or a fortune cookie. The sudden and unexpected reveal adds a layer of excitement and creativity to your engagement.

### ****32\. With a celebrity Cameo****

Make your partner’s day with a celebrity Cameo from their favorite artist, where a famous personality delivers your heartfelt proposal over video while you get down on one knee. This unique and star-studded approach adds an extra layer of magic and fun to your special moment.

## ****Adventurous Proposals****

### **34\. Plan a scavenger hunt**

You can create an exciting and interactive experience for your partner by planning a scavenger hunt proposal. Each clue or location should hold a special meaning (perhaps your first date location and other spots you’ve visited together), building anticipation for the final, heartfelt reveal. As a twist, try arranging a themed treasure hunt that ties in something your partner loves, like movies, pets, or hobbies. 

### ****35\. On a boat****

For water lovers, a proposal on a boat can be thrilling. You can plan a private boat trip with a romantic meal and live music, or keep it simple and sweet by taking a canoe out on your favorite lake. Plus, the symbolism of being on a boat as you ask your partner to embark on a new lifelong journey with you is priceless.

Challenge your partner’s wits by crafting a unique escape room storyline that centers around your relationship, creating a narrative that intertwines your journey together with cryptic clues and riddles.

## **Proposals in Public**

Weave together a collection of video clips from your loved ones, as well as your vacations, holidays, and the two of you relaxing at home to create a montage. Then, at the end of the video, you can ask them to marry you. Be sure to share the final video with the family and friends who contributed as a way to include them in your special moment.

### **51\. Include your kids**

If you have children, including them in your proposal builds a beautiful family memory and strengthens your new family’s bond. This special moment of unity marks the beginning of a beautiful chapter together.

### **52\. Incorporate family traditions**

Weaving family traditions into your proposal is a heartfelt nod to your roots. You may have an engagement ring that’s been passed down for generations or a particular proposal spot significant to your family. Being mindful of such traditions allows you to share your love story with friends and family by connecting your past and future.

>  “Don’t feel like you have to do it alone! Feel free to use a family member, friend, or even a hired professional to help you with the logistics. Whether it be an intimate moment, or a party surrounded by family or friends, using your support system will create a seamless experience for you to not have to worry about anything but asking the big question!”

### **53\. Surprise signage assistance**

With a little help from friends or family, you can surprise your partner with heartwarming signs that lead to your proposal spot or ask the big question for you. Their involvement makes this important moment even more memorable.

### **54\. Host an after-party**

If you’re looking for an intimate proposal with just you and your partner but also want to celebrate with your loved ones, consider planning an after-party. It will give friends and family the opportunity to shower you with love and congratulations right after the big moment.

### **55\. Celebrate your cultures**

For some couples, it’s especially important to celebrate both of their heritages during a proposal. If that’s true for you, this could lead you to seek approval from your partner’s parents in advance or select a very specific type of engagement ring. No matter what cultural traditions you follow, it’s a beautiful way to honor and include friends and family in your love story.

### **56\. Play charades with the family**

Engage in a game of charades with friends and family where your proposal becomes the ultimate guess. Slip a piece of paper with the words “Will you marry me?” into the bowl and wait for the clues to come. Having your loved ones participate just adds to the fun of this memorable moment.

## **Seasonal Proposals**

Celebrate the magic of different times of the year with your upcoming proposal. Whether it’s under a blanket of snow, amid warm summer winds, or during the cozy fall season, these ideas embrace the unique charm of various holidays and seasons.

### **57\. Winter holiday love**

There’s something magical about proposing during the winter holidays, whether it’s amidst twinkling Christmas lights, the warmth of Hanukkah candles, or the cultural traditions of Kwanzaa. Looking for inspiration? Wrap their engagement ring as their final gift to open on the eighth night of Hanukkah, propose in front of your community during the Karamu feast, or get down on one knee under some carefully placed mistletoe.

### **58\. Valentine’s Day romance**

For some, Valentine’s Day is considered the [quintessential day for romance](https://withjoy.com/blog/valentines-day-proposal-ideas/). If your partner loves this holiday, it could be an ideal backdrop for your proposal. Whether you ramp up the romance for your big moment or opt for a simple proposal at home, you can make February 14 the day your partner officially becomes your fiancé(e).

### **59\. Halloween surprise**

Do you and your partner love Halloween? A proposal on October 31 is often unexpected and adds a dash of spooky fun to your love story. Imagine the thrill of finding a ring in a jack-o’-lantern or candy bowl. Or suggest a couple’s costume of a famous married duo so the engagement ring is needed to complete the look.

### **60\. New Year’s Eve**

What better way to start the year than with a proposal? Proposing at the stroke of midnight on New Year’s Eve symbolizes a fresh start and the promise of a beautiful future together. The holiday pairs perfectly with an engagement when you’re both surrounded by Champagne and already dressed up to celebrate the new year.

### **61\. Celebrate fall leaves**

Fall’s stunning colors and crisp air provide a cozy and Instagram-worthy setting for your [autumnal proposal](https://withjoy.com/blog/fall-proposal-ideas/). Take a walk through the falling leaves until the moment feels right. Or spell out the question using fallen leaves you’ve collected. No matter how you do it, you can expect a heartwarming moment that mirrors the beauty of the season.

### **62\. Write it in the snow**

A proposal written in the snow is a temporary ode to your enduring love that will live on in pictures. The snow makes for a romantic canvas where you can express your feelings in a way that’s uniquely yours. Bring a thermos of hot cocoa to warm you both up once the proposal adrenaline wears off.

### **63\. Be extra thankful at Thanksgiving**

Proposing on Thanksgiving brings a whole new layer of gratitude and love to this special day. With family typically coming together to celebrate, it makes for a wonderful time to pop the question. 

### **64\. Fourth of July fireworks**

Capitalize on the warm summer nights and fireworks that come with the Fourth of July for your proposal. It’s a dazzling way to make your moment stand out and create unforgettable memories.

## **Marriage Proposal FAQ**

The answers to these common questions about planning that perfect proposal may help ease your nerves.

****Should I propose before or after dinner?****

Either option works well, and the decision largely depends on the personal preferences of you and your partner. Some couples prefer a romantic proposal before dinner, setting the stage for a special evening. Others might enjoy the surprise at the end of a romantic meal. Consider what would make the moment special for both of you to determine the right time for your big moment.

****Which knee do you propose on?****

There’s no hard-and-fast rule about which knee to propose on, so don’t overthink it! It’s more about your personal comfort and your partner’s expectations. Many people propose by going down on their left knee, which is a common practice. However, you should choose the knee that feels most natural to you and suits the moment. Ultimately, it’s the love and sincerity behind the proposal that matters most.

****What is the average length of an engagement?****

The length of an engagement can vary widely and depends on the preferences and circumstances of each couple. While some choose a relatively short engagement, lasting six months to a year, others opt for longer engagements, spanning two years or more. It’s all about what suits your wedding planning timeline and the pace at which you and your partner are comfortable.
