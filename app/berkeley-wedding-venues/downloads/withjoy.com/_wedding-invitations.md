### Frequently Asked Questions

Take a look at our most commonly asked questions and answers. For additional support chat with us.

Can you send wedding invites instead of Save the Dates?

While Save the Dates are typically sent before wedding invitations, it is possible to send invitations directly if you are short on time. Sending invitations instead of Save the Dates is especially practical if your wedding is approaching quickly and you need to ensure that all your guests are informed as soon as possible. However, keep in mind that Save the Dates provide early notice and can help guests manage their schedules better, so itâs worth considering if you have the time.

Does Joy have matching paper and digital wedding invitations?

Yes! Joy offers both paper and online digital wedding invites in hundreds of designs. Customize your cards to match your wedding style, and send them by post, email, or text message. Itâs easy to reach all your guests, whether theyâre local or abroad. Many couples choose to mix and match digital and paper wedding stationery to suit their needs. With Joy, you can design once and send anywhere. 

When should we send out our wedding invitations?

Wedding invitations should be sent out 6-8 weeks before the wedding date. This time frame allows your guests enough time to respond and make any necessary arrangements. If youâre planning a destination wedding or a large event, consider sending invitations 3 months in advance. This gives your guests ample time to arrange travel, book accommodations, and plan their schedule. Sending invitations early also helps avoid last-minute stress and ensures that all your guests receive the information they need in a timely manner.

How do I collect addresses for my wedding invitations?

Joyâs built-in Contact Collector makes it easy to gather all your guestsâ contact information in your guest list. Simply share your magic link with guests, they fill out a quick form, and your guest list grows automagically. Every Joy wedding invitation includes free recipient and return address printing that integrates seamlessly with your contact list. 

What information should we include on our wedding invitations?

A wedding invitation card should include several key pieces of information to ensure that your guests have all the details they need. Essential details include the names of the couple, the wedding date, time, and location. Additionally, itâs helpful to include information about the reception, if applicable, and any special instructions such as dress code or parking information. Providing your wedding website URL on the invitation is also a great way to offer guests access to additional details and updates.

How many wedding invitations should I order?

When ordering wedding invitations, youâll want to order one invitation per household, which is not the same as the number of total guests. Itâs advisable to order at least 10-25 extra invitations to account for any mistakes, last-minute additions, or keepsakes. This extra buffer ensures that you have enough invitations for any unexpected changes or additional guests. Most printers, including Joy, offer discounts for bulk orders, so ordering a few extra invitations can be a cost-effective way to ensure that youâre prepared.

Do you have to send physical RSVP cards with wedding invitations?

Giving guests the option to RSVP online or via paper can be a nice gesture. However, more and more couples are choosing to include online RSVP instructions on their wedding invitations instead of sending RSVP cards. Which option is right for you? Weâd say it definitely depends on your specific guest list and how comfortable most of your invitees will be with sending their response electronically.

I am mailing physical RSVPs, but want to collect responses digitally. Do you support that?

Absolutely. Include the link to your wedding website on your printed wedding RSVP card and configure Joy's guest list to allow any guest to add their own plus ones when they RSVP online.

Do you offer printed wedding stationery that matches my wedding website?

Yes! All of our most popular website designs are available with matching stationery, including Save the Date cards, invitations, thank-you notes and more.

Why choose Joy for wedding invitations?

Joy offers a seamless and user-friendly experience for creating wedding invitations that perfectly match your style and needs. Our platform features a wide range of customizable designs, from classic and elegant to modern and playful. With Joy, you can easily personalize your invitations to reflect your wedding theme and preferences. Our intuitive design tools allow you to choose colors, fonts, and layouts, ensuring that your invitations are uniquely yours.  
  
Joy also provides integrated features to manage your guest list and RSVPs. By connecting your wedding website with your invitations, you can provide guests with a centralized location for all the information they need, including the RSVP process. This integration simplifies your planning and helps you keep track of responses efficiently.

Can I order a sample from Joy?

Yes, Joy offers the option to order samples of your wedding invitations. This allows you to review the design, quality, and overall appearance before placing a full order. Ordering a sample is a valuable step in the planning process, as it helps ensure that the final product meets your expectations. You can check the color accuracy, paper quality, and print clarity, making any necessary adjustments before finalizing your order.

Can we get prints shipped outside of the US?

Yes! Prints ordered from Joyâs print partner Paperlust can be shipped internationally and come in many designs with matching wedding websites.

How long will it take to design and print my invitations?

The production time for wedding invitations typically varies based on the complexity of your design and the volume of your order. Generally, it takes one to two weeks to print and deliver your invitations. To ensure that you receive your invitations on time, itâs a good idea to plan ahead and place your order well in advance of your mailing date. Joyâs platform provides estimated delivery times and keeps you informed throughout the process, so you know exactly when to expect your order.

What is the cost of 100 wedding invitations?

The cost of wedding invitations can vary based on several factors, including the design, printing options, and any additional features such as foil stamping or letterpress. Joy offers a range of pricing options to fit different budgets. For a standard set of 100 printed invitations, you can explore Joyâs pricing details online to find the best fit for your needs. Keep in mind that ordering in larger quantities or choosing basic printing options can help reduce the overall cost.

How many extra wedding invitations should we order?

To be safe, you should consider buying 10-25 extra wedding invites, depending on how invitations are sold at your preferred printer.

Do wedding invitations go out before the bridal shower? 

It varies. Bridal showers are typically held three months to three weeks before the wedding date, while wedding invites should be sent 6-8 weeks before the big day. Given the overlap in these potential timelines, itâs common for bridal showers to occur both before and after formal invitations are sent.

How is Joyâs invites and online wedding RSVP system better?

Our invites and RSVPs are connected straight to your guest list, meaning when your guests respond their answers will appear right where you need them. No more manually inputting everyoneâs responses; we do the dirty work for you. Joy's one-of-a-kind system also allows you to collect RSVPs to multiple wedding events such as your wedding reception, brunch, or rehearsal dinner.

What does Joy cost?

Joy wedding websites, planning tools, registry, and online RSVP are free! Paper wedding invitations come in a range of price and style options, and all include free back-of-card printing and free recipient and return address printing. On a tight budget? Mix and match Joyâs digital and paper cards to save money on paper and postage. Hundreds of digital wedding invitation designs are available to send for free.

Do you have a support team we can reach out to if we have questions?

Absolutely! Our amazing support team works hard around the clock, every day of the week, including weekends, to make sure that your questions are answered. You can send us an email at support@withjoy.com.

Should you include a wedding registry on your wedding invitation?

Your wedding invitation should focus on the essential details of your event, such as your names, the date, time, and location of your wedding ceremony. Avoid including registry information, as it can give the impression that your celebration is centered around gifts. Instead, keep the focus on the joy of your big day.

Is it okay to send digital wedding invitations?

Absolutely! While receiving creative save-the-date cards in the mail can be delightful, paperless invitations are a perfectly acceptable and practical alternative.  
  
An electronic version not only makes it easier to share important details but also seamlessly directs your guests to the ultimate source of information: your wedding website. Plus, you'll be doing your part to save the environment, and your loved ones will appreciate having everything they need right at their fingertips.

Do you need to send an invitation if you've already sent a save-the-date?

Absolutely. Once you've announced your wedding date, your guests are likely marking their calendars and making plans to celebrate with you and your partner.  
  
In many cases, especially for destination weddings or out-of-town guests, travel arrangements may already be in motion. Not following up with a formal invitation at this stage would be a communication misstep. Ensure you have a formal invite ready to provide all the details your guests need to finalize their travel plans and accommodations.

How to include a wedding website on an invite?

If you want to make it simple for guests to give you a gift you'll truly appreciate, your wedding website is the perfect place to share registry details. Creating a registry page is quick and easy with Joy's registry tool, and you can update it anytime.  
  
To guide guests to your wedding website, include a separate enclosure card with your wedding invitations. This card can simply direct them to your site without specifically mentioning the registry, as it will be an easy-to-find section once they visit.

What should wedding invitations include?

Your wedding invitation should include the names of the couple, the wedding date and time, the locations of both the ceremony and reception, the names of the hosts (if applicable), any dress code information, and a response card with a self-addressed, stamped envelope for RSVPs.

Whose Name Goes First on Wedding Invitation cards?

When it comes to wedding invitation wording, traditionally, the woman's name is placed first on the wedding invitation card. However, feel free to deviate from tradition and choose whichever name order feels right for youâafter all, marriages are about love, and the order of names is not what's most important.

Can I Add QR Codes and Links to Cards?

Yes! Whether you're sending a paper or digital card, you can easily add a QR code or link to share additional details with your guests. It's a great way to provide them with easy access to your wedding website, registry, or other important information. Visit for [details](https://withjoy.com/help/en/articles/10317109-how-to-add-qr-codes-and-links-to-cards)

Can I order a free sample before making a purchase?

We don't provide sample kits or proofs of specific cards, but we can send you a sample bundle to showcase our paper and print quality. Simply fill out the form [here](https://withjoy.typeform.com/to/YWn45VoV), and we'll get those samples mailed to you.

Does Joy have wedding invitations for different wedding styles?

Yes, Joy offers a wide variety of wedding invitation design and template options, enabling you to create invitations that match various wedding styles, from classic to modern and rustic to elegant, all within one platform.

What paper types are available at Joy?

We know how time-consuming and tricky RSVPs can be to keep track of. Which is why weâve worked so hard to create a system that makes the process effortless. Eliminating the need to physically update a lengthy spreadsheet, or mess around making notes on scraps of paper.

We look after every digital response for you, no matter how many events youâre planning. Grouping guests based on any dynamic you desire, and presenting everyone in a format that instantly makes sense, and is always up-to-date.

Joy also allows you to gather essential details from your guests well in advance of the big dayâand itâs not just about the classic âChicken or Fish?â question. You can ask anything, from meal preferences and allergies to accommodation needs and DJ requests.

Whatâs more, you can tailor questions to specific groups of guests. For example, thereâs no need to ask reception-only attendees about brunch plans if theyâre not invited. This thoughtful approach helps you manage logistics smoothly while avoiding any potential missteps with friends or family.

#### Wedding Invitation Etiquette Tips

#### Address Invitations Properly

\- Include full names and titles on the outer envelope.

\- List plus-ones and children on the inner envelope (if using one).

#### Understand Who Receives an Invitation

\- Anyone who received a save-the-date should also get an invitation.

\- Send one invitation per household, unless adults (18+) live at home, in which case they should receive separate invites.

#### Include a Self-Addressed, Stamped Envelope for RSVPs

\- Add a self-addressed envelope with a postage stamp for mailed RSVPs.

\- Alternatively, collect RSVPs digitally via your Joy wedding website.

#### Set an RSVP Deadline

\- Include a clear RSVP deadline (usually 2-4 weeks before the wedding).

\- Allow extra time for late RSVPs and follow up after the grace period.
