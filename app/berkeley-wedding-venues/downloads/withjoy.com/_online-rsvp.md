## Groups and Plus One Controls

## Prepped for Plus Ones.

Manage who gets a plus one (and who doesn't) for stress-free RSVPs.

### Never wonder who your guests are bringing.

Want to know exactly who's attending to prep your place cards? Allow guests to enter their plus one's name when RSVPing and it will update in your guest list.

## Unlock Plus Ones for Larger Venues and Families

## Some weddings are largeâlike, really, really large. Unlock everyoneâs plus ones at once, so your guests can bring more family and friends.

## Go beyond attendance questions.

Create custom RSVP questions to ask your guests about their meal selections, travel plans, and anything else.

Catering is no longer just âchicken or steak?â Weâve made it easy to get as detailed as you want, from allergies to appetizers, desserts to drinks.

### Guest Accommodations

### Know who is staying where, so you can better prepare.

Plan hotel blocks better. Ask your guests whether they have a place to stay and whatever else theyâll need to attend your ceremony.

## Still have questions?

I am mailing physical RSVPs, but want to collect responses digitally. Do you support that?

Absolutely. Include the link to your wedding website on your printed wedding RSVP card and configure Joy's guest list to allow any guest to add their own plus ones when they RSVP online.

Do you have to send physical RSVP cards with wedding invitations?

Giving guests the option to RSVP online or via paper can be a nice gesture. However, more and more couples are choosing to include online RSVP instructions on their wedding invitations instead of sending RSVP cards. Which option is right for you? Weâd say it definitely depends on your specific guest list and how comfortable your most of your invitees will be with sending their response electronically.

How is Joyâs invites and online wedding RSVP system better?

Our invites and RSVPs are connected straight to your guest list, meaning when your guests respond their answers will appear right where you need them. No more manually inputting everyoneâs responses; we do the dirty work for you. Joy's one-of-a kind system also allows you to collect RSVPs to multiple wedding events such as your wedding reception, brunch, or rehearsal dinner.

What does Joy cost?

Joy wedding websites, planning tools, and registry are free. Online Save the Dates and invitations have hundreds of free designs, as well as premium paid designs.

Do you have a support team we can reach out to if we have questions?

Absolutely! Our amazing support team works hard around the clock, every day of the week, including weekends, to make sure that your questions are answered. You can send us an email at [support@withjoy.com](mailto:support@withjoy.com).
