Last Updated on April 8, 2024 by [Joy Editors](https://withjoy.com)

One of the most fun aspects of wedding planning is creating your wedding website. From picking your [theme](https://withjoy.com/designs), fonts, colors and photos to telling your love story and sharing your wedding details, the possibilities are endless. Building a beautiful [wedding website](https://withjoy.com/wedding-website/) is an opportunity to showcase your style and express your creativity with loved ones. 

You can match your wedding website to your wedding [invitations](https://withjoy.com/wedding-invitations/), pick a theme that reflects your wedding location or venue, or select the theme that feels the most “you.” Your wedding website reflects your personality and sets the tone for your wedding day.

We’re constantly amazed by the creativity we see from Joy couples in their wedding websites. Here are some real Joy wedding website examples to serve as inspiration as you create your own.

## **Wedding Website Examples That Convey Your Style**

Whether your style is classic or modern, bold or pastel, floral or minimal, convey your taste and your wedding style with the theme of your website.

### **1\. Metallic Dipped Gold**

![Metallic dipped gold wedding website examples](https://withjoy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/metallic-dipped-gold_aloha-1024x640.jpg)![Metallic dipped gold wedding website examples](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201024%20640%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Nehir and Jonas’ elegant metallic dipped gold wedding website theme perfectly pairs with their romantic cover photo and its complementing rich jewel tones. This luxe template would be ideal for a black tie or more formal wedding — perhaps an occasion with a hint of glitz and glam.

### **2\. Bohemian Eucalyptus**

![Bohemian eucalyptus wedding website example](https://withjoy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bohemian-eucalyptus_aloha-1024x640.jpg)![Bohemian eucalyptus wedding website example](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201024%20640%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Milan and Ecrin’s love of botanicals and one another is beautifully on display with this bohemian eucalyptus wedding website theme. Soft, artful illustrations couple nicely with engagement photos capturing a sweet moment in the park. This light and airy greenery theme would be great for a springtime or garden wedding. 

### **3\. Garden Window**

![Garden window wedding website example](https://withjoy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/garden-window_aloha-1024x640.jpg)![Garden window wedding website example](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201024%20640%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Sita and Yahli created an enchanting experience on their wedding website by complementing elegant graphics with a magical photo showing off their love. This theme is wonderful for anyone hosting a garden or destination wedding set in a dreamy outdoor setting. 

### **4\. Botanical Geo**

![Botanical geo wedding website example](https://withjoy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/botanical-geo_aloha-1024x640.jpg)![Botanical geo wedding website example](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201024%20640%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Jasmine and Riko chose a modern botanical website theme that boasts understated elegance with watercolor illustrations and a romantic fairy tale-like photo. The simple yet captivating color palette would be a match made in heaven for a more contemporary, minimalist celebration — perhaps a white tie affair or even a winter wedding.

### **5\. Garden Estate**

![Garden Estate wedding website example](https://withjoy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/garden_estate_ii_aloha-1024x640.jpg)![Garden Estate wedding website example](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201024%20640%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Both playful and romantic, Aline and Thomas’ garden estate wedding website makes us swoon. If you’re an outdoorsy couple or thinking of hosting your wedding in an outdoor setting such as a garden or forest, this theme may be the one for you. 

### **6\. Love and Leaves**

![Love and Leaves wedding website example](https://withjoy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/love-and-leaves_aloha-1024x640.jpg)![Love and Leaves wedding website example](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201024%20640%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Jonathan and Yuuna’s wedding website is the epitome of garden whimsy. From the sweet arched leaf graphics to the ethereal cover photo set in a meadow, it’s safe to say we’re in love. This type of website template would pair perfectly with an outdoor or unique destination wedding.

## **Wedding Website Examples That Show Your Artistic Side**

While we always love to see couples’ engagement photos, we also love when couples use unique, personal artwork on their wedding websites, such as these examples. 

### ****7\. Playful Drawings****

![artistic wedding website example with drawings](https://withjoy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Artistic-James-and-Anne-Lise-1024x508.jpg)![artistic wedding website example with drawings](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201024%20508%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

James and Anne-Lise’s playful custom drawings set a fun tone for their wedding weekend. These illustrations could also creatively tie into the theme of your wedding (and into your stationery and RSVPs).

### **8\. Realistic Watercolor Portrait**

![artistic wedding website with travel theme](https://withjoy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Artistic-Elmor-and-Elaine-1024x566.jpg)![artistic wedding website with travel theme](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201024%20566%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Elmor and Elaine’s portrait was created for them by their close friend, the artist David Correia, and shows their adventurous spirit and love for travel. Get creative and dream up a scene that best depicts you and your partner’s personality.

### **9\. Saturated Photography**

![](https://withjoy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Artistic-Cheah-and-Chan-1024x481.jpg)![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201024%20481%22%3E%3C/svg%3E) _Photography credit:_[_Zhuo Ya Photography_](https://www.zhuo-ya.com/)

Cheah and Chan’s enhanced wedding website photography with saturated colors is nothing short of dreamy. Use a unique photo effect to make your website really pop — we promise, it will be one to remember.

### **10\. Playful Illustrations**

![wedding website example with portraits](https://withjoy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Artistic-Renee-and-Bryan-1024x506.jpg)![wedding website example with portraits](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201024%20506%22%3E%3C/svg%3E) _Artist credit:_[_ThePaperWoodland_](https://www.etsy.com/ca/shop/ThePaperWoodland?ref=simple-shop-header-name&listing_id=263967265)

Renee and Bryan used playful portraits of themselves in lieu of photography. Consider commissioning your own unique drawing in your favorite style to add in some character to your wedding website.

## **Wedding Website Examples That Tell Your Love Story**

These couples used their wedding website to share their love stories with their guests, melting our hearts one webpage at a time.

### **11\. Proposal Video**

![wedding website proposal video example](https://withjoy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Love-story-Eilish-and-James-1024x509.jpg)![wedding website proposal video example](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201024%20509%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Eilish and James used their website welcome page to share their proposal video. Let guests join you for your entire wedding journey, from “yes” to “I do.”

### **12\. Couples Q &A**

![wedding website our story example](https://withjoy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Love-story-Courtney-and-Jesse-1024x505.jpg)![wedding website our story example](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201024%20505%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Though their picture is worth a thousand words on its own, Courtney and Jesse customized their “Our Story” website page to reflect their personalities. A Q&A format makes it easy to lean into your storytelling abilities and share a bit about you as a couple for a personal touch.

## **Wedding Website Examples That** **Showcase Your Destination**

Whether you’re having a destination wedding or want to convey the vibe of your wedding location or venue, a theme that reflects your wedding locale sets the tone for your event.

### **13\. Destination Photography**

![destination wedding website example](https://withjoy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Destination-Jaylyn-and-Zachary-1024x504.jpg)![destination wedding website example](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201024%20504%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Jaylyn and Zachary’s mountain website theme and image selection are a perfect fit for their Canada wedding. Plus, their photography choice shows off Jaylyn’s stunning ring! Display a memorable photo of you and your partner at the destination of your wedding to amp up the excitement.

### **14\. Destination Wedding Itineraries**

![wedding website creative use of wedding schedule](https://withjoy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Creative-page-use-Vanessa-and-Joe-1024x502.jpg)![wedding website creative use of wedding schedule](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201024%20502%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Vanessa and Joe removed everything but the schedule and travel sections of their wedding website, fitting for their Florida destination adventure. The detailed schedule page creates a full trip itinerary for their guests, to ensure their loved ones had an amazing trip. They also featured a countdown on their wedding website, generating excitement and anticipation for their big day. For your own wedding website, think about including an itinerary or fun things to do to guide your guests through your destination.

### **15\. Frame Your Venue**

![wedding website example - frame for photo](https://withjoy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Frame-your-photo-Christine-and-Connor-1024x511.jpg)![wedding website example - frame for photo](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201024%20511%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Christine and Connor made their stunning engagement photo pop with a leafy frame. Let your photo do the talking with a website theme that focuses on your portrait. This is the perfect place to showcase your all-time favorite photo from your engagement shoot or personal archives — bonus points if it’s where you also plan to say “I do.”

## **Wedding Website Examples That** Make it Your Own

Did you know you can customize the names of your wedding website pages and get as detailed as you want to suit your wedding needs? These couples personalized their sites to fit the nature of their celebrations.

### **16\. Monogram It**

![wedding website example with custom monogram](https://withjoy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Monogram-It-Hayden-and-Troy-1024x507.jpg)![wedding website example with custom monogram](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201024%20507%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

We love a good monogram. Hayden and Troy’s monogram wedding crest is the perfect addition to their wedding website. You can get extra creative, even on a free wedding website, with personalization and customization in CSS.

### **17\. Let Your Personality Shine**

![wedding website example with personality](https://withjoy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Personality-William-and-Rachel-1024x500.jpg)![wedding website example with personality](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201024%20500%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

William and Rachel’s playful personalities shine through in their wedding website imagery. Be as silly, loud and creative as you want in your photo and bios — it’s _your_ wedding website.

### **18\. Incorporate a Video Welcome**

Tiff and Nick created a video message to their guests, giving their wedding website an even more personal touch. This is a great way to further engage with your loved ones and get them even more excited to celebrate your big day.

### **19\. Personalized Welcome**

![wedding website about us example](https://withjoy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Love-story-Justina-and-Martin-1024x508.jpg)![wedding website about us example](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201024%20508%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Justina and Martin shared the rundown of their relationship in their welcome message. You can do this with a short message if video isn’t your thing. Love at first website glance!

### **20\. Share a Meaningful Quote**

![wedding website quote example](https://withjoy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Quote-Samuel-and-Eshan-1024x505.jpg)![wedding website quote example](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201024%20505%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Samuel and Eshan used their welcome greeting to share a meaningful quote with their guests. It can be religious, poetic or drawn from pop culture — just share your favorite words with guests for the meaningful day.

### **21\. Show Off Your Rings**

![wedding website example with wedding rings](https://withjoy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Rings-Naomi-and-Jonathan-1024x504.jpg)![wedding website example with wedding rings](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201024%20504%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Naomi and Jonathan showed off their custom wedding rings on the welcome page of their wedding website. The classic and romantic ring close-up photograph is always a crowd pleaser — especially if your jewelry is unique!

### **22\. RSVP Only**

![wedding website for rsvp only](https://withjoy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Creative-page-use-Amberly-and-Gregory-1024x556.jpg)![wedding website for rsvp only](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201024%20556%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Amberly and Gregory only used their wedding website to collect RSVPs. Given Joy’s comprehensive [RSVP feature](https://withjoy.com/wedding-invitations/), we don’t blame them! You can keep your wedding website as simple as you like — just as long as it gets the job done!

  * Use Joy’s [guest list manager](https://withjoy.com/guest-list/), a helpful tool that lets you organize your guest list and any sub-lists for related wedding events like your rehearsal dinner. 
  * Send free, online [save the dates](https://withjoy.com/save-the-date/), invitations and messages to all your guests or certain groups of guests. You can also order printed versions of your wedding stationery through Joy’s print partners.
  * Track responses with Joy’s [RSVP feature](https://withjoy.com/wedding-invitations/), which helps you collect RSVPs for all of your wedding events, allows you to customize your questions and ask follow up questions such as meal selection, and updates responses within your guest list in real time.
