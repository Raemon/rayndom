### Can I customize my wedding site for particular guests, for example my wedding party or rehearsal dinner guests?

Yes, you can edit your schedule visibility so only particular wedding events and their details are shown to only specific guests. You can also add password protection to all sections of your site so only guests can see your wedding info.

### Can I use my website in stages? Meaning, can I have some information live and not others?

You can absolutely update your website at any time. If you have any information that has yet to be resolved, feel free to put a TBD or remove it for the time being. Your guests will not be updated if you make changes automatically, but you can send out an email from our platform to let them know.

Yes, you can purchase a domain name directly from Joy (or use a domain you already have) and set it up to forward to your withjoy.com URL when someone visits that domain.

### Can I use the website without the app?

You can use Joy to create your wedding website and not share the download links to install your wedding app. However, if you want your guests to be able to upload photos to your website, they will need the app.

### What do I need to open a Joy account?

You can create a Joy account using either your email or Facebook.

### What should be on a wedding website?

The basic function of a wedding website is to communicate all the important details your guests need to know about your big day, including your wedding date, location, dress codes, and gift registries.

### When I share my website with someone, what can they see?

### Can I customize the pages that appear on my website?

Yes! Joy allows you to create custom wedding website pages, or even adapt your site for other important events such as anniversaries, birthday parties, and baby showers.

Planning a wedding involves juggling multiple tasks and managing countless details â a daunting prospect for even the most organized couples. Fortunately, Joyâs Wedding Websites has an arsenal of smart features to streamline your planning process. Personalized schedules allow you to map out every aspect of your wedding events, from the rehearsal dinner to the post-wedding brunch, and customize access for your guests. Tired of answering the same questions repeatedly? Say hello to the guest Q&A feature, where you can create a comprehensive FAQ section covering everything from attire suggestions to transportation details.   
  
**Facilitating Guest Travel**   
  
Your wedding day is a celebration shared with cherished friends and family, many of whom may be traveling from afar to join you. Joyâs Wedding Websites makes it effortless to provide them with essential travel information, ensuring a seamless and stress-free experience. From hotel recommendations to transit schedules, guests can access all the details they need to plan their trip directly from your website.

Managing your guest list can be a logistical nightmare, but Joyâs Free Wedding Websites simplifies the process with intuitive guest management tools. The connected guest list feature allows you to collect addresses seamlessly, import guest lists, send messages, and track RSVPs.  
  
Group your guests, assign plus ones and organize them with tags to ensure everyone is accounted for. With powerful event privacy settings, you can control who sees what on your website, safeguarding your privacy while keeping your guests informed.   
  
**Capturing Memories to Last a Lifetime**   
  
Your wedding day is more than just a ceremony â a celebration of love shared with the people who matter most to you. Joyâs Wedding Websites helps you capture and share those precious moments with your guests, ensuring your special day is in their memories forever.  
  
From sharing your unique love story to introducing your wedding party with personalized bios, you can infuse your website with the joy and excitement of your journey together. Matching stationery, including Save the Dates and invitations, available as eCards or prints, can create a cohesive and coordinated experience for your guests.   
  
**Start with the essentials.**   
  
Building a perfect wedding website online is crucial for todayâs couples, offering a streamlined platform to communicate essential details and enhance the overall guest experience. Start by prioritizing informing and delighting your guests through a thoughtful approach to content organization.  
  
Begin with the basics, ensuring that crucial information such as your name, wedding date, location, and key event timings are prominently featured. Providing a clear event timeline, including pre-ceremony gatherings and post-wedding festivities, you keep guests informed and help them plan their attendance effectively. Utilize customizable scheduling features to maintain privacy for exclusive events like rehearsal dinners. Address common queries preemptively with an FAQ page, covering topics from parking to dress code, to ease guest concerns and streamline communication.  
  
Delight your guests by going beyond mere information dissemination. Introduce your wedding party with personal details and photos to foster familiarity among guests. Maintain a cohesive theme across all aspects of your wedding, from invitations to website design, to create a unified and memorable experience. Enhance visual appeal with professional photography, capturing key moments and emotions to engage your audience. While including a registry page, emphasize gratitude over gifts, underscoring the importance of their presence.  
  
Lastly, consider the extra touches that elevate your website from functional to exceptional. Set clear guidelines for social media usage and photography to respect the sanctity of certain moments. Recommend local activities to extend guest enjoyment and make their visit truly memorable. Incorporate multimedia elements such as videos to share your love story and engagement journey, adding depth to your websiteâs narrative. Share a brief yet heartfelt account of your meeting to add a personal touch. Lastly, acknowledge the contributions of vendors who bring your wedding vision to life, fostering a sense of community and appreciation.
