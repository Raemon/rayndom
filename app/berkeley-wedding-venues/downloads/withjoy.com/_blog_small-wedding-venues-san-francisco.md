Weddings are beautiful at any size, and small weddings are no exception. At a small wedding, you get to spend time more time with your guests, save some money, and plan activities that just wouldn’t work with a larger group. But if you’re planning a wedding of fewer than 100 guests, some of the most popular wedding venues might not be the right fit. Instead, choose a venue specifically suited for smaller groups, and truly provide that intimate feel. From historic buildings to cruise ships, we’ve gathered up some of the best small wedding venues in San Francisco.

## [Haas-Lilienthal House](https://www.haas-lilienthalhouse.org/rates-and-floorplans)

![haas lilienthal house wedding](https://rehearsaluploads.withjoy.com/uploads/uploads/haas-lilienthal.jpg)![haas lilienthal house wedding](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)[www.haas-lilienthalhouse.org](https://www.haas-lilienthalhouse.org)

Built in 1886 in classic Queen Anne style, the Haas-Lilienthal House is the perfect place for a classic and intimate San Franciscan wedding. Now the headquarters for San Francisco Heritage, the museum area is also open for wedding rentals. Your rental includes the ballroom and the first floor of the home. Complete with a fireplace and grand piano, this Victorian dream house will not disappoint.

**Capacity:** 60 seated for the first floor. 100 for the ballroom.

**Typical Cost:** $3,350 – $3,850 for ceremony and reception.

**Bonus:** In 2012, the house was recognized as one of 34 National Treasures in the U.S.

Chic decor and plants galore set this non-traditional venue apart. A cafe by day, Stable transforms into a private venue by night.

**Capacity:** 80 seated guests; 100 standing.

**Typical Cost:** $5,000 – $5,500
