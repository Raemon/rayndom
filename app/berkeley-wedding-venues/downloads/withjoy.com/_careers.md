## âSomething Iâm proud of doing here at Joy is building a product based on _empathy_.   
  
We want to foster a great workplace culture where people donât feel as if theyâre just clocking into work. People come in to engage with each other, to share ideas, to exchange conversation, and itâs really _meaningful_ work that we do together.â

Kevin Tran, Frontend Software Engineer

## âThe thing I like most about Joy is the _people_ , without an absolute doubt.   
  
There is a connectedness, a heart, and engagement that goes on top of the usual passion of problem-solving. Thereâs this sense of connection and deeper value, and it comes from the top down.â

Dan Foley, Director of Engineering

### How We Work

## Nothing great is made alone.

### Design isnât just a team, it is a process weâre all a part of. 

Joy is a design-driven product. That means that the entire team values and participates in an open and collaborative design process, from the start of a feature all the way through to testing and release. Because getting to the best solution takes everyone working together.

### We work in pods, forming close relationships across disciplines and strengths.

Pods at Joy are like sports teams. They have their own ways of working and cultures, and theyâre always evolving and iterating on their products and their process. We encourage experimentation and evolution because the best way of working is always a moving target.

Everyone collaborates so well together. All ideas are heard, talked about, and sometimes even executed. Itâs a very _collaborative_ experience.â
