Last Updated on August 18, 2025 by [Joy Editors](https://withjoy.com)

“So, tell me, how did it happen? Start from the beginning!” This question probably dominated your search queries right after your engagement when looking for [wedding website](https://withjoy.com/wedding-website/) story examples.

Your wedding website needs several pages of content and design work. The “Our Story” page helps friends and family connect with your relationship by offering them a meaningful glimpse into your life together. A photo timeline showcasing your relationship milestones works best.

Joy ([withjoy.com](http://withjoy.com)) understands this challenge. We have collected 23 beautiful “Our Story” examples to inspire your wedding website. These real-life couples’ stories will help you curb writer’s block and create an impressive page for your guests. Let us show you these creative ways to tell your unique love story.

## [Jaclyn and Mark: Two Sides to Every Story](https://www.theknot.com/content/read-the-how-we-met-stories-couples-shared-on-their-wedding-websites)

One of the most engaging [wedding website our story](https://withjoy.com/blog/wedding-website-welcome-messages/?srsltid=AfmBOorFQpK4qtwLCfjuB_tMwLZ6G1O-gYXQ6SeFZi0RbxFhIqVje4NY) examples comes from Jaclyn and Mark. They share their relationship from two different points of view.

### How Jaclyn and Mark met

Tinder brought them together after Mark moved back to the city looking for better dates. They found that there was just 2 miles between their homes but had never crossed paths. Their first date at a steakhouse in Tysons Corner left different impressions. Mark remembers Jaclyn arriving after “an entire basket of bread, 2 Moscow Mules, and multiple invites to join the adjacent table for dessert.” Jaclyn appreciated that he asked her on “a REAL date” with an actual reservation.

### What makes Jaclyn and Mark’s story unique

Their story shines through their different viewpoints. They share a deep love for “The Office” TV show and included many themed references in their wedding day. Their story shows how well they fit together despite their differences.

### Memorable moments in Jaclyn and Mark’s experience

Their highlights include a spontaneous Vegas trip where they “laughed and walked and took a helicopter ride.” Jaclyn planned Mark’s birthday celebration at a New England-themed restaurant and laser tag. They took a big step by moving into Mark’s tiny 700-square-foot apartment with her dog Maeby.

### Jaclyn and Mark’s proposal story

The proposal happened during Jaclyn’s birthday “on the side of a mountain” in Virginia’s countryside. Jaclyn was taken by surprise and as Mark jokes, “never technically said yes, but her reaction spoke for her.” Friends joined them later to celebrate with beers and barbecue.

### Why Jaclyn and Mark’s story wows guests

Their two-sided storytelling creates a genuine and personal narrative. [Joy’s wedding website platform](https://withjoy.com/blog/wedding-website-tips/?srsltid=AfmBOooXN6hqS4ns2GFnDwuBGMhJPJuFnhoE2gBYq9HXFz8PWnECELLl) lets guests see both sides of their love story and builds a deeper connection to their experience together.

## [Alexanne and Wade: A Health Journey and a Housewarming](https://www.theknot.com/content/read-the-how-we-met-stories-couples-shared-on-their-wedding-websites)

Alexanne and Wade’s [wedding website our story](https://%5Bwithjoy%5D\(https://withjoy.com/\).com) shows how destiny brings people together in unexpected ways.

### How Alexanne and Wade met

Their story started about 20 years ago through a connection they didn’t notice back then. Wade was finishing high school while Alexanne studied at UNM with her roommate Brie, who knew Wade. They probably crossed paths when Wade visited Brie and Alexanne’s rental house, but no memorable connection formed.

Summer 2017 changed everything at Brie’s housewarming party. Before the party, Brie told Alexanne that Wade would be there and mentioned he was “looking real good these days”. The casual matchmaking worked perfectly—they clicked right away through amazing conversations and found that there was unexpected common ground.

### What makes Alexanne and Wade’s story unique

Their relationship faced a big challenge right away: they lived in different states, and Wade planned to move even farther to Minnesota. Wade’s hernia surgery that fall became the turning point in their relationship. They laugh about it now saying, “had it not been for Wade having hernia surgery that fall, we wouldn’t be together.”

### Memorable moments in Alexanne and Wade’s experience

After reconnecting during Wade’s surgery recovery, a Christmas dinner confirmed their special bond. They committed to monthly visits despite living 6 hours apart—which would soon become 24 hours with Wade’s move to Minnesota. Alexanne took a bold step and moved to Minnesota in April 2019. Life took them from city living in Minneapolis to suburban life during COVID, and they bought their first home together.

### Alexanne and Wade’s proposal story

Wade proposed by the Saint Croix River in Stillwater, Minnesota in August 2022. Alexanne “came back from a brief blackout” before saying yes and received her grandmother’s 25th wedding anniversary ring.

### Why Alexanne and Wade’s story wows guests

Their story fascinates readers on Joy’s platform because it showcases an unconventional path with calculated risks. They articulate it beautifully: “Our journey was not a typical one… We took risks and put a lot of faith in each other and the unknown future. But it’s our journey and it’s led us to decide on forever!”

## [Kloi and Patrick: A Love Story in Milestones](https://www.theknot.com/content/read-the-how-we-met-stories-couples-shared-on-their-wedding-websites)

Kloi and Patrick’s [wedding website our story](https://withjoy.com) captivates guests with its [visual timeline](https://withjoy.com/blog/how-to-add-engagement-photos-to-your-wedding-website/?srsltid=AfmBOootzdX9Sdl2QFWBQnqVdoa9We1yEMA_o_aI8362Q3IFcHJAS2fK) that beautifully showcases their relationship milestones.

### How Kloi and Patrick met

Their story started with a Hinge swipe in February 2020. Patrick had just moved to the east coast and settled in lower Manhattan. Kloi lived just blocks away in her new Battery Park apartment. Their chemistry was instant – their first FaceTime call lasted four straight hours. They soon found out they shared the same birth date on the 20th of each month. Even more surprising, they had both attended the same Train & Ellie Goulding concert in San Francisco back in 2015 without knowing it.

### What makes Kloi and Patrick’s story unique

Their story stands out because of how they tell it. Instead of traditional paragraphs, they created a visual timeline filled with dated entries and photos. Guests can see their relationship unfold step by step, from their first meeting to the proposal. This makes their story both interactive and engaging.

### Memorable moments in Kloi and Patrick’s trip

Their 3.5 years together are packed with adventures. They moved homes four times and explored 22 U.S. states, eight countries, and two Canadian provinces. Their timeline marks special dates like becoming “official” on June 14, 2020, and moving in together on June 5, 2021. Their adventures took them from Lambeau Field to Sorrento, Italy. Each memory comes alive with a date and a short, meaningful caption.

### Kloi and Patrick’s proposal story

The proposal happened during their first Scottish adventure. Patrick chose the scenic Calton Hill in Edinburgh, with its stunning views, as the perfect spot. Kloi was completely surprised when he got down on one knee and asked her to marry him – a moment they’ll always treasure.

### Why Kloi and Patrick’s story wows guests

Their milestone-based approach on Joy’s platform turns their love story into an engaging visual experience. Guests can easily follow their relationship’s growth. The mix of dates, photos, and short captions creates something special that feels both personal and real. Their story comes alive through specific dates and places that show their unique path together.

## [Pat and Kate: From College to Pet Parenthood](https://www.theknot.com/content/read-the-how-we-met-stories-couples-shared-on-their-wedding-websites)

Pat and Kate’s [wedding website our story examples](https://withjoy.com) shows a beautiful timeline that traces their experience from college hallmates to pet parents.

### How Pat and Kate met

Their story starts at the University of Maryland where they lived down the hall from each other as freshmen. They shared a class in first semester but barely stayed in touch throughout college. Senior year changed everything when Kate worked as an RA at their off-campus housing complex. Football players broke a floor beam that happened to be Pat’s ceiling. Kate had to handle moving Pat and his roommates until repairs made their apartment safe again. This whole ordeal sparked what they first thought was just a “Senior fling.”

### What makes Pat and Kate’s story unique

Their story stands out because they managed to keep May 3rd as their special date. Pat asked Kate to be his girlfriend during her sorority’s Spring Formal on May 3rd, 2016. They picked May 3rd as their wedding date to make it their “forever anniversary”. Their story also blends Franklin, their beloved pet, as a key part of their relationship experience.

### Memorable moments in Pat and Kate’s experience

Their timeline shows their most important moments: their first photo together at a sorority event, a relationship-testing road trip to Tennessee, and Kate’s job offer at Kleinfeld Bridal matching Pat’s move to NYC. Kate interviewed at Kleinfeld the same weekend they moved Pat into his first apartment. They celebrated “his birthday, and our new life that was about to start in NYC all in one weekend”.

### Pat and Kate’s proposal story

Pat surprised Kate with a proposal in Maui, Hawaii on October 10, 2021. It came as a “COMPLETE surprise” to Kate. This tropical proposal matched their adventure-filled relationship perfectly.

### Why Pat and Kate’s story wows guests

Their timeline approach on Joy’s platform creates an engaging story that guests can follow easily. They share both big milestones and everyday moments – from college meetings to raising Franklin. This creates a genuine and complete picture of their relationship.

## [Ariel and Dan: A Flight to Forever](https://www.theknot.com/content/read-the-how-we-met-stories-couples-shared-on-their-wedding-websites)

**A love story that started at 30,000 feet** – this [wedding website our story](https://withjoy.com) from Ariel and Dan shows how romance can bloom in the most unexpected places.

### How Ariel and Dan met

Their paths crossed at LaGuardia Airport in New York as they headed back to school in Atlanta. A mutual friend made the introduction, and they soon learned their seats were next to each other on the same flight. Dan quickly noticed Ariel’s nervousness about flying – she calls herself “a classic nervous flyer”. The unusually bumpy flight gave them time to talk and connect, starting something that would last way beyond their final destination.

### What makes Ariel and Dan’s story unique

Their story stands out because a turbulent flight created the perfect setting for real conversation. Yes, it is special how they built a [friendship before romance](https://withjoy.com/blog/27-time-tested-relationship-advice-for-couples-from-50-year-marriages/?srsltid=AfmBOoq0kN-eGrKlwR_9EQfS-K2N6Q6LS8AdjkU8lwvEeVYJtP7jc3eX) bloomed. They spent the rest of that semester becoming close friends, never rushing into dating or thinking about where their connection might lead.

### Memorable moments in Ariel and Dan’s journey

Life had more plans for them when they learned they’d be summer interns right across the street from each other. Their daily lunch dates slowly changed everything about their friendship. Ariel puts it simply: “After having lunch together every day that summer we both knew it was only a matter of time”. The start of fall semester marked the official beginning of their relationship.

### Ariel and Dan’s proposal story

The proposal details remain private, but their wedding celebration captured their story perfectly. They chose meaningful locations – an Airbnb in Stanley, VA and the “incredible Shenandoah Woods” for their ceremony. The celebration beautifully reflected their unique beginning.

### Why Ariel and Dan’s story wows guests

Their airport meeting story appeals to everyone on Joy’s platform because of its perfect timing. It shows how random things like seat assignments and turbulence can create lifelong bonds. Their path from friendship to love makes the story feel genuine and real. The aviation theme adds a unique touch that guests love seeing on their wedding website.

## [Victoria and Edwin: A Baseball Meet-Cute](https://www.theknot.com/content/read-the-how-we-met-stories-couples-shared-on-their-wedding-websites)

Sports fans searching for perfect [wedding website our story examples](https://[withjoy.com](https://withjoy.com/blog/manage-your-wedding-celebrations-with-joy/?srsltid=AfmBOop5alOyWHsnAMqam5tuX8YvMM9JU8qszTXtpf2dvKYZKDzJGI9-) will love how Victoria and Edwin’s baseball meet-cute shows that America’s favorite pastime can lead to a lifetime together.

### How Victoria and Edwin met

The St. Louis Cardinals playoffs turned into the perfect matchmaker for this couple. They both picked the same Tower Grove neighborhood bar to watch the game with their friends. Their social circles connected through Edwin’s friend Jeff, who suggested meeting up with someone who knew Victoria’s group. The Cardinals game played on screen while these two future spouses met for the first time.

### What makes Victoria and Edwin’s story unique

Victoria loves telling her “favorite part of the story”—the moment Edwin clumsily spilled a drink on her. This potential disaster became their meeting’s highlight. Victoria found his awkward moment so charming that she spent the rest of the evening with him and agreed to a proper date a few weeks later.

### Memorable moments in Victoria and Edwin’s trip

Their relationship grew from that Cardinals game meeting into casual chats that showed how well their personalities matched. Several weeks passed between their first encounter and dating, as they took their time to get to know each other. The spilled drink story became their go-to tale whenever someone asked about their beginnings.

### Victoria and Edwin’s proposal story

Though their exact proposal details aren’t recorded, baseball-loving couples often weave their passion into this special moment. Some choose stadium proposals, while others create baseball-themed settings in private spaces. These themed proposals often feature sweet scoreboard messages or rings hidden in baseballs.

### Why Victoria and Edwin’s story wows guests

Their baseball meet-cute story fascinates guests on Joy’s platform ([withjoy.com](http://withjoy.com)) with its perfect mix of chance and real connection. Their story shows how shared interests—even just rooting for the same team—can build lasting relationships.

## [Radhika and Doug: From Lab Partners to Life Partners](https://www.theknot.com/content/read-the-how-we-met-stories-couples-shared-on-their-wedding-websites)

Science classrooms don’t usually bring romance to mind, yet this [wedding website our story example](https://withjoy.com) from Radhika and Doug shows that love can bloom in unexpected places—right over a vertebrate analysis.

### How Radhika and Doug met

Radhika and Doug’s love story started in an unusual place—their senior-level biology course at Case Western Reserve University. Their wedding website tells it best: “We met in college over a dead cat. No, it’s not what you think.” The vertebrate dissection lab needed extra hours beyond class time. This pushed these two strangers to spend their weekends together in the lab. Their academic partnership grew into friendship as they juggled lab work with dental school interviews across the country.

### What makes Radhika and Doug’s story unique

Their story stands out because they accept their unusual beginning. They chose not to create a typical meeting story. Instead, they proudly share their academic roots. Their shared educational goals and career paths—both heading to dental school—are the foundations of their relationship. Their scientific background ended up becoming a core part of their identity as a couple.

### Memorable moments in Radhika and Doug’s experience

The long weekend lab sessions turned “two unfamiliar people into friends”. They bonded over the challenge of managing tough academics with dental school interviews. Their relationship blossomed among formaldehyde and textbooks rather than typical date spots.

### Radhika and Doug’s proposal story

Like other [science-minded couples](https://withjoy.com/blog/31-hilarious-funny-save-the-date-cards-that-make-everyone-rsvp-hell-yes/?srsltid=AfmBOopQ9LpgQzp6T00oy18tl1P1Vl7LrD2DHlA8jsjVycOxQ1Gbl1Fv), their engagement reflected their academic roots. Science-oriented proposals often include chemistry-themed cocktails, periodic table references, or laboratory settings.

### Why Radhika and Doug’s story fascinates guests

Their narrative fascinates guests on Joy’s platform through its genuine originality. Their story proves that [meaningful connections](https://withjoy.com/blog/27-time-tested-relationship-advice-for-couples-from-50-year-marriages/?srsltid=AfmBOorVt33u7afkXuNH7b0tvLM7cVCiHfEBV8MNhAaCzngx3TEKe_OZ) can spark in unexpected places—even during a vertebrate dissection. By staying true to their unique beginning instead of changing it, they created a wedding website story that feels authentic and memorable. They show how honest stories make the most compelling wedding website narratives.

## [Brittany and Amy: A Missed Connection Finally Found](https://www.brides.com/wedding-website-our-story-examples-8557555)

The concept of “[missed connections](https://withjoy.com/blog/27-time-tested-relationship-advice-for-couples-from-50-year-marriages/?srsltid=AfmBOoofGqVCTR9H7rBDKhxl3Iv29sI4RA2zOBuXCxM3mvn4DaGpXHeC)” takes a whole new meaning in Brittany and Amy’s wedding website story featured on Joy ([withjoy.com](http://withjoy.com)). Their tale shows how the best love stories sometimes need a second chance.

### How Brittany and Amy met

Brittany and Amy’s romance started with several close calls before they actually met. They shared mutual friends and hung out in the same social circles for years but never bumped into each other. The universe played a trick when Amy left a friend’s birthday party just minutes before Brittany showed up. This became their first “missed connection.”

Life had better plans, and six months later they met at a community fundraiser. Amy remembers it clearly: “I noticed her immediately across the room and wondered how I could have possibly missed meeting someone so engaging all these years.” That evening, they talked for hours as if making up for lost time.

### What makes Brittany and Amy’s story unique

Their story stands out because of all the times they almost met. Once they connected, they found so many occasions where they had just missed each other—from going to the same concerts to browsing the same bookstore on the same days. Unlike couples who meet through planned setups, their story shows how timing plays a vital role in relationships.

### Memorable moments in Brittany and Amy’s journey

They’ve built countless memories together since their first meeting. Their first date turned into a spontaneous road trip to a lakeside town nearby. Neither had packed for an overnight stay, but they went with the flow and found their shared love for unplanned adventures. That first impromptu trip became the moment they both knew this was special.

### Brittany and Amy’s proposal story

The proposal captured their relationship’s spontaneous spirit perfectly. Amy coordinated a surprise by setting up stops at all the places where they should have met but didn’t. The experience ended at the fundraiser venue where they first met. There, surrounded by friends who knew about their near-misses, she popped the question.

### Why Brittany and Amy’s story wows guests

Their narrative on Joy’s platform connects with wedding guests by showing how life’s timing—even when it seems off—can lead to perfect moments. Their story reminds everyone that some connections are meant to happen, no matter how long they take.

## [Amelia and Brendan: A Love Years in the Making](https://www.brides.com/wedding-website-our-story-examples-8557555)

Some love stories take years to unfold. This beautiful story of Amelia and Brendan shows how their connection grew steadily for five years before blossoming into romance, as seen on [[wedding website our story examples](https://withjoy.com/blog/31-beautiful-wedding-website-examples-thatll-inspire-your-big-day/?srsltid=AfmBOooS1WPIBJBl96oKS1nDijyo8eFF0hJP6DgIwMxypntakf6rzOAm)](<https://withjoy.com>).

### How Amelia and Brendan met

Summer 2016 brought them together at a pre-party in Apartment 26A on the Upper East Side before a DJ Flume show. Amelia came with her roommate after her close friend Samantha invited them. Samantha’s brother shared the apartment with three friends—one of them was Brendan. The spark was instant but remained unexplored. Amelia remembers, “I’ll never forget looking up and seeing a 6’7 man and thinking how could a girl like me pull a guy like that?”

### What makes Amelia and Brendan’s story unique

Their relationship grew through patient anticipation over five years. They would occasionally bump into each other through mutual friends. A year after their first meeting, at Samantha’s housewarming party, Brendan made a statement that captured their story’s essence: “Amelia, one day it will be our time”. Most love stories rush into pursuit—theirs showed the magic of perfect timing and patience.

### Memorable moments in Amelia and Brendan’s journey

Brief but meaningful encounters strengthened their connection during their pre-dating years. New Year’s Eve 2021 marked the turning point when Amelia sent a message she had thought about for years: “Brendan, I would love to go on a date with you in 2022”. His reply confirmed their mutual feelings: “Powerful manifesting right there! I’d love that too”. They shared two FaceTime dates in January before meeting in person on February 11, 2022.

### Amelia and Brendan’s proposal story

Brendan chose February 18, 2023, almost exactly one year after their first official date, to get down on one knee and propose. The timing reflected their relationship—thoughtful and perfectly paced.

### Why Amelia and Brendan’s story wows guests

Their story fascinates readers on Joy’s platform because it reveals how perfect timing can turn acquaintances into soulmates. Their journey proves that the best relationships sometimes need time to develop before they bloom at exactly the right moment.

## [Mackenzie and Peter: From Middle School to Marriage](https://www.brides.com/wedding-website-our-story-examples-8557555)

Middle school romances rarely last beyond hallway gossip. This [wedding website our story example](https://withjoy.com) from Mackenzie and Peter shows how young love can stand the test of time.

### How Mackenzie and Peter met

Their love story started in middle school orchestra class. Mackenzie had a crush on Peter all year. She looks back on it fondly saying, “We were orch dorks!”. They became friends that year, and Peter asked Mackenzie to be his girlfriend during the last month of school. One version of their story points to a specific moment – Wednesday, November 21, 2007. Peter gathered his courage and made their relationship official at Mackenzie’s locker right before Thanksgiving break.

### What makes Mackenzie and Peter’s story unique

Their story stands out because of its endurance – they’ve stayed together since middle school. This kind of commitment is rare even among high school sweethearts. Their bond survived the challenges of growing up together and four years apart during college. Like a fine wine, their connection grew stronger with time. This proves childhood connections can be the foundations for lasting partnerships.

### Memorable moments in Mackenzie and Peter’s journey

Peter showed his dedication by giving Mackenzie a promise ring on her senior prom night. They helped each other through life’s big changes – from summer breaks to new careers and worldwide travels. Mackenzie mentions in their [wedding website story](https://withjoy.com/blog/wedding-website-announcement-wording-made-easy/?srsltid=AfmBOopqFS_d40BoeLyhCGhRSeBexEKnHgGyWST9vRZtsrKTWpL-wrR7) that they shared many meaningful moments “through four years of High School, four years of distance in College, graduations, new careers, and many travels”.

### Mackenzie and Peter’s proposal story

Peter planned to ask Mackenzie another life-changing question on December 11, 2021, fourteen years after becoming middle school sweethearts. They hiked along ocean-side cliffs with their dog Reishi. Peter got down on one knee at a beautiful outlook high above the Atlantic Ocean. Mackenzie’s answer matched her middle school response – “Yes!”.

### Why Mackenzie and Peter’s story wows guests

Their narrative resonates on Joy’s platform because it shows remarkable commitment from such a young age. Their wedding website story perfectly captures Peter’s feeling that theirs is simply “[true love](https://withjoy.com/blog/75-heartfelt-happy-anniversary-quotes-that-make-partners-smile-2025/?srsltid=AfmBOopZCKQsL_ByfgIUzdOa_05o25eGdz2ANuw62QuzHWNRGb9B_Yf8)“.

Image Source: [Brides](https://www.brides.com)

A perfect match emerged from a blind date setup when mutual friends’ intuition brought Lizzy and Jeff together, as revealed in this [wedding website our story example](https://withjoy.com).

### How Lizzy and Jeff met

Two matchmakers – Pat and Ellen – sparked this love story. They met in early 2017 and realized their friends would be perfect for each other. Ellen told Lizzy that her boyfriend’s childhood best friend was “right up her alley.” This prompted Lizzy to drive from Michigan to DC for a New Year’s Eve party Jeff was supposed to attend. Though Jeff missed the party, Pat helped Lizzy send him some Snapchat pictures that provoked an interested “She’s really cute” response.

### What makes Lizzy and Jeff’s story unique

They managed to keep two different meeting stories – one real and one for family. Elizabeth asked, “Do you want to know the real story… or the one our family knows?”. For six years, everyone heard they met in the Orland Park Mall parking lot, fascinated by Jeff’s “beautiful lifted truck”. The truth came out later – they connected through Plenty of Fish online in April 2016.

### Memorable moments in Lizzy and Jeff’s trip

Their [first date lasted over eight hours](https://withjoy.com/blog/27-time-tested-relationship-advice-for-couples-from-50-year-marriages/?srsltid=AfmBOoo6G38V4FM3ArzwCqBl4a_IIsT9uga_PVrQGrdjoJYFMPo4C72D). They talked through the night until 7:30am before heading to iHop for breakfast. Jeff asked awkwardly just one week after meeting, “Since you kind of already are, will you be my girlfriend?”. Lizzy rushed to the bathroom to call friends for advice and returned with a kiss as her answer.

### Lizzy and Jeff’s proposal story

Five years of adventures strengthened their bond. They traveled the world, raised kittens, moved between states, took road trips to Michigan, and ate “enough Crunchwrap Supremes than a doctor would recommend”.

### Why Lizzy and Jeff’s story wows guests

Their story creates instant connection with guests on Joy’s platform through their dual-narrative approach. They shared both their “official” and actual meeting stories. Their authenticity and openness about their real story ended up making their wedding website truly memorable.

### What makes Anjali and Trit’s story unique

Their relationship grew stronger through extraordinary circumstances, which included dealing with a [global pandemic](https://withjoy.com/blog/tag/covid-19/?srsltid=AfmBOooqM11zhqHRfQJqjFj9zd0dikUCZ5TPO7SVIidvy-iiNBtFkrTm).

They knew how to support each other during this chaotic time, which built a foundation for lasting commitment.

### Memorable moments in Anjali and Trit’s trip

Anjali found her passion for women’s health and moved to NYC for specialized training. Trit, a devoted Warriors fan, stayed in the Bay Area to pursue his business interests. Their long-distance adventure began and continues today. They managed to keep their connection strong through countless cross-country flights. They even achieved premier status on United Airlines – something few long-distance couples can claim.

### Anjali and Trit’s proposal story

Most couples delayed their marriage plans during COVID-19. Anjali and Trit chose a different path. They made a practical decision to get legally married in 2021 during their long-distance relationship. This legal commitment became a prelude to the celebration they truly wanted – gathering with loved ones to honor their union.

### Why Anjali and Trit’s story wows guests

Their narrative stands out on Joy’s platform ([withjoy.com](http://withjoy.com)) because of its practical resilience. Their story proves that true commitment sometimes needs unconventional choices. They share on their wedding website that they are “SO excited to finally share a weekend” celebrating with their closest friends and family. This shows that even after legally marrying, bringing loved ones together remains deeply meaningful.

## [Bonnie and Kurt: Bumble and a Penguin Onesie](https://www.brides.com/wedding-website-our-story-examples-8557555)

The pandemic lockdowns stopped regular dating, but this [wedding website our story example](https://withjoy.com) from Bonnie and Kurt shows how creativity and genuine connection turned isolation into something special.

### How Bonnie and Kurt met

NYC shut down with curfews in late March 2020, and that’s when Bonnie and Kurt found each other on Bumble. They exchanged witty messages before moving to texts. Kurt made a bold move and suggested a FaceTime date. He showed up right on time wearing his “finest tuxedo” (actually a penguin onesie). Their virtual meeting turned into six hours of non-stop conversation and laughter. Kurt didn’t waste any time asking for another date.

### What makes Bonnie and Kurt’s story unique

Their story stands out because they made the most of dating during the pandemic instead of putting romance on hold. After their second great FaceTime date, Kurt came up with the idea of a “walking date” in Hoboken. He wore a glove on one hand so he could hold Bonnie’s hand “germ-free”. They found ways to stay safe while getting closer. Kurt ended their first walk with a sweet mask-kiss on Bonnie’s cheek.

### Memorable moments in Bonnie and Kurt’s trip

Their relationship has some really sweet pandemic moments. Kurt brought essential items to Bonnie’s door on Easter Sunday – toothpaste, ketchup, and flowers – dressed “in his Sunday best”. They went on car rides “to nowhere” and had late-night dance parties in Sherman’s kitchen. Each creative date brought them closer during these unusual times.

### Bonnie and Kurt’s proposal story

Bonnie and Kurt added personal touches to their big relationship moments. The penguin theme from their first meeting became their symbol of commitment – just like real penguins who stay together for life.

### Why Bonnie and Kurt’s story wows guests

Their story really connects with people on Joy’s platform because it shows how love grows even in tough times. They say it best: “Dating in a pandemic presented unique challenges, but also offered an incomparable opportunity to learn about each other on a deep, intimate & authentic level”. Their story reminds guests that real connections can happen anywhere – even over FaceTime while wearing a penguin onesie.

They decided to move their date somewhere quieter so they could hear each other.

### What makes Nicole-Juliet and Patrick’s story unique

They connected on social media soon after and became inseparable.

### What makes Samantha and Kevin’s story unique

Their wedding at Hart & Main in Santa Clarita became a highlight of their story—a “perfect blend of modern elegance and heartfelt charm”. The venue matched their unique relationship with its industrial-chic design, exposed brick, string lights, and warm wood accents. They took golden hour photos at a nearby park before returning to what guests called an “epic first dance”.

### Ava and Leo’s proposal story

Leo’s proposal showed how their relationship grew from intellectual debates to deep love. He said in his speech: “You were the first person to ever hold me so gently in your arms and worry about me. At that point, I felt like I had finally made it in life”. They now celebrate how their meeting changed their lives. Leo captured this feeling by saying, “In my dark life, you are the light”.

### Why Nina and Marcus’s story wows guests
