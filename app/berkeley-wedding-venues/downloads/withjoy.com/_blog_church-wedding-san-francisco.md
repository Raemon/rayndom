Last Updated on April 8, 2024 by [Joy Editors](https://withjoy.com)

San Francisco has more than its fair share of beautiful churches. If you aren’t already a member of a congregation in the city, however, finding the right church for your wedding isn’t always so straightforward. Many churches will only marry members or require that both you and your partner belong to their specific denomination. Luckily some of the most stunningly beautiful churches in the city allow outside couples to marry within their doors. And luckily for you, we’ve done the work of compiling a list of the best options out there! Though they may still have some faith-based requirements, all the venues listed here are LGBT friendly and can accommodate interdenominational and interfaith weddings. Here are some amazing (and affordable!) locations for your church wedding in San Francisco.

## [St. Mark’s Lutheran](https://www.stmarks-sf.org/weddings/)

![st marks lutheran san francisco](https://rehearsaluploads.withjoy.com/uploads/uploads/shannonjames_vcp-0230-1024x682.jpg)![st marks lutheran san francisco](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)Photo courtesy of St. Mark’s Lutheran San Francisco

The beautiful and light-filled sanctuary of St. Mark’s Lutheran makes it one of our favorite wedding venues in the city. Completed in 1895, the church thankfully survived the 1906 San Francisco earthquake with its charming red brick exterior intact. The stunning interior is spacious and also boasts great acoustics. St. Mark’s congregation has always had a tradition of openness, and all couples are welcome. The wedding package includes the services of a wedding coordinator and a pastor, as well as the church’s music director and organist. The church also offers options for reception venues, including St. Mark’s square beside the church as an outdoor venue.

**Capacity:** 442

**Typical cost:** $3000 for the wedding package

## [Swedenborgian Church of San Francisco](https://sfwedding.org/)

![swedenborgian church of san francisco](https://rehearsaluploads.withjoy.com/uploads/uploads/swedenborgian1-1024x682.jpg)![swedenborgian church of san francisco](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)Photo courtesy of sfweddings.org

If you want a church wedding but fancy a venue that has a cozy feel with rustic decor, the Swedenborgian Church of San Francisco is for you. Located in the Pacific Heights neighborhood, the church was built in 1895 in classic Arts and Crafts style. The church also has three adjacent rooms available for receptions, along with a full-capacity kitchen. They welcome outside officiants, and as an added bonus, the venue is also dog friendly!

**Capacity:** 130

**Typical cost of wedding:** $1,100-$2,200 (Wedding + Reception package available)

## [Presidio Chapel](https://www.presidio.gov/venues/presidio-chapel)

![presidio chapel](https://rehearsaluploads.withjoy.com/uploads/uploads/presidio_chapel1.jpg)![presidio chapel](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)Photo courtesy of presidio.gov

The Presidio of San Francisco is the place to go to get away from it all without actually leaving the city. It also hosts not one but two excellent chapels that are available for wedding rentals! The Presidio Chapel is built in a lovely Spanish mission style. Surrounded by the eucalyptus trees of the Presidio forest, the grounds are situated on a hill that provides amazing views of the bay. The garden is also available for ceremonies or as a reception venue for chapel weddings. And if you fancy and indoor reception, the [Presidio Officers’ Club](https://www.presidio.gov/officers-club) is just a short walk away!

**Capacity:** 154 (chapel) – 200 (garden)

**Typical cost:** $1,200

**Bonus:** Your rental and your additional fees help the Presidio National Park provide public programs, trails, and roads in the park.

## [Chapel of Our Lady](https://www.presidio.gov/venues/chapel-of-our-lady)

![chapel of our lady](https://rehearsaluploads.withjoy.com/uploads/uploads/carousel-1-chapel-of-our-lady.jpg)![chapel of our lady](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)Photo courtesy of presidio.gov

The second church wedding venue that the Presidio offers is the Chapel of Our Lady. Constructed in 1864, this interdenominational chapel is the Presidio’s oldest house of worship. The chapel features rafters with beautiful designs and rustic chandeliers, as well as a large window behind the altar that provides lots of natural light. While the chapel can seat up to 200 guests, it still has a very intimate feel. The chapel courtyard is also available as an excellent outdoor reception space.

**Capacity:** 200

**Typical cost:** $1,200

**Bonus:** The magnificent [Golden Gate Club](https://www.presidio.gov/venues/golden-gate-club) is nearby for receptions, and as with the Presidio Chapel, your rental fees go to the Presidio National Park.

## [Grace Cathedral](https://www.gracecathedral.org/weddings-blessings/)

![grace cathedral san francisco](https://rehearsaluploads.withjoy.com/uploads/uploads/grace_cathedral1-1024x819.jpg)![grace cathedral san francisco](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)Photo courtesy of Grace Cathedral

Grand and iconic, Grace Cathedral is the way to go for a large church wedding. Sitting atop Nob Hill, the cathedral is designed in a French Gothic style and is the third-largest Episcopal cathedral in the nation. The nave can seat up to a 1,000 guests, but if you’re not looking to host many hundreds of attendees, the church includes a few chapels for smaller ceremonies. The cathedral steps also make for great wedding photos!

**Capacity:** 1,000 for the nave, 20-175 for other venues

**Typical cost:** Ceremony packages – $5,000-$8,500, reception venue rentals – $800-$3,200

## [First Unitarian Universalist Church of San Francisco](https://www.uusf.org/church-weddings)

The First Unitarian Universalist Church of San Francisco was completed in 1889 and features a sanctuary with remarkable stained glass windows, a three thousand pipe organ, and a rear balcony. The sanctuary is also notable for its great acoustics (you can even hire their sound technician to make the most of it). The church welcomes ceremonies of any faith tradition, and you may have an outside officiant or hire the services of their clergy. The church also has great reception venues available for dining and dancing, as well as smaller venues for fireside and chapel ceremonies.

**Capacity:** 400

**Typical cost:** $2,000-$3,000
