Overview

Description

Part wagon, part stroller, pure joy ride. The Pivot Xplore makes it easy and fun to embark on family adventures, indoors and out. With two kids in tow, you can transform it instantly from a stroller to a wagon and accommodate two or three kids up to five-years-old. As your family grows, you can add the toddler seat and car seat adapter (sold separately) for even greater versatility. From the playroom to the backyard to the beach, the Pivot Xplore helps you cover more ground and roll with whatever the day brings. The Pivot Xplore is a product of Evenflo, a trusted source of precision-manufactured, high-quality children products for over 100 years. Our team takes a proactive approach to the design of our strollers and travel systems, delivering value and convenience with a relentless focus on safety. If you need tips on ensuring the safest ride for your child, our ParentLink customer service experts are ready to guide you.
