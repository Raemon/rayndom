## **How to Make the Most of Your Honeymoon Fund**

Now that you have an idea of where to register a honeymoon fund, the next step is the fun part — officially setting it up. While requesting monetary gifts is increasingly common, there may still be some people who feel uncomfortable donating them. 

With that in mind, here are a few etiquette tips to follow when creating and sharing with guests.

![five rules of honeymoon fund etiquette](https://withjoy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/5-rules-of-honeymoon-fund-etiquette-mobile.png)![five rules of honeymoon fund etiquette](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20751%201564%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

### **Personalize your registry**

With Joy templates and customizing features, you can create an exciting honeymoon fund registry representing your unique relationship story. Our easy-to-use platform removes the obstacles between guests and your honeymoon fund. 

### **Set clear expectations**

You’ll want to break down your honeymoon vacation into specific experiences and items that “paint a picture” of your itinerary. For example, share the location and mention your accommodation, tours, and dinner plans for the perfect romantic getaway. This strategy makes it more personal than a typical “donations” page, where guests can see that newlyweds are planning a full experience and how they can help achieve it. 

### **Include traditional registry items**

Don’t forgo the traditional wedding registry just yet. It’s still a good idea to include tangible gift items with your honeymoon fund. This way, there are options for wedding guests who prefer the more traditional route, and you can request travel essentials, such as new luggage, to complement your trip experience. 

### **Share it with guests**

When it’s time to spread the word, be transparent yet respectful when expressing your preference for monetary gifts. There are ways to [word honeymoon fund requests](https://withjoy.com/blog/honeymoon-fund-wording/) and strategically promote them in a polite manner, such as:

  * Writing a formal note about donations in lieu of gifts on wedding invitations
  * Placing a link to the honeymoon fund on your [wedding website](https://withjoy.com/wedding-website/)



### **Don’t forget the thank-you notes!**

Expressing gratitude is a must when it comes to any gift, especially monetary. Thankfully (no pun intended), you can customize messages and send thank-you notes directly through your Joy wedding platform. Include photos from the trip to show your appreciation as well as the impact of their contributions to your honeymoon. 

With Joy’s all-in-one wedding registry, newlyweds have everything they need to plan, fund, and share [ideas for the perfect honeymoon](https://withjoy.com/blog/honeymoon-fund-ideas/).
