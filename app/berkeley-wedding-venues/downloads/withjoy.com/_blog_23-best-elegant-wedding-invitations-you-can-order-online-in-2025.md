Gold foil creates magic with warm colors like burgundy and emerald. Silver foil brings out the best in cool tones such as blue and lavender.

### Foil Wedding Invitations Pricing

The specialized production process makes foil wedding invitations more expensive. A 5×7 card costs about $200-225 extra for foil printing. Smaller 3.5×2 cards add $75-100 to regular costs. Most companies let you add foil stamping to their standard invitation prices.

## Letterpress Wedding Invitations

Letterpress wedding invitations represent traditional craftsmanship that dates back to the 15th century. Johannes Gutenberg’s printing press invention created a distinctive tactile experience that stands apart from other invitation styles.

### Letterpress Wedding Invitations Key Features

The letterpress printing technique presses raised surfaces against premium paper. This creates:

  * Deep, pillowy impressions you feel beneath your fingertips
  * Rich, vibrant ink colors with exceptional clarity
  * A tactile texture that awakens multiple senses
  * Crisp text and intricate details
  * Each piece has unique artisanal qualities with subtle variations



### Letterpress Wedding Invitations Design Esthetic

The letterpress’s visual charm comes from its timeless elegance. The original letterpress machines would barely “kiss” the paper. Today’s deep impressions make these invitations highly sought after. This technique pairs beautifully with serif fonts, calligraphy, and botanical illustrations. To name just one example, designs with leafy vines, elegant typography, and clean layouts enhance the letterpress method.

### Letterpress Wedding Invitations Pricing

Letterpress sits at the premium end of invitation options. Minted’s offerings start at $485 for 100 single-color invitations. A second color adds approximately $90 per 100 invitations. Some boutique printers suggest budgeting $5000+ for custom letterpress suites with multiple colors.

### Letterpress Wedding Invitations Best For

Letterpress inks come in more than 50 colors, with up to three colors possible per invitation. Stationers also create coordinating pieces such as save-the-dates, RSVP cards, and thank you notes.

### Letterpress Wedding Invitations Where to Buy

Several reputable retailers offer quality letterpress invitations. Minted includes complimentary envelopes with every order. Our brand Joy balances traditional craftsmanship with contemporary designs in its elegant letterpress collection.

## Embossed Wedding Invitations

Embossed wedding invitations create a sophisticated touch with raised designs that stand out from the page. Unlike letterpress that indents the paper, embossing lifts the design upward and creates an elegant three-dimensional effect that catches light and attention.

### Embossed Wedding Invitations Key Features

The embossing process uses two specialized metal plates—one raised and one recessed—that press paper between them with heat and pressure. This technique creates:

  * Distinctive raised designs with texture
  * Elegant dimension without ink (blind embossing)
  * Superior durability on thick, premium papers
  * A look that photographs beautifully
  * A chance for sculpted embossing with multi-level effects



### Embossed Wedding Invitations Design Esthetic

Embossed invitations express timeless refinement through their texture. The raised elements create shadows that change as the invitation moves, adding visual interest to minimalist designs. This technique works beautifully with monograms, borders, floral motifs, and ornamental flourishes that need special attention.

### Embossed Wedding Invitations Pricing

Embossed invitations are a premium choice, and their prices reflect the craftsmanship. Simple embossed designs range from $3.56 to $4.45 per invitation, while sculpted embossing costs more. Custom embossed suites need 4-6 months of lead time before your wedding date for design and plate production.

### Embossed Wedding Invitations Best For

These invitations excel at formal and upscale celebrations where details matter. They appeal to couples who value heirloom-quality keepsakes that guests remember long after the event.

### Embossed Wedding Invitations Customization Options

You can customize your invitations with:

  * Paper selection (heavyweight cotton, linen, colored cardstock)
  * Foil or letterpress combinations for multi-dimensional effects
  * Edge painting or die-cuts for unique finishing
  * Coordinating embellishments like ribbons and wax seals



### Embossed Wedding Invitations Where to Buy

Our brand Joy provides elegant embossed options with personalized design assistance. Gold Image Printing, The Invitation Depot, and specialty stationers also offer custom embossing services.

UV printing technology adds a new dimension to wedding invitations with its distinctive raised texture on printed colors. This modern printing method works like thermography but gives you more options and better visual results.

### UV Printed Invitations Key Features

UV printed invitations stand out with these advantages:

  * Raised texture on **all** colors that blend naturally
  * Mirror-like finish with glossy appearance
  * Strong resistance to scratches and fading

  * You can use permanent markers for addressing (just let them dry properly)



### UV Printed Invitations Design Esthetic

UV printed invitations look stunning with their bright colors and texture you can feel. Each detail stands out with a dimensional quality that catches light and draws attention. The glossy finish makes your invitations look more luxurious and the colors appear richer and more vibrant. Designs with flowers, detailed borders, and monograms look amazing with the raised texture highlighting specific elements.

### UV Printed Invitations Pricing

UV printing looks expensive but won’t break your budget. It costs about the same as regular thermography. This makes it a great choice for couples who want high-end stationery without paying letterpress or engraving prices.
