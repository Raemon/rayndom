### Sanitization sign

![wedding welcome sign ideas](https://withjoy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/il_1588xN.2861733496_n7iq-1024x715.jpg)![wedding welcome sign ideas](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201024%20715%22%3E%3C/svg%3E) _[Photo by TheWriteGirlShop on Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/listing/946268724/be-wise-sanitize-covid-19-acrylic-sign?ga_order=most_relevant&ga_search_type=all&ga_view_type=gallery&ga_search_query=sanitize+sign&ref=sr_gallery-1-12&organic_search_click=1)_

One way to have guests use your wedding hashtag is to include it on a sign. Prominently display your hashtag along with an Instagram symbol. It’ll be fun to see the photos that guests took during your wedding day.

Using a reception sign to indicate where guests are seated will alleviate confusion. A seating chart sign can be placed near your wedding reception entrance so guests can easily see it.

### Table numbers

Having table numbers that match your seating chart can be a special touch. Place numbers so the centerpiece doesn’t block the view and guests can easily find their designated table.

### Bar sign

Use signage to let guests know whether it’s an open bar or they need to pay cash. Not only can a sign help let guests know the type of bar service you’re offering, but you can also use one to describe your signature drinks.

### Chair signs

** _Use wedding signs on your reception chairs to save your seats._**

Quite often, couples place signs on their wedding reception chairs. Whatever wording you choose, there are several wording options to indicate that your chairs are reserved.

### Personalized signs

Sometimes couples have specific signage needs on their big day. Here are a few other instances where you may want a personalized sign.

  * Point to restrooms for an outdoor wedding.
  * Place a sign by your wedding cake to indicate flavor.
  * Designate the wedding table used for gifts.
  * Use a board to instruct guests to put their phones away during the ceremony.
  * Include a sign that has your favorite verse or saying.
  * Have your photographer take a photo of you and your partner holding signs that say “Thank You” to use on your post-wedding Thank You notes.

### 4\. Rose gold wedding sign

![wedding welcome sign ideas](https://withjoy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/il_1588xN.2095885954_5xww-1024x821.jpg)![wedding welcome sign ideas](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201024%20821%22%3E%3C/svg%3E) _[Photo by UnlimitedStudio on Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/listing/683601193/wedding-welcome-sign-welcome-to-our?ga_order=most_relevant&ga_search_type=all&ga_view_type=gallery&ga_search_query=rose+gold+wedding+sign+welcome&ref=sr_gallery-1-2&organic_search_click=1&frs=1)_
