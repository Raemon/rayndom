The Bay Area abounds with natural beauty. It also offers a favorable climate for outdoor events during most of the year. It’s no wonder, then, that the region also boasts an abundance of great outdoor wedding venues. From dramatic coastal backdrops to redwood groves to secluded gardens, here are our favorite outdoor wedding venues in the Bay Area.

## [Slide Ranch](https://slideranch.org/weddingvenues/)

![outdoor wedding venues in the bay area](https://rehearsaluploads.withjoy.com/uploads/uploads/slide-ranch-yurt.jpeg)![outdoor wedding venues in the bay area](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20500%20262%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Just off of scenic Highway 1, Slide Ranch provides breathtaking views of the Pacific Ocean. It also has three locations for wedding ceremonies and receptions that you can rent separately or in combination. You can have your ceremony overlooking the ocean, while the new Farm-to-Table Teaching Center includes a full kitchen and deck area, making it great for your reception. Best of all, all proceeds go to support its nonprofit mission of connecting kids with nature!

**Capacity:** 150

**Typical cost:** $7,800-$11,800

**Bonus:** Slide Ranch also has a luxurious bell tent available to rent so you can go glamping on your wedding night!

## [Hastings House](https://www.hastingshouseweddings.com/)

![hastings house garden weddings](https://rehearsaluploads.withjoy.com/uploads/uploads/hastingshouse.jpg)![hastings house garden weddings](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%202048%20599%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

www.facebook.com/HastingsHouseGardenWeddings/

Photos can’t do it justice. The stunningly beautiful gardens of the Hastings House in Half Moon Bay really have to be seen to be believed. The beautiful array of flowers are in bloom for most of the year, and the proximity to the ocean (literally just a few steps away!) make it one of the Bay Area’s hidden gems.

**Capacity:** 100

**Typical cost:** $900 – $3,500

**Bonus:** The garden only hosts one wedding per day, and couples enjoy complete privacy for their ceremony.

## [Shakespeare Garden](https://sfrecpark.org/913/Golden-Gate-Park---Shakespeare-Garden)

![shakespeare garden](https://rehearsaluploads.withjoy.com/uploads/uploads/shakespear-garden.jpg)![shakespeare garden](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20600%20400%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

[sfrecpark.org](https://www.sfrecpark.org)

San Francisco’s Golden Gate Park offers several excellent wedding venues, but the most popular of all is the Shakespeare Garden. And once you take a stroll through this romantic refuge, it’s easy to see why. The garden is so named because it only features plants mentioned in the playwright’s works. As a venue, it’s eminently affordable, though the high demand means you’ll have to be ready to grab the date you want as soon as you can. Reservations can only be made up to one year in advance, and it’s not unheard of for couples to camp out in front of the permits and reservations office to get their preferred date!

**Capacity:** 200

**Typical Cost:** $448 reservation fee, $128 per hour

**Bonus:** The nearby [DeYoung museum](https://deyoung.famsf.org/) is a great venue for your reception!

The East Bay has its share of picturesque outdoor locations, as well. If you’re looking to host your ceremony and reception in one convenient location, the Piedmont Community Center is a superb choice.

But for your ceremony you can’t beat the adjacent park with its beautiful redwoods serving as a backdrop for the event.

**Capacity:** 120 indoors, 200 outdoors
