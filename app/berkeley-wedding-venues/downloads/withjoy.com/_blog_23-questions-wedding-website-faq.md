Along with congratulatory messages, your wedding day will inevitably bring myriad questions from each and every one of your guests. From the minute you send out your [save the dates](https://withjoy.com/blog/save-the-dates-etiquette/) — and possibly even before — you’ll be fielding inquiries about everything from plus ones to the dress code. The best way to address them all? A wedding website FAQ page. Filled with succinct answers to your guests’ most frequently asked questions, this central hub can be one of the most valuable assets on your [wedding website](https://withjoy.com/wedding-website/). Whether they’re looking for a link to your gift registry or lost the RSVP card you sent out with your [wedding invitations](https://withjoy.com/blog/wedding-invitation-guide-etiquette-wording-design/), this page is where you can put all those worries at ease. By answering these important questions in your wedding website FAQ, you’ll be able to focus your attention on planning and getting excited for the big day ahead.

## **Questions for Your Wedding Website FAQ:**

### **1\. What should I wear? Is there a dress code?**

“The dress code for our wedding is [semi-formal](https://withjoy.com/blog/semi-formal-wedding-attire/)/cocktail attire. Think cocktail dresses or a suit and tie or a sports coat.”

**Tip:** Wedding attire can be tricky. In addition to providing a [dress code](https://withjoy.com/blog/wedding-dress-codes-deciphered/), avoid confusion by letting your wedding guests know specifically what they should wear. For example, recommend a suit and tie for cocktail attire, or a tux, formal gown or floor-length dress if you’re going for a black-tie vibe.

### **2\. What will the weather be like this time of year?**

**Tip:** Let your out-of-town guests know the general weather conditions for your wedding’s location. Advise them to bring a jacket or warm layers if the weather will be chilly or an umbrella to get from the parking lot into your reception venue if rain is in the forecast.

### **3\. Where are the ceremony and the reception taking place?**

**Tip:** While some weddings have the same venue for the ceremony and the reception, others do not. Make this clear for your guests and provide them with the addresses for each venue, along with any information on transportation between sites.

### **4\. Will the ceremony and reception be indoors or outdoors?**

“The ceremony will be taking place in an outdoor garden; we recommend flat-soled shoes or wedges to avoid sinking into the grass. The reception will be held indoors.”

**Tip:** It’s important for guests to know if they will be indoors or outdoors so they can plan accordingly. For example, guests may need to bring sunscreen or wear different shoes, like for a [summer wedding](https://withjoy.com/blog/summer-wedding-ideas/). 

### **5\. What happens after the ceremony?**

“After the ceremony, the wedding party will be taking pictures nearby for around an hour. Guests can head straight to the reception hall, where we will be serving finger foods and beverages during a cocktail hour.”

**Tip:** It’s important to let your guests know what to do during the [time in-between](https://withjoy.com/blog/wedding-schedule-tips/) the ceremony and reception. If guests need to spend a few hours on their own before the reception, provide them with recommendations for fun things to do in the area.

### **6\. Are there other wedding events I can attend?**

**Tip:** This can be a difficult question to navigate. Of course, do remind your guests of any planned festivities before or after the wedding, such as brunches, happy hours or an after-party. But our recommendation is to only mention events that all guests are invited to so that no one feels left out. With some wedding website builders like Joy, you can also create custom schedules for each guest and skip this question entirely. 

### **7\. Am I invited to the rehearsal dinner?**

“Due to the space limitations of our venue, we unfortunately have to limit the rehearsal dinner guest list to those who will be playing a role in the ceremony. We apologize in advance to those who are not included.”

**Tip:** As this can be a sensitive topic, you can also remind your guests of any pre- or post-wedding events that they are invited to, even if this is just an after-party that all guests are welcome to attend.

### **8\. How do I get to the wedding venue?**

**Tip:** Many people will put the venue’s address in their smartphones — but just in case, provide additional directions, especially if there are any tricky routes.

### **9\. What time should I arrive?**

“Help us get the party started as scheduled! We recommend that you arrive an hour before the start of the ceremony to make sure everyone is seated on time.”

### **10\. Where should guests park? Is parking free?**

**Tip:** Let your guests know where to park, if there is a valet service, whether or not parking is limited, and how much they should expect to pay for parking. If a rideshare service is recommended due to limited parking, this is a good place to mention that to your guests. 

### **11\. Are kids welcome?**

“While we love your little ones, our wedding will be an adults-only event so that everyone can relax and enjoy the evening. We appreciate you making arrangements ahead of time and leaving the kids at home so you can celebrate with us.”

**Tip:** Welcoming children on your big day can be a delicate issue, so check out [these tips](https://withjoy.com/blog/tips-child-free-wedding/) for further help.

### **12\. Can I bring a plus one?**

“Unfortunately, we have a strict guest list to stay on budget. Our celebration is strictly RSVP only. We will only be able to accommodate those listed on your wedding invitation.”

**Tip:** Be polite yet firm when it comes to questions about plus ones. It’s usually a good idea to indicate on each RSVP card how many seats have been reserved for that household.

### **13\. Do you have a hotel block for guests? Where do you recommend I stay?**

**Tip:** Let your guests know if you reserved any hotel room blocks, as well as the pricing, address and how to book. It’s also helpful to provide alternative hotel options in the area in case the rooms you reserved are not within their budget. 

### **14\. When is the RSVP deadline? Do I need to mail back my RSVP or can I do it online?**

“Thank you in advance for sending your RSVP before [RSVP deadline]. You can mail back the card enclosed in your invitation or simply RSVP right here on our wedding website.” 

**Tip:** If you prefer guests to submit an online RSVP, it’s helpful to include a direct link to the RSVP page in this FAQ.

### **15\. Are the ceremony and reception location wheelchair accessible?**

**Tip:** Inform guests in advance of the venue’s accessibility, including any stairs, wheelchair ramps or elevators. It may also be helpful to note if the terrain will be tricky for those using wheelchairs, walkers, canes or other accessibility aids. 

### **16\. Will there be food and drinks during cocktail hour?**

“After the wedding ceremony, we will be serving light passed hors d’oeuvres accompanied by an open bar. We invite you to toast to our nuptials with a curated selection of wine, beer and our signature cocktail.”

**Tip:** While it’s not necessary to share exactly what you will be serving at the cocktail party, it’s nice to give guests an idea of what they can expect so they can plan accordingly. If you choose not to host an open bar, be sure to note this for guests so they can bring cash. 

### **17\. Will dinner be served at the reception? What kind of food?**

**Tip:** Notify your guests ahead of time whether or not food and drinks will be served and what type of food — for example, whether you’re providing appetizers or a full sit-down meal.

### **18\. Will there be any vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free or special diet options?**

**Tip:** Let your guests know if you can accommodate special dietary restrictions and if they need to contact you ahead of time.

### **19\. Where are you registered?**

“We are so thankful you will be joining us for this celebration of our love. While gifts are not expected, we have registered for a few items we need for our newlywed home. A link to our wedding registry can be found here.” 

**Tip:** You may politely direct your guests to your registry or let them know if you have any special requests for wedding gifts — for example, charity donations.

### **20\. Should I bring a gift to your destination wedding?**

“Since you’re traveling for our wedding, making the trip is a gift in itself — physical gifts are absolutely not necessary! If you do choose to browse our wedding registry, however, any items on the list can be shipped directly to our home address.” 

**Tip:** Make sure to emphasize that your guest’s presence is enough, but also politely provide options based on your unique needs if they do insist on gifting. For destination weddings in particular, for example, you could mention that guests are able to add a tour or spa treatment to your planned itinerary to help make your big weekend or honeymoon extra-special.

### **21\. Will transportation be provided between the to and from the hotel, ceremony and reception?**

**Tip:** Be as clear as possible to let guests know if they are responsible for their own transportation or if you have made arrangements on their behalf. If you have booked transportation for guests, such as a shuttle to take them from your hotel to the ceremony and reception venue, include information such as where to park, where the shuttle will pick them up, and departure times. 

### **22\. Do you have any recommendations for where to eat, points of interest or things to do?**

“Yes! We recommend visiting the ‘Things to Do’ page of our wedding website, where we’ve compiled all of our favorite local hot spots and fun things to do in the area, including coffee shops, spas and restaurants to visit before or after the wedding.”

**Tip:** For destination weddings, you may want to play a larger role in helping your guests plan their free time by creating one or two sample itineraries filled with things they may enjoy. Your venue or wedding planner should be able to provide you with some recommendations as well.

### **23\. I still have questions. What is the best way to contact you?**

**Tip:** Your guests may still have a few questions after going through your wedding website FAQ. Let them know the best way to reach you or your wedding planner. It’s also helpful to list a day-of contact so you and your partner aren’t flooded with questions as you’re getting ready to say “I do.”
