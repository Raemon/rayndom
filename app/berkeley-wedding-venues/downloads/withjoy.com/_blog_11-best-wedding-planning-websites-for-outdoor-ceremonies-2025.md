My search through many [wedding website](https://withjoy.com/wedding-website/) builders led me to Joy, a detailed platform that blends beautiful design with powerful planning tools. Joy’s system includes over 600 customizable templates and matching stationery options that streamline the wedding planning process.

**Cons:**

  * Design variety is nowhere near some competitors
  * Computer access needed for some guest list editing functions instead of the app
  * Guests who aren’t tech-savvy might find the app download suggestion confusing



### Joy pricing

Joy keeps pricing refreshingly simple—all core wedding planning features are free. The platform makes money through registry purchases and optional premium upgrades instead of charging couples. Optional add-ons include:

  * Custom domain: $21.99/year
  * Premium digital stationery designs (simple designs stay free)
  * Text messaging services



### Joy best for

Joy shines for couples planning outdoor ceremonies who need flexibility and reliable communication tools. The platform works best for:

  * Weddings with multiple outdoor events needing separate guest lists and privacy settings
  * Couples who want to collect and share photos throughout their wedding experience
  * Budget-conscious planners needing professional-quality tools without the cost
  * Tech-savvy couples who value mobile functionality and digital RSVPs



Joy’s weather update features and announcement capabilities provide quick communication channels when outdoor ceremony plans need weather-related adjustments.

## [The Knot](https://www.theknot.com/)

The Knot has grown into one of the most recognized names among the [best wedding planning websites](https://withjoy.com/blog/best-wedding-websites/) over the last several years since 1996. Married couple Carley Roney and David Liu created this platform after experiencing wedding planning anxieties themselves. They’ve helped more than 25 million couples plan their authentic weddings.
