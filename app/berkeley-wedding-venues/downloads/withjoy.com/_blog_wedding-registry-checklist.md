![Screenshot of Joy wedding registry checklist tool](https://withjoy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/wedding-registry-1.jpg)![Screenshot of Joy wedding registry checklist tool](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20781%20521%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Joy’s All-In-One Registry also allows syncing and transferring of external registries so you can track all of them in one convenient place. And, by installing Joy’s easy one-click “add to registry” browser button, you will be able to add any item you find online to your registry.

As a bonus, you also have the option to set up cash funds for honeymoon experiences, accept donations for your favorite charities, or request gift cards for major retailers like Lowe’s, Airbnb, and Southwest Airlines.

## [Your wedding registry, your way](https://withjoy.com/registry/)

From gifts, to cash funds, experiences or charitable causes, add any gift you want, from any online retailer, to your Joy registry.

[![](https://withjoy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/reg-1-1-1024x749.jpg)![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201024%20749%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)](https://withjoy.com/registry/)

## **Etiquette: Do’s and Don’ts**

There are no hard and fast rules when it comes to your wedding registry. The most important thing to remember is that what’s right for one couple may not work for another. These simple do’s and don’ts will help you stay on the right track [as you create your wedding registry](https://withjoy.com/blog/how-to-make-a-wedding-registry/).

![Couple shopping and looking at bathroom accessories](https://withjoy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/shopping.jpg)![Couple shopping and looking at bathroom accessories](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20781%20521%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

### ****Do create a registry** **

By creating a registry, you can help eliminate uncertainty and relieve gift-giving stress. Even if you’d appreciate any gift you receive for your big day, some guests find it hard to choose the perfect thing. A Joy registry keeps it simple, with the ability to add gift items, charity donations, or a honeymoon fund all in one place.

### **Don’t wait until the last minute**

Setting up your registry early makes it easier for guests to find a gift you’ll love. If you start soon after your engagement, it allows early birds to shop when it’s most convenient for them and allows you to add new items in the months leading up to your wedding day. 

### **Do give guests a range to choose from**

When selecting registry items, be mindful that your guests may all be working with different budgets. Include some options at different price points. Guests may opt to split the cost of higher priced items through Joy’s Group Gifting feature, while others may prefer to gift you with a specific dollar amount through a [Cash Fund](https://withjoy.com/cash-fund-registry/). 

### **Don’t be afraid to add more expensive gifts**

The average cash value of a wedding gift is around $99, but not every gift needs to be at or below this price point. If there’s a product or experience that you’d love to receive, don’t be afraid to add it to your list. With a Joy wedding registry, your guests can benefit from the Group Gifting feature which allows multiple guests to contribute towards one higher ticket item. Or someone among your family and friends may simply be feeling extra generous.

### **Do expect the unexpected**

Keep in mind that some guests will choose to find their own gifts that are wildly different from what you had envisioned and requested via your registry. Remember, it’s the thought that counts — enjoy the surprise! 

### **Don’t forget to share your registry**

Once you’ve created your wedding registry, share it with your guests. Many couples include a reference or link to their registry with their [save-the-date cards](https://withjoy.com/blog/save-the-date-ideas/) or wedding invitations. After the invitations go out, your [wedding website](https://withjoy.com/blog/best-wedding-website-builders-ranked/) becomes the go-to place guests look to for registry information. If you create a Joy registry, a wedding website template is automatically set up with a link to all your items. 

As you go through this wedding registry checklist, remember to enjoy the process! Have fun selecting items that resonate with you and your partner, and cherish the moments you’ll create with each and every gift.

## **Wedding Registry FAQ**

Crafting a wedding registry can be intimidating for some. These are some additional questions that often come up when couples start the process.

****How many items should be on a wedding registry?****

The [number of items on your wedding registry](https://withjoy.com/blog/how-many-gifts-to-have-on-your-registry/) depends on your preferences and needs, but a good rule of thumb is to **double the total number of people on your guest list for a rough quantity of gifts to add**. You can start with a core list of essentials and then add more to get twice as many items as you have planned guests. This will provide a range of items and price point options your guests can choose from to find the perfect gift.

****Can I have more than one registry?****

Yes, you can have more than one wedding registry! It’s becoming increasingly common for couples to have multiple registries. This allows you to include various items from different retailers to suit your preferences and the budget needs of your guests.

****Can I register for money on my registry?****

You can absolutely register for money or cash funds on your wedding registry. Many couples today opt for cash funds for various purposes like a honeymoon fund, home renovation, or saving for the future. It gives your guests the flexibility to contribute to experiences or goals that are important to you and your partner.
