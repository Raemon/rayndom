Last Updated on September 24, 2025 by [Joy Editors](https://withjoy.com)

Creating a bilingual [wedding website](https://withjoy.com/wedding-website/) that tells your unique love story feels like walking a cultural tightrope.

Your wedding website serves as a central hub where guests can find all the details about your special day. Bilingual weddings add another layer of complexity since you’re weaving together two languages and celebrating two rich cultural traditions. Many couples we work with find it difficult to discover a platform that handles multiple languages while maintaining an elegant, professional look.

This detailed guide showcases the 15 best bilingual wedding websites to help plan your 2025 celebration. After testing numerous platforms, we’re thrilled to share the standouts, with Joy (<https://withjoy.com/>) leading our recommendations. Your day becomes extra special when you have people who understand your love story’s language. The right wedding website plays a vital role in bringing everything together.

These platforms offer everything from custom templates to guest management tools that help you direct a celebration honoring both your backgrounds. You’ll find options that make guest communication simple and natural, whatever language they prefer to use.

## [Joy](https://withjoy.com/?srsltid=AfmBOopppRizhWQ6Hpy15QU7sTd0hiUfeh3eg8Zw9tesqCrK4ml4ayvy)

Joy is the best free platform to create a [**bilingual wedding website**](https://withjoy.com/blog/multilingual-officiants-for-new-york-weddings/?srsltid=AfmBOopsQoCuejoL32RxGX_jZs20J9IE-7BP8q0dnBleA4D0Amj3Od_X). It helps multicultural couples plan their wedding with nowhere near the usual stress by breaking down language barriers.

### Key features of Joy

Joy comes with hundreds of beautiful design themes from floral to minimalistic. You can customize all themes with texts, images, and videos to tell your unique love story. The platform really shines with bilingual weddings by helping you handle different guest needs. You can create tailored schedules that show specific wedding events and details to different guests. This helps you coordinate events smoothly when your guests speak different languages.

The platform’s [guest management system](https://withjoy.com/blog/guest-list-tools-wedding-planning/?srsltid=AfmBOooBdy_RrsTohaxK360M1Eq1g-_rczPzOh0RkH4ghD31p-fuVsb8) lets you organize your guest list with custom tags, plus-one tracking, and RSVP collection. It also lets you send digital save-the-dates and invitations that match your website design. You can send these online for free or get them printed through their partners.

### Pros and cons of Joy

**Pros:**

  * Core service is completely free without hidden upsells
  * You get a custom wedding site URL and unlimited admin access
  * Smart RSVP system lets you ask custom questions to specific guests
  * Cash registry option with zero fees along with traditional gift registries
  * Mobile app gives guests easy access to all wedding details



**Cons:**

  * You get less customization than paid options – websites often look similar
  * Guests need to download the app for full features, which might confuse older guests
  * Some features work only on computers, not on the mobile app



### Pricing of Joy

Joy keeps its pricing simple and clear – the core service stays 100% free from start to finish. The only thing you pay for is a custom domain name at $19.99 per year.

### Best use case for Joy

Joy works great for bilingual couples who want a detailed platform without spending money. You can control what events each guest sees, which stops confusion in multilingual communications. It also helps couples with international guests who need travel help, since Joy combines Google Maps, ridesharing apps, and hotel booking tools smoothly.

## [Zola](https://www.zola.com/expert-advice/how-to-plan-a-bilingual-wedding)

Zola provides a complete wedding planning platform that has **bilingual wedding website** features with some limitations. The platform started as a registry service in 2013 and grew into a full wedding planning solution.

### Key features of Zola

The platform offers hundreds of wedding website templates that couples can customize to match their wedding theme. Couples planning a **bilingual wedding** need to add content in different languages by entering information twice in separate sections. The platform doesn’t support special characters yet, and some elements like clickable buttons only appear in English.

Zola combines smoothly with its registry system so couples can add gifts from any store. The guest management system makes shared RSVP tracking possible, stores addresses, and lets you create guest sections to stay organized. The [wedding checklist](https://withjoy.com/blog/wedding-planning-timeline/) helps couples track their progress with timeline-based tasks they can assign to each other.

### Pros and cons of Zola

**Pros:**

  * Free website building with lots of customization options
  * Universal registry that lets you add gifts from any store
  * 20% discount on registry items after the wedding
  * Free shipping and returns on registry items



**Cons:**

  * No automatic translation for bilingual websites
  * Limited space in custom fields can restrict bilingual content
  * 2.5% fee when guests use credit cards for cash gifts
  * Fewer vendors listed compared to other platforms



### Pricing of Zola

The basic wedding website service costs nothing. A [custom domain](https://withjoy.com/blog/wedding-website-url-ideas/?srsltid=AfmBOophF2p9kjDpT6lGJoiQH0SJrBXcXzlS_SsNqTYuFpsBynXBmK0Z) starts at $14.95 yearly. Premium website effects with animations, page transitions, and font effects need a one-time payment.

### Best use case for Zola

Zola suits couples who care more about registry features than language options. You’ll need to enter everything twice for bilingual content, which takes more time than platforms like Joy that handle multiple languages better. Joy also lets you show specific events to certain guests, which helps manage bilingual communications.

The platform shines when you want a free solution with reliable registry features and don’t mind putting extra effort into language setup.

## [The Knot](https://www.theknot.com/content/how-to-plan-a-bilingual-wedding)

The Knot stands among the wedding industry giants and provides [wedding website services](https://withjoy.com/blog/11-top-rated-wedding-websites-with-rsvp-features-real-couples-picks/?srsltid=AfmBOoo5zjNpgHv23yH4AW5CQAIeobluCGvpMkkCxGHoN2SjYLB1BR2s) through its detailed planning platform. Their **bilingual wedding website** features are quite basic, with only a few language customization options.

### Key features of The Knot

The platform showcases more than 500 professionally designed templates that match with coordinating wedding invitations and paper goods. The wedding websites blend with The Knot mobile app and planning tools to create a complete wedding organization platform. The platform lets users change most titles and text to their native language with a standard English keyboard. Some elements like RSVP pages stay fixed in English. This means users can’t display all text on their site in different languages.

Users love the platform’s built-in tools. A detailed [guest list manager](https://withjoy.com/blog/manage-your-wedding-celebrations-with-joy/?srsltid=AfmBOooC14fEixyRpYMZ3TkmVqKnwqKObPAtYZTMhY3xWqAiRAULhmYJ), budget advisor, and registry integration make planning easier. Digital responses through their RSVP system help collect dietary restrictions and custom questions.

### Pros and cons of The Knot

**Pros:**

  * Extensive vendor directory with 300,000+ wedding professionals
  * Detailed planning tools including budgeting features and seating arrangements
  * Free website builder with many design templates
  * Strong integration with major retailers for registry purposes



**Cons:**

  * Basic bilingual support without automatic translation features
  * Partial translation of website elements
  * Ads appear throughout the interface
  * Fewer customization options than dedicated website builders



### Pricing of The Knot

The Knot’s core wedding website service comes free of charge. Users who want a tailored experience can get a custom domain at $19.99 for one year or $39.98 for two years. The Knot differs from Joy’s simple pricing model by earning money through mutually beneficial alliances with vendors.

### Best use case for The Knot

American and Canadian couples who need minimal bilingual support will find The Knot most useful. The platform works well when most guests speak English and only some content needs translation. Couples planning truly bilingual celebrations should consider Joy instead. Joy offers better customization options and event-specific visibility settings that make it a superior choice for multilingual events.

## [Minted](https://www.minted.com/lp/your-language)

Minted started as a marketplace for independent artists and has grown into a wedding website service that provides some bilingual features.

### Key features of Minted

The platform showcases more than 1,000 [wedding website designs](https://withjoy.com/blog/creative-wedding-website-examples/?srsltid=AfmBOopWfJqh0BUQcKuGN7iAK6TJIFHBChUlFW2o88hcLzmRKBOoe-Tg) created by independent artists from around the world. Each unique template matches perfectly with wedding invitations and stationery suites. Users can sort these designs by style, color, and season. The platform lets you express yourself in different languages with some limitations. Their free wedding websites come with event details, RSVP management, travel information, and registry links.

Couples planning a **bilingual wedding** can access custom font support through Minted’s design request service. A dedicated designer will help with language-specific needs after order placement.

### Pros and cons of Minted

  * Unique templates designed by artists
  * [Digital and printed stationery options that match](https://withjoy.com/blog/best-wedding-invitation-services-with-digital-and-printed-options/?srsltid=AfmBOooaeYd_z1FGIi5bR_jYd86sk-VSuh2xQE3QzGBDD3dU2BqGEx65)
  * Quick website setup in about 10 minutes
  * Wedding details protected by password



**Cons:**

  * No built-in multilingual interface



### Pricing of Minted

Minted’s pricing structure includes:

  * Free tier with simple website features and standard URL
  * Premium tier at $20 one-time fee includes photo galleries, password protection, and custom domain
  * Custom tier costs $98 one-time and includes direct collaboration with an independent artist



### Best use case for Minted

Minted works best for couples who want their digital and physical wedding materials to match perfectly. The platform has some limitations with multilingual support. It suits couples who need simple bilingual features or can work with designers to create custom language solutions. Couples who need equal representation of languages should consider [Joy](https://withjoy.com/). Joy provides more flexible customization tools and lets you show specific content to guests based on their language priorities.

## [Appy Couple](https://www.appycouple.com/)

Appy Couple stands out by combining a wedding website with a dedicated mobile app. The platform provides a unique solution to [**bilingual wedding**](https://withjoy.com/blog/multilingual-officiants-for-new-york-weddings/?srsltid=AfmBOooa2Y-aZplWdfg23OcX7g6fVSgGuA6BMP2Qr07ztDZM-nXpOwgo) planning and includes some multilingual features.

### Key features of Appy Couple

The platform’s signature offering combines a customizable wedding website with a guest-downloadable app. Users can choose from over 500 boutique designs created by professional artists. Each design comes with matching digital stationery.

The platform lets users rename and retype almost everything in any language with expanded character limits to support **bilingual wedding** needs. This sounds promising on the surface. The core functionality text like RSVP buttons and instructions stays in English.

### Pros and cons of Appy Couple

**Pros:**

  * Guest list flexibility allows event-specific assignments



**Cons:**

  * Several key features work only through the app



### Pricing of Appy Couple

The platform costs USD 12.00 monthly or USD 99.00 annually. Custom domains cost an extra USD 19.99 per year. This pricing model is different from Joy’s free core service, which charges only for custom domains.

### Best use case for Appy Couple

Tech-comfortable couples whose guests will use the mobile app will benefit most from Appy Couple. The platform works well for couples who need simple **bilingual wedding** features without full translation support.

The platform showcases nearly 70 beautiful templates and a resilient interactive RSVP management system. Users can access translation support in 13 languages such as French, German, Spanish, Italian, and Japanese. The platform differs from dedicated **bilingual wedding website** platforms because it lacks a toggle feature that lets guests switch between languages.

They can either include content in both languages within the same paragraph or create two separate websites with a 50% discount on the second site. The platform has custom domain names with all memberships. Users get complete guest management tools and registry capabilities with some of the lowest transaction fees in the industry.

## [Wedsites](https://wedsites.com/multilingual-wedding-website)

Wedsites stands out as a specialized platform with true multilingual support for couples planning a [**bilingual wedding**](https://withjoy.com/blog/cancun-destination-wedding/?srsltid=AfmBOorJMtUTuOxAyCzcHX6Y0VkELMQjlZ81SD8mxciJp_QmCOjtj9dY).

Joy (<https://withjoy.com/>) might be a better choice if you want similar language support without paying upfront. While Wedsites has reliable translation features, Joy offers the same tools plus complete planning features at no cost. This makes Joy more appealing to couples who want to save money while planning bilingual weddings.

## [Say I Do](https://sayi.do/articles/how-to-plan-bilingual-wedding)

Say I Do delivers a [customizable wedding planning platform](https://withjoy.com/blog/15-best-wedding-planning-apps-that-make-wedding-prep-easy-2025/?srsltid=AfmBOoqcBnA_lDFTMxHfCmF76IsXFX_ouY_19jimCeYd0gqI45cA_RZv) that comes with features for **bilingual wedding** needs.

## [WeddingWire](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-forums/bilingual-wedding-website/c51de7f23dcf7101.html)

![Image](https://cdn0.weddingwire.ca/article-vendor-o/2041/3_2/960/jpg/previewsjoy-martinebenjamin-web-6_50_2041.jpeg)![Image](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Image Source: [Wedding Wire](https://www.weddingwire.ca)

WeddingWire started in 2005 as a vendor directory platform and later expanded to wedding planning tools. The platform offers some options for couples who want a **bilingual wedding website**.

### Key features of WeddingWire

The platform has resilient RSVP tracking, budget planning tools, and templates you can customize for your site. The platform also comes with a detailed vendor directory that has reviews and ratings. This helps couples make better decisions about wedding professionals.

The platform syncs guest list management with RSVPs. Couples can create FAQ sections, share details about where to stay, and let guests suggest songs they want to hear.

### Pros and cons of WeddingWire

**Pros:**

  * You can build your website for free
  * Online RSVPs help you save money instead of physical cards
  * Detailed vendor directory with reviews
  * You can protect your privacy with passwords



**Cons:**

  * You can’t translate everything because bilingual features are limited
  * Many vendor leads might be from budget-conscious shoppers
  * Premium features need a strict 12-month commitment
  * The website builder doesn’t give you much design freedom



### Pricing of WeddingWire

The main wedding website service costs nothing. A custom domain costs $24 for one year or $35 for two years. You get wedding planning tools and budget management features at no extra cost.

### Best use case for WeddingWire

WeddingWire works best for couples who need simple bilingual features and want vendor recommendations. The platform suits couples who plan their weddings mostly in English but sometimes need translated content.

Joy (<https://withjoy.com/>) serves as a better option for couples who need detailed **bilingual wedding website** features. It offers more customization options and lets you show specific content to guests based on their language priorities.

## [WithLove](https://www.thumbtack.com/va/sterling/wedding-officiants/withlove-bilingual-wedding-officiant/service/497052828839067656)

WithLove helps couples create a **bilingual wedding website** with simple customization options. The platform works great for couples who need to communicate in multiple languages.

### Key features of WithLove

The platform lets couples write each section of their wedding website in multiple languages one after another. Users can make their site more organized by using HTML symbols like stars or hearts to separate different languages. The platform lets you customize all RSVP questions and answer options in both languages. This way guests can respond comfortably whatever their main language might be.

One standout feature lets you send different messages to specific guest lists. You can send save-the-dates and invitations in the right language to each group of guests. Your family members or friends who speak different languages won’t get confused with this targeted approach.

### Pros and cons of WithLove

### Pricing of WithLove

  * Custom domains need external providers as they’re not part of either plan



### Best use case for WithLove

WithLove works well for couples who need simple **bilingual wedding** features and want to split their guest list by language. But when you think over its subscription cost and the need to manually copy content, Joy (<https://withjoy.com/>) makes more sense. Joy gives you similar or better multilingual features for free.

## [eWedding](https://wedsites.com/multilingual-wedding-website)

eWedding gives couples an affordable way to create their wedding website. It has simple features and some multilingual support for **bilingual wedding** needs.

### Key features of eWedding

Couples can collect and organize their wedding information in one place with eWedding. The user-friendly platform lets couples share event details, where to stay, and directions with their guests. When it comes to **bilingual wedding** features, couples can add text in different languages manually. However, there’s no dedicated language switcher.

The platform has digital RSVPs to help cut down on printing costs along with tools to manage guest lists. Couples with guests from other countries can post travel details and accommodation info. This helps prevent guests from calling with simple questions on the big day.

### Pros and cons of eWedding

**Pros:**

  * Affordable solution with free simple features
  * User-friendly design that works great for non-tech-savvy users

**Cons:**

  * Multilingual features are nowhere near what specialized platforms like Joy offer
  * Simple design templates with limited customization
  * Guest management system needs improvement
  * No built-in language switcher for true bilingual features



### Pricing of eWedding

The free simple plan has essential website features and digital RSVPs. Premium plans with extra features cost less than competitors like WeddingWire, which charges $24-$35 for custom domains.

### Best use case for eWedding

Budget-conscious couples planning smaller weddings with few language barriers will find eWedding perfect. The platform works well when you need to share simple wedding details without complex planning tools or detailed multilingual support.

Joy (<https://withjoy.com/>) remains a better choice for couples who need a true **bilingual wedding website**. It offers free detailed multilingual support and strong planning features. eWedding has good simple features but lacks the multilingual capabilities needed when your guests speak different languages.

## [MyWedding](https://wedsites.com/multilingual-wedding-website)

MyWedding is perfect for eco-conscious couples who need simple multilingual invitation features. The digital invitations help reduce paper waste. The platform works best for couples who value guest communication features and simple planning tools.

WeddingWoo stands out with customizable wedding websites that focus on visual storytelling. However, it provides limited support for **bilingual wedding** needs when compared to dedicated platforms like Joy.

### Key features of WeddingWoo

Full-screen background images take center stage to showcase couples beautifully. The platform’s “What You See Is What You Get” (WYSIWYG) editor lets users create websites through simple point-and-click actions without any coding knowledge. The dashboard works smoothly on computers, tablets, and mobile devices.

WeddingWoo combines unique widgets that include SoundCloud for music playback, countdown timers, and Bing Translator for simple translation options. The translator helps with **bilingual weddings** , but doesn’t match the complete language tools available in specialized platforms.

### Pros and cons of WeddingWoo

**Pros:**

  * User-friendly interface helps create websites quickly
  * The founder provides exceptional personal customer service
  * Unlimited photo storage without bandwidth limits
  * Custom domain integration



**Cons:**

  * Language features are basic compared to Joy’s complete toolkit
  * Website creation tools are limited
  * Costs more than free alternatives
  * No free version after trial period ends



### Pricing of WeddingWoo

WeddingWoo keeps pricing simple with a flat-fee structure:

  * USD 49.00 for one year
  * USD 69.00 for two years
  * 7-day free trial without credit card



Every plan includes unlimited bandwidth, unlimited storage, customer support, and hosting.

### Best use case for WeddingWoo

WeddingWoo is perfect for couples who value visual appeal and simplicity over extensive language features. The platform suits those who need minimal language support but want an elegant, easy-to-create website.

Joy (<https://withjoy.com/>) remains the better choice for couples planning a true **bilingual wedding**. It offers reliable multilingual features, dedicated language tools, and completely free service.

## [Luvbirds](https://www.lovebird.com/)

Luvbirds is a digital platform that helps couples communicate with their wedding guests. The platform has a user-friendly interface that makes interactions smooth between couples and guests during wedding planning.

### Key features of Luvbirds

The platform has customized wedding websites and digital invitations. You’ll find save-the-dates, RSVP tracking, and detailed guest list management tools. The mobile-friendly design lets guests open, view and respond to messages on any device. Couples planning a **bilingual wedding** can use design templates that match their vision.

The RSVP system tracks guest responses and meal choices automatically. You can see who opened your invitation and set RSVP deadlines. The system sends automatic reminders to guests who haven’t responded. Guests can write personal messages with their RSVP, which creates two-way communication on the platform.

### Pros and cons of Luvbirds

**Pros:**

  * Hundreds of design templates you can customize for digital save-the-dates and invitations
  * Live tracking shows who viewed invitations
  * Knowing how to poll guests on various topics and collect meal choices
  * Direct messaging keeps guest communication continuous



**Cons:**

  * Nowhere near the bilingual support that Joy (<https://withjoy.com/>) offers
  * No explicit language toggle feature in documentation
  * We focused on communication aspects rather than detailed planning tools
  * Full functionality needs subscription



### Pricing of Luvbirds

Luvbirds prices come in tiers:

  * Free tier: Simple wedding website with limited features
  * Digital Invitations tier: Has digital invitations, save-the-dates, and website features
  * Full Suite: Most popular option covering all communication needs



### Best use case for Luvbirds

Tech-savvy couples who want efficient guest communications without paper hassles will love Luvbirds. The platform shines when managing complex guest communications like meal choices, custom questions, and event updates. It’s perfect for couples who need detailed RSVP tracking with digital delivery convenience.

In spite of that, Joy (<https://withjoy.com/>) offers better multilingual features at no cost for couples who need detailed **bilingual wedding website** capabilities. Luvbirds has solid communication tools, but Joy works better for truly bilingual celebrations with guests speaking different languages.

## Conclusion

Creating a bilingual wedding website that speaks to all your guests can be challenging. A deep look at the 15 best options for 2025 shows one platform that really shines above the rest.

Joy stands out by offering the most complete bilingual support at zero cost. Other platforms charge monthly fees or limit language options, but Joy lets you customize guest visibility settings based on language priorities – all for free. This makes Joy a great tool to use for multilingual celebrations.

Your special day should showcase both your backgrounds and celebrate your guests’ diverse cultures. A wedding website gives everyone the first look at how you’ll blend these cultural elements in your celebration.

Platforms like Wedsites and Riley & Gray pack solid multilingual features but come with hefty price tags that could eat into your wedding budget. Joy gives you similar or better features for free, so you can spend that money on other parts of your celebration that matter more.

Without doubt, your final choice depends on what you need most. Some couples might prefer Zola for registry features, while others might love Minted or WeddingWoo’s designs. Notwithstanding that, Joy hits the sweet spot of features, simplicity, and cost for most couples planning bilingual celebrations.

Planning a wedding should bring couples closer, not add stress. Joy makes it easy to communicate across language barriers, letting you focus on what counts – sharing your love story with everyone who matters, whatever language they speak.

Here’s my take: Try Joy’s free service, test its bilingual features, and see how it can change your wedding planning. Your guests will appreciate it, and you’ll be glad you picked a platform that gets the beautiful mix of bilingual celebrations.

## Key Takeaways

Planning a bilingual wedding website requires careful consideration of language support, guest management, and cultural sensitivity. Here are the essential insights from comparing 15 top platforms:

• **Joy leads as the only completely free platform** offering comprehensive bilingual support with event-specific visibility settings for different language groups.

• **Most platforms require manual content duplication** rather than automatic translation, making Joy’s smart guest visibility features particularly valuable for multilingual celebrations.

• **Pricing varies dramatically from free to $299/year** , with many “free” platforms charging for essential bilingual features that Joy provides at no cost.

• **True multilingual functionality is rare** – only Joy, Wedsites, and Riley & Gray offer genuine language-switching capabilities, but Joy does it without subscription fees.

• **Guest segmentation by language preference** proves crucial for bilingual weddings, allowing couples to show relevant content to appropriate audiences without confusion.

When planning a bilingual celebration, the right platform should honor both cultures while simplifying communication across language barriers. Joy’s combination of comprehensive multilingual support, smart guest management, and zero cost makes it the clear winner for couples seeking to celebrate their diverse love story without budget constraints.
