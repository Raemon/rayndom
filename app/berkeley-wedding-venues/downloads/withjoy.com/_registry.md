## Frequently Asked Questions

Take a look at our most commonly asked questions and answers. For additional support chat with us.

How does Joy's zero fee cash gifting work?

We've integrated with your favorite cash-sharing services such as Venmo, PayPal, and Cash App, so that guests can easily and conveniently send funds to couples, without being charged a credit card processing fee or any other fee.

What should be on my wedding registry?

It all depends on what you need or want for your wedding or bridal registry. For instance, if you and your partner recently moved in together or bought a new house, your wish list may include a stand mixer, dinnerware, or kitchen gadgets. If you prefer cash gifts to have control over what to buy, you can set up a cash registry and link it to a goal such as a romantic honeymoon or a downpayment on your dream house. Whatever your preferences, be sure to briefly explain your reasoning in a note or on your wedding website.

When should we start our registry?

Itâs best to start your registry any time between the time you start wedding planning and about 4 months before your wedding day. Youâll likely want to set up your registry before sending out wedding invitations, as guests are likely to want to know by that time.

How many gifts should we register for?

When creating your wedding registry, youâll want to give guests plenty of options, so the best bet is to register for more gifts than you have guests. For example, in a wedding with 90 guests you would want to have at least 100 registry items. You can build registries with multiple brands like Amazon, Bed Bath & Beyond, Crate & Barrel, and Williams-Sonoma, and then sync them all to your Joy registry for an easier guest shopping experience.

How can I explain to my guests that we are using a cash registry?

For your family and friends who are more used to gift registries, itâs helpful to include a note explaining what their cash gift will go towards and expressing your gratitude for any amount they are able to give.

Is it rude to ask for money instead of wedding gifts?

Not at all! In fact, in many places outside of the US, itâs common (and sometimes expected) to give money in lieu of traditional gifts. In recent years, cash gifting has become more and more popular in the US, as a way of elevating experiences instead of accumulating things, thanks in part to the emergence of cash registry platforms such as Joy and Honeyfund. Check out our article [Cash Wedding Registries: An Introductory Guide](https://withjoy.com/blog/cash-wedding-registries-guide/) for best practices on how to navigate the cash ask on your wedding website.

How many types of wedding registries should I have?

Itâs always good to give your loved ones plenty of gift ideas. Some wedding guests may be uncomfortable with the idea of giving money, so itâs best to include the option of a wedding gift registry as well. 

Can I send thank-you notes through Joy?

Yes! Joy allows you to keep track of who has given a gift and send guests personalized messages.

How to make a wedding registry with Joy?

Creating a wedding registry may seem like a daunting task, especially when youâre already busy planning your wedding and juggling numerous other responsibilities. However, donât fret! Building your registry with Joy is incredibly simple. Once youâve registered, all you need to do is visit our shop and start adding gifts.   
Keep in mind that you can also include gifts from your favorite stores or even replicate any registries youâve created with other companies. Additionally, you have the option to add gifts from your friendsâ registries, making the process even more convenient and personalized.

What should we include in our wedding registry checklist?

Thereâs no need for you to create a wedding registry checklist. Joy offers you a Registry Checklist so you donât forget to add any of the things youâll need for this new chapter of your life. Of course, what youâll need depends on your lifestyle and preferences. A couple who is moving into a new space for the first time together will likely have a different registry than a couple who is planning to travel the world.   
A good way to start your registry is to begin choosing essentials for your new life together, such as kitchen gadgets, home essentials, and linens. Remember to include a variety of items from different price ranges to accommodate all your guestsâ budgets. Additionally, consider adding cash funds for future plans and charitable donations to infuse your registry with meaning. Experiences are another fantastic addition, allowing you to create memories that will last a lifetime. Ultimately, your registry should serve as a reflection of your needs and desires, ensuring that your loved ones can support you in various ways as you embark on this new journey together. By curating a diverse selection of gifts, youâll provide your guests with ample options to choose from, ensuring a memorable and enjoyable gift-giving experience.

How many gifts should we put on our wedding registry?

While thereâs no specific number of gifts you should aim for on your wedding registry, itâs generally advisable to have more items than guests. This approach ensures that your registry offers a diverse range of options, accommodating various preferences and budgets. To assist you in determining the ideal number of gifts, Joy provides a convenient Registry Calculator tool. Simply input your guest count, and the tool will recommend a suitable number of gifts for your registry, ensuring balance across different price ranges. This proactive approach simplifies the gift selection process for your guests and helps you create a comprehensive registry that aligns with your needs and preferences. Whether youâre seeking household essentials, cash funds, or memorable experiences, a diverse selection ensures that your registry reflects your unique personality and desires.   
Additionally, take advantage of our 20% Registry Completion Discount on items remaining in your registry after your special day. Consider adding items you definitely want to have to enjoy them later at a discounted price.

When should you start a wedding registry?

You can start your registry whenever you like, but we recommend creating your wedding registry approximately 8-9 months before your wedding date. This timeframe allows you to thoughtfully curate your registry, selecting items that suit your lifestyle and preferences. Moreover, starting early gives your guests ample time to browse and choose the perfect gifts, ensuring a stress-free and enjoyable shopping experience for everyone involved. Finalizing your registry before sending out shower or wedding invitations is essential, as it allows your guests to plan and purchase their gifts in advance. By beginning the registry process well in advance, you eliminate any last-minute rushing and ensure that your registry accurately reflects your needs and desires as you embark on this exciting new chapter of your life together.

With its seamless interface and comprehensive features, Joy ensures that the registry process is enjoyable, convenient, and memorable for both couples and their loved ones.

What is the difference between a bridal registry and a wedding registry?

Well, thereâs no real difference between a bridal registry and a wedding registry. Itâs just a matter of framing. Traditionally, women were more often involved in creating the registries, and thatâs why the name became attributed to the bride. But today, we know a wedding is a joint venture, where it is common not only for both partners to create their registries together but also for the titles 'groom' and 'bride' to be irrelevant in many cases.

Why create a wedding registry?

Creating a wedding registry offers numerous benefits for both couples and their guests. While itâs true that friends and family may want to purchase gifts regardless of whether a registry exists, having one ensures that couples receive items, experiences, or cash fund contributions that align with their needs and preferences. A wedding registry serves as a helpful guide for guests, directing them toward gifts that the couple will genuinely appreciate and use.   
Additionally, by creating a registry, couples can avoid receiving duplicate or impractical gifts, ensuring that every gift contributes to their future together. Furthermore, a wedding registry allows couples to express their unique personalities and aspirations, whether through selecting household items, planning experiences, or supporting charitable causes. Ultimately, creating a wedding registry is a win-win situation for both couples and their guests, facilitating a meaningful and enjoyable gift-giving experience that celebrates the coupleâs love and journey together.

How to craft the perfect Wedding Registry with Joy?

Congratulations on your engagement! Now, let's talk about that ever-so-important task on your to-do list: creating your wedding registry. We know it may seem like an overwhelming task at first, but fear notâwith a little bit of guidance and a whole lot of enthusiasm, we're here to make it a seamless experience for you.  
Meet Joy, your partner for this registry adventure. Think of it as creating your ultimate wish list for this new chapter of your lives together. We've got you covered, from kitchen gadgets that'll make you feel like a pro chef to cozy throws that'll turn your Netflix nights into a snuggle fest.  
Creating a wedding registry It's not just about ticking off items; it's about infusing your personalities, quirks, and dreams into every choice you make. This is the perfect time to dream up your ideal home together.  
With Joy, it's all about making this process fun and stress-free. So, go ahead, dream big, get creative, and let's make this wedding registry reflect your unique love story.  
  
**Starting your registry**  
We recommend starting your registry about 8-9 months before your big day. This gives you ample time to curate a wishlist that truly reflects the style you want for this new chapter in your life.  
Once you've set up your registry, it's time to dive into the good stuff: adding your wedding gifts. Our user-friendly interface makes browsing and adding gifts super easy. In the Joy Shop, you can add from kitchen essentials that'll turn you into a culinary wizard to Zero-Fee Cash Funds to make that dreamed honeymoon come true. Everything is possible.  
But thatâs not all. Joy lets you add gifts from your favorite shops, so your dreams are not confined to just our shop. You can literally add anything from any website you want. With Universal Search, you can add anything in one place. You can even replicate registries from elsewhere. We recently developed a new tool that lets you add gifts from a friendâs registry. So, if you have friends who recently married and you like their style, they can share their registry link with you, and you can mimic that registry and customize it to perfection.  
Now, you might be wondering, "Where do we even begin?". The answer might be easier than you think. At Joy, we've got your back with our Registry Checklist tool, ensuring no essential item gets left behind. From practical kitchen gadgets to luxurious linens, the world is yours.   
  
When deciding how many gifts to include on your wedding registry, we suggest adding more items than the number of guests to ensure everyone discovers something theyâd love to gift to you. Remember to cater to varying budgets by including a range of gift options. You can use our Registry Calculator tool to achieve the perfect balance. We also invite you to include all the items you genuinely cherish on your registry, as we offer a 20% Newlywed Discount that can be applied to any remaining items after your wedding.  
  
Your registry is a reflection of your unique journey together. Embrace diversity by including gifts that celebrate your passions and shared adventures. Whether you're foodies, travel enthusiasts, or eco-conscious warriors, let your registry tell your story. Experiences like cooking classes or a weekend getaway can create lasting memories. Cash funds for your dream honeymoon or a down payment on your first home add practicality to your registry. And let's not forget about charitable donations â a meaningful way to give back and spread love on your special day.  
  
**A seamless experience for your guests**  
With Joy, your guests can enjoy one seamless checkout experience. You can customize your own wedding registry site and let guests shop everything in one place.   
They also receive live support every step of the way.  
Your online Wedding Registry is the ultimate guide for your guests, ensuring their gifts hit the markâno more awkward encounters with duplicate toasters. And unlike most wedding registry websites, guests donât need an account to purchase with Joy.  
Plus, it's a chance to infuse your registry with personal touches, from cherished experiences to charitable deeds. It's a win-win for all involved.  
Thanks to Group Gifting, your guests can also chip in together to get you something special. You choose the gift they can share, and they simply contribute the exact amount they want.  
  
As much as your registry is about receiving, it's also about giving. Encourage your guests to explore the registry with joy and excitement. After all, their contributions will play a part in shaping your future. And remember, every gift, big or small, is a token of love and support from those closest to you.  
  
**Joy goes above and beyond**  
Joy is constantly adding new features and tools to make your wedding registry fun and easy. We offer a seamless shopping experience with free shipping on all orders over $45 and hassle-free returns for you and your guests on all items purchased on the Joy Shop. You can also swap gifts for cash on all items you add to your registry from other stores, such as Amazon or Crate and Barrel.  
Another Joy-only feature is the possibility to ship when you want, so you wonât miss that package while youâre honeymooning.  
  
Crafting your wedding registry is more than just compiling a list of gifts â it's a journey filled with excitement, anticipation, and love. With Joy as your companion, you'll easily navigate this process, creating a registry that reflects your unique personalities and dreams for the future. Your wedding registry search ends here. Here's to your happily ever after!

  * Allison & Benjaminâs Wedding Registry

In January 2021, in the midst of a global pandemic, two adventurous souls found themselves drawn together by a shared love for bouldering. Meet Ally and Ben, whose serendipitous meeting at the Hive Climbing Gym would set the stage for a love story that would potentially go down as the greatest in Canadian history (no bias, of course).One fateful afternoon, Allison, a full-time career gal with a love for bouldering, found herself at the climbing gym. She navigated the colourful holds and challenging routes with grace and determination. Little did she know that her path would soon intersect with that of Ben, a regular climber who was a full-time University student squeezing the most out of his flexible schedule to work on a challenging route in the early afternoon.Ben attempted a difficult new route in which he fell off and instantly hurt his left ring finger. Unknowingly, Allison encouraged him on his attempt. Captivated by her enthusiasm (and bright blue âwhite walkerâ eyes) Ben couldnât resist striking up a conversation. They got to talking, and talking turned into an hour. Before parting ways, Allison gave Ben her number in hopes to have a new âclimbing buddyâ. But to both of their excitement, their chemistry ignited a spark for which friendship just would not do.Their friendship and connection grew stronger with each shared adventure, and it wasnât long before they realized they had found something special in each other. Despite the challenges of the pandemic, Ben and Ally were creative in dates from ocean side walks, hammocking in the forest, to homemade pizza nights in.After laughing through two years as partners in crime, these two adventurers recognized this was the adventure to commit their lives to.

  * Thomas & Bryanaâs Wedding Registry

The first time we met, we were both playing a riveting game of âTitanicâ in one of those team-building exercises that we all know and love. I remember thinking, well if Iâm stuck on a doomed ship, being stuck with her wouldnât be so badâwe both ended up drowned. Then a few months later I began flirting with her. âHeyâ I would say and then I would wonder why she wasnât picking up what I was putting down. Eventually, I decided that I would need to up my game, so under the guise of planning a friendâs going away party, we set off to venture for a pinata. One party planning venture, a trip to REI, many walks later, and I find myself about to embark on the next adventure with the most beautiful, smart, and amazing woman Iâve ever met.

-Thomas

  * Taylor & Efeâs Wedding Registry

It was a beautiful day in August of 2018, and Taylor was at Pickles Pub across from Camden Yards with her friends Erin and Anthony. Taylor was being set up with their friend Dylan. She was quite recently single and was only allowing this setup to happen to appease her friend Erin.

Pano to Efe: Dylan told Efe that he had an extra ticket to the Orioles game (Taylorâs ticket) and invited him to join. Right before they arrive to Pickles, Dylan turns to Efe, explains heâs being set up, and tells Efe heâs not interested (Taylorâs Facebook profile was lackluster it seems.) But when they both see Taylor, Dylan trys to take it back. They both talk over each other trying to buy Taylor drinks, which continues throughout the Orioles game.

What Dylan didnât know was that he had lost the moment Taylor saw Efe. Green eyes and black hair, totally her type. And heâs Turkish! How interesting! The five of them spent the whole day together, as baseball games are rather long. The fact that both Efe and Taylor were around their friends made it apparent that they were being their authentic selves, and so Taylor was blunt and Efe was silly. At dinner at the end of the day, Efe slid a napkin across the table, asking Taylor for her number :)

The next day, Efe told his friend Conor, âI really hope it works out with this girl!â

  * Makeya & BreâKeanâs Wedding Registry

Ken and I were invited to an event to celebrate someone we love. I arrived at the event first and became acquainted with my friendâs family, a.k .a. his family. Little did I, or shall I say we, know that My friendâs family was playing matchmakers, and when Breâkean arrived, we were both strongly encouraged to speak. We had small conversations, and then it was time for me to leave.

However, as you may know, when we make plans, God laughs because as I was trying to leave, my tire caught a flat, and BreâKean put on the spare and made sure I got home safely. Our story continued, and for a few weeks, we dated and had long conversations, and both realized that we wanted to be together. So, we made it official!

  * Morgan & Grayâs Wedding Registry

Gray and Morgan met on November 19, 2021, at an engagement party on Folly Beach. Gray attended the University of South Carolina with the future groom, and Morgan went to Clemson University with the future bride (thank you, Brunsons!).

Morgan briefly talked to Gray at the party, then a few days passed, and she decided to follow him on Instagram (she thought he was super cute, so why not?). He immediately reached out to her, and the rest is history.

Their first date was Downtown Charleston at Barsa on December 1, 2021. After dinner, the two grabbed espresso martinis at Vintage Lounge for dessert.

On December 24, 2023 (Christmas Eve!), Gray proposed at Morganâs Nana and Papaâs house (her momâs parents) in front of her family.

To give a glimpse of Grayâs heart, as they headed back to Morganâs parentsâ house that day, with tears in his eyes, Gray told her that he knew he wanted to propose in front of her family because ever since the first time he met them, they have always made him feel like family.

Morgan thanks God every day for bringing Gray into her life. He is proof that God always gives us His very best, and she couldnât be more grateful that she gets to love him forever.

  * Katie & Ryanâs Wedding Registry

We first met in the most magical place on earth--Bumble, where the woman is forced to make the first move. As Katie continued to make the big moves, Ryan stayed along for the ride as he always does. From our first date at Cityside in Brighton, we both knew that our bond over dogs, 90s music, good food, and the Great British Bake off could lead to something more than just a first date. After that, we were inseparable and there was never a question about spending the rest of our lives together. Weâve raised a dog, grieved together, traveled across the world, fallen in love, and moved in together, but we are most excited to get married and spend the rest of our lives together.

  * Darya & Jesseâs Wedding Registry

Darya and Jesse met in the summer of 2016. Jesse was having a BBQ at his house in Felton and Darya stopped by with a mutual friend.

They started talking and connected over their shared love of art and music. As fate would have it, not only did they live close to one another, but they worked just one block apart in downtown Santa Cruz

Darya often went to New Leaf Market, where Jesse worked, on her lunch break. Theyâd wave to each other in the check out line and it wasnât long before they took their friendship to the next level. Their first date was at Montyâs Log Cabin, a favorite local dive bar in the redwoods

As their relationship grew they moved into their first apartment together, traveled to new places, and adopted their first puppy named Scout.

Some of their favorite travel memories together have been riding bikes through tulip fields in Amsterdam, and traveling by camper van to hike the red rocks of Sedona, Arizona.

Jesse received his masters degree from CSUMB and started his teaching career at Watsonville Highschool while Darya started medical assisting at the Capitola Health Center, and found her passion in creating stained glass art

On their 6 year anniversary, they took a ride up the coast on Jesseâs motorcycle and had a picnic overlooking the Pacific Ocean. Jesse got down on one knee and proposed to Darya at sunset. She, of course, said "YES!"
