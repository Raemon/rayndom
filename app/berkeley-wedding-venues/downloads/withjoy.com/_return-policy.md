Returns & Exchanges

Last Updated: September 12, 2024

We always strive to deliver Joy, but in case you’d like to return or exchange an item, here are the details.

Purchases on Joy

When you purchase a gift on our site, you're buying the equivalent in Joy Credit, which is equal to the full price of the item at the time of purchase, including taxes and shipping. The gift recipient can use that value to have the selected item shipped at their convenience. If the item's price increases after purchase or during a shipping hold, we’ll cover the difference. They can also choose to apply that value toward a different item on Joy.

  * **Joy Credit** never expires and can be used on physical products and experiences sold by Joy. You cannot use credit for cash gifts, honeymoon funds, digital gift cards, or items from other websites. It also cannot be applied to past orders. Promo codes may be offered occasionally and may have expiration dates or additional terms and conditions.
  * We reserve the right to cancel or decline to process orders for reasons such as pricing errors, concerns about fraud, or out-of-stock items. If that happens, you will not be charged, or we’ll issue a refund.
  * We accept returns on select items; please refer to our Return Policy below for details. While we strive to provide accurate product information, we can’t guarantee all content is error-free. If something is incorrect, your primary option will be to return the item.
  * Occasionally, product listings may be outdated or inaccurate. We reserve the right to update or correct information without notice and may cancel orders placed at incorrect prices.
  * By purchasing or registering for an item on our site, you agree to our shipping and return policies. We don’t sell alcohol, but some third-party gift cards may be redeemable for alcohol from other sellers. You must be at least 21 years of age to purchase these products and comply with all applicable state laws.



Registry Purchases

Most items can be returned within 90 days. Don’t worry! If you’re returning a gift that was purchased for you, the gift giver will not be notified.

  * You must request a return or exchange no more than 90 days after your event OR no more than 90 days after purchase, whichever date is later. There are no exceptions.
  * In order for eligible item(s) to be returned, proof of purchase is required and returned item(s) must be in the same condition received, unopened, unused, and in the original packaging.
  * You’ll be issued a refund in the form of a merchandise credit in the amount of the full value originally paid, less any shipping and restocking fees if applicable.
  * If the item was purchased through a Third Party’s website, for example, Amazon.com or Target.com, that store’s return policy applies. Any return, refund, or exchange should be handled directly by the retailer from where the item was purchased.
  * Please note: Joy retains the right to review and/or deny any return request on a case-by-case basis.



Printed Cards and Paper

We want you to be 100% happy with your prints. That’s why each order has a 24 hour window to make any last minute changes, be it a typo, updated shipping address, or other minor change. Simply reach out to our customer support team at printsupport@withjoy.com with your change or cancellation request.

Given that each paper order is custom printed to your specifications, all sales are final after the 24-hour grace period.

If an error was detected after the 24-hour grace period, you may reach out to our customer support team at printsupport@withjoy.com, and our agents will review your request on a case-by-case basis.

In the rare event that a printing issue affected your order, please reach out to our customer support team at printsupport@withjoy.com with the following information:

  * Name
  * Order number
  * Brief description of the issue
  * Photo showing the issue and how many items were impacted



If we determine that there is a quality issue with our printing process, we will refund your order or reprint free of charge.

All Other Purchases

Most items can be returned within 30 days.

  * An order may be canceled provided the item hasn’t shipped yet.
  * If the item has already shipped, you must request a refund or exchange no more than 30 days after purchase. There are no exceptions.
  * If the item was purchased through a Third Party’s website, for example, Amazon.com or Target.com, that store’s return policy applies. Any return, refund, or exchange should be handled directly by the retailer from where the item was purchased.



Refund Policy

In order for the eligible item(s) to be refunded, you must ensure that:

  * Returned item(s) must be in the same condition received, unopened, unused, and in the original packaging.
  * Proof of purchase is provided.
  * Please note: Joy retains the right to review and/or deny any return request on a case-by-case basis.



Proof of purchase is required to issue an appropriate exchange, credit, or refund of an eligible item(s), as well as any taxes due to be refunded in accordance with applicable state law. For your convenience, any of the following is accepted as proof of your purchase:

  * Gift Receipt
  * eReceipt
  * Original Packing Slip
  * Gift Packing Slip
  * Order Number
  * Gift Registry Number



There are a few items that can’t be returned:

  * Opened and assembled furniture items
  * Gift cards and eGift cards
  * Redeemed experiences
  * Personalized items or custom orders
  * Shipping fees, if applicable, are non-refundable



Restocking fees may apply to certain items:

  * Any restocking fee will be deducted from your refund total once the return has been processed.



Experiences

Joy partners with third-party providers to offer our registrants a wide variety of experiences and event ticket options.

  * Unredeemed experiences can be returned for a merchandise credit but are not eligible for a refund.
  * Third-party providers offer site-specific return policies. Gifts purchased through a third party are subject to those policies, if applicable.
  * Spur offers cash back refunds up to 30 days after the purchase on un-redeemed experiences.
  * After 30 days, customers can exchange experiences for credit to their e-wallet. These funds never expire and can be used towards other Spur experiences as well as tickets to sporting events and concerts. Experience vouchers never expire. However, some experience providers may change their offerings over time. If the experience is no longer offered, the total amount of the voucher will be credited to the user’s e-wallet. Spur’s full policy details can be viewed here. <https://spurexperiences.com/terms-conditions>



Third Party and External Items

Joy’s registry platform allows registrants to add items from other stores so they can manage their registry all in one place. If you’d like to return or exchange an item purchased through a third party, please be aware that:

  * Items purchased from other websites are subject to the return policy of the store from which they were purchased.
  * Any customer service inquiry, return, refund, or exchange for these items should be handled directly by the retailer from where the item was purchased.



Delivery Issues

If an item is damaged upon delivery:

  * Contact customer service within 30 days of delivery.
  * A photo of the damaged item and any packaging in the order must be provided in order to process any requests.
  * A replacement or merchandise credit will be issued.



If an item is defective:

  * Contact customer service within 90 days of delivery and provide a photo of any visible defects and any information pertaining to the issue, regular care and use, and any possible troubleshooting of the issue.
  * For all other defective items, please refer to the manufacturer’s warranty.
  * If a replacement is not desired, the value of the item will be issued as a merchandise credit.



If an item is lost or missing in transit:

  * Contact customer service within 14 days of scheduled delivery.
  * After 14 days, your order may not be able to be replaced.



For back ordered items, including items that were purchased and are no longer available or items delayed from the manufacturer:

  * You may cancel the order prior to the item being shipped.
  * A merchandise credit will be issued for the full value paid less any fees, if applicable.
  * A replacement item of equal or greater value may be offered in certain circumstances.
