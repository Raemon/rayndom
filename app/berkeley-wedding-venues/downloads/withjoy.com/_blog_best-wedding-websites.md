**Our take:**

Appy Couple functions as a personalized app for your wedding guests to use that syncs with your website. It charges $12/month (or $49 per year) but has top-notch guest communication capabilities and photo-sharing options. Guests can upload and share photos on the app in real time during your wedding, which you can live stream on the website. 

There’s a unique family-group RSVP option where any member of the group can RSVP for everyone. It also lets you set language preferences and multiple co-administrators, such as wedding planners, to help with coordination. The app serves as a digital guest book and keepsake of all your memories.

**Our take:**

Riley & Grey offers unique wedding website templates outside of the general styles. It’s a paid tool, a one-time payment of $35 or membership options of $35/month or $240/year, but it is far more advanced than other platforms in terms of design.

### **WedSites: Best event management**

**Key features:** Drag-and-drop tools, language translation

**Why Couples Love It:** | **Considerations:**  
---|---  
• Advanced planning features   
• Preferred language/ translation setup| • No wedding registry, can only include an external link

![](https://withjoy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/wedsites-1024x683.jpg)![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201024%20683%22%3E%3C/svg%3E) _Photo Source:_ [ _WedSites_](https://wedsites.com/)

**Our take:**

This Australian-based platform lets you create and personalize a wedding website from its vast suite of templates. WedSite’s drag-and-drop features make customization easy. It also serves as a dedicated place for your wedding event planning, where you can build your own guest list database, [create a wedding checklist](https://withjoy.com/blog/wedding-planning-timeline/), use a budget calculator, and more. 

Send trackable, matching save-the-dates and invitations digitally, as well as add your own RSVP questions to the website to streamline communication with your guests. WedSites does require an upgrade to one of its paid plans for full access to tools and features.

## **How We Chose Our Top Picks**

Many general website builders out there with wedding themes, but their wedding planning tools and services fall short of industry standards. For this reason, we reached our final nine using the following criteria: 

  * **Ease of use:** The most user-friendly setup process, templates, and features 
  * **Reviews & ratings:** Most recommended and praised by customers and wedding planners
  * **Customization:** A variety of [wedding template designs](https://withjoy.com/blog/creative-wedding-website-examples/) and custom domain options
  * **Fees:** Mostly free to use with reasonable fees for additional features
  * **Security:** Password-protection option for privacy and guest-only access



## **Choosing the Best Wedding Website for You**

Most wedding platforms with custom websites will have overlapping offerings, so it really boils down to what is most important to individual couples. Here are key factors to look for and [include on your wedding website](https://withjoy.com/blog/wedding-website-tips/) to ensure the platform you choose meets your specific needs.

### **Customization features**

The functionality and design of available website templates will either add to or reduce time spent on planning. Prioritize those with drag-and-drop features and optimized for mobile use to ensure design isn’t compromised. 

### **Perks and services**

While some websites lack one feature, they may make up for it in other services that you and your partner deem beneficial. Consider any discounts and rewards for using the platform, such as for venue and hotel bookings, and wedding websites offering free, matching save-the-dates and invitations (both digital and print).

### **Free vs. premium options**

If you have a [budget for the wedding](https://withjoy.com/blog/quick-guide-to-setting-wedding-budget/), weigh your options on what services and tools you’ll need to streamline communication for guests. In some cases, wedding websites that offer the most free features may make more sense.

When budget and personalization are your deal-breakers, Joy’s zero-fee platform can’t be beat. From the universal registry down to guest contributions, there are no additional (or hidden) fees to worry about. Create and integrate your custom wedding website and registry, all using our user-friendly app. With all-in-one planning tools, Joy makes it easy.
