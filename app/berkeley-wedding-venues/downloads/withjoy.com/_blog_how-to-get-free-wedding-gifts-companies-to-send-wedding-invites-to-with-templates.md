My partner and I found this exciting trend that many couples now follow. Sending wedding invitations to your favorite brands could lead to amazing surprises. Mickey and Minnie from Disney might send you their wedding wishes – a special keepsake you’ll love displaying in your home. Southwest Airlines often responds with honeymoon travel vouchers. Many couples have received delightful responses from In-N-Out Burger too.

Disney sends customized cards and stickers, while Chick-fil-A has become a TikTok sensation by sending boxes filled with pre-wedding treats. You might get lucky with Ben & Jerry’s – they sometimes send vouchers for free ice cream instead of their usual cookbook!

We’ll share our best recommendations about which companies to include in your wedding invitation list, plus templates that will help you create attention-grabbing invites. Those extra wedding invitations could turn into unexpected treasures for your special day!

## Why People Send Wedding Invites to Companies

Couples have started a popular tradition of sending wedding invitations to their favorite companies. This practice means more than just getting free stuff—it builds meaningful connections and creates lasting memories. Here are the main reasons this trend keeps growing.

### To celebrate brand loyalty

Couples send wedding invitations to brands that mean something special in their relationship. Your first date might have involved sharing a particular brand’s product, or a specific company might have been part of your life together.

To name just one example, couples send invitations to companies whose products were there during big moments—maybe you got engaged at a favorite restaurant chain, or you both loved the same ice cream brand. This gesture lets couples show how certain brands have become part of their relationship story.

We send these invitations to include companies that played supporting roles in your love story. A brand that has been there through your relationship milestones deserves a symbolic invite to your wedding.

### To receive free wedding gifts or coupons

Without doubt, couples send wedding invitations to companies because they might get free items in return. Many businesses respond with thoughtful gifts or discount offers.

The potential rewards from companies can include:

  * Personalized congratulatory letters
  * Gift cards or discount coupons
  * Branded merchandise like mugs or t-shirts
  * Product samples or full-sized products
  * Recipe books or collectible items



Then, this practice adds meaningful elements to your wedding experience without hurting your budget. Companies see this as a chance to build goodwill while getting promotional benefits. They know that positive responses to wedding invitations create loyal customers who will share stories about the company’s generosity.

### To create fun memories and keepsakes

Beyond material gifts, sending [wedding](https://withjoy.com/) invitations to favorite companies creates special memories and keepsakes from your wedding experience. The responses become tangible mementos that mark your special day in surprising ways.

Getting a package from a beloved brand with a personal note about your marriage creates an exciting surprise worth keeping. These responses often become treasured keepsakes that couples display at home or put in wedding scrapbooks.

The whole experience adds excitement and fun to wedding planning. Those extra invitations become potential connections with favorite brands and add a playful touch to wedding preparations.

Companies might not always respond, but sending invitations to meaningful brands creates its own special memory. Partners share another experience together—picking which companies to include, writing personal notes about why each brand matters, and checking the mail with excitement.

This tradition makes wedding planning a more personal experience that shows your unique relationship story and the brands that helped write it.

## Top Companies to Send Wedding Invites to for Free Stuff

Want to get free [wedding gifts](https://withjoy.com/blog/wedding-gift-ideas/) from your favorite brands? Here’s a list of companies that love to send surprises when you invite them to your wedding. Each brand celebrates your big day differently, so grab those extra invitations and start mailing!

### 1\. Disney

Disney adds a magical touch to your special day with gifts that you’ll treasure forever. Send your invitation to **The Walt Disney Company, Attn: Fan Mail Department, 500 South Buena Vista Street, Burbank, CA 91521, USA**. Most couples get tailored cards from Mickey and Minnie with stickers, pins, and other magical goodies. You can also mail to Walt Disney World Communications, P.O. Box 10040, Lake Buena Vista, Florida 32830.

### 2\. Ben & Jerry’s

Good news for ice cream lovers! Ben & Jerry’s loves to send vouchers for free ice cream pints. Mail your invitation to **Ben & Jerry’s, Attn: Customer Service, 530 Community Drive, Suite 1, South Burlington, VT 05403, USA**. They offer ice cream catering for weddings and send sweet notes with discount coupons to help you celebrate your new life together.

### 3\. Chick-fil-A

Chick-fil-A has become a TikTok sensation because of their wedding gifts. Send your invitation to **Chick-fil-A, Inc., Attn: CARES, P.O. Box 725489, Atlanta, GA 31139-9923, USA**. Couples often get cute boxes with insulated cups, wearable swag, keychains, and free food passes. Some lucky pairs have gotten tote bags, socks, and stuffed cow mascots. All the same, responses vary, so show your genuine love for the brand.

### 4\. Crumbl Cookies

Crumbl, famous for their weekly cookie flavors, sends cookie coupons for two and handwritten notes. Mail your invitation to **Crumbl, 2570 W 600 N, Lindon, UT 84042, USA**. This sweet response means more especially when you have shared Crumbl dates during your relationship.

### 5\. Southwest Airlines

Ready to plan your [honeymoon](https://withjoy.com/blog/how-long-the-average-honeymoon-lasts/)? Send your invitation to **Southwest Airlines, P.O. Box 36647-1CR, Dallas, TX 75235, USA**. Southwest might surprise you with free travel vouchers, card decks, champagne bottles, or seat upgrades. Your chances of getting travel perks increase when you mention your upcoming honeymoon or bachelorette trip.

### 6\. In-N-Out Burger

West Coast burger lovers should mail an invitation to **In-N-Out Burgers, Attn: Customer Service, 4199 Campus Drive, 9th Floor, Irvine, CA 92612, USA**. This favorite chain often sends meal vouchers, stickers, hats, t-shirts, gift cards, and congratulatory letters. Many couples have gotten amazing tailored responses from this classic burger spot.

### 7\. The Mets

Baseball fans should try sending an invitation to **The Mets, Citi Field, 41 Seaver Way, Queens, NY 11368, USA**. The New York team often sends gifts, notes, and wedding bobbleheads to fans. One couple got a special bobblehead and letter after inviting the team’s owners to their wedding.

### 8\. Red Bull

Need a boost for your big day? Mail an invitation to **Red Bull, 1740 Stewart St, Santa Monica, CA 90404**. You might get some energy drink cans with thank-you notes to keep you energized during your wedding celebrations.

Send your invitations early with a return address. A personal message increases your chances of getting responses from these companies.

## How to Write and Personalize Your Wedding Invite

A company wedding invitation needs more than a basic invite. Your personalized touch will catch attention and boost your chances of getting a gift back. Here’s how to make your invitations stand out to your favorite brands.

### Include a photo using the brand’s product

A visual connection with companies boosts your chances of getting a response. Here are some approaches to try:

Add a high-quality photo that shows you and your partner enjoying the company’s products or services. You could wear their apparel, pose in front of their store, or use their products in special moments. To cite an instance, see how an invitation to Southwest Airlines could include a picture from your memorable trip on their planes.

These photos show real proof of your connection to the brand. Companies love seeing their products blend into customers’ important life moments. Your photo that features their product creates an [emotional connection](https://withjoy.com/blog/27-time-tested-relationship-advice-for-couples-from-50-year-marriages/?srsltid=AfmBOor59Uvvsyd5W2GjoBt5ZQZp5jqBzZrkAIBwaBTCWnXSbZsEZzi2) and can inspire them to respond with generosity.

### Mention why the brand is meaningful to you

Your personal story builds an emotional bond that moves companies to respond. Include a handwritten note that explains:

  * How the company shaped your relationship
  * Special memories with their products or services
  * Your favorite items from their lineup (favorite cookie flavor, fishing bait, tractor model, etc.)
  * How their brand became part of your relationship story



Authenticity makes all the difference. Companies can spot real fans from those who just want free stuff. Specific details about why you love their brand prove your genuine connection and loyalty.

### Add your social media handles (optional)

Your social media information can hint at the promotional value of sending you a gift. This works especially when you have:

  * Many followers
  * A track record of sharing brand experiences online
  * Plans to document wedding gifts from companies



This approach is “a sneaky way of showing the brand that a wedding gift could work to their advantage”. When they send wedding goodies and you share them on TikTok or Instagram, it creates natural brand promotion that helps everyone.

Your invitation should stay polite and respectful, whatever personalization techniques you choose. Note that these companies get many requests. A thoughtful personal touch in yours can boost your chances of getting a meaningful response by a lot.

## How to Send Wedding Invites to Companies

After you’ve personalized your [wedding invitations](https://withjoy.com/blog/the-best-wedding-invitation-sites/?srsltid=AfmBOopxxL5C2FxwAeGkcdHE8NgtXLuT6KyVDTDo6xbo8l1-GbDPeR7r), you need to make sure they get to the right place. Sending invites to companies needs careful attention and perfect timing to get the best possible response rate.

### Find the correct mailing address

The right address is your starting point for successful company outreach. Your first stop should be the company’s official website – look for their “Contact Us” page where you’ll usually find mailing details. This way, your invitation will reach their headquarters or customer relations team.

You can also check their social media profiles where smaller businesses often post their physical addresses. Product packaging can be helpful too – just look for return addresses or customer service details if you’ve bought from them before.

Need more options? Here’s what you can do:

  * Send a direct message through their social media accounts
  * Look them up on Google Maps or Yelp
  * Search for corporate headquarters info on their business websites



Disney wedding invitations need a specific address: “The Walt Disney Company, Attn: Fan Mail Department, 500 South Buena Vista Street, Burbank, CA 91521, USA”.

### Use proper formatting and labeling

Your invitation’s journey to the right department depends on how well you address it. Target specific departments like Public Relations, Customer Service, or Fan Mail instead of using generic addresses.

Make your envelope easy to read. Put the company name first, add the department (like “Attn: Customer Relations”), and finish with the complete address. This will help your invitation stand out from regular mail.

Quality materials matter for your mailing package. These company invitations deserve the same attention as the ones you send to wedding guests.

### Send early to allow time for response

The timing of your invitations can make or break your success with companies. Mail them at least 3-4 months before your wedding date to give brands enough time to respond.

Companies often work with limited promotional budgets that might run low as the year goes on. Early invitations have a better chance of catching them before their goodwill budgets run dry.

The time of year matters too. Brands tend to be more responsive during holidays, engagement season, or their company anniversaries. This could boost your chances of getting wedding gifts.

## Tips to Increase Your Chances of Getting a Response

You’ll want to maximize your chances of getting those coveted wedding gifts after selecting your favorite companies to invite. These strategic tips can change your ordinary invitation into one that grabs a brand’s attention.

### Be genuine and specific

[Tailoring your invitation](https://withjoy.com/blog/wedding-invite-ideas-2025/?srsltid=AfmBOorVIJmz_INeC8cmf0M3GAJ5lt8mT0WZcf2tiXzIJ7wp3UT7mp8G) to each recipient makes a huge difference in response rates. Your message should explain why you chose them and what their acknowledgment means to you. Smart companies quickly spot the difference between real fans and people just looking for free stuff. Share your personal connection to their products. Maybe their ice cream was part of your first date, or you got engaged after flying with their airline. Real stories like these create emotional bonds that inspire companies to respond with gifts.

### Use high-quality invitation paper

Content matters but presentation creates the first impression. Companies judge invitations similar to resumes, so quality paper and professional design make a difference. Premium materials show you value their time and attention. Companies get hundreds of requests each month. Quality paper helps your invitation stand apart. These paper features boost your response rates:

  1. Thicker stock that feels substantial
  2. Professional finish (gloss or matte)
  3. Clean, readable fonts like Times New Roman or Georgia



### Include a return address and thank-you note

Companies need to know where to send gifts if they decide to participate. The [return address](https://withjoy.com/blog/how-to-perfect-your-return-address-on-wedding-invitations-an-etiquette-guide/?srsltid=AfmBOoqU6SLj-kYaAI6OVG3jRW13lmW0DfSHXADxBO_MQsOFiPCQYPgJ) serves two vital purposes – it provides the shipping destination and handles undeliverable mail. A pre-written thank-you shows your appreciation whatever their response. Put your return address on the invitation envelope’s back flap with both names and full address details. Proper return address placement in the upper left corner, ½ inch from the left edge, helps avoid mail delivery issues.

## Conclusion

Sending wedding invitations to your [favorite companies](https://withjoy.com/blog/best-wedding-registry-stores/?srsltid=AfmBOopbzpgaUr3JOku76vm_tldqeTq0qlzndde2P3dFtWbeQw-1Nt6E) adds a fun twist to wedding planning. Those extra invites could turn into surprise gifts, special keepsakes, or useful items for your big day. This tradition lets you include brands that have been part of your relationship experience in a unique way.

Your success depends on being genuine when you reach out to companies. Pick brands that matter to you both instead of just looking for free stuff. Companies will appreciate your authentic connection through your individual-specific messages and might respond in more meaningful ways.

The right timing makes a big difference. You should mail your invitations 3-4 months before your wedding date. This gives companies enough time to respond. Quality materials and proper addressing will help your invitation catch attention among all the requests they get.

This piece gives you everything you need to start sending invitations to your favorite brands. You might get personal notes from Mickey and Minnie, free ice cream vouchers from Ben & Jerry’s, or travel perks from Southwest Airlines. These unexpected wedding gifts will become treasured memories of your special day.

Now you know what to do with that extra set of wedding invitations! Happy mailing and congratulations on your upcoming wedding!
