With vibrant and rich colors on full display, it isn’t hard to see why many couples choose to tie the knot in fall. Embrace the phenomenal colors and natural elements of the season during your [fall wedding](https://withjoy.com/wedding-website/) with creative centerpieces that can range from earthy and rustic to moody and mysterious. Choose stunning fall flowers like dahlias, chrysanthemums and chocolate cosmos, or showcase the harvest by letting seasonal fruit, mini pumpkins and gourds grace tablescapes. You can even incorporate foliage and branches into fall wedding decorations. There are endless options when it comes to color palettes, table settings, floral arrangements and other details, so find inspiration in these 35 fall centerpiece ideas that will enhance any autumn wedding reception. 

## **Colorful Floral Arrangements**

Fall has a phenomenal color palette, from rich reds to alluring amethysts. Whether you hire a florist or make [DIY floral bouquets](https://withjoy.com/blog/ultimate-guide-to-diy-wedding-flowers/), choose seasonal colors for your wedding flowers and centerpieces, table linens and [wedding website](https://withjoy.com/blog/creative-wedding-website-examples/).

### **1\. Choose Rouge**

![A red flower gives a pop of color to a soft floral arrangement](https://withjoy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Fall-Centerpieces-Choose-Rouge-1024x1024.jpg)![A red flower gives a pop of color to a soft floral arrangement](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201024%201024%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Make a statement with red flowers at the center of your reception’s tablescapes. Go bold with a monochromatic floral arrangement, offer pops of color by weaving in classic roses or build depth with a textural bloom. The fiery color is a clear choice for any fall wedding. 

### **2\. Don’t Overlook Orange**

Whether your wedding aesthetic is boho chic or traditional, orange is a seasonal hue fit for an autumn wedding. Enchanting orange flowers add a warm glow when paired with white, cream or yellow blooms. Choose wedding flowers like ranunculus and dahlias in orange for a touch of whimsy. 

### **3\. Add a Punch of Yellow**

![Sunflowers in a mason jar vase add a joyful feel to a couple’s special day](https://withjoy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Fall-Centerpieces-Add-a-Punch-of-Yellow-1024x775.jpg)![Sunflowers in a mason jar vase add a joyful feel to a couple’s special day](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201024%20775%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

From cheery sunflowers to unique Craspedia billy balls, yellow flowers are sure to invigorate any floral arrangement. Think beyond sunny yellow for fall, and consider a darker or lighter color scheme. Florals in mustard, butterscotch, honey or subtle yellow shades may better fit your wedding vibe.

### **4\. Blend in Brown**

Brown may not immediately come to mind when it comes to wedding flowers, but the color offers a range of gorgeous possibilities. Select rich caramels, earthy tans and deep chocolates for a natural and sophisticated design. Mums and daisies offer a solid foundation, while dried flowers add pattern and depth. 

### **5\. Punctuate with Purple**

![Seasonal dahlias and purple blooms make an elegant floral wedding centerpiece](https://withjoy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Fall-Centerpieces-Punctuate-with-Purple-1024x1024.jpg)![Seasonal dahlias and purple blooms make an elegant floral wedding centerpiece](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201024%201024%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Romantic and regal, purple can evoke a variety of emotions for your desired wedding atmosphere. Leverage this powerful color by choosing lighter tints in early fall or jewel tones for a richer feel that’s perfect later in the season. Don’t forget to experiment with texture and bud size.

## **Fall Foliage and Greenery**

Dress up your centerpieces with in-season greenery, leaves and grasses. These additions can amplify color schemes and elevate nearly any decor. 

### **6\. Highlight Fall Leaves**

Fall leaves are a quintessential symbol of the season. Luminous leaves can star in floral arrangements or adorn the table. Whether you’re working with a professional florist or pruning shrubs from your backyard, autumnal foliage can fit any budget.

### **7\. Select Succulents**

![A single succulent adds rustic appeal to a wedding tabletop](https://withjoy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Fall-Centerpieces-Select-Succulents-1024x683.jpg)![A single succulent adds rustic appeal to a wedding tabletop](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201024%20683%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Succulents are an attractive addition to a ceremony and reception. The plants are available year-round and feature a variety of colors. Select succulents that include orangey-pink or purple hues to complement seasonal cuttings in floral arrangements. 

### **8\. Pick Pampas Grass**

> 
> [A post shared by Joy | Wedding Websites & More (@withjoy)](https://www.instagram.com/p/ChPu9plsiMC/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading)

This plant is a natural fit for a bohemian wedding vibe, but it can also work with modern, coastal or southwest aesthetics. Leverage the grass’ height to create a dramatic display, or add softness to a floral design with thoughtfully placed cuttings. No matter the arrangement, pampas grass makes a statement.

### **9\. Mix in Eucalyptus**

![Fall wedding decorations on a tabletop featuring a eucalyptus garland](https://withjoy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Fall-Centerpieces-Mix-in-Eucalyptus-1024x683.jpg)![Fall wedding decorations on a tabletop featuring a eucalyptus garland](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201024%20683%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Greenery keeps the focus of a centerpiece on the flowers. Eucalyptus leaves support that goal, but they can also stand alone. Go rustic or ethereal by laying a eucalyptus garland across your reception tables. You can also sprinkle in dainty flowers or votive candle holders in fall colors for an elegant centerpiece. 

### **10\. Dress Up with Olive Branches**

> 
> [A post shared by Joy | Wedding Websites & More (@withjoy)](https://www.instagram.com/p/CGBWqDclZRr/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading)

Laid-back yet refined, olive branches provide an organic feel to any table decor. The greenery can embellish a simple bouquet or add drama to a dessert table display. Take it up a notch and feature branches bursting with fruit. Your guests will be gushing over these displays for years!

## **Natural Centerpieces**

Organic fall wedding decorations can add intrigue to a tabletop and help complete your vision of a gorgeous display.

### **11\. Choose Rustic Tree Slices**

![An unfinished tree slice paired with fall flowers at an autumn wedding](https://withjoy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Fall-Centerpieces-Choose-Rustic-Tree-Slices-1024x1024.jpg)![An unfinished tree slice paired with fall flowers at an autumn wedding](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201024%201024%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Let the beauty of unfinished wood enrich the tablescape. Place a round tree slice at the center of each table to act as a tray for seasonal blooms, candles, lanterns and even photos from your courtship. To tie it all together, incorporate wood accents into other wedding details, such as the cake stand or table number signs.

### **12\. Add Whimsical Branches**

![Delicate branches are woven together to make an elegant wreath for a fall wedding centerpiece](https://withjoy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Fall-Centerpieces-Add-Whimsical-Branches-1024x683.jpg)![Delicate branches are woven together to make an elegant wreath for a fall wedding centerpiece](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201024%20683%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Pay homage to the heroes of autumn: trees. Using a tree as a centerpiece may not be practical, so give them a nod by decorating with branches. Capture the magical atmosphere of a forest with towering branches covered in glowing leaves, or wow your guests with elegant wreaths.

### **13\. Use Acorns or Pinecones**

![Pinecone decor with a name card that reads "bride" at a fall wedding reception](https://withjoy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Fall-Centerpieces-Use-Acorns-or-Pinecones-1024x584.jpg)![Pinecone decor with a name card that reads "bride" at a fall wedding reception](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201024%20584%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Channel a rustic vibe at your wedding by decorating with acorns and pinecones. The forest-found objects can easily fill any size or style of glass vessel. Scatter across the tabletop for a nature-inspired scene or place within flower arrangements for a simple yet seasonal touch.

### **14\. Fall for Feathers**

> [A post shared by Joy | Wedding Websites & More (@withjoy)](https://www.instagram.com/p/B8Hub7EF28s/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading)

When it comes to feathers, a little goes a long way. Use them as an ornamental element to add warm browns and contrasting whites to centerpieces or other wedding features, like the cake table. Whether you choose large or small feathers, they will certainly add an intriguing design to your fall nuptials. 

### **15\. Add Allure with Bones**

![Gorgeous fall flowers positioned next to a skull give off a boho chic vibe](https://withjoy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Fall-Centerpieces-Add-Allure-with-Bones-1024x1024.jpg)![Gorgeous fall flowers positioned next to a skull give off a boho chic vibe](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201024%201024%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Draw inspiration from Georgia O’Keeffe and incorporate bones — think small skulls or antlers — into your approach to wedding decor. These pieces add mystery and allure. Pair them with a moody color palette for an aesthetic that will transform your wedding venue into a cozy retreat. 

### **16\. Scout Out Stones**

![A variety of crystals are positioned on top of a wooden centerpiece at a bohemian-style wedding reception](https://withjoy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Fall-Centerpieces-Scout-Out-Stones-1024x699.jpg)![A variety of crystals are positioned on top of a wooden centerpiece at a bohemian-style wedding reception](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201024%20699%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

For an earthy vibe that isn’t overly rustic, display river rocks and stones at the center of your wedding reception’s tables. Select smooth river rocks for a soothing feel or rugged stones for a rural tone. To pump up the glam, showcase crystal-filled geodes in seasonal tones like amethyst. 

## **Edible Centerpieces**

Let seasonal fruits and vegetables grace the table — an ideal choice for non-floral arrangements. Think pumpkin bouquets and apple-filled containers for a fresh take on centerpieces.

### **17\. Reimagine Pumpkins**

![Mini white pumpkins with baby's breath add charm to a wedding reception tabletop](https://withjoy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Fall-Centerpieces-Reimagine-Pumpkins-1024x1024.jpg)![Mini white pumpkins with baby's breath add charm to a wedding reception tabletop](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201024%201024%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Pumpkins are an icon of fall, but they don’t necessarily scream wedding chic. Transform the humble gourd into a remarkable centerpiece by using a variety of colors and sizes on the tabletop, such as mini white pumpkins nestled among colorful cuttings or lush greenery. 

### **18\. Pick Apples**

Deck out your reception venue with these sweet beauties. Apples naturally feature a range of colors that will add more depth to your celebration’s color spectrum. Bundle apples in a fanciful container to create a stunning take on a fruit bowl. 

### **19\. Garnish with Pomegranates**

![Pomegranates sit atop a shining metal tray in a sophisticated fall centerpiece with a white candle](https://withjoy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Fall-Celebrations-Garnish-with-Pomegranates-1024x731.jpg)![Pomegranates sit atop a shining metal tray in a sophisticated fall centerpiece with a white candle](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201024%20731%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Amp up the drama by incorporating pomegranates. The full-bodied fruit offers a jewel-tone color that seamlessly blends with many seasonal palettes. Keep them whole or break them open for a daring display that will surprise and delight wedding attendees. 

### **20\. Go Bold with Grapes**

> [A post shared by Joy | Wedding Websites & More (@withjoy)](https://www.instagram.com/p/B-CjWPhFW83/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading)

Turn to a country vineyard as inspiration and feature grapes in your table decor. Luxurious grapes, and even grape leaves, are an easy embellishment to a place setting. Whether your big day is influenced by wine country or a more glamorous affair, the fruit provides a fresh feel that couples will appreciate.

### **21\. Cozy Up to Cinnamon**

![Fall wedding centerpiece with dried orange slices, cinnamon sticks, a wreath of branches and a white candle](https://withjoy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Fall-Centerpiece-Cozy-up-to-Cinnamon-1024x683.jpg)![Fall wedding centerpiece with dried orange slices, cinnamon sticks, a wreath of branches and a white candle](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201024%20683%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Add warmth and a fragrant aroma to your special day with cinnamon sticks or cloves. The signature fall spices can serve as a unique vase filler, with a deep brown color that offers an appealing contrast to flowers in yellow or orange hues. 

### **22\. Think Harvest**

![Fall harvest centerpiece with a deep purple corn husk, cabbage, gourds, taper candles and a floral centerpiece with feathers ](https://withjoy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Fall-Centerpiece-Think-Harvest-1024x731.jpg)![Fall harvest centerpiece with a deep purple corn husk, cabbage, gourds, taper candles and a floral centerpiece with feathers ](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201024%20731%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Elevate the common corn husk or dried wheat into a show-stopping ornamentation for your wedding centerpieces. Weave wheat pieces into seasonal blooms for a wispy and whimsical display, or use in place of a ribbon on a vase. 

## **Fall Decor**

When choosing centerpieces for your big day, don’t forget to consider the look of the entire table. Be sure to select coordinating colors and patterns for items such as napkins, candle holders and tablecloths.

### **23\. Candles Emblaze**

If you and your partner prefer non-floral centerpieces for your big day, candles are a fitting alternative. The size, shape and color of candles will depend on your autumn wedding style. For instance, pairing candles with mirrors leans modern, whereas tall taper candles can help bring an Old World aesthetic to life.

### **24\. Play with Plaids or Lace**

![A lace table runner sits atop a wooden table at a wedding venue to create rustic elegance](https://withjoy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Fall-Centerpieces-Play-with-Plaids-or-Lace-1-1024x732.jpg)![A lace table runner sits atop a wooden table at a wedding venue to create rustic elegance](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201024%20732%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Say goodbye to monochromatic linens and welcome plaid fabrics or intricate lace into your reception venue. Plaid is a hallmark pattern of fall and brings an arresting beauty to any table. Lace establishes dimension by creating positive and negative space throughout the tablescape.

### **25\. Choose Colored Vases**

![Rustic table holds floral bouquets in orange, black, and golden colored vases](https://withjoy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Fall-Centerpieces-Choose-Colored-Vases-1024x1024.jpg)![Rustic table holds floral bouquets in orange, black, and golden colored vases](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201024%201024%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

For some couples, planning the decorations for a wedding reception can be distressing. Take it easy with this simple way to add pops of seasonal colors to your big day. Fall-colored vases can be a beautiful, affordable and manageable choice for tabletops.

### **26\. Trim with Burlap**

![Burlap fabric is used as a table runner for a budget-friendly fall decoration](https://withjoy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Fall-Centerpieces-Trim-with-Burlap-1024x683.jpg)![Burlap fabric is used as a table runner for a budget-friendly fall decoration](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201024%20683%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Burlap is the darling of any rustic fall wedding. This material is a favorite for couples because it’s so versatile. Use it as a table runner to bump up texture or slice into strips to gussy up a glass hurricane candle holder.

### **27\. Try Rattan and Woven Fabric**

![A woven placemat is an eye-catching choice next to a collection of seasonal greenery, votive candles and a gold lantern](https://withjoy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Fall-Centerpieces-Try-Rattan-1-1024x683.jpg)![A woven placemat is an eye-catching choice next to a collection of seasonal greenery, votive candles and a gold lantern](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201024%20683%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Incorporate a home decor trend into your wedding by using rattans or woven cane fabrics in your tablescape. Similar to burlap, these materials create unexpected texture. Dazzle your guests with unique lanterns, placemats or baskets. 

## **Unique Containers**

Your wedding centerpiece vessel is as important as the objects that go inside. Get creative with the container to build out a phenomenal design. 

### **28\. Go Vintage**

![Wedding flowers in an old-fashioned pitcher embody a vintage feel](https://withjoy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Fall-Centerpieces-Go-Vintage-1-1024x1024.jpg)![Wedding flowers in an old-fashioned pitcher embody a vintage feel](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201024%201024%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Old-fashioned watering cans or galvanized buckets provide a vintage vibe with a natural edge. Perfect for holding freshly cut blooms and branches, these containers make eye-catching designs for farmhouse-themed soirees. Consider adding other vintage elements to the table to turn up the charm.

### **29\. Feature Birdcages**

![Succulents rest within a decorative birdcage](https://withjoy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Fall-Centerpieces-Feature-Birdcages-1-1024x1024.jpg)![Succulents rest within a decorative birdcage](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201024%201024%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Bird lovers or not, draw inspiration from our feathered friends for your wedding’s tabletop display. Start with sleek or decorative birdcages, then fill them with organic elements like greenery, seasonal blooms, leaves or even a nest. A wire or glass cloche can also be employed if you and your partner prefer.

### **30\. Personalize Mason Jars**

![Burlap and lace are wrapped around mason jars to make an adorable rustic centerpiece](https://withjoy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Fall-Centerpieces-Mason-Jars-1024x683.jpg)![Burlap and lace are wrapped around mason jars to make an adorable rustic centerpiece](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201024%20683%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Mason jars are overflowing with possibilities. These jars act as blank canvas and can be personalized to fit you and your future spouse’s wedding style. Fill them with wildflowers for a sweet floral arrangement, or group them together and use votive candles to make an illuminating tablescape. 

### **31\. Light Up with Lanterns**

Glass, metal and paper are just a few of the materials that couples can select when it comes to lantern-based centerpieces. Add in a seasonal aesthetic with fall greenery or colorful candles. The lanterns will provide a soft glow to your post-ceremony celebration that perfectly captures the magic of autumn. 

## **DIY Ideas**

If creating centerpieces on your own is your jam, look to these beautiful, rustic fall wedding ideas.

### **32\. Arrange Bottles**

Let’s face it: Centerpiece supplies can add up. But a lower-cost option is within reach, maybe even sitting inside your refrigerator. Arrange glass bottles across your reception tables for a sophisticated design. Fill them with single-stem flowers or delicate baby’s breath for a simple floral focal point.

### **33\. Wrap it Up**

Personalize vases and bottles with unique ribbons and trim. Play with widths, lengths and hues to add interest to your tabletop. Natural materials also fit in well — consider using straw or jute rope for a stunning and sustainable DIY touch. 

### **34\. Place Pots**

Plant lovers, this one’s for you! Place potted plants such as succulents, fresh fall herbs or flowering cacti on the tabletop. Terracotta pots are a handsome choice that’s on trend with the classic fall color palette. Add allure by grouping a variety of sizes and shades. You can also use them for other parts of the wedding, such as the seating chart.

### **35\. Leave a Mark**

Transform jars or containers into flower bud vases with spray paint. Play with stencils to create negative space in the design. This is a simple project for couples to work on together, adding to your wedding-related memories.
