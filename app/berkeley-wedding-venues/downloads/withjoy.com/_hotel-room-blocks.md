Questions

How does it work?

Joyâs hotel room block service helps you find and reserve hotel rooms for your wedding guests at exclusive group rates, with no financial commitment or cancellation fees. You can also get premium perks and upgrades, and communicate with a personal travel concierge.

How do I share my hotel room blocks with my guests?

You can easily share your hotel room blocks on your Joy wedding website or send a direct link to your guests.

Am I financially responsible?

No, you are not financially responsible for your hotel room block. Joy lets you reserve a block of rooms with no money down and no credit card required. Joy takes on the risk for you, so you can enjoy your wedding without any worries.

How far in advance should I reserve a hotel room block?

Itâs best to reserve your hotel room block 6-9 months before your wedding. This ensures availability, allows guests to book rooms, and secures the best rates.

Can I increase the number of rooms after reserving the block?

Yes, depending on availability. Increasing your room block is recommended as soon as you realize additional rooms are needed.

What is the cancellation process?

Joyâs reservations are risk-free, meaning there are no cancellation fees if your block isnât fully booked. However, specific policies vary by hotel, so check the terms before booking.

Who is responsible for paying for the rooms? 

Your guests are responsible for paying for their rooms. You are not financially accountable unless youâve booked a guaranteed or attrition block.

How many rooms should I reserve?

Most hotels require a minimum of 10 rooms to create a block, though this can vary. Your Joy concierge will help guide you through the process based on your guest count.

Hotel Room Blocks: The Ultimate Guide for Your Wedding

Planning your wedding is an exciting yet complex journey with numerous details to manage. Reserving a hotel room block is one key element that can simplify the process for you and your guests. A hotel room block ensures guests have comfortable accommodations at a discounted rate near your venue. With Joyâs concierge service, reserving hotel room blocks has never been easier. From exclusive group rates to a dedicated concierge team, Joy offers a hassle-free way to manage accommodations, allowing you to focus on enjoying your big day.  
  
But what exactly is a hotel room block, and why is it essential for your wedding? Letâs explore how hotel blocks work, the types available, and how Joy can help you secure the best options for your guests.

What is a Hotel Room Block?

A hotel room block is a set of rooms reserved for your wedding guests at a special rate, often with added perks like complimentary upgrades or amenities. These blocks are handy for hosting a destination wedding or expecting many out-of-town guests. By booking a block, you ensure your guests can access nearby accommodations without scrambling for rooms at the last minute.  
  
When you reserve a hotel block, you typically secure a discounted group rate for a specific number of rooms. Your guests can then book these rooms individually, ensuring they have a comfortable place to stay while attending your wedding. Additionally, reserving a block simplifies transportation logistics, allowing you to coordinate shuttles or shared rides more efficiently.

Tailoring Your Hotel Room Block to Your Wedding

Thereâs more than one approach when reserving hotel room blocks for your wedding. Whether youâre celebrating close to home or hosting a destination wedding, understanding your options can make all the difference in ensuring your guests have a comfortable stay.   
  
**Local Weddings vs. Destination Celebrations**  
  
For a local wedding, convenience is vital. Most couples reserve room blocks at nearby hotels that are easily accessible from the venue. You may want to consider multiple hotels if you expect a large number of guestsâsay 20 or 30 rooms. Offering options at different prices allows your guests to choose accommodations that fit their preferences and budget. And if youâve booked a hotel venue for your reception, you can often secure a block of rooms right there as part of your wedding package.   
  
The approach is similar for destination weddings but with a few extra perks. Since your guests are likely traveling from afar, staying at or near your chosen resort or hotel can help make your celebration feel more intimate. Many resorts automatically include room blocks in their wedding packages, ensuring everyone has a spot to relax and enjoy the festivities. If your wedding destination has various accommodation options nearby, it might make sense to offer more choicesâespecially if youâre hosting a more extensive guest list. This allows guests to select the stay that best suits their travel style.  
  
**Courtesy Blocks vs. Contracted Blocks**   
  
Hotels generally offer two types of room blocks: courtesy and contracted.  
  
A courtesy block is a no-strings-attached optionârooms are held for your guests without any obligation on your part to fill them. This is an excellent choice if youâre unsure how many guests will need accommodations. Some venues even include a courtesy block as part of their package, especially for destination or resort weddings.  
  
A contracted room block, however, comes with more formal agreements. You might need to meet specific conditions, like booking a certain number of rooms or depositing. This option can be beneficial if youâre confident in your guest count and want to lock in the best rates, but itâs essential to read the fine print before committing.

Why You Need a Hotel Room Block for Your Wedding

Booking a hotel room block offers several key advantages:   
  


  1. **Convenience for Your Guests:** Your guests wonât have to worry about finding accommodations; theyâll have a reserved spot at a hotel close to your venue.
  2. **Discounted Rates:** Hotel blocks often come with discounted group rates, saving guests money while offering them high-quality accommodations.
  3. **Streamlined Coordination:** When your guests stay at the exact location, itâs easier to arrange transportation, coordinate events, and ensure everyone arrives on time for your wedding day.
  4. **Enhanced Guest Experience:** By offering your guests a wedding hotel block, you improve their experience, providing a more enjoyable stay. Many hotels offer added perks like welcome amenities for your guests or upgrades for the bride and groom.

  
With Joyâs concierge service, these benefits are just the beginning. You can book your block without any financial risk and enjoy the peace of mind that your guestsâ accommodations are taken care of.

Types of Hotel Room Blocks

When reserving hotel blocks, itâs essential to understand the different types available. Each type has its pros and cons, so itâs vital to choose the one that best suits your needs:

  1.   
**Courtesy Block**   
  
A courtesy block is the most flexible type of room block. It allows you to reserve rooms for your guests without any financial obligation. The hotel will hold a specific number of rooms for a certain period, and guests can book them at a discounted rate. If the rooms arenât filled, you have no penalty or financial responsibility. However, availability is not guaranteed once the hotel fills up.
  2. **Guaranteed Block**  
  
A guaranteed block, on the other hand, requires a financial commitment. You agree to a certain number of rooms; if those rooms arenât booked, you may be responsible for paying for them. This block type is more suited to larger weddings where youâre confident that most rooms will be booked.
  3. **Attrition Block**  
  
With an attrition block, you must fill a specific percentage of the rooms in the block (typically 80-90%). Youâll be responsible for paying for the difference if you donât meet that percentage. This block type is more common for more significant events, where thereâs a good chance of filling most of the rooms.  
  
Understanding these options helps you choose the best type of hotel block for your wedding. With Joy, your concierge can help you decide which block makes the most sense for your needs.

Tips for Reserving Hotel Room Blocks

Reserving hotel room blocks can be a breeze with little planning. Here are some tips to help ensure a smooth process:  
  


  * **Start Early:** The earlier you begin the process, the better. Hotels can fill up quickly, especially during popular wedding seasons or holiday weekends. Booking early increases the chances of securing the best rates and availability.
  * **Estimate Guest Needs:** A good rule of thumb is to reserve rooms for 30-40% of your total guest list. For example, if youâre expecting 100 out-of-town guests, booking 30-40 rooms should cover their needs.
  * **Consider Multiple Hotels:** If your guest list includes people with varying budgets, consider reserving blocks at two or more hotels. This allows your guests to choose accommodations that fit their budget while staying close to your venue.
  * **Negotiate Perks:** Many hotels offer complimentary perks, such as suite upgrades, free breakfasts, or welcome amenities for your guests. Donât be afraid to ask for these extras when reserving your block.
  * **Communicate Clearly:** Once your blocks are reserved, make sure your guests know how to book their rooms. Share the booking link through your wedding website or invitations, and remind guests to book early to secure the discounted rate.
