Overview

Description

INTRODUCING EMME 360TM ROTATING ALL-IN-ONE CONVERTIBLE CAR SEAT WITH 360° FLEXISPIN AND TENSIONFIXTM  
Our innovative rotational car seat with 360° FlexiSpin technology allows you to swivel the car seat in all modes of use (rear- and forward-facing), so you can get your child in and out of the vehicle easily and with less back strain.  
We’ve also solved the most common car seat installation problem that 7 out of 10 parents unknowingly have—loose vehicle belt tension. Maxi-Cosi’s TensionFix is our patent-pending red-to-green tension-sensitive indicator that shows you when your seat belt has tension. Emme 360’s exceptional design meets or exceeds all federal safety standards and is National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) compliant. The attached connection cord ensures that the base and seat must be used together when installed.  
Emme 360 is made to evolve with your child as they grow (and grow), from birth to ten years. Travel with confidence in all 3 modes: rear-facing (5–40 lbs. and 19”–40”), forward-facing (22–65 lbs. and 29”–49”), and belt-positioning booster (40–100 lbs. and 43”–52”).
