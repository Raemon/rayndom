## Amsterdam – Jam-packed with things to do and places to see

There's no getting bored on a trip to Amsterdam. Culture vultures have more than 80 museums to visit, with subjects as diverse as diamonds, computers and cheese to accompany the more conventional art and history collections. For music-lovers, concert halls, pop arenas and more intimate venues are plentiful. The Vondelpark, covering 120 acres, is a great place to relax with open green spaces and plenty of trees to provide shade. And if you are lucky, a show may be on at the open-air theatre. Kids will enjoy the play area and the paddling pool with stepping stones. Architecture enthusiasts will admire the Royal Palace of Amsterdam, styled after ancient Rome, and the Oude Kerk (Old Church), the city's oldest structure. Snack fans should try freshly baked ‘stroopwafels’ for a sweet treat or go for a ‘patatje oorlog’ (French fries, mayonnaise, raw onions and peanut sauce) for something more filling.

## Top Attractions in Amsterdam

  * ##### Rijksmuseum – A national treasure in the Museum District

Amsterdam's Rijksmuseum holds many national treasures, mainly Dutch art and historical artefacts exploring 800 years of Dutch history, but also a collection of Asian art. There are approximately 8000 exhibits in this million-strong collection. Rembrandt's ‘The Night Watch' may be the most celebrated but there are plenty more masterpieces.The building itself is a treasure. Purpose-built after previous venues proved unsuitable, construction of this stunning building began in 1876. The Philips Wing was added in 1890. Constructed from fragments of demolished buildings, it offers insight into Dutch architectural history and is sometimes called the ‘fragment building'. 

  * ##### The Anne Frank House – An important historical reminder

Visit the office building where Otto Frank, Anne's father, ran his business until the Nazi occupation, and where the Franks and four others hid from Nazi persecution between July 1942 and their arrest in August 1944.See the Secret Annex and imagine what it would be like for eight people to live there for two years in constant fear of discovery, with only four of Otto's trusted former employees for outside contact.The building is now a museum dedicated to preserving their memory, and features restored rooms, Anne's diary, and photos and objects from the period among the exhibits. 

  * ##### Van Gogh Museum – A fitting venue for masterpieces

A must for art-lovers with 200 paintings and 400 drawings by Van Gogh, including such highlights as ‘The Potato Eaters' and ‘Sunflowers', while a selection of 700 letters helps provide context and themes for his work. For example, he wrote that sunflowers communicated ‘gratitude'. The rectangular Rietveld building affords plenty of space for the paintings on permanent display, while the sleek semi-oval Kurokawa wing, connected by a tunnel, houses temporary exhibitions. A glass entrance area completed this oval in 2015.Van Gogh's work is organised chronologically into five periods and the collection also showcases works by his contemporaries. 

  * ##### The Jordaan – A trendy district at the heart of Amsterdam

Best-known as the location of the Anne Frank House, this area of central Amsterdam is also home to many trendy boutiques, bars and other attractions.You could sit outside and engage in a spot of people-watching at one of the Jordaan's many cafés and snack bars.Climb on board the Woonbootsmuseum (Houseboat museum) and gain an insight into river living and the conditions on a working barge.Why not visit Lindengracht Market on a Saturday and peruse the local cheeses, fish and other fresh produce, or pick up a bargain or several on a Monday morning at the Westerstraat Market?
