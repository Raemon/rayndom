## Discover dazzling Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates

Dubai is the most populous city in the United Arab Emirates. Located on the Arabian Gulf, it is a bustling metropolis and home to a true melting pot of diverse cultures from around the world. Well known for its luxury shopping, ultra-modern architecture and penchant for delivering world firsts, this fast-paced city is characterised by its superstructure-filled skyline, dominated by the prestigious Burj Khalifa, currently the world's tallest tower and a global icon at over 828 metres high. Renowned for the warm hospitality and rich cultural heritage of the local Emirati people, visitors are made to feel very welcome. Blessed all year round with golden sunshine, beautiful beaches, intriguing deserts, luxurious hotels and a plethora of must-see attractions, Dubai happily hosts millions of international leisure and business tourists each year.

##  Explore Dubai with Marriott 

## Top Attractions in Dubai

  * ##### Rise up at the Burj Khalifa

The world's tallest tower soars above Dubai's ultra-modern skyline at over 828 metres tall, with 160 stories hosting hotels, residences and offices. Take a trip in the world's longest lift to enjoy breakfast or an afternoon tea against an endless horizon at The Lounge (levels 152 to 154) or marvel at the vast cityscape and stunning sunsets from the observation decks (levels 124, 125 and 148). At ground level, the Dubai Fountain in the middle of the Burj Khalifa Lake enchants spectators with dancing multicoloured waters scored to musical favourites. 

  * ##### Lose yourself in The Dubai Mall

With over 1,300 retail stores, 200 places to eat and drink, a VR Park, an edutainment centre, a cinema, an Olympic-sized ice rink and an aquarium, the Dubai Mall is so much more than a shopping centre. Located in Downtown Dubai, this world-renowned mall has something for everyone, from luxury shopping and fine dining to more traditional Arab market stalls and outlets in the Souk. You can hit the shops in the country's fashion capital, step into the future on a virtual rollercoaster and even have a close encounter with a shark. At The Dubai Mall, anything is possible. 

  * ##### Pick up the pace on a Desert Safari Discovery

Exciting dune cruising, extraordinary sunsets and a delicious dinner under the stars await on this incredible journey into the desert, just beyond Dubai. Feel invigorated as you fly across the dunes in a 4x4 then slow it down as you stop to watch the sun disappear into the sands. Carry on to a Bedouin camp getaway where every moment is a chance to create unforgettable memories. Enjoy a tantalising barbeque, captivating camel rides and dazzling dinner-time entertainment in this epic landscape unlike any other. 

  * ##### Fun for all the family at Dubai Parks and Resorts

Prepare yourself for an action-packed few days visiting some, or all, of the four theme and water parks that make up Dubai Parks and Resorts. Adrenaline, excitement and captivation await as you discover the magical worlds, inspired by Bollywood, movies and childhood favourites. After testing your limits on the multiple rides and attractions and watching jaw-dropping spectacles and shows, relax and unwind around the scenic lake. You can follow up with a well-earned meal and maybe even some retail therapy. Both young and old will love this truly immersive experience.
