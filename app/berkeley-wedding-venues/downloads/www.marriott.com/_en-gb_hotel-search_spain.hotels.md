## Spain - where vibrant cities meet tranquil shores

With the opportunity to unwind and explore, Spain is characterised by clear waters and nightlife as vibrant as the cuisine. Soak up Mediterranean sunshine in Alicante, a port city where palm trees line the promenade and The Castle of Santa Bárbara offers panoramic views from Mount Benacantil. Travel up the coast towards Barcelona where you can enjoy a city by the sea. The lively Las Ramblas boulevard runs through the centre, whilst La Sagrada Familia's impressive architecture takes centre stage in the Eixample district. Located in the heart of the Basque Country, Bilbao is known as the city of the Guggenheim and offers a fusion of avant-garde architecture. It is home to the world-famous museum, set alongside streets dotted with pintxo bars serving up a taste of traditional Basque cuisine. Top off your time in Spain with a visit to the Royal Palace of Madrid. The nearby El Retiro Park is a tranquil oasis within the bustling capital.
