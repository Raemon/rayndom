Amenities and Attractions

## The Pool, Coves and The Lazy River

Grab your float and drift away at unhurried pace on the winding waters of the quarter-mile, 670,000 gallon Lazy River. Long a primary attraction, the Lazy River meanders through the heart of the waterpark, flowing through lush tropical greenery with jets, waterfalls and bridges from one zone to the next–connecting the pleasing pools and coves with one another. 

![family floating down lazy river](https://cache.marriott.com/is/image/marriotts7prod/jw-mcojw-mcojw-lazy-river-81181-46346:Classic-Hor?wid=1300&fit=constrain)

### Six Distinct Zones. Six Different Ways to Play.

The Grande Lakes Waterpark is divided into six distinct zones. It’s easy to find your way around. And it’s easy to find the fun that suits your mood, from splashing around with the kids to finding escape in your own private sanctuary. 

###  The Oasis 

The exclusive Oasis is a serene firepit lounge area of the waterpark, ideal for having a relaxing drink around a fire or taking a dip in a private plunge pool. The Oasis also includes exclusive VIP seating and event lawns. You can find The Oasis at the southernmost tip of the waterpark.

###  Headwaters 

Directly adjacent to the ever-popular EvrBar, Headwaters is home to the prominent Headwaters Slidetower and three water slides–the Current, the Rapids and the Chute. Headwaters can be found in the Southeast corner of the park.

###  Splash Cove 

Energy abounds at Splash Cove. As the name suggests, it’s the area of the park where kids and kids at heart come to have a splashing good time. Splash Cove includes the PlayVenture playground, AquaVenture water course, and flexible event space. Splash Cove is in the North and East corner of the waterpark.

###  The Sanctuary 

An island separated from the rest of the waterpark by the Lazy River, The Sanctuary is perfect for people who just want to get away from it all - in the middle of it all. The Sanctuary is in the very center of the waterpark and has sightlines to all of its amenities/features.

###  The Lagoon 

Cares simply float away at The Lagoon, a wide area of calm water bordering the Lazy River. There are relaxing hot springs here. And if all that floating makes you hungry, grab a bite or a refreshing beverage at Knife Burger: The Outpost. The Lagoon is in the Southwest corner of the park.

###  Knife Burger 

Chef Tesar brings tantalizing flavor poolside for creative and casual fare at Knife Burger, where amazing burgers are paired with fries and handspun, frosty shakes. Knife Burger is located in the Southeast corner of the park.

### Luxury Cabanas

Elevate your waterpark experience with our exclusive new cabanas, available in a variety of sizes and configurations. Savor dedicated food and beverage service from Knife Burger, created by Michelin Star Chef John Tesar. Relax and reconnect in these private spaces, located throughout the waterpark for an extraordinary getaway.
