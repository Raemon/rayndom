### Plan Your Safari

Ready to begin your journey? Contact our team to help you plan the perfect safari experience, tailored just for you: [Email Reservations](mailto:reservations@jwmarriottmasaimara.com) | [Email Sales](mailto:sales@jwmarriottmasaimara.com)

Seasonal Information 

The Masai Mara offers exceptional safari experiences year-round, with each season bringing its own unique highlights. The dry season (June to October) is ideal for wildlife viewing, especially during the Great Migration. The green season (November to May) brings lush landscapes, fewer crowds, and excellent birdwatching. Our team is happy to recommend the best time based on your preferences and what you'd like to experience.

What to Pack 

Pack light, breathable clothing in neutral tones, long-sleeved shirts and pants for sun and insect protection, and comfortable closed-toe shoes for safaris. Bring a jacket or sweater for chilly mornings and evenings. Don’t forget a hat and sunglasses for sun protection.

Remember to pack light and consider any luggage restrictions that may apply to your mode of travel. Most importantly, pack an open mind and a sense of adventure for your unforgettable safari in Masai Mara.

Vaccinations Prior To Travel 

Your journey to the Masai Mara begins with thoughtful preparation, ensuring a seamless and worry-free adventure. While no specific vaccinations are universally mandatory for entry into Kenya, requirements may vary based on your country of origin or recent travel history—some travelers may need to present a Yellow Fever vaccination certificate.

We strongly recommend checking with your local health authorities or travel clinic at least eight weeks before departure to confirm the latest health requirements and recommendations. Though malaria risk is minimal in the Masai Mara, your healthcare provider can advise on any preventive measures suited to your itinerary, allowing you to travel with confidence and peace of mind.

Transportation 

By Air: The quickest way to get to Masai Mara is by air. The closest local airstrip is Keekorok (KEU), and flight time from Nairobi is approximately 1-hour. Flights are available from Nairobi Wilson Airport (WIL), which is approximately 12 km from Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (NBO).

On arrival at the Keekorok airstrip, you will be met by our team, followed by a 1-hour game drive to the Lodge. 

Luggage is limited to 15kg per person (soft bags only) on flight. Should you have additional luggage for the rest of your journey, we would be delighted to assist with storing it in a safe locker.

By Road: A private vehicle can be arranged for transfers between Nairobi and Masai Mara at an additional charge. The journey, approximately 5 to 6 hours, traverses Kenya's stunning scenery and local villages along the way.

Safari With Kids 

For the safety and comfort of our guests, we have age restrictions for children under six. Families can enjoy tailored activities that make the safari adventure engaging for young explorers, from guided nature walks and storytelling sessions to hands-on cultural experiences like beadwork and fire-making, each moment is crafted to inspire curiosity and connection with the wild. Contact us for customized family-friendly experiences.

Experiences Included in Stay 

Your stay includes a luxurious tented suite with a private deck and outdoor Jacuzzi overlooking the Talek River and Masai Mara. Enjoy full-board dining, bush meals, daily game drives, access to the Canon photography studio, wellness experiences at the Spa by JW, a fitness center, outdoor pool, fire pit lounge, and return airstrip transfers—each moment crafted for comfort and connection with nature.

Masai Mara National Reserve Park Fees 

2025 Park entry fees per day are $100 (Jan–June) / $200 (July–Dec) for adults and $50 for children (9-17 years). Children below 8 years of age enter for free. 

Fees can be paid directly at the entrance gate of the park, or we could pre-pay for you in advance for a seamless experience. A prepayment of the park fees and a passport copy of each guest will be required.
