Each nine meanders through the rolling terrain as golfers are treated to outstanding ocean views, tropical forests, and glimpses of exotic wildlife. Reserva Conchal Golf Course is open exclusively to resort guests and members of our community. Reservations are strongly recommended but not mandatory.

Westin Family offers activities to expand kids’ horizons, revealing hidden wonders at every turn. Designed to enrich our youngest guests’ stay through exploration, the program brings every locale to life and enhances their well-being. From our Local Activity Guide and custom Travel Journal, to our Kids Club space and interactive programming, every aspect of Westin Family is designed to engage, inspire, and celebrate young travelers and their families.

The Westin® Kids Club offers activities for kids ages four through 12 in a fun-filled, kid friendly environment. The activities may include the following or others depending on programming. A large outdoor play area features swings, slides, and more; indoors, kids can work on arts and crafts projects, play board games, or watch movies. Our club also offers kid-size nap areas, an arcade and game room with a variety of great video games, and an adventure-packed eco-recreational team. Our eco-recreational team arranges educational fun such as eco-hiking, where kids can search for interesting flora and fauna living on resort grounds.

Other options include Spanish lessons, trail hikes, swimming, or a trip to the nearby beach. Snacks and meals are provided throughout the day, and guests can use the facility free of charge as part of the all-inclusive package. No advance reservations are required. Please note that while parents do not need to be present at the Club, they must be there to drop off and pick up children. Children may attend as many hours as desired. No infants under four years old are accepted, and all children must be potty trained.
