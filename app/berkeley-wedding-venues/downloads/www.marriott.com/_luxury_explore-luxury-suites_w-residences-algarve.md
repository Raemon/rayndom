At the apex of W Residences Algarve, the three-bedroom WOW Penthouse is the resort’s most elevated expression of coastal living. Designed around open-plan space and Atlantic views, the residence is shaped around expansive living areas, a high-end kitchen and a sweeping terrace that invites long, sun-soaked days and evenings that linger. 

Indoors and out blur effortlessly, with room to gather, entertain and retreat in equal measure. The primary bedroom draws on ocean-inspired design, while two additional bedrooms offer privacy for family or friends. Select layouts feature a private pool overlooking the Atlantic waves. 

Paired with full access to the resort's dining, wellness and social scene, the WOW Penthouse delivers a stay that feels bold, effortless and unmistakably Algarve.
