Prague's famed Grand Hotel Evropa in the center of the city's New Town has seen plenty of history-making moments — the latest being its transformation into W Prague, which has breathed new life into the Art Nouveau landmark. Whimsy abounds in the hotel's retelling, where design leans into the building's history — ornate woodwork, stained glass windows, gilded accents — but also into W's playful aesthetic, as evident in the Extreme WOW Suite's mix of old-world glamour and curving modern lines.
