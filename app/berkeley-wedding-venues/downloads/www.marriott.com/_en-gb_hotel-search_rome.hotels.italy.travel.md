## Top Attractions in Rome

  * ##### The Colosseum – Gladiators and Games in Ancient Rome

No trip to Rome is complete without visiting the Colosseum, one of the city's most identifiable monuments and a symbol of the city. Also known as the Flavian Amphitheatre, the Colosseum was built by the Emperors Vespasian and Titus, and was the largest of its kind, holding as many as 80,000 spectators to witness gladiatorial combats, chariot races and other forms of ancient entertainment. Although some sections fell into disrepair, it remains one of the most impressive buildings in Rome and welcomes visitors all year round. You might even be lucky enough to catch an outdoor performance which still take place there on occasion. 

  * ##### The Palatine Hill: The Ancient Heart of Rome

The Palatine hill is the centermost of Rome's seven hills and was the most prestigious area of the old city. In ancient times this district was reserved for the wealthiest Roman citizens and Rome's emperors, who built illustrious palaces there, the remains of which can still be seen today. Stroll through the shaded ancient streets and visit the impressive ruins of the Domus Flavia, residence to the Emperor Domitian, as well as the nearby Circus Maximus. Learn more about the many excavated artefacts in the Palatine Museum or take in the natural beauty of the 16th-century Farnese Gardens, built within the ruins of Tiberius' palace. 

  * ##### Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore

The Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore is one of four principal basilicas in Rome and is truly a wonder of architecture and art. Originally constructed in the 4th century, the basilica has grown over hundreds of years, displaying an impressive combination of architectural styles, ranging from early-Christian to Baroque. Inside, visitors can marvel at the 18th-century paintings decorating the walls, the elaborate 5th-century mosaics nestled in the arches and nave and the spectacularly preserved renaissance artwork adorning the ceilings. This beautiful church still belongs to the Vatican City by law, despite its position within the City of Rome. 

  * ##### The Trevi Fountain: Rome's most iconic fountain

An essential site for any visit to the Eternal City, the Trevi Fountain is famed for its soaring baroque relief, intricate statues, and crystal-clear waters that glitter with coins thrown by seekers of luck and love. Originally the end of the Virgin's Aqueduct, the fountain as we see it today was completed in 1762 and depicts the god Oceanus offering health and plenty to the city of Rome. Whether visiting in daylight, or seeing the fountain lit up at night, visitors will be struck by the beauty and clear waters of Rome's most famous fountain and may even like to throw a coin for luck.
