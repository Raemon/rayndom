Escape to a valley oasis, where you will find rooms and suites boasting breathtaking views. Earthy elegance meets modern design in the Senior Suite, which includes an array of contemporary amenities thoughtfully placed among earth-toned furnishings. The blond wood dining table seats six beneath the warm light of pendant chandeliers — when it’s time to work, the dining table functions well as an elegant conference space.
