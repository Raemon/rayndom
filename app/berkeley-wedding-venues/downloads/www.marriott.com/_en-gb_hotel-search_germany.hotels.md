## Experience Germany's cities and natural landscapes

As central Europe's largest country, there's plenty to explore in Germany. Experience Berlin's history with a visit to the Brandenburg Gate and the Reichstag, which has been modernised with a glass dome, allowing you to observe the city below. Enjoy a touch of retail therapy in Düsseldorf, where the world-renowned luxury shopping street, Königsallee, is home to numerous flagship stores. Alternatively, head south and enjoy the beauty of nature in the Eifel National Park and picturesque Siebengebirge mountains. With an unmistakable fusion of old and new, visitors to Frankfurt can see as far as the historic Old Town from Main Tower's observation platform, before visiting the diverse museums which line the river's embankment. Bavaria attracts visitors from around the world for its rich culture and traditions. Follow the picturesque Romantic Road to discover the state's historic cities, finishing with the magical Neuschwanstein Castle which is set against a breathtaking backdrop of the Alps.
