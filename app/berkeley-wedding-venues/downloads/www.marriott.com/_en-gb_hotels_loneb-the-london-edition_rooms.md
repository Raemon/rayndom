The London EDITION's luxurious rooms and suites are serene havens in the heart of London's Fitzrovia neighborhood. Stylish in their simplicity, yet decadent in their details. The rooms and suites near Soho, provide a home away from home feel while still feeling elevated and luxurious. In the rooms, oak floors and wood-paneled walls surround guests in warmth, while distinct design touches like tufted George Smith lounge chairs, cantilevered desks, gold-framed Hendrik Kerstens photography, and plush throws invite guests to unwind in style. In the suites, airy layouts and abundant natural light create a feeling of openness; several suites take that further by offering furnished terraces with sweeping city views.
