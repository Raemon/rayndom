# Restaurants inspired by the splendor of Koh Samui

## Dining

Koh Samui is known for its fish and shellfish, spices, jasmine rice, rice noodles, rich curries, and pungent dips, brought together with intriguing influences from China, Malaysia, and even India. Each of the restaurants and beach bars in Koh Samui at Vana Belle, a Luxury Collection Resort celebrates this wonderful culinary heritage. At our thatched Pool Bar in Koh Samui, your cocktail can be infused with one of the famed local Thai rums, or you can order a freshly made dish of a Koh Samui favorite like khao phad, Thai fried rice. Visit the Lobby Lounge for an unforgettable view of the Gulf of Thailand while enjoying afternoon tea or crafted cocktails. For a change of pace, sample the al fresco at Kiree, with our chefs preparing a selected menu of European and Asian-inspired dishes, presented in the elegant dining room with beach and sea views or outside amongst the sea breezes on the terrace.

Jib Nam Cha - Signature High Tea

Indelible Afternoon Tea served in a distinctive bird cage with rich sweet and savory bites and choice of premium tea, coffee and juices at Pool Bar or Lobby Lounge every day from 1:00 PM - 6:00 PM.
