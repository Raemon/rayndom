# Experience the fresh cuisine of Punta de Mita

## Dining

Fuel your adventure in Mexico with custom bar cocktails and bold flavors magnified by Punta de Mita’s sunshine and beachside setting. All day every day, Venazú combines authentic Mexican cuisine with a casual yet celebratory atmosphere. Living Room provides light bites and savory sips at any hour. Outside, find refreshing drinks and snacks at WET® Deck. Chevychería serves a seaside restaurant and bar menu of raw seafood, ceviches and craft beers from a converted 1950s Chevrolet 3800 truck. Eat like a local at Salero while soaking in the infinity views next to WET Too. Mesa 1, one of the most exclusive restaurants around, invites you and up to 9 of your closest friends to indulge in a one-of-a-kind, seven-course dinner. On the flip side is our Pan-Asian Spice Market featuring Punta de Mita’s traditional dishes with a creative twist from Chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten.
