### Signature Rituals at the St. Regis Chicago

In 1904, John Jacob Astor IV founded the St. Regis brand and redefined luxurious living. Today, every St. Regis hotel celebrates daily rituals; each is a modern articulation of a timeless tradition, inviting guests to experience not only the St. Regis legacy, but also the story of each hotel. The St. Regis Chicago will offer each of these rituals, adapted ever so slightly to pay tribute to the heritage of the Windy City, crafting each time honored experience into an elevated moment. 

###  The Evening Ritual 

Dating back to the battles of Napoleon Bonaparte, who famously said “Champagne: in victory, one deserves it; in defeat, one needs it”, the art of champagne sabrage is a glittering ceremony which takes place daily at sunset - bidding farewell to the working day and a welcome to the evening.

[ Learn More ](https://st-regis.marriott.com/culture/evening-ritual/)

###  The Bloody Mary 

Invented by Fernand Petiot, at The St. Regis New York in 1934, the Bloody Mary remains the signature cocktail of the St. Regis. Indulge in The 1871 at The St. Regis Chicago, a tribute to the Great Chicago Fire, which incorporates a local Rye Whiskey. The immersive concoction is served in a smoking glass finished with a rim of smoked salt, while the elongated height of its vessel celebrates The St. Regis Chicago.

###  The St. Regis Butler Service 

When John Jacob Astor IV first conceived the St. Regis New York, his vision was to create "the finest hotel in the world.” As such, the St. Regis butler was born out of a mandate to fulfill every guest’s desire as if it were second nature. A signature suite offering, the essence of the storied service is discreet, personalized, anticipatory attention that begins before your stay and extends after you leave.
