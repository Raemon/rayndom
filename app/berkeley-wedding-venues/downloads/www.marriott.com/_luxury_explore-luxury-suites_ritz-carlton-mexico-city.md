Rising high above Paseo de la Reforma, this one-bedroom residence offers a rare sense of calm in the heart of Mexico City, with panoramic views stretching across Chapultepec Park toward the skyline beyond. Designed with a warm, minimalist sensibility, the residence pairs white walls, natural stone and richly grained woods to create a space that embrace's the city's modern dynamism while remaining deeply grounded.

A full kitchen and refined living space anchor the residence, offering a quiet counterpoint to the city below — green by day, illuminated by night. With the privacy of a residence and exclusive access to The Ritz-Carlton’s amenities and service, it is a sanctuary in the sky: intimate, composed and distinctly residential.
