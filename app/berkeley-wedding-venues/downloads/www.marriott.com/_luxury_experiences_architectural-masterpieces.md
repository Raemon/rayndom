The City, Elevated

From the street, The Ritz-Carlton New York, NoMad cuts a commanding silhouette against the skyline, a new icon shaped by the city’s enduring love affair with soaring towers. Recognized for its design by Architectural Digest, the Muse Hotel Awards and the Awards for Hospitality Experience and Design, the architecture here seems to capture Manhattan’s gift for making the sky's limit seem within reach. Inside, the hotel feels like a salute to early New York glamour — geometric shapes, soft light and hushed refinement — a private world suspended just above the rush of Manhattan. Starchitect Rafael Viñoly’s vision is one of air and elevation, a lesson in how a place can soar above the rush.

The Old World in a New Light

In Florence, beauty is a discipline. The city's devotion to classical proportions and detail has endured for centuries. Nowhere is that legacy more artfully reimagined than at The St. Regis Florence, set inside a 15th-century palace designed by Renaissance master Filippo Brunelleschi. The grandeur is unmistakable: frescoed ceilings, soaring arches and sculptural forms, all brought into the present with a modern sensibility. Sumptuous fabrics such as velvet, silk and brocade wrap headboards and armchairs, lending a richness to rooms that feel both timeless and chic. Step onto a private terrace and the Arno River gleams below, as timeless as the city itself.

Where Nature Meets Modernism

Minimalism rarely feels this alive. At The Riviera Maya EDITION at Kanai, designed by Mexico-based design firm Edmonds International, crisp geometric forms rise against a backdrop of sand and sky, their clean lines softened by the lush jungle growing around them. Palms unfurl like emerald fountains, vines spill down concrete walls and tropical plants burst from every corner and courtyard. Inside, the sleek, earth-tone spaces are punctuated by vivid splashes of fuchsia and orange, like fragments of a Mexican sunset. Even the spa, a modernist sanctuary wrapped in soft curves and warm wood, calls with the rhythms of Mayan traditions.

Past Meets Presence 

At first it seems incongruent, a tangle of metal rising from orderly rows of trellising vines at the oldest winery in Spain’s Basque region. Upon closer look, however, the sculptural form begins to soften, its ripples of tempranillo-hued titanium undulating like the surrounding hillsides, glinting in the sun like a crystal wine glass held to a window. The Hotel Marqués de Riscal, a Luxury Collection Hotel, Elciego is, in many ways, textbook Frank O. Gehry — bold, unconventional, blurring the line between function and art — and yet altogether new. It was the first hotel designed by the renowned architect, and an opportunity for him to create both the exterior form and the interior experience.

Hidden Depths

Among the glass-wrapped skyscrapers that dot the Osaka skyline, the all-black monolith that is W Osaka slinks into the shadows — but also shouts to be noticed. It’s a dichotomy drawn from traditional Japanese haori coats, says Osaka-based architecture firm ANDO Tadao, which were black on the outside — modest, minimalist — and a riot of color and texture on the inside. Here, too, the exterior is muted, and the interiors, created in collaboration with Concrete Amsterdam, explode in a cacophony of color: rainbow-hued furnishings, high-energy neon installations, origami motifs and W’s trademark maximalism aplenty.

Humble Beginnings

It only makes sense that in Singapore’s arts and heritage district, a bevy of international design powerhouses — Britain’s Foster and Partners, France’s Phillipe Starck, along with a roster of A-list contemporary artists — would combine to create JW Marriot Hotel Singapore South Beach, a sprawling, towering 634-room behemoth in the city’s buzzing Marina Bay. Guests drawn to its gracefully arcing facade, immersive art installations, verdant sky gardens and sculptural lower-level canopy would never guess that integrated into it all are four restored military buildings dating back to the 1930s — as well as an esplanade of mature trees that once offered shade to soldiers.
