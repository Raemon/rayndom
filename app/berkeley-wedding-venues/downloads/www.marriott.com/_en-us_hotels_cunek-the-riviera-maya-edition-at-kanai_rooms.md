Nature Inspiration

### Sustainable Luxury in the Maya Spirit

Situated in a 620-acre nature reserve, The Riviera Maya EDITION at Kanai introduces a new concept of sustainable luxury to the Caribbean coastline. Designed with a minimal environmental footprint to protect and preserve Kanai’s ecosystem, the ancient land delivers nothing short of its Maya name, “Paradise on Earth”, with its pristine white-sand beaches, lush forest of mangroves and tropical flora. Featuring 182 guest rooms and 30 suites, a lagoon--inspired pool, North America’s largest penthouse suite and versatile private events spaces, Mexico’s first EDITION marries its signature brand of hospitality with the Yucatan Peninsula’s modern and ancient cultures.
