While Las Vegas is synonymous with its bustling city life, it also boasts an array of natural wonders for those in search of a serene escape. The Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area, a mere stone's throw from the city, is a veritable oasis for nature enthusiasts. With its majestic sandstone cliffs, rich wildlife, and a network of trails suitable for every level of hiker, the area offers a peaceful retreat amidst breathtaking scenery. Whether you're an avid trekker or simply seeking a leisurely stroll, the Red Rock Canyon is the perfect setting to immerse yourself in the great outdoors. 

For a nature trip that’s both scenic and educational, head to the Hoover Dam. This engineering marvel is the gateway to the Lake Mead National Recreation Area, which offers a variety of outdoor activities. You can take a boat out on the lake, fish, or kayak, surrounded by desert cliffs and mountains. There are also plenty of hiking and biking trails in the area, including the River Mountains Loop Trail, which offers panoramic views of the lake and desert. Whether you’re looking for a peaceful picnic spot or an adrenaline-pumping adventure, the Lake Mead and Hoover Dam area offers a mix of natural beauty, history, and recreational fun.

The culture in Las Vegas is a dazzling blend of entertainment, art, and vibrant nightlife that keeps the city buzzing 24/7. Marriott Bonvoy's Las Vegas hotels offer a front-row seat to this dynamic atmosphere, with amenities that reflect the city's spirit of luxury and excitement. Whether you're exploring the neon-lit streets of the Strip or delving into the city's rich history at the Mob Museum, you'll find an endless array of cultural experiences. Our hotels provide the perfect base for discovering the city’s iconic landmarks, from the Bellagio fountains to the High Roller Observation Wheel, ensuring you have a memorable stay. 

Art aficionados will be thrilled by the burgeoning arts scene, with galleries and exhibitions that celebrate local and international talent. The Arts District is a must-see, with its vibrant street art, quirky boutiques, and innovative dining options. For a deeper cultural experience, take in a world-class performance at one of the many theaters or explore the Cosmopolitan’s ever-changing art installations. After a day of cultural immersion, you can relax in the comfort of your Marriott Bonvoy hotel, where luxury and style await.

Las Vegas is celebrated for its arid desert climate, promising you a sunny and warm welcome for much of the year. The summer months, from June to August, can be quite toasty, with temperatures often reaching over 100°F (38°C). But fear not, the city is well-equipped with indoor havens, such as the renowned casinos and entertainment venues, to provide a cool escape. Many of our hotels in Las Vegas boast outdoor pools, refreshing spas, and air-conditioned rooms, ensuring your comfort in the heat. Spring and fall, from March to May and September to November, are the prime seasons for a visit, with temperatures ranging from the 60s to 80s°F (15°C to 27°C). These milder seasons are perfect for exploring the city's outdoor delights, from the bustling Las Vegas Strip to the underrated outdoors. 

Las Vegas winters are generally mild, with daytime temperatures in the 50s to 60s°F (10°C to 16°C) and cool nights in the 30s to 40s°F (-1°C to 9°C). While snow is rare, occasional light dustings can transform the surrounding desert landscape into a magical winter wonderland. The cooler weather is perfect for enjoying the city's indoor attractions, such as the world-class shows, museums, and shopping. Whether you're visiting in the heat of summer or the crispness of winter, Marriott Bonvoy's hotels in Las Vegas offer the perfect blend of comfort and convenience to make your stay unforgettable.

Your journey to Las Vegas is met with a plethora of transportation options to ensure a seamless arrival. Most visitors touch down at Harry Reid International Airport, where a swift and comfortable trip to your chosen Marriott Bonvoy hotel is guaranteed, thanks to the many services available, from taxis to Uber and Lyft, and hotel shuttles. If you're driving in, Las Vegas is easily accessible by major highways, offering a straightforward route from nearby cities. And with a comprehensive road network, renting a car is a breeze, with many agencies to choose from at the airport and throughout the city. 

Once you’re in Las Vegas, you’ll find it easy to get around, thanks to the city’s efficient public transportation system. The Regional Transportation Commission (RTC) operates the Las Vegas Strip Bus, which is a convenient and affordable way to see the famous attractions along the Strip. For a more extensive tour of the city, the Deuce bus line serves downtown Las Vegas and other key areas, while the Monorail offers a fast and scenic ride between major hotels and attractions. Taxis and ride-sharing services are also widely available, and many our hotels in Las Vegas are within walking distance of the city’s top destinations, making it easy to enjoy everything Las Vegas has to offer.

White the city is traditionally known for its attractions catered to adults, Las Vegas is a city that never fails to entertain families, offering a wide range of attractions suitable for all ages. Kick off your exploration at the Adventuredome at Circus Circus, an indoor amusement park featuring thrilling rides, live entertainment, with an indoor water close by in Circus Circus. For a more educational experience, the Discovery Children’s Museum is a must-visit, with its hands-on exhibits that spark curiosity and learning through play. With our strategically located Marriott Bonvoy hotels, you're always close to the best family-friendly activities in the city. 

Families will be drawn to the Ethel M Chocolate Factory and Cactus Garden, a tour that culminates in a serene botanical garden where the kids can learn about desert plants and maybe even spot a tortoise. For a truly unique experience, the Shark Reef Aquarium at Mandalay Bay, where the kids can get up close and personal with sharks, rays, and other exotic marine life. After a day of exploration, unwind with a family-friendly meal at one of the city’s many themed restaurants, such as Rainforest Cafe or the House of Blues Restaurant, where the food is as exciting as the atmosphere. Whichever Las Vegas Marriott Bonvoy hotel you decide to book, you will be in the perfect location for nearby family fun and adventure.
