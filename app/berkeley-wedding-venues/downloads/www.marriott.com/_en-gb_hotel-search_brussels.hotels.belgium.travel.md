## City of Brussels – Stunning architecture, quirky fountains

Why not start your visit to Brussels with the wonderful view from the ascenseur des Marolles, a glass lift from Marolles to Place Poelaert on the hill above? The view takes in the monumental Basilique Nationale du Sacré Cœur, the town hall's spire, and Brussels' modern icon, the iron-atom-shaped Atomium, over 6 kilometres away. For another breathtaking vista, the Basilique's dome more than repays you for the climb and the art-deco architecture of one of the world's largest churches is well worth the visit. If museums are your thing, you're in for a treat – there are more than 80 in Brussels, covering wide-ranging topics, including the history of comic strips. Children should enjoy activities at the Coudenberg Palace Archaeological Site, including an underground treasure hunt. For relaxation, check out Brussels' many intimate ‘pocket parks', such as Parc Faider or Square Frère-Orban, or have a chuckle at the Manneken Pis or Le Cracheur water fountains.

## Top Attractions in Brussels

  * ##### Gaze at the lavish architecture in the Grand Place square

Arriving at this beautiful square, the first thing to strike you will be a magnificent view of the architecture. From the church-like Hôtel de Ville with its extravagant spire to the similarly styled Maison du Roi opposite, or the ornate golden decoration of buildings at both ends of the square, there are fabulous structural features all around.You might notice the culinary nature of some street names around the square (Rue au Beurre, Rue Chair et Pain). These date from the square's historical use as a marketplace, reflecting different parts of the market. 

  * ##### Browse chic boutiques and a vibrant market in Châtelain

The Place du Châtelain's bustling market is the place to be on Wednesday afternoons, with all kinds of fresh produce and trendy trinkets on offer. Locals hang out here after work, sampling wares from the stands. With restaurants of all sorts lining the Rue du Page, this fashionable area is also a pick for food lovers.There are dozens of elegant boutiques to appeal to shopaholics and the neighbourhood's sophistication is elevated by the presence of the Musée Horta. The former residence of Art Nouveau pioneer, Victor Horta, the building's interior features the architect's characteristic sweeping curves, asymmetric details and delightful skylights. 

  * ##### Enjoy exotic food and cultural treats at Place Flagey

Place Flagey's large square makes it a perfect venue for the weekend market where locals gather to shop for local produce and multicultural flavours. The market's diversity is reflected in local restaurants, with Portuguese, Japanese and Moroccan cuisine just some of the nearby offerings.Culture enthusiasts will appreciate the Flagey Arts Centre for film festivals and screenings as well as the Théâtre Marni with live shows across a wide range of genres.To the south of Place Flagey, many an hour may be happily spent watching nature or the play of the fountains on the Étangs d'Ixelles (Ixelles Ponds). 

  * ##### Have a grand day out hunting antiques at Grand Sablon

Sablon (‘Zavel' in Flemish) is a lively part of Brussels, centred around the Place du Grand Sablon, the Place du Petit Sablon and the Église Notre-Dame du Sablon with fabulous stained glass.Bargain-hunters will want to check out Grand Sablon's antiques market that happens every Saturday and Sunday. Art lovers might investigate Sablon's dozens of modern art galleries and, on Sablon's outskirts, the Musées royaux des Beaux-Arts de Belgique.Satisfy your sweet tooth enjoying Belgium's famous chocolates on Grand Sablon, and relax near the Peter Pan Statue in Parc Egmont or surrounded by statues in Petit Sablon.
