## Cape Town - Breathtaking natural beauty

Cape Town is the oldest urban area in South Africa. The city was originally developed by the Dutch East India Company as a stop off for ships sailing around the Cape of Good Hope and on into the Indian Ocean. The imposing flat-topped Table Mountain dominates the city's skyline, and cable cars climb to the top providing travelers with breathtaking views across the city and busy harbor. From here, boats depart for Robben Island, the notorious prison that once held Nelson Mandela, now converted into a living museum. Cape Town offers a plethora of things to do, including the V&A Waterfront for shopping and entertainment, or historic sites such as the Dutch-built, Castle of Good Hope. Excellent beaches can also be accessed from here, ranging from ritzy Clifton Beach to Boulders Beach, home to a penguin colony. Popular out-of-town trips take in Chapman's Peak Drive, and the Cape of Good Hope.

## Top Attractions in Cape Town

  * ##### Nature at Table Mountain

Surrounded by a national park filled with ostriches, baboons, and endangered flora and fauna, this mountainous plateau gives visitors a captivating panorama of Cape Town surrounded by the area's striking natural beauty. Ascend to the top of this iconic mountain by cable car and marvel as the city shrinks and the flat peak rises into view. Admire the panoramic views across the city and the cape from the peak, or adventurous souls may wish to discover the hiking routes that wind through the area, crossing gorges, ravines, and valleys. Here you can see the national park's wide array of natural treasures in their natural habitat. 

  * ##### The V and A Waterfront

Discover Cape Town's V and A Waterfront, a lively hub of shopping and cuisine in one of the city's most picturesque locations. This working harbour is a prime shopping destination for tourists and locals alike. With plenty of retail options, visitors can easily spend hours exploring fashion, housewares, jewellery, leather goods, and souvenirs before sitting down for a meal at one of the many restaurants and cafes. End the day with a sunset cruise around the harbour or explore the Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa. 

  * ##### Cape Point Nature Reserve

Experience the beautiful nature and striking scenery of Cape Point Nature Reserve. The reserve is crossed by spectacular hiking trails that weave through protected bushland that is home to a multitude of rare plants, birds and animals. Spend the day exploring the hiking trails independently or with a knowledgeable local guide. You'll learn a lot about the park's unique ecosystems in this vibrant setting. Visitors can also make their way to the cliffs at Cape Point and the Cape of Good Hope to view the rugged Atlantic coastline or take the funicular to experience the stunning views from Cape Point Lighthouse. 

  * ##### Time to relax at Clifton Beaches

Soak up the sun and scenery with a visit to Clifton Beaches. Located a short drive around the coast from Cape Town, Clifton's four beaches are among the best in South Africa, with Clifton's 4th beach being awarded blue flag status for excellence. Discover bleached white sands offering spectacular views of the Atlantic Ocean on this sheltered stretch of coast. Its year-round visitors enjoy all manner of water sports and beach activities.
