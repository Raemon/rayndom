##  Explore London with Marriott 

## Top Attractions in London

  * ##### See the Crown Jewels at the Tower of London

See the dazzling Crown Jewels, marvel at Henry VIII's royal armour in the White Tower or simply stroll around the walls – all at the UNESCO-listed Tower of London. London's famous monument was built by William the Conqueror in 1066 and sits proud on the River Thames, both fortress and historic gateway to the capital. A total of 20 towers make up the complex, so there's plenty to see and do. Among them is Tower Green, where Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard were executed. On a lighter note, you can take a photo of the Tower's famous Beefeaters in their black and red uniforms. 

  * ##### Step back in time at the Churchill War Rooms

Uncover the secrets of the Second World War at the Churchill War Rooms on London's King Charles Street. You'll walk through the hidden underground corridors where Winston Churchill and his inner circle directed operations, and even stop in the room where Churchill used to record broadcasts to the British public during the war.The museum is one of the five branches of the Imperial War Museum and is home to a whopping 800,000 items that tell the story of modern war and conflict. Here you can browse everything from trench journals to propaganda leaflets. 

  * ##### Snap photos of iconic Westminster Abbey

This Gothic church in the City of Westminster encompasses over 1,000 years of history, so it's no wonder it holds UNESCO Heritage status. The Abbey was built in 960 AD and has been a royal coronation site since 1066. It's the resting place of more than 3,000 great Britons, too, including King Henry V and Queen Elizabeth I. Visit the Coronation Chair, where over 100 poets and writers are buried or have memorials, including William Shakespeare. Take in the vibrant colours of The Queen's Window or wander like generations of medieval monks before you, along the Cloisters. 

  * ##### Shop for fresh food at Borough Market

You can't visit London without a trip to Borough Market – one of the largest and oldest food markets in London, with a site dating back to the 12th century.Wander the bustling, colourful stalls and find both traditional British produce and regional specialities from around the world. You'll find everything from fruit and vegetables to spices, oils and vinegars. Farmers, fisherman and bakers – many of the stallholders have their own produce on offer. Other traders have built their reputations on seeking out small-scale artisan producers and bringing their wares to Borough Market.
