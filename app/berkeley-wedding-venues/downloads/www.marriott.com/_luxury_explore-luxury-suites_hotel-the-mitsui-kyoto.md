HOTEL THE MITSUI KYOTO is located in the heart of Kyoto. Adjacent to the iconic Nijo-jo Castle, the hotel occupies the former Kyoto estate of the Kitake family, the executive branch of the Mitsui dynasty. For over 250 years, this site served as the family's residence. The tranquility and storied history of the location is reflected in our accommodation in Kyoto, Japan. Located on the highest floor of the property and measuring 213 square meters, the Presidential Suite at HOTEL THE MITSUI KYOTO is one of the most spacious suites in Kyoto. With separate living room and bedroom areas, the suite also features a dining area and pantry that can seat up to 10 people comfortably. Guests look out onto the Nijo-jo Castle World Heritage Site as well as enjoying an unparalleled view of the mountains that surround the city.

Taking its name from Nijo-jo Castle, the eponymous suite commands a breathtaking view of the castle itself, including designated important cultural assets such as the East Main Entrance Higashi Otemon Gate and the Sumi Yagura Watchtower located in the southeast corner of the compound. At night, the castle entrance and walls are lit up — the whole scene seems to float in front of the two large windows of the Nijo Suite — a magnificent view worthy of this luxurious suite at the THE MITSUI KYOTO.
