# Dive into Our Garden Room and Featured Suites

## Signature Accommodations

HOTEL THE MITSUI KYOTO is located adjacent to the iconic Nijo-jo Castle in the heart of Kyoto. For more than 250 years, this site served as the residence of the Kitake family, the executive branch of the Mitsui dynasty. The tranquility and storied history of the location is reflected today in every guest room. A modern reimagining of the traditional Japanese tearoom, the 160 guest rooms feature carefully chosen natural materials, elevated using artisanal skills. Select suites feature access to a natural onsen for bathing and relaxation, sourced from an on-site spring. Guests can experience Kyoto’s rich history and traditions whilst unwinding in luxurious surroundings.

### Nijo Suite

The featured suite, situated adjacent to Nijo Castle, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, offers a premier front row seat for exploring the ancient capital in Japan.

Nijo Suite 

## Immerse Yourself in the Timeless Ambiance of Our Nijo Suite

Taking its name from Nijo Castle, the eponymous suite commands a breathtaking view of the castle itself, including designated Important Cultural Assets, such as the Higashi Otemon (Great Eastern Gate) and the Sumi Yagura Watchtower, located in the southeast corner of the compound. Measuring over 112m2 (1,205 sqf), the suite consists of separate living room and bedroom areas. At night the castle entrance and walls are lit up – the whole scene seemingly floating in front of the two large windows of the Nijo Suite – a magnificent view worthy of this luxurious suite.
