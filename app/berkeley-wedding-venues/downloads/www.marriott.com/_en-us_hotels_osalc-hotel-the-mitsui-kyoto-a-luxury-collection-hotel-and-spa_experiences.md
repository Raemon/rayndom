# Experience our Kyoto hotel with private onsen

## Experiences

As the imperial capital of Japan for over 1000 years, Kyoto is a profoundly rich locus of Japanese history and culture. It remains the cultural heart of the country, having introduced many Japanese cultural cornerstones such as the "Way of Tea," or the traditional tea ceremony, calligraphy, and various other traditional arts. The city is home to UNESCO World Heritage Sites and countless ancient temples and shrines. At our hotel near Nijo-jo Castle, we put our heart into making your stay a memorable one, offering seasonal opportunities and activities for guests to capture and experience the unique culture and history of this ancient capital.
