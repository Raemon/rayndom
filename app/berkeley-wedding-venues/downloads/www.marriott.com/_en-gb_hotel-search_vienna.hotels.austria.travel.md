## Visit Vienna and be moved by the City of Music

Located on the River Danube, Vienna, or Wien as it is known locally, is not only the birthplace of many artistic and musical masterpieces. It is also the perfect fusion of imperial and modern architecture, celebrating both its iconic past and an innovative future. Trace the intellectual legacy of its greats, such as Mozart, Beethoven and Freud, whilst enjoying its renowned coffee culture and appreciation of the finer things in life. Home of the Wiener Schnitzel, floating gardens and an A to Z of things to do, from the Aquarium to the Zoom Children's Museum, Vienna will delight and inspire you. From walking the streets of the Innere Stadt to braving the heights of the Danube Tower, don't miss an opportunity to absorb all that Austria's capital has to offer, possibly even igniting your own creative spark!

## Top Attractions in Vienna

  * ##### An imperial lifestyle awaits at Schloss Schönbrunn

Considered the most important cultural asset Austria has to offer, Schloss Schönbrunn is its most popular tourist attraction and a must-see when visiting the capital. Once the centre of the city's court life, a fascinating history hides within its walls.The beautiful baroque architecture is accentuated by the Palace's original furnishings and décor that adorn each of the 1441 themed rooms, one of which was the setting for Mozart's first concert at the age of six.After exploring the Palace, step outside into its extensive gardens that include an orangery, a maze, a vineyard and even a zoo. 

  * ##### Everything under one roof, at the Kunsthistorisches Museum

The Kunsthistorisches Museum's impressive building, the mirror image of the Natural History Museum opposite, houses an epic maze of art history covering five millennia, from Ancient Egypt to the Modern Era.Originally designed to display Austria's imperial art, it is now home to paintings, sculptures, photographs, bronzes, clocks, coins and antiquities that span the ages, inviting visitors to see how the collections themselves developed over time. It is also famous for the world's largest collection of Bruegel's artwork.To avoid getting completely lost, take a guided tour or use an audio guide to navigate your way through art history. 

  * ##### Past traditions and future innovations at the Wiener Staatsoper

Home to the Vienna State Ballet and Philharmonic Orchestra, Wiener Staatsoper, or State Opera, is internationally renowned for a world-class, diverse programme of over 300 performances a year, boasting the world's largest repertoire.Whether you are a fan of opera or a novice, the opulent ambiance is unmissable, from the moment you step inside the original and impressive lobby. Meanwhile the interactive displays in the seats will make your experience more accessible.After the curtain comes down, take a tour of this magnificent building, listen to its stories and even gain access backstage and to the highly regarded Emperor's Salon. 

  * ##### Explore St. Stephen's Cathedral from top to bottom

Regarded as the symbol of Vienna, the 12th century gothic structure of St. Stephen's Cathedral stands proud at the centre of the city, with its intricate and colourfully-tiled roof displaying Vienna's coat of arms.Touring the building will unveil its towering pillars, stunning stained-glass windows, ornate mouldings and hidden treasures. Next, climb the 343 steps to the top of the 500 metre South Tower and witness a view across the city unlike any other.After seeing Europe's second largest, free-swinging, chiming church bell, dive into the depths of the catacombs, the final resting place of many of Austria's significant figures.
