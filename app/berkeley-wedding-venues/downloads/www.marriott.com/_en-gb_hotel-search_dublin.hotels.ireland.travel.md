## Dublin, Ireland – a city of warmth and soul

Medieval castles and cathedrals, traditional pubs and parks – Dublin has the lot. Ireland's capital packs in art, culture and plenty of character, always leaving you wanting more. Architectural splendours on display include Dublin Castle, built in the 13th century, and St. Patrick's Cathedral. Take a picnic to the landscaped St Stephen's Green and huge Phoenix Park, spend your afternoon spotting animals in Dublin Zoo or get clued up on Irish heritage and culture in the National Museum of Ireland. The best part? The city's almost entirely walkable – nothing's more than a 30-minute stroll away – so despite its wealth and diversity, it retains a charming and traditional small-town feel. Dinky cafes and quirky shops? Yes, it's got those, too.

## Top Attractions in Dublin

  * ##### Taste whiskey at the Jameson Distillery

Ireland and its whiskey go together like its landscape and the colour green. So, a visit to the country's capital wouldn't be the same without a stop at the Jameson Distillery. Founded in 1780, Jameson arguably makes the biggest-selling Irish whiskey in the world. Although distilling no longer takes place at this Bow Street building in Dublin, you can still get clued up on the whiskey-making process – from barley to bottle. As a bonus, you'll get to learn the difference between bourbon, scotch and Irish whiskey. 

  * ##### Little Museum of Dublin – learn the local's story

Want to get to the heart of Dublin? Visit the Little Museum of Dublin. Nicknamed the ‘people's museum', this charming, 18th-century Georgian town house is packed with eclectic treasures donated by Dubliners themselves. Over three floors, there are more than 5,000 artefacts to look at and learn from. They range from James Joyce's death mask to a first edition of Ulysses. Oh, and there's a room entirely devoted to the band U2. Keep a lookout for an unopened bottle of lemonade from 1918. 

  * ##### Tour Trinity College Dublin

Next up is Trinity College Dublin – another must-see for visitors to the Irish capital. Ireland's oldest university, founded in 1592, is home to handsome Georgian and classical architecture. Its esteemed alumni include greats such as Oscar Wilde and Bram Stoker.The campus also boasts several standalone attractions including Dublin's Science Gallery and the Zoological Museum, though the biggest crowd-pleaser is perhaps the Book of Kells, housed in the Trinity College Library. This prized medieval manuscript, created by Irish monks, contains the four Gospels of the New Testament. 

  * ##### Learn the perfect pour at the Guinness Storehouse

Like whiskey, Guinness is also synonymous with Ireland. At the Guinness Storehouse, one of Dublin's most popular attractions, you'll learn all about the history and process behind the country's most famous export over seven exciting, interactive floors. You'll stand at the bottom of the world's largest pint glass, learn that a ‘perfect' pour of Guinness should take 119.5 seconds and more. At the end of your visit, you'll get to sample the dark stuff for yourself, while enjoying panoramic views over Dublin, in the Gravity Bar.
