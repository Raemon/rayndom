L'Envol

###  Wine and Cheese 

The Perfect Complementing Pair. Pair your meals with over 800 wine and Champagne references including red, white, rosé, dessert wines and premium Armagnac and rare cognac selections, some labels being exclusively available at L'Envol and The St. Regis Hong Kong, and more than 100 references for Champagne. Explore also a decadent selection of cheeses served on a cheese trolley, paired with homemade condiments.

###  Bespoke Tableware 

Reflect Contemporary Culinary Compositions. L’Envol’s tablecloth is created by D. Porthault, in a soft toned champagne colour with a delicate pattern of linear ascending effervescence of champagne bubbles, symbolising a spirit of celebration.

###  Special Occasions 

An Intimate and Personalised Dining Experience. Apart from a private dining room that can sit up to 8 guests, the restaurant can also be fully privatised for curated gatherings and celebrations for up to 50 guests.

Rùn

###  The Fine Art of Chinese Tea 

Be greeted with a welcome tea of the day, each brew can be tailored according to your preference. In summer, a cold infused tea is presented; and a digestif tea is offered at the end of the meal. For a more holistic tea experience, savour our tea-pairing menu that takes you on a gastronomical journey with beautifully crafted tea and food combinations.

###  Intimate Gatherings 

Spark Joy with Comfortable Spaces and Design. For a cosy experience with your loved ones, book one of our two private dining rooms that have statement-making entrance doors, classic circular dining tables with an in-built Lazy Susan and lounge areas. Seating up to 8 and 16 guests respectively, each features a decorative collection of beautifully textured hand woven traditional textiles displayed on an oak frame.

The Drawing Room

###  A Spot of Tea 

A timeless tradition introduced by Mrs Caroline Astor, the mother of the founder of the St. Regis brand John Jacob Astor IV and the grande dame of New York high society during the Gilded Age, relish our reinterpretation of the traditional Afternoon Tea. The first and exclusive in town, you can pick your own choice of savouries and sweets based on your preferences from a dim sum-inspired trolley.

###  Champagne Sabrage 

Join us in celebrating the transition from day to night with our signature St. Regis champagne sabrage ritual, a ritual dating back to Napoleon Bonaparte, who famously opened champagne with his saber in both victory and defeat. The saber is custom-made for The St. Regis Hong Kong by Sylvain Pintus, the Chief Maréchal des Logis of the French Republican Guard, to replicate the original saber used by Napoleon.

###  Astor Terrace 

Cool and verdant, the adjacent Astor Terrace is a peaceful, inviting, open-air haven with al fresco custom-made banquette seating, striking sculpture installations and an ornamental garden extension to The Drawing Room. Encounter a stunning marble water feature which leads to a 2.5-metre high moon gate, a traditional element in Chinese gardens.

The St. Regis Bar

###  Canto Mary 

Sample our own rendition of signature Bloody Mary, named Canto Mary, which celebrates the quintessence of Cantonese culture. Local ingredients include "chen pi" (dried tangerine peel), Kowloon soy sauce and Chinese five-spice mix, all tracing back to the travels of spice traders lured to the coastline of Wan Chai and are reminiscent of the rich amalgam of flavours in Chinatown kitchens.

###  The Savoir-Faire of Glassware 

Created exclusively by Cristallerie de Paris which specialises in producing high quality tableware and decorative objects, the pattern of the glassware at The St. Regis Bar is a tribute to the rich St. Regis legacy, and to Mrs Caroline Astor, the mother of the St. Regis founder Mr John Jacob Astor IV, who loved diamonds and often adorned herself with her collection of diamond jewelry.

###  Cigar Experience 

Enjoy an exquisite collection of bespoke cigars at the Astor Terrace, with over 500 cigars and 25 brands available including the limited edition St. Regis private labels from Esteli and other regions such as Nicaragua, Dominican Republic and Honduras. Everything is bespoke and tailor-made, including St. Regis branded Cristallerie de Paris ashtrays, own branded cigar lighter and the branded humidor.
