Set directly along the ocean’s edge, the iconic Royal Pacific Suite places the Pacific at the center of the experience — in the shifting light, the open horizon and the sound of the sea just beyond the lanai.

Recently reimagined, this two-bedroom penthouse residence opens to an expansive outdoor terrace spanning the length of the suite, where mornings arrive in soft color and evenings settle into deep blues and golds. Inside, island-inspired design and local artwork reflect the landscape outside, while generous living spaces are complemented by a full kitchen with top-of-the-line Wolf appliances, a dining area and butler’s pantry.

With the privacy of a residence and seamless access to the resort’s amenities, the Royal Pacific Suite offers a rare, immersive vantage point over Kapalua’s coastline.
