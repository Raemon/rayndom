Sustainability Highlights

###  Water Reduction Initiatives 

One of the primary ways we implement water conservation is with low flow faucet aerators, shower heads, toilets, and urinals. In addition, we focus on educating guests about the importance of water conservation during their stay. Lastly, we ensure the reduction of water usage by implementing water-efficient practices across all departments specifically housekeeping, food and beverage, and landscaping.

###  Energy Reduction Initiatives 

We have a building automation system where we schedule and control all air handler units and have variable frequency drives on air handlers and pumps. In addition, all lighting is LED with Lutron system controls for meeting space and guest room lights. We also control the lighting and AC in unoccupied guestrooms – ensuring our calibrations ensure that these systems don’t come on unnecessarily.

###  Recycling Program 

Our property recycles all cardboard, glass, and plastic. We also offer mixed recycling in all guest rooms allowing guests to place aluminum foil, beverage cartons, cardboard, glass bottles, magazines, metal cans, newspapers, paper, and plastic bottles/containers in designated bins.
