###  Farm-To-Table 

At JW Marriott Orlando, Grande Lakes, we use fresh, organic ingredients from our on-site Primo Garden and Whisper Creek Farm. We partner with local farmers and vendors who prioritize quality, sustainability, and culinary traditions. Reflecting our commitment to great food and the environment.

###  Refined Libations 

JW Marriott Orlando, Grande Lakes offers four bars where you can enjoy a refreshing pint or a cocktail. Experience the unique flavor that comes from local ingredients and expert craftsmanship, where each sip reveals the depth and character created by our skilled mixologists.

###  Seasonal Events 

Celebrate flavors all year at our luxury resort. Our restaurants and bars offer something for everyone, from romantic dinners and family-friendly holiday meals to extravagant buffets. Each season brings a different culinary experience, making every visit special and delicious.

Our Organic Gardens 

At Primo, fresh is the vital relationship between the kitchen and gardens that surround it. It is the morning communication that occurs between the chef and head grower, coordinating the perfect harvest to fit that night's menu and the perfect menu to fit that day's harvest. It's the essence of Orlando fine dining.  
  
The Primo garden has three growing seasons that supply our Orlando Italian restaurant with the freshest ingredients on a daily basis. Fall and spring are considered our hot seasons. During that time, we plant vegetables and herbs that thrive at high temperatures. Even though our winter season is short, the cold growing period provides Primo with squash, cauliflower and different types of lettuce.  
  
What will be on the menu of our Orlando Italian restaurant tonight? For fine dining at its best, stop by Primo and get a taste.
