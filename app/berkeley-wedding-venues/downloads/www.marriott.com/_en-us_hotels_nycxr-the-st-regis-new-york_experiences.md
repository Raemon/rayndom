In honor of the landmark hotel’s 120th anniversary year, Alexis Bittar has created a bespoke collection of jewelry pieces exclusively for the hotel, marking a new chapter in its glamorous history. The collection draws inspiration from Caroline Astor, the legendary Gilded Age socialite and founding patroness of The St. Regis New York, and pays homage to her favorite flower, the American Beauty rose, and her love of pearls. The collection features three pieces – earrings, a necklace, and a brooch – all available exclusively at The St. Regis New York.
