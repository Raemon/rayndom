The Ultimate Experience 

### Oceanview Suites with Balcony

Our Miami Beach hotel suites feature three preset mood modes for lighting and gradient blackout curtains, with automated bedside controls for seamless adjustment. A soft under-bed light belt creates the appearance that our wood bed frames 'float' just above the floor. Seaside-inspired art by French photographer Jean-Phillipe Piter adorns the wooden-paneled walls, while powder room walls feature hand-painted artwork by local Miami artist Juan Manuel Rozas.
