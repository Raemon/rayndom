Set impossibly close to the shoreline, the three-bedroom residence places Bermuda’s turquoise waters at arm’s reach, their color and movement shaping every moment of the stay. Designed to draw the eye outward, the residence opens to sweeping ocean views from living spaces and private balconies, where sea and sky feel ever-present. 

Inside, soft palettes and organic textures echo the coast, while an open-concept kitchen and generous dining area create a natural gathering place for family or friends. Serene bedrooms are complemented by marble bathrooms with deep soaking tubs and rain showers. With full access to the resort’s spa, pool deck and beachfront amenities — and the discreet attentiveness of St. Regis Butler Service — this residence offers an oceanfront experience defined by ease, elegance and connection.
