## Visit Munich, where the traditional and modern stand side by side

As the capital of Bavaria, Munich offers its many visitors a unique experience that's all-at-once steeped in history, bursting with tradition and celebrating the future. Its vibrant cultural scene and colourful, art-covered streets are interspersed with impressive Neo-Renaissance and Art Nouveau architecture. For those interested in history, explore Nymphenburg Palace, the former home of Bavarian monarchs and one Europe's largest palaces. Or, walk in the Devil's footsteps at the Frauenkirche and enjoy “la dolce vita” at the Italian-style Odeonsplatz. Those wishing to grasp Bavarian traditions won't want to miss the Old Town with its boutiques and the Viktualienmarkt and its local specialities and famous maypole. And those looking for something a bit more modern might want to check out the Olympic Park, offering breath-taking views from its tower, the state-of-the-art FC Bayern München stadium, or the German Museum of Masterpieces of Science and Technology, one of the world's largest museums.

##  Explore Munich with Marriott 

## Top Attractions in Munich

  * ##### Experience the heart of Munich in Marienplatz

Not only is it the centre of the city, Marienplatz is also the centre of all social activity in Munich.Located in the Old Town, it is often the starting point for excursions as it's within walking distance of some of Munich's other popular attractions. But there is always something new to see and do in the city's largest square itself.Visit the Spielzeugmuseum, or Toy Museum, absorb the ambiance in one of the many restaurants serving Bavarian classics or marvel at the elaborate façade of the Neues Rathaus, or New Town Hall. If you are lucky, you might even hear the chimes from the famous Munich Glockenspiel. 

  * ##### Lose yourself in the serenity of the English Garden

Stretching from the city centre to its north-eastern limits, Munich's Englische Garten, or English Garden, contains a few more international influences than its name suggests...Complete with a Chinese pagoda, a Greek temple and a Japanese teahouse, you will be forgiven for thinking you've stepped back in time. Perfect for a picnic or a long, relaxing walk full of fresh air, these extensive gardens offer visitors a range of leisure activities.Soak up the sun whilst watching the famous “Eisbach surfers” or listen to traditional Bavarian music. If your feet are in need of rest after a day of sightseeing, you can even take a rickshaw ride. 

  * ##### Discover more than 100 years of iconic history at the BMW Museum

The distinctive four-cylinder tower and bowl-shaped museum bearing the BMW branding are home to both permanent and temporary exhibitions depicting the company's history and the technical development of engines, cars and motorbikes.The fascinating displays will ignite the senses with around 125 of the world's most valuable cars history has to offer alongside prototypes, design schematics, photography and art, all solidifying BMW as a cultural icon.Whilst the museum is a must-see for car enthusiasts, the sleek and futuristic architecture of BMW Welt, or BMW World, just a stone's throw away, is also worth the trip as it perfectly emulates these luxurious, precision motors. 

  * ##### Join in Oktoberfest, a cultural celebration of far more than just beer!

Contrary to popular belief, Munich's Oktoberfest is the world's largest, family-friendly folk festival that celebrates Bavarian culture at its best. First started in 1810 to celebrate a royal wedding, today, this two-week festival has gained international fame, visited by tourists from all around the world.Don your traditional Lederhosen or Dirndl and stroll around the many stalls for a taste of Germany. Sample the Spätzle, Sauerkraut and sausages, and partake in the many games and competitions or enjoy the thrill of a rollercoaster.To discover how it was done over 200 years ago, visit the Oide Wiesn, or Old Meadow, to experience the traditional food and old-fashioned rides.
