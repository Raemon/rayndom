## France – a land of history, scenery, fine dining and wine

From Mediterranean beaches around the Golfe du Lion to the soaring peaks of the Alps, Pyrenees and Massif Central; from prehistoric menhirs and dolmens in Carnac to historic châteaux in the Loire Valley and to modern theme parks. From lively cities to tranquil village communities centred around the local boulangerie and patisserie; from numerous fine dining establishments to countless humble bistros serving quality comfort food; France has attractions to cater to every taste. Kids will love Parc Astérix and Disneyland© Paris. The technologically-minded will be fascinated by Futuroscope and the culturally-inclined by Puy du Fou. Foodies will be spoilt for choice, whether by Paris's approximately 45,000 restaurants, cafés and bars, or a further 40,000 eating establishments around the country. Some may prefer the many historical sites, some a visit to a vineyard with the requisite sampling of the wine produced, while others may simply wish to enjoy France's magnificent scenery.
