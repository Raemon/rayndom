In Nice’s labyrinthine Old Town, Hôtel du Couvent — housed in a 17th century convent — provides a serene, perfectly curated escape awash in quiet beauty and Provence’s trademark impressionistic light. Meditate in the Movement Studio, seek solitude in the cloisters or head to the onsite herbalist for modern remedies — it’s the perfect antidote to the glitz and glam of the French Riviera.

The Singapore EDITION 

The Singapore EDITION takes inspiration from the neighboring UNESCO-lauded Singapore Botanic Garden and Singapore’s “garden city” heritage — its interior spaces, from the lobby conservatory to the rooftop pool, are alive with lush, tropical foliage. Jade velvet banquettes and a green scalloped marble bar set the tone at seafood-forward Frysh, while the rooftop bar is enveloped on all sides by native greenery.

Drawing on inspiration from the grand villas of the Venetian countryside, The Resort at Pelican Hill is a sun-soaked sanctuary spread across 504 acres of rolling California coastline.
