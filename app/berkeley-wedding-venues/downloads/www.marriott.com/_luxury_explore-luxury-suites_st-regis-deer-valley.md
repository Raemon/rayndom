Set alongside the gentle ascent of the resort’s funicular, this residence offers a uniquely cinematic view of life at The St. Regis Deer Valley. From morning to evening, the glide between Snow Park and the Upper Resort becomes part of the experience — an effortless transition from your private retreat to the spa, dining and après-ski moments above.

Inside, warm materials and refined details echo the surrounding Wasatch landscape, creating a sense of calm after days spent on the slopes or trails. Here, movement is graceful, access is seamless and every arrival feels intentional.
