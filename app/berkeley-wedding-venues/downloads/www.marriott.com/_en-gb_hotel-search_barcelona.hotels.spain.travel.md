## Visit Barcelona, the Catalonian capital of art and culture

Nestled between 4.5 km of sandy coastline and the Montserrat mountain range, Barcelona is crammed full of culture, cuisine and art. From the Picasso museum, which houses more than 4,000 of his masterpieces to the Bostik Murals, the first urban art museum, you'll find something to suit all tastes.Dance the night away at one of the city's many music festivals after having wandered the length of its most iconic street, La Rambla, with its many cafés, street food vendors, traditional market stalls and entertainers. Marvel at Gaudí's stunning architecture dotted around the city or showcased in Park Güell, then immerse yourself in history with a trip to the Barri Gòtic, or Gothic Quarter, for a taste of Barcelona's Roman past. The perfect destination for a short break or extended stay, Barcelona is the ideal mix of bustling city and natural landscape – the best of both worlds right at your fingertips.

## Top Attractions in Barcelona

  * ##### The Basílica de la Sagrada Família, 138 years in the making

With completion set for 2026, 144 years after the first cornerstone was laid, the Sagrada Família's epic structure is as impressive as the dedication and drive to finish it.Originally designed in 1882, the concept was taken over by Gaudí a year later, who completely changed its design. Since his death in 1926, construction has been left up to the interpretation of his extensive plans.Today, you can walk through history in the making, see the life of Christ depicted across its three intricate façades and climb one of its eight emblematic towers. Inside is just as imposing and elaborate, packed with religious and natural symbolism. 

  * ##### Casa Batlló, a collision of curves and colours

Another of Gaudí's celebrated masterpieces, Casa Batlló stands proud among the other modernist creations that defined a period in Barcelona known as the Bone of Contention.The original house was redesigned between 1904 and 1906 into a three-dimensional work of art. With its iconic, luminous, multi-coloured façade, it's not hard to see why it's a renowned architectural gem.Explore the ergonomic shapes in this house of curiosities, which draws in and disperses light like a waterfall, and spot other quirky designs inspired by Gaudí's love of the arts and nature, from the scaly, reptilian roof to the balconies shaped like masks. 

  * ##### Palau de la Música Catalana, more than just a music hall

Built between 1905 and 1908 in Barcelona's most beautiful district, Sant Pere, the Palau de la Música Catalana is another exquisite example of Catalan Art Nouveau and the only of its kind to be named a UNESCO World Heritage Site.Described as a magical music box, the world's most distinctive concert hall is an ensemble of decorative arts, comprising ironwork, mosaic, stained glass and sculpture.Take a guided tour to uncover the Palau's secrets and witness the immense organ hovering above the stage, or bask in the glow of its symbolic sun skylight. The more adventurous may even wish to prevent disaster by solving hidden enigmas in an epic escape room. 

  * ##### Get your juices flowing at the Mercat de la Boqueria

Since 1836, the Boqueria market, one of Europe's largest, has been offering the best fresh produce Catalonia has to offer, with over 200 traders selling everything you need and more.Full of life, this market at the heart of Barcelona is a maze of vibrant colours, sights and smells. It's a true sensory overload that even those who aren't looking to shop should witness. Open almost every day, you can find all your favourites whilst making new delicious discoveries.For a more cultural experience, why not take a tapas tour or a cookery class to create your own Catalonian feast?
