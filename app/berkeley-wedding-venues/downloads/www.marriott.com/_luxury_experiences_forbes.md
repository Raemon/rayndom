Dorado Beach, a Ritz-Carlton Reserve

One of only two Forbes 5-star resorts in Puerto Rico, Dorado Beach is a lush paradise on the island’s North Shore. Initially developed by Laurance Rockefeller in 1958, today the property plays host to two pools, three golf courses, the 11-mile Rockefeller Nature Trail and the expansive Spa Botánico, where a fragrant apothecary filled with herbs and flowers gives way to treetop treatment suites.
