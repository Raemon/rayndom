St Regis Rituals

![The Art of Sabrage](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAA4AAAAKCAYAAACE2W/HAAAAFklEQVR42mN8/fpLPQMZgHFU48jWCAD/vyDle0zFdgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)

Evening Ritual 

At The St. Regis, the transition from day to evening is an unforgettable experience. The lights are dimmed, the music changes, and candles are set out. The ceremony of sabrage, where a bottle of sparkling wine is opened with an elegant saber—a ritual dating back to the 19th century—takes center stage. The St. Regis Evening Ritual is presented each evening in the Winter Garden Bar, from 6 pm to 7 pm.

![Café Ginori - Afternoon Tea Ritual ](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAA4AAAAKCAYAAACE2W/HAAAAFklEQVR42mN8/fpLPQMZgHFU48jWCAD/vyDle0zFdgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)

Signature Afternoon Tea 

Since its creation in England in the early 1800s, the afternoon tea ritual is part of the English afternoon. Discover this wonderful tradition and the world of Dammann Frères with the help of our Tea Sommelier while enjoying the delicacies created by our pastry chef. The tea is served at Café Ginori at The St. Regis Florence every day from 3:30 PM to 5:00 PM.

Bloody Mary 

The Bloody Mary is the signature cocktail of the St. Regis brand, with each hotel crafting its own local interpretation of the libation. Grappa from one of Tuscany's most revered wineries gives the Bloody Brunello its unique, earthy character.
