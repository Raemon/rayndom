## Top Attractions in Tel Aviv-Jaffa

  * ##### Appreciate the ancient history of Jaffa Old City

Home to the world's oldest seaport, Jaffa's Old City with its ancient stone buildings and intimate alleyways is steeped in history with a connection to biblical stories and Greek mythology. As a visitor, you will enjoy the area's distinctive art and architecture: The clock tower in the centre of the town square, and the Floating Orange Tree art installation, which pays homage to the role the citrus fruit played in Yaffa's history as an orange producer. Visit the Old Jaffa Museum of Antiques, which sits atop a hill close to the sea and displays ancient archaeological items, as well as exhibiting contemporary art exhibitions. 

  * ##### Enliven your senses at Carmel Market

Shuk HaCarmel or Carmel Market is Tel Aviv's largest market, selling everything from fruit, vegetables and spices to clothing and electronics. Experience the bustle and hustle of Shuk HaCarmel, which you can easily access in the centre of the city. If you're a fan of electronic gadgets, you will find these at the top end of the market. Keep walking to the lower end to discover a vibrant array of food and fresh produce. Taste local cuisine at the fast-food counters, or take a seat at one of the authentic street-side eateries and informal restaurants. 

  * ##### Relax beside the Mediterranean at Old Tel Aviv Port Area

Old Tel Aviv Port was a bustling destination for imports and exports until its closure during the 1960's. In recent years the port has been transformed into a lively entertainment area, where the wooden boardwalk shaped like waves is lined with quaint cafes, boutiques and high-street names. Sample traditional dishes at one of the many bars and restaurants overlooking the tranquil shores of the Mediterranean, or purchase local agricultural produce and everything organic at the Farmers Market. When the sun sets, the strip of nightclubs and bars transform the Port Area into an equally lively evening destination. 

  * ##### Experience Rothschild Boulevard's classic and contemporary charm

Rothschild Boulevard, elegantly lined with trees and benches, is nestled in the bustling centre of White City, and is one of Tel Aviv's oldest and most iconic streets. The history of the area remains evident with the traditional architecture of Independence Hall, whilst luxury residences and contemporary skyscrapers give the long Boulevard an air of sophistication. With a diverse array of landmarks and destinations, Rothschild Boulevard is home to Israel's national theatre and the Fredric Mann Auditorium, where you can enjoy a performance by the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra. Discover Rothschild Boulevard's numerous gastronomic options, ranging from fine dining restaurants to casual coffee kiosks.
