### Meet Me in Koh Samui

The earliest maps of Koh Samui—the third largest island in Thailand—date back to the late 17th century, when the area served as a haven for fishermen, sailors, and sea traders who traversed the Gulf of Siam and found refuge on its verdant shores. Today, Vana Belle is nestled among these lush enclaves on the enchanting Chaweng Noi Beach.
