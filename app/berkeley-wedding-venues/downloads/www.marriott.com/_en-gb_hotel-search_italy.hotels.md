## Italy – Sunshine, Sea and Renaissance Architecture

From ski resorts in the snow-capped northern mountains, to miles and miles of sun-drenched beaches stretching down to the south, water plays a significant role in this narrow peninsula's attractions. Ride a gondola through the canals of Venice, gaze at the lush landscape around tranquil Lake Como or engage in water sports in warm Mediterranean coastal waters. Children and adults will enjoy Gardaland, a theme park next to Lake Garda. And then there's the architecture. Italy's heritage is second to none. From early Greek and Etruscan settlements, ancient Rome with its aqueducts, baths and Colosseum, to the Renaissance, and on to modern constructions, numerous architectural philosophies have left a rich variety of landmarks, including the infamous Romanesque ‘leaning' Tower of Pisa. After a long day of sightseeing, settle down to enjoy Italy's distinctive cuisine. Pizza, pasta and so much more make Italy an essential destination for food lovers.
