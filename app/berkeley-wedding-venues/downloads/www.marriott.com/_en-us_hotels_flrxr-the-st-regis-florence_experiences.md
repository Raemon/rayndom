With The St. Regis Florence’s prime location on the banks of the Arno River, a stay at our luxury hotel near Ponte Vecchio places you in the center of enchantment. The most famous arch bridge in Florence is noted for still having shops built along it, as was once common, and its viewpoints present stunning vistas at sunrise and sunset.

Artisan studios, art dealers, jewelers, and designer shopping tempt the shopping passionate, while gastronomes will enjoy the delights to be savored in the city’s bars, restaurants, and nearby wineries. When it’s time to relax, unwind with a treatment at our spa hotel in Florence.

## UNESCO World Heritage

Florence is known as the "cradle of renaissance" - la culla del Rinascimento, for its monuments, churches and buildings. The historical center of Florence is named a UNESCO World Heritage site since 1982. Best known sites are the domed cathedral Santa Maria del Fiore, also known as the Duomo, built by Filippo Brunelleschi. It was begun in 1296 and completed structurally in 1436. The exterior is faced with polychrome marble panes in various shades of green, pink and white and has an elaborate 19th century Gothic revival façade. The basilica is one of the largest in Italy and with the complex of the Baptistery and the Giotto's Campanile is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site.
