The hotel is located on the site of the former Aburakoji Residence, the Kyoto home of the executive branch of the Mitsui family. At the heart of the traditional family structure stood the Okusho-in, also known as the SHIKI-NO-MA, offering breathtaking, year-round garden views. This event venue in Kyoto served as the Mitsui family's venue for entertaining distinguished guests.

Private Dining & Celebrations 

### SHIKI-NO-MA

This is a modern yet faithful reconstruction of the original Okunosho-in using Japanese cypress. Today, this room may be used for celebrations, as well as private dining in Kyoto. So'oku Sen, heir apparent to the iemoto (headmaster) position of Mushakouji Senke, oversaw the tasteful elements within the room. These include the alignment of tatami mats to accommodate a traditional ro sunken hearth and the design features of the tokonoma alcove. The SHIKI-NO-MA remains a special place to embrace serenity in the Way of Tea, with the captivating beauty of the gardens.
