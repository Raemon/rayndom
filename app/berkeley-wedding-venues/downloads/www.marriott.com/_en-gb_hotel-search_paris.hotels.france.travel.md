## Paris – Old-world traditions meet modern culture

The City of Lights needs little introduction, famed for iconic attractions like the Arc de Triomphe and Eiffel Tower. Yet its true charms lie off the beaten path, tucked away in lamplit plazas and terraced gardens. Moody jazz bars, concept homeware boutiques and cluttered antique bookshops line the city's leafy, cobbled streets. Old meets new in Parisian architecture, with neoclassical palaces positioned next to sleek, contemporary gallery spaces. The Louvre's modernist glass pyramid and egg-shaped La Seine Musicale create an intriguing juxtaposition next to the Gothic towers of Notre Dame. Dining in Paris is a true pleasure. Whether you make a night of it in a Michelin-starred kitchen or enjoy a to-go from a tucked-away patisserie, you'll find memorable meals at every turn here. Spend the morning browsing the colourful produce at an open-air market before sharpening your skills with an afternoon culinary course.

## Top Attractions in Paris

  * ##### Notre Dame de Paris – The heart of the city

Notre Dame Cathedral sits at the centre of Paris, nestled in the Ile de la Cité. Its grand façade is hard to miss, with flying buttresses, expressive gargoyles and imposing double towers. The cathedral is a masterwork of Gothic architecture, capped with the 13-ton ‘Emmanuel' bell. Three stories in height, its massive doors feature intricate carvings along with a row of Old Testament figures. Ornate 13th-century glasswork lends a hint of reflective shimmer to the rose windows of its magnificent exterior. 

  * ##### Eiffel Tower – Inspiring views from a soaring height

Skyscrapers are rare in Paris, putting the Eiffel Tower head and shoulders above neighbouring monuments. It may be hard to imagine the city without this iconic piece of architecture, but it was only meant to be temporary. Gustave Eiffel designed the tower for the 1889 World's Fair, but it has ended up charming visitors for well over a century. Enjoy its art nouveau metalwork on the journey to the top, whether reached by lift or by climbing its 720 steps. Once there, treat yourself to a macaron as you take in the hustle and bustle below. 

  * ##### Louvre Museum – A treasure trove of Western art

Stroll through its airy courtyard, capped with an iridescent glass pyramid, and you'll step back in time to discover centuries of world-class art. The Louvre Museum holds thousands of paintings and sculptures within its hallowed halls, from Greek and Roman antiquities to Renaissance masterpieces. Once a medieval fortress, the Louvre was rebuilt as a royal palace in the 16th century. It's served the people of Paris as a national museum since 1793, showcasing priceless works of art from Botticelli, Raphael, Michelangelo, and of course, da Vinci with his Mona Lisa. 

  * ##### Montmartre – Parisian charm at its quirky best

Its cobbled streets and cosy bistros give Montmartre a traditional fairy-tale charm, but this hillside neighbourhood has long been the refuge for avant-garde bohemians, from Picasso to van Gogh. Home to the Moulin Rouge, Montmartre's cafes and theatres still buzz with life today and contemporary artists gather in galleries like the Halle Saint-Pierre. The Sacre-Coeur basilica sits at the top, its bright white façade and Byzantine structure giving way to panoramic views. Stroll up the hill to discover Montmartre's hidden gardens and leafy village squares, or take the shortcut via Place Saint-Pierre's funicular.
