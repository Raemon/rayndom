## Madrid - Spain's capital city has something for everyone.

Check out a wide range of architectural styles Spain's capital has to offer, from the immense and stately Royal Palace of Madrid, to the Las Ventas bullring which evokes ancient Islamic architecture. Why not pick up a bargain from one of the 3000 stalls at El Rastro flea market? Keen foodies might prefer the fresh produce of the Mercado San Miguel historical market, to visit a tapas bar or to sample churros or bocadillo de calamares from one of the city's many snack bars and cafés. Sports fans will relish the chance to tour the Bernabeu or Wanda Metropolitano stadiums, while the nearby amusement parks and zoos have plenty to offer children. In the evening, settle down at a flamenco bar to enjoy a fine meal while talented dancers perform Spain's national dance.

## Top Attractions in Madrid

  * ##### Spend a day, or several, at the Museo del Prado

Holding more than 7000 paintings, of which only around 1500 are exhibited at any one time, El Prado is a feast for art lovers. While it specialises in Spanish painters, there's also a substantial collection of Flemish art and pictures by other celebrated artists.The modern eastern wing (Edificio Jerónimos), which opened in 2007, showcases temporary exhibitions, often of Prado masterpieces normally held in storage. The original western wing (Edificio Villanueva) meanwhile presents works including Goya's Pinturas Negras, Velázquez's royal portraits and Rubens' The Three Graces, all on permanent display.There's so much to see here, that a single visit may not be enough. 

  * ##### Parque del Retiro – Catch your breath at the city's heart

Covering over 300 acres and home to more than 15,000 trees, Madrid's largest park is the perfect place to relax on hot summer days.From the west of the park, walk along the Paseo de la Argentina, lined with 18th-century statues of Spain's monarchs, towards the man-made lake where you can rent a boat or gaze upon the breathtaking Alfonso XII monument.You won't want to miss the park's stunning glass pavilion or the Angel Caido fountain, while children will enjoy the play areas dotted around and the puppet shows held every weekend at the Teatro de Titeres. 

  * ##### Travel through time at Museo Nacional Thyssen-Bornemisza

Start at the top floor of the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum and take a journey through art history, from 14th-century Italian Primitives to the ground floor, where major painters of the 20th century are represented. On your way, pass by 17th-century Dutch portraits, 19th-century Impressionism and Interwar Realism.Medieval art is strongly represented, with highlights being Van Eyck's ‘Diptych of the Annunciation', which creates a powerful 3D effect, and Holbein's stern portrait of Henry VIII. A hallucinatory piece by Dalí is one of the 20th century's standout works.Don't forget to pop across to the extension to view the Carmen Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection. 

  * ##### Gran Via – The place to go shopping in style

The place to go for all your shopping needs, Gran Via is home to El Corte Inglés, Spain's largest department store, as well as many other outlets from boutiques selling luxury or local items to high-street brand establishments.But Gran Via is not just somewhere to part with your cash; it's also a place where you can experience yet more stunning architecture, from the Beaux-Arts style of the Edificio Metrópolis with its cupola dome and winged statue, to the Rationalist-Expressionist style of the Edificio Carrión.Alternatively, let yourself be entertained at one of Gran Via's many theatres and cinemas.
