## Be enchanted by Edinburgh, Scotland's historic capital

With its unmistakable architecture and quaint cobbled streets and alleys, Edinburgh is a lively city brimming with history. Admire the rugged highland landscape while exploring Holyrood Park or experience the bustle of Scotland's capital with a walk down the Royal Mile, which links the historic Edinburgh Castle with the Palace of Holyrood. The Old Town has plenty of character, with a maze of narrow streets and passageways you will deliberately get lost in. As a melting pot of culture, Edinburgh also hosts its annual Fringe Festival, which vibrantly showcases the city's rich heritage and appreciation of the arts. You can also experience this by visiting Edinburgh's many museums, galleries and jazz clubs.

##  Explore Edinburgh with Marriott 

## Top Attractions in Edinburgh

  * ##### Admire Edinburgh from above at Arthur's Seat

Escape from the bustle of the city to an oasis of calm at Arthur's Seat. Nestled within Holyrood Park, Arthur's Seat is an ancient volcano and the highest of a group of hills offering unrivalled views of the capital below. You can reach the summit via different routes, each allowing you to take in the rough surrounding landscapes. On your way up, make sure you attend the free exhibition on the park's history and geology, and admire the Iron Age fort and medieval ruins of St Anthony's Chapel. After you've finished taking in the views, visit the nearby Palace of Holyrood - the Queen's official Scottish residence. 

  * ##### Re-live the city's history at Edinburgh Castle

Edinburgh Castle has become a distinctive part of Edinburgh's skyline, perching high above the capital. The castle provides a captivating insight into history dating back to the 12th century. Admire the Honours of Scotland, view Britain's oldest Crown Jewels, and imagine yourself in a medieval banquet in The Great Hall, and appreciating its opulence. You'll also find the National War Museum, which is home to an array of fascinating artefacts used by Scottish forces throughout history. Try to visit in the afternoon to witness the unmistakable sound of the One O'Clock Gun, which is fired daily at exactly 1pm. 

  * ##### Enjoy a taste of Edinburgh at The Scotch Whisky Experience

At the top of the Royal Mile, make your way to The Scotch Whisky Experience, the ultimate destination for appreciating this traditional Scottish beverage. Choose from several packages to tour this top attraction and view the high-tech exhibits. Take a whisky barrel ride, which brings the distillery process to life through an interactive journey. Marvel at the glass and marble vault containing the world's largest collection of Scotch whisky. Here you can enliven your senses further with a tasting session or a five-course Scottish dining experience. Each course is matched to a whisky recommended by a knowledgeable Whisky Sommelier for a perfect pairing of flavours. Blend your very own whisky at the Scotch Whisky Training School, or treat your tastebuds to local cuisine at the Amber Restaurant and Whisky Bar. 

  * ##### Take a trip down the Royal Mile in the heart of the city

Running through the centre of Edinburgh's Old Town, the Royal Mile is one of Britain's most recognisable streets connecting two royal residences: Edinburgh Castle and the Palace of Holyroodhouse. Along the mile, an array of shops, restaurants, pubs and cafes are lined up waiting for you to drop in to buy traditional tweed and tartan or sample Scottish food and drink. Explore the cobbled alleys that run off the Royal Mile, and discover hidden treasures at the independent and specialty shops. Enhance your understanding of this historic street with a walking tour of your choice, with specialist options ranging from literature to the paranormal.
