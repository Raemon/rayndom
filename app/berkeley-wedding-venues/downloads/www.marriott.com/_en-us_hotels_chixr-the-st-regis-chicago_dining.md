## The 1871 Bloody Mary

This version of the classic Bloody Mary pays tribute to one of the most impactful events in Chicago history, the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, capturing the essence of Chicago’s rich, but complex history. The 1871 features a bold bloody mary mix, which incorporates a local Rye Whiskey. The immersive concoction is served in a smoking glass finished with a rim of smoked salt, while the elongated height of its vessel celebrates The St. Regis Chicago, the tallest building in the world designed by a female architect. Invented by famed barman Fernand Petiot at The St. Regis New York in 1934, the Bloody Mary remains the signature cocktail of St. Regis. Once rechristened the "Red Snapper” as the name Bloody Mary was deemed unrefined for the hotel's elegant clientele, today, each St. Regis address crafts its local interpretation of the libation to pay homage to Petiot's original recipe.
