Garden Greeters offer a warm welcome and helpful orientation for our visitors on weekends and holidays. They ensure our visitors have the best possible experience by handing out maps, and offering general information as well as games for children to help them get to know the Garden. These positions are open to all interested volunteers and the training is free.

Our next Garden Greeter training will take place on Saturday, March 28 and Saturday, April 4, both from 9:00 AM - 11:00 AM and both dates are required. To learn more and to apply for the training, send an email to [greeter_coordinator@nativeplants.org](mailto:greeter_coordinator@nativeplants.org?).
