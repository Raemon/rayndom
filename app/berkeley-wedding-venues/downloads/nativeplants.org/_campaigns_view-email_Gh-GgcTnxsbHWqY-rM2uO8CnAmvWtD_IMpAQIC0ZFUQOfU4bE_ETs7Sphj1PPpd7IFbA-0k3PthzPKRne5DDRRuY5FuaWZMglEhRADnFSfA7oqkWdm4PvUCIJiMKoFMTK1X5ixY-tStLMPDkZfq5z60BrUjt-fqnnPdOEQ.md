#### **Wildcat Creek Erosion Control Project**

 _By Bart O’Brien_ In late 2025, the Park District, Botanic Garden, and ETIC (the contractor) completed a sustainable erosion control project along a vulnerable northern section of Wildcat Creek. Designed by civil engineer Scott Stoller, the project utilized ecological restoration techniques rather than traditional concrete walls (as was done decades ago in the older parts of the Botanic Garden) to stabilize a steep slope threatened by high water flows.**Project Implementation & Methods**

  * Bio-engineering: The slope was stabilized using overlapping bundles of native creek dogwood and willow stems, alongside upright willow “poles.”
  * Material Sourcing: Willow materials were harvested from Tilden Park’s Lone Oak trailhead, while dogwoods were collected near Jewel Lake and within the Botanic Garden.
  * Structural Support: Large rocks, gravel, and soil-filled felt bags were integrated to fill eroded gaps, providing a medium for roots to penetrate and further anchor the area.
  * Post-Construction: The site received regular watering until the onset of winter rains and is now undergoing active monitoring to evaluate the success of these bio-engineering techniques.

**Future Management and Environmental Changes** Previous to this project, this part of Wildcat Creek was especially dark due to the large clumps of bay trees (_Umbellularia californica)_. Many of the trees were failing due to heart-rot and other age-related maladies. Due to structural failures—including two separate instances in 2025 where falling trunks damaged a bridge and forced trail closures—additional bay tree removal is scheduled for 2026. These removals will significantly increase light levels, creating ideal growing conditions for the newly planted dogwoods and willows. All new plantings have been officially recorded in the Botanic Garden’s accession system.

#### **Watching Our Watershed: Community Science on Wildcat Creek**

 _By Ethan Rayner_ Wildcat Creek changes constantly. In winter, it swells with stormwater pouring down from the hills. By late summer, certain stretches shrink to shallow pools or dry up entirely, exposing the creek bed. These seasonal shifts are natural, but understanding how and when they happen is essential to protecting our creek’s health. That is why [The Watershed Project (TWP) is launching a new Wildcat Creek Water Level Monitoring (WLM) program](https://thewatershedproject.org/water-level-monitoring/) rooted in community science, art, and public participation.Using simple phone-based monitoring stations installed at pedestrian bridges and other highly visible locations along the creek, community members are encouraged to take photos and upload them to our online database. Over time, these images help track water levels across seasons, building a clearer picture of how Wildcat Creek responds to rainfall, drought, and land use. Each station includes a small phone holder and interpretive sign with step-by-step instructions. Participants simply place their phone in the holder, take a photo, and upload it through TWP’s webpage. Submitted images will be curated and shared with the community to highlight seasonal and long-term changes.

Each water level monitoring sign also features original artwork by local East Bay artists, adding a creative layer to the program. The artwork reflects the character of each site, making every station unique and giving visitors a reason to seek them out along the creek. It’s a fun and engaging way to experience Wildcat Creek while noticing how water moves through the landscape. More details, including a deeper look at each artist and their work, will be shared as part of the program’s full launch later in 2026.

**Why Water Levels Matter** During heavy rains, Wildcat Creek can rise quickly, carrying powerful flows that erode banks, move sediment, and test the resilience of surrounding vegetation. In contrast, dry-season flows reveal exposed beds and shallow pools, demonstrating how aquatic habitat shrinks and shifts during drought. By consistently documenting these changes at specific locations, the monitoring stations help tell a clear story about the erosive power of water and the importance of thoughtful creek management, especially during years marked by drought and intense atmospheric rivers.By pairing visual water level observations with TWP’s existing water-quality monitoring efforts, the program helps connect what we see in the creek to broader watershed conditions. Together, this data supports restoration planning and long-term stewardship by building a shared record of change on both visual and scientific scales.**Monitoring Across the Watershed** TWP is installing water-level monitoring stations at nine locations spanning the length of Wildcat Creek, from the floodplain in North Richmond and San Pablo, through Wildcat Canyon, and into Tilden Regional Park, ending at the Regional Parks Botanic Garden.At the Botanic Garden, TWP worked with staff to identify a monitoring site in the lower Garden that captures both creek levels and a newly installed restoration project. This erosion bioremediation area uses living plants, including alder and red twigged dogwood, to stabilize creek banks and slow down water during high flows. Over time, these deep-rooted native plants help hold soil in place, reduce erosion, and create healthier riparian habitat. Our WLM station onsite will help measure and document the success of this bioremediation as the restored area grows over time.

The program officially launches in**** late winter of 2026, but TWP has already installed six monitoring signs on East Bay Regional Park District property ahead of the rainy season. This early installation is our “soft launch” of the program, allowing community participation to help test how data is collected, shared, and analyzed before full rollout. Subscribe to [The Watershed Project’s newsletter](https://thewatershedproject.org/ebb-and-flow/#subscribe) to stay updated.If you come across one of these signs, take a moment to snap a photo and upload it through TWP’s webpage. Every image contributes to our understanding of how Wildcat Creek functions. Join us as we explore our watershed together!

#### **January Plant Sales**

 _By Rosalie Gonzales_ At this time of year many plants are not looking their best. Below are three different plants featured this month. They are looking particularly nice right now. Plant sales are held Wednesdays, 10:00 a.m.- 12:00 noon, and the first Saturday of every month, 10:00 a.m. - 2:00 p.m._****_[**Here is the current inventory**](https://nativeplants.org/visit/plant-sales?ss_source=sscampaigns&ss_campaign_id=68686d5b1cd0287c9006d003&ss_email_id=695710ae82274d17edef0f09&ss_campaign_name=The+Botanic+Garden+Newsletter+January+2026&ss_campaign_sent_date=2026-01-02T00%3A26%3A28Z)**.**_**Delphinium nudicaule**_ _D. nudicaule_ is known as Red larkspur or Orange Larkspur. Because our plants are hybrids, we can’t be sure of the color of the blossoms. They might or might not be red or orange. _D. nudicaule_ is known to hybridize easily.

It can serve as a ground cover with attractive foliage and small, pink/white flowers that rise about 12 inches or more above the leaves. It needs full sun to part shade in coastal gardens, and probably would do best in full shade inland. It grows naturally only on the Channel Islands off the coast of Southern California, but adapts well in cultivation.Photo: _Heuchera maxima_ by Sandy Steinman.
