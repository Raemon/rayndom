Diana Wahl, former RPBG Interpretive Student Aide and current full-time botanist with Nomad Ecology in Martinez, will be speaking on The Flora of Crystal Springs Watershed, San Mateo Co.

While Diana was a part-time ISA at the Botanic Garden, she also worked as part-time as an intern with the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission/San Francisco Water Power Sewer mostly at Crystal Springs Watershed. During her internship, she made valuable collections for the Botanic Garden and was able to see and closely observe this fascinating land that is closed to the public.
