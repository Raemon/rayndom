**Western Pine Elfin (_Callophrys eryphon_)** is a small butterfly, with a wingspan of 1 to 1.375 inches. An early-season butterfly, it is typically seen in our local area from the last week of March through the first week of May. Numbers peak in April. Its 6-week flight season is the shortest of all the butterflies we see in the Garden. Host plants are mostly hard pines, including Lodgepole Pine (_Pinus contorta_), Limber Pine (_P. flexilis_), and Ponderosa Pine (_P. ponderosa_). All three of these species can be found in the Garden. Caterpillars eat the young needles.

Not a very common sighting in our local area, this butterfly is never seen with open wings. It was added to the Garden’s species list only in April 2025. Males are territorial, and are typically seen perched on shrubs and small trees, looking for females.

It is found primarily in the western half of North America, in the U.S. as well as Canada. However, there are scattered sightings in the eastern half too, mostly in southern Canada (especially near the Great Lakes).
