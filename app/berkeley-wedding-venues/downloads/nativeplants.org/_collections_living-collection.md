The total number of living [accessions](/collections/accessions) currently growing in the ground at the Regional Parks Botanic Garden from known wild sources is **4,012**. An additional **700+** accessions from the wild are growing in containers or are held in both long-term and short-term seed banks. The number of living accessions in our Botanic Garden changes frequently as we constantly add new collections and as plants naturally age and eventually die.

The bulk of the living collection at the Regional Parks Botanic Garden is presented geographically. 

The breakdown of the collection is as follows:
