#### **Four Butterfly Walks in August**

Join Sarab Seth, the Butterfly Guy, for guided butterfly walks in the Botanic Garden. Weekend walks will take place on Saturday, August 23 at 1:00 p.m. and 2:15 p.m. For August, we’re also adding Wednesday walks, on August 20 at 1:00 p.m. and 2:15 p.m.Walks are free, but reservations are required. Each walk is limited to 10 participants, and we meet at the Visitor Center. [Sign up HERE](https://www.signupgenius.com/go/30E0549AFA72CABFE3-57205934-butterfly#/)!**From Sarab’s Notebook:** The coldest summer in 60 years continues to affect butterfly emergence as well as the number of species and individuals we see on the butterfly walks. But August is one of the peak months for butterflies in the Garden. With somewhat decent weather on walk days, we should still see anywhere between six and 10 species.Likely sightings in August include common checkered-skipper (_Pyrgus communis_), field crescent (_Phyciodes pulchella_), cabbage white (_Pieris rapae_), umber skipper (_Lon melane_), and western tiger swallowtail (_Papilio rutulus_).At this time of year, western tiger swallowtails come to nectar on (and pollinate) the big stand of leopard lilies (_Lilium pardalinum_) on the southern edge of the pond lawn. If you’re lucky, you might see a butterfly with wings and abdomen liberally dusted with orange pollen.**Where to Look (If You Can’t Join the Walks)** The best spots now are:

  * The Santa Susana tarplant (_Deinandra minthornii_) near the entrance. 
  * The area around the large circular bed in the Channel Island section.

Also check out all the California pipevine swallowtail chrysalises (_Battus philenor hirsuta_) near the roofline of the shed on the upper path, just before the Channel Island section. Standing on the path, you can see three brown chrysalises and a green one (along with empty chrysalis shells). On the adjacent side, there are five more brown ones.Tip: Binoculars help a lot, especially close-focus ones. The happiest walkers are usually the ones who bring them!Want a preview?
