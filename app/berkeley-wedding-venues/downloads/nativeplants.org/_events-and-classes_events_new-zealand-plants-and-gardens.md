Bart O’Brien will talk about New Zealand plants and gardens he encountered on a recent trip down under.

Bart O’Brien is the current director of the Regional Park Botanic Garden. Before that, he served as the director of special projects for Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden. While in Southern California, Bart also developed an interest in the botany of Baja California. Among his many accomplishments, he is credited with compiling a list of more than 7,000 California native cultivars, helping to save the Edgewood Park serpentine grasslands, and co-authoring multiple books, including [_Care and Maintenance of Southern California Gardens_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11827731-care-maintenance-of-southern-california-native-plant-gardens-cuidado) _._
