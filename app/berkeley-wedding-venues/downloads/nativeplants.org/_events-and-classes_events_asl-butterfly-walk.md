Inviting the sign language community to join Sarab Seth, the butterfly guy, for a free guided walk around the Botanic Garden in search of butterflies. Our checklist of butterflies recorded in the Garden currently stands at 41 species. What butterflies we see on our walks, and how many, changes over the season. At this time of year, it’s normal to see 6 or 8 species during a one-hour walk. Groups with especially good karma might see up to 10 species, if there’s good butterfly weather (sunny, warmer than 65 degrees, and not too windy). It is sometimes hard to get a good look with the naked eye. Please bring binoculars if you have them (close-focus binoculars work best). The happiest people at the end of the walk are usually the ones with binoculars.
