## California Native Peoples and Plants Tour Request Form

The Regional Parks Botanic Garden offers a California Native Peoples and Plants tour to complement the California Indian unit for 4th graders. For schools in Oakland and West Contra Costa county school districts in which at least**** 50 percent of the student population qualifies for the Federal School Lunch Program, bus transportation from the school to the Garden and back to the school is arranged and paid for by the Friends of the Regional Parks Botanic Garden. 

Please fill out this form to request a tour and bus transportation. Tours are available on **Thursdays**. We require requests to be submitted 2 months in advance of your requested tour date, but we recommend submitting your request sooner, since funds are limited.
