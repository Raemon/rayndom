#### **Regional Parks Botanic Garden Celebrates 85 Years!**

Members of the Friends of the Regional Parks Botanic Garden gathered in the Garden after-hours on Saturday, August 23, to celebrate the Garden’s 85th anniversary. The Desert Heat Dancers and the Berkeley Morris Dancers added to the festivities. All enjoyed delicious food, a sing-along, and great company. Chair of the Friends Leadership Council David Sherertz gave welcoming remarks and acknowledged each of the leaders of the 30 years of the _Friends_ organization. Garden Director Bart O’Brien gave a detailed, decade-by-decade history of the Garden and extended thanks to the Garden staff and numerous volunteers who keep the Garden and its activities running so beautifully and smoothly.

#### **Erosion Repair Along Wildcat Creek in the Garden’s Canyon Section**

Erosion by the bridge at the north end of the Canyon section is scheduled for repair starting at the end of August. The work will take four to six weeks, extending through September and into October. This will be a large-scale environmental engineering project with logs, rocks, plantings, and wrapped soil to stabilize the slope. The creek will be temporarily rerouted through pipes, and trout in the work area will be relocated to further down Wildcat Creek. The large machinery involved will have access from Anza View Road, and the entire Canyon section and the recently opened new rainforest trail will be closed during the construction. A Park District biologist will be on-site at all times during construction.

---  
  
The sale will feature a wide array of California native plants propagated and grownfrom the Regional Parks Botanic Garden collection. An early peek at some of the plants that will be available:

  * Many ferns, including quite a few particularly good looking young coastal woodferns (_Dryopteris arguta_).
  * Desert willow (_Chilopsis linearis_): many unusual cultivars, including ‘Warren Jones’, ‘Dark Storm’, ‘Bubba’, and others. These are great large shrubs or small multi-trunked trees for hot inland parts of our region. 
  * Red columbine (_Aquilegia formosa_) grown from seeds, and in gallon pots. A member of the buttercup family, its red and yellow flowers attract hummingbirds, and its seeds feed other bird species. In the garden, it needs regular water, partial shade, and well-draining soil. It will self-seed.
  * Cobb Mountain lupine (_Lupinus sericatus_) grown from seeds, and in three-inch pots. An unusual mounding lupin with big, silvery, palmate leaves and spikes of beautiful pink-to-purple flowers. It’s named for Cobb Mountain, the tallest mountain in the Mayacamas Mountains in Lake County.
  * Liveforevers (_Dudleyas):_ several species in two-inch pots, and grown from seeds _: D. cymosa, D. formosa, D. albiflora D. pulveruenta, D. pachyphytum, D. gnoma, D. virens ssp. hassei._
  * _Crassulaceae_ : these plants, in the stonecrop family, form rosettes with flowers rising on stalks above the succulent leaves.
  * Monkey Flower (_Diplacus_): several cultivars will be offered. Monkeyflowers are small shrubs with colorful tubular flowers that range across the color spectrum.

The full list of plants for sale will be posted on the [Garden website](https://nativeplants.org?ss_source=sscampaigns&ss_campaign_id=68afa5103cd2b569a77af2af&ss_email_id=68b8aff3b83414015dcb5353&ss_campaign_name=Botanic+Garden+Newsletter+September+2025&ss_campaign_sent_date=2025-09-03T21%3A15%3A36Z) during the week before the sale.

#### **September Butterfly Walks**

Join Sarab Seth, the Butterfly Guy, for guided butterfly walks in the Botanic Garden. The September walks will take place on Sunday, September 28, at 1:00 p.m. and 2:15 p.m.Walks are free, but reservations are required. Each walk is limited to 10 participants, and we meet near the main entrance. [Sign up for these walks HERE.](https://www.signupgenius.com/go/30E0549AFA72CABFE3-58355470-butterfly#/)From Sarab’s Notebook:The first half of August was really dismal for butterflies, but after an extended spell of consistently warm weather, the butterfly season seems to be back on track. With decent weather on walk days, we should see between six and eight species on the September walks. Likely sightings include cabbage white (_Pieris rapae_), fiery skipper (_Hylephila phyleus_), mylitta crescent (_Phyciodes mylitta_), mournful duskywing (_Erynnis tristis_), and field crescent (_Phyciodes pulchella_).Where to look (if you can’t join the walks): The best spots right now are still:• The Santa Susana tarplant (_Deinandra minthornii_) near the entrance• The area around the large circular bed in the Channel Island section But in the next few weeks, more and more asters will come into bloom along the creek near the Sea Bluff end of the long bridge, and that will become an excellent spot, too.Also, check out all the California pipevine swallowtail chrysalises (_Battus philenor hirsuta_) near the roofline of the shed on the upper path, just before the Channel Island section. Standing on the path, you can see three brown chrysalises and a green one (along with empty chrysalis shells). On the adjacent side, there are five more brown ones. Looks like they will be here all winter, and hatch only in the spring.Tip: Binoculars help a lot, especially close-focus ones. The happiest walkers are usually the ones who bring them! Want a preview? [See the butterfly pages on the Garden website](https://nativeplants.org/butterfly-id?ss_source=sscampaigns&ss_campaign_id=68afa5103cd2b569a77af2af&ss_email_id=68b8aff3b83414015dcb5353&ss_campaign_name=Botanic+Garden+Newsletter+September+2025&ss_campaign_sent_date=2025-09-03T21%3A15%3A36Z). 

#### **NEW: Two ASL Butterfly Walks Saturday, September 27**

Sarab Seth will lead two butterfly walks on Saturday, September 27, **specifically for the American Sign Language (ASL) community**. There are two one-hour walks scheduled: 1:00 p.m. and 2:00 p.m. Each walk is limited to 10 participants, and we meet near the main entrance. Registration is required.Space is **VERY** limited due to the small size of many of the butterflies and Garden paths. Each person needs to sign up for a separate slot. Please show up promptly and on time. If your plans change, please cancel your reservation (at least 24 hours in advance). [ Register for the ASL walks HERE](https://www.signupgenius.com/go/30E0549AFA72CABFE3-57205934-butterfly#/).
