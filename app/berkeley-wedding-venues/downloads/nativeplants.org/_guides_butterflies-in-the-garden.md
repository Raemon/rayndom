## Butterflies in the Garden

### Butterfly Walks

Free guided butterfly walks are conducted in the Garden by Sarab Seth, the Butterfly Guy, every month from April through October. Walks are normally held in the middle of the month, typically alternating monthly between Saturday and Sunday, at 1 pm and 2:15 pm. In June, July, and August, there will be an additional pair of Wednesday walks. Walks are limited to 10 people each, and require signing up in advance. Sign-ups open on the 1st of the month, unless it is a weekend or a holiday.

Please bring binoculars if you have them (close-focus binoculars work best). The happiest people at the end of the walks are usually the ones with binoculars.

### Gardening for Butterflies

  * [EBRPD Butterfly Gardening Brochure](https://www.ebparks.org/sites/default/files/butterfly-gardening-brochure.pdf)

  * [Native Plants that Attract Butterflies](/s/Butterfly-listdocx.pdf) \- A detailed list of California native plants that attract butterflies. It was compiled by the late Es Anderson, a dedicated Botanic Garden volunteer who managed the annual plant sale for many years. The list was further divided into those plants that attract nectar-feeding adult butterflies and those that provide food for butterfly larvae by Judy Lundy, a lepidopterist and naturalist devoted to sharing her love of nature with school children. Entries were expanded and updated by Art Shapiro, professor of Evolution and Ecology at the University of California, Davis. Butterflies on the Garden's checklist appear in bold.




### Botanic Garden Butterfly Checklist

Compiling a checklist of butterflies seen in the Botanic Garden will always be an ongoing process. The current list of 41 butterfly species (and a moth) is based on sightings reported on iNaturalist, and supplemented by personal observations. 41 species is already a very respectable number for a small location like the Garden. Four species were added in 2024, and one in April 2025. Hopefully, there will be a few more additions over time.

Of the Garden’s 41 species, only 1 is non-native. Cabbage White is believed to have originated in the eastern Mediterranean region, and arrived in the U.S. in the 1860s. It was first reported in North America in 1860 (in Quebec, Canada). There is only one other local butterfly I know of that is not native to California: Gulf Fritillary was introduced into southern California in the 19th century, from Florida and Texas, where it is common. It seems to have become established in the Bay Area only in the 1950s. However, Gulf Fritillary has no native host plant, and it has not been recorded in the Garden.

To help identify butterflies you may have seen in the Garden, the [Butterfly ID](/butterfly-id)**** page shows all 41 species at a glance.

Clicking a link in the sightings table will take you to a page with a short description of that butterfly and photographs. Unless otherwise mentioned, all photographs are by Sarab Seth. For photographs marked with an asterisk (*) there is additional text that you can display by clicking on the photograph (or hovering over it).

### New in This Section

  * A set of 7 high-magnification photographs of butterfly eggs by Brent Haglund. Please look for them on the following pages: [American Lady](https://nativeplants.org/american-lady), [Cabbage White](https://nativeplants.org/cabbage-white), [California Pipevine Swallowtail](https://nativeplants.org/california-pipevine-swallowtail)*, [Monarch](https://nativeplants.org/monarch)*, [Painted Lady](https://nativeplants.org/painted-lady), [Red Admiral](https://nativeplants.org/red-admiral), [Variable Checkerspot](https://nativeplants.org/variable-checkerspot)*. For the three butterflies marked with an asterisk, you can compare the high-magnification photograph of the egg(s) to a “normal”-magnification photograph.

  * A video by local bee and insect enthusiast, May Chen, which shows an [Acmon Blue](https://nativeplants.org/acmon-blue) attempting to mate with a [Gray Hairstreak](https://nativeplants.org/gray-hairstreak) (an attempt doomed to failure). Such inter-species mating attempts are quite rare. To capture such an attempt, and in such a sharp video, is really amazing!




We have been hard at work on a butterfly brochure for the Garden. If all goes well, the brochure should be completed over the winter.

During the butterfly season -- roughly April through October -- we will try to maintain an updated list of butterflies seen in the Garden during the last 15 days.

For any comments on these butterfly pages (or corrections, suggestions, questions), please email [bgarden@ebparks.org](mailto:bgarden@ebparks.org?). 

### Sightings Table

#### Note:

  * Second column numbers are based on only one visit, in less-than-ideal weather.

  * The second half of October was unusually good this year. Both visits during this period were made in perfect weather.

  * Now that the butterfly walk season is over, I will not update the sightings table until the spring. If there is something significant seen in the Garden during this time, I will add a comment here, in bold type.
