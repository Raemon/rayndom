## Group Tour Request Form

For college students, adult groups, non-profits, and private corporations, our trained docents lead tours through the Garden. You must request a tour at least 4 weeks ahead of time. You can either choose one of our theme tours or tell us what you want.

The maximum group size is 30 participants, with a ratio of 1 docent to every 10 participants. Depending on the subject matter that will be covered during the tour, the group may be divided into groups of 5 per docent.

You will hear back from the Garden Office concerning your tour request within 5 business days.
