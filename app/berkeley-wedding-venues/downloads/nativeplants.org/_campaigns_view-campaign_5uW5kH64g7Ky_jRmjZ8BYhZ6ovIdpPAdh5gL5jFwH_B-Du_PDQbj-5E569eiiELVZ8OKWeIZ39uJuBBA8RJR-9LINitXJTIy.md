### Refugio Manzanita

By Sandy SteinmanNow is a great time to see my favorite manzanita, Refugio manzanita __(_Arctostaphylos refugioensis_). It is currently in full bloom in the Santa Lucia section of the Garden.Refugio manzanita usually has the white, urn-shaped flowers and red fruits typical of all manzanitas and striking red-purple bark. However Bart O’Brien, Garden Director, notes that the flower color of the plant in the Botanic Garden can vary from year to year and in many years has displayed a deep pink color.This species can grow 7-13 feet tall and 7 feet wide, and thrives on sandstone soils, as is characteristic of chapparal plants. It is endemic to Santa Barbara County, where it is found along the coast, particularly around Refugio State Beach and into the Santa Ynez Mountains. Manzanitas are members of the Ericaceae, or heather, family. This particular species is listed as a species of special concern by the California Native Plant Society, meaning it is at risk of becoming an endangered plant. Threats include habitat loss, fragmentation, and climate change.As an important part of the California ecosystem, the Refugio manzanita provides food and shelter for a variety of wildlife, including birds, mammals, and insects, and is an important food source for the endangered California gnatcatcher. It is also used in landscaping and for erosion control. One of the showier manzanitas, it can be an excellent garden plant. It is drought-tolerant and deer-resistant and can handle temperatures down to at least 8° Fahrenheit. It can tolerate clay and is a fast grower. It thrives in our mild climate area, but can also do well in cultivation in hotter and colder inland areas.Sources for this article include [Calscape](https://calscape.org/Arctostaphylos-refugioensis-%28Refugio-Manzanita%29), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctostaphylos_refugioensis), [CNPS](https://rareplants.cnps.org/Plants/Details/?taxon=Arctostaphylos%20refugioensis), and [Las Pilitas Nursery](https://www.laspilitas.com/nature-of-california/plants/76--arctostaphylos-refugioensis-refugio).

There is a lot more to know! This issue of _Manzanita_ will dive into some of the fascinating stories that swirl about these intriguing plants.All _Friends_ of the Regional Parks Botanic Garden receive _Manzanita_ issues as a benefit of membership.

### Plant Sales

**Island alumroot (**_**Heuchera maxima**_**) is the featured species this month.** A Channel Island native, Island Alumroot can thrive in dry shade and under oaks, but this adaptable plant can also do well in part or full sun on the coast. It requires little water once established. Inland gardeners will need to protect it from full sun and provide additional water. It spreads by rhizomes and forms 1 to 2-foot-tall mats. White to pink flowers grow in clusters on foot- long stems that rise above the 2 to 3-inch hairy, green leaves. This plant is larger overall than others in this genus. The propagators have many examples for sale in sizes ranging from 3-inch to 1-gallon pots.Plant sales are held Wednesdays,10:00 a.m. to12:00 noon, and the first Saturday of every month, 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. Enter at the Garden’s West Gate, along Anza View Road. [Current plant inventory is available on the Garden website](https://nativeplants.org/activitycollection/plant-sales).
