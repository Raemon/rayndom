#### **Share Your Vision for the Botanic Garden**

The East Bay Regional Park District wants your ideas! The Park District is conducting a public survey in preparation for developing a new overall plan. We know you care about the Botanic Garden. **Let the District know what a special place this is and how you would like to see it grow into an even more valuable resource for all of us. Survey question #4 directly applies to Botanic Garden interests.** Here are some ideas people are talking about:• **A New and Larger Visitor Center** : A welcoming space with modern exhibits illustrating all you can learn from this world-class, native-plant Botanic Garden, as well as room for more classrooms to serve the public and other space to support the work of the Botanic Garden, including research.• **Improved Access and Parking** : A larger parking area, restrooms, and a beautiful new entrance to the Botanic Garden along Anza View Road to avoid the dangers of crossing Wildcat Canyon Road.• **Expanded Staff and Facilities** : To properly care for the Park District’s 85-year investment in this unique and growing collection of plants and knowledge, the Garden needs more staff. New, modern offices and other workspaces will enable the Garden to further its leadership during this critical time of climate change.• **Demonstration Gardens** : Horticulturally-based plantings around a new Visitor Center will demonstrate some of the many California native plants that will thrive in your own gardens or local parks. Accompanying interpretation will illustrate how native plants support a sustainable future, local pollinators, and other wildlife while requiring little water and no chemical fertilizers or toxic pest control. • **Native Plant Nursery** : A large Botanic Garden native plant nursery that would supply plants for the parks throughout the District as well as for expanded public sales. • **Diverse Learning Programs** : Funding to support a rich program of multi-language and multi-cultural learning that would attract even more of the diverse population of the Bay Area than already visits and enjoys this unique setting.• **Better Transportation** : Improved public and/or Park District-funded transportation to the Botanic Garden and other Tilden attractions to make them more accessible to a broader audience.• **Your Ideas!** What would you add to this list?**Make Your Voice Heard : How do you envision the future of the Botanic Garden? Fill out the EBRPD survey and share your ideas! **[**Click here to take the EBRPD Survey**](https://www.ebparks.org/district-plan)**.****Please do so before the July 31, 2025 deadline.**

During these years, the Garden has served as a sanctuary for many of the state's rare and endangered plants, a research laboratory for studying the effects of climate change, a seed bank and source of propagated native plants, a classroom for children, and a tranquil place for visitors to wander surrounded by nature’s beauty. |

#### **Join Us for Two Butterfly Walks: Saturday, June 21**

Join Sarab Seth, the Butterfly Guy, for a guided walk around the Botanic Garden in search of butterflies. Two walks are scheduled for Saturday, June 21, at 1:00 p.m. and at 2:15 p.m. Meet at the Botanic Garden Visitor Center. **These walks are free, but reservations are required. Each walk is limited to 10 participants.**[**Registration link will be posted on the Garden web page**](https://nativeplants.org?ss_source=sscampaigns&ss_campaign_id=683a3b4d60e51d1c7ca5d980&ss_email_id=684074a609dcb766b5de3b08&ss_campaign_name=Botanic+Garden+Newsletter+June+2025&ss_campaign_sent_date=2025-06-04T16%3A30%3A57Z)**.** Sarab’s butterfly observations:Last year there was a nice little explosion in the number of species from the end of May through June. From seeing roughly 10 species in a one-hour visit in the first three weeks of May, we increased our numbers to almost 20 in the first three weeks of June. This year, the explosion seems to be late. The most likely reason is that throughout the season we have not had more than two consecutive days of good butterfly weather (sunny, temperature at least 65 degrees, and not too windy). One or two days of such weather has alternated with longer stretches of sub-optimal weather. This pattern affects butterfly emergence, resulting in fewer butterflies flying on warm days. If days are warmer in June, the number of species should increase for our walks.California Pipevine Swallowtail (_Battus philenor hirsuta_) was the star of the show last month. Adults will largely have stopped flying by the time of our June walks, but caterpillars and (possibly) eggs should still be seen. There should be decent sightings of Acmon Blue (_Icaricia acmon_), Variable Checkerspot (_Euphydryas chalcedona_), and possibly Lorquin's Admiral (_Limenitis lorquini_). Umber Skippers (_Lon melane_) have been more numerous in our local area this May than they were last year. Their courtship is usually seen in September/October, when their numbers reach a second peak, but there is a chance there will be courting pairs on the June walks. We should also see both Field Crescent (_Phyciodes pulchella_) and Mylitta Crescent (_Phyciodes mylitta_).[All these butterflies can be checked out on the Garden website](https://nativeplants.org/guides/butterflies-in-the-garden?ss_source=sscampaigns&ss_campaign_id=683a3b4d60e51d1c7ca5d980&ss_email_id=684074a609dcb766b5de3b08&ss_campaign_name=Botanic+Garden+Newsletter+June+2025&ss_campaign_sent_date=2025-06-04T16%3A30%3A57Z). For those who cannot make the walks this month, the best Garden location for sighting butterflies should be the large, circular bed in the Channel Island section. Whether you join the walks or come to look for butterflies on your own, it’s helpful to have binoculars; close-focus binoculars work best. The happiest people at the end of the walk are usually the ones with binoculars._Sarab Seth is a butterfly photographer and docent at the Botanic Garden. He is helping to finalize a new brochure highlighting butterflies found in the Botanic Garden. Sarab's monthly Garden butterfly walks will continue through October._

#### **Garden Greeter Gatherings**

Greeters and docents gathered on a sunny May day in a home garden full of native plants. We were there for a volunteer work party assembling magnifying glasses. These are one of our most popular prizes for children who play our ISpy and Treasure Hunt games during their visit to the Botanic Garden on weekends and holidays.

![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/666115df3fa3b24521c127ed/92ae4f50-8e79-4322-8686-0d222714ffe1/greeters+small+2.jpg?content-type=image%2Fjpeg&format=750w)  
  
The attendees had an afternoon of fun, food, lively conversation and productivity. Lanyards and Botanic Garden labels were attached to 300 magnifying glasses. This was the first of a series of potluck work parties in support of the Greeter Table.
