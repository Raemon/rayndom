Richard Schwartz will guide us through Native American lore surrounding the California Poppy, changes brought by Spanish settlers and their livestock in the late 18th century, the flower's survival challenges during the Gold Rush and American land development, and its deep cultural impact in California. We'll also hear about a self-taught woman botanist from the late 19th century who championed the poppy to become California's state flower in 1903. Visit Richard Schwartz's [website](https://www.richardschwartz.info/) for more details
