#### **Four Butterfly Walks in July**

Join Sarab Seth, the Butterfly Guy, for guided butterfly walks in the Botanic Garden. Weekend walks will take place Sunday, July 20, at 1:00 p.m. and 2:15 p.m. And, just for July and August, we’re adding Wednesday walks too—this month on July 23, at 1:00 p.m. and 2:15 p.m. Walks are **free,** but reservations are required. Each walk is limited to 10 participants, and we meet at the Visitor Center. [**Sign up HERE**](https://www.signupgenius.com/go/30E0549AFA72CABFE3-57205934-butterfly#/)**!****From Sarab’s Notebook:** The weather continues to flip between sunny and chilly, which affects butterfly emergence. We’re seeing fewer species and individuals on cooler days—but June through August remains peak butterfly season. Currently, the most abundant butterfly in the Garden is the Mylitta crescent (_Phyciodes mylitta_). Regular sightings include the California sister (_Adelpha californica_), cabbage white (_Pieris rapae_), Lorquin’s admiral (_Limenitis lorquini_), umber skipper (_Lon melane_), western tiger swallowtail (_Papilio rutulus_), and Acmon blue (_Icaricia acmon_), which has recently reappeared. Field crescent (_Phyciodes pulchella_) numbers are low but should rise soon.**Where to Look (Even If You Can’t Join the Walks):** The best spots now are:

  * Around the large circular bed in the Channel Island section.
  * A new spot**:** Walk past the greenhouse, cross the small bridge, and go down the steps just before the NOTICE sign. Near the bottom, check the area on the left. The California sister has been a reliable sighting.

Tip: **Binoculars help a lot** , especially close-focus ones. The happiest walkers are usually the ones who bring them!Want a preview?

Hours: 10:00 a.m.–2:00 p.m. Full inventory of the species for sale is available on the [Garden website](https://nativeplants.org?ss_source=sscampaigns&ss_campaign_id=6865825b19478102efd1f3b2&ss_email_id=68659e7cac52ae609cde5631&ss_campaign_name=Botanic+Garden+Newsletter+July+2025&ss_campaign_sent_date=2025-07-02T21%3A03%3A15Z).

It’s a great food source for many butterflies and bees. Watershed Nursery calls it a “pollinator powerhouse.” It forms rosettes of crinkled gray leaves. Stout stems with lavender flowers rise up to a foot above. Plant in full sun. It’s deer resistant and drought tolerant.  
---  
|  |  Climbing penstemon (Keckiella cordifolia) is a perennial plant native to Southern California and the Channel Islands. It can spread to six feet tall and wide and gets its name from its ability to crawl or spill over rocks, fences, and other plants. Its stunning tubular red flowers attract hummingbirds and butterflies. It can grow in full sun in cooler coastal areas, and on shady slopes in the hotter inland areas. While deciduous with winter cold or summer drought, it can be evergreen with summer water, especially in milder climates. It is somewhat deer resistant.Photos by John Rusk.
