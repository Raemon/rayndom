### Help the Friends

The Friends of the Regional Parks Botanic Garden help publicize and raise funds for the Garden through many different activities. No experience is needed to assist the Friends, just a love of the Garden and a desire to help. For more information about volunteer opportunities with the Friends, inquire at [info@nativeplants.org](mailto:info@nativeplants.org).

### Friends Leadership Council

The Friends Leadership Council (FLC) steers the activities of the Friends. FLC meetings are usually held in the Garden's Visitor Center auditorium on the third Thursday of most months 1:00-3:00 PM. Call (510) 544-3169 to verify the meeting time and place. Friends members are welcome to attend as non-voting observers, can offer comments and suggestions, and can join committees that contribute to FLC activities.
