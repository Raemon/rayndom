The Regional Parks Botanic Garden is home to many native bats! Their sensitivity to habitat and climate disturbance makes them useful indicators of ecosystem health. Dr. Chelsea Andreozzi spent 407 summer nights monitoring bats using ultrasonic detection equipment across a spectrum of forest management types and microclimates. Her studies combining in-depth fieldwork with geographic data provides insight into what bats need to survive.

Join Dr. Andreozzi for an evening twilight bat walk here in the Garden! The evening will consist of a brief classroom portion followed by a walk through the Garden with bat monitors. Please meet inside the Visitor Center Auditorium at 6:45pm. [Sign up](https://www.signupgenius.com/go/30E0549AFA72CABFE3-57924376-twilight#/) for the walk.

The Visitor Center is just inside the main gate of the Regional Parks Botanic Garden located at the corner of Wildcat Canyon Road and South Park Drive. **PLEASE NOTE:** for navigating the Garden after dark, you may want to bring a flashlight!
