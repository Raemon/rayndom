**Northern White-Skipper (_Heliopetes ericetorum_)** is a small butterfly, with a wingspan of 1.25 to 1.5 inches. This butterfly is a relatively rare sighting in East Bay. Local sightings are scattered from May through October, with a slight peak in June. Host plants are Mallows, including Bushmallow (_Malacothamnus_), Globemallow (_Sphaeralcea_), Hollyhock _(Althaea_), and Mallow (_Malva_). In our extended local area, Bushmallow may be the primary host plant. Bushmallow is a fire follower, springing up quickly in the aftermath of a fire. So Northern White-Skipper can be regarded as a fire-follower butterfly in our extended local area.

Males are largely white; females have much more black.  
  
This is an example of a spread-wing skipper. Unlike grass skippers, the forewing and hindwing are laid out side-by-side. Spread-wing skippers are also generally larger than grass skippers and do not share their characteristic brown-and-orange color scheme.

The type specimen, from which this butterfly was identified and named, was collected by Pierre Lorquin (after whom the [Lorquin’s Admiral](/lorquins-admiral) is named).

This butterfly is found primarily in the US, with a few scattered sightings in Baja California.
