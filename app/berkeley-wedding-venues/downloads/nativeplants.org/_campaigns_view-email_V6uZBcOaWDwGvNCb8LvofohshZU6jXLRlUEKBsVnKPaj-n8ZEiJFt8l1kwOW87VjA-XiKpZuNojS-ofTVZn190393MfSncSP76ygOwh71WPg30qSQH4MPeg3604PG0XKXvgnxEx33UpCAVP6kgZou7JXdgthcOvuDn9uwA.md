#### **Spring Plant Sale: Saturday, April 19**

This year’s Spring Plant Sale will offer herbaceous plants and sub-shrubs only. Of special note: seed-grown trillium will be available! _**Friends**_**members’ sale starts at 9:00 a.m., general public sale starts at 10:00 a.m. The sale ends at 2:00 p.m.** _**Friends**_**memberships can be purchased at the Garden on the morning of the sale, starting at 8:30 a.m., or in advance on the**[**Garden website**](https://nativeplants.org/support/become-a-friend?ss_source=sscampaigns&ss_campaign_id=67d9b43911fc6a43266d6bae&ss_email_id=67f04f715161802646744a21&ss_campaign_name=Botanic+Garden+Newsletter+April+2025&ss_campaign_sent_date=2025-04-04T21%3A30%3A53Z)**.** As with all of our biannual plant sales, the full listing of plants, pot sizes, and prices will be posted at least a week before the sale date on the [Garden website](https://nativeplants.org?ss_source=sscampaigns&ss_campaign_id=67d9b43911fc6a43266d6bae&ss_email_id=67f04f715161802646744a21&ss_campaign_name=Botanic+Garden+Newsletter+April+2025&ss_campaign_sent_date=2025-04-04T21%3A30%3A53Z), and will be updated up to and including the Friday evening before the sale. We will have our full plant inventory for sale during the Fall Plant Sale when the weather is appropriate for planting. Garden Director, Bart O’Brien, provided the following notes on some of the special offerings at this year’s spring sale:  _**Adiantum**_**x** _**tracyi**_ – We grew these plants from spores collected from this naturally occurring hybrid, so expect these to be variable! The parentage of this hybrid is _A. aleuticum_ (evergreen) and _A. jordanii_(summer deciduous), and the original hybrid plants tend to be evergreen, but with distinctive seasons of new growth (March–April and October–November). These vigorous young plants may behave just like the parent hybrid or they may tend to be more like one of the parent species–though none of these has gone fully summer dormant for us so far. These plants make excellent container specimens for bright shady areas, and usually require regular watering.  _**Trillium**_ – We have plants grown here from seedlings that have not yet bloomed after five years. Most should have white flowers and are either _T. chloropetalum_ (most likely) or _T. albidum_. It’s possible that there could be other color forms of _T. chloropetalum_ –dark maroon, mauve, or pinkish. These plants are very long-lived perennials when grown in partial shade where the soil **never** gets too hot or dry (key word here is hot–they do not like hot soil). **For butterfly lovers** , we will have two very good caterpillar food plants: an abundance of young California pipevines (_Aristolochia californica_), and a smaller number of _Lomatium californicum_ –probably the showiest of the Lomatiums. **Hardy Creek Barberry**(_Berberis nervosa_ var. _mendocinensis_)**** is one of the notable discoveries of our founding director, James Roof. It is widely recognized as one of the most distinctive forms of _Berberis_ native to North America. That’s because it looks much more like its Asiatic cousins–with much larger leaflets and many more leaflets per leaf–AND because it is tall, slowly growing to six feet or more in height. It produces multiple six-to-eight-inch terminal inflorescences, each containing a multitude of sweet smelling golden yellow flowers. The flowers are followed by attractive, 1/4-inch blue-black berries that certainly look tempting to eat, but their taste is quite disappointing (some would say they are downright bad). Leave these fruits for the birds that relish them. A few more early teasers: _Adelinia_ (_Cynoglossum_) _grandis_ , _Artemisia californica_ ‘Canyon Gray’, _Asarum caudatum_ , _Calamagrostis foliosa_ , _Chlorogalum pomeridianum_ , _Eriogonum giganteum_ , _Eriogonum grande_ var. _rubescens_ , _Erythronium_ _revolutum_ , _Heterotheca sessiliflora_ subsp. _bolanderi_ (from Albany Hill), _Heuchera maxima_ (the largest _Heuchera_ species), _Heuchera parishii_ ‘Chiquita’ (the smallest _Heuchera_ cultivar), _Iris douglasiana_ , _Iris macrosiphon_ , _Iris_ sp., _Lilium_ ‘Tilden Botanic Garden’, _Lilium pardalinum_ subsp. _pardalinum_ (small pots!), _Lilium pardalinum_ subsp. _pitkinense_ (small pots!), _Oxalis oregana_ (pink flowers), (white flowers), and ‘Klamath Ruby’, _Penstemon newberryi_ , _Penstemon rupicola_ , _Phacelia californica_ , _Phyla nodiflora_ , _Polypodium californicum_ , _Salvia_ ‘Gayle Nielson’, _Salvia spathacea_ , and _Wyethia angustifolia_.

#### **Butterfly Walks in the Garden**

Butterfly walks resume this season on Sunday, April 20th, with walks at 1:00 p.m. and 2:15 p.m. Tours will be led by docent Sarab Seth, the “Butterfly Guy,” and will be limited to 10 participants each. Registration is required; see below.Here are Sarab’s observations from April and May last year:

  * Western Brown Elfin (_Callophrys augustinus iroides_) was seen repeatedly in April and May. Manzanita (_Arctostaphylos_) is a host plant, so the butterfly’s presence in the Garden certainly makes sense. This is an early season butterfly, and is rarely seen after May.
  * The Pipeline Swallowtail (_Battus philenor_) is one of our most popular butterflies; the best chance of seeing eggs is on the April/May walks. The adult butterflies should be plentiful in April/May, and caterpillars should be visible in May/June.

This season’s walks will take place on various Saturdays and Sundays, as noted below. Registration is required and will be available on the [Garden website](https://nativeplants.org?ss_source=sscampaigns&ss_campaign_id=67d9b43911fc6a43266d6bae&ss_email_id=67f04f715161802646744a21&ss_campaign_name=Botanic+Garden+Newsletter+April+2025&ss_campaign_sent_date=2025-04-04T21%3A30%3A53Z) before the scheduled dates.

#### **Garden Greeter Volunteers Needed**

It is great fun to welcome our visitors as a Garden Greeter. Most of our visitors are new to the Garden and appreciate a friendly face and a brief introduction.
