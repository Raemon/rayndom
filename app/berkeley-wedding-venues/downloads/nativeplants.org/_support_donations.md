## Donations & Endowment

### Donations

Your donations to the Garden help support many important projects, including collecting native plants, improving plant beds, building pathways, training [docents](/volunteer/become-a-docent), and conserving and enhancing the Garden in many ways.

### Endowment

The Regional Parks Botanic Garden Endowment was established to provide long-term financial security for the Garden during times of budget reductions at state and local levels. Invested over time, any size donation can make a significant difference. Your gift to the Endowment will help secure the future of one of California's most important botanical collections. 

We also welcome bequests to the Regional Parks Botanic Garden Endowment. Including the Endowment as a beneficiary in your will, trust, life insurance policy, or annuity is a wonderful way to contribute to the Garden's future. Planned giving helps you maximize the tax benefits of charitable donation while allowing you to provide a level of giving you might not have thought possible. By including a simple paragraph in your will, you can help ensure permanent protection for the Garden's collections.

For information about gifts and bequests to the Regional Parks Botanic Garden Endowment, visit the [Legacy Giving](https://www.regionalparksfoundation.org/PlannedGiving) page at the Regional Parks Foundation website or contact the Regional Parks Foundation at (510) 544-2202 or [help@regionalparksfoundation.org](mailto:help@regionalparksfoundation.org).
