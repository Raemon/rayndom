Have you ever wondered why weeds are so resilient?**** Deep tap roots, huge numbers of seeds, or tenacious runners can combine with plant chemistry to lead to the rapid proliferation of these "plants in the wrong place". Greti Sequin will explore various features of some weedy plants that contribute to their success, including their chemical make up. 

Greti Sequin has a Ph.D. in organic chemistry and is a plant enthusiast. She taught organic chemistry, natural products chemistry, and chemistry for non-majors at San Francisco State University for more than twenty years, and has also led numerous field seminars on the subject of plant chemistry. She is a docent at the Regional Parks Botanic Garden and the author of the book “The Chemistry of Plants: Perfumes, Pigments, and Poisons”.
