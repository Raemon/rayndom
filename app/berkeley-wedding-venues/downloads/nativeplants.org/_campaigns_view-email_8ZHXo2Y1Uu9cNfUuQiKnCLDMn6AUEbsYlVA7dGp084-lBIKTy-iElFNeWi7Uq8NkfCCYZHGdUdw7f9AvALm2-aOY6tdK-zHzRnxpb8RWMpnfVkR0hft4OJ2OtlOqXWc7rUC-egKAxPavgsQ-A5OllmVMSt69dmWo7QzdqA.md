#### Help Preserve a Local Treasure

The Regional Parks Botanic Garden is a naturally charming and tranquil 10-acre living museum of California native plants. The Garden is always free, is open nearly every day of the year, and is a magical place to enjoy native plants and trees. It is also a center for education, research, conservation, and community engagement. By donating to the Friends of the Regional Parks Botanic Garden you will help us to:

  * Maintain and expand our collection of 4,000+ taxa of native plants from all parts of the California Floristic Province and help to fund collecting field trips by Garden staff.
  * Offer free programs and events for children, families, schools, and adults.
  * Train volunteer docents and Garden greeters.
  * Conduct innovative research on plant biology, horticulture, pathogens, ecology, and evolution.
  * Protect and restore endangered and threatened plant species and habitats.
  * Fund Botanic Garden projects.
  * Propagate and sell native plants (of often rare and endangered species).
  * Inspire and empower people to appreciate and care for the environment.

Trumpet-shaped red flowers attract birds, especially hummingbirds. Under the right conditions it can bloom almost year-round. It can grow in sun or part shade, but will produce more flowers with full sun. The plant is cold sensitive but tolerates occasional light frosts. It is very versatile and can be planted as a ground cover, pruned as a hedge, grown in containers, or trained on a trellis. It will tolerate a variety of soils if well drained.

Stunning tubular red flowers attract hummingbirds and butterflies. It can grow in full sun in cooler coastal areas, and on shady slopes in the hotter inland areas. While deciduous with winter cold or summer drought, it can be evergreen with summer water, especially in milder climates. It is somewhat deer resistant.Photo by John Rusk.
