**Field Crescent _(Phyciodes pulchella)_** is a small-medium butterfly, with a wingspan of 1 to 1.75 inches. It can be seen from April to October. Numbers peak in July. Host plants are various Asters.

This butterfly can be hard to distinguish from the [Northern Checkerspot](/northern-checkerspot) female, especially when the specimen is worn. Both pattern and size are similar.

Butterflies usually mate in a back-to-back position, joined together at the tip of the abdomen (see the Mylitta Crescent photographs for a rare exception). In some species, females mate only once, but for most species, they mate multiple times, albeit with a gap of several days in between. The reason has to do with how the male passes on his sperm. Sperm is not deposited directly. Instead, the male takes some time to form a spermatophore, which occurs inside the female. Some matings last only 20 minutes, others can last a whole day or more! A spermatophore consists of a tough outer envelope, an inner matrix of fluids, and a bolus of sperm. While the exact number varies across species, a male may pass on as much as 13% of his total body weight through the spermatophore during mating. It is large enough to block the female's reproductive tract, so she can't mate again for a few days till she has broken down the outer shell of the spermatophore and fertilized her eggs. Only then is she ready to mate again.

This may explain why, for many species, males are observed much more frequently than females. Males hang around in the open every day, searching for receptive females. For a few days after each mating, a female does not appear except to feed. And the average life of an adult butterfly is 3 weeks. "A few days after each mating" can add up to half its life.

It is found in the western third of the US, and in British Columbia and Alberta, stretching north through Yukon into Alaska.

**Video captions  
** For videos, we cannot embed captions like with photographs. This is the caption for both the mating videos below.

Usually, mating pairs sit virtually motionless. That may be a defense mechanism. Mating pairs can stay joined together for a very long time (anywhere from 20 minutes to a whole day). During this time, they are more vulnerable to predators than normal because they cannot fly with their normal agility.  
  
I watched this pair for 10 minutes. For the first 7 or 8 minutes, they kept slowly flapping their wings (not clear why they would do this). That is shown in the first mating video. And then, during the last 2 or 3 minutes before they separated, they started moving around a whole lot, twisting and turning. That is shown in the second mating video. 

Normally you don't see the male organ when they are joined together, but this pair moved around a lot and their connection became a little loose at one point in the first video. That reddish blob that you see is the butterfly equivalent of a penis (called an aedeagus).

(Once before this, I have seen mating Field Crescents moving a lot. This species may be more prone to this behavior than others.)
