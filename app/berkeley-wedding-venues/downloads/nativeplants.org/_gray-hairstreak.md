**Gray Hairstreak _(Strymon melinus)_** is a small butterfly, with a wingspan of 0.875 to 1.375 inches. In our local area, it can be seen from March to October. Numbers peak in August. There is a large variety of host plants, most often from the Pea (Fabaceae) and Mallow (Malvaceae) families, including Beans (_Phaseolus_), Clovers (_Trifolium_), and Mallows (_Malva_).

The name “Hairstreak” may refer both to the thin tails, which are part of an elaborate defense mechanism, and the thin streaks that mark the underside of the wings. The tails mimic antennae, and the eye spots mimic eyes. When the butterfly rubs its hindwings together to draw attention to this false head (see video), predators are fooled into thinking the tail is the head. The predator strikes there; the butterfly loses only a bit of wing, and flies away (butterflies are able to fly normally even with large chunks of wing missing).

Like [Acmon Blue](/acmon-blue), Gray Hairstreak has a _mutualistic relationship_ with ants (both species benefit). The ants protect the caterpillars from predators in exchange for the sweet “honeydew” the caterpillars secrete from a _nectary gland_. Roughly three-fourths of butterflies in the Lycaenidae family have a relationship with ants, but not always mutualistic.

It is found along the southern edge of Canada, all across the US and Mexico and Central America, into the northern edge of South America.

**Impossible mating attempt* (Video by May Chen)**  
An Acmon Blue is trying to mate with this Gray Hairstreak. Only the same species, or closely related species, can mate successfully. For species that are very different, like these two, mating is physically impossible because the genitals join together through a lock-and-key system.
