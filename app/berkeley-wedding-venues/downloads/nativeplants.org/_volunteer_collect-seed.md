## Collect Seed

![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/666115df3fa3b24521c127ed/d9baf74e-9e64-4245-aa36-4df75f5cc1a8/seedpacks.jpg)

Native plant seed packets

The Seedy Friends volunteer group meets on occasional Tuesdays (more often in summer and fall) to gather seeds when they are ripe, and infrequently in winter to package seeds. We meet at Juniper Lodge (the potting shed near the west gate) at the Garden at 11:30 AM, for an hour or two. In the process, we learn a lot about the plants, the seeds, and propagation, and we always enjoy the walk in the Garden.

Seeds collected by Seedy Friends are available to [purchase](/visit/plant-sales) in the Visitor Center.
