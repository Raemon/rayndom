In 2023 Dana York coauthored two books about the Plants of the Pacific Crest Trail - Northern and Southern California. He’ll talk about his work that led to these books, and some of the plants that you can find in them.

For over 30 years, Dana York has worked on floristic and special-status plant species throughout California and Oregon, discovering new plant species in the Oregon Cascade, Klamath, and Sierra Nevada ranges. He is currently a Botany Research Associate at the Cal Academy of Sciences.
