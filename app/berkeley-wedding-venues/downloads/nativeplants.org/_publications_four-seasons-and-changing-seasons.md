### The Changing Seasons

The founding director of the Botanic Garden, James B. Roof, retired from the East Bay Regional Park District in 1976. His successor at the Botanic Garden, Wayne Roderick, started working for the Park District on August 23, 1976. Roof continued writing and publishing _The Four Season_ through the completion of Volume 5 in August of 1978. 

Roof became increasing embittered toward the Botanic Garden such that in August of 1979 he began self-publishing a new journal, _The Changing Seasons_ , where he continued publishing his research, observations, and conclusions regarding his favorite topic: manzanitas (_Arctostaphylos_ spp.) and a few other topics. Only five separate issues of _The Changing Seasons_ were published before his death in 1983, and these form a single “Volume 1” as the fourth issue is titled “Supplement to Volume 1, Number 3.” This supplemental issue is entirely free of articles on manzanitas and is the only issue of _The Changing Seasons_ with contributions from other authors. It also contains some of Roof’s most compelling writing. These five issues are enumerated here as they are not widely known and are very rarely available.

Only Xerox copies of these issues are available. Contact us at [BGarden@ebparks.org](mailto:BGarden@ebparks.org).
