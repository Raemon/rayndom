## FAQ

### Visiting the Garden

  * ####  What are the Garden's hours? 

From October 1 though May 31, the Garden is open from 8:30 AM to 5:00 PM.

From June 1 through September 30, the Garden is open from 8:30 AM to 5:30 PM.

The Garden is closed only on these three days: Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day, and New Year’s Day.

  * ####  Is there a fee for admission to the Garden? 

No. Admission to the Garden is free.

  * ####  Is there a fee for parking? 

No. Parking at the Garden is free.

  * ####  Can I get to the Garden by bus? 

The AC Transit [65 bus](https://www.actransit.org/bus-lines-schedules/65) stops at the intersection of Grizzly Peak Blvd. and Shasta Road. From there, it is a half-mile downhill walk to the Garden. Because bus routes and schedules are subject to change, we recommend you check the [AC Transit website](http://www.actransit.org/) or call 511 or [510-891-4777](tel:510-891-4777) for current information.

  * ####  Is the Garden accessible by wheelchair? 

The Garden was built into a canyon in 1940, and much of it is on steep terrain with narrow paths. The Garden staff has endeavored to create premium displays along fairly level or gently sloping paths. These displays can be reached by most wheelchairs, but it is still advisable to have an attendant. Even paths that are level or that slope gently may have varying surfaces, some of which may be challenging to some wheelchairs.

  * ####  Is it possible to visit the Garden in the rain? 

The Garden is open rain or shine. It is beautiful at all times of year and in all kinds of weather. In the rain, manzanita bark glistens, the creek and water channels roar, and mist makes the groves of trees appear mysterious and magical. Bundle up in waterproof clothing and shoes, as umbrellas are difficult under low-hanging branches or on paths between tall shrubs.

  * ####  Where are the restrooms? 

The public restroom facilities for the Garden are located in the parking lot on Wildcat Canyon Road across the street from the main entrance to the Garden.

  * ####  Are there picnic areas in the Garden? 

There are no formal or reservable picnic areas, but there are places to picnic informally in the Garden. Although we do not have picnic tables, there are numerous benches and lawn areas around the Garden. 

  * ####  May I bring a group or class to the Garden without scheduling a tour? 

Yes. All groups must follow our [Guidelines for Visitors](/visit/guidelines-for-visitors).

Yes. For the latest information and requirements for weddings, see [Reservations & Permits](/visit/weddings-and-memorials/).

  * ####  May I walk my dog, ride my bicycle, or play with balls or Frisbees in the Garden? 

We do not allow any of the above activities in the Garden. Skateboards, and rollerblades are also prohibited. Because the Garden is a living museum of plants, many of which are rare and fragile, we ask that you follow our rules, which are designed to protect the plants and assure visitors' health and safety. See [Guidelines for Visitors](/visit/guidelines-for-visitors) for more information.

  * ####  Where can I lock my bicycle at the Garden? 

You can lock your bicycle to the bike rack next to the parking lot. We do not recommend leaving unlocked bicycles unattended in the Garden.

  * ####  Does the Garden have a gift shop? 

Due to its small size and staff, the Garden does not have a gift shop. However, seeds are sold in the Visitor's Center and plants and seeds are sold occasionally. For details, see [Plant & Seed Sales](/visit/plant-sales).

  * ####  Is there a place to get food or beverages at the Garden? 

Other than the four drinking fountains located in the parking lot and the Shasta-Klamath, Redwood, Franciscan, sections of the Garden, we do not offer any food or drink. The nearest food concessions are the Grizzly Grill at the [Tilden Park Golf Course](https://www.tildenparkgc.com/) (open year-round) and the snack stand at the [Tilden Park Merry-Go-Round](https://tildenmerrygoround.org/) (open seasonally). You are welcome to bring food into the Garden. All visitors must pack out their trash after picnics and events.

  * ####  Where is the trail to Lake Anza? 

The Wildcat Gorge Trail leading to Lake Anza is not accessible from inside the Garden. However, you can reach it from a trailhead just outside the Garden on Anza View Road beyond the Brazil building.

### Garden Facts

  * ####  How old is the Garden? 

The Regional Parks Botanic Garden was founded on Jan. 1, 1940.

  * ####  What is the size of the Garden? 

The Garden is approximately 10 acres in size.

  * ####  Is the Garden publicly or privately owned? 

The Garden is owned and operated by the [East Bay Regional Park District](https://www.ebparks.org/), a special-purpose district that operates the largest urban park system in the United States. The East Bay Regional Park District is a public agency.

  * ####  Do you have a rose garden? 

California has nine species of native roses and we grow them throughout the Garden. However, we do not have a formal rose garden. Formal public rose gardens in our area include the [City of Berkeley Rose Garden](https://berkeleyca.gov/community-recreation/parks-recreation/parks/berkeley-rose-garden), the [Morcom Rose Garden](https://www.oaklandca.gov/topics/morcom-rose-garden), and the Garden of Old Roses at the [University of California Botanical Garden](http://botanicalgarden.berkeley.edu/).

  * ####  Where is the cactus garden? 

We have a fine collection of desert plants that includes a number of species of cacti. The [University of California Botanical Garden at Berkeley](http://botanicalgarden.berkeley.edu/) has a large cactus collection.

  * ####  Why do you water the plants in the Garden? Aren't California native plants drought tolerant? 

California is unique in the world in its diversity of habitats, topography, and climates. In some parts of the state, annual rainfall is less than 10 inches a year and plants native to these areas are tolerant of prolonged summer drought. In other areas, rainfall is much more plentiful and fog drip can contribute the equivalent of several additional inches of rain during the summer. 

The Garden's collection includes plants from many different parts of the state. Plants from areas with more summer moisture or cooler temperatures than those in our Berkeley hills location need supplemental water in the summer to survive. Other plants need supplemental water because our clay soil limits the depth of their root systems, or because they grow at high elevation in the wild and need to be kept cool in our warmer climate. In addition, we water some plants that are adapted to survive summer drought by drying or going dormant to keep them looking fresh for our visitors.




### Plant Sales

  * ####  Where can I buy native plants? 

The [California Native Plant Resource Guide](/publications/resource-guide#gardening) lists nurseries where you can buy native plants. Many of the nurseries offer a discount if you become a [member](/support/become-a-friend) of the Friends of the Botanic Garden.

  * ####  Do you sell native plants? When is the plant sale? 

Yes. For details, see [Plant & Seed Sales](/visit/plant-sales).

  * ####  How do your prices and selection of plants compare to commercial nurseries? 

Thanks to the efforts of volunteers, the prices of our plants are quite reasonable compared to commercial nurseries. Our selection of California native plants is very broad and includes a number of species that are not available anywhere else.

  * ####  May I donate my empty pots to the Garden? 

Because of concerns of [Phytophthora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytophthora) __ and the best practices for managing it, the Garden cannot accept pots, even if they came from the Garden.

  * ####  What and where is Native Here Nursery? 

[Native Here Nursery](https://nativeherenursery.org/), a project of the [East Bay chapter of the California Native Plant Society](https://ebcnps.org/gardening-with-native-plants/), is a volunteer-run, nonprofit nursery specializing in plants native to Alameda and Contra Costa counties. Native Here Nursery is located on Golf Course Road across from the entrance to the Tilden Park Golf Course. Native Here Nursery is not affiliated with the Regional Parks Botanic Garden.
