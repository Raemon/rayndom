Dee Himes will share her love of the Calochortus genus with a highlighted summary presentation. Calochortus is in the Liliaceae family and it is in California that has the greatest number of taxa than any other states or North America. There is at least one Calochortus in a given county in California. She will highlight distributions with maps and charts, and show morphological differences between the species, and most importantly showing pictures of some of the beautiful flowers she and her husband, Ken have come across during their three year treasure hunt. For a preview, see her YouTube [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpi261ywgQ&ab_channel=CNPSSantaClaraValley).

Dee Himes worked as a professional Horticulturist in landscape maintenance in the Bay Area. She has great interests in Botany, Geology, Ecology, Habitat restorations, Fauna, and photography. Dee has been active member volunteering for the CNPS Santa Clara Valley Chapter since 2012.
