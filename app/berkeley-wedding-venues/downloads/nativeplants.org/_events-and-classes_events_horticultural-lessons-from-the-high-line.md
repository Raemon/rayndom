The High Line is the most famous example of Dutch garden designer Piet Oudolf's four-season, naturalistic garden designs. The High Line also serves as an important example of urban ecology, featuring many native plants and providing access to nature for many species, most importantly for the more than six million annual human visitors. Join senior director of horticulture, Richard Hayden for an exploration of the ecological habitats, important native plants and the horticultural techniques for evolving and caring for this New York City treasure. This talk will be via ZOOM only.
