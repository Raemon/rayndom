# Gallery 2: Prototyping

![Bustling space in Gallery 2 with people prototyping new exhibits and trying out new things..](/sites/default/files/styles/responsive_200w/public/2024-12/Gallery2_marquee.jpg.webp?itok=Rf0Dv3i2)

Gallery 2: Prototyping

Make it. Test it. Repeat.

We make exhibits here—for our museum and other institutions around the world.

Try out our latest prototypes, shaped and reshaped by the creativity of our builders and by feedback from our visitors. Discover where our ideas come from. Take a peek into our machine shop where we make our exhibits.

And explore your own creativity with hands-on activities in the Tinkering Studio and at the Marble Wall.

How do we make new exhibits here?

_See how we make new exhibits._

####  Special dates and times

## Prototypes

No exhibit starts out fully formed. Each begins as a concept that evolves as it is made and remade, over and over.

That’s where you come in.

By trying out these exhibits and sometimes giving us feedback, you show us what sparks curiosity and what could be improved.

Step into the process. Test our prototypes on display in The Workshop to help them develop into unforgettable experiences for the Exploratorium and our collaborator museums around the world.

## Tinkering Studio

In this public workshop area, visitors are invited to slow down and become deeply engaged in investigating tools and materials, and in making something that embodies their own learning and creativity.

## Exhibit Development Workshop

This is where Exploratorium staff develop, build, and maintain all of our exhibits using a wide variety of tools, materials and technologies. Our exhibits and the Exploratorium itself are constantly being prototyped and are perpetual works in progress.
