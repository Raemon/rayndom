Floater Theater | Nina Katachadorian

[_Floater Theater_](https://www.exploratorium.edu/video/floater-theater-nina-katachadorian) is an intimate theatrical environment that whimsically prompts participants to explore the fascinating, commonly experienced phenomenon of eye floaters.

During [Katchadourian](https://www.exploratorium.edu/arts/artists/nina-katchadourian)’s residency she became curious about boredom. Are the wanderings of the mind important to creativity? What do we do when we’re bored? She pondered how the phenomena that we associate with boredom, as well as the minutiae that we find ourselves contemplating when we lack stimulation—dust, empty rooms, white noise— can actually be quite fascinating. This led to an exploration of eye floaters, and the language used to describe this observable phenomenon in our visual field that others cannot directly experience.
