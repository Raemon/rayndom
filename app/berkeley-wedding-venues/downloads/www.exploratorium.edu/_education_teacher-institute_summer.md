### About the Teacher Institute

Since 1984, the Exploratorium Teacher Institute has offered summer professional development programs for middle and high school science teachers. Our mission is to create and support a collaborative community of teachers, at all levels of their careers, through professional development that joyfully emphasizes the teaching and learning of science as a process for understanding the world around us. 

We believe that:

  * learning is joyful
  * we learn science by doing science
  * all of us are both teachers and learners
  * science classrooms should be anti-racist and equitable spaces



The Teacher Institute is committed to building and supporting a diverse, inclusive, and equitable community. We are committed to prioritizing teachers of color and teachers who work with primarily students of color. Educators of color and educators working in public schools, especially Title I schools, are encouraged to apply. 

Please email [teacherinstitute@exploratorium.edu](mailto:teacherinstitute@exploratorium.edu) if you have any questions.
