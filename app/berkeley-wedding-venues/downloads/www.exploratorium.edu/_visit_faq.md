## Planning Your Visit

You can find all of our hours listed [here](/hours "Museum Hours").

##### When is the museum least crowded?

Quieter hours are after 3:00 p.m on weekdays and 10:00 a.m. to noon on weekend mornings. Please note that Sundays from 10:00 a.m. to noon are reserved for members.

##### How long should I expect to spend at the museum?

The typical visitor spends 2–4 hours at the museum, but you are welcome to stay all day.

##### Where is the Exploratorium located and how do I get there?

We’re at Pier 15, which is on the Embarcadero at Green Street in San Francisco. You can find directions, information on public transportation, and parking options [here](/visit#getting-here). You can also call us at 415.528.4444 for additional help.

##### Is there a loading zone to drop people off before I park?

There is a white-curbed loading zone on the Embarcadero, just south of the museum, where you can drop people off or pick them up.

##### What should I wear?

Wear comfortable clothes and shoes. We recommend dressing in layers so that you're ready for whatever San Francisco weather comes your way. The Exploratorium campus covers 3.3 acres so expect to do plenty of walking.

##### Is there a coat check or a place to store my belongings?

Small and large lockers are available for a fee for items you do not wish to carry! Indoor lockers (11.5 "w x 13 "h x 17.5" d) are available just past the Ticketing Desk.

## At the Museum

##### Is the Exploratorium just a kids’ museum?

No, our exhibits can be enjoyed by visitors of all ages. Some exhibits and programs are best appreciated by adults while [others are very popular with kids and toddlers](/visit/parent-tips "Tips for Visiting the Exploratorium with Kids"). And every Thursday night [After Dark (ages 18+)](/visit/calendar/after-dark "After Dark Thursday Nights") offers thoughtful and innovative science, arts, and perceptual programming.

##### Does the Exploratorium have adults only hours?

We do. Every Thursday night! [Learn more here.](/visit/calendar/after-dark "After Dark Thursday Nights")

##### Do you have tips for visiting the museum with kids?

[We do!](/visit/parent-tips "Tips for Visiting the Exploratorium with Kids")

##### Can I drop my child off to explore the museum on their own?

Parents and caregivers are responsible for the supervision of their children. Museum staff cannot take the place of a parent or assume responsibility for unsupervised children. 

Children aged 12 and under must be supervised at all times and in the immediate presence of a parent or other responsible caregiver (18+) identified by a parent/guardian. 

Children aged 13 and older may be unsupervised provided that: They are able to behave appropriately while unsupervised. The length of time they are left alone does not exceed the child’s comfort level. They are, at all times, the legal responsibility of their parent/legal guardian and have an emergency contact available who can come and pick them up at the museum on short notice. 

Unsupervised children must be picked up prior to the regularly scheduled closing time of the museum. If a child is not picked up by the regularly scheduled closing time the museum staff will call the police to take custody of the child.

##### Will I have access to the entire museum during my visit?

Generally yes, but we do occasionally have [gallery closures for private events](/hours#special).

##### Where can I find the specific exhibit I’m looking for?

Exhibits move around and sometimes move off of the floor and to our Development Shop for repairs. If you’re looking for a particular exhibit, you can find its current location [here](/exhibits "Explore Our Exhibits").

##### Is this the place with the planetarium/aquarium?

The Exploratorium does not have a planetarium or an aquarium. You might be confusing us with the California Academy of Sciences, another great San Francisco museum. We encourage you to visit both.

##### Do I have to leave the museum at a specific time?

No. You're welcome to stay until closing no matter what time you enter.

##### Is it okay to shoot photos and video in the museum?

Informal photography and video for personal use, including engagement and wedding shoots, are allowed during regular public hours as long as other visitors' experiences are not disrupted and the photos are for noncommercial use. Photography of strangers is not allowed for any reason without the person’s (or their guardian's) express, written consent. 

Any photography, filming, or recording intended for publication in television or film or on radio must be approved by the Marketing Department ([media@exploratorium.edu](mailto:media@exploratorium.edu)). In addition, any photo shoots outside of regular public hours or any photography that blocks access to exhibits, requires extra lighting, or results in any other potentially disruptive activity must be arranged through the [Museum Rentals Department](/rentals "Private & Corporate Event Rentals").

##### How do I contact the lost and found?

Go to the Information Desk and a staff member will assist you. You may also reach our Lost and Found voicemail line at 415.528.4893.

##### What is your weapons policy?

The use or possession of any type of weapon, firearm, or explosive is strictly prohibited. This prohibition applies to all visitors and staff, including those with firearm permits and off-duty law enforcement personnel.

##### Where can I find additional help on site at the museum?

Ask any staff member wearing a colored vest or visit the Information Desk (just past the ticket scanning stations).

##### I still have questions. Who can I contact?

Call our Reservations Office at 415.528.4444 and choose option 5. Someone is available to answer your call from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. daily, with extended hours from 9:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. on Thursdays.
