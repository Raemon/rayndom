# Fisher Bay Observatory Gallery 6: Observing Landscapes

Fisher Bay Observatory

Gallery 6

Observing Landscapes

###### Uncover the history, geography, and ecology of the Bay Area.

Natural and human forces interact to create the dynamic landscape surrounding us. Learn to uncover the stories embedded in a place by directly observing the geography, history, and ecology of the San Francisco Bay region.

##### Read the Curators' Statement

This second-floor, indoor/outdoor exhibition space features spectacular views of the Bay and San Francisco’s northern waterfront, as well as its urban, downtown cityscape. The Fisher Bay Observatory Gallery and Terrace use these views as an entry point for investigations of the history and dynamic processes in the local landscape, and the human impact. 

The exhibits, artworks, and instruments here probe the environment from multiple perspectives, such as physical and geographic sciences, ecology, astronomy, history, and contemporary experience. A small browsing library of maps and books from the past and present helps visitors explore ideas that shape the Bay Area.

The Fisher Bay Observatory Gallery also introduces visitors to the process of observation, and the tools and methods scientists use to gather information about the world around us. Some instruments like cameras and telescopes help us observe the landscape directly, while other exhibits present live or archived data or, visualizations, and eventually video streams, creating a picture of our surroundings that we otherwise might never see.
