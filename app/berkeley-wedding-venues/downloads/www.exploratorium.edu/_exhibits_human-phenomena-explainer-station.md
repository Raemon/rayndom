Human Phenomena Explainer Station

Explainers are stationed throughout the Exploratorium doing structured and open-ended demonstrations. Ask an orange-vested Explainer to help you explore.

**Magic**  
Everything is not as it seems—at first. Pick a card, any card, and watch the Explainers reveal some surprising aspects of human perception.

**Philosophy (Where do you sit?)**  
"Should we always tell the truth?" Have thoughtful discussions on philosophical questions that don't have right answers.
