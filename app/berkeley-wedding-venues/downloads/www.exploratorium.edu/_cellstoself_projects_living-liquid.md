Living Liquid

The goal of Living Liquid was to discover ways to design exhibits that allow visitors to explore and ask questions about scientific data sets, through interactive data visualizations about marine life.

### Interactive Visualizations of Scientific Data Sets

The goal of Living Liquid was to discover ways to design interactive exhibits that allow visitors to explore  _data sets_ —large collections of scientific data—and ask questions about that data. The project, funded by the National Science Foundation, did this through the development of screen-based interactive visualizations of data about marine life.

As more and more scientific research involves looking at large data sets like genome sequences, this presents a challenge to museums: How can we best enable visitors to understand and engage with these datasets? What design features in an interactive visualization help visitors ask and answer questions about the data?

Living Liquid developed three interactive data visualizations for use on a multitouch table:

  * [Plankton Populations](/exhibits/plankton-populations "Plankton Populations") __ explores the ever-changing population of plankton throughout the world’s oceans, with data from [MIT’s Darwin Project](http://darwinproject.mit.edu/).
  * [Mapping Migrations](/exhibits/mapping-migrations "Mapping Migrations") investigates the migration of the ocean’s top predators, with data from the [Tagging of Pacific Predators project](http://gtopp.org/).
  * Sea of Genes looked at the plankton behaviors through data about which genes the plankton are activating at different times, with data from the [Simons Collaboration on Ocean Processes and Ecology](http://scope.soest.hawaii.edu/).
