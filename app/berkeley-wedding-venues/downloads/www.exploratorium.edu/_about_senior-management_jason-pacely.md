Jason joined the Exploratorium in July 2022. He is responsible for co-creating and fostering an engaging and inclusive work environment that supports the positive contributions of our diverse employees, interns, and volunteers. Jason provides strategic leadership and support for the team that drives all Human Resources, Volunteer Engagement, and DEIA initiatives. In this role, he also partners with the internal communications team in ways that promote the timely flow of information. The organization’s commitment to anti-racism and equity, along with its “dedication to awareness” is what inspires his work and drives his efforts. 

A native of Detroit, Jason has over 20 years of domestic and international experience in organizational development, coaching, training, DEI, and HR. Jason has worked in for profit, nonprofit, academic, and government organizations, and across several industries. He has had the opportunity to support and collaborate with several leadership teams, including Gulfstream Aerospace, Southern California Gas Company, The Aerospace Corporation, and Oracle. When not working, Jason enjoys spending time with family, traveling, listening to music or audiobooks, and sports.
