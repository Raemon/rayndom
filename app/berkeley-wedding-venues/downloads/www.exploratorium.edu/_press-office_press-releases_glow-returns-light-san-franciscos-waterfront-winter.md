**SAN FRANCISCO (October 14, 2025)** – The Exploratorium’s much-anticipated winter exhibition, [_Glow_](https://www.exploratorium.edu/visit/calendar/glow), returns this season to transform Pier 15 into a luminous playground of light, art, and science. Running from November 20, 2025, through January 25, 2026, the annual exhibition invites artists from around the world to illuminate the waterfront museum with stunning sculptures and immersive experiences that dazzle, surprise, and inspire.

From optical illusions to hundreds of suspended orbs,_Glow_ showcases both captivating new works and returning favorites that ignite the imagination and spark curiosity. Visitors are invited to listen to the sounds of color, wander a city of shadows, bask in the shimmer of an artificial sun, and explore many more radiant encounters.

"This year’s _Glow_ takes our celebration of light, art, and science to an entirely new scale,” said Allison Roach, Director of Temporary Exhibitions. “With larger-than-life installations and immersive environments, some pieces invite hands-on exploration while others inspire awe from a distance. We can’t wait to welcome visitors back to experience the surprise, delight, and curiosity that _Glow_ brings to all ages.”

This year’s _Glow_ exhibition features an exciting lineup of artworks that invite visitors to encounter light in captivating and unexpected ways. Highlights include:

  * _Aperture Lucida_ by Tristan Duke: Marvel at an optical illusion sculpture that challenges your perception of light and structure
  *  _The Thawing Of…_ by Akiko Nakayama: Be mesmerized by an ever-shifting landscape composed with unique materials and textures
  *  _Reflecting Holons_ by Martens & Visser: Bliss out under shimmering sculptures that reflect and refract rainbow-colored lights
  *  _The Dreamer IV_ by Angela Yuen: Wander a sculptural city built from found objects
  * Wave by Squidsoup: Experience nearly 500 suspended orbs in the form of a breaking ocean wave, brought to life with light and sound
  *  _Star-filled Void_ by Maja Petric: Turn your shadows into stars in a glittering constellation
  *  _One’s Sunset Is Another One’s Sunrise_ by Jacqueline Hen: Bask in the glow of an artificial sun made of moving mirrors
  *  _Line Wobbler_ by Robin Baumgarten: Play with experimental LED dungeon crawlers

“We’re thrilled to welcome Tristan Duke’s _Aperture Lucida_ back to the Exploratorium,” said Ann Meisinger, Project Director, Artist-in-Residence Program. “Tristan was our Artist-in-Residence from 2017 to 2019 and he brings a background in photography, holography, and a deep interest in the science of optics and visual perception. _Aperture Lucida_ exemplifies this spirit of inquiry, it’s a mesmerizing optical illusion that invites visitors to step inside the Black Box where a holographic ball of light appears and transforms as you move through it. It’s a striking work that challenges how we perceive light and structure, sparking wonder in ways only Tristan can create.”

Guests can also explore the thoughtfully reimagined _Sun Painting_ exhibit, originally created in 1971 by Exploratorium Artist-in-Residence Bob Miller, known for his pioneering work with dispersed light. This latest iteration honors his original vision while introducing interactive features and artificial lighting that allow the work to shine even on cloudy days or at night. _Sun Painting_ continues to radiate creativity and wonder, and will be inspiring generations to come.
