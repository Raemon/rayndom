Visualizing the Bay Area

Discover invisible processes unfolding across the Bay, the land, and the atmosphere.

A large-scale relief map of the Bay Area becomes a projection surface, where data about the region’s geology, weather, and other phenomena are animated across its topography. In our first set of visualizations (there will be more, created by partnerships with artists and scientists), you’ll see hourly changes in banks of fog, a 40-year history of earthquakes, or the shifting salinity of Bay waters responding to tides and rainfall. You’ll also see how human populations are distributed over the Bay Area by age or ethnicity. Comparing different [sets of data](/exhibits/observing-invisible-landscapes), you may discover surprising connections between seemingly unrelated human and natural phenomena.
