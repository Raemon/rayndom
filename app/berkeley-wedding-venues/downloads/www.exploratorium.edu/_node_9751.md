# The Cultural Roots of STEM

![Cultural Roots of STEM](/sites/default/files/styles/responsive_200w/public/2024-02/CSR_marquee.jpg.webp?itok=fGb-IeAN)

The Cultural Roots of STEM

A research effort exploring the diverse science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) worldviews and ways of knowing that exist beyond the dominant Western Science paradigm.

The Cultural Roots of STEM is a research effort exploring the diverse science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) worldviews and ways of knowing that exist beyond the dominant Western Science paradigm, and how actively integrating such perspectives into Informal Science Learning (ISL) environments can improve STEM engagement and learning of marginalized audiences.

Despite efforts to foster inclusivity in ISL, achieving equity remains deeply challenging. Learners and professionals in the ISL field predominantly experience STEM through a Eurocentric or Western paradigm. This reinforces and normalizes the perspectives and practices of privileged groups who have historically dominated STEM fields. Learners and professionals with worldviews and ways of knowing different from what is presented as normative in STEM may experience exclusion, face difficulties, or be pressured to assimilate, adding barriers to their engagement and success in STEM. While there is a growing commitment in ISL to broaden participation in STEM, genuine diversity cannot be attained if current efforts continue to revolve around a dominant and largely exclusive paradigm.

The Cultural Roots of STEM challenges this norm by establishing a research foundation for supporting pluralistic ways of learning and engaging with STEM in ISL environments.The first phase of the project is focused on synthesizing existing literature, published projects, and practice and poses this central research question: _What is the extent, range, and nature of existing literature on the diversity of STEM knowledge systems and ways of knowing?_

**The Cultural Roots of STEM will deliver:**

  * A research agenda for guiding future efforts on promoting science pluralism in STEM
  * A practitioner guide focusing on community-informed design strategies and best practices for integrating diverse STEM knowledge, worldviews, and ways of knowing into ISL
  * A scoping review report
  * A narrative review report



The project is led by the Exploratorium with contributions from a national advisory panel. The [Cultural Roots of STEM](https://www.informalscience.org/cultural-roots-stem-synthesis-non-western-stem-learning-paradigms) project was initiated through a grant by the National Science Foundation that was terminated on April 18, 2025 due to a change in NSF funding priorities.

The Cultural Roots of STEM represents the Exploratorium's commitment to fostering a pluralistic approach in STEM learning and underscores the importance of recognizing, valuing, and actively integrating diverse perspectives and worldviews into ISL environments. Future phases may include designing and prototyping learning experiences and the full-scale implementation of pluralistic approaches to STEM learning.
