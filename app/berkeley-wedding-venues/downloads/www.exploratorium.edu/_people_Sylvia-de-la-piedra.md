Sylvia de la Piedra provides research and evaluation support for the development of Living Systems exhibits. Her work includes in-person and online culturally responsive evaluations of visitor experience, quantitative and qualitative analyses, and a deliberate inclusion of Latinx experiences, perspectives, and identities. She holds an MS in wildlife, aquatic, and wildlands science and management from Texas Tech University. Before joining the Exploratorium, Sylvia worked with NASA satellite technology to answer questions on wildlife responses to climate change. Her ecological research has taken her to the rainforests of Madagascar, across the expansive grasslands in Kenya, into the clear blue oceans of The Bahamas, and throughout the eastern and southern United States. She has continually been involved in science outreach and education, and her work at the Exploratorium allows her to continue learning how to best facilitate public engagement with science, art, and lifelong learning.
