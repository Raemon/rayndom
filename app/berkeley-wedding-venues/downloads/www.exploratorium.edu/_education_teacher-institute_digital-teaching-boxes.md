### Middle and High School Life Science Resources

Traditionally, the Exploratorium has supported educators with physical “teaching boxes”—lessons, activities, assessments, and inexpensive supplies for a specific science unit in a single box. 

Digital Teaching Boxes are collections of life science resources designed for middle and high school teachers interested in bringing health and biomedical research-related content to students. 

This work was co-created by Exploratorium educators, research scientists, and life science teachers working in collaborative groups and was supported by a National Institute of Health [Science Education Partnership Award](https://nihsepa.org/).

#### More Life Science Resources

[ ![Snacks Alive!](/sites/default/files/styles/responsive_16_9_350w/public/pages/CritterComparison_DSC_5861-Edit_Pod.jpg.webp?h=8c6f1976&itok=HekaRxbZ)Snacks Alive! Explore living things from big to small in this life science collection.](/snacks/collection/snacks-alive)

Over the course of this project, Teacher Institute staff developed multiple new [Science Snacks](/science-snacks "Science Snacks") focused on teaching and learning life science. This collection of Snacks give students opportunities to explore phenomena related to cell biology, human variation, evolution, and more.

#### Snacks and the Next Generation Science Standards 

The course of the Digital Teaching Box project aligned with the adoption and launch of NGSS in California. In the first years of implementation, teachers, schools, districts, professional learning providers like the Exploratorium, and other stakeholders began to interpret the standards into classroom practice. As a collective vision of NGSS developed, we learned that while stand-alone classroom resources such as hands-on activities, videos, and readings are valuable, shifting pedagogy towards NGSS requires teachers to focus on the framing and sequencing of classroom activities: why and how each activity supports students in asking and answering questions to explain and understand a natural phenomenon. (To learn more about how we use Snacks to support phenomena-based teaching and learning, see the [Snacks and NGSS](/snacks/ngss "NGSS Planning Tools ") page.) 

To support teachers in designing classroom experiences in which students truly have the opportunity to figure something out, we developed a simple planning tool to help teachers create instructional sequences that center students’ observations and questions. Single activities in which students use the Science and Engineering Practices to construct knowledge about content are the raw material for an NGSS-aligned instructional sequence. 

This sequence-planning tool can be used to plan a single lesson or an entire semester of instruction and prompts teachers to look at classroom activities through the lens of the student. Activities are sequenced based on questions raised or unanswered by previous activities, so that anticipated student observations and questions determine how learning unfolds.
