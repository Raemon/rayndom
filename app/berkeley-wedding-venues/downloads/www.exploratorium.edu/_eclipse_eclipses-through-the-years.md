Eclipses Through the Years

#### Marvel at human-captured images of eclipses over the last millennium.

Eclipses have been occurring on Earth since long before humans walked the planet. Throughout time, humans have had different interpretations of and reactions to these striking celestial events. But it wasn't until the mid-19th century that people figured out how to photograph solar eclipses. Before there was photography, the only way to record what they looked like was by swiftly sketching them. Totality only lasts a few minutes, so there was limited time to draw what they observed.

**Sept. 7, 1858** \- During the Eclipse of Sept. 7, 1858 the French astronomer Emmanual Liais in Brazil rendered the corona with more distinct and detailed structure than earlier drawings. He identified an extended, smooth component onto which he superposed large, conical features along with some indication of prominences. _Credit: Emmanual Liais_
