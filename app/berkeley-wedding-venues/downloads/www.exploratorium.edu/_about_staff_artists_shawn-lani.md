Shawn Lani**** is a senior artist and curator of the Exploratorium’s [Outdoor Gallery](/visit/outdoor-gallery/) and other outdoor works. His Outdoor team created site-specific installations and commissionied a wide range of artists to help enrich and enliven the museum’s new home at Pier 15. In addition to their work at the piers, the Outdoor team is actively developing and installing public works throughout the Bay Area. As principal investigator for the NSF-funded project Ciencia Publica, Shawn led the development of portable and public interactions in predominantly Latino neighborhoods, working in partnership with San Francisco city planners and advocates for urban improvements. Shawn has also created pieces for the NSF-funded [Outdoor Exploratorium: Experiments in Noticing](/outdoor/#/vrlocation/you-are-here/). The project team installed twenty outdoor pieces at Fort Mason, a unique urban national park in San Francisco. In addition, as a member of the NOAA/Exploratorium Vision Council, Shawn advocates for artworks that create intimate experiences with broad implications. An active public artist, Shawn has participated in several national and international artist-in-residencies. His creations are installed in more than fifty museums worldwide, and he is the recipient of a National American Institute of Architects award for the monumental [LIGO Wind Wall](/sps/projects/wave-wall) installation in Livingston, Louisiana.
