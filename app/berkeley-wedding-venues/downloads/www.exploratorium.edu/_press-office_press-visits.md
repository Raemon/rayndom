Informal photography and video for personal use, including engagement and wedding shoots, are allowed during regular public hours as long as other visitors' experiences are not disrupted and the photos are for noncommercial use. Photography of strangers is not allowed for any reason without the person's (or, in the case of minors, their guardian's) express, written consent.

Any photography, filming, or recording intended for publication in television, film, radio or online must be approved by the [Communications Department](mailto:media@exploratorium.edu). In addition, any photo shoots outside of regular public hours or any photography that blocks access to exhibits, requires extra lighting, or results in any other potentially disruptive activity must be arranged through the Museum Rentals Department. For more information, please visit [Museum Rentals](/rentals "Private & Corporate Event Rentals").
