Shawn Rowe carries out research related to the intersections of everyday and STEM ways of knowing and thinking. With a background in applied linguistics and developmental psychology, his work has focused on family interactions in informal learning environments and how exhibits and other communication activities support or undermine learning for both individuals and small groups. Before joining the Exploratorium, Shawn led research efforts in free-choice learning at Oregon State University’s Hatfield Marine Science Center. He holds a PhD in Education from Washington University in St. Louis, an MS degree in multilingual/multicultural education from Florida State University, and a BS in Literature from Georgia State University.
