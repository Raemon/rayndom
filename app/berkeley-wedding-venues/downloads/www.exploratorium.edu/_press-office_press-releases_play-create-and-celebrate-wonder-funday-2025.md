**SAN FRANCISCO (September 12, 2025)** – The Exploratorium is excited to announce the return of [Wonder Funday](https://www.exploratorium.edu/support/wonder-funday) on Sunday, October 5, 2025, at Pier 15 in San Francisco. This annual fundraising event invites families, friends, and curious minds of all ages to enjoy an afternoon of hands-on science, technology, engineering, art, and math while supporting the museum’s key educational programs—including free field trips for Title I schools, the High School Explainer program, and essential classroom resources that make STEAM learning accessible to Bay Area students.

“Wonder Funday is more than an afternoon of play and discovery—it’s an investment in the next generation of explorers,” said Sydney McDowell, Co-Chair of the Family Host Committee. “When you join us, you’re ensuring that kids across the Bay Area can experience the spark of curiosity that changes lives.”

This year’s Wonder Funday event is a true STEAM Festival by the Bay. Supporters can connect with the Exploratorium's Living Systems and climate scientists, exhibit prototype developers, tinkering team, and our orange vest–wearing Explainers for a celebration of STEAM that kids from preschoolers to preteens won’t want to miss. With hands-on demos and creative art stations, visitors of all ages will find opportunities to explore, play, and imagine.

By attending Wonder Funday, guests not only share in a day of playful discovery with their kids, grandkids, and neighbors—they also ensure that thousands of Bay Area students will continue to have access to transformative STEAM experiences at the Exploratorium.
