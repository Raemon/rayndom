### Keeping an Eye on Our Changing Planet

Scientists have been studying the relationship between global climate and carbon in the atmosphere for over a century, with a growing understanding of the massive, inadvertent experiment we’re conducting with our planet. The picture is clear: carbon dioxide released into the air by the burning of fossil fuels—oil, gas, and coal—is changing the world’s climate.

The evidence comes from measurements taken by thousands of researchers, working in all domains of the physical and biological sciences, gathering data with a host of different instruments over years or often decades.

Their data paint an increasingly detailed portrait of how our planet is changing. Here, you can explore a small part of the scientific data from different realms being affected by climate change: the [Atmosphere](/climate/atmosphere "Global Climate Change Explorer: Atmosphere"), [Oceans and Water](/climate/oceans-and-water "Global Climate Change Explorer: Oceans and Water"), [Ice](/climate/ice "Global Climate Change Explorer: Ice"), and [Land and Living Systems](/climate/land-and-living-systems "Global Climate Change Explorer: Land and Living Systems"). In the [Looking Ahead](/climate/looking-ahead "Global Climate Change Explorer: Looking Ahead") section, you can explore what computer models tell us about our climate’s future, and how that may impact society. And you’ll begin to learn what can be done to slow down and adapt to climate change.
