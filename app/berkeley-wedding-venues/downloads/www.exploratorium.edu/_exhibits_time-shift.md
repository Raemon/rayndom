Time Shift

Select archived time-lapse sequences that reveal human and natural processes at work.

_Time Shift_ is a visual work that allows viewers to browse and select from an archive of time-lapse image sequences that reveal human and natural processes—many of which might otherwise go unnoticed—at work in the local landscape. Artist Ken Murphy photographed scenes throughout the Bay Area, including locations that are within sight of the Fisher Bay Observatory Gallery.
