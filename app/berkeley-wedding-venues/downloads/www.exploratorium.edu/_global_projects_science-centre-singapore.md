The Science Centre Singapore

Observing and exploring our shifting planet

The Science Centre Singapore’s (SCS) Earth Alive gallery introduces the interconnectedness and interdependence of Earth’s systems. The Exploratorium worked with SCS and the Earth Observatory of Singapore (EOS), a Research Centre of Excellence at the Nanyang Technological University of Singapore, to reimagine an existing gallery that brings Earth’s physical phenomena—earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, storms, and climate change—to life. 

The gallery covers content across four areas: atmosphere, hydrosphere, geosphere, and human sphere. Exhibits invite visitors to investigate Earth’s natural shifts and the resulting beauty and risk and to analyze the consequences of their own actions on the planet and society. 

Earth Alive opened in 2020.

**Highlights**

  * In close collaboration with EOS, we’ve helped visitors understand our shifting planet and how communities can respond to such changes. 
  * We explored the causes of Earth’s changes and their effects on multicultural Southeast Asia. 
  * We created experiences that encourage visitors to analyze the consequences of their decisions on the planet and society.
