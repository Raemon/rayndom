Rolling Through the Bay

Ping-pong balls take a spin through a toothpick San Francisco.

Artist Scott Weaver has been painstakingly constructing this replica of the city of San Francisco out of toothpicks since 1974. Ping-pong balls added here or there wind their way through the model, visiting various famous sites along the way.

Rolling Through the Bay with Scott Weaver

What’s going on?

This work-in-progress by charismatic artist Scott Weaver has a permanent home at the Exploratorium—lucky visitors may run into the artist himself, busily making additions.

It’s made from nothing but toothpicks—118,4231/2 of them, at last count—and wood glue. There are 15 different entrance points for ping-pong balls, each conducting a different “tour” through the toothpick city.

There are countless “Easter egg” surprises hidden in this sculpture. Can you find the toothpick heart Scott left in San Francisco? (Hint: Look in the Palace of Fine Arts rotunda.)
