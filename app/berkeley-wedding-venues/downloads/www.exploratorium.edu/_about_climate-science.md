# Climate Science at the Exploratorium

![Climate science](/sites/default/files/styles/responsive_200w/public/2023-03/about_climate-science_marquee.jpg.webp?itok=Zj-wDGa3)

Climate Science at the Exploratorium

The Exploratorium creates tools and experiences that help you to actively explore climate change and the environment. At our Pier 15 museum, the [Fisher Bay Observatory](/visit/gallery-6 "Fisher Bay Observatory Gallery 6: Observing Landscapes") and [Living Systems](/visit/gallery-4 "Gordon and Betty Moore Gallery 4: Living Systems") galleries encourage visitors to investigate ecosystems and environmental conditions in the Bay Area and beyond, to observe how climate change is altering this local landscape. We're one of the [first and largest zero net energy museums](/press-office/press-releases/exploratorium-achieves-historic-goal-net-zero-energy "Exploratorium achieves historic goal of Net Zero Energy operations ") in the world, and our building at Pier 15 has won numerous sustainability awards. Plus, it's fitted with sensors that help scientists better understand climate change in urban settings. Join us in moving from exploration to understanding to action.
