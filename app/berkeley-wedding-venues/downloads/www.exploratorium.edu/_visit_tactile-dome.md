## What to Expect

Walk, crawl, climb, and slide your way through a wonderland of textures using only your sense of touch as a guide.

##### Know Before You Go

The Tactile Dome is a tactile sculpture that encourages visitors to use their non-visual senses to find their way.

Bring a sense of adventure, trust in yourself, and a pair of socks! You’ll be asked to leave your belongings in the waiting area of the Dome, including jewelry, phones, and shoes.

Once inside the Dome, try to pay attention to the textures all around you—what do you hear, feel, and smell? The Dome team will be keeping an eye on you throughout your journey, ready to offer hints or guidance.

##### Restrictions

**Due to the nature of this experience, certain restrictions apply.**

Children must be at least seven years old to participate. Guests who are afraid of the dark; claustrophobic; have back, neck, or knee injuries; or are in their third trimester of pregnancy should not participate. Guests wearing casts are prohibited. Also, please wear comfortable clothes.

##### Accessibility

The Tactile Dome provides a unique perceptual experience as you travel through a series of various textures in total darkness. A portion of the Tactile Dome is wheelchair accessible. Traversing the entire exhibit requires the ability to crawl, climb, and slide. Visitors with adequate upper-body strength to perform those moves are welcome to enjoy the full experience. Sign language interpreters or other necessary attendants are admitted free of charge, but advance notice must be given if they accompany a party. Service animals are welcome in the Tactile Dome lobby but cannot journey through the Dome.

### About the Tactile Dome

**Can you find your way in total darkness guided only by your sense of touch?**

August F. Coppola sought to answer this question when he created the Tactile Dome in 1971. A member of the Participatory Art movement, which involved participants as part of the exhibits, Coppola developed the Tactile Dome with Carl Day. The two believed that facilitating touch and interaction between people and art have the power to change lifestyles—even whole societies. 

Through the decades, the Dome has lived a storied life. In the 70s, Visitors would venture through it naked believing that foregoing clothes would heighten their senses in the dark (don’t worry, the Dome at Pier 15 was built in 2013). In the 1990s, an area in the Dome was filled with rubber rats, delighting some children while scaring others. 

These days, the Dome is an integral part of the Exploratorium—it’s literally built into the foundation of Pier 15—and it’s run by our trusted Visitor Services team.

**Coppola… that name sounds familiar.**

August F. Coppola (1934—2009) was father of actor Nicolas Cage and brother of filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola. He was an arts advocate and taught literature throughout California, including at San Francisco State University.
