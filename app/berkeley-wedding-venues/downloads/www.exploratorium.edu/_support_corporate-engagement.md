## Our Luminary Partners

We thank these extraordinary supporters for their generous contributions to the Exploratorium.

##### LEGO

![LEGO Luminary Partner](/sites/default/files/styles/webp/public/2024-03/52702794491_2aaf66004f_o.jpg.webp?itok=JuLS4-tG)

At the Exploratorium, it is our mission to ignite curiosity and foster a love for learning in children and families alike. As one of the seventeen proud partner museums of the LEGO Playful Learning Museum Network, we are thrilled to collaborate with like-minded institutions across the country to champion the power of play in informal education.

Thanks to the generosity of the LEGO Group, we are able to further our mission of providing dynamic, hands-on learning experiences in our community. This support enables us to participate fully in the LEGO Playful Learning Museum Network, where educators from diverse backgrounds come together to develop and share best practices for tinkering and exploration.

The LEGO Playful Learning Museum Network serves as a valuable platform for exchanging ideas, resources, and expertise. Through this collaborative effort, we are empowered to create innovative learning environments that engage and inspire children of all ages. Together, we are redefining the role of museums in education, making learning a fun and accessible experience for everyone.

##### Waymo

You may have seen self-driving cars passing you on the streets of San Francisco. Have you ever wondered how these vehicles can “see” the world around them? To demonstrate to our visitors the science behind this feat of technology, the Exploratorium partnered with autonomous car company Waymo to create a new exhibit that was featured during our reopening.

Waymo worked closely with the Exploratorium design team to create Sensor Fusion, an interactive exhibit that demystifies LIDAR (light detection and ranging) technology. This technology is becoming increasingly common, and has the potential to change not only transportation, but also fields such as surveying, archaeology, geology, and forestry. Sensor Fusion made a playful addition to the Exploratorium’s seeing and perception exhibits in Bechtel Gallery 3.

Waymo joined the Exploratorium as the Presenting Sponsor of our July 2021 reopening. Waymo is an autonomous driving technology company with a mission to make it safe and easy for people and things to get where they're going.
