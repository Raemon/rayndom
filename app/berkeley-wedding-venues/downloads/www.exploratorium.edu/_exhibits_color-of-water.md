Color of Water

Why is the Bay's color always changing?

Water reflects the blue of the sky, but if you look down into it, its color is based mostly on the green of marine algae— _phytoplankton_ —and the brown of suspended silt. This array of color chips lets viewers determine what’s influencing the color of water today.
