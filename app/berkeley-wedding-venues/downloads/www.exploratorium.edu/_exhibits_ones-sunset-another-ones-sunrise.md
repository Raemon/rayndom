Jacqueline Hen, 2024

One’s Sunset Is Another One’s Sunrise

 _OSIAOS_ is made from thousands of acrylic mirrors that move independently, plus a ring of LEDs that create a warm, orange glow. This artificial Sun shines day and night, never rising or setting. Shining a spotlight at the moving mirrors creates scattered reflections that dance hypnotically on the floor.

About the Artist

Jacqueline Hen works at the intersection of design, art, and research, exploring possibilities for social transformation through communication and participation. Her large-scale performative installations investigate _proprioception_ —the ability to know where our body is in space.
