Ideas are Between Us: The R&D Process of Tinkering Studio

###### Unspoken Principles: "Ideas Are Between Us"

When our Tinkering Studio team is engaged in R&D to develop new activities, some unspoken principles guide us. One of them, I’d like to call "Ideas are between us." This concept reflects our belief that ideas are a collective phenomenon; they emerge and thrive in the space between us, through our interactions and shared experiences. I became aware of this shared idea space and got interested in unpacking further.

In this blog post, I’d like to delve deeper into what happens in this shared idea space of “Ideas are between us”, using the development of __[_Tinker with a View_](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRDiBwD_q418woUwQGPkn3n2LXwMl4-SjAxBQMa96vRarb-d-GkZ8BOufCu7iMUlA2wuJG6CSZMiLCb/pub?delayms=30000&loop=true&start=true&slide=id.g28dee9577ae_0_129) __ with [OctoStudio](https://octostudio.org/en/) activities as an example. This idea map above showcases the range of concepts we explored to develop the _Tinker with a View_ activity with multiple collaborators.

###### Exploring Shared Idea Space through "Tinker with a View"

![A group of people, including an adult and children, standing in a classroom setting.](/sites/default/files/styles/webp/public/2024-06/52769100859_94775981a1_c.jpg.webp?itok=w-Bgzzq3)

The _Tinker with a View_ activity invites learners to create an interactive scene or story viewed through a window, using OctoStudio, craft materials, and accessories like magnets. The windows are embedded into a cardboard house, and learners are encouraged to create a collaborative scene using paper overlays or frames, engaging in physical-digital tinkering with OctoStudio. 

**Initial Spark and Tangent Ideas**

Let’s take a closer look. This activity development began with the prompt "Bring a book to life." We initially planned to explore the intersection of stories, OctoStudio, and everyday materials using books. Since I didn't have a particular book in mind, I created a simple pop-up card embedded with a phone to tell a short story during our R&D time. When my team saw it, they were excited about embedding a phone in a pop-up card because it provides a physical environment that naturally supports storytelling. 

![the wide range of activity ideas](/sites/default/files/styles/webp/public/2024-06/Screenshot%202024-06-18%20at%209.50.33%20AM.png.webp?itok=d5lhkM6v)

From that initial spark, many tangent ideas emerged. Steph created a cardboard case to embed her OctoStudio phone and used a paper overlay to make an interactive story about her plants. Eric from the Lifelong Kindergarten group created a house-shaped phone case with window cut-outs to tell a story about his cat. We were all fascinated by the idea of combining OctoStudio with paper cut-outs, realizing it offers opportunities for everyone to create and share their diverse stories, views, and worlds both digitally and physically.

**Wide Range of Explorations**

Not all of them directly contributed to _Tinker with a View_ , but I wanted to share some of the other tangent ideas below to show the wide range of explorations branching out from the initial prompt. Some of them developed independently into separate activities.

Sebastian experiments with activating the touchscreen and sound through the paper overlay.

This idea emerged while exploring materials _other than_ paper. Placing a hinged mirror on top of the phone to reflect OctoStudio animations in a kaleidoscopic way.

![A cardboard box with an iPad inside showing Peppers Ghost effect](/sites/default/files/styles/webp/public/2024-06/Screen%20Shot%202023-04-14%20at%205.06.41%20PM.png.webp?itok=FzC7-B-q)

This idea is adjacent to the kaleidoscope concept but uses a clear acrylic board instead of a mirror. By setting a clear acrylic board at an angle on a tablet and shining a light, it makes a character appear to leap off the screen like Pepper's ghost.

**Evolving Ideas: Windows as a Generative Concept**

Around this time, Celeste from the Creative Communities research group at CU Boulder was at the residence with us in the Tinkering Studio, and we decided that we wanted to do an OctoStudio activity on the floor. 

After experimenting with various cut-out designs, we realized window cut-outs might be the most [generative and open-ended](https://vimeo.com/937983809). This inspired us to create a large collective cardboard house with cut-out windows. 

This idea evolved significantly from our initial prompt "Bring a book to life," showing how new ideas emerge among us.

**Sharing and Iterating Ideas**

The _Tinker with a View_ activity using OctoStudio was subsequently shared at several [conferences](/tinkering/blog/cardboard-code-creating-multiple-materials "From Cardboard to Code: Creating with Multiple Materials") and tried out in various workshops, not just using the house metaphor but in different formats as well. The development process for this activity is still ongoing.

###### Principles of Tinkering R&D: Collaborative Idea Sharing

The principle of sharing ideas between us is what makes our R&D successful. Ideas don't reside solely in an individual's mind; they evolve in the collaborative space "between" us as people willingly share their tentative thoughts. Sometimes it's hard to remember whose idea it originally was because so many team members take up the idea, experiment with it, and change them so that they become 'ours.' As Keith Sawyer says in his book[ "Group Genius"](https://a.co/d/0e1d00Ve), the creative process is improvisational. It starts with a small intuition or thought, and the group engages in a wandering and iterative process. Consequently, the final outcome often differs significantly from the original idea.

This perspective aligns with our approach to learning as well: learning is social, not an individual activity. It’s collective. The processes of learning and tinkering R&D are similar. So when we conduct R&D within our team, it naturally becomes a collective and collaborative effort. Ideas take shape and grow as they are exchanged and built upon within our community. This approach is also non-goal oriented. In both tinkering and our R&D, there are many pivots and shifts during the process, which can make the final outcomes significantly different from what was originally planned, and we think that’s totally okay. In fact, we embrace it. 

###### Concrete Practices for Collaborative Idea Development

Finally, I’d like to share some of the concrete practices we follow to support the principle of “Ideas are between us.” There might be more, but here are some of the main ones:

  * **Share half-baked ideas** : Embrace the power of “Just experimenting” and “What happens if...?” Share ideas while they are still developing or 'half-baked', recognizing that these preliminary thoughts, even if likely to fail or be discarded, can ignite creative insights and further exploration.

  * **Communicate through tangibles** : Get ideas out of your head and into the world. Turn them into objects-to-think-with. One of the best ways to develop tinkering activities is to quickly start making physical working prototypes. By turning ideas into tangible forms right away, you can move beyond speculation and see what really works through real-world testing and concrete examples.

  * **Engage in direct and shared experiences together** : Tinker together. Conduct R&D as a team. Create a shared exploration space and have direct experiences that everyone can reference and reflect on. Ensure there is time allocated for reflection, which can be used to converge and remix the emerging ideas to shape the exploration space.

  * **Document, document, document** : Unpolished videos and photos are welcome as the focus is on exchanging ideas and thoughts, rather than waiting for polished presentations. Through documentation, ideas are not only recorded but also communicated to a wider audience, facilitating collaboration and inspiration.




So where do these shared ideas lead? While the principle of “Ideas are between us” is crucial in the early stages of our R&D process, once ideas begin to come together, we move into a hands-on iterative development process. This is where we see if our concepts truly become playful, tinkerable activities. But that’s a story for another time. For now, let’s continue to embrace the collaborative space where our ideas are born and nurtured.
