Pi Day

Celebrate Pi Day at its birthplace! This irrational and transcendent holiday was founded in 1988 at the Exploratorium, and has since grown into an international phenomenon. Join in our annual procession around the Pi Shrine, enjoy slices of delicious pie, and think beyond circles and spheres with surprising exhibits about math and how it informs the world.
