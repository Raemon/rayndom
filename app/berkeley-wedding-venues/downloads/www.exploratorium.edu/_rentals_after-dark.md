After Dark Thursday Rental Options

The museum is open to the public for adults only (18+) on Thursday nights from 6:00 PM - 10:00 PM. We're happy to offer private and semi-private rentals on Thursday nights that include admission to After Dark for your guests. 

With 700+ interactive exhibits, your guests get to play with magnetic black sand, watch plankton float in rainbow lights, and capture a moment in time in the shadow box. Our Rentals Department is happy to offer private and semi-private rentals on Thursday nights that include admission to [After Dark](/visit/calendar/after-dark?gad=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwyNSoBhA9EiwA5aYlb47Jl8p_RXdU_MFmNXE_tnyqFi1kIEvIgrT59PBdmSAvwQosz02WIBoCb5AQAvD_BwE "After Dark Thursday Nights")—all spaces are based on internal approval from our After Dark team.

### Private Gallery Options

Both of the options below are available on Thursdays with approval. They each provide a private event space for up to 200 guests, and both venues require catering service from one of our [approved catering](https://www.exploratorium.edu/visit/rentals/planning) Teams. We do not offer in-house food, beverage, or rentals and these items will need to be brought in.
