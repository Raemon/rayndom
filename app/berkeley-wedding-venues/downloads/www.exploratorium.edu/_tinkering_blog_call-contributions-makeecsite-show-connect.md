Call for Contributions! MakeEcsite Show & Connect

As we've done in years past, we'll be organizing a Tinkering and Making Space at the annual annual [European conference for science museums (Ecsite)](https://ecsite.wildapricot.org/Conference) in Ljubljana, Slovenia this coming June 5-8, 2024. As part of this pop up space, we're excited that the conference organizers are supporting an open Show & Connect session. This **Show & Connect Session** will be a chance to share all of your half-baked ideas and unpolished projects! 

![Makerspace sign](/sites/default/files/styles/webp/public/2024-03/41215087910_623acf7bbe_o%20%281%29.jpg.webp?itok=Ml1-p2Zg)

If you're interested in participating, we'll invite you to bring your tinkering and making project – especially if it’s still a work-in-progress or a rough draft – to the Tinkering and Making Space, where you’ll have the opportunity to share it with the community. We welcome all types of work and mediums including art projects, exhibit prototypes, cooking, and explorations of technology, science, and recycled materials. 

There are only 2 conditions: (1) that you bring a physical artifact or prototype of what you are working on, and (2) that you’re willing to spend time both sharing your project and giving feedback to others in the community during a 1-hour session.

### How to Join In

**Submit your tinkering & making project to Steph **[**smuscat@exploratorium.edu**](mailto:smuscat@exploratorium.edu)**and Rebecca**[**rebecca.b.buttigieg@gov.mt**](mailto:rebecca.b.buttigieg@gov.mt)**by May 20 and include:**

  * a short title and description of the project (max 150 words)
  * who will be presenting
  * special technical requirements, if any.



Photos of the projects are of course very welcome. Submissions will be evaluated on an ongoing basis and it’s first-come, first-served.

**Please note that if you are accepted to present you will be expected to join the conference, register, and pay the registration fee.** We hope to see you there!
