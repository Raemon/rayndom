# Education

Education

Dive into our education resources—and see what you discover. 

#### At the Exploratorium, we believe learning should be joyful and lifelong. 

Our hands-on experiences spark curiosity, encourage exploration, and help you make sense of the world around you. We empower learners to figure things out for themselves—about science or any new idea or claim.

We’re here to support educators like you—whether you’re a Pre-K–12 teacher, informal educator, teacher leader, or professional development provider, we offer workshops, activities, and resources designed to inspire and engage.
