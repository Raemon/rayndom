# About the Moon.

About the Moon.

### Our moon is a natural satellite that helps stabilize our climate and create the tides in our oceans.

While the star of the eclipse is the Sun, eclipses couldn’t happen without our moon. In fact, Earth is the only planet in our solar system that experiences a total solar eclipse! (Learn more about [why eclipses happen.](/explore/why-eclipses-happen-old "Why eclipses happen")) 

Our moon is a _natural satellite_ —a celestial object that orbits around something else—that helps stabilize our climate and create the tides in our oceans. While we don’t know for sure how the moon was made, scientists think it was formed when a large asteroid-like body crashed into Earth. The resulting debris was compressed into the moon we see today. 

  
In addition to peaks and valleys, the moon’s surface is covered with craters both big and small—the result of bombardment by meteorites in the early days of the solar system. While the moon once had oceans of magma (lava), it is currently very dry with extreme temperatures, and the surface is covered with powdery dust and rocky debris. For many years there was debate about whether or not there could be water in such a dry place. But in 2018, India’s Chandrayaan-1 mission confirmed that there was water in the soil at the moon’s shady poles. In 2020, the SOFIA mission confirmed that there was also water in the soil in sunlit areas.

_This image confirmed that there is water on the moon! From NASA’s Moon Mineralogy Mapper on the Chandrayaan-1 mission, it illustrates the extent to which different materials are mapped across the side of the moon that faces Earth. Small amounts of water and hydroxyl (blue) were detected on the surface of the moon at various locations. (ISRO/NASA/JPL-Caltech/Brown Univ./USGS)_

The moon always shows us the same face. This happens because of _synchronous_ rotation: the moon rotates at the same rate (one rotation in 28 days) that it orbits the Sun (one orbit every 28 days). The phrase “dark side of the moon” refers to the far side of the moon that is never seen from Earth, although it is only truly dark for half of the moon’s orbit.

Because the moon is smaller than Earth, it has less gravity—about one-sixth the amount, which means that you could jump six times higher on the moon! It also means that if you weighed 100 pounds on Earth, you would only be 16.6 pounds on the moon. Only 12 humans have ever walked on the moon—all men from NASA’s Apollo program, between 1969 and 1972. NASA has a new set of missions, called the Artemis Program, that will send humans back to the moon by 2025.
