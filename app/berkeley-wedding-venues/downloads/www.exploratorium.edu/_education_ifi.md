Institute for Inquiry

Inquiry-Based Science for Elementary Educators

## Inspiring the Future of K-5 Science Education

* * *

The Institute for Inquiry at the Exploratorium empowers elementary teachers and leaders to bring science inquiry to life in K-5 education. Rooted in the museum's legacy of hands-on learning, IFI leverages students’ natural curiosity to help them explore the world, communicate ideas, and see themselves in science.

Over many decades, IFI has evolved to meet the changing needs of educators and students, impacting hundreds of thousands of teachers worldwide, from rural classrooms to national education systems. Today, IFI collaborates with district leaders, county offices, and organizational partners across California, strategically supporting the implementation of the Next Generation Science Standards to shape the future of science education.

#### Work With Us

We provide professional development to educators and leaders in schools, districts, and county offices, and partner with state-level leaders to support inquiry-based science in elementary education. In addition to funded statewide and local work, we are available for on-demand workshops with groups of educators, professional learning providers, informal learning programs, and more.
