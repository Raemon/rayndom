#### Meet the Explainers

Your field trip will begin with an orange-vested Explainer who will welcome your students, answer questions, and cover some key details. Then they will help you explore one exhibit as a group—this is for teachers and chaperones, too, so enjoy it! 

Exploratorium founder Frank Oppenheimer wanted the museum to have enthusiastic guides who would encourage visitors to play with exhibits and discover their own questions and answers through inquiry and direct engagement. 

Explainer programs also provide science learning opportunities, career exposure, and gender and racial equity initiatives for the Explainers themselves.
