### Dive into the eclipse with our live telescope feeds and educational programming.

Since 1998, the Exploratorium and NASA have worked together to send expeditions to sites around the world to broadcast stunning images of solar eclipses. For the total solar eclipse on April 8th, 2024, we will be broadcasting live from the path of totality in Junction, Texas and Torreón, Mexico.
