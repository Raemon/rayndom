Hsin-Yi Chien's work includes quantitative analyses of visitor experience at the Exploratorium, research on visitors’ learning experience at social science exhibits, and culturally responsive research methodology and exhibition design. Before joining the Exploratorium, she received her PhD in communication at the University of Maryland, where she investigated how culture and social group membership influence various forms of social interaction and the resulting intergroup relations. She has received training in both quantitative and qualitative methodologies. Her research interests involve social and cognitive psychology, intergroup and intercultural communication, and attitude change.
