# Explainer Programs

# Explainer Programs

Explainers are a diverse group of paid youth and adult educators who facilitate learning experiences through inquiry, demos, and direct engagement.

Exploratorium founder Frank Oppenheimer wanted the Exploratorium to have enthusiastic guides, or Explainers, who would encourage visitors to play with our exhibits and discover their own questions and answers. Today there are different Explainer programs that share the same purpose: to enhance visitors' experience and to deepen the knowledge of the Explainers themselves.
