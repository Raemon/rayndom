Saturday Cinema: The Art + Science of Animated Light and Color

Presented by Cinema Arts

###### Presented by Cinema Arts

Celebrate our winter exhibition _Glow_ with a program of short, radiant animations which further the creative interplay within the arts and sciences. 

From naturally forming elements and teeming insect life, to the glowing marvels of urban environments, these films shine light on the creative and diverse ways that artists draw gleaming inspiration from cities and natural landscapes as well as the joys of human celebration.

The Cinema Arts film collection is made possible by the Louis Goldblatt Memorial Fund. Cinema Arts is sponsored in part by a grant from SF Grants for the Arts.
