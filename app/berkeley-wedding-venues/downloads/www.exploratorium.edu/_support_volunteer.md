Become a Volunteer

The unique talents of our volunteers help the Exploratorium offer its current level of services to the community.

A volunteer project at the Exploratorium is a marvelous opportunity to participate behind the scenes in this hands-on museum of science, art, and human perception. In exchange for contributing your time and sharing your talents, you can engage your curiosity by learning new things, interact with visitors and volunteers from around the world, and most of all, have fun!

The dynamic community of Exploratorium volunteers brings curiosity, enthusiasm, and dedication to its volunteer work, providing the museum with fresh perspectives and invaluable assistance. Recent volunteers have included welders, stockbrokers, architects, technical writers, research scientists, artists, teachers, and students. All adults, 18 and over are welcome to [apply](/support/volunteer/requirements-process "Apply to the Volunteer Program"), including international volunteers. We are not currently sponsoring a teen volunteer program.

Read our [notice of non-discrimination](/about/jobs#non-discrimination-notice "Work at the Exploratorium").

#### About the Volunteer Program

Volunteer projects vary throughout the year, and you don’t need to be a scientist or an expert to apply. The program is flexible, matching available opportunities to your talent and availability. Volunteers often move on to another project or area of the museum after completing their initial assignments.

Volunteers help with a wide range of projects, from exhibit maintenance to administrative tasks, from educational programs to special events. Most volunteer projects begin with one-on-one training with a staff supervisor and then develop into independent work.
