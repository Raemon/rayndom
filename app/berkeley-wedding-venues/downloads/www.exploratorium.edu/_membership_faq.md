Membership FAQ

Learn about making the most of your membership, what to expect when you visit, and how to use your digital membership card.

### Visiting as a Member

##### I just joined and am planning my first visit to the Exploratorium. What do I need?

Thank you for your support! New members will receive their digital membership card via email a few minutes after completion of their membership purchase. If you have not received your digital membership card yet, you can visit using the temporary membership pass PDF in your emailed purchase receipt, or using the temporary membership card you received if you purchased on site.

Scroll down for answers to questions about your membership card.

### Purchasing a Membership

##### Can I apply general admission tickets toward a membership?

Absolutely! You can apply your ticket purchase price toward a membership at any time on the day of your visit. The number and type of applicable tickets varies with the membership level you purchase. Tickets purchased from third-party vendors are not applicable; other restrictions may apply. Ask any Visitor Services Associate for details during your visit.

##### Can I purchase an Exploratorium membership as a gift for someone else?

Yes! An Exploratorium membership makes a wonderful gift for any occasion. When you [purchase a gift membership](/membership "Membership"), you will receive a voucher you can give as a gift. Each gift voucher has an expiration date of 120 days from the purchase date. The membership benefits start when the gift recipient redeems their gift voucher. To learn more, contact us at 415.528.4321 or [membership@exploratorium.edu](mailto:membership@exploratorium.edu).

##### Is an Exploratorium membership tax-deductible?

Yes, it is. As a donation to a nonprofit organization, your membership fees are either partially or fully tax-deductible depending on the level. You will receive a receipt by email welcome letter listing the tax-deductible amount. If you need a new copy of your receipt for tax purposes, [log into your account](https://visit.exploratorium.edu/ "Membership Login") using the email registered to the membership to resend the email receipt. Thank you for your essential support!

### Membership Benefits

##### Can members bring a guest during Member hours?

Yes! And they can get $10 off on a member-discounted ticket. Learn about guest policies below.

##### Is an Exploratorium membership reciprocal with other museums? How does that work?

Yes! The Exploratorium participates in [ASTC's Passport Program](https://www.astc.org/membership/find-an-astc-member/passport/), which entitles all of our Daytime members to free admission to 350+ science centers and museums worldwide located outside of a 90-mile radius from the Exploratorium and your home address. You can simply show your digital card at participating organizations to receive free admission! 

The Exploratorium offers free admission for members of ASTC Passport Program institutions. The benefit covers 2 people regardless of your membership level at your home institution.

##### How do I take advantage of my 10% off dining discount?

Both Daytime and After Dark members have a 10% discount on all nonalcoholic food and beverages from The Tinkering Table Restaurant and Catalyst Coffee Lab. To take advantage, simply show your membership card at the time of purchase.

##### Is it possible to get access to both After Dark and Daytime hours without buying two memberships?

Yes! Memberships at the Dual Explorers ($159) and up now include both Daytime and After Dark (ages 18+) admission. [See all benefit details here](/join "Become a Member").

##### Can I enter during Member hours with my ASTC reciprocal membership?

No. This time is reserved for members of our museum only.

### Guest Policies

##### Can a guest use my membership without being named on the membership?

That depends on your level. If you have a Dual Explorers or Curious Family membership, one named adult member can bring one adult guest if the second named adult is not visiting or if no second adult is named on the membership. Family Plus and higher levels of membership admit your unaccompanied guests if they show the digital membership card you shared with them.

##### What are the unaccompanied guest policies for my membership level?

All guests are required to possess a membership card and ID for entry.

Membership Level| Guest Allowance Per Day  
---|---  
Family Plus| Without named member, the limit is 2 adult guests + 6 children.  
Supporter / Patron| Limit is 6 guests of any age.  
[Donor Membership Levels](/support/donor-community "Join Our Donor Community")| Limit is 10 guests of any age.  
  
##### What if I have additional guests with me who are not covered for free by my membership level?

Additional guests of Daytime members are eligible for a discounted ticket rate of $10 off any regular admission. Discounted tickets are available for purchase on site.

### Digital Membership Card 

The Exploratorium is pleased to offer digital membership cards as a contact-free and environmentally friendly benefit of membership! We hope these answers to common questions will help you download and use your new digital card. Additional questions can be directed to our membership staff at 415.528.4321 or [membership@exploratorium.edu](mailto:membership@exploratorium.edu).

##### How do I add my digital membership card to my phone?

If you are an iPhone user, access your membership confirmation email from your smartphone. Click the "Add to Apple Wallet" button, then click "Add to Wallet" and "Add." The card will automatically go to your iPhone’s Apple Wallet. It can be accessed in Wallet at any time. 

If you are an Android user access your membership confirmation email from your smartphone and click “Add to Google Wallet.” Tap “Save to Google Wallet” then click “Save.” The card will automatically go to your Google Wallet where it can be accessed at any time.

##### How will I use my digital membership card?

Your digital membership card and a form of ID are required for entry. 

Also, your card is where you'll find all your up-to-date membership information—including your membership expiration date—and for Daytime members, it can be used to gain admission when you visit our ASTC Passport Program reciprocal admission partners. 

Your new digital membership card will update automatically with all of the information you’ll need.

##### I am not sure I received my digital card. Can you send it again?

Please check your junk, spam, trash, and updates folders for an email from [membership@exploratorium.edu](mailto:membership@exploratorium.edu), which will include a link to download your card. If you are still unable to find your digital card invitation, please contact us at 415.528.4321 or email membership@exploratorium.edu. We can resend the email for you to download and enjoy your digital membership card. You can also resend it yourself by [logging into your account](https://visit.exploratorium.edu/ "Membership Login") using the email registered to the membership.

##### I downloaded my card, but I can’t find it.

If you have an iPhone, the card will automatically download to Apple Wallet. Check the Wallet app for your new card. If you have an Android, your card will be in either Google Wallet or Wallet Union, whichever you choose during the download process. For both types of phone, scroll through any cards that are already in your wallet—it may be hiding!

##### I’d prefer not to use a digital membership card. What should I do?

You can show a photo ID at the Exploratorium entrance to use your admission benefits. You can also print the confirmation email you received when you completed your membership transaction. There is a QR code that can be scanned at the entrance for admission.

##### I don’t have a smartphone. What can I do?

You can show a photo ID at the Exploratorium entrance to use your admission benefits. You can also print the confirmation email you received when you completed your membership transaction. There is a QR code that can be scanned at the entrance for admission.

##### My name is spelled wrong or my membership level is incorrect. How do I fix that?

Please call 415.528.4321 or email [membership@exploratorium.edu](mailto:membership@exploratorium.edu) to update your membership record. The updates will show up on your phone within 10 days.

##### What's on the “back” of my digital card, and where do I find it?

On the “back” of your digital membership card, you’ll find helpful links to our website, your membership ID number, and details on the admission benefits included in your membership level. To see the back of the card: 

  * On your iPhone, tap on the 3 small dots at the upper right corner of your card. 
  * On your Android phone, tap on the information icon (the lowercase “i” in a circle). 
  * On the GPay app, simply scroll down to view all of your membership information. All information is on the "front" of the card.



##### What does "automatic updates" mean?

Please keep this option (on the back of your card) toggled on. This will ensure your digital card stays up to date with your membership’s current expiration date, and membership benefits.

##### If I "allow notifications," what kind of notifications will you send me?

We will send reminders when your membership benefits are about to lapse. We realize constant notifications are intrusive, and we promise to only send information pertinent to the status of your membership.

##### Will my digital card update automatically when I renew my membership?

No. If your membership information changes, you’ll need to download your digital card again. When you renew or upgrade your membership, you’ll be invited to download a new version of your card.

##### How do I share my membership?

If you have a second member named on your membership; or if you have a Family Plus, Supporter, or Patron membership, and you want to share your membership with a friend, family member, or caregiver without a named member being present; then please follow these instructions. 

  * On an iPhone, navigate to the “back” of your membership card, click on the “share” icon (tiny rectangle with upwards arrow), select iMessage, and send your card via text to the intended recipient. When they receive your text, they should tap on the image of the card, and select “Save.” The card will be added to their Wallet.
  * On an Android phone, click the “Share Pass” button to send the card to your recipient via text or email. 



 _Please note: Sharing cards is intended for temporary usage, limited to family members and friends, and must remain consistent with the terms and conditions of your membership. It is the named member’s responsibility to maintain control of their cards._
