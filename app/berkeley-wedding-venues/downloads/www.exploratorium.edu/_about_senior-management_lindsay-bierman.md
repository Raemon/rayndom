Lindsay Bierman joined the Exploratorium as Executive Director and CEO in April 2022 after a 30-year run in design, media, and higher education. Building on the radical vision of the Exploratorium’s founder, physicist Frank Oppenheimer, Lindsay drives the institution’s strategic initiatives for nearly 500 staff and volunteers across multiple lines of business, including a bayfront destination campus on San Francisco’s Embarcadero; the transformative professional development programs for educators in all of California’s 58 counties; and a preeminent global consulting team building major science centers in North America, South America, Asia, and the Middle East. 

Lindsay’s leadership at one of the world’s most influential science centers builds on his past success as a public servant. Most recently he served as CEO of PBS North Carolina, one of the nation’s largest PBS affiliates, which he transformed into a leading-edge hub for national content development, digital distribution, K–12 education services, and public safety communications. From 2014 to 2019, he built a legacy as the eighth Chancellor of the University of North Carolina School of the Arts (UNCSA), one of 17 constituent campuses in the UNC System and home to some of the highest-ranked professional training programs in the world. As a fundraiser, Lindsay amassed the largest donations in the institution’s history to significantly transform the campus community and impact thousands of exceptionally talented high school, undergraduate, graduate, community school, and summer school students.

Lindsay began his career in New York City as a designer and writer for world-renowned architect Robert A. M. Stern. Starting in 1997, he spent 17 years as a magazine editor with media giant Time Inc., where he helped launch and eventually led some of the country’s most beloved and iconic consumer brands, including the flagship title _Southern Living,_ where he served 18 million consumers each month, helped diversify the brand’s $100 million revenues through a historic economic recession, increased the coveted 18–34 audience, reduced operating costs, and won more than two dozen first-time industry awards.

Lindsay holds a BA in history from Georgetown University and an MA in architecture from the University of Virginia. He often commutes to the Exploratorium by ferry from Tiburon.
