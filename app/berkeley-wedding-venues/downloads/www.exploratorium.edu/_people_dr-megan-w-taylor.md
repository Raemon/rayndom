Dr. Megan W. Taylor leads our powerhouse team of educators, teacher educators, and scientists working to impact science teaching and learning in formal and informal systems. Dr. Taylor has taught teachers and students for over two decades in the San Francisco Bay Area, and is a Nationally Board Certified Teacher. She earned an MA and a PhD in mathematics education from Stanford University, and worked as a postdoctoral fellow in the Harvard Graduate School of Education before proudly joining the California State University system as faculty in the Sonoma State School of Education. Megan came to the Exploratorium as the Director of the Exploratorium Teacher Institute from Trellis Education, a non-profit she founded in 2015 to ensure students in California public schools have exceptional math and science teachers who share critical identities with them. 

Megan identifies as a woman, a mother, and an activist, and is committed to using her privileges to disrupt the impact of oppression and poverty in public education. Megan lives with her family in San Francisco, where she spends most of her spare time doing crossword puzzles and befriending spiders in Golden Gate Park. Megan has been an enthusiastic visitor to the Exploratorium for 4+ decades, and one of her favorite exhibits —[Chaotic Pendulum](/exhibits/chaotic-pendulum "Chaotic Pendulum")— was co-designed by her great godfather, [Nicholas Rott](https://www.nae.edu/189888/NICHOLAS-ROTT-19172006)!
