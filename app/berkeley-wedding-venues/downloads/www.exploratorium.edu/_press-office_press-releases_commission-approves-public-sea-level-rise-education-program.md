**SAN FRANCISCO (August 21, 2025)** –Today, the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission (BCDC) voted to approve a free public sea level rise education program proposed by the Port of San Francisco and the Exploratorium, which will partner to provide the program.

The Sea Level Rise Public Education Initiative will help Bay Area residents learn the causes of sea level rise, how it affects the Bay now, how it is forecasted to affect the Bay shoreline and upland locations, and how the public can get involved in creating real world solutions—using examples from the Exploratorium’s own location on the vulnerable San Francisco waterfront. The initiative will feature free exhibits along the waterfront, plus field trips and workshops for local students and teachers.

“Bay Area residents overwhelmingly agree that climate change is a critical issue,” said **BCDC Chair Zack Wasserman.** “This education program will help everyone understand how urgently we need to take action. If we don’t act fast enough, the Bay Area economy faces more than $230 billion in damage to property, critical infrastructure, and valuable natural habitat by 2050 from rising sea levels.”

“This initiative is a meaningful opportunity to help people understand their role in addressing rising sea levels,” said **Exploratorium Executive Director and CEO Lindsay Bierman**. “By empowering current and future generations with knowledge and practical tools, we can build a stronger, more resilient future for our communities.”

The commission also voted to allow more flexible types of development at Fisherman’s Wharf, the stretch of San Francisco waterfront under the Port of San Francisco’s jurisdiction running from Hyde St. Pier to Pier 39. The vote eliminated outdated rules that limited the Port’s ability to attract investment and rehabilitate the existing Piers at Fisherman’s Wharf, including a long-standing policy that limited the types of uses on replacement piers and required replacement piers to dedicate half their area to public access and open space. As a result, the Port will have more flexibility in how piers are redesigned to enhance public access, address seismic risk, and provide resilience to rising sea levels. BCDC rules still require maximum feasible public access consistent with any project on the piers that the Port of San Francisco proposes.

“A vibrant, 21st century waterfront is a key part of our city’s economy,” said **San Francisco Supervisor and BCDC Commissioner Matt Dorsey.** “This exciting new chapter for the waterfront preserves public access, provides new opportunities for sea level rise education, and allows for flexibility to reimagine Fisherman’s Wharf”

“Fisherman’s Wharf’s aging infrastructure and facilities are in urgent need of investment,” said **Port of San Francisco Executive Director Elaine Forbes**. “The Port supports the new rules which will enable more flexible development to support a resilient Fisherman’s Wharf and working waterfront.” 

**About the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission:** BCDC is a California state agency dedicated to the protection, enhancement and responsible use of the San Francisco Bay. BCDC protects and enhances San Francisco Bay and advances the Bay’s responsible, productive, and equitable uses for this and future generations as we face a changing climate and rising sea levels.
