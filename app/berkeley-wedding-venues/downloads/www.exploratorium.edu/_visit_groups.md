During Your Visit

##### How will I know what’s going on the day that I visit?

Check out the digital monitor in the Crossroads (past Ticketing). Our staff throughout the museum can also tell you if there are any special programs going on that you shouldn’t miss.

##### The Exploratorium is a big museum; how will I know where everything is?

[Download a digital map to orient yourself ](/visit#map)or pick up a printed map on arrival. Our 700+ exhibits and artworks are organized into [6 galleries](/visit/galleries "Museum Galleries"), each focused on different topics. You can visit the galleries in any order you choose; just pick an area of interest and dive in.

##### How long will it take to see everything?

That depends on how much time you spend at each exhibit. We recommend allowing at least two hours to explore.

##### What if I have a question while I’m exploring?

Our staff (in the bright orange vests) are here to help. You can find them throughout the museum and at our Explainer Demo Stations. Ask a question or just see what they’re up to.

##### What if we get hungry or need a break?

  * There are restrooms, water fountains, and lots of places to sit and relax throughout the museum. 
  * [The Tinkering Table Restaurant](/visit/restaurant-cafe "Restaurant & Café") offers a wide range of locally sourced, sustainable food and beverages; however, the restaurant is not set up for large groups. 
  * Groups may bring lunches to eat in the outdoor ticketed space. 
  * Boxed lunches can be purchased in advance by sending an email to [nicolette.bonilla@constellationculinary.com](mailto:nicolette.bonilla@constellationculinary.com)



Learning Support

##### How can we get the most out of our visit?

You might consider coming for a preview visit before you bring your group. If that’s not possible, here are some suggestions for navigating the museum once your group arrives. 

  * **Connect Ideas:** Choose an exhibit to explore. Think about what you learned when you interacted with it. Now, look around and find two more exhibits that have some connection to the first one you chose. What’s the connection? As you explore the rest of the museum, look for other exhibits with connections as well. 
  * **Look for Natural Phenomena:** Seek out exhibits that demonstrate phenomena you’ve noticed in the natural world. Where else have you noticed these phenomena, and under what conditions? 
  * **Use Your Senses:** Find exhibits that involve your sense of smell, touch, sight, and hearing; find at least two for each of these senses. What did you discover about each sense by exploring the exhibits?



##### Need more support reaching your learning goals?

##### Can we get reduced or free group tickets?
