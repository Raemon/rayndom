Sound Bite

Listen with your bones.

Bite down on a straw and listen to music that only you can hear, as sound travels to your inner ear via your teeth and bones. 

Electronic Listening | Michael Chorost

What’s going on?

Ordinarily, you hear sounds when vibrations traveling through the air get captured by the outer ear (or _pinna_) and sent to the inner ear (or _cochlea_), where they are transformed into nerve impulses and sent to the brain.

Here, sound waves from a vibrating rod travel directly to your inner ear via _bone conduction_ —sound vibrations travel through your teeth and bones when you bite down on the rod.

Sound travels much more efficiently through solids than through air. A person biting the rod can hear music loud and clear, others standing nearby don’t hear a thing.

This early hearing aid, called a Dentaphone, worked by bone conduction; using it required biting down on a sheet of hardened rubber. Some modern hearing aids still rely on bone conduction—but through the skull, not the teeth. Photo courtesy of Becker Medical Library, Washington University School of Medicine.
