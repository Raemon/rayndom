Benham's Disk

The colors you see here are all in your head.

When the disk is spun, the colors you see are illusions—they’re called subjective colors because they only exist inside your head. Researchers don’t know exactly how, but these rapidly changing black-and-white patterns cause the color-sensitive cells in your eyes to respond as if you’re looking at objects with “real” color. This effect was popularized in 1894 by toymaker C. E. Benham, who called his spinning disk an “artificial spectrum top."
