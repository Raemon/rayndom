#### Bring a bit of the Exploratorium home with you!

Our store is **inspired by our on-site exhibit workshop** , where exhibits are designed and built in full view on the museum floor.

We carry **unique gadgets** , **games** , **tinkering tools** , **kits** , and **books** that explore science, art, and technology. You’ll find something for both kids and adults—from clever **holiday and birthday gifts** to unusual **San Francisco souvenirs**. We also offer Exploratorium clothing and gift items made by local artisans as well as pieces designed in-house.

Every purchase supports the Exploratorium’s educational mission. [Learn more →](/about-us "About Us")
