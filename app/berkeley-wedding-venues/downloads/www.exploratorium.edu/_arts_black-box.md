# Black Box

![A futuristic and colorful scene with neon lights, silhouettes of people, and a dynamic, illuminated environment.](/sites/default/files/styles/responsive_200w/public/2024-05/black-box-marquee.jpg.webp?itok=aacJFJjf)

Black Box

This 800-square-foot gallery space provides an ideal environment for media art installations.

A place for presenting artwork that inspires and astounds in mysterious and wondrous ways, the Black Box is a darkened 800-square-foot space that provides an ideal environment for media art installations. A commonly used metaphor in science and engineering, a  _black box_ describes something that has observable inputs and outputs and unseen inner workings. Something goes in and something comes out, but the process by which transformation occurs is “black” or unknown to the observer. At the Exploratorium, the black box concept has been combined with our focus on the [Arts](https://www.exploratorium.edu/arts) as a way of knowing through exploration, inquiry, and discovery.

Drawing on the Exploratorium’s unique province as a hybrid museum presenting and developing artworks at the juncture of art, science, and technology, the Black Box features dynamic, innovative multimedia exhibitions to prompt curiosity and transformation.

She heard the sound of the humming typewriter transferred through the wooden table via the contact points of her elbows. The sound vibration traveled by bone conduction through her arms and into her inner ear.

Viewed from a distance, each pinpoint of light seems to be in orbit around another, evocative of galaxies rotating and twisting as they sweep through space. But viewed from below, the lights fill our field of vision and transform into unpredictable 3D patterns dancing overhead. A score by Jonathan Crawford accompanies _Entangled Attraction_.
