# Museum Galleries

![Galleries](/sites/default/files/styles/responsive_200w/public/2023-03/visit_galleries_marquee.jpg.webp?itok=CYVRyyS0)

Museum Galleries

The Exploratorium has six main galleries, each focused on a different area of exploration.

Common to all of the Exploratorium's six main galleries are interactive exhibits that reward your attention and give you much to think about. Indulge your curiosity and ask your own questions as you play with the exhibits, and discover new ways to understand how our world works.

The galleries share the floor with our [Exhibit Development Workshop](https://live-explo.pantheonsite.io/exhibits/exhibit-making), where our exhibits are researched, developed, and fabricated.
