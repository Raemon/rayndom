Bay Windows

Compare how gravel, sand, and fine silt settle out of swirling waters.

Five clear, rotating disks provide beautiful windows into the motion of sediments in the Bay. Spin them to compare the behavior of gravel, sand, and fine silt—how the currents carry them and how they settle out of the swirling waters.
