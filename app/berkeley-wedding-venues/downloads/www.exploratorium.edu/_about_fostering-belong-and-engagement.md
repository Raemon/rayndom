# Fostering Belonging and Engagement

Fostering Belonging and Engagement

Creating inclusive experiences that empower everyone to learn, question, and connect.

## Why is the Exploratorium doing this work?

The Exploratorium began with Frank Oppenheimer’s vision of empowering **people as learners** through **hands-on science experiences**. Today we continue to lead a movement to make **phenomenal learning experiences accessible** and relevant to everyone, everywhere—to create a world where everyone can think for themselves, confidently ask questions, question answers, and understand the world around them.

Yet even in the United States—one of the world’s wealthiest nations—we find widespread gaps in access to science learning opportunities.

If we hope to make STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and math) accessible to everyone, we must embrace the principles of **fair and unbiased treatment for all** , and welcome and value a **diversity of ideas, skills, perspectives, and backgrounds**.

The Exploratorium is working to become a **truly inclusive institution** that reflects and responds to the interests, aspirations, needs, and stories of all our staff, audiences, collaborators, and communities.

## What is the Exploratorium doing?

We are continually evolving and improving our approaches to creating engaging programs, policies, and opportunities for both audiences and staff.

###### For our audiences and communities, we are:

  * Developing programs, exhibits, and experiences that appeal to and embrace a broader array of audiences, including those underrepresented in STEM learning spaces.
  * Increasing access to our learning resources for members of non-English speaking communities by translating more of our offerings into Spanish and Chinese.
  * Developing relationships and partnerships with people and organizations from communities that are underrepresented in our audiences.
  * Collaborating and co-creating exhibitions, programs, and other projects with these partners.



###### For our staff, we are fostering a culture of belonging for all by:

  * Promoting fair and unbiased access to leadership development opportunities
  * Evolving our policies and practices to create a culture where everyone can thrive
  * Increasing transparency and communication across the organization
  * Seeking, where appropriate, greater input to inform and advance the decision-making processes
  * Increasing employee retention and satisfaction
