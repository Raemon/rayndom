Phenomenal Ball

An Evening of Science and Surprise

We are excited to announce that the Phenomenal Ball will return to the Exploratorium on **Friday, May 1, 2026**!

Join us for a phenomenal night of science, art, and surprise! Our spring fundraiser raises over $1M in support of our Exhibit Development Shop, which creates signature hands on exhibits energizing public spaces from San Francisco to Singapore.

Mark your calendar for the fabulous Phenomenal Ball and exclusive new After-Party. Enjoy a playful, inspiring evening of cocktails, dinner, dancing, and discovering our hundreds of hands-on exhibits—all while celebrating the Exploratorium’s mission to create inquiry-based experiences that transform science learning worldwide.

Save the date—it will be a night to engage your senses and feed your curiosity!
