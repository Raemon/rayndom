#### Happiness & Gratitude Generously Sponsored by YOU

> “It brings me joy to be able to offer a membership to the families we serve. Many families don’t have opportunities to access these programs. Families have been thankful that they have the opportunity for planned activities that are provided by a visit to the Exploratorium.”

—Myrna Little, _Support for Families of Children with Disabilities_

> “Offering a free annual family membership to families is a great opportunity for parents to develop and increase parent interaction and time with their children. I bring families from the Parent Action Grant and the children love it!!!”

—Fiona Yuen, _APA Family Support Services_

> “A lot of our families do not have access and have never been to the Exploratorium or other popular SF attractions due money. This allows them the opportunity to get to experience new things.”

—Rachelle Butler, _PIT YMCA_

> “This is a great opportunity to make access equitable for all families. It is wonderful to offer something that allows the families to bond and learn in a fun and magical environment.”

—Anastasia Gordon, _Bayview YMCA_

> “Often families struggling with housing/financial hardships don’t get to participate in activities to bring them joy and creativity. Having those moments help them refill their joy and resilience bucket!”

—Jadma Dudez, _La Raza Community Resource Center_

> “For me, it means access. Providing families access to activities that they might not have because of income/financial barriers. [This annual family membership] gives families the opportunity to learn and bond. Access and opportunity to communities that often feel unseen.”

—Natasha Matthews, _OMI YMCA_
