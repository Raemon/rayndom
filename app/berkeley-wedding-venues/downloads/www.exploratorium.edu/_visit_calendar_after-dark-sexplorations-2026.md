After Dark: Sexplorations

**Looking for a hot night out on the town?** Slip into something comfortable and take an intimate look at sex—you know, the transfer of genetic information through sperm and eggs. From the mating rituals of insects to the naughty bits of flowers, learn about the varied and creative ways in which the natural world gets it on. Tell a story about how you behave in the (spread)sheets by making a graph about your sex life with the Graphic Sex Project. Explore the history of pleasure with vintage vibrators and slide into the science of pole dancing with a tantalizing and educational performance.

Because sometimes science can be sexy!

__Demo at 8 p.m.; Performance at 9 p.m.

__Bechtel Gallery 3

###### With Sanjay Makhijani, Joshuah Ciafardone, and Sade Symone

Physics, anatomy, and a bit of “chemistry” are all in action during a successful pole routine. Learn about the incredible forces at play and amazing muscular control required to spin, climb, and slide on a 2” shaft, all while keeping it erect. Because sometimes science can be sexy!

##### Nerd Nite: Nature Gone Wild

Learn about the queerness of nature, lizard mating, and weird bug sex.

__8:30 p.m.

__Osher Gallery 1, Kanbar Forum

###### With Nerd Nite SF

Enjoy three talks about just a few of the wild ways nature approaches reproduction.

**There Is No Binary: The Infinite Queerness of Nature**  
**With David Faulkner**  
You may have grown up learning that sexual reproduction is straightforward: females + males = babies. Nature, however, abhors a binary, and the actual biological facts of sex are way more complicated! Who says that one organism can't have multiple flavors of sex organ, switch back and forth between sexes, or can only have two sexes—when they can have thousands?

**David Faulkner, PhD** works for the California EPA cleaning up old military bases. As a co-host of [Nerd Nite SF,](https://www.instagram.com/nerdnitesf/?hl=en) David is no stranger to fascinating science stories.

**Love Is a Double-Edged Sword: The Ins and Outs of Lizard Mating**  
**With Chelsea Connor**  
Mating is vital for survival, and lizards have found the most effective ways to make sure they pass their genes on. With the use of cloning, double-headed appendages, and lots of push-ups and biting, explore how lizards have evolved to find love with or without finding an actual mate.

**Chelsea Connor** is a herpetologist, birder, and artist. She is the co-founder of Black Birders Week, a 2024 Golden Gate Bird Alliance Birding for Everyone Fellow, and a co-host of Nerd Nite SF.

**Freak in the Sheets: Bed Bugs and Weird Bug Sex**  
**With Nicole Parra**  
Insects and other invertebrates have some of the most bewildering and unique reproductive strategies in the animal kingdom. From cannibalism to nuptial gifts, learn about their elaborate and unusual courtship behaviors. Hopefully they don’t inspire your next session in the bedroom.

**Nicole Parra** is a naturalist and artist who is passionate about bugs and other weird critters. She is the founder and full-time artist behind [Fossil Forager,](http://instagram.com/fossil.forager/?hl=en) an ongoing illustration project that aims to highlight the biodiversity of life on our planet and create nature-themed goods for all.

##### Love Nest

Check out our milkweed bugs’ love nest and see how they get it on.

__6:00–10:00 p.m.

__Moore Gallery 4

Milkweed bugs can get it on for hours on end, literally; they mate by sticking their back ends together. Scientists think their stamina stems from competition: a male doesn’t want another bug’s sperm to outdo its own. Come check out our milkweed bugs’ love nest and see how it’s done, so to speak.

##### Shark, Shark, Baby: An Elasmobranch Anatomy Show-and-Tell

See how elasmobranch fishes do it and view unique preserved specimens.

__6:30, 7:30, and 8:30 p.m.

__Moore Gallery 4, Explainer Station

###### With Lindsay Harris

Have you ever wondered what that elongated, oddly familiar fin on the underside of a shark is? Chat with Exploratorium biologist Lindsay Harris about the different ways elasmobranch fishes (sharks, skates, and rays) get it on, and the parts that make it possible—complete with unique preserved specimens provided by shark biologists from around the country.

##### Peek Inside: Cervix Viewing Laboratory

Be both scientist and test subject.

__6:30–9:00 p.m.

__Gallery 2

###### With Liz Donnelly and the Beautiful Cervix Project

Our own bodies can be delightful subjects for observation, exploration, and data collection. Be both scientist and test subject (or invite a partner): learn how to observe a cervix, how this organ changes in response to the menstrual cycle's hormones, and how these observations can help prevent or achieve pregnancy.

Whether you’re the proud owner of a cervix or know someone willing to show theirs off, you can see this incredible organ at home with the help of a speculum and a hand mirror! Grab a take-home cervix viewing kit, and learn from midwife Liz Donnelly and postpartum doula O’Nell Starkey about how to use it. Plus, view images of different cervices curated by the Beautiful Cervix Project, and see and feel how cervical fluid changes across the menstrual cycle by touching imitation fluid.

**Liz Donnelly** is a midwife. She is passionate about supporting folks to learn about and feel empowered in their bodies.

**O’Nell Starkey** is a postpartum doula, ceremonialist, artist and the creatrix of the Beautiful Cervix Project. Her website empowers people to learn about their intimate anatomy through cervical self-exam and features a diverse gallery of cervical selfies.

##### The Graphic Sex Project

Create a graph of your desires to share with a partner to spark conversation.

__6:00–9:30 p.m.

__Osher Gallery 1

###### With Jen Beman, Biograffs

What does “good sex” mean to you? Explore our gallery of how 200+ people have used colored cubes to graph their answers to that question. It's a playful, data-driven display of pleasure and preferences. Create a graph of your own desires to share with a partner and spark a revealing conversation. Add your graph to the collection to become part of an ever-expanding display of the wondrous diversity of the human sexual experience. It's an analog intimacy interface that’s part art installation and part social experiment, plus data you can take to bed.

  
The **Graphic Sex Project** is a traveling interactive art experience created by **Jennifer Beman** to offer people a way to open up conversations with partners about sex, and to better appreciate the diversity and commonality of human sexual activity. There is also home version called [BioGraffs](https://www.instagram.com/bio.graffs/)—a creative, hands-on exercise for talking about things that are hard to talk about. Both projects grew out of Beman's insights from a 40 year career as a documentary film editor: visual storytelling can bypass language, reveal complexity, and create powerful moments of human understanding.
