# Teacher Institute Research

Teacher Institute Research

In the Teacher Institute, research focuses on how and what science teachers learn across a variety of professional development opportunities provided at the museum. We use a mixture of quantitative and qualitative research methods to comprehend changes in science teachers’ understanding of content, pedagogical practices, and beliefs about science teaching and learning. Results from research are used internally by the Teacher Institute staff to improve professional learning opportunities for secondary science teachers, and are disseminated through peer-reviewed journals and presentations at national research conferences.
