# Artist-in-Residence Program

Artist-in-Residence Program

Since its inception in 1974, the Exploratorium’s Artist-in-Residence Program (AIR) has grown to include hundreds of artists and performers.

The museum works with individuals and artist groups who are drawn to collaboration, interested in interdisciplinary dialogue, and open to developing new working methods. Projects have taken countless forms, such as multimedia performances, theatrical productions, animated filmmaking, immersive installations, walking tours, and online projects. 

The program allows artists to embed within the unique culture of the institution, affords access to a dynamic and distinct staff, and provides opportunities for cross-pollination with a diverse public. While the museum allows room for variance, residencies typically unfold over two years and include both an exploratory and project-development phase. 

The AIR program is an opportunity for artists to begin their residency with a sense of curiosity and experimentation rather than a fully formed idea and to work in a co-creative manner with the Exploratorium. 

Applicants to the program should be inherently curious and deeply invested in inquiry as a part of their practice. Exploratorium AIRs receive a $15,000 annual stipend, support for travel, project management and financial support for residency projects, and access to Exploratorium facilities and staff expertise.

**Applications are now closed for the 2025 Open Call for Artist in Residence.**
