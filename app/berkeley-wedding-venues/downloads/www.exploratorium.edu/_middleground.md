Middle Ground

Reconsidering ourselves and others

People of all ages are invited to pull up a chair and experience Middle Ground, an exciting outdoor exhibition about how people interact with one another.

Location: San Francisco Main Library, Fulton Street steps

Running: July 2023 through March 2024

Whether you’re a denizen of the densest urban metropolis or the smallest small town, no person is an island. What goes into the stories we tell ourselves about other people—whether they’re on the streets we share, in our memories and our newsfeeds, or on the other side of the world?

Social scientists have studied how we think, feel, and behave in relation to other people for decades. Their investigations have shed light on bias and stereotyping, humor and generosity, how we work together, and how we pull apart into tribes.

Middle Ground explores these topics while giving people a chance to connect with others and experience directly the human phenomenon of the exhibition. It will be available free to all comers at the library for eight months, at which point it will travel to another location in San Francisco. Thank you to our partners at the San Francisco Public Library!

Middle Ground was made possible by grants from the National Science Foundation (awards #1713638 and #2116110).
