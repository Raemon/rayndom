Laura Zander is a strategic, results-driven executive with deep expertise in financial leadership, operations, and organizational effectiveness. With a career spanning the international development, corporate, and nonprofit sectors, she brings a rare blend of business acumen, cross-sector experience, and visionary leadership. 

Since joining the Exploratorium in 2007, Laura has devoted herself to shaping one of the world's most innovative museums. After 18 years as Chief Financial Officer, she now leads the organization's growth strategy, forging partnerships across government and private sectors to expand the Exploratorium's global reach and monetize its world-class intellectual property. As Chief Operating Officer, she oversees a comprehensive portfolio encompassing facilities and real estate, information technology, venue rentals and concessions, public-private partnerships, and sustainability initiatives. 

Laura was instrumental in the museum’s $300 million relocation and LEED Platinum-certified rehabilitation of Pier 15, and she negotiated more than $200 million in complex financing structures to enable the Exploratorium’s move to the San Francisco waterfront. 

Her leadership has earned significant recognition: CFO of the Year (2024) and Most Influential Women in Bay Area Business (2013) by the San Francisco Business Times, and selection for the Harvard Business School W50 (2014), which honors 50 outstanding alumnae for exceptional leadership and impact. 

A native of Caracas, Venezuela, Laura brings a global perspective to her work. She is fluent in Spanish and conversant in Italian and French. She earned her MBA from Harvard Business School and BA in English from Columbia University. Her favorite pastime is walking through cities and cherishes her daily walk to work with her dog, Juno.
