Osher Fellows

The Osher fellowship program brings artists, thinkers, and scientists with wide-ranging backgrounds and multidisciplinary interests.

We bring outstanding artists, scholars, authors, and scientists to the museum as Osher Fellows through the generosity of the Bernard Osher Foundation. Osher Fellows work with Exploratorium staff on programs, exhibit projects, and new endeavors, and share their own research and work with staff and the public. These thinker-in-residence fellowships are generally one to four weeks in duration.

The perspectives and backgrounds of our Osher Fellows are wide-ranging and reflect the Exploratorium’s multidisciplinary interests. Previous Fellows include [Oliver Sacks](/collaborations/oshers/oliver-sacks "Oliver Sacks: Osher Fellows"), who helped in the planning of exhibits about memory; [Richard Gregory](/collaborations/oshers/richard-gregory "Richard Gregory: Osher Fellows"), who worked with us on visual perception exhibits; photographer [Rosamond Wolff Purcell](/collaborations/oshers/rosamond-wolff-purcell "Rosamond Wolff Purcell: Osher Fellows"), who provided guidance for the temporary exhibition Revealing Bodies; and [Edith Ackermann](/collaborations/oshers/edith-ackermann "Edith Ackermann: Osher Fellows"), visiting scientist at MIT’s School of Architecture, who shared design principles of interactive learning.
