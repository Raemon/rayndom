Glow Cinema

Presented by Cinema Arts

In celebration of _Glow_ , immerse yourself in five short films that further the interplay of the arts and sciences while capturing luminous color in both rural and urban landscapes. A little robot is brought to life, and the tactile materials of industry are also captured in playful and radiant ways!

Running time: 25 minutes on a loop

 _I AM GLITCHING_ by Salma Parra (2024, 7 min.)  
_Reflection_ by Sylvie Trouvé (2012, 4 min.)   
 _Attraction_ by Emily Scaife (2019, 5 min.)   
 _Con Brio_ by Sandra Eber (2013, 4 min.)
