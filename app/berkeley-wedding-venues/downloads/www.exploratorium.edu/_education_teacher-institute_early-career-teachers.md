Early Career Science Teacher Program

The Early Career Science Teacher Program is a two-year opportunity for San Francisco Bay Area secondary science teachers (grades 6–12) who will be entering their 3rd, 4th, or 5th year of teaching at the start of next school year. 

  
This program is designed to support teachers at a key stage in their careers—when early-career supports may taper off, but the chance to deepen expertise and refine teaching practices is vital. Together, we focus on phenomenon-based teaching, engaging all students, and creating equitable classroom environments.

  
If you’re dedicated to making science accessible and meaningful for every student, this program offers a space to grow and strengthen your practice, and provides a bridge to leadership for those interested in pursuing such roles.
