STARS

Striving for Trans Inclusion and Anti-Racism in Science Learning at the Exploratorium

## Program Overview

The vision of the STARS program (2020-2023) was to expand inclusion, belonging, and relevance in informal science learning with a focus on addressing inequities based on gender, sexuality, and race. STARS’ innovative educational offerings provided Exploratorium audiences with experiences that centered excluded identities in STEAM and education fields. The STARS team, which was comprised of select members of our Explainer team, also developed special add-on learning interventions for Field Trip groups, Explainer demonstrations, and other offerings. 

Striving for Trans Inclusion and Anti-Racism in Science Learning was funded by General Motors.
