What We Do

From new exhibits about geometry and personal finance, to galleries that feature mind-opening artworks, our projects reach millions of visitors around the world. Through design, fabrication, and professional development, we share our deep experience making exhibits and creating programs—shaping and tailoring our approach and knowledge to the needs and goals of your community.

How We Do It 

We co-create programs, conduct research, and train staff; we think across disciplines, collaborate, and prototype. Our collaborations range in scope from consultations in museum planning to designing, developing, and creating all the exhibitions and program plans for a new science center.
