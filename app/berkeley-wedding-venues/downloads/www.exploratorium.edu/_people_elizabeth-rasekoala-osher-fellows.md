Dr. Elizabeth Rasekoala is the President of [African Gong: The Pan-African Network for the Popularization of Science & Technology and Science Communication.](https://www.africangong.org/) She is a veteran science communication scholar and practitioner based in South Africa, and the editor of the influential new book, [_Race and Sociocultural Inclusion in Science Communication: Innovation, Decolonisation, and Transformation_.](https://bristoluniversitypress.co.uk/race-and-socio-cultural-inclusion-in-science-communication) Thirty diverse practitioners and academics from across the Global South and North contributed empowering ideas and transformative concepts about inclusive science communication. [The book has received special recognition from the CIMUSET Award Committee.](https://cimuset.mini.icom.museum/book-on-race-and-inclusion-in-science-communication-receives-special-recognition-from-cimuset-award-committee/)  
  
Elizabeth is the 2019 recipient of the International NAT AWARD for Science Communication, conferred by the Natural Science Museum of Barcelona. She is ambitious in seeking to harness mutual learning, equity, and decolonization approaches across the Global North-South divide. This will encourage science communicators across these regions to work together to deliver a transformed, inclusive science communication landscape, one that fully embraces globally inclusive knowledge paradigms and diverse knowledge-sharing practices that engender public trust in science.
