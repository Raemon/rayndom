Angela Yuen, 2025

The Dreamer IV

This delicate kinetic sculpture showcases a collection of manufactured goods the artist amassed over a decade. The piece includes plastic toys made in Hong Kong, beads, acrylic sheets, LED lights, resin, and a motor. Every object is carefully choreographed to combine multiple colored shadows that produce unexpected results. This rotating light sculpture projects silhouettes onto the wall, casting vivid shadows that evoke the changing landscapes of Hong Kong.

About the Artist

Hong Kong–based artist Angela Yuen has long been fascinated with all things local. Her art practice and creative process focus on urban culture and the theme “neighborhood.” She collects ready-made objects that she remembers from her youth to serve as an iconic representation of Hong Kong’s manufacturing boom that shaped the early stages of its modernization.
