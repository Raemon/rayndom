Anne’s role focuses on research, development, and production strategies for content across Pier 15 and global museums, starting with the design of world-class experiences at home. As we reimagine Piers 15 and 17, her teams will develop the next generation of exhibits and programs for our floor as well as the intellectual property that will drive future business around the world. Anne oversees our Environment, Exhibits, Public Programs, Sciences, and Visitor Research & Evaluation teams, in addition to our Global Collaborations team. 

Since joining the Exploratorium, Anne has proven her strong creative, business, and pedagogical acumen across teams, departments, and now continents. After serving in several roles in informal learning in Chicago and Boston, she began working at the Exploratorium in 2003 as the assistant manager for school field trips and director of our summer camp program. Anne guided the Field Trip Explainer Program for a decade while also completing her doctoral dissertation on science-learner identity development in a community of practice in 2011. In 2013, she launched and directed Helix, a one-year pop-up community science center in Los Altos run by the Exploratorium. She has served in leadership roles for Global Collaborations, most recently as Chief Global Officer, working closely with partners worldwide and their communities to create museums that are Exploratorium-inspired, locally rooted, and achieve shared goals for impact.
