Uroborus

This "tail-devourer" symbolizes an eternal loop.

A motorized serpent’s tail repeatedly strikes a snake-headed switch,triggering a never-ending mechanical loop. There are a number ofinterpretations of the ancient uroborus snake symbol (also spelled _ouroboros_ and  _uroboros_).  
  
In an effort to preserve a style that had become the hallmark of theExploratorium’s pioneer days, elements of the Uroborus had been scavenged from an older, discarded Exploratorium exhibit.
