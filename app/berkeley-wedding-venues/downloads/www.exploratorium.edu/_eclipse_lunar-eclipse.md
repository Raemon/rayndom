What Is a Lunar Eclipse?

#### 

#### During a lunar eclipse, Earth blocks the Sun’s light and casts a shadow on the moon.

A lunar eclipse happens when Earth is directly between the moon and Sun. Earth blocks the light coming from the Sun, casting a shadow on the moon. The shadow makes the moon appear much dimmer and sometimes turns the lunar surface a striking red. The moon appears red because the light that is illuminating it must pass through Earth’s atmosphere, which scatters blue light and bends (or refracts) red light toward the moon.

The intensity of the red color is determined by where the moon is in Earth’s shadow. The moon appears deep red when it’s in the darkest part of the shadow, called the _umbra,_ and has a light red tint if it is in the partial shadow, or _penumbra_.

###### Quick facts about lunar eclipses:

  * Lunar eclipses only happen at night. 
  * If you were standing on the moon, Earth would block your view of the Sun.
  * On average, there are three lunar eclipses every year. 
  * The moon is at its maximum eclipse for approximately 30 minutes to an hour.
  * Each lunar eclipse is visible from half of Earth, or anywhere where the moon is above the horizon.
  * It is safe to look directly at lunar eclipses—no special glasses required!
