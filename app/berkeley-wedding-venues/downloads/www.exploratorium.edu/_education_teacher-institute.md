Teacher Institute

Hands-on, inquiry-rich experiences for secondary science and math teachers 

## A Professional Home for Science Teachers

* * *

The Exploratorium Teacher Institute has been the professional development home for middle school and high school math and science teachers since 1984. 

Our mission is to create and support a collaborative community of teachers, at all levels of their careers, through professional development that joyfully emphasizes the teaching and learning of science as a process for understanding the world around us. 

Each year, more than a thousand teachers attend workshops and programs designed to provide opportunities for them to ask questions as learners, share expertise as practitioners, and develop as leaders. 

We offer professional learning opportunities for both new and experienced teachers and teacher leaders. All program participants are provided with stipends for attending our institutes and workshops.

## Summer Institute

If you are a middle school or high school science teacher with at least three years of teaching experience, consider attending our Summer Institute and immerse yourself in the Exploratorium’s philosophy of inquiry-rich, hands-on teaching. Engage with phenomena using science and engineering practices, build small versions of Exploratorium exhibits for your class, and join a community of educators dedicated to employing the best practices in experiential science education.

If you have previously attended a Summer Institute, then you are a Teacher Institute alumnus. We offer various workshops for alumni during the summer and on Saturdays during the academic year. More information is available on the [Alumni web page](/education/teacher-institute/alumni "Teacher Institute Alumni Page")

## Early Career Science Teachers

* * *

The Early Career Science Teacher program is a two-year opportunity for Bay Area secondary science teachers with 2 to 3 years of classroom experience. This program is designed to support teachers at a key stage in their careers—when early-career supports may taper off, but the chance to deepen expertise and refine teaching practices is vital.

## Teacher Leadership Program

* * *

Are you interested in mentoring or coaching novice teachers? The Teacher Leadership Program is a two-year initiative that trains experienced science teachers in the art of coaching and mentoring those in the early years of their career. Research shows that supporting less experienced teachers to develop their craft increases the likelihood that they will remain in the profession.
