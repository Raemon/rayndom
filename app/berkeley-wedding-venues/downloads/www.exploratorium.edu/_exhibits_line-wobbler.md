Line Wobbler

Control a green pixel while battling enemies, lava, and force fields. Can you make it through all nine levels?

Both of these one-dimensional dungeon crawlers run on an Arduino, and have a custom controller—or _wobbler_ —made of a spring that moves your pixel along, and an LED strip, which allows for flexibility in the design. The wobbler provides tactile feedback and lets you bend the spring to move forward or backward, and fling it to attack. The sound effects are controlled by the acceleration of the wobbler.
