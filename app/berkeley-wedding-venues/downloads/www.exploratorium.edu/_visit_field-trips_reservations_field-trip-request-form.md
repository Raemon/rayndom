# Field Trip Request Form

# Book a Field Trip

Thank you for your interest in visiting the Exploratorium with your field trip group. Please complete the form below. You’ll be contacted by reservations staff to finalize the details of your visit. 

**Please let us know if you teach in a Title I school.** Title I schools receive free admission for school field trips, subject to availability. Please ask about this program when you make your reservation. 

**For all non-Title I schools** , a deposit of 50% of the total amount is due 1 month prior to your visit. This deposit will be applied to your total amount due, which must be paid in full on arrival or sooner and may be made by credit card or check. Deposits are nonrefundable if a reservation is canceled less than two weeks before the reserved arrival date. No refunds of under $50 will be issued. 

Please note that there is **free admission for aides** accompanying field trip students with disabilities.
