Field Trip Admission and Tickets

Find out how much field trips cost—and some ways we're making the Exploratorium accessible for all.

## Free Admission

We want the Exploratorium to be accessible for everyone. Here are some ways you can visit the Exploratorium without paying anything at all:

#### Free Visits for Teachers

At the Exploratorium, we support teachers. Here are a few ways teachers can visit the museum for free:

  * If you’re the lead teacher on a field trip that's already been scheduled, you can preview the museum for free before the date of the trip. When you arrive, tell Guest Services that you are preparing for an upcoming field trip. Show a copy of the confirmation e-mail you received from us, and we’ll sign you in free of charge. For more information, call 415.528.4444.
  * [**Apply here**](/visit/reduced-rates#teachers "Free and Reduced Admission") for our program offering free Exploratorium admission for all California public school K–12 teachers.



#### Free Admission for Title I Schools

Title I schools receive free admission for school field trips. Ask about this program when you make your reservation.

##  Field Trip Prices

Prices are for Tuesday through Friday visits. The 2024-2025 field trip season is September 10, 2024-June 6, 2025.

Youth (Grades K–12)| $10.00  
---|---  
Children (3 or younger)| Free  
Teachers/Adults| 1 admitted free per 10 youth  
Additional Adults| $10.00  
[Members](/membership "Membership")| While members receive complimentary year-round general admission, these admission privileges do not extend to the field trip program, which is separately funded. Please include any members in your overall head count.  
Title I Schools| Title I schools receive free admission for school field trips, subject to availability. Please ask about this program when you make your reservation.   
  
#### Paying for your field trip

We accept the following forms of payment for group and field trip reservations: checks, MasterCard, VISA, Discover, and American Express.

A deposit of 50% of the total amount is due on the 1st of the month prior to the date of your intended visit. This deposit will be applied to your total amount due, which must be paid in full on arrival or sooner. Deposits are nonrefundable if a reservation is canceled within two weeks of the intended arrival date. No refunds of under $50 will be issued.

Apart from the deposit, payment must be made in one lump sum even if you're paying for several classes. If you would like to pay separately for different classes, please make separate reservations. Group members paying separately are not eligible for group pricing and will be charged general admission rates.

Please have ready an exact head count—the total number of youth (grades K–12), children (5 or younger), and adults in your entire group.
