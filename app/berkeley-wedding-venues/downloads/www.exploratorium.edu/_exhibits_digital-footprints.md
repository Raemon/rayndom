Digital Footprints

Daily cycles of the city are projected onto a miniature topographic map of San Francisco.

Daily cycles of the city are projected onto a miniature topographic map of San Francisco: the movement of city buses and trains, local-area photos posted to Flickr and geographically located posts sent out via Twitter. This ever-changing data visualization "reads" the activity patterns reflected in social media and reveals how those are shaped by transportation, land use, and urban design.
