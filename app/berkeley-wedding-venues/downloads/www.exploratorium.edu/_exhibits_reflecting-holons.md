Creator

Martens & Visser, 2015

Reflecting Holons

These ever-changing, shimmering sculptures reflect and refract surrounding light in all the colors of the rainbow. Made from long, delicate strips of iridescent foil attached to a rotating metallic axis, the Holons twist and turn as motors spin them. This movement creates soap bubble forms that lie somewhere between the physical and the ethereal. Their hypnotic rhythm invites you to keep watching as the lights and forms continuously shift.
