Creator

Maja Petrić, 2025

Star-Filled Void

This interactive light installation lets each human silhouette become part of a living constellation. As visitors move, sensors capture their outlines and custom software transforms them into glowing constellation projections. The work invites us to see ourselves not in isolation, but as luminous participants in a shared, infinite cosmos.
