# Cells to Self

![Cells to Self](/sites/default/files/styles/responsive_200w/public/2023-06/Cells-Webbnr-1200x380_jv.png.webp?itok=4A018ZHy)

Cells to Self

Exploring the Life Inside You

How do the trillions of cells in your body work together to create a human self? How are you shaped by the genes you’re born with, and by your environment?

Through more than 20 new experiences, this collection reveals the wondrous variety of human cells, and the amazing things they’re doing in your body. See live heart cells beating in time with your own pulse, or find out which bacteria are living on your skin. Through living tissues, microscopes, and digital models, you’ll discover how cells move and communicate. And consider how genetic and environmental forces create your uniquely human self.
