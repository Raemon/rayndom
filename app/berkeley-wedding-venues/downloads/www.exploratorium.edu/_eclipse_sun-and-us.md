# The Sun and Us

# Explore life with our Sun.

### The relationship between the Sun and us ignites wonder—and moves science forward.

Observing the Sun

### We have always observed the Sun.

For astronomers and eclipse watchers in general, a total solar eclipse provides an excellent opportunity to study the Sun in detail. As millions of people travel to witness total solar eclipses across the world, we are reminded that humans have always observed the Sun. Exploratorium astronomer and educator, Dr. Isabel Hawkins, takes us through a brief history of viewing the Sun - from ancient Chinese astronomers using jade disks to look at the Sun to the latest NASA satellite mission to study the Sun, the Parker Solar Probe.

NASA Heliophysics Missions

NASA Heliophysics Missions

To understand Earth, we have to understand the Sun’s impact on the planet we call home. NASA has formed the Science Mission Directorate Heliophysics Division to investigate the nature of our closest star.

Mission to the Sun

Mission to the Sun

The Parker Solar Probe was built to study a very hot spot. Join Eric Christian, NASA research scientist, as he details the objectives of the mission and describes some solar mysteries NASA hopes to solve.
