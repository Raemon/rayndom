Distorted Room

See your friends go from tiny to towering in a few steps.

From one view, this room looks like a normal room, but people and things inside may seem quite strange.

Peer into what looks like a perfectly normal room and you’ll see an astonishing effect straight out of _Alice In Wonderland_ : People seeming to grow and shrink as they wander around the checkered floor of this unusual room.

What’s going on?

What makes the illusion of this special room, called an _Ames room_ , so effective is a carefully chosen vantage point. Viewed from a particular angle, this slanted room looks square, even though the ceiling on one side is actually about twice the height as the other. Since square rooms are the norm in our world, your brain decides the room _is_ square—a decision that causes the people inside to seem to grow and shrink as they move from one side to the other.

[![A diagram showing the visual illusion of the Distorted Room exhibit](/sites/default/files/uploads/DistortedRoom-diagram.jpg)](/sites/default/files/uploads/DistortedRoom-diagram.jpg) This illusion has been used widely to create special effects in movies and television. In _The Lord of the Rings_ , for example, several scenes set in the Shire relied on _Ames rooms_ to make the hobbits look tiny relative to Gandalf. (click diagram to enlarge)
