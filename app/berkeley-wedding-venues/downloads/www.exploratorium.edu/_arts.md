Arts at the Exploratorium

The arts are a fundamental method of discovery at the Exploratorium.

We engage artists in every facet of our work and in a multitude of ways to inspire curiosity and further an interdisciplinary approach to seeing and understanding the world.

From creating long-lasting exhibits on our museum floor to developing unforgettable performances in our public spaces, the Exploratorium has presented the work of hundreds of artists working at the intersection of art, science, and learning.

Artists contribute in countless ways to our ongoing research and development, both on and off the museum floor. In partnership with key staff, many of whom are artists themselves, outside artists explore themes such as human cognition and social behavior, physics and perception, ecologies of place, living systems, and making as thinking.
