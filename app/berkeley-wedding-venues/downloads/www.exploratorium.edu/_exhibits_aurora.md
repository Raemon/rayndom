Aurora

A reflector stretches light from colored tiles into long bright ribbons.

Aurora

_Aurora_ shows how reflections are created both by the shape of the light and the shape of the reflector. The reflector is a large curved sheet of brushed stainless steel. The tiny ridges in the steel act like tiny mirrors, each reflecting an image. When the images from all the ridges add up, they blend into a single, elongated image that looks like a ribbon of light. The many colored tiles with the exhibit let you experiment with both the shape and color of the reflections.
