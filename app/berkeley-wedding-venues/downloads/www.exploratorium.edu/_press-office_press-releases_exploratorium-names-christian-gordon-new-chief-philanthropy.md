**SAN FRANCISCO (October 1, 2025)** –The Exploratorium has appointed Christian Gordon as its new Chief Philanthropy Officer. Gordon will lead the museum’s Institutional Advancement division in support of the Exploratorium’s mission to democratize science learning worldwide.

Gordon brings more than two decades of experience building development programs and campaigns for mission-driven institutions, most recently serving as Assistant Dean of Development for UC Berkeley’s College of Letters & Science. There, he led a turnaround effort to rebuild development and alumni relations for Berkeley Social Sciences as part of the university’s historic _Light the Way_ campaign, which ultimately raised $7.34 billion—the largest total for a public university. He also led the successful campaign for the Simon School of Business during the University of Rochester’s $1.2 billion _Meliora_ campaign.

“Christian’s world-class fundraising experience and service to educational institutions aligns perfectly with our vision and values,” said Lindsay Bierman, Sakurako and William Fisher Executive Director and CEO of the Exploratorium. “His passion and expertise complement and strengthen our accomplished leadership team.”

Gordon began his career in operations for the Los Angeles Kings and Los Angeles Lakers practice facility during the Lakers’ late-90s Three-peat era before moving into higher education fundraising. He holds a BS from Grand Valley State University, a Master’s in Education from Boston University, and a Certificate in Professional Fundraising from BU. Since 2020, he has served on the Board of Advisors of The Hip Hop Museum, scheduled to open in the Bronx in 2026.

From its 220,000-square-foot headquarters at Pier 15, the Exploratorium reaches a global audience and network of science centers, approximately 80% of which have Exploratorium-influenced exhibits and experiences. The Exploratorium is also a professional development home for California’s K-12 science teachers and the largest net-zero energy museum in the U.S.

“Science and education are fundamental cornerstones of a thriving society, and the Exploratorium is uniquely positioned to improve how science is taught and learned for people here in the Bay Area, across the country, and around the world,” Gordon said. “I'm humbled and honored to be joining the Exploratorium, an organization which has enriched the lives of countless people, including my kids.”
