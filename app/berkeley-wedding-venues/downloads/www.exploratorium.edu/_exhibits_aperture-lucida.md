Tristan Duke, 2020

Aperture Lucida

The hovering ball of light you see seemingly projected from the sculpture is achieved with nothing more than simple materials and ambient light. Thousands of precision holes in the black panels operate in a similar way to the lens in a camera and direct light to a focal point. The result is the illusion of a levitating 3D sphere.

This artwork and optical device challenges and astounds our perception in novel ways.

  1. Observe how the ball of light hovers in place as you move through the room.
  2. Walk into the ball of light. You may need to move your head higher or lower to find the exact center.
  3. Watch as another person walks into the ball of light.
  4. Look through the back side of the sculpture. What happens when someone on the front side stands in the ball of light.
