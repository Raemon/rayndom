# Welcome to the Tinkering Studio! 

The Tinkering Studio is a place to explore art, science, and technology by making something tangible and personally meaningful. We see tinkering as an approach to learning: hands-on, curiosity-driven, and grounded in real materials and phenomena you can see and touch. We create open-ended experiences for learners and educators to experiment, share ideas, and develop understanding together.

### Your Ideas Lead the Way 

With practice, tinkering can become a mindset. It shows us that the world is knowable and changeable, and that each of us has the agency to shape our own learning journey. In the Tinkering Studio, the learner’s idea is the big idea, and we are here to support it.
