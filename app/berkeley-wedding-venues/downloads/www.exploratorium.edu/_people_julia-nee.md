Julia Nee's work involves research and evaluation of exhibits and experiences in informal educational environments like the Exploratorium. She holds a PhD in linguistics from the University of California, Berkeley, where she designed, implemented, and evaluated informal language programs for learners of Zapotec, an Indigenous language of southern Mexico. Julia also worked as a researcher at Berkeley's Center for Equity, Gender & Leadership, creating practical resources to help guide leaders in technology to develop equitable language practices in emerging artificial intelligence tools. Prior to her PhD studies, she taught English at the college level in Oaxaca, Mexico. Whether in her role as a linguist, educator, or evaluator, Julia is motivated to use language to build understanding among people with diverse viewpoints and experiences, and to then build on that understanding to create joyful educational experiences.
