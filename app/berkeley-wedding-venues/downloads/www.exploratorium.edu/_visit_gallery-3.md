# Bechtel Gallery 3: Seeing & Listening

![An Exploratorium Explainer is surrounded by students watching closely as she dissects a cow's eye, explaining what she's doing, and engaging their curiosity.](/sites/default/files/styles/responsive_200w/public/2025-07/Explainers-cows-eye-3_Marquee.jpg.webp?itok=Fr4AhXrV)

Bechtel Gallery 3: Seeing & Listening

Experiment with your perceptions of light, sound, and heat.

We are surrounded by light and sound traveling in waves. By perceiving these waves with our eyes, our ears, and our brains, we make sense of the world around us. Experiment with light, mirrors, sounds, heat, and your own perceptions. See what you can discover.
