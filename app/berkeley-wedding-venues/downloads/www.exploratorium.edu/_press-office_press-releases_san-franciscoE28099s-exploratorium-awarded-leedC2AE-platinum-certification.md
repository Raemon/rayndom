The Exploratorium today announced that its facility at Pier 15 has been awarded LEED® Platinum certification by the U.S. Green Building Council. LEED is the foremost program for the design, construction and operation of green buildings, and the most recognized third-party verification system for green buildings. 

The Exploratorium’s project application was filed under the US Green Building Council's "LEED for New Construction v.2009" rating system, and is one of six projects in San Francisco to receive the platinum rating under this system.

In September 2012 the Exploratorium [ _announced its intent to become the largest net-zero energy use museum in the U.S._](http://www.exploratorium.edu/press-office/press-releases/exploratoriums-net-zero-energy-goal-new-waterfront-home-2013), if not the world, at its new home at San Francisco’s Pier 15. On April 17, 2013 the Exploratorium opened its 330,000 square feet of indoor and outdoor space on Pier 15, and since then has been monitoring energy efficiency and tinkering with systems in order to fulfill that goal. The achievement of LEED Platinum certification is a consequence of the Exploratorium’s efforts toward sustainable construction, operations and the continued work toward a net zero energy goal.

“LEED Platinum certification sets the stage for us to continue on with our sustainability goals as we work towards achieving net-zero energy,” says Shani Krevsky, Exploratorium Campus Project Director.
