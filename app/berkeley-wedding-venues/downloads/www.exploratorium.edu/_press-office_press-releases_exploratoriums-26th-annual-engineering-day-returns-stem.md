**SAN FRANCISCO (September 8, 2025)** – The Exploratorium invites visitors to its 26th annual [Engineering Day](https://www.exploratorium.edu/visit/calendar/engineering-day), an all-day celebration of engineering on Saturday, September 27. The event offers interactive activities, inspiring talks, and cultural experiences—conducted in Spanish and English—to spark curiosity and creativity in aspiring engineers of all ages and backgrounds.

The Exploratorium is once again partnering with the [Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers](https://shpe.org/) (SHPE) and is excited to welcome two new partners this year: the local Bay Area chapter of the [National Society of Black Engineers](https://www.nsbebayarea.org/) (NSBE) and the Stanford University chapter of the [American Indian Science and Engineering Society](https://aises.stanford.edu/index.html) (AISES). Together, these organizations will help create opportunities for visitors to connect with engineers and STEM educators while exploring the diverse pathways into STEM careers.

“Engineering Day is such a unique opportunity for young people to not only tinker and build, but to imagine themselves as future scientists and engineers,” said Ivan Torres, Exhibit Engineer at the Exploratorium. “It’s an important and powerful thing when they see people who share their language, culture, or background thriving in STEM careers; it helps them recognize that they belong in these fields too.”

Event highlights include:

  * **Interactive Activities:** Guests can participate in various hands-on engineering activities—including Curve It Like Curry, Bend It Like Beckham!—where guests will build their own catapult, explore the physics at work behind it, and relate it to sports. This year’s programming spans many facets of engineering, including electrical, structural, mechanical, aerospace, biological, and more.
  * **Inspiring Talks and Panel Discussions:** Attendees can engage with a variety of panels and speakers, including a bilingual Meet the Engineers Panel, where STEM professionals share their personal journeys, challenges, and successes in their fields.
  * **Community Engagement and Networking:** The event will bring together community organizations and resources that support representation in STEM, including a bilingual storytime and free book giveaway with the San Francisco Public Library (while supplies last).
  * **Live Musical Performance by**[**BULULÚ**](https://www.bululusf.com/)**:** The renowned San Francisco-based band returns to share their vibrant blend of traditional Latin music and modern influences.
