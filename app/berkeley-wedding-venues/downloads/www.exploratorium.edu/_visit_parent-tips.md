Plan Your Visit with Kids

A little planning goes a long way. Here are some ways to help your family get the most from your time at the museum.

##### Tickets & Membership

Kids under 3 visit free. Find information on ticket pricing [here](/visit#prices). And don’t forget, a [membership](/membership "Membership") pays for itself in as little as two visits.

##### Strollers

Strollers are welcome in the galleries. Loaners are available at the Information Desk (first come, first served). Do you have general questions about Accessibility? [Learn More →](/visit/accessibility "Accessibility at the Exploratorium")

##### Rest Areas

Comfy seating for rests and breastfeeding are scattered throughout the museum. Need a quiet spot to take a break? Slip away to the Fisher Bay Observatory Gallery or the rocking chairs on the south side of Moore Gallery 4, or head outside for Bay views and benches. Plus, try visiting on weekday afternoons and weekend mornings, which are generally less crowded.

##### Changing Tables and Breastfeeding

All restrooms have diaper-changing tables or counters (with the exception of the single-occupancy restroom next to The Tinkering Table Restaurant). Do you want privacy when breastfeeding? Ask a staff member wearing a colored vest for assistance.

##### Food and Beverages

Our [restaurant and café](/visit/restaurant-cafe "Restaurant & Café") both offer kid-friendly food options. You’re also welcome to bring your own snacks and take a break in designated outdoor eating areas.

##### Safety, Supervision, and Finding a Lost Child

For safety, adults should stay with children at all times. Our staff are always nearby to answer questions or lend a hand. 

If you lose track of your child or your child loses track of you, reach out to any staff member wearing a colored vest and they will reunite you.

##### Reentry

You can come and go. For reentry, get your hand stamped in the Ticketing Corridor or when exiting near the Tactile Dome. 

##### Enhance Your Visit

Exhibits invite hands-on exploration; we encourage touching, testing, and tinkering! At the Exploratorium, you’ll see no shushing security guards—just our outgoing facilitators. Look for staff in colored vests and ask them to share tips and tricks for exploring exhibits; to point you to our restaurant or café, our stores, or your favorite exhibit; and for help finding a lost child.

Cool Exhibits for Kids of All Ages

You’re never too young (or too old) to enjoy the Exploratorium. While our exhibits can be enjoyed by visitors of all ages, look out for these favorites for specific age groups.

#### Toddlers (Ages 1–3) 

###### Sensory Discoverers 

Toddlers love the sights, sounds, and textures of the museum. Look for mirrors, bubbles, and gentle light play. Quieter areas and outdoor exhibits are ideal for exploring together.

  * Play with [Colored Shadows](/exhibits/colored-shadows "Colored Shadows").
  * Capture a moment in time in [Shadow Box](/exhibits/shadow-box "Shadow Box").
  * Explore the science of bubbles at [Soap Film Painting](/exhibits/soap-film-painting "Soap Film Painting").
  * Levitate a beach ball at [Balancing Ball](/exhibits/balancing-ball "Balancing Ball").
  * Check out the [_Tinkerer’s Clock_](/exhibits/tinkerers-clock "Tinkerer's Clock") __ where cartoon characters oil, brush, and weld so it runs . . . like clockwork.

#### Younger Kids (Ages 4–7) 

###### Hands-On Experimenters

  * Envelop yourself in a gauzy embrace at [_Fog Bridge #72494_](/exhibits/fog-bridge-72494 "Fog Bridge #72494").
  * Explore [Monochromatic Room](/exhibits/monochromatic-room "Monochromatic Room") and its oddly colorless world.
  * Step into a miniature [Tornado](/exhibits/tornado "Tornado").
  * Discover unpredictable motion at [Chaotic Pendulum](/exhibits/chaotic-pendulum "Chaotic Pendulum").
  * Make spiky patterns on large magnets at [Black Sand](/exhibits/black-sand "Black Sand").

#### Older Kids (Ages 8–12) 

###### Curious Investigators

Older kids are ready to dive deeper. The prototyping area, physics exhibits, and building challenges are perfect for exploring how things work. Let them take the lead and share what they discover.

  * Check out [Glass Settling Plate](/exhibits/glass-settling-plate "Glass Settling Plate") and explore various Bay organisms.
  * Reveal interior worlds at the [Microscope Imaging Station](/exhibits/microscope-imaging-station "Microscope Imaging Station").
  * Experience [_Sun Painting_](/exhibits/sun-painting "Sun Painting")—its colorful canvas is in constant flux.
  * Build a [Catenary Arch](/exhibits/catenary-arch "Catenary Arch") that supports itself.
  * Use your voice to make visible patterns in sand at [_Chladni Singing_](/exhibits/chladni-singing "Chladni Singing").

#### Teens (13+)

###### Inventive Explorers

Teens often find inspiration from the art-meets-science experiences. They might explore independently, check out perception exhibits, or spend some extra time at a Demo Station to engage in a deeper exploration of a topic.

  * Float in space, or appear to, at [Anti-Gravity Mirror](/exhibits/anti-gravity-mirror "Anti-Gravity Mirror").
  * Catch the momentary beauty of a water drop falling into a pool at [Water-Drop Photography](/exhibits/water-drop-photography "Water-Drop Photography").
  * Make multiple rainbow-colored images of yourself at [_Recollections_](/exhibits/recollections "Recollections").
  * Create colorful mosaics of ice crystals at [Watch Water Freeze](/exhibits/watch-water-freeze "Watch Water Freeze").
