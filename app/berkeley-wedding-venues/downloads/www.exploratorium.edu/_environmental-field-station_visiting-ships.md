# Visiting Ships

Visiting Ships

Pier 17 is more than just a home for the Exploratorium, it’s a working port. We periodically host ships as they take a break between research and exploration missions along the West Coast and the Pacific. These vessels may be exploring and mapping the deep sea, studying environmental conditions, or assessing the health of ocean ecosystems.

The Exploratorium’s [Fisher Bay Observatory Gallery](/visit/gallery-6 "Fisher Bay Observatory Gallery 6: Observing Landscapes") offers an intimate view of these floating laboratories. And occasionally, visiting scientists or crew members take time out to talk with museum visitors about what it’s like to do science at sea.
