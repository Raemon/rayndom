# Teaching Sea Level Rise

![People wearing rubber boots, walking through puddles on a wet city street.](/sites/default/files/styles/responsive_200w/public/2024-11/01-21-2023-KingTides-37_marquee.jpg.webp?itok=GvTRLhyg)

Teaching Sea Level Rise

#### Hands-On Activities and Virtual Interactives

Sea level rise is one of the most visible and urgent impacts of climate change. This collection of classroom resources, videos, and hands-on science activities helps middle and high school students explore the causes and consequences of rising seas, including melting ice, warming oceans, extreme tides, and groundwater threats. Designed for secondary science educators, these adaptable lessons support NGSS-aligned learning and give students the tools to understand local impacts and engineer real-world solutions.

##### Topics:

  * Swelling Seas
  * Extreme Tides: A Window of What’s to come
  * Groundwater and Sea Level Rise
  * Visualizations, Environmental Justice, Solutions, and Resilience
  * Resources



## Swelling Seas

Why are sea levels rising? These resources help students explore two major causes—warming oceans and melting ice—through hands-on activities, climate models, and interactive visualizations. Together, they offer an entry point into the climate science behind a changing shoreline.

### Swelling Seas

##### Science Snack

Warmer water takes up more space. In this simple Science Snack, students observe how rising temperatures cause ocean water to expand—one of the main drivers of sea level rise.

### Melting Ice and Rising Seas

##### Science Snack

Melting ice is the major factor contributing to sea level rise, but how does the location of melting ice on Earth affect sea levels? Investigate with this model of seas and continents.

## Extreme Tides: A Window of What’s to Come

High tides help us see what sea level rise will look like in our communities, now and in the future. These resources use King Tides and tidal cycles to help students make connections between daily ocean rhythms and long-term climate change, using data, models, and local observations.

### _Royal Tides: A Preview to Sea Level Rise_

##### Video

Royal Tides, also known as King Tides, show us what everyday high tides could look like as sea levels rise. This video, created in partnership with the Port of San Francisco, helps students explore how tidal extremes reveal future risks, and what actions we can take now to prepare.

### Tide-o-matic

##### Science Snack

This hands-on activity models how and why tides occur, showing students the patterns behind high and low tides, and how rising seas may amplify their effects. It’s a useful foundation for understanding both tidal science and future climate impacts.

## Groundwater and Sea Level Rise

Sea level rise doesn’t just threaten coastlines from above. It also pushes groundwater up from below, increasing flood risks, damaging infrastructure, and mobilizing buried contaminants. These resources help students and communities explore this often-overlooked hazard through scientific models, interactive maps, and classroom investigations focused on the Bay Area’s vulnerable urban landscapes.

[ ![Groundwater rising next to a Bay Area freeway.](/sites/default/files/styles/responsive_3_2_350w/public/2025-06/ShallowGroundwater_Spotlight.jpg.webp?h=9e499333&itok=3XmsUR4F) ](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/80c2e4ff9a04461f98780a7505779131)

### Shallow Groundwater and Sea Level Rise

##### Interactive from Pathways Climate Institute, San Francisco Estuary Institute, UC Berkeley

Explore the Shallow Groundwater and Sea-Level Rise ArcGIS StoryMap , which highlights how rising sea levels can elevate groundwater in Bay Area counties, threatening infrastructure, increasing flood risks, and mobilizing contaminants. This interactive resource combines research and visuals to emphasize the need for integrated, surface-and-subsurface climate planning.

### Groundwater and Sea Level Rise Model

##### Science Snack (Under Development)

Help us test a new Science Snack! In this modeling activity, students investigate how sea level rise can infiltrate pore spaces underground, pushing fresh groundwater up and saltwater inland. Using simple materials, they can explore how this hidden hazard affects contaminants and groundwater levels near coastlines.

## Visualizations, Environmental Justice, Solutions, and Resilience

How can we prepare for the impacts of sea level rise in our communities? These resources invite students to explore real-world adaptation strategies through hands-on engineering, data exploration, and local planning tools. From modeling solutions to mapping flood risks, students engage in critical thinking and problem solving grounded in their own environments.

### Adapting to Rising Tides: Bay Shoreline Flood Explorer

##### Interactive from BCDC

This interactive tool developed by the Bay Conservation and Development Commission (BCDC) allows users to investigate potential flooding due to sea level rise and storm surges in Bay Area locations. As users change water levels to match future sea level scenarios, the Flood Explorer shows areas of inundation. Additionally, map layers include the potential consequences such as flooded infrastructure, transportation systems, and vulnerable communities, highlighting environmental justice issues of sea level rise.
