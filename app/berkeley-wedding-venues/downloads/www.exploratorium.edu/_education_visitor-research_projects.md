The Cultural Roots of STEM

The Cultural Roots of STEM is an NSF-funded synthesis project examining the extent, range, and nature of existing literature on STEM knowledge systems beyond the dominant Western paradigm to explore how informal science learning (ISL) settings might better recognize and support learners with diverse worldviews and ways of knowing.

Cells to Self

The Cells to Self exhibit collection reveals the wondrous variety of human cells and explores how genetic and environmental forces create each uniquely human self.

The research and evaluation projects supporting this collection aim to develop new biology experiences for museum visitors, and evaluate the effectiveness of prototype exhibits to better understand how visitors engage with and learn at these exhibits.

Seeing Scientifically

Seeing Scientifically is an NSF-funded project that studies how to encourage and support visitors in observing the way scientists do when looking at life through a microscope. The project’s goals are to help museum visitors at an interactive microscope exhibit to:

  * ask questions that will lead to a rich investigation,
  * interpret often complex microscope images, and
  * draw logical conclusions based on what they are seeing.

Indoor Positioning System (IPS)

This project was an NSF-funded exploratory research project that sought to generate early knowledge about the capabilities and limitations of an indoor positioning system for the museum field to (1) automate the collection of timing and tracking data for visitor research, and (2) enable location-aware applications designed to enhance museum visitor learning. Tools and techniques developed in this project can be found on bitbucket.

Seeing

Seeing represents a major modernization of one of the Exploratorium’s oldest and best-known exhibit collections and illustrates the fundamental power of visual images across times and cultures. The collection’s exhibits are informed by the work of dedicated researchers to suggest how vision works, but the visual experiences they provide also demonstrate why humans have been fascinated with sight for centuries.
