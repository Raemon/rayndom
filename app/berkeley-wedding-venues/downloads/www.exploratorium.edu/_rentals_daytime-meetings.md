![Daytime Meetings, Events & Filmings](/sites/default/files/styles/responsive_200w/public/2023-03/visit_rentals_daytime-meetings_marquee.jpg.webp?itok=ArPeEMbQ)

Daytime Meetings, Events & Filmings

Unique meeting and event spaces that inspire creativity.

We are pleased to offer our [Fisher Bay Observatory Gallery & Terrace](https://www.exploratorium.edu/visit/rentals/bay-observatory-gallery-terrace) and [Kanbar Forum](https://www.exploratorium.edu/visit/rentals/kanbar-forum) for daytime business meetings, team building, and seminars every day of the week. Take advantage of a unique opportunity and bring your team or clients offsite to an exciting venue that inspires creativity. All meeting packages include guest admission to the museum during open hours (except closed Mondays and Tuesdays).

We also have the unique opportunity to host daytime events in larger gallery spaces on closed Mondays and Tuesdays. [The Bechtel Central & Outdoor Gallery](https://www.exploratorium.edu/visit/rentals/central-gallery) is our largest single-gallery space and can accommodate trade shows, luncheons for 500 guests, or theater-style presentations for 600. 

With our gorgeous Bay Bridge views, ample outdoor space, unique gallery designs, flexible layouts, and engaging exhibits, the Exploratorium is also your ideal venue for location shoots and filmings.
