# Field Trips Getting Here

![A busy urban scene with people standing on a crowded sidewalk near a train station or public transportation hub.](/sites/default/files/styles/responsive_200w/public/2024-05/Fieldtrip-Getting-Here_marquee.jpg.webp?itok=A48DFS0B)

Field Trips Getting Here

There are so many ways to get to the Exploratorium. Arrive by BART, ferry, city bus, private bus, or car.

The Exploratorium is located at Pier 15 on the Embarcadero (at Green Street) in San Francisco.

##### Field Trips Are Bartable

BART is a great way to get to the Exploratorium from points within San Francisco and the greater Bay Area. We're an easy ten-minute walk from Embarcadero Station.

##### San Francisco Bay Ferry

Skip San Francisco traffic, don't worry about parking, and add a scenic boat ride to your trip: take the ferry to the Exploratorium! The museum is just a [ten-minute walk](/node/3681 "Getting Here & Parking ") from the Ferry Building. For the [San Francisco Bay Ferry](https://sanfranciscobayferry.com/), visit their [School Groups page](https://sanfranciscobayferry.com/school-groups) and for the [Golden Gate Ferry](https://www.goldengate.org/ferry/schedules-maps/), visit their [Group Sales page](https://www.goldengate.org/ferry/ferry-fares-payment/group-sales/).

##### MUNI

San Francisco's MUNI bus system can drop you right [at the Exploratorium's door](/node/3681 "Getting Here & Parking ")—the MUNI F-line streetcar stops directly in front of the Exploratorium. [Check the schedule and plan your route](https://www.sfmta.com/) before you come. 

##### CalTrain

The Exploratorium is a 20-minute MUNI ride from the San Francisco [CalTrain](https://www.caltrain.com/main.html) station at 4th and King Streets. From the CalTrain station, you can take the MUNI [N Judah line](https://www.sfmta.com/routes/n-judah) in the outbound direction and get off at Embarcadero Station, then walk [ten minutes north on the Embarcadero](/node/3681 "Getting Here & Parking ") to reach the museum.

##### School or Charter Bus

If you're coming by school bus or charter bus, we can help—please see [Bus Routes for Field Trips and Other Groups](/visit/field-trips/bus-routes "Bus Routes for Field Trips and Other Groups") for parking information, approved routes to the Exploratorium, and a schedule of arrival times. All buses must use approved routes to the Exploratorium—don’t delay your visit by taking an inaccessible route!

##### Car

If you plan to come by car, there are parking lots nearby, in addition to street parking on surrounding streets. Our [Directions and Parking](/node/3681 "Getting Here & Parking ") page will tell you everything you need to know.
