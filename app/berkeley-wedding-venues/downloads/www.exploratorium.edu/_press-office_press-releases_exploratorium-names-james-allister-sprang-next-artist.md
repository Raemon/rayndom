**SAN FRANCISCO (December 2, 2025)** – The Exploratorium is delighted to announce [James Allister Sprang](https://www.jamesallistersprang.com/) as its next [Artist-In-Residence (AIR)](/arts/artist-residence "Artist-in-Residence Program"), following the museum’s first-ever open call for the program. Launched in 1974, the Exploratorium’s AIR program has invited artists and performers to collaborate with scientists, educators, and the public in exploring perception, art, and inquiry. Over the past five decades, the program has supported hundreds of artists, including luminaries such as Ruth Asawa, Ned Kahn, and Brian Eno.

This year marked a milestone for the program, as the Exploratorium opened applications to the public for the first time. The response was extraordinary, with more than 500 artists from across the globe applying for the opportunity to embed within the Exploratorium’s unique ecosystem of curiosity and experimentation. From this remarkable pool, five finalists were selected for review, with Sprang chosen as the next Artist-in-Residence.

Sprang is a multidisciplinary artist who creates audiovisual poems for the spirit. Using advanced spatial audio, he is a pioneer in developing “sonic holograms” that facilitate immersive forms of storytelling. His work blends sound, woven paper artworks, and poetry to explore deep listening, resilience, and diasporic lineages. Sprang holds an MFA from the University of Pennsylvania and a BFA from The Cooper Union. His projects have been presented at institutions including The Concertgebouw, the Institute of Contemporary Art (Maine), The Public Theater, and the Apollo Theater.

“The enthusiasm and creativity we saw through this open call reaffirms how deeply artists continue to engage with the questions we ask here every day,” said Ann Meisinger, Project Director of the Artist-in-Residence program. “The sheer range and quality of proposals made this an incredibly inspiring and competitive process. We can’t wait to see how James' work will unfold in collaboration with our community.”

Past projects have included multimedia performances, theatrical productions, installations, and interactive online works.
