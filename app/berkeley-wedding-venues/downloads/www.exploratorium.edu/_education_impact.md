Teachers Matter

See how we bring science to life in classrooms with our Teaching & Learning 2025 Impact Report.

**The Exploratorium is a professional home and hub for PreK–12 teachers and leaders and a local laboratory for global science learning.** Teachers matter to student achievement more than anything else in school. That’s why for over 40 years we’ve offered transformative teaching and learning experiences to the educators who serve millions of students in California and beyond. From our beloved Summer Institute to new ways to teach climate change, we are devoted to helping teachers thrive.

Science is valued and built into the master plan, but it’s always the first thing to go … in terms of standards-based science education, it’s a bleak landscape.

## About Teaching & Learning

### What’s at stake

**Public education is struggling to give young people the science learning they need to thrive in the 21st century.** Science teaching is underfunded and deprioritized; serious teacher shortages and systemic inequities in instruction are disrupting learning. This crisis unfolds against a backdrop of increased public mistrust in science. The immediate result is that only 30% of students meet grade-level science standards. The broader effect is that young people aren't being equipped to shape a more just and sustainable future.

**We know teachers make a difference.** Better instructional practices correlate positively with better student outcomes. And public schools are ground zero for reestablishing broader trust in science and empowering young people to think critically. But teachers need support to stay and inspire in the classroom. That’s where we come in.

### What we do

We believe in bringing the Exploratorium’s commitment to science inquiry to where students do most of their learning—schools. Our professional learning programs provide teachers with the long-term support, community, and tools they need to tackle challenges and thrive at every stage of their careers. We offer:

  * **Direct professional learning** for public PreK–12 educators
  * **Statewide support network** of PreK–12 science education leaders
  * **Free access** to high-quality classroom resources



### Why us

In 1969, the Exploratorium’s vision for science learning was radical. Today, our hands-on, curiosity-led approach is built into K–12 science standards nationwide. Since 1984, we’ve shaped the education field with extraordinary professional development shaped by our unique capabilities:

  * **A leader in inquiry-based pedagogy,** co-developed with staff scientists and grounded in real-world phenomena
  * **A one-of-a-kind museum environment** where teachers can explore, experiment, and even build exhibits for their classrooms in a hands-on community of learners
  * **A trusted partner in science education,** shaping practice and policy through deep collaboration with a statewide network of education leaders

I find myself encouraging colleagues to be curious alongside their students, to embrace not knowing, and to find joy in discovery. The Exploratorium showed me that this mindset isn’t just allowed—it’s powerful.

–Minu Basu, _biology teacher_

## How we transform teaching

### Bring science learning to life

For students and teachers to thrive, we believe that science has to be interesting enough to both teach and learn. The Exploratorium is a laboratory for learning experiences that can profoundly change the way PreK–12 educators teach science.

  * **Inquiry-driven and hands-on:** Exploratorium pedagogy models the scientific process and fosters critical thinking.
  * **Learner-centered:** Teachers become learners, deepening their science knowledge, uncovering misconceptions, and building empathy for students.
  * **Joyful and inclusive:** Our approach helps educators embrace challenges and cultivate a love of learning that extends to their students and communities.

### Meet teachers where they are

The Exploratorium is an educator basecamp for professional growth and community. Whether elementary or secondary, from early career to established, we provide educators with the right support at the right times in their careers. We empower young teachers, help isolated innovators grow into connected changemakers, and connect alumni with leadership opportunities. 

  * This year **750 educators** returned an avg. 3–4 times for 1,800 total sessions
  * **156 experienced teachers** developed into mentors and leaders
  * **86 educators of Color** built community around culturally grounded science teaching, leadership, and well-being
  * **51 early-career teachers** benefited from tools, community, and coaching



Every time I take a class at the Exploratorium, I am reminded of why I love teaching, and I return to class more excited to be a science teacher.

–Mike Schulist, _8th-grade teacher_

## How we scale our impact

[ ![The image shows a circular diagram with five labeled sections, representing different educational roles and communities.](/sites/default/files/2025-08/Virtuous%20circle_v3.png) ](/sites/default/files/2025-08/Virtuous%20circle_v3.png)

### Strengthen the educator ecosystem

Teachers, mentors, administrators, and professional learning providers depend on each other to serve California’s millions of students. Targeting unmet needs in this ecosystem creates a virtuous circle that helps _everyone_ thrive—especially the students.

  * This year we equipped **science teacher leaders** to coach and facilitate professional learning for **early career educators**
  * Piloted a **climate science leadership program** with statewide partners to support NGSS and systems thinking in PreK–12
  * Partnered with a local district to train **18 elementary teachers** in inquiry-based science, strengthening instruction district-wide and growing local leadership

### Multiply our impact through leaders

Our network of science education leaders multiplies our impact 100-fold across California. Since 2018 we’ve built a growing network of teachers who support their peers in science instruction. Year after year these experienced educators convene, share strategies, and mentor the teachers in their districts, resulting in more hands-on science for millions of students statewide.

  * This year the network numbered **1,600 teacher leaders** (and growing)
  * **160,000 classroom teachers** in all **58 counties** received support
  * Est. **2 million students** were impacted

The expert staff of the Exploratorium provide high-quality and thoughtful professional development for all science educators, and the learning builds individual, school, and district-wide capacity to support science for all.

–Nathan Inouye, _Assistant Director of Instructional Services, Moorpark Unified School District_
