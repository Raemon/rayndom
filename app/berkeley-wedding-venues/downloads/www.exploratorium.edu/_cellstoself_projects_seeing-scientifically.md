Seeing Scientifically

This project studied how to encourage and support visitors in observing as scientists do when looking at life through a microscope.

Seeing Scientifically, funded by the National Science Foundation, studied how to encourage and support visitors in observing as scientists do when looking at life through a microscope.

Its goals were to help museum visitors at an interactive microscope exhibit to:

  * ask questions that lead to a rich investigation.
  * interpret often complex microscope images.
  * draw logical conclusions based on what they see.



Seeing Scientifically developed a touch screen interface for the Exploratorium’s Microscope Imaging Station. The project experimented with ways to provide just-in-time guidance on what and how to observe, and ways to adapt this information to the ever-changing live specimen in view.
