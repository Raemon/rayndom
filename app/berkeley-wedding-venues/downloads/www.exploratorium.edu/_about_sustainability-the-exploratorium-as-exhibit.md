# The Exploratorium as Exhibit

# The Exploratorium as Exhibit

Located at Pier 15 on San Francisco Bay, the Exploratorium is one of the first and one of the largest zero net energy museums in the world. With 330,000 square feet of indoor and outdoor space, the award-winning waterfront museum is itself a dynamic exhibit on green building and sustainability. As with all Exploratorium exhibits, we invite you to try it and discover how it works.

## 1\. Green Building & Design

From the initial decision to preserve and renovate the historic building at Pier 15 using recycled materials, the Exploratorium’s building and design reflect our commitment to sustainability. In 2013, the _San Francisco Chronicle_ called us “[the ultimate green building](https://blog.sfgate.com/cityinsider/2013/04/10/the-new-exploratorium-the-ultimate-green-buildingsan-francisco%E2%80%99s-exploratorium-its-internationally-famed-museum-of-science-art-and-human-perception-is-only-a-week-away-from-opening-on-wedn/),” and in 2014 we received LEED Platinum certification from the U.S. Green Building Council.

## 2\. Zero Net Energy Efficiency

Exploratorium at Pier 15: A Green Machine

In 2023 we achieved our historic goal of net zero energy operations, becoming the largest net zero museum in the U.S. There are many complex definitions of zero net energy, but ours is simple: Over the course of one year, we produce as much energy as we consume. Our 80,000-square-foot rooftop is covered with solar panels that generate an average of 2,000 MWh of renewable energy each year. Through the combination of solar energy, energy-efficient building systems, and ample natural light, we produced 128% of our energy needs on site in 2022.

## 3\. Bay Water Heating and Cooling System

Not only is the Exploratorium zero net energy, it's also low-carbon because it uses no natural gas. By using Bay water for geothermal exchange, our heating and cooling system controls the building’s temperature without the need for a cooling tower or boiler. This saves over two million gallons of potable water a year.

## 4\. Sustainability Education

The Exploratorium's [Fisher Bay Observatory](/visit/gallery-6 "Fisher Bay Observatory Gallery 6: Observing Landscapes") and [Living Systems](/visit/gallery-4 "Gordon and Betty Moore Gallery 4: Living Systems") galleries encourage visitors to investigate the history, geography, and ecosystems of the Bay Area. Our building is [fitted with sensors](/node/4123 "Wired Pier | Exploratorium Environmental Field Station ") that help scientists better understand the impact of climate change in urban settings, and provides a venue for critical conversations about the environment.

## 5\. Participation

From opportunities to engage with environmental exhibits and breathe 100% outside air, to dual-flush toilets that use harvested rainwater, visitors can experience our sustainable building and its operations first-hand.

Even the Exploratorium's location at the edge of downtown with ample access to public transportation helps reduce our carbon footprint. We invite you to walk, bike, or take transit to our location on Pier 15, and see for yourself.
