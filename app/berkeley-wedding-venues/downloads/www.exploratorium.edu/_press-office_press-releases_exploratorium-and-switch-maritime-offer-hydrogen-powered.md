**SAN FRANCISCO (October 15, 2025)** – The Exploratorium is teaming up with SWITCH Maritime to give visitors a unique, hands-on experience with cutting-edge hydrogen-powered maritime technology. Guests can take a free ride aboard the Sea Change, the first commercial zero-emissions ferry in the U.S. powered entirely by hydrogen fuel cells, and join a tech tour to learn how this innovative vessel operates.

[Hydrogen-powered ferry rides](https://www.exploratorium.edu/visit/calendar/hydrogen-powered-boat-ride-switch-maritime) will take place on select Saturdays (October 18, 25; November 1, 8, 15, 22, 29; December 6, 13, 2025), with cruises departing at 12:00 p.m. and 1:30 p.m. A Sea Change Tech Tour will also take place at 12:45 p.m., offering an up-close look at the vessel’s hydrogen fuel cells and other sustainable technologies. SWITCH Maritime staff will guide small groups through key areas of the ferry, explaining how hydrogen powers the ship and highlighting its potential as a clean energy solution.

“This collaboration is yet another way for the public to learn in experiential ways. We want to make science tangible and memorable, giving guests the chance to see, touch, and explore real-world applications of emerging technology,” said Sam Sharkland, Program Director, Public Programs at the Exploratorium. “It’s one thing to read about hydrogen power; it’s another to see it in action and take a peek under the hood. These visceral experiences are core to the Exploratorium, and SWITCH has been a wonderful partner in bringing this learning to life.”

Founded in 2018, SWITCH Maritime has developed and operationalized the Sea Change along with the supporting hydrogen fuel supply chain. The fuel cells onboard the Sea Change use hydrogen to produce electricity, which powers the ferry’s electric motors. The only emission from the hydrogen fuel cell powertrain is pure water (H2O) vapor.

The Sea Change completed a six-month demonstration and commissioning period within the public SF Bay Ferry system. The demonstration with SF Bay Ferry provided a foundation for SWITCH to increase vessel operator awareness of the technology, fine-tune systems, and show the viability of fuel cells in commercial maritime applications. This partnership with the Exploratorium builds on that work, offering an expanded platform to demonstrate how science, engineering, and innovation can transform transportation in real-world conditions, ahead of the Sea Change’s next transition into longer-term passenger service.

“We’re thrilled to team up with the Exploratorium to show the public that hydrogen-powered ferries can perform just like diesel ferries, just without the black smoke,” said Elias Van Sickle, CEO of SWITCH Maritime. “Seeing and experiencing the technology firsthand brings the science to life and inspires people of all ages to imagine a cleaner future.”

Visitors of all ages are invited to climb aboard, take a free ride on the Sea Change, and explore the ferry’s innovative hydrogen technology.
