# Tinkering Studio Projects

## Projects

The Tinkering Studio is primarily an R&D laboratory on the floor of the Exploratorium, but whenever possible we try to share our projects, activities, and developing ideas following an “open source” model. Learn how you too can enjoy our activities in your kitchen, garage, classroom, and community.
