Field Trip Resources

We have resources that you can use before, during, and after your field trip, including classroom activities and tips for your chaperones. 

### Recommended Planning Tools

##### Student Planning Page

Fill out this [student planning page (PDF)](/sites/default/files/2023-08/FT_Student_Planning_page.pdf "FT_Student_Planning_page.pdf ") with your students to help them prepare for the day logistically. It will help them remember things such as what to bring, who is in their group, and why they are going on a field trip.

##### Chaperone Tips

This guide will help your chaperones plan for the field trip. It includes tips on exploring exhibits with students, as well as space to record meeting times and places. Available in English, Spanish, and Chinese.
