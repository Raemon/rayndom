What's Hot, What's Not?

See yourself with infrared vision.

At this exhibit, an infrared camera detects the heat radiating from warm objects and projects it on a big screen, allowing you to see what’s hot (and not) about you and the other people and objects in your surroundings.

What's going on?

This camera is sensitive to _infrared light_ , an invisible form of energy given off by objects and people alike. Warmer objects radiate more infrared light than cooler objects do, and appear brighter on the projected image.

The aluminum table in front of the bench at this exhibit is a good _thermal conductor:_ heat moves through it quickly. When you touch a shape, heat flows easily from your hand to the metal, cooling your skin and creating a dark pattern. As your skin warms, the pattern fades.

The various panels behind the bench at this exhibit reflect some forms of energy better than others. Acrylic reflects visible light but not infrared radiation, so your reflection doesn’t show up on the screen. The unpolished copper reflects visible light poorly, so you can’t see yourself in it. But copper _does_ reflect infrared rays—which is why you can see reflected images in the copper panel when you look at it on the screen.

Going further

Infrared cameras are used in some night vision systems, in industry, astronomy, and to help find heat leaks in insulated homes.

Like the camera in this exhibit, rattlesnakes can “see” infrared light—but not with their eyes. Instead, they use infrared-sensing organs called pits, found between the nostril and eye. Being able to sense infrared light helps rattlesnakes and other pit vipers track their warm-blooded prey.
