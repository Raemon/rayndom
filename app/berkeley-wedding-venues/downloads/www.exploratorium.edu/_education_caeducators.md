K–12 Science Leader Network

The Exploratorium is supporting NGSS implementation across California.

## Changing Science Education in California

At the Exploratorium, we believe every student deserves the opportunity to learn science, and that the best way to _learn_ science is to _do_ science. Hands-on science inquiry empowers students to explore natural phenomena, tackle complex challenges, access economic opportunities, and solve real-world problems.

  
Yet, many California students, particularly those in our most vulnerable communities, still lack access to high-quality science education. To address this, the Exploratorium launched the K–12 Science Leader Network in 2016—a dynamic, growing community of educators serving as change agents in their districts, from remote rural areas to urban centers.

  
Through sustained, inquiry-based professional development and a collaborative statewide network, we are leveraging the power of educators to create lasting change. Together, we are working to ensure that all California students have the opportunity to succeed and thrive in science.

"Nothing has created as much value as actually knowing what ‘teaching along NGSS standards’ looks like. I haven’t got as much value out of anything outside the Exploratorium. Nothing’s come close. It’s one of the reasons why I keep coming back, not only because of the relationships, but also it makes me better for my kids and for my students. There isn’t a training that’s come close to it.” Eric Cross, 7th Grade Science/Technology Teacher, Grade Level Lead, and Adjust professor of learning and technology at University of San Diego

“I feel so fortunate to have found a professional home at the Exploratorium that has supported me throughout every stage of my career.” Daisy Yeung, Instructional Coach, Sequoia Union High School District Redwood City, CA

“Because NGSS and Common Core mathematics are all about student-centered sense-making, what better group to get involved with in the world, really [than the Exploratorium], as they are experts in student-centered inquiry.” Kirk Brown, Director of STEM, San Joaquin County Office of Education Stockton, CA
