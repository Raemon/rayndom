Wonder Funday

## A STEAM Festival by the Bay

Thank you for being a part of Wonder Funday 2025! 

We hope you and your loved ones had a delightful afternoon filled with STEAM discovery, fun, and transformational impact. 

Your family’s generous support of Wonder Funday helps the Exploratorium fund community access programs, including School Field Trips. Last year, our Field Trip program welcomed **over 95,000 students, teachers, and chaperones**. Over half of these guests visited free from Title I schools. 

We’re so grateful for your participation as part of a creative community of philanthropic families in the Bay Area. The impact of your support for STEAM education will continue to inspire Bay Area youths for years to come. 

Thank you again, and we can’t wait to welcome you back to Pier 15.
