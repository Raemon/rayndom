Microscope Imaging Station

Research-grade microscopes reveal interior worlds of living, changing cells.

The Microscope Imaging Station at the Exploratorium provides a unique opportunity to explore the microscopic world.

At this exhibit, you can select among various specimens, move over them, change the magnification and focus, and, where appropriate, change the lighting to illuminate the specimen or use reflected light and fluorescence to dramatically change how the specimens look.
