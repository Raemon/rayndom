# Environmental Science Snacks

# Environmental Science Snacks

[Science Snacks](https://www.exploratorium.edu/snacks) are hands-on, teacher-tested activities that bring explorations of natural phenomena into the classroom and home. These Snacks explore phenomena and data that can help us understand Earth's atmosphere and oceans. The Exploratorium collects real-time weather and atmospheric data at our [Wired Pier Environmental Field Station](https://www.exploratorium.edu/environmental-field-station) at Pier 15 in San Francisco.
