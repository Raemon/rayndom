# Inquiry-Based Science and English Language Development

# Inquiry-Based Science and English Language Development

Exploring the connections between science learning and language development.

Inquiry-based Science and English Language Development

#### Inquiry-based science and English language development are a natural fit.

Inquiry-based science creates a rich environment for language use, making it an ideal approach for English language development. Through questioning, predicting, sharing ideas, and debating, students use language authentically to connect with the scientific phenomena they’re exploring. For English language learners, this process offers meaningful opportunities to practice and develop their language skills in a supportive, engaging context.

#### Classrooms are becoming increasingly diverse.

With linguistic diversity growing nationwide, today’s classrooms are more diverse than ever. By 2030, nearly 40% of U.S. school-age children will speak English as a second language. This shift, along with evolving educational standards, presents new challenges—and opportunities—for teachers.

#### Learn how to blend science learning and language development in your classroom. 

To help educators meet these challenges, the Institute for Inquiry partnered with the Sonoma Valley Unified School District. Together, we have developed a professional learning program equipping elementary teachers with strategies to integrate science learning and English language development seamlessly.

#### Your Guide to Success

The [Educators Guide for Inquiry-Based Science and English Language Development](/education/ifi/inquiry-and-eld/educators-guide "Educators Guide") shares practical strategies from this groundbreaking partnership. Designed for teachers, professional development providers, and education leaders, the guide offers valuable tools to create language-rich, content-rich classrooms that foster science learning and linguistic growth.  


Discover how you can make science a powerful tool for language development in your classroom
