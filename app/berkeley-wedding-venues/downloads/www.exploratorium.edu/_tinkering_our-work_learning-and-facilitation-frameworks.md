# Learning and Facilitation Frameworks

Learning and Facilitation Frameworks

### Dimensions of Learning

#### 

#### Engagement

Indicators| Descriptors  
---|---  
Spending time in Tinkering activities| Learners: 

  * play, envision, make, explore materials, try something over and over, etc.

  
Displaying motivation or investment through affect or behavior| Learners: 

  * show emotions such as joy, pride, disappointment, frustration
  * remain after they appear “finished,” and start something new

  
  
#### 

#### Initiative and Intentionality

Indicators| Descriptors  
---|---  
Setting one’s own goals| Learners: 

  * set goals / pose problems
  * plan steps for future action
  * develop unique strategies, tools, objects or outcomes
  * state intention to continue working outside Studio

  
Seeking and responding to feedback| Learners: 

  * actively seek out feedback or inspiration from materials/environment
  * anticipate further outcomes
  * innovate approaches in response to feedback

  
Persisting to achieve goals in the problem space*| Learners: 

  * persist toward their goal in the face of setbacks or frustration within the problem space
  * persist to optimize strategies or solutions

  
Taking intellectual risks or showing intellectual courage| Learners: 

  * disagree with each other's strategies, solutions, or rationales
  * try something while indicating lack of confidence in outcome

  
  
*A problem space is a collection of questions, problems, materials, and solutions associated with trying to make something happen within the framework of the activity. For example, trying to keep a marble from falling off a track would be working within a problem space in Marble Machines. Distinguish between PS and just being in the TS. 

#### 

#### Social Scaffolding

Indicators| Descriptors  
---|---  
Requesting or offering help in solving problems| Learners in the role of novices or experts: 

  * request or offer ideas and approaches
  * offer tool(s) or materials in service of an idea

  
Inspiring new ideas or approaches| Learners: 

  * notice, point out, or talk about others’ work
  * innovate and remix by using or modifying others' ideas or strategies
  * leave something of their work behind to share with others

  
Physically connecting to others’ works| Learners produce work that physically interacts with other learners' work  
  
#### 

#### Development of Understanding

Indicators| Descriptors  
---|---  
Expressing a realization through affect or utterances| Learners: 

  * show excitement when expressing a realization
  * claim to realize or newly make sense of something

  
Offering explanation(s) for a strategy, tool or outcome| Learners offer or refine explanation(s) for a strategy, tool or outcome, possibly by testing and retesting  
Applying knowledge| Learners: 

  * connect to prior knowledge, including STEM concepts
  * employ what they have learned during their explorations
  * complexify by engaging in increasingly complicated and sophisticated work

  
Striving to understand| Learners indicate not knowing (e.g., through surprise, bewilderment, confusion) and remain in the problem space to explore their confusion and build an understanding  
  
### 

### Facilitation Moves

Facilitation Move| Descriptions of facilitator’s interactions  
---|---  
**Spark** initial interest and participation through demonstrations, modeling, parallel play, or questions| 

  * Uses demonstrations, modeling, parallel play and/or questions to help learners take up materials and begin
  * Establishes safe physical and psychological (non-judgmental and reciprocal) context for participation

  
**Sustain** participation through frustration, distraction, or boredom through introduction of new tools, approaches, or analyses| 

  * Provides new tools or ideas to scaffold learners through frustrating moments
  * Welcomes and works with learners' ideas and progress, including “mistakes” or wrong directions
  * Works with learners' ideas and creations to re-engage them as their interests and attention wane
  * “Re-voices” learners' ideas and choices in ways that others can understand and that might connect to everyday world, prior interests and experiences

  
**Deepen** understanding and commitment through complexification of concepts and making connections to learners’ interests| 

  * Helps to complexify the work through new ideas or tools, including making connections or analogs with prior experiences, everyday life and scientific practices
  *   * Uses questions, actions, or comments to encourage learners to talk about, share, reflect on, and develop their ideas

  
  
Please note that these two frameworks should be viewed as tools for discussion rather than rigorous schemes for coding behavior. To download a PDF version of the Learning Dimensions and our Facilitation Field Guide, click below.
