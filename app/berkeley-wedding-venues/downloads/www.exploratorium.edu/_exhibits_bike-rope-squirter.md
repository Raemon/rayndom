Bike Rope Squirter

Loops dance along the ground as visitors play an Exploratorium-style game of jump rope.

These upside down, bike-powered machines are built to throw ropes twenty feet into the air. Acting a bit like water and a bit like rope, the loops dance along the ground as visitors play an Exploratorium-style game of jump rope.
