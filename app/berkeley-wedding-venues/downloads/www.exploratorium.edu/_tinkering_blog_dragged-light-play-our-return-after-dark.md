Dragged Up Light Play & Our Return to After Dark

In December last year, the Tinkering Studio made its long-awaited return to the Exploratorium’s series of 21+ evening events called After Dark. For it, we wanted to honor the latest iteration of the annual light-themed exhibition put on by the museum called Glow by bringing our classic Light Play activity, and to make our return extra special included items for exploration that have been part of our ongoing computational tinkering work. In addition to the usual suspects like color filters, lenses, action figurines, household objects, and bendable point light sources, we also included some pre-programmed electronic tools. [Ryoko ](/tinkering/blog/cpx-pinhole-projects-light-and-shadow-experiments "CPX Pinhole Projects: Light and Shadow Experiments")[ _recently shared_](/tinkering/blog/cpx-pinhole-projects-light-and-shadow-experiments "CPX Pinhole Projects: Light and Shadow Experiments") some of the beautiful work she’s created with Circuit Playground Express (CPX) boards, which have sensors and LEDs built into them that allow for unique input and output combinations. We also included servo motors with lightweight armatures attached to them built by Michael, which extended the possibilities of movement. Both of these additions also work well in tandem with the OctoStudio app, allowing users to trigger sceneries even from some distance away or to select other effects.

We were motivated by a few key qualities of these tools that we thought would make Light Play’s already-rich interactions with illumination, movement, and storytelling that much more dynamic. The CPX pucks of LEDs have an endless array of color and pattern combinations, so we pre-programmed them in ways we thought begged for remixing. In one of the combinations, we used oranges, yellows, and reds to resemble either a sunrise or sunset scene that visitors could use to build narratives or color mixing effects as the hues melded together, and in another combination sent a single light into a loop across the circular shape formed by the LEDs on the board. This created a rapidly shifting staccato effect that acted as a delightful foil against the slow-moving motors we’re accustomed to using. During one of our R&D sessions to support our After Dark plans, I created this monster movie vignette that merged variations of both these functions.

I felt that the strobing light pattern oozed and evoked horror films, so I quickly constructed some characters and settings to amplify the aesthetic after seeing its interaction with other materials we had handy. My hope with the strobe was that two of the paper cutouts I made, a spooky tree and a gravestone, would cast shadows in mostly expected ways but at one point would converge with the angle of their cast shadows to produce an optical effect of a face smiling, like something out of Snow White or a Sleepy Hollow depiction. You can see a bit more of the construction here: 

With the servo motors, we were excited to see a different type of movement than that offered by our slowly-rotating motors with circular plank attachments. Michael cleverly implemented some armatures made from LEGO pieces that he attached to the motors so that they would extend in one direction and then retract, slowly in our case though they are capable of faster speeds. By attaching a flashlight to the LEGO arm, a dolly effect of illumination became possible without having to manually control it. This type of motion might be possible with the motors we’ve long used in the activity, but they would require some innovative finagling to achieve as dramatic and crisp an optical effect from the circular movement to backward-and-forward.. Michael's new constructions also used Maglite flashlights, which are quite bright compared to our bendable lights, so this meant that smaller objects’ shadows could grow and shrink exponentially, giving focus to details that could remain unseen before. Below is a really elegant demonstration of this effect that we had on display at the start of our After Dark session so that visitors could play and riff on it. The ability for the flashlight to be positioned so that its gaze of light could be fixed on an object provided a deeply satisfying gradual shifting of the scale of shadows that formed. This was particularly cool to see in combination with the colorized translucent shapes we have which could then blanket the entire space all the way down to a crisp miniaturization of the plastic gear shapes.

Events like After Dark are very social spaces, often with alcohol flowing, with all kinds of specialized programming happening across the museum floor. So, we had some concern that visitors might not explore these new digital tools in the activity at all, in favor of the other more familiar objects and their easily-discernible functions in the activity. We programmed some of the CPX and servo effects to be triggered by friendly animations on OctoStudio as one form of entry into these new items, so that visitors just needed to find a way to implement the style of motion or the color effects into their kinetic sculptures and then to decide if they wanted a switch that operated from further away or if up-close worked well enough. 

I also decided to co-facilitate the activity in drag, which I thought would help us entice people into the space and to bring a festive vibe to the holiday-ready activity and night. I have been a performing drag artist for many, many years and while I have brought my drag persona - named Imelda Glucose in honor of my Pilipino heritage - to the Exploratorium in a handful of ways over the years, this was my first time bringing my drag in this kind of context as a co-facilitator of a floor activity. I felt quite vulnerable bringing my art to my work like this, especially since many of my colleagues had not yet seen me in drag up to this point, but dispensed with my nervousness upon receiving such enthusiasm and warmth from Ryoko and Michael who co-facilitated with me, from other museum staff, and from the earliest visitor arrivals that night. Our small space proved to be quite the destination and we remained rather busy with construction and light effects through the whole night!

Light Play is an exploration of many things, but most of all it is an irresistible way to express narratives and stories, and we saw immense creativity and problem-solving. I’ll wrap up this reflection with some images captured of visitor-made kinetic light sculptures.
