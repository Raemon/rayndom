High School Explainer: PACE

Professional Advancement & Career Exposure

## Program Overview

The High School Explainer: PACE Program (Professional Advancement & Career Exposure) is designed to provide young people between the ages of 17–21 with supplemental museum work experience in areas such as Exhibit Maintenance, Public Programs, Cinema Arts, Bio Lab, and Explainer Program Administration. Explainers are exposed to a variety of museum disciplines while supporting the High School Explainer program in its core mission of providing an interactive social environment rich in both science and the arts in which students can explore phenomena, learn about themselves, and provide the museum with an informed and energetic floor staff.
