This series is made possible by the generous support of Marcia Grand.

Recent research shows that climate change is destabilizing ocean currents, and making ocean waters warmer and more acidic. What do these changes mean for ocean ecosystems and the humans that rely on them?

The Exploratorium is teaming up with Point Blue Conservation Science to dig into the details. Find out what’s happening in our seas and what we can do to minimize dangerous changes.
