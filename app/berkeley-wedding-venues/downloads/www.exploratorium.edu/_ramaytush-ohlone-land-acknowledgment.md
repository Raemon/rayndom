# Ramaytush Ohlone Land Acknowledgment

![Land Acknowledgment](/sites/default/files/styles/responsive_200w/public/2023-03/ramaytush-ohlone-land-acknowledgment_marquee.jpg.webp?itok=USi5-W-f)

Ramaytush Ohlone Land Acknowledgment

Share our appreciation and respect for the Ramaytush Ohlone whose perspectives and knowledge inspire us.

The area now known as San Francisco was once the home of the [Ramaytush Ohlone](https://www.ramaytush.org) peoples of the San Francisco Peninsula. As the original peoples of this land, the Ramaytush Ohlone have never ceded, lost, nor forgotten their responsibilities as the caretakers of this place. The Exploratorium is located upon their land and waters. 

We are thankful to our Ohlone collaborators for their generosity in helping us develop a stronger understanding of our connection to this place. 

The Exploratorium invites you to share in our appreciation and respect for the Ramaytush Ohlone whose perspectives and knowledge of the local environment continue to inspire us toward a more sustainable and resilient future together.

_Please take a moment to consider where you are—the waters of San Francisco Bay, the human-made shoreline, its structures, and the hills beyond. Think about the places you love, where you are from, and reflect on the history of those lands._
