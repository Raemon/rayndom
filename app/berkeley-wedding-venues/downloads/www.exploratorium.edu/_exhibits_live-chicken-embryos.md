Live Chicken Embryos

Take a look at living chicken embryos in various stages of development.

It takes just 21 days for an egg to go from just laid to newly hatched chick, and a lot goes on in just the first week. Look closely and you’ll find blood vessels, a backbone, wing buds, eyes, a brain, and—throbbing prominently by day 5 or so—a beating heart.

Chick Embryo Development

What’s going on?

The life of a chicken embryo begins inside the hen, before the egg is laid. A rooster deposits sperm into the hen’s reproductive tract. A sperm unites with a yolk cell, forming an embryo. The hard shell then grows around the yolk before it is laid.

After an egg is laid, an incubated egg develops quickly. What starts as a white spot on day one develops visible blood vessels on day two. Four or five days after being laid, the embryo has a visible backbone and a beating heart. After six or seven days, the wing buds, eyes, and brain are visible.

**Day 1**

(after hen lays egg and starts incubating it)  
Look for the white embryo in the center of the nutrient-rich yolk. All the embryos here look similar to developing human embryos.

**Day 2**

Look for developing blood vessels that will connect the embryo to the yolk, its source of food. This embryo has about four times as many cells as on day 1.

**Days 3 to 4**

Look for a backbone, blood vessels, and a beating heart. This embryo has four to fifteen times as many cells as a day 2 embryo.

**Days 5 to 7**

Look for the tiny wing buds, eyes, and brain. At this stage it still looks a lot like a human embryo. By day 21, the chick would be ready to hatch.
