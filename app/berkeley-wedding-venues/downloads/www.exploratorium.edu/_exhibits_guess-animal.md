Guess the Animal

Find out if you can guess the secret animal the AI has "in mind."

## Can you think like a computer?

## What’s going on?

If you find this game difficult, it’s because a computer doesn't think like you do. This exhibit uses a machine learning technique called embeddings, which represent things from real life as a list of numbers.

The scores you see are based partly on animal characteristics you might consider. For example, is this a mammal? But they also depend on how the word is used. “Cat” might be scored closer to “fish” than you might expect, simply because “catfish” is a common word.

Don’t forget to check out an IRL version of this game at our [_Adventures in AI_](/visit/calendar/ai "Adventures in AI") exhibition!

(Guess the Animal is inspired by [Semantle](https://semantle.com/), created by David Turner)
