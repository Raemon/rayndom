Black History Month

Visit the Exploratorium in February and look for profiles throughout the museum that honor **historic and contemporary Black scientists, innovators, activists, and artists** , each profile paired with a specific exhibit. 

Among others, learn about entrepreneur Madame C.J. Walker who was a self-made millionaire in the Black cosmetics industry; surgeon Charles Drew, the “father of the blood bank”; astronaut Mae Jemison, the first Black woman to travel to space (1992); and actor, singer, and fashion icon Billy Porter who was the first openly gay Black man to win a host of prestigious awards for his performances.
