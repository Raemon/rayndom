Visitor Engagement Facilitators

Visitor Engagement Facilitators work cross-functionally in visitor experience and visitor services roles to welcome and provide visitors with meaningful educational engagement throughout their journey.

## Program Overview

The Visitor Engagement Facilitators are a group of educators who support, inspire, and empower visitors. The group is diverse in their academic, professional, and life experiences. They work cross-functionally in visitor experience and visitor services roles to welcome and provide visitors with meaningful educational engagement throughout their journey: orienting field trip groups in the Plaza, interacting with visitors at Exhibits, facilitating learning experiences at Explainer stations, and supporting visitors in Ticketing, our Stores, and our Information Desk.
