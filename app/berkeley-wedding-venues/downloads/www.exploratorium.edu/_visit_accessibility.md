[The Tactile Dome](/visit/tactile-dome "Tactile Dome") provides a unique perceptual experience as you travel through a series of various textures in total darkness. The first room of the Tactile Dome is wheelchair accessible. The full Tactile Dome experience requires adequate upper-body strength to crawl, climb, and slide through the other rooms. Sign language interpreters or other necessary attendants are admitted free of charge, with advance notice. Lights will be turned on for those needing ASL interpretation.

These are located in the Crossroads and Moore Gallery 4.

### Visitors Needing Special Accommodation

##### Deaf, Hard of Hearing, or Hearing Impaired Visitors

We can guarantee an ASL interpreter with at least one week’s notice. To request this service, call our Reservations Office at 415.528.4407 or [email us](mailto:visit@exploratorium.edu). We may be able to accommodate a request with less notice.

##### Blind or Low Vision Visitors

We have tactile maps for blind or low vision visitors at the Information Desk.

##### Sensory Needs Visitors

The Exploratorium is a place designed to engage the senses, but some areas of the museum have lower levels of visual and auditory stimuli, including our outdoor spaces. Here are some tips for planning your visit.

  * Weighted lap pads, and sensory kits containing 5 fidget toys, 1 plush toy, sunglasses, ear protectors, and a communication board are available for loan at the Information Desk.
  * Consider becoming a Member to access members-only hours every Sunday from 10:00 a.m. to noon.
  * Visit late in the afternoon. Things generally quiet down after 3:00 p.m. And fall weekends are quieter, too.
  * Visit our quieter gallery spaces: The Atrium, Moore Gallery 4, The Fisher Bay Observatory Gallery and Terrace, and unpaid outdoor space south of the building.
  * There are indoor seating areas throughout the museum. Ask staff for help finding one that suits your needs.
  * Get a hand-stamp—to allow for exit and re-entry—and take a break (or more) outside.
