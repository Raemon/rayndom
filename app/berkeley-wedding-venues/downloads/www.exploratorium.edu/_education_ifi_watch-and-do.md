# Watch and Do Science

Watch and Do Science

#### Explore and investigate phenomena using videos and easy-to-find materials

Set the stage to spark delight, discovery, and ongoing learning. These six hands-on, phenomena-driven science learning experiences are designed for K–5 teachers to use with their students in virtual or in-person environments, with minimal prep time and common household materials. 

Each experience offers learners English and Spanish versions of an Exploration video providing a hands-on introduction to the topic; an Investigation Video to drive content learning and engagement with science practices; and a set of slides with instructions scaffolding the activity. These scaffolds are aimed at specific grade levels, but the activities can work at many grade levels and remote learners can be supported by an older sibling or adult. Teachers can download these slides and modify them to suit their own contexts; each activity also provides a written Teacher Support Guide that contains links to all videos, suggestions for how to use the activity, content background on the topic, and connections to science standards, ELA, and math.
