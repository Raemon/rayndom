Glow

Play in the light.

Step into the art and science of light . . . and recharge your winter wonder.

Discover luminous artworks that dazzle and surprise:

  * Play experimental LED dungeon crawlers ([Robin Baumgarten](/exhibits/line-wobbler "Line Wobbler")).
  * Marvel at an optical illusion sculpture that challenges your perception of light and structure ([Tristan Duke](/exhibits/aperture-lucida "Aperture Lucida")).
  * Bask in the glow of an artificial Sun made of moving mirrors ([Jacqueline Hen](/exhibits/ones-sunset-another-ones-sunrise "One’s Sunset Is Another One’s Sunrise")).
  * Be mesmerized by an ever-shifting landscape composed with unique materials and textures ([Akiko Nakayama](/exhibits/thawing "The Thawing of . . .")).
  * Turn your shadows into stars in a glittering constellation ([Maja Petrić](/exhibits/star-filled-void "Star-Filled Void")).
  * Bliss out as shimmering sculptures reflect and refract surrounding light in all the colors of the rainbow ([Martens & Visser](/exhibits/reflecting-holons "Reflecting Holons")).
  * Experience nearly 500 suspended orbs in the form of a breaking ocean wave, brought to life with light and sound ([Squidsoup](/exhibits/wave "Wave")).
  * Wander a sculptural city built from collected objects ([Angela Yuen](/exhibits/dreamer-iv "The Dreamer IV ")).



Still light-curious? Explore color and shadow with more interactive exhibits in Bechtel Gallery 3, including a refresh of our iconic [Sun Painting](/exhibits/sun-painting "Sun Painting"), and enjoy illuminating live programs for both adults and kids.
