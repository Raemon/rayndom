### What our project partners are saying

> “From the beginning, we [Exploratorium and SESI Lab] built this relationship of respect, trust, and indeed a collaboration in which both sides were very willing to listen and build together.”

Agnes Christie Milleris, [SESI Lab](/global/projects/sesi-lab "SESI Lab"), Brasília, Brazil

> “The exhibits designed by the Exploratorium team are all phenomenal…. [We] are overjoyed by our partnership with the Exploratorium. Patients and their families benefit every day, in countless ways—distraction, delight, curiosity, community building, education, and so, so many more! We look forward to the possibility of collaborating in the future.”

Erin Henderson, [**UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital**](/global/projects/ucsf-benioff " UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital"), San Francisco, CA

> "Working with the Exploratorium on the redesign of our interactive gallery, Art Sparks, was an incredibly collaborative process that brought out the best of both institutions. The Exploratorium did a great job designing exhibits that were customized to our needs and created something unique and special that allows our guests to engage with art and each other on a deeper level."

Anne Taylor Brittingham, [Speed Art Museum](/global/projects/speed-art-museum " Speed Art Museum"), Louisville, KY

> “We came to Global Collaborations with a complex situation that involved bringing more than 20 stakeholders together to develop a cohesive vision and mission for environmental education in Lake Tahoe. No easy task, but they were more than up for the challenge. They worked diligently with us to understand our community’s needs, and then managed to get everyone on the same page in terms of vision, mission, and next steps. Working with them was fun and very thought provoking, thanks to their blend of insights, techniques, and creative ideas. They set us on a path for future success.”

Amy R. Berry, Tahoe Fund, Tahoe City, CA

> “We had a short timeline, so the design/build ability of Global Collaborations was particularly attractive, as well as their thoughtful approach to audience engagement…. By working with the Global Collaborations team, we were able to envision and build a world-class museum that now includes approximately 80 new exhibits in five galleries, each themed separately but with experiences that flow from one to another cohesively and logically.”

Diane LaFollette, [Mid-America Science Museum](/global/projects/mid-america-science-museum " Mid-America Science Museum"), Hot Springs, AR

> "We approached Global Collaborations when we first started working on our Science Journal app. The team provided a lot of input on the direction of the app, and they did an amazing job creating flagship educational activities for our website. Thank you so much for helping make Science Journal a success!"

Amit Deutsch, [Google](/global/projects/google-science-journal " Google Science Journal "), San Francisco, CA

> “[The Exploratorium] opened and widened my horizons to see more of what I can do, what my team can do, and what our community in Palestine can do.”

Saja Amro, [A.M. Qattan Foundation](/global/projects/qattan-foundation " A.M. Qattan Foundation"), Ramallah, Palestine
