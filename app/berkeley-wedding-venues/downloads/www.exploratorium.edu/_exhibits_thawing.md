The Thawing of . . .

_The Thawing of . . ._ is a recording of three of Akiko Nakayama’s “Alive Paintings,” the technique she uses to create art through fluid dynamics. She uses water-repellent acrylic paper, Petri dishes, sand, and other materials as a base and then drops or pours ice, oil, and bubbles onto the landscape. Fluids with different viscosities and surface tensions create bubbles and fractal structures. Each performance is unique and accompanied by a musical score.

Music by Eiichi Sawado

About the Artist

Painter Akiko Nakayama depicts the beauty of metamorphosis through installation, photography, and performance. Combining the energy of movement and the vibrancy of colors, she brings images to life. She is interested in “the meeting of two colors that represent the dance of yin and yang.”
