Director's Circle Dinner 2026

#### The Future of Intelligence

Join us for the **2026 Director’s Circle Dinner** , an exciting evening of discovery and conversation focused on the **Future of Intelligence**. 

From billboards to our personal devices, the word “intelligence” is everywhere. The rapid rise of AI invites us to closely examine the concept of intelligence—as well as its relationship to both humanity and technology. 

How do we balance innovation with human-centered values? And how can human qualities such as empathy, creativity, and resilience continue to push the boundaries of technology? 

Dive into these timely questions with our inspiring panel of thinkers and researchers. Featuring **Lan Xuezhao** , entrepreneur and investor, **Surya Ganguli** , associate director of Stanford’s Human-Centered AI Institute, **Megan Taylor** , Exploratorium’s Chief Learning and Teaching Officer, and moderated by cultural anthropologist Dr. **Roberta Katz** , this year’s Director’s Circle Dinner is one you won’t want to miss.
