Christian Gordon has worked in higher education in support of students and faculty for 24 years, on both coasts and in a variety of settings. Most recently Christian led a turnaround effort to rebuild development and alumni relations at Berkeley Social Sciences, UC Berkeley’s largest academic unit, as part of the comprehensive $6B Light the Way Campaign. Light the Way completed as the largest campaign in higher education history, raising over $7.34B. Previously, Christian led the successful campaign for the Simon School of Business as part of the University of Rochester's $1.2B Meliora Campaign. 

Prior to earning a Master’s in Education from Boston University and moving into higher education, Christian worked as the Operations Manager of the LA Kings and LA Lakers practice facility in El Segundo, CA during the Lakers late 90’s “Threepeat”. Since 2020 Christian has served on the Board of Advisors of The Hip Hop Museum, scheduled to open in the Bronx, NY in 2026. He earned a BS from Grand Valley State University, and a Certificate in Professional Fundraising from Boston University. 

Christian enjoys paddleboarding all over the Bay Area, and volunteers in his free time with two Oakland based non profits. Christian lives in Benicia with his wife Lorie and son Ian, and his daughter is a third year student at the University of Washington in Seattle.

_"I am humbled and thrilled to be joining the Exploratorium at such a pivotal time. I look forward to learning from colleagues, and partnering with our leadership to enable the ambitious plans of this unique and indispensable Bay Area institution. I am grateful for the opportunity to join such a dedicated and accomplished team, and look forward to contributing to our shared success."_
