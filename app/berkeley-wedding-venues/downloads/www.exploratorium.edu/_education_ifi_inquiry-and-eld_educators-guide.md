# Educators' Guide for Inquiry-Based Science and English Language Development

A snapshot of what the integration of science and English language development looks like in classrooms and professional development settings.

Science and Language: Learning them Together

## Classroom Strategies for Blending Science and Language

* * *

The Exploratorium's Institute for Inquiry partnered with the Sonoma Valley Unified School District to provide elementary school teachers with a transformative professional development program. This initiative explored innovative approaches to equip teachers with strategies that use science as a powerful context for English language development.

To share the insights from this collaboration, we've created the Educators' Guide for Inquiry-Based Science and English Language Development. 

This guide highlights the thinking and practices that emerged from this partnership, offering a glimpse into how science and language development can be integrated in classrooms and professional development settings.   


##### What’s Included

  
**Conceptual Overview:** An overview of our inquiry-based approach, including key elements like Guiding Principles, Signature Experiences, Essential Supports, Contextualized Mini-Lessons, and a Spiral Model for integrating science and language development.

**Classroom Video Gallery:** Annotated videos showcasing strategies used by two Sonoma Valley teachers to integrate science and language learning.

**Professional Development Summary:** A breakdown of our approach to teacher training, focusing on fostering language development through science.

**Research Study:** Summarizes independent evaluations of the Institute for Inquiry's work with Sonoma Valley teachers, conducted by Inverness Research and the Research Group at the Lawrence Hall of Science.  


Discover practical strategies and insights for creating language-rich, science-focused classrooms.
