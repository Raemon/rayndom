Seeing and Listening Explainer Station

Explainers are stationed throughout the Exploratorium doing structured and open-ended demonstrations. Ask an orange-vested Explainer to help you explore.

**Light Demo**  
Explore all things light! Make a working lightbulb model and play games comparing different unknown light sources.

**Speaker Dissection Demo**  
Tune in to surrounding sounds by experimenting with strings and vibrations, and use electromagnets to build a basic speaker. Learn how to listen with your bones, and explore the workings of the inner ear.

**Cow's Eye Dissection Demo**  
Do cows see color? How does a lens work? Examine the intricate structure of a cow eye to learn about similar structures in our own eyes, as well as some key differences.
