## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This incredible 3,500-acre lakefront ranch** offers a serene, secluded vibe...and a choice of two spectacular event sites to choose from, each with their own unique character: The Willows, an enchanting forested hideaway; and Lake View, a historic waterfront lodge with upscale polish. 
  * **Creekside ceremonies at Lake View embrace a 360-degree view of the Rocky Mountains, while "I do's" at Willows are exchanged in a natural oasis of fragrant spruce trees and mountain vistas.** Both sites have romantic bistro-lit cocktail patios for sunset mingling. Receptions at Lake View's Grand Hall feel relaxed yet sophisticated, with a light hardwood floor; a fireplace; and sliding glass doors for optimal indoor-outdoor flow. Willows' event space recalls a homey Log Cabin, with a soaring cathedral ceiling and picture windows that frame the dramatic landscape.  __
  * **The ranch also boasts authentic Americana cabins with vintage furnishings** that**** can house up to 58 overnight guests, so you can expand your Colorado destination wedding experience into an epic weekend. Your Wedgewood Weddings experts will help orchestrate all the details, from customizing your wedding package to overseeing the celebration. They’ve really got you on this!
