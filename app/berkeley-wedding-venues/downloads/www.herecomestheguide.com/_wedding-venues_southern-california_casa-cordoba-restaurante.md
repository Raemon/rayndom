## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Transport your guests to the breezy Spanish countryside at this award-winning restaurant,** perfectly located in the heart of Melrose. Intimate weddings will find a perfect fit in the diverse event spaces: the inviting Galería, with its leather booths and dynamic artwork; Balcón, an outdoor porch overlooking Hollywood Avenue; and Barcíto, a stylish cocktail and wine bar area.
  * **The al fresco courtyard, Andalucía, is especially magical.** This spacious area exudes a vibrant Spanish charm, with red-tiled flooring, a pretty tiered fountain, and ivy-draped walls adorned with blue flowerpots bursting with color. A clear tented top keeps the breezy, open feel no matter the weather.
  * **Authentic Spanish food is at the heart of things here,** along with a beverage program that highlights handcrafted mezcal cocktails and wines from Rioja and Ribera del Duero. Delectable tapas have a notably Andalusian flair, and the paellas are made from scratch, prepared in a classic paella pan. Vegan, vegetarian, and gluten-free options abound, so whatever your preference or taste, they're surely be something to whet your appetite.
