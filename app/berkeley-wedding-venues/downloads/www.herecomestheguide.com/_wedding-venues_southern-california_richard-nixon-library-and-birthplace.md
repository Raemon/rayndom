## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Set on nine acres of serene gardens and classically styled buildings,** this is much more than a presidential birthplace—it's a jaw-dropping setting for celebrations of all kinds. A long reflecting pool is bordered by flower beds blooming with color year-round, and the terraced areas of the formal gardens are interspersed with manicured deep green lawns. 
  * **A delicate, steepled white gazebo at the heart of the property** is a lovely spot to exchange vows (Tricia Nixon would agree—it's the same structure used for her 1971 wedding in the White House Rose Garden). After the ceremony, guests can sip champagne beside the sparkling pool or explore the Library's exhibits while you discover endless photo backdrops amid the meticulously landscaped grounds and colonnaded walkways.
  * **Dine beneath a trio of exquisite crystal chandeliers** suspended from the twenty-foot ceiling of the main reception hall, a stunning replica of the White House East Room. Great attention has been paid to every detail: intricate plasterwork and molding throughout, formally draped floor-to-ceiling windows, decorative fireplaces; and a gleaming parquet floor.
