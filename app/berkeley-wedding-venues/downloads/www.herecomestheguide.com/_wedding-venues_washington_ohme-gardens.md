## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **These breathtaking seasonal public gardens** sit on a bluff overlooking the Columbia River and the Cascade Mountains, and offer acres of lushly landscaped grounds with towering groves of trees, a pond, waterfall, dramatic rock formations, and sprawling open spaces.
  * **Celebrations are held in a lawn clearing,** surrounded by soaring cedar, fir, and spruce trees. There’s ample space for all phases of your celebration, and the views of the river valley and mountains are truly spectacular.
  * **Your rental fees include access to the gardens for your guests,** and they may arrive early in order to explore. There are two tents available for rental in the event of rain, and your dance floor, arbor, lights, and sound system are all included in your package.
