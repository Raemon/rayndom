## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Serenity and opulence await behind the gates** of this 53-acre ranch just an hour from Houston. With stately architecture and grounds of rolling meadows, ancient oaks, and a private lake, it’s an ideal choice for an elegant countryside wedding with all the modern conveniences. 
  * **A romantic stone walking path leads to your lakeside ceremony** beneath a quaint white Victorian gazebo. After games and cocktails on the sprawling lawn, move to the custom pavilion, a stunning indoor/outdoor venue nestled beside a vineyard. 
  * **You may rent the entire manor house for the weekend,** housing up to 19 guests in its comfortable rooms. Designed for entertaining, it features a grand chef’s kitchen, large, inviting communal areas, a dedicated children’s space, and a pool.
