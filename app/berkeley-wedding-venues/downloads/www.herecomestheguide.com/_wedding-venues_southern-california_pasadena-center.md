  * **Innovation and inspiration reign at this spectacular boutique venue,** located just 10 minutes from the heart of Los Angeles. You'll impress your guests as soon as they arrive, with a wonderful view of City Hall and the San Gabriel Mountains from an expansive tiled plaza that's perfect for perfect for a ceremony, an al fresco cocktail reception, or a convenient valet drop-off before moving inside for the main festivities.
  * **The 25,000-square-foot Grand Ballroom—the largest in the San Gabriel Valley** —can be divided into 10 separate sections to comfortably accommodate an intimate gathering or a grand gala for over 1,000. Its neutral, modern interior is a blank canvas on which you can paint your own vision, and an adjacent lobby adds a glamorous touch, with a sparkling terrazzo floor and artistic, freeform chandeliers.
