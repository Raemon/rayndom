## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **The two-story historic home (c. 1850) is as charming as it gets** , with a gracious square-columned wraparound porch, widow's walk, and impeccably manicured garden grounds. 
  * **Exchange vows in the pretty white gazebo** , as your guests look on from chairs set on the shady lawn. Continue the celebration in the gardens (there's plenty of room for a tent on the lawn), or in the home's lovely banquet room. 
  * **Your rental fees help support the Marietta Council of Garden Clubs** , a non-profit organization whose members act as stewards of this historic property. Their mission includes the promotion of the study of horticulture, encouraging civic beautification and conservation, and the protection of native trees, wildflowers, and birds.
