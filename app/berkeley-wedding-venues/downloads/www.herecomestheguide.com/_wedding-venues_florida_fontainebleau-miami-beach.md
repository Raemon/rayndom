## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This iconic Miami Beach resort feels like a scene from a vintage film—** sleek white architecture, swaying palms, and the Atlantic just steps away set the stage for a wedding that’s equal parts glamor and getaway.
  * **Ceremonies often take place on the Ocean Lawn,** where the ocean stretches behind you and the breeze moves through the palms, or in Glimmer, a chic indoor space with floor-to-ceiling windows and access to its own oceanview terrace. Receptions flow easily from these spaces into adjoining salons and terraces, giving you room to mix cocktails with sea air and sunset views.
  * **The team knows how to throw a full weekend celebration,** from custom menus and day-of coordination to a wedding-night suite and that signature cake crafted by their award-winning pastry chef. Guests can dip into beachside cabanas, linger over brunch, or simply wander the resort’s stylish corners. Once you arrive, you won’t want to leave!
