## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **It's an ultra-cool, loft-style space with a great Uptown location** that allows easy access for both locals and travelers, plus plenty of bars, eateries, and hotels within walking distance.
  * **Exposed brick and rich wood floors honor the building's history** , while contemporary lighting and eclectic artwork keep things fresh and modern. Festivities can span the entire building—there are two hospitality suites to get ready in, an outdoor patio, a lower-level cocktail room, and an elevator for easy access to the second floor.
  * **The technology's up-to-the-minute, too, with an HD projector** , 110-inch retractable screen, a sound system compatible with all Apple devices, and high-speed WiFi (social media posting will be a breeze, so you better settle on that catchy hashtag!)
