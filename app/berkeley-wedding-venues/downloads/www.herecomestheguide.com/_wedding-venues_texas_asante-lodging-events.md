## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Spend the whole weekend at this breathtaking resort,** surrounded by majestic oaks, verdant lawns, and bountiful blooms. There's enough lodging for 34 of your favorite people to stay on-site with you Friday through Sunday, meaning more time for celebrating and less time spent rushing around.
  * **Their pretty ceremony meadow (called "Moja"— the Swahili word for uniting two into one)** features a gorgeous, 15-foot wrought-iron arch that can be draped in fabric or flowers, and adorned with an iron chandelier. 
  * **After your vows, you'll celebrate on the lovely Grand Lawn** or the spacious Concrete Pad, each with its own unique vibe. There are fire pits scattered throughout for light and warmth, and you might even catch a glimpse of the resident African and native wildlife—kudu, gazelle, springbok, egret, and more.
