## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Traditional romance with modern touches:** This sprawling private estate dating back to the 1930s is a charming blend of new and old. In the recently remodeled Rebecca's Garden, you can exchange vows in the impressive white gazebo beneath a stately oak.
  * **Dramatic classical architecture:** Suffused with elegance, Grace Hall features Grecian arches and columns. Inside, there are two separate dressing spaces, and outside there's a three-tiered fountain, pavilion, and courtyard with fireplace.
  * **Photogenic natural settings:** In Micah's Meadow, you can choose from multiple ceremony spots, such as a wooden arbor, a stone stage, and a 100-year-old tree hung with chandeliers. For your reception, the sleekly modern barn includes custom doors that open to allow guests to mingle freely.
