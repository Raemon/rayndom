##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

  * **The spectacular toes-in-the-sand ceremony site** is just steps from the azure waves of the Pacific. Surrounded by a beloved state park, this dreamy spot is the Goldilocks of beaches—not so popular you’ll feel crowded, but not so small as to be inconvenient.
  * **Primp and prep in the stylish Beach House,** which features plenty of mirrors, vanities, a light-flooded living room with lots of seating for your loved ones, and a sliding glass door that opens directly onto a stamped concrete patio bounded by soft sand.
  * **Its perfect Redondo Beach location** offers plenty of nearby lodging, prime restaurants, and easy access to multiple wonderful reception locations for an easy transition from “I do” to “Let’s party!”.
