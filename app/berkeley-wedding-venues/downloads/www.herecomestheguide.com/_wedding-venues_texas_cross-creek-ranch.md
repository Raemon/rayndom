## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This family-run ranch is just twenty miles from Dallas,** but feels like a secluded rural escape. Its lovely grounds boast mature trees, open meadows, and a gentle creek (complete with its own sweet footbridge!)
  * **A vine-covered pergola beneath a grove of trees****hosts your lawn ceremony,** though you might also opt to exchange vows under the canopy of the open-sided pavilion—both choices are equally picturesque and romantic.
  * **The reception hall has a gracious, rustic-modern vibe,** with polished concrete flooring and accents of weathered wood and corrugated metal. A large stone fireplace keeps the space welcoming and cozy.
