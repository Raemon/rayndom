## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **A peaceful, secluded family farm just a half-hour from Charlotte,** this nature-inspired venue has it all—sweeping meadows and pastures, wooded hideaways, a renovated barn, and a caring staff to help you craft a celebration tailored to you and your partner. 
  * **You'll love the Wedding in the Woods ceremony site,** with its canopy of shade trees, rustic arch that can be decorated or left au natural, and hand-made benches for your guests. Follow with festivities in the elegant, climate-controlled Dove Hall, where an attached deck and garden patio create an awesome indoor/outdoor feel.
  * **Choose to celebrate all weekend long.** The adorable 1901 Farmhouse and Bella Brickhouse are available for overnight stays, offering a convenient home base for your day-of prep, or even as a charming option for an elopement or micro-wedding.
