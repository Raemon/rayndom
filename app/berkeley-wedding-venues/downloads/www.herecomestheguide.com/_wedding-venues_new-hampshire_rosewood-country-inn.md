## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **A perfectly charming traditional New England inn,** this historic gem was originally built in the 1850s but experienced its heyday in at the height of the Gilded Age, when it became a popular destination for Boston-area families seeking summer fun at nearby Lake Sunapee, and winter adventures on Pat’s Peak. 
  * **Twelve acres of artfully manicured grounds** include gardens, walking paths, and a pond with a waterfall, creating a colorful oasis for seasonal outdoor ceremonies. Inside, you’ll find a gracious dining room with a cozy fireplace, which serves as a romantic backdrop for winter weddings. 
  * **The Inn boasts eleven suites of varying sizes** (some large enough to sleep groups and families), with inviting features like gas fireplaces and views of the gardens and mountains. Two pristine vintage cars—a 1928 Model A and a 1966 Mustang—(lovingly nicknamed “Bonnie and Clyde”) are available to for photos, or for a stylish arrival to your celebration.
