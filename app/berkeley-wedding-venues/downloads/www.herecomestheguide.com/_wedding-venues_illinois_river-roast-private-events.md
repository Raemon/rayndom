## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **The spectacular setting, with dazzling city and water views, is like a love letter to Chicago.** Sightlines to the river, bridge and glittering skyscape mean there isn’t a bad seat in any of the six indoor or outdoor event spaces—which of course makes you look fabulous for choosing it.
  * **Historic flourishes abound at this landmark building.** Original, exposed brick walls, tall columns and pressed-tin ceilings add drama inside, while crystal chandeliers and billowy draping on the spacious veranda cast your wedding—and the whole city—in a romantic glow. 
  * **They feature a menu of soul-warming dishes, roasted to perfection…** because wedding guests do not live by views alone. Under the direction of a James Beard Award-winning chef, you’ll savor contemporary American fare paired with artisan wines, local beers and craft cocktails.
