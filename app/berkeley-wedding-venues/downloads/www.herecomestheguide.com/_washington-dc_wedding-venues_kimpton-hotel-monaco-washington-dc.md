## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Situated in fashionable Penn Quarter, this historic 1860 treasure** was built as the general post office for Washington D.C. It's been beautifully restored, and your guests will love its close proximity to local attractions. 
  * **The stunning Paris Ballroom once served as the Postmaster General's library** , and still boasts its original towering inset bookcases, peaked cathedral ceiling, and dramatic skylight.
  * **Plush, quiet guest rooms provide an urban oasis** in the midst of this bustling neighborhood—you'll feel totally pampered by the ultra-luxe bedding and bath products, and they even provide a complimentary yoga mat so you can stretch the stress away.
