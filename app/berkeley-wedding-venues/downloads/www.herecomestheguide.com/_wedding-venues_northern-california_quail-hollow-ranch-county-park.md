## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Embrace a slower pace for your nuptials at this stunning county park,** once a quaint ranch owned by the founders of _Sunset_ magazine. Now, this beloved local treasure encompasses the former home, stables, and outbuildings as well as diverse, ecologically notable habitats, embodying California's unique blend of rich history and distinct natural beauty. 
  * **The charming ranch house is where you'll start your day,** prepping in the comfy dressing room and capturing photos with your wedding party in the light-filled living room or on the rambling porch. Shaded by a spreading live oak, celebrations on the lawn enjoy sweeping views of verdant meadows, woodlands, and tree-shrouded hills rising in the distance.
  * **Your guests will love exploring the extensive trails that criss-cross the park,** passing through riparian, maritime chaparral and mixed evergreen environments (and perhaps catching sight of rare species like the Santa Cruz Wallflower or Western pond turtle). A short walk from the house, you'll find a still pond almost hidden by an ancient red willow—a picture-perfect backdrop every photographer will love.
