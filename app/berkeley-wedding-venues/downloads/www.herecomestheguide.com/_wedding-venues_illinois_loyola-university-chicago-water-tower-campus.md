## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **An abundance of venues across two campuses showcase different settings** , meaning it won't be hard to find the right fit. At the [Lake Shore campus](https://www.herecomestheguide.com/wedding-venues/illinois/loyola-university-chicago), the venues offer historic touches like Art Deco finishing and stained glass windows overlooking the lake; at the Water Tower campus, expect chic contemporary styling and fabulous city views.
  * **Perched on the 15th floor of Corboy Law Center, the light-flooded Kasbeer Hall** is a spectacular setting for your celebration. Outfitted with soaring ceilings and floor-to-ceiling windows that frame fabulous views of the city, this modern ballroom exudes urban elegance. 
  * **Delicious gourmet cuisine is provided by Loyola’s exclusive caterer.** A tasting for four is included in every package, ensuring you'll find the right options for your event; add-ons like late night bites (we're partial to the mini Chicago dogs) are a fun way to personalize your menu.
