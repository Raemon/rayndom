## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This stunning 1890s mansion has been beautifully restored,** and is surrounded by eighteen acres of lush, artfully manicured grounds. It boasts an elegant feel of timelessness, but is only a short drive from Houston.
  * **Whether you opt for a ceremony in the charming gazebo** **or in the light-filled Great Room,** your photos are guaranteed to be lovely. When it’s time to celebrate, shift to the glass-walled Grand Room, offering stunning views of the lake and grounds, or keep things al fresco with a tented affair.
