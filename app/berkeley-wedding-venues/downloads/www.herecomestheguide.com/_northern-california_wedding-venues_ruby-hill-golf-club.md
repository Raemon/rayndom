## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This glorious golf club is nestled in a exclusive private community** surrounded by vineyards and spread over acres of open land. Step through the arched front door into the Grand Lobby and you’re more than a little awestruck by the grand scale and inviting ambiance... and after working with the talented events team and in-house culinary staff, you'll understand how special this place really is.
  * **Two wisteria-covered trellises frame the Circular Patio,** a stunning oval terrace that feels intimate despite the fact that it’s completely open to the sky, the breeze and panoramic vistas. It’s a dreamy spot to exchange vows, and only steps away from the plush dressing lounges, each appointed with complimentary bubbly and hors d’oeuvres to kick off your perfect day.
  * **A regal staircase descends into the Clubhouse Ballroom,** where indoor receptions are held. The sheer grandeur of the space makes you want to sit down to fully appreciate the soaring 40-foot ceiling, custom chandelier, and abundant light streaming in through a multitude of high windows and glass doors. A charming nearby parlor leads onto the Outdoor Parlor Patio, a cozy private oasis hidden behind high hedges.
