## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **In the early 20th century, the 43 lovely acres known as Highland Park** were purchased by Lord and Lady Anderson to create an English-style estate. After half a century as a family retreat and getaway, the park became a beloved community gathering place... and a truly lovely setting for gatherings of all kind.
  * **The vast lawn, spread out under the sun and ringed by towering oaks,** pines and redwoods, is custom-made for a vibrant, garden party wedding. There’s plenty of room for couples to get married in front of a white gazebo at one end, and then walk over to tables set up on the other end for their reception. 
  * **The Highlands House itself, built in the 1930s to replace the original mansion, is also yours to enjoy.** Upstairs, there's a sizable changing room for wedding party prep. On the first floor, we love the Lorenzo Room, a pleasant space with a hardwood floor (great for dancing) and multipaned windows overlooking the garden. The adjacent Garden Room is the coolest in the house, and is considered the best place for the wedding cake.
