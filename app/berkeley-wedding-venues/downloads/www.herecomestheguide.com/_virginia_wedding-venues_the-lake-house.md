## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Airy and modern, this light-filled community space** is right at the edge of Lake Newport. It's at the peaceful center of Reston, a self-contained development just 20 miles from Washington D.C., rich with beautiful parks and open spaces.
  * **The Lakeside Room has a deck that extends over the water** , and it's a wonderful spot for cocktails and photos. The inviting Lake View Room features a gas fireplace and abundant natural light streaming in through the open cathedral ceiling and skylight. You can choose just one room, or rent both for a larger event.
  * **Historic Brown's Chapel is just steps away** , and makes a lovely place for an intimate ceremony. Guests can park in one spot to access both venues, and when you reserve both the chapel and the Lake House, you'll receive a discount on your fee.
