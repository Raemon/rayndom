## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This historic inn, nestled in the heart of quaint South Berwick,** specializes in intimate celebrations with a vintage charm and warm Maine-style hospitality. Two plush suites are ideal lodgings for the couple and wedding party, each with elegant décor, a beauty bar, and an electric fireplace. 18 additional rooms welcome your guests, who will love the opportunity to spend a weekend away in such a lovely place.
  * **You’re welcome to rent spaces individually, or opt for a full hotel buyout** to ensure maximum exclusivity. The seasonal Veranda is a lovely setting for al fresco ceremonies, while the airy Sarah Frost Hall is a popular spot for receptions, as is the Parlor, which is adorned with gorgeous historic murals and a roaring fireplace that warms the space in winter. The Bar is a fun option, too, with its stunning hammered tin ceilings, Gothic-style stained windows, and wide-planked floors.
  * **The award-winning bar and dining menu** **from Dufour** means your guests will be talking about the food long after your celebration ends. For couples having an off-site ceremony, the inn welcomes you back for cocktail receptions, making it perfect for those who want a beautiful ceremony elsewhere but stellar hospitality for the party.
