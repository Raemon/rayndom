## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **With its forested surroundings, historic buildings, and peaceful meadows crossed by split-rail fences,** this special spot is a perfect representation of rural Maine beauty. Now a small working farm and B&B-style inn, it offers only a few wedding dates a year, ensuring your experience will be as unique as your love story. 
  * **There are oh-so-many pretty ceremony options,** among them, a birch-encircled pond and a native wild meadow. The barn (which also serves as the Inne’s bespoke restaurant, Tallulah’s) is a vintage dream, with original timber framing, wood floors, romantic Edison lighting, and a charming collection of antique tables and chairs. 
  * **Lodging is available in the restored 1826 farmhouse,** with each of its eight rooms outfitted with period antiques and modern amenities. A wonderful daily breakfast is included, featuring seasonal, hyper-local delicacies.
