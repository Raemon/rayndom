# Useful Tips for Ordering Your Wedding Invitations

## Is the process of ordering your wedding invitations proving to be more complicated than you'd originally thought? Never fear!

[Hyegraph Invitations and Calligraphy](https://www.hyegraph.com/)

  


## We've put together our top tips for ordering your invites:

  * Ordering your invitations over the phone increases the possibility of mistakes, so order in person if possible. If you order your invitations from an online company, make sure your contract states that they will correct mistakes they make for free.
  * Insist on getting a proof. Have at least two other people review all your proofs before you sign off on them—it’s amazing what a fresh pair of eyes will see!
  * If ordering online, remember that color resolution can vary drastically between computers. The best way to guarantee the exact color you want is to ask that a sample be snail mailed to you.
  * Order 20–30 extra save-the-dates and/or invitations with envelopes in case you have to add to the guest list or you make a mistake when assembling or addressing the envelopes.
  * Save-the-date cards should be sent out 6–9 months prior to your wedding.
  * Invitations should be sent out 6–9 weeks prior to your wedding.
  * Consider working with one stationer or graphic designer for all of your printed materials. She’ll guide you in making sure all of the components convey a consistent design concept. Not that they have to be identical, but as Joyce Scardina Becker observes in [Countdown to Your Perfect Wedding,](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312348452?ie=UTF8&tag=hereccom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0312348452 "Countdown to Your Perfect Wedding,") “It’s like making a fashion statement: All of the accessories in your wardrobe should coordinate and fit together nicely.”
  * To [Evite](http://www.evite.com/ "Evite") or not to Evite? For the main event, even we progressives at Here Comes The Guide come down on the side of tradition and say go with real paper and snail mail—even if your budget determines that you have to DIY. However, if your overall wedding style is relaxed and casual, then we think Evites are fine for the supporting events, such as your Bachelorette Party. We like Evite’s built-in RSVP system and creative style options.
