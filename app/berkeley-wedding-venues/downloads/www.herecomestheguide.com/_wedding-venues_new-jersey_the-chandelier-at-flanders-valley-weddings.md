## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Their white gazebo makes a striking spot to exchange vows** , with the rolling hills of Morris County in the background. In fact, the venue is next to a gently flowing stream and a 200-acre farm, and across the way from a golf course, so there are are gorgeous views in every direction.
  * **The main clubhouse has undergone an impressive renovation** , and boasts a dramatic porte-cochère, expanded lobby entrance, and two graceful banquet rooms featuring opulent Austrian crystal chandeliers.
  * **You'll receive expert guidance from their caring planning team** , who delight in treating each couple as if they were family. Only one event is held per day, so you'll have total privacy and the full attention of the gracious staff.
