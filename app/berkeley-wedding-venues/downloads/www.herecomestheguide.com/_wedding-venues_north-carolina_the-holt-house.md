## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This stately Greek Revival home makes a handsome impression,** with its bright white siding and soaring columned portico entry. Right on Lexington’s historic Main Street, it’s just steps away from downtown’s shops, bars, and restaurants. 
  * **Over an acre of finely maintained grounds offer plenty of room for large outdoor celebrations,** and the home itself is ideally suited to intimate affairs. We particularly love the romantic Grand Parlor, with its opulent windows, bountiful natural light, and graceful millwork. 
  * **Rent the entire manor for the weekend** to enjoy the full charm of this historic property. With three bedrooms, three baths, and welcoming gathering spaces, it's a wonderful place to spend time together, and also serves a perfect prep space for the big day.
