## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Their turn-of-the-century steeple-topped chapel** is a picture-perfect ceremony site. With walls of multipaned windows and French doors opening to a stone patio, it feels like a Victorian greenhouse in the middle of a garden. 
  * ****Warm and experienced staff are by your side every step of the way.** **From connecting you to the best local vendors to ensuring your big day runs smoothly, the managers of this women-owned business know weddings— and they love love!
  * **The lodge's exterior may have a rustic look, but you'll still be pampered.** Make an appointment at the spa, or stay overnight in one of their cabins and arrange to have champagne, chocolate-covered strawberries, and even rose petals waiting for you.
