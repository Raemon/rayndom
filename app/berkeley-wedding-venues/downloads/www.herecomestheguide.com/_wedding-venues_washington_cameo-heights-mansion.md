## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Overlooking the Walla Walla River, this mansion/B &B sits on 400 scenic acres.** Your outdoor ceremony offers views of rolling hills, fields and orchards—plus great vineyard photos. Or, say "I do" indoors, with a dramatic entry down the curved staircase.
  * **Celebrate in the large central courtyard, with dinner and dancing under the stars.** Add billowy draping and chandeliers to amp up the romance. If cozy elegance is more your style, try the private dining room with its coffered ceiling, wainscoting, and fireplace.
  * **You can expect to be pampered in their serene spa and seven gorgeous suites.** There's also a waterfall-filled pool, driving range, intimate movie theater, and library for your pleasure. And, of course, great food paired with their signature wines.
