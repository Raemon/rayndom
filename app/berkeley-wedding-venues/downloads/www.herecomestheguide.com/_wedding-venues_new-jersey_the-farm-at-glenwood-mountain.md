## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This 170-acre family farm in the northern New Jersey mountains** is charming and picture-perfect, with beautiful natural indoor and outdoor spaces that feel welcoming, rustic, and festive.
  * **The Herb Garden is a visitor favorite** with its pretty raised beds planted with bountiful aromatics and vegetables. Or, opt for a ceremony in the spacious pasture overlooking the resident animals, followed by dinner and dancing in the romantic, cathedral-ceilinged Barn.
  * **Your catering is provided on-site, using all-natural, non-GMO, and organic** ingredients grown and raised right on the farm. Menus highlight seasonal vegetables and herbs, along with Glenwood Mountain’s own pasture-raised and grass-fed meats.
