## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Nestled in the quiet woods of the Appalachian foothills** , this simple, intimate chapel brings the outdoors inside, with floor-to-ceiling windows framing a view of the forest.
  * **Follow your vows with a celebration in the cozy reception room** , with its peaked ceiling and inviting fireplace, or dine al fresco under the trees or beneath a tent. There’s also a well-appointed dressing suite, complete with private bathroom.
  * **Feel free to use Juliette Chapel’s list of trusted vendors** , or you can opt to “DIY” any aspect of your event.
