## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Ideally situated in the Loyal Valley between Fredericksburg and Mason,** this charming B&B serves up Hill Country views for miles, and tranquil, “Zen Ranch” vibes that soothe the mind and soul. 
  * **The quaint Stone Chapel** is a special spot for ceremonies overlooking the pretty grounds, and receptions can take place in the Lunar Courtyard, beneath a giant oak tree, or beside the pool. 
  * **We love the fun, cozy accommodations,** which include romantic suites, a casita perfect for family or friend groups, and the Sheriff’s Office, where you’ll find a whiskey barrel vanity within a vintage jail cell!
