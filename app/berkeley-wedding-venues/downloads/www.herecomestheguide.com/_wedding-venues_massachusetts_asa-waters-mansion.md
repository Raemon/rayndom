## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Dating to the late 1820s,** this lovely Greek Revival mansion was built by gunsmith tycoon Asa Waters II and his wife, using the finest materials available both nationally and globally, which included Italian marble, central American mahogany, and coveted "pumpkin pine" from Maine. With only one event hosted per day, you'll have total privacy...and may even be able to imagine how it might feel to be lord or lady of the manor!
  * **With its lush grounds and dramatic columned façade,** the mansion offers fantastic options for outdoor ceremonies and cocktails (we’re quite smitten with the 19th Century-style bandstand). Intimate receptions may be held in the home’s elegantly decorated interior, while large affairs make use of the grand garden tent. 
  * **Your event fees help support the preservation of the mansion.** When, in the mid-1990s, it had fallen into disrepair and faced threats of demolition, a concerned group of local citizens formed a task force to save the once-dazzling home. They succeeded, and their ongoing work is sustained by donations and funds raised by private events.
