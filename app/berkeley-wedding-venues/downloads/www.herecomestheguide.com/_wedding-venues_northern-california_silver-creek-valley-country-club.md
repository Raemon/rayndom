## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Whoever invented the phrase "storybook wedding" must have attended one at this elegant club,** which sits in a beautifully landscaped community anchored by nearby Mount Hamilton and the adjoining foothills. The magic begins from the first steps you take into the expansive foyer, where a dramatic rotunda encircled by gold-tipped wrought iron and capped by a vast domed skylight soars over dual curving staircases.
  * **Say "I do" on a pretty flagstone patio before a majestic waterfall,** which tumbles three levels into a glimmering pool. Or, get married in front of the Cypress Dome with your guests seated on a rolling expanse of lawn, followed by cocktails and mingling on a spacious terracotta patio that shares the club's sweeping vistas.
  * **French doors off the foyer lead to the Yerba Buena Ballroom, the beautiful main event space.** Like the rest of the building's valley-facing side, this unusual crescent-shaped room features a back wall made entirely of glass. Every guest enjoys spectacular views of the championship golf course and the evergreen valley beyond, and at night thousands of twinkling lights from the surrounding homes yield a panorama that's even more dramatic.
