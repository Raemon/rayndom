## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This premier golf club's inviting clubhouse exudes a charming, old-fashioned vibe,** thanks to a covered porch and white wood-and-stone columns. From here, the verdant course spreads out below, encircling a sparkling lake and rustic wooden bridge and continuing on to the tree-dotted hills in the distance.
  * **A wall of greenery provides plenty of privacy in the Wedding Garden,** where you'll exchange vows beneath a wrought-iron arch while seated guests look on from the impeccably manicured lawn. The party starts just steps away on the expansive Conservatory Patio—our favorite place to enjoy the picture-postcard view.
  * **White trusses and ductwork support a high, peaked ceiling in the Conservatory,** lending the room an industrial-chic ambiance. Overhead skylights are covered by shade screens that can be retracted to flood the room with natural light during the day, while bistro lights along the trusses create a dreamy "starry night" effect after sundown.
