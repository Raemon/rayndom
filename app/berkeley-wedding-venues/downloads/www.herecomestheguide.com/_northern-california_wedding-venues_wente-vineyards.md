## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Situated in a pictureseque canyon surrounded by grapevines, sycamore groves and rolling hills** , this vineyard, restaurant, and event center reflects a sense of California history. White Spanish-style stucco buildings are accented with tile roofs and floors; the airy Cresta Blanca Room, with its 15-foot wine barrel ceilings, exemplifies the elegant style.
  * **The lushly landscaped Terrace Lawn evokes a romantic Mediterranean garden****.** It's a lovely spot for your "I do"s, whether framed by the event center's beautiful arched doors or set against a stunning Wine Country landscape topped by cerulean sky. Follow with an al fresco reception here or on the expansive Vineyard Lawn, dining and dancing beneath glowing bistro lights or a stylish peaked tent. 
  * **Welcome your guests with a spectacular dinner and private tasting in the wine cave.** The 1883 vineyard's award-winning and sustainable wines are certainly a highlight of any celebration, and the expert event staff will be happy to help select the perfect pairings for your delectable reception meal.
