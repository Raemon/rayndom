## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Spanning 30 acres of manicured gardens, splashing waterfalls, and a heart-shaped lake,** this exquisite, purpose-built gem encompasses two dreamy venues: Beverly Mansion and Arbor Terrace. With over 40 years of experience hosting phenomenal events, the incredibly coordination and culinary teams work seamlessly together to craft your perfect day.
  * **The sophisticated Beverly Mansion is perched on the edge of the iconic lake,** with elegant glass-panel doors that open onto the formal gardens and lawn. Exchange vows beneath a quaint gazebo or among the palms, then retire to the Victorian-inspired mansion, with its oversized grand staircase, large parlor entry and Swarovski crystal chandeliers adorning the ceiling.
  * **The Arbor Terrace gardens capture the grace and awe of a tropical destination wedding.** Scenic paths among the colorful blooms lead to your secluded ceremony in front of a dramatic, multi-cascade rock waterfall. Receptions follow in the three-sided open-air Arbor Pavilion, which boasts a stone-and-granite bar, outdoor flagstone fireplace, and another stunning multi-tiered waterfall.
