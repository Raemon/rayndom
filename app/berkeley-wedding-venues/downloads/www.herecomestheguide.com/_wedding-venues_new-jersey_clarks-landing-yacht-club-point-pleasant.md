## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **You’ll say “I do” from a stunning glass-enclosed space overlooking the waterfront,** as luxury yachts drift in and out of the peaceful marina and the sun sparkles on the waters. Then, move to the Riverview Room—your dedicated cocktail spot with its cozy, library-inspired vibe.
  * **The second-floor ballroom is beyond gorgeous** with a unique circular hardwood dance floor, tiered chandeliers dripping with Italian crystal, and a wall of enormous windows overlooking the river.
  * **Your stellar in-house culinary team** takes all the guesswork out of planning the food, cocktails, and desserts. The experienced executive chef, who oversees weddings at all three distinctive Beau Truesdale Wedding Venues, delights in customizing menus for each couple.
