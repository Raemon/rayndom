Read More Show Less

  * **Indulge in the relaxed glamour of this exquisite West Palm Beach oasis,** tucked on 22 acres of palms and tropical blooms just minutes from downtown and the pristine beachfront. With its West Indies-inspired architecture, lush surroundings, and gracious, full-service approach, it’s equal parts luxury spa retreat and tranquil garden hideaway.
  * **The Belgrove Ballroom is the hotel’s crown jewel.** Set in its own private wing,**** it's**** a light-filled space with a 19-foot ceiling, glimmering chandeliers, and large windows that frame views of the tranquil pool. The adjacent Terrace, a plush lawn surrounded by tropical greenery, is a lovely open-air setting for pre-dinner cocktails.
  * **The expert events team will help curate every detail of your celebration,** whether you’re hosting an intimate elopement or a weekend-long destination wedding. From booking luxurious spa treatments for the wedding party, to hosting sun-kissed welcome cocktails on the Event Lawn, to crafting elevated menus foodies will love—the whole process feels effortless and easy…as it should be!
