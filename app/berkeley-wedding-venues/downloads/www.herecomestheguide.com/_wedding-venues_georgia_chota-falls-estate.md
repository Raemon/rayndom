## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Nestled on 150 magical acres in the North Georgia mountains,** this all-inclusive destination estate lets you choose between saying "I do" at the base of a spectacular 100-foot waterfall framed by vibrant Japanese maples and lush hydrangeas, or in the charming fieldstone Chapel, where the views of the surrounding vineyard and evergreen forest are lovely year-round. 
  * **Say "so long" to stress thanks to their full-service packages,** which are really-and-truly inclusive. The talented events team will take care of all the details, from initial planning and consultations with the creative director to curating a gourmet menu with the in-house chef to selecting custom floral designs and décor that perfectly match your vision.
  * **The weekend experience** **includes luxury accommodations** for up to 40 guests across multiple lodges right on the property, plus their honeymoon Penthouse Suite overlooking the waterfall. The two-day package gives you Friday through Sunday access to the entire estate, so your celebration can include a rehearsal dinner and plenty of time to explore those gorgeous forest trails.
