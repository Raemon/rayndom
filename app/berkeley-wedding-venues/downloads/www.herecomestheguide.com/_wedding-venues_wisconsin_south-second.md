## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Cool, open, and urban-chic,** this flexible venue in the heart of Milwaukee’s Walker’s Point neighborhood offers both indoor and outdoor areas that can be adapted to fit virtually any wedding style.
  * **The interior is the height of industrial glam,** with a soaring, exposed-ductwork ceiling, vintage-inspired lighting, polished concrete flooring, and a mezzanine level that can be outfitted with games or lounge seating.
  * **Outside, you’ll find a spacious courtyard with its own bar,** reclaimed wood fencing, strings of bistro lights, and balcony that overlooks the entire space. Glass roll-up doors allow seamless access to the main hall for awesome flow.
