## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **They have some really beautiful venue options.** Choose an elegant ballroom or salon…or maybe a spectacular outdoor spot by one of the resort’s sparkling pools…or in the shade of willow trees overlooking the golf course.
  * **Packages start with the basics, but are easily customized.** One “per guest” base price gets you everything you’ll need (and then some), including bar service, passed hors d’oeuvres, dinner, cake, and even a honeymoon suite. The resort offers some great add-ons, too, like rehearsal dinners, luncheons, golf outings, and full pampering packages at Salamander Spa.
  * **There’s a huge array of accommodation styles** , from standard hotel rooms to house-sized vacation rentals—all with easy access to the resort’s amazing amenities and activities. This makes it simple to create a wedding weekend filled with fun: Guests can play golf or tennis, take nature hikes, or simply lounge by the pools or nearby beaches.
