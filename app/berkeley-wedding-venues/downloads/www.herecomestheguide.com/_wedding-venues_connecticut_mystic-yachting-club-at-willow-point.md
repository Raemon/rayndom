## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Pretty Cape Cod and Arts and Crafts-inspired architecture is the hallmark of this gorgeous club** on the banks of the Mystic River. Enjoy 360-degree water views from its secluded grounds, which offer access to a private dock, perfect for capturing some unforgettable photos.
  * **Inside the two-story clubhouse, you’ll find rich wood accents,** delicate, vintage-style fixtures, a graceful staircase, and abundant natural light streaming in through oversized windows…including an especially beautiful arched window in the second-floor ballroom. A large wraparound deck allows guests to step outside and admire the waterside panorama.
  * **All events are expertly overseen by the pros at Constellation Culinary Group.** They’ll help you execute the wedding of your dreams from start to finish—including crafting menus that highlight seasonal ingredients from local farms and fisheries.
