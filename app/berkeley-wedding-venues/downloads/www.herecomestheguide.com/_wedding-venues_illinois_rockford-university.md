## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Located in the charming city of Rockford** , this beautifully maintained university campus is equidistant from Milwaukee and Chicago, providing a particularly excellent choice for those welcoming guests from both cities.
  * **The Fisher Memorial Chapel's warm, mid-century architecture** is accented by an iconic copper roof, wood-paneled ceilings, and a stunning Baroque pipe organ. You'll love snapping romantic photos amid the lush gardens, and there's an adjacent room for the wedding party to get ready.
