## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **It’s a nature-forward, vintage-chic space** that boasts lovely vistas of the surrounding woodlands and offers a host of awesome amenities, including a large kitchen, two light-filled dressing suites, and a friendly, knowledgeable event staff (whose kind, dedicated assistance may be the best amenity of all!)
  * **Exposed rafters wrapped in twinkle lights** add charm and romance to the beautiful, climate-controlled barn, which also features pretty wood detailing, elegant rustic-chic styling, and doors that slide open to let in gentle breezes and views of the grounds. 
  * **T****here is a well-curated library of décor at your disposal,** with things like antique-style lanterns, cupcake holders, and chalkboard table numbers. They’ve even got a built-in, touch-operated photo booth, complete with silly props—always a huge hit with guests.
