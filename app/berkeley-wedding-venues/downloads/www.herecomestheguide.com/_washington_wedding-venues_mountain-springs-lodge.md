  * **Tucked away in the Cascade Mountains** next to the Bavarian village of Leavenworth, this rustic retreat features spacious and comfortable lodges that can accommodate you and your guests for a lovely getaway.
  * **Gorgeous outdoor ceremony settings** allow you to exchange vows beside a charming pond in Ponderosa Meadow, among towering trees in Aspengrove, or even in the snow during the winter (complete with horse-drawn sleigh ride!).
  * **Special packages for elopements and intimate weddings** include a dressing suite, two hours of event photography, a bouquet and boutonnière, an officiant, and dinner prepared by the Mountain Springs chef.
