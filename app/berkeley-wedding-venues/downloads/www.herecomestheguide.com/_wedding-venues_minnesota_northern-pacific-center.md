## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Built over 150 years ago** as a repair station for the burgeoning Northern Pacific Railroad, this fascinating campus has been reimagined as a mixed-use historic estate. Its handsome buildings and grounds now house shops, dining, offices, and truly unparalleled celebration venues. 
  * **A healthy dose of glam** has been infused into each of the vintage industrial spaces: original features like exposed brick, steel frameworking, preserved train tracks, and dramatic arched windows mingle with captivating, luxe details like glittering crystal chandeliers, swags of fairy lights, and graceful swaths of fabric. 
  * **Two distinctly designed dressing suites** are available for use throughout your day. Each is spacious and filled with natural light for excellent photos; Le Lier offers a timelessly elegant atmosphere, while Lincoln Lounge is modern and festive, with mid-century modern styling, a shuffleboard table, and an attached deck overlooking the grounds.
