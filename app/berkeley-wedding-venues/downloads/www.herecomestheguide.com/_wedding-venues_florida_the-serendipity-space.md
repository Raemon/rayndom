## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **With its lush rural setting,** this secluded venue provides a peaceful, quiet escape for intimate gatherings, while its convenient location (tucked right between Orlando and Tampa) provides ease for both locals and travelers. 
  * **A large lawn with unobstructed countryside views makes a lovely spot for vows** and open-air games and cocktails. For your reception, there’s a modern, pavilion-style pole barn whose elevated perch allows for more sweeping vistas. 
  * **In-house DJ services are provided** by G Clef Productions. With thousands of weddings under their belts, they know how to get the party started…and keep it going strong!
