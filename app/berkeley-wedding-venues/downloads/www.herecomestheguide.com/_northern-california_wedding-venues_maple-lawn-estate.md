## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This grand estate, a rambling Victorian built with 19th-century mining riches,** once played host to some of the area's most illustrious social and civic soirees. Today, it remains a magical setting for gracious events: in addition to the landscaped grounds, there's the airy Solarium, the clubby Drake's Bar, and the regal Boyd Banquet Room, where ornate original features evoke the venue's storied past.
  * **The Magnolia Terrace is a jewel of a garden, tucked behind an ornate iron gate** to the side of the mansion. A profusion of colorful blooming hedges lead towards a lush lawn, surrounded on three sides by mature magnolia and camellia trees. You'll process down a wide brick pathway adorned with two multi-tiered fountains towards neoclassical arch—a spectacular spot for your "I do"s.
  * **After vows are exchanged, join your guests on the adjacent terrace for a celebratory glass of bubbly.** Slightly elevated and separated from the grass by box hedges and flower-filled urns, this shady spot is perfect for enjoying cocktails and hors d'oeuvres. Then dinner is served at tables on the lawn, followed by dancing back on the terrace under the twinkle-lit canopy.
