## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Housed in a 150 year-old church, this thriving cultural arts and event center** sits just west of Boston, tucked away in charming Maynard and surrounded by its historic downtown district.
  * **Dazzling stained glass windows, a soaring cove ceiling,** and blond plank flooring ensure the space feels light and airy. There’s an elevated stage for ceremonies and music, and the open floor plan allows ample room for dancing.
  * **A vintage-inspired speakeasy provides a cool, loungey spot** for wedding guests to grab a local brew or custom cocktail, and there’s even an additional suite where you can slip away to freshen up or grab a quiet moment with your partner.
