## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This romantic private estate encompasses 4 acres of lush gardens, lawns and mature shade trees** , accented with chateau-style architectural details (think charming balconies and wrought-iron entry gates.) The vintage-style manor house has been recently renovated with luxury fixtures and contemporary flair.
  * **So much sparkle:** a stately fountain splashes alongside a serene blue pool; bistro and twinkle lights embellish a bricked terrace; and dramatic crystal chandeliers convey a sense of grand occasion.
  * **You’ll have exclusive use of the swanky reception areas like the garden pavilion,** and your choice of six picturesque ceremony sites. (Our favorite photo op is the statement staircase in the mansion foyer!)
