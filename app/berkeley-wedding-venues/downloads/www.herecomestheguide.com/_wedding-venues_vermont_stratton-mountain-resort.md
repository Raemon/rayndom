## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This gorgeous Vermont getaway is big on alpine charm.** It's home to a sweet central village, inviting lodging, and loads of activities. From its breathtaking peak, you can gaze across mountain ranges that span four states!
  * **Every ceremony site is just dreamy,** from the mountainside Chapel of the Snows, to the sweeping Vermont Commons, to the stunning Summit Deck, accessed by an unforgettable gondola ride.
  * **Your rustic-chic reception options are just as fabulous—** we're especially in love with the timber-framed Stratton Mountain Club, and the stunning Great Room, with its cozy stone fireplaces and outdoor terrace.
