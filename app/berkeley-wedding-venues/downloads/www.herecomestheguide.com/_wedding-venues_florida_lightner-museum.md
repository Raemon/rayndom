## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This stunning gem began life as the Hotel Alcazar in 1888,** and has hosted some of St. Augustine's most memorable events for over 130 years. 
  * **The Historic Pool is a sight to behold.** Once the the world's largest indoor swimming pool, it now serves as an incredible "sunken" ballroom surrounded by a three-story balcony—an off-the-charts "wow factor".
  * **Host cocktails in the majestic Grand Lobby,** with its crystal chandeliers, mosaic tile flooring, and dramatic arched windows. From here, guests can explore the courtyards, which are home to manicured gardens and a stone footbridge spanning a tranquil koi pond.
