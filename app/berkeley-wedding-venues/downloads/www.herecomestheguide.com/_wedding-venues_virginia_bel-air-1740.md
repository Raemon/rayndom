## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This 25-acre private estate is situated less than half an hour from D.C.,** but feels like an escape to the English countryside, with rose gardens, meadows, a handsome brick manor house, and walking paths lined with towering cedars. 
  * **Set your ceremony on the lush grounds, or on the all-season covered patio,** which can also host an al fresco cocktail hour. Adjacent to the patio is a spacious lawn with paved walkways that lead to cozy fire pit seating. 
  * **The custom-built reception hall boasts sleek, modern farmhouse styling,** with an ivory and black color palette, lots of oversized windows, and a vaulted ceiling draped with strings of bistro lights and ornately scrolled candelabra chandeliers.
