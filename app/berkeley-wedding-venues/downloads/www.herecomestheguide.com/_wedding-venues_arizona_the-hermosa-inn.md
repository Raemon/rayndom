## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Once the private hideaway of lauded painter Lon Megargee,** the “dean of cowboy artists”, this secluded turn-of-the-century oasis sits at the foot of Camelback Mountain, but is just five minutes outside Scottsdale and fifteen minutes from Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport.
  * **Colorful flower gardens, lush native plants,** and shady pathways create boundless gorgeous photo opportunities. Intimate gathering spaces feature historic Southwestern architecture—think warm adobe and hearty, rough-hewn beams, and walls adorned with Megargee’s works—and open-air patios that ensure you can savor the Arizona sunsets and stars.
  * **Guests may never want to leave their plush rooms and casitas,** which boast inviting modern-Southwest design and top-of-the-line amenities. With 43 rooms on site, there’s ample space for everyone.
