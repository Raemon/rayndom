## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Breathtaking views and impeccable service define this elegant New Jersey venue,** perched on a clifftop overlooking the Hudson River and the iconic New York City skyline. Thanks to expansive, dynamic event spaces and an experienced crew of in-house coordinators, it's especially well-suited to grand East and South Asian, Middle Eastern, African, Muslim, and Jewish weddings, as well as other large celebrations.
  * **Couples begin their day in the luxurious dressing suites before making their grand entrance** onto the sweeping riverfront lawn to exchange vows against the city skyline. Receptions follow in the stunning ballroom—as the sun sets and the chandeliers begin to glow, the twinkling light radiates off the reflective fixtures and finishes to create a magical, romantic atmosphere for dancing into the night.
  * **The dedicated events team understand that a wedding is an experience, not just a single moment,** so they'll work closely with you to craft a gathering that perfectly fits your vision, tastes, and religious requirements. Whether you enjoy the beautifully prepared in-house cuisine, or opt to work with a fabulous culinary partner for your kosher, Indian, or multicultural menu, every element is coordinated with flexibility, joy, and gracious hospitality.
