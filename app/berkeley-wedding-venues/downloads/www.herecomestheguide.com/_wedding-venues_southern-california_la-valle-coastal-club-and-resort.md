## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Highlighted by a refined clubhouse with a cupola and clocktower,** this private country club exudes the classic elegance of an equestrian estate. It's also a full-service resort, boasting 68 stylish guest rooms and a plush spa & fitness center, turning your celebration into an indulgent getaway for your lucky guests.
  * **Two slender palms, their trunks nearly touching as they rise to the sky, frame your "I do"s** on the lovely lawn. Nearby, a raised patio is warmed by fire pits and tiki lights—toast your nuptials against panoramic views that encompass stands of oak, palm and pepper trees and acres of manicured fairways.
  * **Dinner and dancing follow in the large ballroom,** where elegant, milk-glass chandeliers hang from the vaulted ceiling and decorative white molding adds a nice contrast. And, if you just don’t want the evening to end after the party winds down, you’re welcome to head on over to the Members Bar for an after-hours nightcap.
