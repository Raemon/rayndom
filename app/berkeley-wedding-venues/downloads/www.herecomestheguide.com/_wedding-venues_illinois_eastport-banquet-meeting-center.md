## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **It's a charming nautical-style venue with an enviable river's-edge setting.** The beautiful views of the Illinois River offer tranquil tableaus, while Peoria's dynamic skyline—all lit up at night—makes an exciting backdrop for your affair.
  * **Enjoy a ceremony on the wooden deck that juts over the water** as guests watch from the upper deck, then host an outdoor picnic overlooking the harbor's yachts.
  * **The indoor facility is a nice balance of traditional and contemporary** , with lots of large, wood-framed windows so you won't miss a bit of those stunning vistas. Let their event and banquet staff help you plan and and make sure everything goes smoothly.
