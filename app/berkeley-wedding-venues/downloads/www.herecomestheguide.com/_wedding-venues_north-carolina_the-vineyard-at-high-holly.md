## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Set on the verdant Highland Plateau in the Blue Ridge Mountains,** this picturesque vineyard stretches across 30 acres of gently rolling hills that house an award-winning dahlia garden, peaceful walking trails, a fishing pond, and a waterfall. Enjoy daily wine tastings or a tennis match during your stay. 
  * **Wed in a meadow surrounded by lush trees and flowers,** then follow with bocce ball and cocktails on the lawn. Their lovely, rustic-chic event pavilion makes a wonderful spot for your reception and allows for perfect indoor/outdoor flow. 
  * **The charming studio-style Homestead Cottage** is the sweetest place for your honeymoon night, with its sweet porch and cozy double-sided fireplace. Additional overnight guests can be accommodated in five additional cottages and the beautifully restored Farmhouse for 52 guests. A true destination wedding spot!
