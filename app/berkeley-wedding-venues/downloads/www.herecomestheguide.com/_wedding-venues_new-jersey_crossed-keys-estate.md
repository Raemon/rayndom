## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **It’s a lovely 18th-century home and 30+-acre estate just 75 minutes from Manhattan.** You arrive via a treelined drive that leads you to lush meadows, gardens, a historic Estate home, and light-flooded, modern event spaces.
  * **Outdoor ceremonies are set** **among the fragrant blooms of the English Garden**. Cocktail hour is lovely in the glass-walled Conservatory; when it's time to dine and dance, an enclosed passageway leads to the Farmhouse, with its soaring, gambrel-style ceilings, exposed dark wood beams, and floor-to-ceiling window framing spectacular views of the surrounding landscape.
  * **Wedding party prep is equally luxurious.** The 1790s Playhouse has been reimagined as a light-flooded dressing suite, all set for you with complimentary champagne and light bites. The other ready room, the Pequest Parlor, in the 18th-century Estate house, is equally stunning, with a private deck, putting green, and their own collection of sips and snacks.
