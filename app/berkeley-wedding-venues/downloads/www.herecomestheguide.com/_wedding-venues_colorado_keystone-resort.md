## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Set in the historic mountain town of Keystone**(only an hour from Denver), this lovely resort boasts family-friendly, laid back vibes, year-round activities for all interests, loads of places to stay, and three distinct venues, each with its own unique charm. 
  * **Keystone Ranch was once a 1930s homestead,** and now features classic country club-style spaces overlooking the golf course. Ski Tip Lodge, with its traditional Swiss design, is a cozy spot for intimate celebrations, and Timber Ridge impresses with its cathedral ceilings, towering fireplace, and views of the Gore and Tenmile Ranges. 
  * **Feeling a little overwhelmed by all your incredible options?** Not to worry—the wedding experts at Vail Resorts (who operate this, and over 40 desirable mountain properties) are absolute stars at helping you navigate it all, whether it’s finding the perfect venue, choosing a place for your rehearsal dinner, or coordinating group lodging.
