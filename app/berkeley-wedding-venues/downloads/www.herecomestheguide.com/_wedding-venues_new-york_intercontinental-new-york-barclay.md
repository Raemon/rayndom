## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Timelessly romantic with a distinct New York charm,** this historic hotel boasts effortlessly elegant event spaces and an awesome Midtown location that's convenient for locals and visitors alike. All-inclusive packages make planning easy, with delectable menus custom-crafted to fit your unique tastes and preferences.
  * **Opulent celebration spots include the Grand or Empire Ballrooms,** with their classic, subtle color palettes, stunning lighting, and amply-sized dance floors. We recommend starting the party with cocktails in the Grand Foyer, a dramatic space adorned with a gorgeous chandelier centerpiece that sparkles with 8,000 crystals.
  * **Looking for something intimate and truly unique?** Consider an elopement on the Penthouse Terrace, where you'll exchange vows before a lovely European-inspired tiled fountain with the iconic Chrysler Building as your unforgettable backdrop.
