## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **The pretty 1905 Victorian “mini-mansion” at the heart of this secluded property can be rented** for the weekend, sleeping sixteen guests. And that’s just the start: the Greenville-convenient venue also boasts fantastic indoor and outdoor facilities designed for equally fantastic celebrations. 
  * **The event barn is a rustic-modern beauty (with just a touch of glam),** featuring a vaulted ceiling, lots of large windows letting in natural light, an open layout perfect for dining and dancing, and an attached dressing suite. 
  * **An adjacent patio makes an ideal spot for ceremonies,** with a backdrop of towering woodlands just beyond a lush lawn. Strung with strands of romantic bistro lights, the space can be quickly flipped to serve as an al fresco addition to the celebration.
