## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This historic Georgian estate sprawls across 250 acres of rolling meadows,** dotted by mature boxwood, poplar, oak, and maple trees. A working horse farm, it offers countless beautiful photo opportunities and year-round options for indoor and outdoor affairs.
  * **A stunning copper beech tree provides a dramatic backdrop for vows,** as does the private, secluded pond. In the renovated barn, vaulted ceilings, exposed rafters, and wide plank oak floors set the scene for a stylish celebration.
  * **The entire experience exudes a sense of graceful luxury,** from the manicured lawns bounded by charming equestrian fences to the tree-lined drive that leads to the stately manor itself, which is surrounded by foliage and blooms that change with the seasons.
