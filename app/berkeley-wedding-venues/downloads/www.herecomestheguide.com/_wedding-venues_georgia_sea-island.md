## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Its setting is magical:** Situated in the Golden Isles, this historic Forbes Five-Star luxury resort presides over five miles of pristine, private coastline and is surrounded by ancient oaks, picturesque marshland, and three championship 18-hole golf courses.
  * **The ceremony and reception venues are gorgeous:** Exchange vows beneath a canopy of moss-covered oaks while the sun sets behind you, or say "I do" in the enchanting Cloister Chapel or the Spanish Lounge, with its ornate arched windows and oversized fireplace. Then dine and dance in one of their exquisite ballrooms, at an outdoor oceanfront site, or in one of Sea Island's serene wooded and landscaped locations.
  * **You'll enjoy VIP accommodations and amenities:** Stay overnight (or the weekend!) in your choice of The Cloister, The Lodge (with 24-hour butler service), private cottages, or The Inn at Sea Island. And for the ultimate revitalization, treat yourself to some pampering at the resort's Forbes Five-Star rated Spa and Fitness Center.
