## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Savor spectacular unobstructed views of the Shenandoah Valley** from this 160-acre family-run farm and vineyard. You'll exchange vows in an open field beneath a white wooden pergola, or perhaps say "I do" with the stately Jeffersonian mansion as your backdrop.
  * **Following your vows, guests can sip cocktails on the spacious patio** and play lawn games as the sun sets over the Blue Ridge Range and Massanutten Peak. Then, swing open the multiple French doors that lead to the reception hall, and celebrate in elegant Colonial-inspired style.
  * **The primary dressing suite is lovely, with a large hair and makeup station** , velvet settees, a tasteful private bathroom, and double doors that open onto a surrounding patio. There's a great dressing lounge for your other other half, too—it boasts a large screen TV, pool table, and plenty of room to spread out and get comfortable.
