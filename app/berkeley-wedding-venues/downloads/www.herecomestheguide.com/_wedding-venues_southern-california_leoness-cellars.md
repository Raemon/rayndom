## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **With expansive views that encompass acres of lush vines,** along with a top-tier staff, luxurious dressing suites, and generous packages, this elegant winery truly has it all. Intimate, romantic ceremonies are held on a gracious elevated lawn, highlighted by a charming white pergola which frames sprawling views of the vineyard and gently rolling hills beyond.
  * **The welcoming Barrel Room—one of the largest in the region—exemplifies a classic Wine Country vibe.** The barrel-lined walls are charming and photo-ready, and easily fit in with various styles and designs. Opt for a romantic, chiffon-draped look highlighted by the glowing chandeliers, a rustic-chic vibe with plenty of greenery, or a playful disco-inspired party that's all about the dancing.
  * **The diverse collection of in-house wines are absolutely divine,** and reflect the Temecula region's unique characteristics. This results in high quality, delectable selections that range from Cabernet Franc to Viognier to Cinsault Port... each carefully paired with your custom menu.
