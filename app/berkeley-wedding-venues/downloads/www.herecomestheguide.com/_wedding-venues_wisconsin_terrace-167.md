## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Woodsy romance meets rustic charm at this welcoming, family-owned venue** set among the rolling hills of Richfield. Designed and built to be a spectacular setting for celebrations, you’ll find all the important amenities here, from wooden tables & chairs to in-house bartenders, to whiskey barrel fire pits.
  * **Tucked into the trees at the edge of the forest is the pretty, secluded ceremony area,** crafted with natural stone steps, a flagstone aisle, and pretty wooden benches for your loved ones. Two dressing suites are also on hand for the wedding parties, each spacious and outfitted with pretty, eclectic décor.
  * **Roll-up garage doors open to reveal the stylish, industrial-inspired indoor space,** where Edison bulbs and sparkling chandeliers are draped from open-beamed ceilings. One of our favorite features is the custom-built Back Bar, with its floor-to-ceiling brick wall, gleaming ducting, hammered metal detailing, and unique gear-inspired art—it’s a favorite spot for photos.
