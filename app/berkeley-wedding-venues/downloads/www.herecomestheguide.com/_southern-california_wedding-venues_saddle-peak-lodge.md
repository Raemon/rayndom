## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Join the likes of California's iconic cowboys and buzziest Hollywood stars at this intriguing restaurant,** which has a century-long history as a beloved gathering place. With its rough-hewn, tall-timbered interior and authentic Old West décor, the event spaces are warm and elegantly rustic, and the events team (and their incredible partner vendors) are experts at bringing them to vibrant life for your celebration.
  * **Vows are often exchanged on the picturesque and secluded Patio,** with a circular, two-tiered slate rock area that overlooks Santa Monica Mountains' rolling hills and canyons. Dinner and dancing may continue al fresco here, beneath a canopy of pine and eucalyptus trees, or guests can make their way past a burbling waterfall into the Main Dining Room, where a massive stone hearth creates a cozy ambiance.
  * **The jaw-dropping views and gracious surroundings are matched by the exquisite cuisine.** Not only is the food award winning (earning "best-of" honors from the _Los Angeles Times_ and _Conde Nast Traveler,_ as well as the highest ratings from ZAGAT, DiRoNA and Four Diamond AAA), but it's crafted with fresh ingredients—including an extensive selection of exotic meats—and presented with sophistication and care.
