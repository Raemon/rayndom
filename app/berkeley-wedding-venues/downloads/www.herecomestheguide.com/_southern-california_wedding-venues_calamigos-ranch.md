## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Nestled on 130 acres of landscaped gardens, oak groves, and vineyards** in iconic Malibu Wine Country, this luxurious retreat offers four private wedding venues, each with its own unique charm.
  * **From cascading waterfalls to twinkle-lit trees, every setting is storybook-stunning.** Say "I do" beneath the expansive arms of a centuries-old oak, on a verdant lawn framed by lush vines, or before the tumbling waters of a natural stone waterfall. Dining and dancing follow in adjoining reception halls, all of which boast thoughtful amenities and a lovely indoor/outdoor flow.
  * **With decades of experience and a deeply personalized approach** , the talented events team will ensure your wedding is both effortless and unforgettable. One of our favorite perks is the on-site lodging: extend the celebration with a stay at the luxurious Calamigos Guest Ranch.
