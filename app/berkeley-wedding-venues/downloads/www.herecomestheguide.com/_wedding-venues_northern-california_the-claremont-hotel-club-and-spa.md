  * **This brilliant white, castle-like club has been a Bay Area landmark since 1915.** Set high in the Oakland and Berkeley Hills on 22 landscaped acres, it offers one of the most breathtaking views in the region. Conceived as a classic English estate, its timeless architecture, fragrant gardens, and elegant amenities have long made it a sought-after setting for weddings.
  * **Host your entire celebration here, from a rehearsal dinner in the intimate Secret Garden** or colorful Hillary Tenzing Room to a honeymoon in one of the luxurious suites, with a sweeping view of the San Francisco Bay. The light-filled Lanai Room provides a beautiful indoor ceremony space, with an adjoining outdoor balcony boasting picture-perfect backdrops of the city and Claremont grounds.
  * **A variety of ballrooms, each with its own distinctive character,** accommodate gatherings of all sizes across over 20,000 square feet of event space. A true resort, you'll also enjoy their three pools, eight tennis courts, four pickleball courts, and spa, which offers indulgent treatments, including facials, massages, and body treatments, to help you unwind and feel your best on your special day.
