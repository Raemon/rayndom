## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Tucked away in Las Vegas’s bustling Arts District,** this cool, industrial-chic venue is conveniently situated right between Downtown and The Strip, but offers guests access to a fun, vibrant neighborhood all its own.
  * **The interior is a sleek, neutral blank canvas—** whitewashed walls, a towering ceiling with exposed rafters and ductwork, huge vintage-style windows—just waiting for your imagination to make it yours. 
  * **An open floor plan offers ultimate flexibility,** and there’s even a cute attached patio where you can set up an outdoor lounge. Rental packages allow you to choose exactly the amount of time you need, and outside vendors are welcome.
