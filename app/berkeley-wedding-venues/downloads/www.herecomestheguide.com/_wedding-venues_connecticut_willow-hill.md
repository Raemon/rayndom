## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Lush green fields give way to endless forest views** at this special, family-owned event escape. It offers tons of lovely options for celebrations both indoors and out, and is less than 90 minutes from all major surrounding cities. 
  * **Wed in the meadow,** either out among the trees or beneath a chic clear-topped, open-sided tent. Toast the day with sips and games on the lawn, then move the party to the beautiful post-and-beam barn, with its warm wood siding, floor-to-ceiling windows, and traditional sliding doors. 
  * **Host your favorite folks overnight in the 1790s farmhouse,** which sits at the top of the property and boasts five bedrooms, cozy fireplaces, spacious gathering areas, and a pool/patio area that’s also perfect for an al fresco cocktail hour.
