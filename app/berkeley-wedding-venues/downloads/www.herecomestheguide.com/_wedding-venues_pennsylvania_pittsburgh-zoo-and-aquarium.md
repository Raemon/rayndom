## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **The Garden Tent marries elegance and whimsy:** surrounded by lavish foliage and botanical gardens, this expansive peaked tent is outfitted with glowing bistro lights and uplighting for a magical vibe. Its hilltop location, steps from the carousel and train, makes nearby photo ops easy.
  * **Dine next to exotic fish and sip tropical drinks** at the Aquarium. A lush rainforest, waterfalls, and brilliantly colored aquatic life from around the globe make a remarkable backdrop for your reception—and photo memories.
  * **Their packages include** shuttle service from the zoo entrance to the indoor event spaces, food and beverages from _Taste_ catering, tables, chairs, and linens. Plus, you might just get the opportunity to pose with a fuzzy, furry, or slinky creature.
