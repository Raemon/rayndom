## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Cool, contemporary architecture and the unparalleled beauty of the Poconos** make this resort a truly special destination, especially when you add in on-site lodging, fully customizable packages, and an easy-peasy location (it’s only 90 minutes from NYC.)
  * **The dazzling all-glass Wedding Gazebo sits perched above the lake,** offering 360-degree views for ceremonies and intimate receptions. Larger weddings may use the gazebo and its patio for vows and cocktail hour, then move to the tented terrace for a grand celebration. 
  * **Five boho chalet-inspired cabins on the water’s edge** can house five guests each, and they’re super swoon-worthy, with towering glass fronts and high-style interiors. Large groups can take over the dazzling mansion, with its wraparound porch and awesome amenities (we call dibs on the sauna!)
