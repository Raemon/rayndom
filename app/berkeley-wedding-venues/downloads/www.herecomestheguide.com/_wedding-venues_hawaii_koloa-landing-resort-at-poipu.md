## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This award-winning tropical resort on Kauai’s sunny South Shore** wows with lava rock waterfalls, swaying palms, and that signature golden light the area is famous for. The vibe? Relaxed luxury, with nine gorgeous event spaces, versatile packages, and stunning grounds with winding paths through lush gardens and ocean views around every corner.
  * **The Ocean View Lawn is ceremony-ready, with panoramic coastal vistas** and a natural altar of palm trees and sky. Continue al fresco in the Garden, surrounded by fragrant hibiscus, plumeria, and orchid flowers, or transition into the magnificent Koloa Grand Ballroom, where soaring 17-foot-ceilings and large glass doors create a lovely, airy vibe.
  * **The villa-style accommodations invite you and your guests to stay awhile,** each outfitted with full gourmet kitchens and private lanais perfect for a post-party wind-down or a quiet morning coffee. There’s also a plush spa, daily activities, three pools—including one with an infinity edge and swim-through grotto—and beach access just down the walkway.
