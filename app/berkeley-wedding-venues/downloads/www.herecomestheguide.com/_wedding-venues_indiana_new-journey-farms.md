## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **With its expansive lawns, lush landscaping, and swoon-worthy, photo-friendly panoramas,** this contemporary, farm-inspired event space feels far removed from the daily bustle, but its great spot just off I-65 means your guests have plenty of lodging options. 
  * **Exchange vows in a sweeping open field,** where a pretty pergola frames a backdrop of meadows and distant woodlands. It’s an unforgettable view, unobstructed and beautifully serene. 
  * **You’ll love the sleek barn space,** with its stylish split staircase, ample windows letting in tons of light, and lofty, open-raftered cathedral ceiling hung with cool geometric chandeliers.
