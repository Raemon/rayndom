## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Exchange vows on the Hilltop, a velvety lawn perched on a picturesque rise** above the rolling hills of Paso Robles wine country. The spectacular vistas from this spot are quintessential Wine Country, with acres of oak-lined roads, rows of grapevines, and lush walnut groves as far as the eye can see. The nearby Opolo Inn offers plush lodging—it's the perfect home base for a weekend-long wedding retreat.
  * **There's plenty of space here for golden hour photos and cocktails.** When it's time for your reception, invite your guests aboard a tractor shuttle which will transport them down the hill to the beautiful and welcoming Barrel Room. The barrel-lined walls are a pretty backdrop for dining and dancing; a glossy, polished concrete floor reflects the intimate light from the sparkling chandeliers, which are easily adjustable to create your ideal vibe.
  * **Wedding parties prep for the day in two elegant, standalone venues.** With its spacious open-plan design, landscaped exteriors, and massive, Craftsman-style windows, the Vineyard House offers a lovely indoor/outdoor setting; the quaint Barn, with its wood interiors, red tin roof, and adjacent patio, exudes rustic-chic charm.
