## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

  * **It’s a charming working farm,** run by the family who has lived on its land for generations. Just a few minutes outside Lebanon, it boasts pastoral grounds dotted with a collection of picturesque historic buildings.
  * **Wed in a meadow** **beneath the boughs of centuries-old trees,** or with a quaint log cabin as your rustic backdrop. Then, move to the spacious barn, with its soaring ceiling, warm-toned exposed wood, and romantic string lighting, for an unforgettable reception.
