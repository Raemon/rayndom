## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Tucked away in the quiet foothills of Yorba Linda, this gracious club showcases the best views in Orange County:** gently sloping mountains to the east, the wide valley floor spread out below, and the sparkling Pacific beyond. Couples love the all-inclusive packages and personalized attention they receive from the staff here, who are quick to respond to questions and are known for going above and beyond.
  * **Your ceremony will be memorable at The Falls,** a completely private area next to a cascading waterfall and surrounded by spectacular vistas in every direction. Vows are exchanged under a pretty white arbor, which can be draped with flowers or hung with lights, fabric, lanterns—whatever accents you choose to complement your theme.
  * **The Craftsman-inspired clubhouse was designed with entertaining in mind,** boasting a red-tile roof, arched doorways, and twinkle-lit patios perfect for cocktails or late-night dancing. With floor-to-ceiling windows that look out over the lush 18th green, the Lakeview and Valleyview Rooms can serve as intimate reception halls on their own, but may also be combined to create one grand space for larger, more lavish affairs.
