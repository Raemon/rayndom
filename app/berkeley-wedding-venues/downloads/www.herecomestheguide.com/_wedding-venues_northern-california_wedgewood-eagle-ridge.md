## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

About 35 minutes south of San Jose lies Wedgewood Weddings Eagle Ridge, a sophisticated special event facility that offers a dynamic combination of scenic vistas, high-quality amenities and surprising affordability. 

From inside an exclusive gated community high in the hills above the Santa Clara Valley, Eagle Ridge enjoys a sweeping panorama of the tranquil countryside and lush fairways of the neighboring golf course. The impressive driveway is lined with stately palm trees, and as you approach the Clubhouse you're greeted by warm breezes. 

Crisp, manicured hedgerows and a wisteria-entwined veranda accent this graceful, two-story structure, which is done in Monterey Colonial style with white clapboard siding and green shutters. As refreshing as a cool glass of summertime lemonade and quite cheerful any time of year, the Clubhouse effortlessly blends in with its surroundings along with the 100-year-old oaks that shade the landscape. 

Behind the Clubhouse, a great swath of lawn ringed by slender cypress trees serves as a beautiful ceremony site. Large stone urns mark a pavered wedding aisle just begging for rose petals. A stacked flagstone stage topped with a romantic white pergola frames the couple as they say their vows, and friends and family look on with the tree-cloaked hills as a picturesque backdrop. 

Inside, the venue is every bit as charming. In the Lounge, you'll find a freestanding double fireplace of brick and wood; a large marble-and-wood bar; and circular wrought-iron chandeliers hanging from a vaulted, open-beamed ceiling. Guests can relax and sip cocktails in overstuffed leather chairs before moving into the dining room for dinner. And yes, these spaces also have plenty of windows to showcase the fabulous view! 

Though Eagle Ridge is visually stunning, one of its most valuable assets is Wedgewood Weddings' trademark on-site coordination. Their expert staff choreographs all the elements, including customizing their flexible wedding packages to suit your vision. Along with varied and generous menus, the packages offer any combination of invitations, flowers, cake, entertainment and officiant—all of which have been carefully selected for maximum value and satisfaction. 

Relaxed elegance, a gorgeous rural setting, budget-friendly and service-oriented … it's no wonder South Bay wedding couples are escaping to Wedgewood Weddings Eagle Ridge for their dream celebration!
