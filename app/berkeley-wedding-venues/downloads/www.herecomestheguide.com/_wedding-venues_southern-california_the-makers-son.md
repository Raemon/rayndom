## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This unique, historic Wine Country property is a former filling station that’s been impeccably transformed into a rustic-chic indoor/outdoor event venue and working restaurant and bar**. The indoor banquet space features an authentic 1920s service garage with original open-truss high-vaulted ceiling and an intimate Western tavern, both with curated décor and Western-style antiques. 
  * **Beneath the dappled shade of oak trees, the beautifully landscaped and elegantly lit garden** comes with fire pits, a massive stone fireplace and a private tasting bungalow. A built-in stone-and-brick event stage is crowned by a rustic ceremony arbor. 
  * **Customized menus embrace Central Coast cuisine, with seasonal, locally sourced ingredients for elevated comfort dishes** infused with globally inspired flavors. The full-service bar boasts premium spirits handcrafted into signature cocktail inspirations, along with wines, beers and ciders from artisan Central Coastal producers. The experienced event team is dedicated to providing a hassle-free and turn-key celebration experience!
