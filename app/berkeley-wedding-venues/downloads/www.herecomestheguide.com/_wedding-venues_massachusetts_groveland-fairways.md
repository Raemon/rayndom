## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **A former farm, this historic garden estate is now a private event venue boasting scenic views and tons of country charm.** Though it’s located just 34 miles outside of Boston, Groveland Fairways feels like a serene family retreat where your loved ones gather to celebrate your special occasion. 
  * **A vintage home with a quaint wraparound porch adjoins the Terrace Garden, a beautiful greenspace with a lawn, hedges and leafy trees.** A white arbor and trellis, flanked by a pair of evergreens, is such a picturesque place to exchange vows! Another striking ceremony option is in front of a lofty stone fireplace on the Hearthside Patio, a bricked expanse dotted with pretty landscaping. Winter “I Do’s” are sweet and cozy in the Fireside Room, which has its own fireplace. Receptions are held in the welcoming Oakwood Room which features another fireplace, a built-in bar and a large wooden dance floor. _Tip:_ Check out the nearby Merrimack River for romantic photo opps!
  * **Since this venue is brought to you by the experts at Wedgewood Weddings, you can create your wedding vision from their fully customizable, all-inclusive packages.** The caring event team offers plenty of planning support, too, and will help you maximize your value and make the most of all that this unique venue has to offer.
