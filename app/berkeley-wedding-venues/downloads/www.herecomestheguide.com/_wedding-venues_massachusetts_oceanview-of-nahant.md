## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Nestled on a gorgeous stretch of coastline in Nahant Harbor** , this private event center features sweeping views of the Atlantic Ocean. Only one wedding is hosted at a time, which means you'll have exclusive use of all spaces, including the cocktail lounge and dressing suite.
  * **The unforgettable Beach Stone Terrace allows you to exchange vows** with a sparkling waterfront panorama as your backdrop. Guests can then join you in the warm and contemporary grand ballroom, which features floor-to-ceiling windows and custom lighting.
  * **End the night with a Fire Pit Finale** , where your friends and family can gather under the stars to roast marshmallows and send you off. You can also experience your last dance on the beach, listening to your favorite song float over the waves in the glow of the moon.
