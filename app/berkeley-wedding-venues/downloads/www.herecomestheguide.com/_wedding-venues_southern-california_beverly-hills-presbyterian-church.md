## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **A picture-perfect haven of tranquility** nestled in the heart of Beverly Hills’ most glamorous neighborhood, this exquisite church offers a peaceful setting for your big commitment. The multi-level structure centers around a lushly landscaped courtyard: at its top, soaring 68 feet into the air, is the original 1924 steeple, which will chime out in celebration of your marriage after the "I do"s are said.
  * **In the exquisite Main Sanctuary, a 106-foot center aisle** is bounded by gleaming wooden pews on either side, and illuminated by the light cast by wrought-iron candelabras and large devotional stained-glass windows. An equally lovely setting for more intimate weddings, the Chancel's huge circular stained-glass pane window and vintage chandeliers evoke a spiritual calm.
  * **Once vows are exchanged, you and your guests will exit on the iconic Rodeo Drive** before re-entering for a reception in the courtyard, the richly decorated library, or the larger hall with a center dance floor. Before the toasts are said, you'll want to steal away with your photographer to take advantage of the numerous nearby photo ops, including the expansive park across the street.
