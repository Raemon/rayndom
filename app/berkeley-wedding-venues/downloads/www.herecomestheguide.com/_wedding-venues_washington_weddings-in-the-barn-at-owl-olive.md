  * **Set on the verdant banks of the upper Chehalis River,** this historic working farm boasts acres of gardens, pasture, and woodlands, creating a peaceful, nature-focused retreat with endless divine photo ops. 
  * **The 1930s gambrel barn is simply stunning,** with a vaulted, timber-trussed ceiling that soars to 40 feet. The space is illuminated by three oversized chandeliers, as well as twinkle and bistro lights. 
  * **Your package includes a host of thoughtful and fun extras,** including classic lawn games, two private dressing suites that overlook the river, and overnight RV dry camping in the pasture.
