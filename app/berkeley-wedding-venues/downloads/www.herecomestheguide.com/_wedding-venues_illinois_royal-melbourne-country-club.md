## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **With picture-perfect grounds, mature landscaping, water features, romantic walking trails, and footbridges,** this Lake County country club offers a tranquil wedding escape just a quick drive north of Chicago. 
  * **The ceremony garden is so romantic,** with its stately shade trees and view of the lush golf course. In the elegant Grand Ballroom, a semicircle of floor-to-ceiling windows lets in more light and lush vistas, and its attached veranda allows guests to mingle beneath strings of bistro lights. 
  * **Long Grove and its surrounding area offer plenty of lodging options** for out-of-towners, and ride-share services are able to easily access the club. Want to make the most of this special spot? Consider letting your coordinator help organize a custom golf outing for some friendly pre-wedding competition!
