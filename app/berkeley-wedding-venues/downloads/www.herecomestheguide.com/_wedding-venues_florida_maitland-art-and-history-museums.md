## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Designed in 1937 as a winter artists’ colony** by noted artist and architect J. André Smith, this stunning building features hundreds of original sculptural elements created by André Smith and his associates, and is one of few surviving examples of Mayan Revival architecture in the southeastern United States.
  * **There are several gorgeous outdoor spaces** for vows and celebration, but our favorite might be the Mayan Courtyard, which feels like a secret jungle hideaway, with its distinct architecture, hand-carved tiles, and surroundings of climbing vines and towering trees.
  * **The sleek, contemporary Germaine Marvel Building** was designed to host stellar indoor affairs, thanks to its flexible open-concept floor plan. You also have the option to host a reception in the airy tented Rotary Event Plaza, which overlooks lovely Quinn Strong Park.
