## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This beautifully restored train station dating back to the 19th century** retains much of its original charm, from the reconstructed porte-cochère at the front entrance to the stained-glass windows that provide a golden glow in the evening. 
  * **The romantic Belvedere gazebo on the Event Lawn** offers a picture-perfect backdrop for an outdoor ceremony. Other open-air options are the covered Trackside Courtyard (once a train platform) and the rebuilt Log House, featuring timber from the Revolutionary War. 
  * **Carefully preserved historical details in the 1897 Event Room** include an intricate marble mosaic floor, a box beam ceiling, and gleaming brass railings. It's fully outfitted with tables, gold Chiavari chairs, a sound system and video screen, plus a catering kitchen.
