## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Situated right on the banks of Lake Saganana,** this private, northern Minnesota lodge boasts peaceful water and forest views, on-site lodging for a crowd, and prime access to all-season adventure.
  * **A spacious yard leads from the lodge to the lake,** providing ample space for outdoor ceremonies and receptions, and the pretty dock that stretches out from the shore makes a beautiful spot for photos. 
  * **Accommodations for up to twenty are available in the lodge,** and ten more guests can be housed in Top of the Trail Cabin. Both include the use of loads of family-friendly amenities—a camp fire pit, boat launch, sauna, and more. Pets are welcome, too!
