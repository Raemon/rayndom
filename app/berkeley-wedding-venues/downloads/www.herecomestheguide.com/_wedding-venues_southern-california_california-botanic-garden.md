## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **The nation's largest garden dedicated to California's native plants, this botanical wonderland** encompasses 86 acres of juniper and Torrey pine woodlands, chaparral deserts, wildflower meadows, burbling streams, and curated walking paths. In addition to its extensive horticultural collections, the venue boasts multiple gorgeous outdoor event spaces—accommodating guest counts from 10–400—and a curated list of exceptional preferred caterers.
  * **The nature-inspired design of the Lewis Family Forest Center** makes it feel as though it has risen naturally from its scenic surroundings. The structure's dramatic stone walls and metal-and-wood canopy are softened by the rustling leaves of sycamores and oaks, the burbling of a fountain, and the glow of surrounding lights. 
  * **Sweeping vistas of the San Gabriel mountains backdrop celebrations in the California Courtyard,** which is set amid mature redwoods, oaks, and fountain grasses, and accented by a dynamic bronze sculpture. For a slightly more intimate feel, we love the California Cultivar Garden, where you can say "I do" beneath a vine-draped Craftsman gazebo, or the secluded streamside setting of the Percy C. Everett Memorial Garden.
