## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Warm, welcoming, and filled with historical charm** , this Birmingham banquet hall built in 1914 has been delightfully restored, with a gleaming century-old hardwood floor, exposed brick walls, and a high ceiling inset with huge wooden beams.
  * **You can hold both your ceremony and reception in the hall** , with staff ready to help you with the transition. The adjacent lobby offers plenty of room for serving cocktails—from the in-house fully stocked bar service.
  * **A furnished guest suite for wedding preparations is included** in the site rental, as are banquet chairs and tables. You can conveniently add extras such as a selfie photo station, a coat check, linens, dinnerware, a champagne greeting, and more.
