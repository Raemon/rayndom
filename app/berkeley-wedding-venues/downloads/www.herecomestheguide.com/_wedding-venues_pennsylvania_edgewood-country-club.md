##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

  * **This beautiful golf club boasts acres of rolling green hills,** lush woodlands, and a modern, stylish clubhouse—just 15 minutes from central Pittsburgh. 
  * **Exchange vows on a fairway meadow,** followed by a grand reception in the main ballroom. It boasts a dramatic vaulted ceiling, and an elevated porch overlooking the golf course. 
  * **Their intimate event rooms are wonderful, too—** we love the Fireside Room, with its exposed brick wall inset with a gas fireplace, just perfect for a cozy wedding on a chilly winter evening.
