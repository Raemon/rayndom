## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Walk down the same aisle couples have for 140 years.** Originally built in 1875, this downtown Raleigh chapel boasts an open floor plan, 18-foot ceilings, and stunning original details throughout, from the façade's pointed arches to the wooden aisles leading to the gothic cross configuration inside.
  * **Gorgeous stained glass above the altar** , clerestory windows flooding the space with natural light, and intricately detailed woodwork create a charmingly timeless interior. Reception area options include a lower-level reception hall or the main chapel itself, which is easily "flipped" from your ceremony to provide a gracious space for dinner and dancing.
  * **You'll have plenty of time to enjoy** , with ceremony-only packages running a full four hours and ceremony & reception packages starting at nine hours, with an option to add additional time. Two ample dressing suites are also available for wedding party prep.
