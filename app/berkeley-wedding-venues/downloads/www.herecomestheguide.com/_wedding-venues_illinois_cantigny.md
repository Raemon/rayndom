## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Glorious gardens make this expansive estate a dream wedding locale.** Once home to the family behind the Chicago Tribune, it's now a public park that includes historic museums, expansive gardens, and a 27-hole championship golf course.
  * **The Rose Garden, complete with an ornate gazebo, is utterly romantic,** private and located adjacent to Le Jardin. The terrace East Lawn, outside McCormick House, offers a more formal elegance. Opt for an exchange of vows in the serene Rock Garden, or secluded Praire View.
  * **Enjoy the open space of Le Jardin for a reception** that almost glitters from the illuminated grounds at night. Alternately, celebrate in the Red Oak Room, newly renovated in 2026 and now the largest space, with panoramic views of the golf course and Swan Lake, or the Woodside Pavilion at Cantigny Golf, a premium tented venue with beautiful views and flexible floor plan options.
