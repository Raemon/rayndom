  * **Experience stunning settings, each inspired by Arizona's natural beauty,** for both your ceremony and reception. The serene Desert Garden is a dreamy oasis, with natural textures, a shallow reflecting pool, and a grove of lovely mesquite trees, while the Waterfall Terrace overlooks the golf course, and the expansive Lawn Court is framed by manicured greenery and trees, providing a secluded feel.
