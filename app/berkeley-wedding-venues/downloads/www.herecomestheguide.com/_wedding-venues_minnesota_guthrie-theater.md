##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

  * **Located in the historic Riverfront District** , steps from the city's best hotels, dining, and culture, the Guthrie Theater presents dramatic event spaces and stunning views, making this Minneapolis icon an excellent choice for a wedding that wins raves.
  * **You're the star, so you may as well take the stage.** Host a grand dinner in the black-box style Dowling Studio, which is easily transformed into any backdrop you envision. The iconic cantilevered Endless Bridge space and its adjoining Jundt Terrace wow with bridge and river vistas.
  * **The one-of-a-kind glass-walled Amber Box boasts breathtaking panoramas** of the Stone Arch Bridge and Mississippi River, Gold Medal Park, and the Minneapolis cityscape through floor-to-ceiling amber-tinted windows. And, thanks to the talented in-house events & production teams, there'll be enough theatrical flair to guarantee a smash hit.
