## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Surrounded by over seven acres of natural beauty, this 1919 Colonial Revival-style estate** was made for entertaining. Over its life, the home has played host to an impressive roster of guests, including Herbert Hoover and Carl Sandburg, who also enjoyed the winding brick paths, manicured shrubs, and colorful flower beds that still call the site home.
  * **Bring your secret garden wedding dreams to life in the walled boxwood garden.** Featuring a gracious lawn, romantic patio, and wisteria-draped pergola, there's plenty of space for a magical ceremony or tented reception on the grounds. The grand brick mansion peeks out over the walls, creating a feeling of seclusion.
  * **Indoor spaces are equally lovely: celebrations may be held in the** **Mount Vernon Unitarian Church,** a modern Meeting House accented by a stunning circular pane of stained glass, or in Hollin Hall itself, where guests are treated to the home's gorgeous original architectural details and beautiful antiques.
