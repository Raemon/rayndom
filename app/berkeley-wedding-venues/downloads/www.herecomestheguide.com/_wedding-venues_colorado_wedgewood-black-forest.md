  * **Magnificent forested meadows provide a fairytale setting for exchanging vows beneath a wooden arbor.** The towering spruce and seasonal foliage also make striking photo backdrops. Want more photo goodness? The famous "Garden of the Gods" is close by so you can sneak away for those dramatic wedding portraits while guests are enjoying cocktail hour. 
  * **The spacious ballroom is the epitome of rustic elegance, with vaulted ceilings and dazzling crystal chandeliers.** Plus, your luxurious reception experience is enhanced by views of Colorado’s rural wilderness through large windows that open to the outdoor terrace. A dedicated indoor wedding chapel means you can get married here any time of year. Spacious get-ready rooms round out this venue's event-friendly offerings.
  * **Your personal Wedgewood Weddings expert will guide you** through their customizable package options. From all-inclusive to à la carte, she’ll work with you to ensure that you not only get the best value, but also the wedding you always dreamed of.
