## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Modeled after the elegant greenhouses—“orangeries”—** often found on grounds of French chateaus, this Victorian-inspired beauty sits beside a large pond, with natural, photo-friendly surroundings of unspoiled meadows and woodlands. 
  * **Walls of arched glass windows are framed with elegant scrollwork,** while chandeliers and classic flooring add a touch of glam. An impressive skylight runs the entire length of the space, letting in still more natural light. 
  * **A spacious courtyard offers you the flexibility to host an indoor/outdoor celebration—** perhaps vows beside the tranquil pond, followed by a romantic dinner in the orangerie. Weekend long packages are available that include use of a charming four-bedroom farmhouse.
