## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Set along iconic Bayshore Boulevard** and offering sweeping views of Hillsborough Bay, this hidden Tampa gem is surrounded by three acres of lawns and artfully landscaped gardens. 
  * **Say “I do” in the Wedding Garden,** with its lush tropical plantings and moss-draped oaks. Follow with cocktails on the lawn or in the Conservatory, which opens to the airy, modern ballroom whose floor-to-ceiling windows overlook the bay. 
  * **It’s a non-profit organization,** so your rental fees help support the Garden Club’s mission to provide educational resources and opportunities throughout the Tampa area that promote a love of gardening, as well as civic and environmental stewardship.
