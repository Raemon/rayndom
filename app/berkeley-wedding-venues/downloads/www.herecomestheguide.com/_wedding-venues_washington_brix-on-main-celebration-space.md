  * **Occupying its own quaint corner of Buckley’s historic Main Street,** this lovely space is owned and operated by two friends who happen to be event industry pros, so you’ll know your celebration is in the most capable of hands. 
  * **Weathered brick, oversized arched windows,** polished concrete flooring, and vintage-inspired lighting combine to create an ideal canvas with which to style your dream celebration—virtually any theme will work beautifully here.
  * **There are two separate dressing suites,** each filled with natural light to ensure wonderful photos, as well as a pretty bar and well-appointed prep kitchen. Rates are extremely reasonable, and they offer special packages for elopements and micro-weddings.
