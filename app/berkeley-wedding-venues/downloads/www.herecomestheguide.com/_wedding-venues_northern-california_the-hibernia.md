## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This iconic 1892 treasure****is a grand example of Beaux Arts architecture – the style originally introduced to San Francisco by the architect, Albert Pissis.** With its prominent corner location and dramatic stained glass dome, it’s been a beloved San Francisco landmark for over 125 years. 
  * **The Main Hall is dressed to impress,** with a soaring 30-foot ceiling, massive arched windows, and ornately gilded fixtures—it's a truly striking celebration room. Downstairs, though, you’ll find something completely different: an industrial-chic, warehouse-style space with a distinct nightclub vibe. 
  * **Move up, up, up to the Penthouse and Roof Deck** for yet another unforgettable experience. Here, you’ll dine and dance surrounded by the Mid-Market skyline, with a breathtaking, close-up view of the building’s colorful dome.
