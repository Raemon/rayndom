## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Sitting at the edge of the Anacostia River,** this unique venue features a sleek, modern façade of undulating glass and three stories of innovative, contemporary indoor/outdoor spaces.
  * **Host a reception in the soaring Rotunda** with its glass walls overlooking the river, followed by cocktails and celebrating in the spacious lobby, on the patio, or—our favorite—on the serpentine rooftop.
  * **Your rental fees help support Blue Drop,** a nonprofit with a mission to relieve economic strain on DC-area ratepayers. Plus, the venue is LEED Platinum+ certified, so you can feel great about hosting an event with minimal environmental impact.
