  * **Celebrations unfold across multiple indoor and outdoor spaces:** You might say “I do” beneath the towering sycamores in Beverly Park, mingle over canapés in the landscaped courtyard, gather for dinner under the twinkle lights, or head inside to party in the cool, retro-inspired Garland Ballroom.
  * **In-house catering is provided by the award-winning chefs at The Front Porch,** with customized menus inspired by fresh, locally sourced ingredients and L.A.’s iconic food scene. There’s even lodging for your loved ones onsite, in modern, well-appointed guest rooms just a short trolley ride from Universal.
