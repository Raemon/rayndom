## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **They’ve preserved the history of this 1929 building** , while making it feel utterly modern. This refurbished refinery near the Pearl District offers 10,000 square feet of open space in a venue so versatile it can be configured for intimate affairs or gala weddings.
  * **You get killer views of the Fremont Bridge.** Plus, tons of natural light streaming through the original wraparound steel sash windows, which they wisely retained along with other architectural details like the great 14-foot, exposed wood-beam ceilings.
  * **Yes, you can have industrial chic AND a garden too.** In addition to Castaway’s outdoor patio, you have the option of renting neighboring Versailles Garden, filled with European statuary and a greenhouse, or the nearby Pomarius Nursery, bursting with trees and greenery.
