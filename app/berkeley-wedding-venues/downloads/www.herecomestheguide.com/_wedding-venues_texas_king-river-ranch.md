## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **At this pristine private estate, intimate weddings are a passion and specialty.** Nestled on 25 gorgeous acres of Hill Country beauty, it encompasses wildflower-studded meadows, rolling horse pastures, rocky riverbanks, and a tranquil fishing pond.
  * **Descend a wide stone staircase to your ceremony on the expansive River Terrace,** which sits amid lush natural landscaping on the edge of the scenic Pedernales River. When it's available, you also have the option to celebrate in the King Barn, a rustic gem build entirely of ponderosa pine.
  * **The amenities are truly luxurious:** think plush lounge furniture, a makeup & hair studio, and an on-site concierge. The best perk, of course, is the pastoral property itself, which is yours to explore with your photographer. Don't forget to greet the friendly farm animals (or invite them to join in your photos!).
