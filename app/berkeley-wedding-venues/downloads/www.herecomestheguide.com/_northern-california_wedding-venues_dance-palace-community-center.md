## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This historic former church-turned-dance hall,** set in beautiful Point Reyes Station, is the beating heart of the West Marin community. Your (very affordable!) rental fees go directly towards preserving this beautiful site and providing diverse educational and cultural programs to the area.
  * **The Main Hall is warm and inviting** , with hardwood floors, a pretty open-beamed ceiling, natural lighting, and a set of French doors that lead onto a large patio and rolling lawn, perfect for toasting with cocktails after you say “I do.”
  * **Intimate ceremonies are lovely in the Church** , which is flooded with light thanks to the tall Palladian windows that line its wood-paneled walls. Its charming white exterior is incredibly photogenic, as are the surrounding gardens, meadows, and nearby ecological preserve.
