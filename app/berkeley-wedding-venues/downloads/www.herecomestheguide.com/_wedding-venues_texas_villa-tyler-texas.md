## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **A little bit of Tuscany in the heart of the Lone Star State,** this 29-acre east Texas gem boasts charming Old World-inspired architecture, manicured gardens, and views that will have guests feeling like they’ve been transported to the Italian countryside.
  * **At the end of a stone-stamped pathway,** flanked by towering cypress trees, you’ll find the Wedding Pergola, whose graceful arches evoke the garden ruins of an ancient villa. In case of uncooperative weather, you’ll find a beautiful alternative in the Tuscany Room—complete with a backdrop of arches.
  * **Designed to bring the outdoors inside, the dramatic Bella Room** mimics a traditional piazza. Surrounded by two stories of windows, it features a quaint balcony, vintage-style sconces, and a deeply hued, 20-foot ceiling inset with twinkling fiber-optic stars.
