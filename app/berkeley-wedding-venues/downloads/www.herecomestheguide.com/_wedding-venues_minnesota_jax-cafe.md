## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Family run since 1910,** this historic spot has long been a favorite in its Northern Minneapolis neighborhood, beloved for its welcoming staff, warm atmosphere, and the uncompromising quality of its menu.
  * **Whether you opt for a room that’s grand or intimate,** you’ll be treated to charming details like coffered ceilings of dark wood, crackling fireplaces, and inviting lighting provided by vintage-style chandeliers and sconces. 
  * **We’re especially taken with the Cavalier Bar—** used on its own for an intimate cocktail party or in conjunction with the elegant Cosmopolitan Room, it’s certain to delight your guests with its cozy, den-inspired vibe.
