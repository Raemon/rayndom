## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **A Mediterranean-inspired clubhouse,** perched on a beautiful vantage atop a small hill, is at the heart of this lovely golf club. In addition to its stylish architecture and fabulous views, the club is known for its exceptional planning staff and topnotch culinary team, who have given this site a reputation for consistently serving delectable meals.
  * **Quintessential golf course ceremonies are held on a flower-lined lawn** set between a tranquil lake and a large putting green. After the "I do"s, your guests can mingle on the Terrace while you snap romantic portraits on the landscaped greens, beside the sparkling lake, and in front of the clubhouse's stunning, multi-tiered fountain.
  * **From the grand flagstone-paved Terrace,** the views extend over a putting green and beyond toward three long verdant fairways, each defined by borders of mature trees. Just inside, you'll find the spacious ballroom, which boasts 18-foot ceilings, elegant sconces, and a wall of sun-loving windows and French doors.
