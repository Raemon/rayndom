## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **One of the Poconos most beloved resorts,** this lovely spot on the shore of Lake Teedyuskung offers an all-inclusive experience in a dreamy mountain setting. With two year-round venues that can host events both indoors and out, you’ll have tons of flexibility in crafting the wedding you’ve been dreaming of. 
  * **At The Inn on Lake Teedyuskung, you’ll find classically elegant dining rooms** that each boast views of the lake, and an absolutely stunning waterfront ceremony site. Breathtaking mountain panoramas are the hallmark of The Clubhouse at Woodloch Springs, nestled at the heart of a lush championship golf course. 
  * **The resort features an array of accommodation choices,** from traditional hotel-style rooms and suites, to vacation rentals large enough for groups and families. Your guests can fill their weekend with Woodloch’s roster of daily planned activities, or use the resort as a launching point to explore the Poconos.
