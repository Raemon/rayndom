## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Considered one the great “golden era” golf clubs,** this beautiful property features lush surroundings with mature trees, tranquil water features, and a beautifully maintained vintage clubhouse. 
  * **The elegant main ballroom features delicate crystal chandeliers,** a dedicated bar space, and grand windows along the walls that let in natural light and views of the golf course’s rolling hills. 
  * **In warmer months, the charming courtyard** allows events to become indoor/outdoor affairs, with two covered pergolas and a spacious lawn for ceremonies and cocktail hours.
