## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Lakeside ceremonies surrounded by the verdant gardens** are a gorgeous way to begin your life together. The floating pier is a perfect spot for photographs!
  * **A grand stone fireplace and timber-frame ceiling in the Ballroom** make for a warm and inviting atmosphere. The adjacent terrace lets you step outside and enjoy the view of the mountains.
  * **Newly renovated guest rooms, including four junior suites** , provide luxurious accommodations. A nightly bonfire with s’mores and a full-service marina will keep everyone in your party entertained.
