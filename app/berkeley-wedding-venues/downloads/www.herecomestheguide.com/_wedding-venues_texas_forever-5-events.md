## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Set at the heart of sixteen wooded acres** that are dotted with ponds and lovely, photo-friendly features (hello, romantic footbridge!), this family-run event space boasts a warm, nature-centered vibe and a location that’s an easy drive from Houston, Huntsville, and The Woodlands.
  * **It’s hard not to fall in love with the dreamy outdoor ceremony spot.** Here, mature trees surround a series of 24-foot, ivy-entwined arches to create a soaring open-air “chapel”, where your guests will sit, shaded by ancient limbs, as you exchange vows between two graceful weeping willows. 
  * **The airy celebration room is filled with natural light,** thanks to tons of oversized windows and a whitewashed ceiling hung with unique, modern teardrop lighting. Touches like a weathered black brick, an entry wall of vertical wood slats, and polished concrete flooring add to the sleek, contemporary vibe.
