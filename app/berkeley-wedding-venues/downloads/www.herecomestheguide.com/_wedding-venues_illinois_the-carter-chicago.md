## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

  * **With its chic, urban design and wide-open floor plan,** this thoughtfully renovated private event space is an incredible canvas on which to create the celebration you envision. 
  * **Inside, exposed brick walls, cool poured concrete flooring,** and a high ceiling with exposed industrial-style rafters create a loft-inspired vibe. Huge windows allow natural light to fill the room, and eight crystal chandeliers illuminate the party once the sun goes down.
