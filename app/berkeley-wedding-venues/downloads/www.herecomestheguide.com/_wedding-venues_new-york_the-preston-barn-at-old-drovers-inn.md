## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Located on the grounds of the 18th-century Old Drovers Inn** , this venue is a Hudson Valley treasure. And its location—just 80 miles north of NYC—makes it ideal for a weekend of exploring the surrounding wineries, farms, and hiking trails. 
  * **The Barn was custom-built for hosting unforgettable parties.** Details like hand-hewn beams, a cathedral ceiling, and a floor made of reclaimed barn wood give the space a historic feel...but it's fully climate-controlled for year-round fun. 
  * **Oversized double doors open onto a quaint stone patio.** Set with lounge furniture and lit by strings of market lights, it's the perfect spot for a cocktail hour or an intimate outdoor ceremony.
