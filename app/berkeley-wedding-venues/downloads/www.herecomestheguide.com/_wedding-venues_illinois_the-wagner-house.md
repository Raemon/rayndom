Read More Show Less

****

  * **Once home to the Wagner Printing Company,** this turn-of-the-century gem has been artfully and creatively renovated for a new life as a mixed-use building, housing a collection of fabulous event rooms and perched right in the heart of Freeport’s historic downtown.
  * **In the third-floor Green Room,****you’ll find a dreamy vintage-industrial space** with exposed ductwork, weathered brick walls, rows of arched windows, and antique-inspired lighting. An open, flexible floor plan allows you to design the flow of your party exactly as you wish.
  * **Percy’s Speakeasy is your spot for intimate micro-weddings** or glam bachelor/bachelorette parties, with its inviting, loungy vibe. For your day-of preparations, there’s a light-filled suite with loads of room to spread out.
