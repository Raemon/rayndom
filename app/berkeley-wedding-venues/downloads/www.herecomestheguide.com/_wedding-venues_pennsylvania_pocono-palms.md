## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Owned and operated by a pair of sisters,** this former church has been artfully reimagined as an ultra-stylish event space. It’s nestled in the heart of the Poconos, making it easily accessible from both NYC and Philadelphia. 
  * **There’s a lovely garden courtyard****with a hidden oasis feel** that’s just right for saying “I do.” Once inside the reception hall, you’ll find a soaring cathedral ceiling with exposed dark wood buttresses, sleek retro checkered flooring, and enormous arched windows allowing for ample natural light.
  * **They offer so many thoughtful extras,** like custom herringbone tables, a glam dressing area, a cute outdoor bar area and fire pit, and a thoroughly vetted list of local caterers at a variety of price points, all of whom are familiar with the venue’s unique setup.
