## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Relaxed yet elegant, this charming golf club** brings emerald fairways and picturesque mountain views to every event. Located just a few miles from busy San Diego but with a worlds-away feel, the setting is perfect for indoor/outdoor celebrations. Plus, you'll be treated to excellent personalized service: the food selections are varied and creative, and you'll have a dedicated event manager at your wedding from start to finish.
  * **S****tart with "first look" shots on the waterfront** at the nearby Sweetwater Summit Regional Park, where the lush 500-acre expanse and built-in amphitheater provide photogenic backdrops. Then, make your way back to BGC for your ceremony and reception.
  * **Exchange vows on a manicured putting green,** which glows with the afternoon light**** over Mt. Miguel.**** Just steps away is the**** fresh, contemporary ballroom, which boast a series of large windows that fill the room with natural light, a tasteful, creamy, color palette to complement any décor, and an elevated stage to perfectly showcase your head table or wedding cake.
