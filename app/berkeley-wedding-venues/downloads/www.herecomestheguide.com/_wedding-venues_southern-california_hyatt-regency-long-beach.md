## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This premier waterfront hotel, the area's****only 4 Diamond Award-winner,** is also a sophisticated, modern setting for Long Beach weddings. Guests will love its location in the heart of downtown, within walking distance of endless area attractions, shopping, and restaurants, and you'll love how easy it is—with all-inclusive packages that showcase expert staff, delicious cuisine, and diverse venues, planning your dream day here is a breeze.
  * **Arrive in style in a romantic gondola, gliding across the Rainbow Lagoon** to your ceremony on the palm-studded lawn. Receptions follow in the ballroom of your choice: the Beacon boasts floor-to-ceiling windows with sweeping ocean vistas; the Seaview's soaring four-story Atrium floods the space with light; and the expansive Regency is adorned with glimmering recessed chandeliers for a particularly luxurious feel.
  * **When it comes to cultural celebrations, you're in experienced hands.** Multiple spaces—some accommodating up to 900 guests—mean you can host a whole range of events on site, without having to worry about transportation. They're also happy to accommodate outside catering, which you'll enjoy alongside the same exceptional service and amenities as traditional packages.
