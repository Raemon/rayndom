## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This performing arts center is a delightfully elegant and modern venue** in the heart of Fort Collins. Recently renovated, it offers both indoor and outdoor spaces that can accommodate even the largest ceremony and reception.
  * **Surrounded by treetops and strung with Tivoli lights****, the Rooftop Deck** on the second floor is an airy spot for an event. Downstairs, the expansive Terrace, with garden greenery and a sparkling fountain, is another option for celebrating under the stars.
  * **The grand Canyon West & Columbine Ballrooms, with their coffered ceilings, chandeliers**, and dark wood accents, provide a dramatically lit backdrop for dinner and dancing. For a memorable cocktail hour beforehand, invite guests to mingle in the on-site art gallery.
