## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Lush, relaxed, and private, this quiet country estate** boasts two beautiful, secluded venues, both with wonderful mountain views and exquisite landscaping designed to provide bountiful color in every season. 
  * **Make your grand entrance into the airy, covered outdoor chapel** through a set of heavy wood entry doors, or exchange vows on the grassy ceremony lawn. Follow with a reception in the Gardens ballroom, with a row of glass doors that open onto a terrace, inviting guests to step outside and admire the vistas.
  * **Another option is the Grand, which offers an upscale, modern vibe**. Inside its chic stone-accented exterior, you'll find matte black accent walls, a built-in marble-top bar, and–of course!–enormous windows that flood the space with natural light.
