## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Industrial elegance and modern amenities combine to create this fabulous space,** built pre-1920s in the heart of Chicago's popular West Loop neighborhood. It's now managed and run by the innovative crew at Atomic Hospitality, who will work closely with you to generate exciting ideas for your big day... and then bring them to vibrant life.
  * **In the column-less main hall most of the original brick has been preserved,** along with the soaring trussed ceiling, 20-foot clerestory windows, and skylights that run the length of the building. Contemporary additions include a 38-foot marble bar, laser-cut Art Deco-style panels, and an upper level, where you'll find a spacious wedding suite.
  * **Glass-paneled garage doors in the adjoining bar, Recess, lead onto the spacious patio,** a charming urban space made for mingling.**** Between the 40-foot wooden bar that anchors the indoor space and the two repurposed shipping containers that transform into outdoor bars, your guests will never have to wait long for their next cocktail.
