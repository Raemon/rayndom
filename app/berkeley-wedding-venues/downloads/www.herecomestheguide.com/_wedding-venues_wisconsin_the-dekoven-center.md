## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Soak in sweeping views of Lake Michigan** from this lush, eleven acre campus. Once home to Racine College and dating back to the 1850s, it’s home to beautifully preserved American Gothic buildings, peaceful walking paths, and bountiful mature trees and landscaping.
  * **Wed in St. John’s Chapel,** the Center’s quaint, European-style church sanctuary, or opt for a colorful garden ceremony during the warmer months. Intimate receptions are right at home in the Assembly Hall, and larger ones are welcomed in the Great Hall; both spaces boast an open, gracious feel with lots of charming vintage details.
  * **Two sweet apartments, located in the historic gatehouse,** may be rented for overnight stays. With private baths, well-equipped kitchens, and plenty of room to spread out, they can serve as an ideal home base for the wedding weekend, as well as separate dressing suites on the big day.
