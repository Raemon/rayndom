## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **With its beautifully preserved collection of buildings, some dating to the 1700s,** this Ridgefield museum offers countless spots for charming photo backdrops, including a red carriage house, and a classic white New England colonial tavern.
  * **The Garden House was built in 1915 expressly for entertaining,** and features French doors on three sides, with marble steps that lead to a lovely walled garden. Exchange vows here, beside the reflecting pool and amid lush seasonal plantings, then let the party flow between the gardens and the intimate, light-filled rooms of the house.
  * **Your rental fees help support the Museum in so many ways—** among them: funding educational programs, cultural events, and preservation of buildings and artifacts. When you get married here, you become part of both its history and legacy.
