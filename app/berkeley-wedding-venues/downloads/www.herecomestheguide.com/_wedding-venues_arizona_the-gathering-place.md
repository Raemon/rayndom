  * **Wed in a clearing surrounded by towering Ponderosa pines—** an iconically "Arizona" scene—then follow with a reception in the beautiful barn, which features warm wood siding and strings of romantic Edison lights.
  * **Packages are flexible, affordable, and offer a ton of generous inclusions;** décor, linens, and so much more. (Be sure to ask about their micro-wedding options!) You’ll adore the dressing suite, with its rustic elegant design, ample natural light, and dedicated makeup stations.
