## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **A true hidden gem, this tucked-away modern barn** on a lakeside homestead is surrounded by lush woods and verdant meadows that set an easygoing ranch vibe for your day.
  * **Ceremonies unfold on the soft lawn outside the barn,** where a stamped concrete pathway leads from the well-appointed dressing rooms right to the pretty arbor where you’ll say “I do.” Head back inside for dining and dancing, where you’ll find a loft staircase, built-in sound, and a projector for toasts or slideshows.
  * **Make it a weekend retreat by staying over in the on-site lake cabins.** The four-bedroom Lodge is located just steps from the barn, making it perfect for the wedding party, while you can also opt to reserve the quaint Farmhouse, adorable Tiny House, and airy, modern Gray House. Your furry family is welcome here too!
